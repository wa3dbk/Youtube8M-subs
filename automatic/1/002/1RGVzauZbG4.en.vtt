00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:08.710
 hello castres today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.750
 make one of these very beautiful cards 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.970
 you already know that you can adapt it 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.160
 for the vocation that you want or 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.380
 with the paper that they like and then 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.199
 well this time I'm going to use this 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:23.439
 paper that is called this tree of the 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:25.900
 state tape brand of a designer very 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.699
 good that is called my children the time of 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.470
 be slide to the collection to me 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:31.929
 like very much because it's like between is 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.270
 cute and not so much and well I'm going to 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:38.910
 cut from this one that is leaves a 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:42.300
 4 x 6 inch rectangle of each 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.150
 and well once I have these two 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.220
 pieces then I go with my rule to do 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.160
 some lines that are as in tÃ¡chira 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.960
 where by the whole sheet I'm just going to 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.030
 mark well with my pencil and clear if 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.440
 I want to explain this step to do it 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:02.000
 with the pencil or you can not do it with 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.000
 directly your cutter or with an exact 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.490
 and if you do not have any of the two you can 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.700
 be directly with your scissors in this 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:14.360
 occasion I am using this rule 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:17.060
 Magnetic and Magnetic Cutting Mat 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.460
 of we are memory keeper's and also this 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.000
 of the mask did not change and the 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.680
 truth is that they are very tools 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.510
 essential for me and after having them 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.830
 tried I promise you that we will not want 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.570
 return to what you had before 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.790
 do not forget to subscribe to this 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.890
 channel because we have ideas every week 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.420
 very good that I'm sure you're going to 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.000
 help a lot either in your business 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.800
 to make some detail to that person 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.350
 special or just because you love it 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.820
 and balkans make escape and crafts 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.340
 with paper 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.560
 ok here comes an interesting part 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.110
 let's start to put together the 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.360
 different pieces that we have one of the 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.130
 squares like the ones we had before and 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.800
 since we are going to paste it on top of a 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.540
 Piece of paper can be 4 x white 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.910
 6 inches and we're going to put it together 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.130
 way I here I already have the two stuck 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.709
 and now I'm going with this tool so 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.260
 peculiar that is called show and yes that is 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.850
 a little head he has there are little houses 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.220
 interchangeable to be able to do 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.709
 different stitches and this time 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.580
 I'm using the fiscal keys 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.040
 then when with the block of 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.790
 Acrylic I go daily to see where 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.459
 I'm going to do these counted or these these 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.160
 crimes to allow us now 5 be the 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.980
 folder and with this then it is very simple 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.010
 just press on a rug 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.780
 foami and I pass it as it was very very 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.640
 thick on paper that I put down and 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.820
 also good what I put up then 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.860
 just did not pass the paper with these 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.630
 perforations in other ways and to 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.560
 has marked and the only kilo that I am 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.520
 doing is 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.890
 pierce them completely with a punch 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.989
 and this is simply so that the needle 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.849
 pass without any problem the truth is 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.739
 that the little card makes of precious 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:03.260
 but if you do not like this thing of 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.989
 potter so much you can skip it and 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.120
 I gave myself as super brave and decided 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.680
 do it but I say if you do not do it does not happen 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.400
 nothing this way is going to look super 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.490
 cute 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.980
 now cut a piece of paper 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.510
 of 3 inches by 2 in which fits me 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.750
 but this 36 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.490
 nihat and ben spies airways and is part of 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.710
 this collection of six ping chairs 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.840
 books of the most precious as more 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.210
 they have their makes but less those of stories 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.000
 more of those now I'm just going there to 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:35.030
 put the stamp with black ink and on 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.240
 viveiro loved it and this I am going to put 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.280
 on the card with some funds and 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.170
 there I will put some red beads that 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.330
 they will give that touch as super beautiful 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.940
 and it also looks perfect with the background 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.980
 the truth is a simple head very 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.360
 simple and if you do not want to know 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.790
 Well, there's no problem 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.060
 just do not put things on you has been the 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:59.180
 paper nothing more like coinciding a 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.220
 part with the other one is very pretty you're 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.050
 superior if you do not have these successes 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.460
 obviously you can use the ones that you 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.620
 I want to know that you will also be left 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.810
 beautiful with some other design that you make 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.570
 this is simply an idea there 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.410
 I just put some little things that 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:17.480
 they call box wine or some dotted lines 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.760
 I love it because these lines and the 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.160
 part of the sewing as it has been common 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.920
 It is very handmade very homemade but 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.200
 really nice and professional I liked it 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.750
 very much that life I hope that also if 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.630
 you like it or not, do it, I'm not going to 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.400

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.620
