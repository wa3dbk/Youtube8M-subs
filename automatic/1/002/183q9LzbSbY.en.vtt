 hello how about friends today in this video is 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:11.620
 show you how to remove advertising 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:16.480
 of applications or games for android 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.480
 this also this method serves to 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:25.890
 thanks to patching the same application in 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:29.000
 his games well what would crack and 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.540
 the chat 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.800
 and when creating in a game or 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.780
 application 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:40.020
 I mean the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.800
 for example grows this is an application 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:48.320
 of some video from here on youtube and 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:52.460
 well at the time of which you are going 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:58.810
 that you confirm that you have bought this 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:01:03.120
 Google application or framing and web 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:06.700
 then he had so they do yogis rap 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:11.380
 well then with this application we are going 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:13.420
 to remove that message from confirming that 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.390
 we have against this application and blah blah 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:19.000
 blah and also remove advertising from 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.520
 games or applications or the 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.120
 application that we will use will be lucky for 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.400
 be this is the latest version 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:30.640
 currently in the same way every time 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:34.560
 leave an update 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:37.380
 the same application not for a little message 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.680
 that we must update the application and 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.540
 we are going to update and now 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.240
 automatically update time 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.390
 in this case I'm going to teach you a 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.920
 application that would be to be mate that 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.920
 has advertising 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.909
 Yemen 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:09.220
 the time I loaded this 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:15.530
 good 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:18.170
 event since the application 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.760
 very important the application that we go 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.760
 to create parts 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.420
 Y 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:47.950
 I think if you press me home well 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:52.030
 we will audio to and let's see 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:55.590
 now open patch menu that yes 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.590
 we want to eliminate advertising 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.430
 6 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:11.120
 and we will select the following 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.730
 squares this and these are these five 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.810
 boxes are selected for the 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.080
 Right 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.380
 the correct installation of the patches 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:26.210
 okay 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:29.810
 let's apply we hope and well this 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:32.960
 application requires internet is 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:37.780
 connected to an internet network to 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:42.700
 can do and execute can execute 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.700
 the correct installation of the patches 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:50.910
 and here we have to wait for some good 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.910
 minutes for seconds 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:58.739
 to find us the 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.739
 is part of the desired application 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.340
 as you come here has told me results 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:14.129
 correct correct correct Mayo College 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:16.829
 44 results correct results that 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:19.500
 they are written in green and 1 in a 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:23.520
 correct that is written in red and that 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:26.940
 failure but that does not matter my those of 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:31.320
 3 correct and it does not matter if they give us the 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:32.960
 other incorrect or failures in the patch 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.910
 has been executed so 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:42.050
 that is relevant here will 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:44.210
 accept and if your case is of this one 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.090
 and what to patch the application for here 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.840
 they no longer have messages to check that you have 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.879
 purchased the application we will remove 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.460
 license verification ok 

00:04:52.879 --> 00:05:00.449
 here elb four selections stress 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:02.370
 sorry well how the world is selected 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:04.850
 okay 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:08.100
 very important to use this application 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:11.510
 and enjoy this application 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:14.140
 you have to be super users 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.140
 yes 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.330
 If it 's not you 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:25.069
 on my channel be this one I have a video of 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.129
 how to make users 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:32.150
 ok well I will advance automatic modes 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:34.080
 This is the day 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:39.289
 if you 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:42.650
 this if your case is that it asks you to verify 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:45.800
 the percent amazon application takes it out 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:49.480
 is to apply and if in your case it is for 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:52.360
 samsung apps in this case 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:55.070
 osaka and their cases to none of those two 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.850
 let's go here 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.850
 verily 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:05.570
 to these two as the s 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.570
 this 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:11.270
 this is all disc 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.270
 plus 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:20.879
 home to back up on a pike to 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.879
 reinstall ok in case it's not going well 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:27.720
 because I will not do it because you do not fail me 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.910
 and we hope just as we studied 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:33.420
 removing 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:36.920
 there are a lot of google 

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.920
 of the applications 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:46.980
 this method works for almost all 

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:49.590
 applications that are in three shifts 

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:54.230
 same way is that the application has 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:07:00.560
 grown a lot and has been getting better 

00:06:54.230 --> 00:07:00.560
 and our updated application 

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:07.170
 fast has grown from pawn that is not a 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:10.230
 goal and how do you see the failures of 

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:15.030
 all the parties of the nine parts 

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:19.200
 because not because this application of mate 

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:21.330
 it does not pay me to verify the data 

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:24.810
 then it may sound faulty then 

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:27.600
 accept and now I will teach you that in 

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:30.080
 reality if you eliminate advertising from 

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.080
 Applications 

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.250
 well previously 

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:45.850
 here more a message makes me that is a 

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:49.210
 bad but it does not give us a presence here in 

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:52.390
 gandhi that's why this word state 

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:56.020
 using this application but in other 

00:07:52.390 --> 00:08:03.169
 applications do not give them any message 

00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:06.680
 of advertising so I wait in videos 

00:08:03.169 --> 00:08:11.199
 very helpful and has created and good we 

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:11.199
 we see until a next video
