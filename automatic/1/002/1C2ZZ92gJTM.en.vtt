around as you can see there's a camera

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.480 
around as you can see there's a camera
right<00:02:09.110> here<00:02:09.590> there's<00:02:09.860> one<00:02:10.040> on<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.250> other<00:02:10.280> side

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
right here there's one on the other side

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.130 
right here there's one on the other side
just<00:02:11.030> to<00:02:11.150> give<00:02:11.360> you<00:02:11.480> a<00:02:11.510> panorama<00:02:12.020> of

just to give you a panorama of

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:30.720 
just to give you a panorama of
everything<00:02:12.770> around

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.990 

now<00:02:31.870> since<00:02:32.870> this<00:02:33.080> is<00:02:33.140> a<00:02:33.260> huge<00:02:33.650> beast<00:02:34.000> you're

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
now since this is a huge beast you're

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.020 
now since this is a huge beast you're
gonna<00:02:35.150> need<00:02:35.420> a<00:02:35.450> lot<00:02:35.750> of<00:02:35.780> power<00:02:36.110> to<00:02:36.230> move<00:02:36.470> it<00:02:36.650> and

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
gonna need a lot of power to move it and

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.460 
gonna need a lot of power to move it and
don't<00:02:38.030> even<00:02:38.180> talk<00:02:38.420> about<00:02:38.480> fuel<00:02:38.870> economy<00:02:38.960> here

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
don't even talk about fuel economy here

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.890 
don't even talk about fuel economy here
so<00:02:40.040> for<00:02:40.580> this<00:02:40.730> we<00:02:40.940> have<00:02:41.060> a<00:02:41.090> five<00:02:41.390> point<00:02:41.660> six

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
so for this we have a five point six

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.860 
so for this we have a five point six
liter<00:02:42.170> v8<00:02:42.650> pushing<00:02:43.430> out<00:02:43.550> 400<00:02:44.240> horsepower<00:02:44.510> and

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
liter v8 pushing out 400 horsepower and

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.830 
liter v8 pushing out 400 horsepower and
enough<00:02:45.350> torque<00:02:45.710> to<00:02:45.890> move<00:02:46.040> a<00:02:46.160> small<00:02:46.430> moon<00:02:46.840> now

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
enough torque to move a small moon now

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.350 
enough torque to move a small moon now
this<00:02:48.470> is<00:02:48.620> all<00:02:48.770> very<00:02:49.040> pretty<00:02:49.340> but<00:02:49.730> fuel<00:02:50.150> economy

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
this is all very pretty but fuel economy

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.930 
this is all very pretty but fuel economy
was<00:02:50.860> sort<00:02:51.860> of<00:02:51.950> takes<00:02:52.130> you<00:02:52.250> down<00:02:52.400> a<00:02:52.460> little<00:02:52.730> bit

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
was sort of takes you down a little bit

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.690 
was sort of takes you down a little bit
so<00:02:53.570> in<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:53.840> end<00:02:53.960> it's<00:02:54.890> really<00:02:55.160> good<00:02:55.400> just<00:02:55.430> to

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
so in the end it's really good just to

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.560 
so in the end it's really good just to
get<00:02:55.850> offroad

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
get offroad

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.840 
get offroad
not<00:02:57.290> too<00:02:57.470> much<00:02:57.620> to<00:02:57.800> the<00:02:57.920> wheels<00:02:58.130> but<00:02:58.370> it's

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
not too much to the wheels but it's

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.400 
not too much to the wheels but it's
really<00:02:59.000> good<00:02:59.180> just<00:02:59.360> to<00:02:59.480> move<00:02:59.630> around<00:02:59.780> the<00:03:00.170> town

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
really good just to move around the town

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:21.120 
really good just to move around the town
in<00:03:00.800> pure<00:03:01.670> luxury<00:03:02.240> and<00:03:02.510> time

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.670 

now<00:03:21.760> let's<00:03:22.300> talk<00:03:22.510> about<00:03:22.630> size<00:03:22.960> brings<00:03:23.410> me<00:03:23.590> to

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
now let's talk about size brings me to

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.640 
now let's talk about size brings me to
another<00:03:23.740> point<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.880> size<00:03:25.090> of<00:03:25.300> the<00:03:25.390> trunk<00:03:25.750> now

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
another point the size of the trunk now

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.200 
another point the size of the trunk now
when<00:03:27.130> you<00:03:27.220> talk<00:03:27.430> about<00:03:27.460> the<00:03:27.790> size<00:03:28.000> of<00:03:28.120> the

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:28.210 
when you talk about the size of the

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.320 
when you talk about the size of the
trunk<00:03:28.500> usually<00:03:29.500> you<00:03:29.860> think<00:03:29.890> of<00:03:30.340> oh<00:03:30.550> great<00:03:31.150> this

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
trunk usually you think of oh great this

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:32.790 
trunk usually you think of oh great this
is<00:03:31.480> going<00:03:31.600> to<00:03:31.660> be<00:03:31.780> huge<00:03:32.050> on<00:03:32.260> the<00:03:32.350> outside<00:03:32.680> and

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
is going to be huge on the outside and

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.170 
is going to be huge on the outside and
small<00:03:33.010> on<00:03:33.130> the<00:03:33.220> inside<00:03:33.550> it's<00:03:33.820> not<00:03:33.970> so

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
small on the inside it's not so

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.120 
small on the inside it's not so
different<00:03:34.450> here<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:35.410> thing<00:03:35.620> about<00:03:35.830> it<00:03:36.010> is

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
different here the thing about it is

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.730 
different here the thing about it is
