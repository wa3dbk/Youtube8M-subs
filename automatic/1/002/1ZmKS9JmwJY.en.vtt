yep but the boss as you know already
supports<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.609> gigahertz<00:00:30.380> somehow<00:00:31.380> three<00:00:31.800> and

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
supports it gigahertz somehow three and

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.700 
supports it gigahertz somehow three and
one<00:00:33.480> thing<00:00:33.630> special<00:00:33.989> about<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.230> bore<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.410> we

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
one thing special about the bore is we

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.069 
one thing special about the bore is we
have<00:00:35.010> this<00:00:35.190> MCE<00:00:35.640> chip<00:00:35.940> on<00:00:36.120> board<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:36.989> can

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
have this MCE chip on board so you can

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.560 
have this MCE chip on board so you can
connect<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:37.710> through<00:00:38.129> this<00:00:38.489> ir<00:00:38.969> connector

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
connect you through this ir connector

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.900 
connect you through this ir connector
you<00:00:40.050> can<00:00:40.200> use<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.379> remote<00:00:40.710> control<00:00:41.190> produced<00:00:41.850> by

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
you can use a remote control produced by

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.030 
you can use a remote control produced by
biostar<00:00:42.480> which<00:00:42.899> is<00:00:43.020> also<00:00:43.200> certified<00:00:43.710> by

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
biostar which is also certified by

alright<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.170> this<00:00:46.500> become<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.920> total<00:00:47.850> solution

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
alright so this become a total solution

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.200 
alright so this become a total solution
on<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.750> other<00:00:48.930> PC<00:00:49.260> right<00:00:49.800> we'll<00:00:50.520> all<00:00:50.789> your

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
on the other PC right we'll all your

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.569 
on the other PC right we'll all your
initial<00:00:51.719> boards<00:00:51.960> about<00:00:52.050> 90<00:00:52.500> gxb<00:00:53.010> micro<00:00:53.489> ATX

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
initial boards about 90 gxb micro ATX

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.400 
initial boards about 90 gxb micro ATX
sized<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.480> can<00:00:54.510> see<00:00:54.719> that's<00:00:54.899> clearly<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.230> quite

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
sized you can see that's clearly a quite

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.990 
sized you can see that's clearly a quite
a<00:00:55.440> small<00:00:55.680> board<00:00:55.949> mm-hmm

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
a small board mm-hmm

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.700 
a small board mm-hmm
so<00:00:57.149> this<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.449> logical<00:00:57.870> replacement<00:00:58.530> for<00:00:58.649> the

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
so this is a logical replacement for the

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.569 
so this is a logical replacement for the
790<00:00:59.309> GX<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.910> 7<00:01:00.149> 8<00:01:00.270> 5<00:01:00.480> G<00:01:00.809> but<00:01:01.500> Amy's<00:01:02.190> also<00:01:02.460> going

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
790 GX and 7 8 5 G but Amy's also going

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.390 
790 GX and 7 8 5 G but Amy's also going
to<00:01:02.640> launch<00:01:02.820> separate<00:01:03.510> eight<00:01:03.660> series<00:01:04.080> 8:30<00:01:04.949> FX

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
to launch separate eight series 8:30 FX

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.640 
to launch separate eight series 8:30 FX
and<00:01:05.700> 880<00:01:06.150> G<00:01:06.479> right<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:06.990> believe<00:01:07.200> you've<00:01:07.380> got<00:01:07.409> two

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
and 880 G right I believe you've got two

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.050 
and 880 G right I believe you've got two
boards<00:01:07.950> here<00:01:08.159> yes<00:01:08.400> should<00:01:08.640> we<00:01:08.700> have<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.820> look

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
boards here yes should we have a look
