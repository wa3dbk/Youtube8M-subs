Wing chapter bulk videos again this is
the<00:03:58.030> same<00:03:58.180> reason<00:03:58.359> that<00:03:58.660> of<00:03:58.810> course<00:03:59.019> there<00:03:59.230> are

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
the same reason that of course there are

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.630 
the same reason that of course there are
some<00:03:59.470> chapters<00:03:59.739> that<00:03:59.980> don't<00:04:00.160> have<00:04:00.280> enough<00:04:00.430> law

some chapters that don't have enough law

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.490 
some chapters that don't have enough law
and<00:04:00.940> also<00:04:01.299> because<00:04:01.810> we've<00:04:01.930> been<00:04:02.049> doing<00:04:02.290> space

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
two years now I get the feeling that it

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.319 
two years now I get the feeling that it
might<00:04:06.069> be<00:04:06.310> easier<00:04:06.579> to<00:04:06.670> just<00:04:06.730> get<00:04:07.000> through<00:04:07.180> them

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:07.329 
might be easier to just get through them

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:08.640 
might be easier to just get through them
as<00:04:07.450> quickly<00:04:07.630> as<00:04:07.780> possible<00:04:07.810> whilst<00:04:08.350> still

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
giving them the spotlight that they
