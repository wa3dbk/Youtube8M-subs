know half of these people right here

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.790 
know half of these people right here
because<00:00:45.750> they've<00:00:45.930> actually<00:00:46.140> appeared<00:00:46.649> on<00:00:46.770> our

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
because they've actually appeared on our

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.310 
because they've actually appeared on our
channel<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:47.340> that's<00:00:47.550> really<00:00:47.910> cool<00:00:48.239> first<00:00:49.110> page

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
channel so that's really cool first page

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.770 
channel so that's really cool first page
here's<00:00:49.559> chaos<00:00:50.430> looking<00:00:51.059> at<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.210> map<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.719> then

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
here's chaos looking at a map and then

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.709 
here's chaos looking at a map and then
he<00:00:51.960> discovers<00:00:52.469> boom<00:00:53.100> cloud<00:00:53.699> cracker<00:00:54.059> prison

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
he discovers boom cloud cracker prison

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.840 
he discovers boom cloud cracker prison
so<00:00:55.230> this<00:00:55.410> looks<00:00:55.590> like<00:00:55.649> it's<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.010> actual<00:00:56.430> story

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.810 
and the second one perhaps is coming out
perhaps<00:02:11.620> when<00:02:11.770> the<00:02:11.860> game<00:02:12.040> comes<00:02:12.280> out<00:02:12.490> or<00:02:12.700> maybe

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
perhaps when the game comes out or maybe

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.190 
perhaps when the game comes out or maybe
right<00:02:13.030> before<00:02:13.420> that<00:02:13.600> perhaps<00:02:13.990> we'll<00:02:14.170> see

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
right before that perhaps we'll see

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.220 
right before that perhaps we'll see
maybe<00:02:14.530> some<00:02:14.770> new<00:02:14.950> trap<00:02:15.340> masters<00:02:15.910> if<00:02:16.810> it<00:02:17.020> comes

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
maybe some new trap masters if it comes

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.740 
maybe some new trap masters if it comes
out<00:02:17.410> before<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.890> game<00:02:18.130> now<00:02:18.850> a<00:02:18.880> cloud<00:02:19.270> cracker

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
out before the game now a cloud cracker

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.050 
out before the game now a cloud cracker
prison<00:02:20.350> looks<00:02:20.560> sweet<00:02:21.160> it's<00:02:21.430> kind<00:02:21.640> of<00:02:21.670> a<00:02:21.760> shame

get<00:02:25.180> to<00:02:25.450> explore<00:02:26.260> it<00:02:26.470> at<00:02:26.710> all<00:02:27.010> before<00:02:27.640> it's

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
get to explore it at all before it's

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.080 
get to explore it at all before it's
blown<00:02:28.510> to<00:02:28.720> pieces<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.890> now<00:02:30.070> also<00:02:30.550> in<00:02:30.820> the<00:02:30.910> back

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
blown to pieces and now also in the back

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
like a look at this here my one of my

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.540 
like a look at this here my one of my
favorites<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.290> guys<00:02:35.470> know<00:02:35.650> that<00:02:35.680> jawbreaker

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
pretty much says he's from a race of

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.570 
pretty much says he's from a race of
robots<00:02:39.610> that<00:02:40.560> operate<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.800> sky<00:02:42.130> train<00:02:42.550> I

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
robots that operate the sky train I

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.699 
robots that operate the sky train I
think<00:02:43.240> the<00:02:43.420> sky<00:02:43.720> train<00:02:44.020> is<00:02:44.200> gonna<00:02:44.290> be<00:02:44.560> in

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
think the sky train is gonna be in

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.860 
think the sky train is gonna be in
Skylanders<00:02:45.340> trap<00:02:45.520> team<00:02:46.000> because<00:02:46.660> there's

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
Skylanders trap team because there's

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.740

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
definitely a train level so maybe a

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.930 
definitely a train level so maybe a
jawbreaker<00:02:50.620> soul<00:02:51.010> gem<00:02:51.250> would<00:02:51.370> be<00:02:51.520> in<00:02:51.670> that

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
jawbreaker soul gem would be in that

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.300 
jawbreaker soul gem would be in that
level<00:02:52.270> who<00:02:52.870> knows<00:02:53.200> who<00:02:53.410> knows<00:02:53.440> can't<00:02:54.100> wait<00:02:54.220> to
