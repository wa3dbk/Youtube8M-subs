too familiar with Paul Frank like I said
earlier<00:02:34.950> but<00:02:35.160> I<00:02:35.400> think<00:02:35.910> overall<00:02:36.239> they've

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
earlier but I think overall they've

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.379 
earlier but I think overall they've
really<00:02:37.290> stepped<00:02:37.560> it<00:02:37.769> up<00:02:37.829> on<00:02:38.010> these<00:02:38.220> uh<00:02:38.389> little
