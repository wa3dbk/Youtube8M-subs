1000 * when we get over 250 que esperar
we<00:00:20.760> also<00:00:20.939> know<00:00:21.180> that<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.510> speedos<00:00:21.930> tend<00:00:22.260> to

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
we also know that the speedos tend to

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.320 
we also know that the speedos tend to
overeat<00:00:22.890> somewhat<00:00:23.400> on<00:00:23.640> Japanese<00:00:24.119> motorcycle

overeat somewhat on Japanese motorcycle

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.660 
overeat somewhat on Japanese motorcycle
so<00:00:24.990> we've<00:00:25.199> got<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.590> guys<00:00:25.740> from<00:00:26.010> Garmin<00:00:26.490> along

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
so we've got the guys from Garmin along

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.150 
so we've got the guys from Garmin along
and<00:00:26.880> they<00:00:26.970> going<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.359> bolt<00:00:27.570> azuma<00:00:28.289> onto<00:00:29.070> the

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
and they going to bolt azuma onto the

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.910 
and they going to bolt azuma onto the
front<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.699> back<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:30.570> get<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.720> genuine<00:00:31.560> top

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
front of the back to get a genuine top

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.870 
front of the back to get a genuine top
speed<00:00:32.340> reading<00:00:34.160> we<00:00:35.160> found<00:00:35.340> an<00:00:35.460> easy<00:00:35.579> place<00:00:35.850> to

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
speed reading we found an easy place to

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.940 
speed reading we found an easy place to
mount<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.300> on<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.450> left<00:00:36.690> hand<00:00:36.930> side<00:00:37.050> over<00:00:37.559> the

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
mount it on the left hand side over the

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.900 
mount it on the left hand side over the
handlebar

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.400 

well<00:00:44.910> very<00:00:45.089> second<00:00:45.480> us<00:00:45.570> then<00:00:45.780> all<00:00:46.019> of<00:00:46.140> two

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
well very second us then all of two

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.470 
well very second us then all of two
minutes<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.890> foot<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.339> old<00:00:47.579> garmin<00:00:48.030> here<00:00:48.239> and

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
minutes to foot the old garmin here and

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.840 
minutes to foot the old garmin here and
the<00:00:48.690> idea<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:48.989> for<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:50.129> measure<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.460> top<00:00:50.609> speed

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
the idea is for to measure the top speed

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.610 
the idea is for to measure the top speed
today<00:00:51.030> but<00:00:51.390> it's<00:00:52.019> so<00:00:52.199> simple<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.559> navigate

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
today but it's so simple to navigate

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.950 
today but it's so simple to navigate
there<00:00:53.159> just<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.550> see<00:00:54.000> where<00:00:54.210> i<00:00:54.239> am<00:00:54.479> once<00:00:54.780> it's

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
there just to see where i am once it's

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.840 
there just to see where i am once it's
set<00:00:55.109> up<00:00:55.140> in<00:00:55.379> two<00:00:55.469> kilometers<00:00:55.920> etc<00:00:56.309> yeah<00:00:56.519> once

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
set up in two kilometers etc yeah once

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.160 
set up in two kilometers etc yeah once
everything's<00:00:57.210> set<00:00:57.390> up<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.600> GPS<00:00:57.929> will<00:00:58.050> know

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
everything's set up the GPS will know

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.840 
everything's set up the GPS will know
exactly<00:00:58.260> where<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.890> are<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.309> because<00:00:59.699> it's

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
exactly where you are and because it's

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.759 
exactly where you are and because it's
in<00:00:59.909> constant<00:01:00.299> time<00:01:00.449> constant<00:01:01.260> connection

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
in constant time constant connection

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:03.259 
in constant time constant connection
with<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.070> satellite<00:01:02.369> you<00:01:02.940> will<00:01:03.059> have<00:01:03.149> the

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
with the satellite you will have the

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:05.570 
with the satellite you will have the
most<00:01:03.420> accurate<00:01:03.719> speed<00:01:04.259> which<00:01:04.769> were<00:01:05.220> no<00:01:05.430> matter

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
most accurate speed which were no matter

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.620 
most accurate speed which were no matter
what<00:01:05.820> speed<00:01:06.060> you're<00:01:06.180> traveling<00:01:06.450> if<00:01:06.539> you're

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
what speed you're traveling if you're

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.940 
what speed you're traveling if you're
flying<00:01:06.750> on<00:01:06.869> an<00:01:06.990> airplane<00:01:07.049> have<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.619> look<00:01:07.830> at

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
flying on an airplane have a look at

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.050 
flying on an airplane have a look at
your<00:01:08.070> GPS<00:01:08.369> it'll<00:01:08.580> give<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.820> an<00:01:08.939> accurate

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
your GPS it'll give you an accurate

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.999 
your GPS it'll give you an accurate
speed<00:01:09.539> and<00:01:09.720> that's<00:01:10.259> going<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.470> be<00:01:10.560> advantage

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009 
speed and that's going to be advantage

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:12.740 
speed and that's going to be advantage
today<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.640> it's<00:01:11.759> the<00:01:12.030> reason<00:01:12.060> why<00:01:12.360> we<00:01:12.479> Archer

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
today and it's the reason why we Archer

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.510 
today and it's the reason why we Archer
I'm<00:01:12.930> intrigued<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.590> way<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.830> does<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.100> it

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
I'm intrigued the way it does that it

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.160 
I'm intrigued the way it does that it
must<00:01:14.759> go<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.149> a<00:01:15.330> couple<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.750> satellites

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
must go to a couple of satellites

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.230 
must go to a couple of satellites
because<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.950> be<00:01:17.039> able<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.399> get<00:01:17.880> reference

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
because to be able to get reference

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.149 
because to be able to get reference
points<00:01:18.600> at<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:19.020> speed<00:01:19.319> now<00:01:19.740> it's<00:01:19.920> a

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
points at that speed now it's a

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.130 
points at that speed now it's a
12-channel<00:01:20.429> GPS<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.509> it's<00:01:21.630> Rick<00:01:21.780> it's<00:01:21.929> getting

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
12-channel GPS so it's Rick it's getting

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.600 
12-channel GPS so it's Rick it's getting
signals<00:01:22.679> from<00:01:22.740> whole<00:01:23.220> bunch<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.549> different

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
signals from whole bunch of different

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.889 
signals from whole bunch of different
satellites<00:01:24.000> bring<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.509> into<00:01:24.630> one

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
satellites bring it into one

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:26.840 
satellites bring it into one
triangulating<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.860> on<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.039> position<00:01:26.399> and<00:01:26.520> just

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
triangulating you on a position and just

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.789 
triangulating you on a position and just
tracking<00:01:27.149> you<00:01:27.330> as<00:01:27.360> you're<00:01:27.600> moving<00:01:27.690> they<00:01:28.619> are

tracking you as you're moving they are

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.260 
tracking you as you're moving they are
big<00:01:28.950> thing<00:01:29.100> today<00:01:29.280> obviously<00:01:29.429> top<00:01:29.789> speed<00:01:30.030> but

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
big thing today obviously top speed but

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.789 
big thing today obviously top speed but
