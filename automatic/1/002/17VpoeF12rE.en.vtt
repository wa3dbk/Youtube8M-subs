at<00:00:06.629> this<00:00:06.810> particular<00:00:07.109> stoplight<00:00:07.680> we<00:00:07.859> want<00:00:08.040> to

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
at this particular stoplight we want to

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.180 
at this particular stoplight we want to
make<00:00:08.250> a<00:00:08.280> left<00:00:08.519> turn<00:00:08.639> and<00:00:09.150> then<00:00:10.110> when<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:11.010> light

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
make a left turn and then when the light

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.919 
make a left turn and then when the light
turns<00:00:11.400> green<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:11.700> we<00:00:11.969> have<00:00:12.000> oncoming<00:00:12.599> traffic

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
turns green and we have oncoming traffic

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.930 
turns green and we have oncoming traffic
sometimes<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.799> applicant<00:00:14.280> doesn't<00:00:14.610> realize

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
sometimes the applicant doesn't realize

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.269 
sometimes the applicant doesn't realize
that<00:00:14.969> they<00:00:15.870> have<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.289> wait<00:00:16.619> for<00:00:16.830> oncoming

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
that they have to wait for oncoming

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.220 
that they have to wait for oncoming
traffic<00:00:17.580> before<00:00:17.910> they<00:00:18.210> can<00:00:18.390> make<00:00:18.869> their<00:00:19.020> left

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
traffic before they can make their left

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.410 
traffic before they can make their left
turn<00:00:19.500> if<00:00:20.400> they<00:00:20.580> have<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.730> green<00:00:20.939> protected

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
turn if they have a green protected

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.090 
turn if they have a green protected
arrow<00:00:21.600> then<00:00:21.930> they<00:00:22.320> know<00:00:22.470> that<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.769> car<00:00:22.949> that's

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
arrow then they know that the car that's

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.890 
arrow then they know that the car that's
coming<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.670> supposed<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.150> stop<00:00:24.390> so<00:00:24.660> when<00:00:24.779> they

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
coming is supposed to stop so when they

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
see a solid green light they think of

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.339 
see a solid green light they think of
the<00:00:27.150> rule<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.539> green<00:00:27.720> arrow<00:00:27.900> they<00:00:28.170> think

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
the rule of the green arrow they think

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.439 
the rule of the green arrow they think
okay<00:00:28.650> my<00:00:29.310> light<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.640> green<00:00:29.849> I'm<00:00:30.090> going<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.300> go

wait for the pedestrians to cross then

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.910

don't<00:00:52.920> worry<00:00:53.250> if<00:00:53.460> you're<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:53.820> the

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
don't worry if you're in the

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.930 
don't worry if you're in the
intersection<00:00:54.690> when<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.989> light<00:00:55.199> turns<00:00:55.590> red

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
intersection when the light turns red

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.060 
intersection when the light turns red
you've<00:00:56.940> entered<00:00:57.420> legally<00:00:58.020> on<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.260> green<00:00:58.770> light

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
you've entered legally on a green light

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.150 
you've entered legally on a green light
so<00:00:59.370> other<00:01:00.270> traffic<00:01:00.840> has<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.109> wait<00:01:01.440> for<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.920> to

so other traffic has to wait for you to

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.850 
so other traffic has to wait for you to
clear<00:01:02.550> before<00:01:02.910> they<00:01:03.329> can<00:01:03.629> proceed<00:01:04.049> some<00:01:04.710> of

clear before they can proceed some of

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.980 
clear before they can proceed some of
the<00:01:05.159> most<00:01:05.339> common<00:01:05.729> mistakes<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.630> test

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
the most common mistakes that that test

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.609 
the most common mistakes that that test
drive<00:01:07.439> test<00:01:07.619> applicants<00:01:08.130> make<00:01:09.619> crosswalks

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
drive test applicants make crosswalks

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.740 
drive test applicants make crosswalks
okay<00:01:11.130> when<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.210> come<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.479> an<00:01:12.540> intersection

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
okay when you come to an intersection

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.530 
okay when you come to an intersection
they<00:01:13.680> go<00:01:13.920> right<00:01:14.130> in<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.369> crosswalk<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:15.150> next

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
they go right in the crosswalk and next

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.880 
they go right in the crosswalk and next
thing<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.689> know<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:15.960> there's<00:01:16.439> two<00:01:16.710> three

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
thing you know you there's two three

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.800 
thing you know you there's two three
people<00:01:17.100> studying<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:18.119> know<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.479> on<00:01:18.659> the

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
people studying you know and on the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.270 
people studying you know and on the
point<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.140> wanting<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.409> cross<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:20.100> whole

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
point of wanting to cross the whole

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.219 
point of wanting to cross the whole
point<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.180> crosswalk<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.930> have<00:01:22.080> to

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
point of the crosswalk is you have to

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.679 
point of the crosswalk is you have to
stop<00:01:22.470> behind<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.979> line<00:01:23.159> then<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.270> check<00:01:24.479> for

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
stop behind the line then you check for

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.440 
stop behind the line then you check for
pedestrians<00:01:25.259> right<00:01:25.590> or<00:01:25.740> left<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:27.210> then

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
pedestrians right or left and and then

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.420 
pedestrians right or left and and then
if<00:01:27.540> there's<00:01:27.750> no<00:01:27.869> pedestrians<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:29.040> can<00:01:29.220> move

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
if there's no pedestrians you can move

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.640 
if there's no pedestrians you can move
up<00:01:29.610> into<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.150> crosswalk<00:01:30.390> out<00:01:30.810> for<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.170> so

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
up into the crosswalk out for that so

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.440 
up into the crosswalk out for that so
you<00:01:31.740> can<00:01:31.890> see<00:01:31.920> around<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.369> corner<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.299> you

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
you can see around the corner and you

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.999 
you can see around the corner and you
look<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.900> then<00:01:33.990> if<00:01:34.110> everything<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.470> good<00:01:34.710> to
