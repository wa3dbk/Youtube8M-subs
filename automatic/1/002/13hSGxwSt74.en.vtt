about<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:15.910> fact<00:02:16.120> that<00:02:16.300> last<00:02:16.989> minute<00:02:17.650> deals

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
about the fact that last minute deals

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.229 
about the fact that last minute deals
are<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.280> best<00:02:18.819> wait<00:02:19.810> for<00:02:20.050> the<00:02:20.140> last<00:02:20.380> minute

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.009 
now this is something that resorts and
destinations<00:02:24.400> airlines<00:02:24.880> don't<00:02:25.180> like<00:02:25.600> to<00:02:25.810> hear

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
wait for the last minute because they

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.039 
wait for the last minute because they
can't<00:02:27.880> plan<00:02:28.239> on<00:02:28.510> last<00:02:29.260> minute<00:02:29.560> deals<00:02:30.840> so<00:02:31.840> if

going to keep coming down and down it
makes<00:03:12.489> no<00:03:12.730> sense<00:03:12.760> for<00:03:13.090> an<00:03:13.269> airline<00:03:13.570> to<00:03:13.900> fly<00:03:13.930> a

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
makes no sense for an airline to fly a

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.440 
makes no sense for an airline to fly a
two<00:03:14.950> hundred<00:03:15.040> passenger<00:03:15.670> plane<00:03:15.940> with<00:03:16.120> 100
