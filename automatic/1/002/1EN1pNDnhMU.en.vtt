example<00:01:19.189> this<00:01:20.189> piece<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.580> corn<00:01:20.990> if<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.200> piece

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
example this piece of corn if this piece

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.230 
example this piece of corn if this piece
of<00:01:22.650> corn<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:23.040> sprayed<00:01:23.280> with<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.490> chemical<00:01:23.729> and

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
of corn is sprayed with a chemical and

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.730 
of corn is sprayed with a chemical and
the<00:01:24.299> caterpillar<00:01:24.750> goes<00:01:24.930> on<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.380> eats<00:01:25.590> it

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
the caterpillar goes on it it eats it

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.060 
the caterpillar goes on it it eats it
and<00:01:25.830> dies<00:01:26.990> that's<00:01:27.990> not<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.259> corn<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.829> want

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
and dies that's not the corn that I want

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.679 
and dies that's not the corn that I want
to<00:01:29.130> put<00:01:29.250> on<00:01:29.340> my<00:01:29.520> butt<00:01:29.700> in<00:01:29.850> my<00:01:29.880> bed<00:01:30.210> example

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
to put on my butt in my bed example

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.359 
to put on my butt in my bed example
right<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.680> difference<00:01:31.829> between<00:01:32.040> the

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
right so the difference between the

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.190 
right so the difference between the
caterpillar<00:01:32.909> which<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.240> this<00:01:33.420> big<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.810> me<00:01:33.990> is

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
caterpillar which is this big and me is

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.130 
caterpillar which is this big and me is
sighs<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:35.340> pesticides<00:01:36.270> accumulate<00:01:37.020> in<00:01:37.110> the

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
sighs so pesticides accumulate in the

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.920 
sighs so pesticides accumulate in the
fat<00:01:37.380> cells<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:38.310> it's<00:01:38.460> going<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.610> kill<00:01:38.850> me<00:01:39.060> it's

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
fat cells so it's going to kill me it's

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.600 
fat cells so it's going to kill me it's
