00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.400
 what there are many after this we are 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.400
 replacing 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.810
 the valve body 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.790
 here we have 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:38.200
 the doors that had shown yesterday 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.200
 that were damaged 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.870
 there you see all the burrs 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:56.620
 now from there to here we have 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.190
 and now the fully armed bomb is 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.190
 the rotor 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:11.080
 this is the pump ring and there are the 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.730
 paddles yesterday was not spinning 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.250
 Now he is already spinning with much 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.670
 ease because everything was replaced 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.670
 new 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.909
 the city of what 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.990
 so let's continue let's put it 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.990
 instead 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.760
 and we are setting it 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.760
 we help two tones two screws 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.240
 here we have 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:21.060
 midpoints in a corner that is the 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.550
 that is entered in addition to that here goes a 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.100
 tube type guide where between other screw 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.050
 and there you are entering 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.020
 once we enter the body of 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:36.840
 cells that we do so that 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:39.150
 do not run what is the packaging 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.770
 the packaging is running, we are going to 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.120
 have problems 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:47.170
 then from there 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.170
 let's continue 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.210
 we put the others 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.310
 so that they will realize how it is going to 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.910
 be armed and finished this 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.420
 transmission 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.810
 we are setting the cover that is 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.810
 is 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.310
 because of well settled we are going to 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:12.310
 select this screws 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.330
 we are going to put 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.330
 and we will continue 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:23.090
 a tip so you do not miss the 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.160
 Size in the position of the screws 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:30.510
 simply and simply 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.290
 they put them all and they go falling to the 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.150
 same height 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.770
 and they are falling to the same height 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:42.400
 then there is no loses of those screws 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:46.380
 we can not exchange them for example 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.380
 here we have a long screw 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:56.690
 so if we tried to put an other 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:04:00.830
 side the height would be too much anymore 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:02.940
 the rope matches that is only 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.130
 a tip 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.220
 mountain dance 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:11.000
 here it is more or less at the height of 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.000
 all the screws 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.829
 and those screws are very small they are 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:21.370
 very different to all these only 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:23.760
 as a support as a support for the 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.650
 transmission switch 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.980
 how they were explained when they were 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.800
 making the videos with these to see the 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:34.440
 transmission computer in what 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:37.129
 speed meets and she does not the 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:40.669
 board teaches your letters 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:42.999
 Well, this one I'm going to finish 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:42.999
 cover 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:50.119
 now they left me a little alone only 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:51.980
 I want to send greetings to all 

00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:54.410

 but they think they're going to learn 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:47.819
