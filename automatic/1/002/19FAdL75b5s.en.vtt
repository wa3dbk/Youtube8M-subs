00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.040
 hello very good to all welcome to 

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:06.260
 your house welcome to sandro were 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.149
 the eggs are becoming fashionable 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:10.250
 Most manufacturers have already released their 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.920
 activity meters in this case 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.960
 I played already presented the such go see one 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.230
 an activity meter but it's also 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.369
 something more a bracelet that is also your 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.369
 free humans 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.750
 let's start a section of the design 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.340
 of such go from one of huawei as 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.960
 we see in a fun with a yellow 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.270
 It is logically made of plastic 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.650
 it weighs practically nothing and has 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.350
 delighted the color palette the red 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.700
 green yellow white gray to see what 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.739
 we love that it is the user who has 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.449
 the power of decision we are going to go in 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.550
 one of the extremes and the truth that we 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:47.010
 has enchanted a detail in a finish 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.180
 metallic with the huawei logo the 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.989
 true that gives a touch a bit of 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.640
 difference 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.309
 at the other end we will find if 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.019
 we removed the lid a usb connection with 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.210
 which we will be able to load the 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:58.769
 device all right we're not going to 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.720
 have to resort to any kind of 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.729
 external charger something that is usually 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.710
 quite common in other types of eggs 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:06.210
 so that all a success on the part of 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.090
 web game we got the important part 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.890
 the screen an oled screen on which 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.510
 has a button with which we are going to 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.729
 show different information as per 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.860
 example the now let's also be able 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.770
 visualize in the steps that we have taken 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.570
 the calories that we have burned and even 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.970
 the quality of sleep we have had 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.740
 during the night that we are going to get to 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.329
 the most important part in the sign of 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.690
 differentiation of the tall bank respect 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:29.340
 to the 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.900
 different degrees is that through 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.940
 this button we will be able to withdraw the 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.160
 screen and as you can see we 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.840
 we found with a free hands the 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.640
 true with twist or a thing that 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.100
 we did not expect and that really 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.860
 provides real added value to the state 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.810
 they go from one of Huawei one of the aspects 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.520
 most important logically of this 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.140
 wearable of the big game way is 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.150
 no doubt the application as we are going to 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.670
 interpret all the information that we 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.100
 throws the activity meter in this 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.870
 case we have shown you the application the 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.930
 it really has a very nice interface 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.220
 and it was very usable as you can see from a 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.290
 bit of general interface what we 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.050
 offers is a bit divided into two parts 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.730
 on the one hand to the right a space 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.800
 intended for sleep to sleep quality 

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:13.170
 the times that we have woken up by 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.400
 example and to the left a series of 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.320
 data that refer to the 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.570
 physical activity on the one hand in the 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.760
 distance traveled exercise hour and 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.640
 the calories that we have burned in addition to 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.100
 this if we press in this circle we 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.570
 a series of graphs appear in this 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.840
 case with a time slot with are 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.550
 our peaks of maximum activity 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.960
 graphic calories and others from here 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.240
 we will be able to access different 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.940
 information with graphics also according to 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:42.130
 the day the week and the month 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.320
 in the same way to the right in the type 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.270
 of sleep we will also be able to 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.400
 some graphics can control a bit 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.230
 what is the quality while you rest 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.180
 good as you see these have been the 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.650
 performance specifications 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.970
 We have even seen the 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.620
 operation of the application in 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.390
 which we will be able to control and 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.430
 monitor all the information that 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:04.410
 pick up the high van as always 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.410
 We hope you enjoyed a greeting
