00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
when I think of glenn beck i think of

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.639 
when I think of glenn beck i think of
exactly<00:00:05.220> Abbie<00:00:05.670> Hoffman<00:00:05.970> I<00:00:06.390> had<00:00:07.080> the<00:00:07.230> exact

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649

same<00:00:07.799> feeling<00:00:08.400> towards<00:00:09.000> that<00:00:09.210> because<00:00:09.599> it

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
same feeling towards that because it

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.520 
same feeling towards that because it
seems<00:00:10.349> like<00:00:10.500> underneath<00:00:11.389> there<00:00:12.389> is<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:12.719> real

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
seems like underneath there is a real

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.029 
seems like underneath there is a real
political<00:00:14.280> agenda<00:00:15.030> there<00:00:15.809> is<00:00:15.990> real<00:00:16.410> emotion

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
political agenda there is real emotion

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.760 
political agenda there is real emotion
there<00:00:17.250> is<00:00:17.369> real<00:00:17.640> thought<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.029> then<00:00:18.990> while<00:00:19.529> it

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
there is real thought and then while it

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.769 
there is real thought and then while it
starts<00:00:20.130> happening<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.760> you<00:00:21.060> could<00:00:21.270> say<00:00:21.600> this

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
starts happening and you could say this

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.710 
starts happening and you could say this
as<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:21.990> negative<00:00:22.580> but<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:23.760> don't<00:00:24.150> think<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.510> is

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
as a negative but I don't think it is

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.560 
as a negative but I don't think it is

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.490 
validity and the irony is that you were
essentially<00:05:43.150> going<00:05:43.419> someplace<00:05:43.810> you<00:05:44.380> were

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
essentially going someplace you were

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.950 
essentially going someplace you were
preaching<00:05:44.800> not<00:05:45.340> to<00:05:45.639> the<00:05:45.729> choir<00:05:46.030> you<00:05:46.570> want<00:05:46.810> to

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
preaching not to the choir you want to

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.540 
preaching not to the choir you want to
speak<00:05:47.169> your<00:05:47.349> mind<00:05:47.590> to<00:05:47.919> an<00:05:48.039> audience<00:05:48.310> that's

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
speak your mind to an audience that's

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.520 
speak your mind to an audience that's
not<00:05:48.789> yours<00:05:49.060> which<00:05:49.630> is<00:05:49.750> essentially<00:05:50.289> what<00:05:50.320> The

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.530 
not yours which is essentially what The

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:52.110 
not yours which is essentially what The
Smothers<00:05:50.710> Brothers<00:05:50.919> did<00:05:51.400> on<00:05:51.520> prime<00:05:51.759> time<00:05:51.909> on

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
Smothers Brothers did on prime time on

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.360 
Smothers Brothers did on prime time on
CBS<00:05:52.380> those<00:05:53.380> are<00:05:53.560> the<00:05:53.590> points<00:05:53.949> I<00:05:54.009> was<00:05:54.130> kind<00:05:54.340> of

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
CBS those are the points I was kind of

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.399 
CBS those are the points I was kind of
yeah<00:05:54.729> yeah<00:05:55.300> and<00:05:55.570> I<00:05:55.599> for<00:05:55.930> screwed<00:05:56.199> up<00:05:56.289> the<00:05:56.380> whole

00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:56.409 
yeah yeah and I for screwed up the whole

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:58.529 
yeah yeah and I for screwed up the whole
thing<00:05:56.530> prevent<00:05:57.039> you've<00:05:58.030> been<00:05:58.150> set<00:05:58.419> in<00:05:58.509> that

00:05:58.529 --> 00:05:58.539 
thing prevent you've been set in that

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:02.300 
thing prevent you've been set in that
upper<00:05:58.780> 30<00:05:58.990> minutes<00:05:59.349> now

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.860 

I<00:06:03.310> believe<00:06:04.030> you'll<00:06:04.150> find<00:06:04.210> he'd<00:06:04.540> been<00:06:04.660> set<00:06:04.840> up

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
I believe you'll find he'd been set up

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.460 
I believe you'll find he'd been set up
for<00:06:04.990> about<00:06:05.230> three<00:06:05.470> years<00:06:05.770> now<00:06:07.200> and<00:06:08.200> that's

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470 
for about three years now and that's

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.160 
for about three years now and that's
what<00:06:08.590> i<00:06:08.710> mean<00:06:08.890> by<00:06:09.070> context<00:06:09.790> it<00:06:10.120> has<00:06:10.420> to<00:06:10.630> be<00:06:10.810> a

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:11.170 
what i mean by context it has to be a

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.680 
what i mean by context it has to be a
big-time<00:06:11.590> of<00:06:12.070> God<00:06:12.310> but<00:06:12.700> both<00:06:12.940> of<00:06:12.970> those<00:06:13.330> are

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:13.690 
big-time of God but both of those are

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.890 
big-time of God but both of those are
our<00:06:14.910> but<00:06:15.910> it<00:06:16.000> is<00:06:16.060> a<00:06:16.090> tricky<00:06:16.480> question<00:06:16.600> though

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
our but it is a tricky question though

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.020 
our but it is a tricky question though
because<00:06:17.020> you<00:06:17.200> also<00:06:17.380> you<00:06:17.590> also<00:06:17.620> did<00:06:18.310> a<00:06:18.340> video

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.030 
because you also you also did a video

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:21.900 
because you also you also did a video
blog<00:06:19.330> about<00:06:19.600> it<00:06:19.750> shortly<00:06:20.470> afterwards<00:06:20.920> where
