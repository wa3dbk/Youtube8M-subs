and leave the rest so we have kind of a

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.800 
and leave the rest so we have kind of a
hollow<00:01:16.770> trunk<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:18.090> then<00:01:18.270> I'm<00:01:18.420> gonna<00:01:18.540> try<00:01:18.750> to

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
hollow trunk and then I'm gonna try to

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.060 
hollow trunk and then I'm gonna try to
go<00:01:18.960> down<00:01:19.170> below<00:01:19.440> this<00:01:20.330> cut<00:01:21.330> area<00:01:21.540> here<00:01:22.070> and

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
go down below this cut area here and

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.490 
go down below this cut area here and
kind<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.340> make<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.490> little<00:01:23.610> window<00:01:24.030> in<00:01:24.180> there<00:01:24.500> so

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
kind of make a little window in there so

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.760 
kind of make a little window in there so
we<00:01:25.590> can<00:01:25.620> see<00:01:25.860> into<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.130> hollow<00:01:26.430> trunk<00:01:27.770> that's

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
we can see into that hollow trunk that's

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.070 
we can see into that hollow trunk that's
the<00:01:28.920> plan<00:01:31.610> no<00:01:32.610> I<00:01:33.060> don't<00:01:33.570> worry<00:01:33.690> about<00:01:33.780> that

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080

this<00:06:00.290> branch<00:06:00.590> might<00:06:00.830> die<00:06:01.040> the<00:06:01.100> bottom<00:06:01.550> part

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:01.790 
this branch might die the bottom part

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.470 
this branch might die the bottom part
