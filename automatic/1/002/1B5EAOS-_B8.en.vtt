00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.490
 hi i am emir and this is coffee with lyrics 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:11.830
 today he is going to talk to you about a very book 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.349
 special to me that is under the same 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:17.249
 star by jan wijn and he will tell you 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:17.249
 why I decided to read it 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.660
 I decided to read this book because it's going to 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.890
 leave the movie and I have to read 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.349
 the book before the movie always 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.040
 I feel very motivated by that as 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:36.470
 takes the movie out and if it's me 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.870
 push to read the book makes me be 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.790
 more interested as you already know and 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.260
 I kind of like they 're going around the 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.660
 book because I had the impression that 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.300
 it's going to be very sad but you can let go 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.879
 is going to tell you how my opinion changed and 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.129
 Well, if the story is about 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.850
 geyser bracey agostos waters heysel 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:59.239
 is 16 years old and august is 17 and hey 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:04.850
 sun has cancer August was but and 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:07.789
 like he was already healed and then jesus almost 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.580
 and he has no friends and then you could say 

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:11.570
 that his best friends are his parents 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.240
 then they stay at home 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.039
 watching television and their parents say 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.480
 one day that is that this is not a life 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:20.300
 for you 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:23.140
 and they invite her to come out more then the 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.260
 they put a support group where they attend 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:30.250
 people who have cancer 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:32.380
 and then it's going to be very much like forced and 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.740
 he meets a boy who is called 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.110
 I do this Suarez and he is very handsome and 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.300
 flirts with her and she is seeing him and 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.970
 they start talking and they do 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.800
 friends 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.750
 and they realize that they like it very much 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.880
 a good book rather geison you 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.260
 lend him and they both click with that 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.100
 book and they talk a lot about it 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.900
 and so that 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.350
 they say he has never been cured of cancer 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.990
 and that he has to take advantage of his days 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.030
 much that is very difficult to be cured and 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.950
 she has that mentality but it reaches 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.770
 this August, I kind of give a turn to 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.890
 his life because there is august is seriously is 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.600
 so cute 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.390
 like he understands very well so I am 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.340
 they make a click is not my character 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.650
 favorite was August is because it is very very 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.390
 cute and he's going to tell you a little bit 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.390
 of the author 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.870
 and 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.530
 to my outside or I liked it a lot because 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.959
 I think it's realistic but it's 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.749
 tender and I thought it's going to be very 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:51.260
 sad because it is cancer 

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:55.280
 but if the characters have to 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:58.819
 do but not something like that is not 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.280
 they do not talk to you so much cancer good 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.409
 they talk to you but it's not a book that 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.930
 make a book very sad to me 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:09.739
 it is very sad is that of the vice bones 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.840
 I made a review but this one 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.329
 laugh 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.540
 jan wijn makes you think a lot you put 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:20.329
 happy and sometimes you put on so much sad 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.769
 but you do not arrive like that I arrived 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:25.000
 There are many people who cry 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.000
 product I do not 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.050
 Well I kept quiet with these 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.920
 values ​​because it is very cute is very good 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.810
 and because this story is a date 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.830
 they appreciate more the things that you have in the 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:44.209
 life or health and that's how you put 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:46.099
 things in focus and I really liked this 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.349
 book the truth is the book that most 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.530
 liked wing well or does it make me that 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:54.680
 only one that I liked because 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:57.290
 looking for alaska and a good abundance 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.849
 duckling of the sun caterings that is not me 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.579
 they liked both for this book and that 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:03.590
 It's fine father and I really liked the 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:06.590
 only thing that I would give you is that 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.810
 I would have liked 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.180
 I would have liked history to have 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.700
 lasted longer because I liked it so much 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.030
 it was like I did not like one that already 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.090
 finished 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.190
 and if I had wanted I am lying down 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.460
 expand it because I loved it and they 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.260
 I promise good I hope so to be 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.630
 Aggressive that is not sad 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.540
 because this story has many parts 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.580
 where you laugh and then if you wear a little 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.070
 sad it's worth it because it's very good 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:38.970
