00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:16.610
 hello everyone we meet in 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.300
 Luque Island is a new modality of 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:22.820
 it's been kubica games and basically 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.770
 they are sky wars but the chests come out 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.509
 random things like here is to have 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.910
 luck you can basically do things 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:30.590
 very bad or good things we are playing 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.680
 what and really cool I've been 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.050
 getting more or less the idea of ​​how 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.809
 goes the game for example this bar what 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.680
 that shoots is how we're going to try it 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:44.540
 for example - there's the whole game 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.000
 and then it recharges as we are 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.769
 wait 26 seconds to recharge and you 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.479
 can play very good things or very 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:51.739
 bad really it's really cool to get me 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:53.239
 you think mobility and if you want more 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.339
 through the channel everything thought to upload it with 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.040
 more youtubers walesa more for or also 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:59.780
 because he shot me I do not know how good but 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.820
 not late enough I felt a 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.739
 little bit down the voices for that very reason 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.690
 because I'm recording in my case he sleeps 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.880
 people like anybody go 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.409
 ok this one wants to pierre then with 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.620
 this one he played looks for some good 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.900
 but I 'm sorry they throw you down 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.300
 ok he has known all the blocks and I 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.850
 has touched for example a block of 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.490
 iron so free to see well treat 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:25.410
 your day over here to remove the block 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.410
 iron from here I take it I think 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.980
 by perfect here but I iron it 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.210
 it's something iron worth meters clothes already 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.760
 ok now I can use this again 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.530
 as it is around here and if I see that I do not have 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.990

 for wanting as he lets me shoot tnt 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.310
