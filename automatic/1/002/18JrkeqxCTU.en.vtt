doing this for the sake of God that

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.460 
doing this for the sake of God that

things for God's sake only not for any
other<00:04:45.930> reason<00:04:46.229> is<00:04:47.040> a<00:04:47.100> very<00:04:47.400> important<00:04:47.850> value

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
other reason is a very important value

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.030 
other reason is a very important value
and<00:04:48.300> perhaps<00:04:48.479> that's<00:04:49.200> one<00:04:49.410> of<00:04:49.560> the<00:04:49.680> reasons

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
and perhaps that's one of the reasons

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.940 
and perhaps that's one of the reasons
why<00:04:50.190> God<00:04:50.490> in<00:04:50.760> the<00:04:51.180> early<00:04:51.419> days<00:04:51.570> of<00:04:51.720> Mecca<00:04:52.050> when
