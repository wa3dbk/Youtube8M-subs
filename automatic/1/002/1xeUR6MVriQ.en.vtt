all right so unfortunately no three
hollows<00:02:34.600> out<00:02:34.690> of<00:02:34.810> three<00:02:35.020> packs<00:02:35.260> but<00:02:35.620> that's

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
hollows out of three packs but that's

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.620 
hollows out of three packs but that's
okay<00:02:36.430> I<00:02:36.460> think<00:02:36.610> we've<00:02:36.820> already<00:02:37.090> done<00:02:37.390> pretty

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
okay I think we've already done pretty

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.900 
okay I think we've already done pretty
good<00:02:37.780> with<00:02:37.960> our<00:02:38.110> odds<00:02:38.320> even<00:02:38.710> if<00:02:39.520> we<00:02:39.610> don't<00:02:39.760> pull

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
good with our odds even if we don't pull

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.960 
good with our odds even if we don't pull
another<00:02:40.150> holographic<00:02:40.780> are<00:02:40.990> two<00:02:41.830> out<00:02:42.160> of<00:02:42.190> six

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
another holographic are two out of six

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.670 
another holographic are two out of six
packs<00:02:43.210> is<00:02:43.450> actually<00:02:43.870> extremely<00:02:44.080> good<00:02:44.500> odds

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
packs is actually extremely good odds

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.320 
packs is actually extremely good odds
because<00:02:44.920> that's<00:02:45.160> one<00:02:45.790> out<00:02:45.820> of<00:02:45.940> every<00:02:46.210> three

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
because that's one out of every three

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.170 
because that's one out of every three
that<00:02:46.750> you're<00:02:46.840> technically<00:02:47.170> pulling<00:02:47.590> and<00:02:48.180> that

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
that you're technically pulling and that

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.500 
that you're technically pulling and that
was<00:02:49.300> the<00:02:49.420> rare<00:02:49.600> and<00:02:50.410> let's<00:02:51.100> see<00:02:51.220> oh<00:02:51.420> just<00:02:52.420> a

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
was the rare and let's see oh just a

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.640 
was the rare and let's see oh just a
rare<00:02:52.720> out<00:02:52.870> of<00:02:52.990> this<00:02:53.140> one<00:02:53.380> as<00:02:53.590> well<00:02:54.390> all<00:02:55.390> right

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
rare out of this one as well all right

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.160 
rare out of this one as well all right
let's<00:02:56.650> see<00:02:56.800> two<00:02:57.100> packs<00:02:57.370> left<00:02:57.880> to<00:02:58.060> go<00:02:58.270> with<00:02:58.960> any

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
let's see two packs left to go with any

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.050 
let's see two packs left to go with any
luck<00:02:59.410> hopefully<00:03:00.190> we<00:03:00.460> should<00:03:00.520> be<00:03:00.670> able<00:03:00.760> to<00:03:00.880> pool

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
luck hopefully we should be able to pool

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.630 
luck hopefully we should be able to pool
maybe<00:03:01.780> one<00:03:02.170> more<00:03:02.350> holographic<00:03:02.950> hard<00:03:03.160> let's

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
maybe one more holographic hard let's

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.950 
maybe one more holographic hard let's
see<00:03:03.790> if<00:03:03.850> we<00:03:03.970> can<00:03:04.060> get<00:03:04.180> something<00:03:04.450> really<00:03:04.780> good

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
see if we can get something really good

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.380 
see if we can get something really good
maybe<00:03:05.170> like<00:03:05.350> an<00:03:05.470> ultra<00:03:05.920> an<00:03:06.490> ultimate<00:03:07.090> or<00:03:07.330> a

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.020 
so in the comments section down below

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.720 
so in the comments section down below
remember<00:04:08.440> to<00:04:08.530> let<00:04:08.590> me<00:04:08.710> know<00:04:08.830> how<00:04:09.040> you<00:04:09.100> think<00:04:09.280> I

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
remember to let me know how you think I

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.760 
remember to let me know how you think I
did<00:04:10.060> out<00:04:10.270> of<00:04:10.300> my<00:04:10.510> pools<00:04:10.780> and<00:04:11.110> I<00:04:11.410> guess<00:04:11.590> that's

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
did out of my pools and I guess that's

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:20.280 
did out of my pools and I guess that's
it<00:04:11.860> for<00:04:12.040> now<00:04:12.160> this<00:04:12.459> is<00:04:12.580> glad<00:04:12.790> to<00:04:12.910> God<00:04:13.060> out
