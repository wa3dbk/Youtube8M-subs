are<00:00:41.510> converted<00:00:42.020> inside<00:00:42.440> the<00:00:42.590> pedals<00:00:42.980> so

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
are converted inside the pedals so

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.950 
are converted inside the pedals so
there's<00:00:43.280> no<00:00:43.430> need<00:00:43.640> for<00:00:43.820> a<00:00:43.850> bulky<00:00:44.059> power<00:00:44.480> supply

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.150 
a nine volt power supply would do just

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.570 
a nine volt power supply would do just
fine<00:00:47.379> this<00:00:48.379> pedal<00:00:48.739> could<00:00:48.860> run<00:00:49.010> on<00:00:49.160> batteries

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:49.580 
fine this pedal could run on batteries

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.340 
fine this pedal could run on batteries
and<00:00:49.730> get<00:00:49.820> up<00:00:49.940> to<00:00:50.059> six<00:00:50.269> hours<00:00:50.570> of<00:00:50.720> battery<00:00:50.870> life

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.480 

can<00:01:08.750> hit<00:01:09.020> the<00:01:09.140> gain<00:01:09.350> up<00:01:09.560> for<00:01:09.799> more<00:01:09.920> classic

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
can hit the gain up for more classic

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:21.690

it's very musical having the tube in the
pedal<00:01:24.640> I<00:01:24.700> can<00:01:24.850> treat<00:01:25.000> it<00:01:25.060> more<00:01:25.270> like<00:01:25.360> the<00:01:25.540> front

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
pedal I can treat it more like the front

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
end of an amp where I could lower my

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.780 
end of an amp where I could lower my
volume<00:01:27.640> and<00:01:28.090> change<00:01:29.130> controls<00:01:30.130> in<00:01:30.399> terms<00:01:30.610> of

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
volume and change controls in terms of

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.700 
volume and change controls in terms of
pickups<00:01:31.180> and<00:01:31.330> so<00:01:31.479> forth<00:01:31.780> and<00:01:31.960> clean<00:01:32.439> it<00:01:32.590> up

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
pickups and so forth and clean it up

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:42.719 
pickups and so forth and clean it up
while<00:01:33.009> it's<00:01:33.220> still<00:01:33.460> on

without<00:01:43.240> actually<00:01:43.720> touching<00:01:43.900> the<00:01:44.229> pedal<00:01:44.439> just

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
without actually touching the pedal just

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
turning the my guitars volume up I got

00:01:46.810 --> 00:02:00.270 
turning the my guitars volume up I got
all<00:01:46.960> this<00:01:47.080> hair<00:01:47.140> underneath<00:01:48.070> that

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.730 

now<00:02:01.280> think<00:02:01.580> of<00:02:01.700> this<00:02:01.850> more<00:02:02.180> like<00:02:02.360> a<00:02:02.740> darker

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
now think of this more like a darker
