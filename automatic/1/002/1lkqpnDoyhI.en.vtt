00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 hello everyone so here is a 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:16.139
 super bleach chapter that came out 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:17.400
 or finally fire at last finally I 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.000
 did not want to do that I had to 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.920
 do something 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:28.849
 frankly finally finally finally finally 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:32.610
 Finally finally finally finally finally we to 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:34.829
 jo guillaume after stokes a loan a 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.340
 kind of fork doing cocksucker 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.410
 in not how many chapters 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:44.070
 finally we see crime giova the guy he 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.370
 finally arrives and even him precisely even 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.219
 he is there in fesci mode I have 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.750
 heard for three hours no finally he 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.980
 is there anything good then that a great 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.510
 part of the chapter is quite a bit 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.530
 monotonous and frankly I would have liked 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.550
 see the next one because it's okay 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.800
 obviously that things helped me 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.100
 to be interesting and we fall a little 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.110
 in the mini bitche syndrome it's up to 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.580
 say there is in blitz ya more than 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.840
 chapters or to prepare things 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.159
 that for action to man can finally 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.659
 it's a bit boring brief at the beginning of 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.590
 chapter series and is missing you a little 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.430
 for the moment immobile view that has 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.630
 took the size of the last I was 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.369
 monitor in the previous chapter 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.270
 and the guy he's a bit because of 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.979
 anyway not move so I have 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.479
 still locked up hockey and right now 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.470
 the obviously the other shing friends 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.580
 Quincy adults are trying to 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.990
 center help each other to be able to 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.299
 reach the dimension of real power 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.030
 ass fucked king king declines 6 aliases 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.880
 is the new word dignity alias playing 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.290
 bach and now we have a little back 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.490
 on ichigo so with his pals who 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.689
 had fallen so from the king's palace and 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.340
 who fell in the base city go 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.470
 call it like that and precisely this fact 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.390
 do not wake up read richie and others who 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.829
 precisely are andre parrat again 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.909
 returned there aliotti I had forgotten 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.899
 that he had lost an arm or it was 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.850
 of his branches his feathers in any case 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.710
 was treated with rice but we had 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.619
 a quick return of conway football 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.240
 of crohn please me orient it good it was 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.950
 nice at first to reintroduce but 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.899
 that's how it represents a little long 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.159
 cinépop bleach and gels well along 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.790
 if a time since the problem 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.590
 we are now in the 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.820
 new era of goal at home 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.320
 at the time of bleach there are better 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.850
 stuff that in the old days of 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.619
 bleach so suddenly as for me from 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.720
 that a relic of the past only to each 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.280
 reminds me of them again how much 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.599
 bleach was cool before and that's why 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.280
 that it annoys me a little to see but 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.720
 blow this chapter also once again 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.370
 is very slow is a French chapter 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.019
 that allows us to approach things 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.700
 even more interesting that are going 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.500
 soon to arrive which precisely during 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.420
 around jinzhou so why 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.160
 the author introduces us crime day I 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.040
 reminds that greene joe at a higher level 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.680
 or less similar go go we're going 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.260
 to say of equal strength with ichigo with his 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.150
 hollow mask a gain shaped jones 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.730
 then release here obviously on power 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.930
 up can not be too abused 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.510
 so that means maybe he has the 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.420
 strength of the number 2 or maybe the palace 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.560
 big max maybe go the strength of 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.690
 walker loves to go anyway 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.040
 good go if east of France the 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.090
 to cook in free form and that is even 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:59.760
 stronger than the barragan or finally 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:02.519
 that espada number number one the primo 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.680
 more but is not it here and now 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.329
 I may say that it can be 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.340
 useful but at the same time I mean me 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:11.130
 malbaie the child free me it's done 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.930
 ass fucked as long as why is it 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.220
 green jobs itself is spreading old quay 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.540
 many come never seen but 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.560
 frankly he was very kidney 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.359
 currently he is being overtaken 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.500
 outclassed by a lot of people so 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:21.510
 why is there now 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.609
 nothing under his coming would make a difference 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.109
 not because inevitably his coming to do 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.430
 a dance and a hollow and more than 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.109
 100 votes he gets to open a kind 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.730
 of gargantua inside the 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:31.049
 dimension of the king a fucking thing but the 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.190
 others we would not be able to do then 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.260
 how is it that he gets to 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.269
 do that maybe the guy masters 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.250
 as of Sunday or no I do not know in 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.989
 anyway I really hope that while 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.970
 greene joe a little europe and a trick a 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.290
 little more an ace and we will say consistent 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.940
 not a shit thing that made him 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.410
 allows to match someone who knows in q 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.359
 just fucked by the seller h 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.919
 so that's when I said this video 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:51.450
 stops at his ribs unfortunately 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:52.440
 as the content of this chapter we have it 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.359
 thankfully but I'm waiting mostly 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.120
 especially especially especially especially of this 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:58.319
 seal to see right before the sequel 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.970
 by the way now that I think about it 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.290
 maybe green jobs has developed a 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.150
 so for rob similar to cures to 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.769
 because grimmjow he may have had a 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.720
 he has a resurrection but maybe 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.459
 that there is a second as precisely where 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.190
 the killer has that makes it possible to rise to 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.020
 even third but of it 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.430
 precisely a higher stage of evolution 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.540
 short all the people all the fans of 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.570
 bilic who did not expect it necessarily 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.130
 screaming eva and I am 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.440
 personally being lounge 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.330
 in the arm of the coup à g chapter 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.620
 only for his hunger is in the center of 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.480
 the roger scene prover the audience 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.530
 give me your opinion is shared the 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.600
 video if you know of new 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.340
 bleach fans because bleach before 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.630
 everything is a former top 3 is 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.520
 fool level quality but it remains 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.080
 still super chapter my sense 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.520
 only thanks to green jo short on 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.610
