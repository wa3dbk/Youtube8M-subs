00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.990
 400 grams of chicken breast for 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:25.640
 We have split into thin strips 50 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.640
 grams of parmesan cheese 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:33.510
 a liter 300 of broth as you can see 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:38.300
 we have there in the shell 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:41.240
 125 grams of butter 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:45.170
 one onion 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:47.590
 a glass of white wine coloring 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.590
 food 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:56.620
 salt pepper and some parsley these 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.560
 are all the ingredients that are going to 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.329
 need for our solved of 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.689
 chicken 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:07.860
 now we throw a third more or less a 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:07.860
 third of the butter 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:29.500
 it will melt very quickly and when the 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:32.789
 let's have melted, we'll add the onion 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.789
 that we already have it chopped 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.110
 and we have it and now we add 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.130
 the ceremony 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.130
 until it was noticed 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.430
 there we have the onion and now we add 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.430
 the chicken 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.630
 let's go around 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.650
 until the color 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.159
 and this color is removed after what 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.159
 have now 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:45.160
 the chicken has already caught some color 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.160
 and now we add the rice 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.819
 we were mixing 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.480
 until the rice is a bit left 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.480
 transparent 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.680
 Now let's add a little salt 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.090
 Now we have 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.830
 in coloring and pepper 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.870
 food coloring 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.770
 a little bit of freshly ground pepper 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:56.280
 mix a little and add the glass 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.280
 of white wine 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.320
 good here we have it and as you see here 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:26.050
 we have the broth the broth is already very 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.050
 hot and we will be adding 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:36.460
 we hear a case we are removing 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.740
 and the rice will go slowly absorbing 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:42.150
 the broth 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.150
 as soon as we see what 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.170
 but it is absorbing we add another 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:59.850
 there we have and we keep mixing 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.850
 We will go little by little paying attention to the saucepan 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.180
 now until I absorb everything 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.180
 mayor 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:22.769
 there we go adding more little broth to 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:24.569
 little and as you can see the rice is already 

00:05:22.769 --> 00:05:27.080
 hydrating 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:30.330
 which is catching 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:33.629
 is absorbing all the broth 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.810
 We will go like this little by little adding case to 

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:35.810
 case 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:43.030
 until adding all the broth that we 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:43.030
 It will take a total of about 20 minutes 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.720
 well, we have already removed it from 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:02.300
 fire you can see the texture it has 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:05.420
 as absorbed all the broth and now 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:08.140
 we add the rest of the butter that 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.140
 we had booked 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:18.200
 we ended up mixing 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:21.640
 so that with the heat of the rice 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.640
 is melting 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:38.630
 and we're going to move it a couple of 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.630
 minutes 

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:45.889
 and when the butter has melted 

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:45.889
 we will add the cheese 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:54.000
 butter has already melted well and 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:54.000
 now finally we add the cheese 

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:04.789
 and that we do the same operation 

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.780
 we mix everything that integrates well 

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:29.040
 and we have it and finally 

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:35.470
 we add 

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:35.470
 the parsley 

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.590
 you can heal 

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:50.580
 and we go straight to the table 

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:52.140
 you already see a fabulous dish and following 

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:55.860
 the steps that we have given very easy to 

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:56.660
 do I hope you liked it and up 

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:59.660
 the next 

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.660
 goodbye
