00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
light a fire up on his ass but I guess

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.390 
light a fire up on his ass but I guess
we're<00:01:30.810> real<00:01:31.200> reason<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:31.799> I'm<00:01:32.040> making<00:01:32.340> a

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
we're real reason that I'm making a

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.319 
we're real reason that I'm making a
video<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:34.280> fire<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.400> up<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.640> bluebe<00:01:35.939> so

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
video is to fire it up the bluebe so

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.789 
video is to fire it up the bluebe so
let's<00:01:37.020> get<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:39.259> all<00:01:40.259> right<00:01:40.320> well<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.619> had

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.600 

basically<00:02:06.990> some<00:02:07.170> gas<00:02:07.380> coming<00:02:08.100> out<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.490> it's

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
basically some gas coming out of it it's

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.770 
basically some gas coming out of it it's
a<00:02:08.670> little<00:02:08.759> wet<00:02:09.060> pretty<00:02:09.660> much<00:02:09.840> everywhere<00:02:11.780> and

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
a little wet pretty much everywhere and

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.340 
a little wet pretty much everywhere and
as<00:02:13.170> you<00:02:13.350> can<00:02:13.410> see<00:02:13.470> it's<00:02:14.370> kind<00:02:14.610> of<00:02:15.110> kind<00:02:16.110> of<00:02:16.170> wet

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
as you can see it's kind of kind of wet

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.440 
as you can see it's kind of kind of wet
all<00:02:17.100> over<00:02:17.130> here<00:02:17.550> by<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.730> carburetor<00:02:18.180> so<00:02:18.420> I

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
all over here by the carburetor so I

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.640 
all over here by the carburetor so I
think<00:02:18.600> I<00:02:19.160> think<00:02:20.160> I<00:02:20.520> may<00:02:20.670> be<00:02:20.700> leaking<00:02:21.180> a<00:02:21.240> bit<00:02:21.650> so

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
think I think I may be leaking a bit so

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.650 
think I think I may be leaking a bit so
eventually<00:02:23.489> it's<00:02:23.880> gonna<00:02:24.000> have<00:02:24.209> to<00:02:24.300> get<00:02:24.420> fixed

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
eventually it's gonna have to get fixed

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.470 
eventually it's gonna have to get fixed
but<00:02:24.959> I<00:02:25.230> got<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.010> fix<00:02:26.190> to<00:02:26.310> choke<00:02:26.520> anyway<00:02:26.880> because

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
but I got a fix to choke anyway because

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.780 
but I got a fix to choke anyway because
when<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:27.900> hit<00:02:28.050> the<00:02:28.340> when<00:02:29.340> you<00:02:29.430> hit<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:29.640> gas

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
when you hit the when you hit the gas

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.640 
when you hit the when you hit the gas
all<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.450> way<00:02:30.540> to<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:30.660> floor<00:02:30.810> this<00:02:31.290> choke

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
all the way to the floor this choke

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.160 
all the way to the floor this choke
should<00:02:31.890> basically<00:02:32.670> plop<00:02:33.209> back<00:02:33.480> but<00:02:34.050> it

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
should basically plop back but it

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.400 
should basically plop back but it
doesn't<00:02:34.560> you<00:02:34.950> have<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.190> reach<00:02:35.340> under<00:02:35.700> as

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
doesn't you have to reach under as

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.280 
doesn't you have to reach under as
you're<00:02:37.760> as<00:02:38.760> you're<00:02:39.300> pushing<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.959> throttle

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
you're as you're pushing the throttle

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.750 
you're as you're pushing the throttle
and<00:02:40.709> see<00:02:41.670> if<00:02:41.730> I<00:02:41.820> can<00:02:41.910> do<00:02:41.970> this<00:02:42.120> with<00:02:42.300> one<00:02:42.510> hand

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
and see if I can do this with one hand

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.840 
and see if I can do this with one hand
reach<00:02:44.760> in<00:02:45.470> and<00:02:46.470> push<00:02:46.769> up<00:02:46.980> on<00:02:47.130> this<00:02:47.310> side<00:02:47.580> and

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
reach in and push up on this side and

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.710 
reach in and push up on this side and
then<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.480> choke<00:02:49.080> close<00:02:49.350> it<00:02:49.640> so<00:02:50.720> that

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
then the choke close it so that

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.850 
then the choke close it so that
carburetor<00:02:52.019> is<00:02:52.200> gonna<00:02:52.320> have<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.530> get<00:02:52.680> gone

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
carburetor is gonna have to get gone

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.699 
carburetor is gonna have to get gone
through<00:02:53.100> one<00:02:53.220> of<00:02:53.250> these<00:02:53.400> days<00:02:53.670> but<00:02:54.470> it's<00:02:55.470> kind

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
through one of these days but it's kind

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.740 
through one of these days but it's kind
of<00:02:55.830> lower<00:02:56.220> on<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.550> list<00:02:56.730> because<00:02:57.150> it<00:02:57.510> still

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
of lower on the list because it still

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.660 
of lower on the list because it still
has<00:02:57.959> that<00:02:59.269> that<00:03:00.500> valve<00:03:01.500> problem<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:02.370> it's<00:03:02.519> not

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
has that that valve problem and it's not

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.140 
has that that valve problem and it's not
running<00:03:02.820> on<00:03:03.120> all<00:03:03.620> all<00:03:04.620> eight<00:03:04.950> at<00:03:05.820> least<00:03:05.970> not

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
running on all all eight at least not

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.509 
running on all all eight at least not
all<00:03:06.299> the<00:03:06.420> time<00:03:06.630> I<00:03:06.980> can<00:03:07.980> see<00:03:08.100> a<00:03:08.130> little<00:03:08.340> bit<00:03:08.430> of

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
all the time I can see a little bit of

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.410 
all the time I can see a little bit of
oil<00:03:08.610> down<00:03:09.360> there<00:03:09.420> in<00:03:09.630> the<00:03:09.690> valley<00:03:10.940> and<00:03:11.940> you<00:03:12.209> can

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
oil down there in the valley and you can

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.020 
oil down there in the valley and you can
from<00:03:12.630> somewhere<00:03:13.019> like<00:03:13.140> that<00:03:13.730> but<00:03:14.730> I'll<00:03:14.880> have

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
from somewhere like that but I'll have

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.660 
from somewhere like that but I'll have
to<00:03:15.060> clean<00:03:15.299> all<00:03:15.450> they<00:03:15.570> don't<00:03:15.690> put<00:03:15.930> into<00:03:16.110> it<00:03:16.670> one

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
to clean all they don't put into it one

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.350 
to clean all they don't put into it one
of<00:03:17.790> these<00:03:17.880> days<00:03:18.000> for<00:03:18.930> now<00:03:19.940> still<00:03:20.940> runs<00:03:21.150> pretty

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
of these days for now still runs pretty

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.510 
of these days for now still runs pretty
good

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
good

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:30.839 
good
considering<00:03:23.860> ya<00:03:24.860> pump<00:03:25.400> it<00:03:25.520> a<00:03:25.580> couple<00:03:25.760> of<00:03:25.850> times

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:34.949 

and<00:03:31.390> it<00:03:31.510> runs<00:03:32.310> cold<00:03:33.310> light<00:03:33.519> on<00:03:33.719> now<00:03:34.719> you<00:03:34.840> can

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
and it runs cold light on now you can

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.530 
and it runs cold light on now you can
hear<00:03:35.079> that

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
hear that

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.839 
hear that
kind<00:03:37.050> of<00:03:37.140> that<00:03:37.550> popping<00:03:38.550> noise<00:03:38.580> that's<00:03:40.849> a

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
kind of that popping noise that's a

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:45.430 
kind of that popping noise that's a
combination<00:03:42.360> of<00:03:42.989> an<00:03:43.319> exhaust<00:03:43.709> leak<00:03:43.940> and<00:03:44.940> that

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
combination of an exhaust leak and that

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.250 
combination of an exhaust leak and that
that<00:03:46.440> valve<00:03:46.769> is<00:03:47.010> rung<00:03:47.280> a<00:03:47.310> bit<00:03:47.519> rough<00:03:47.760> on<00:03:48.260> it

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
that valve is rung a bit rough on it

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.280 
that valve is rung a bit rough on it
believe<00:03:49.910> cylinder<00:03:50.910> number<00:03:51.060> seven<00:03:51.480> all<00:03:52.170> you

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
believe cylinder number seven all you

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.650 
believe cylinder number seven all you
remember<00:03:54.560> done<00:03:55.560> on<00:03:56.310> this<00:03:56.550> head<00:03:56.819> anyway<00:03:57.209> in<00:03:57.569> the

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
remember done on this head anyway in the

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.539 
remember done on this head anyway in the
back<00:04:00.319> I've<00:04:01.319> got<00:04:01.349> an<00:04:01.620> exhaust<00:04:01.980> leak<00:04:02.190> right

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
back I've got an exhaust leak right

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:08.820 
back I've got an exhaust leak right
there<00:04:02.610> I<00:04:03.120> can<00:04:03.390> actually<00:04:03.510> feel<00:04:03.870> it<00:04:04.110> get<00:04:04.680> worse

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.560 

protoss<00:04:09.550> in<00:04:09.820> the<00:04:09.880> back<00:04:10.680> should<00:04:11.680> be<00:04:11.740> one<00:04:12.360> way<00:04:13.360> in

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
protoss in the back should be one way in

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.810 
protoss in the back should be one way in
the<00:04:13.600> back<00:04:13.900> there<00:04:15.810> and<00:04:17.370> what<00:04:18.370> that's<00:04:18.580> done<00:04:18.760> is

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
the back there and what that's done is

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.020 
the back there and what that's done is
it's<00:04:19.120> allowed<00:04:19.390> the<00:04:20.400> manifolds<00:04:21.400> that<00:04:21.550> sort<00:04:21.970> of

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
it's allowed the manifolds that sort of

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.660 
it's allowed the manifolds that sort of
warp<00:04:22.410> and<00:04:23.410> come<00:04:23.620> back<00:04:23.800> and<00:04:24.070> come<00:04:24.160> off<00:04:24.340> of<00:04:24.550> that

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:24.670 
warp and come back and come off of that

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.250 
warp and come back and come off of that
and<00:04:25.350> that's<00:04:26.350> it<00:04:26.590> leave<00:04:26.770> so

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
and that's it leave so

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.800 
and that's it leave so
that'll<00:04:28.920> be<00:04:29.010> something<00:04:29.610> I<00:04:29.640> got<00:04:29.820> fixed<00:04:30.180> when<00:04:30.750> I

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
that'll be something I got fixed when I

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.010 
that'll be something I got fixed when I
get<00:04:30.960> the<00:04:31.080> head<00:04:31.230> off<00:04:31.260> when<00:04:31.620> I<00:04:31.680> do<00:04:31.830> that<00:04:31.950> valve

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
get the head off when I do that valve

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:41.200 
get the head off when I do that valve
got<00:04:34.620> bad<00:04:34.910> still
