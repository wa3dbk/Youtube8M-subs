doing one thing you don't feel that you
were<00:00:19.289> using<00:00:19.859> both<00:00:20.340> of<00:00:20.730> your<00:00:21.150> hands<00:00:21.680> what<00:00:22.680> does

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
were using both of your hands what does

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.660 
were using both of your hands what does
it<00:00:23.039> mean<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:24.090> have<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.420> sync<00:00:24.779> them<00:00:25.140> together

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
it mean you have to sync them together

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.700 
it mean you have to sync them together
you<00:00:26.670> have<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.060> connect<00:00:27.539> them<00:00:27.779> into<00:00:28.260> one

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
you have to connect them into one

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.330 
you have to connect them into one
thought<00:00:29.250> one<00:00:29.970> motion<00:00:30.480> for<00:00:31.349> example<00:00:31.439> when<00:00:32.250> you

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
thought one motion for example when you

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.510 
thought one motion for example when you
think<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:33.350> when<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.440> try<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.649> think<00:00:35.070> two

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
think to when you try to think two

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.840 
think to when you try to think two
thoughts<00:00:36.120> together<00:00:37.219> try<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.280> do<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.670> for

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
thoughts together try to do it for

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.380 
thoughts together try to do it for
instance<00:00:39.149> for<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.480> second<00:00:41.059> it's<00:00:42.059> very

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
instance for a second it's very

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.880 
instance for a second it's very
difficult<00:00:43.050> or<00:00:43.440> it's<00:00:43.950> even<00:00:44.399> impossible<00:00:45.289> so<00:00:46.289> for

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
difficult or it's even impossible so for

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.080 
difficult or it's even impossible so for
example<00:00:47.309> when<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:48.050> play<00:00:49.050> one<00:00:49.860> note<00:00:50.190> with<00:00:50.820> both

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
example when you play one note with both

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.290 
example when you play one note with both
hands<00:00:52.190> you<00:00:53.190> don't<00:00:53.460> think<00:00:53.789> your<00:00:53.969> hands

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
hands you don't think your hands

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.220 
hands you don't think your hands
separately<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:55.739> link<00:00:56.070> your<00:00:56.550> hands<00:00:57.149> into<00:00:58.020> one

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
separately you link your hands into one

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.740 
separately you link your hands into one
motion<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:59.120> you<00:01:00.949> and<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.579> use<00:01:02.789> one<00:01:03.239> thought

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
motion and you and you use one thought

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
motion and you and you use one thought
to<00:01:04.170> do<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.890> it's<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.330> same<00:01:06.659> when<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.530> play

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
to do it it's the same when you play

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.230 
to do it it's the same when you play
different<00:01:09.080> difficult<00:01:10.080> pieces<00:01:11.240> difficult

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
different difficult pieces difficult

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.990 
different difficult pieces difficult
places<00:01:12.570> with<00:01:13.140> both<00:01:13.439> hands<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:14.280> feel<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.760> same

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
you master a piece and when a piece is

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.320 
you master a piece and when a piece is
and<00:01:24.330> very<00:01:24.630> high<00:01:25.020> level<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:26.400> feel<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.119> do

and very high level you feel that you do
almost<00:01:27.750> nothing<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:29.119> have<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:30.799> much<00:01:32.180> freedom

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
almost nothing you have so much freedom

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:41.170 
almost nothing you have so much freedom
and<00:01:36.049> potential<00:01:37.049> for<00:01:37.829> using<00:01:38.130> your<00:01:39.000> attention

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
and potential for using your attention

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.800 
and potential for using your attention
that<00:01:42.409> you<00:01:43.409> can<00:01:43.799> stay<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.850> state<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.630> you

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
that you can stay in the state that you

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.160 
that you can stay in the state that you
do<00:01:46.020> almost<00:01:46.290> nothing<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.759> just<00:01:48.030> watch<00:01:48.450> how

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
do almost nothing and you just watch how

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.219 
do almost nothing and you just watch how
this<00:01:49.619> all<00:01:49.979> happens<00:01:50.549> so<00:01:51.470> what's<00:01:52.470> my<00:01:52.740> suggestion

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
this all happens so what's my suggestion

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.990 
this all happens so what's my suggestion
take<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.259> place<00:01:55.770> in<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.490> piece<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:58.820> link<00:01:59.820> your

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
take a place in a piece and link your

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.670 
take a place in a piece and link your
hands<00:02:00.810> movement<00:02:01.500> into<00:02:02.280> one<00:02:02.630> so<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:03.899> for

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
hands movement into one so that for

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.620 
hands movement into one so that for
example<00:02:05.159> one<00:02:05.790> hand

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
example one hand

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.919 
example one hand
moves<00:02:06.810> in<00:02:07.500> one<00:02:07.770> direction<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.729> other<00:02:09.450> in

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
moves in one direction and other in

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.430 
moves in one direction and other in
another<00:02:10.380> direction<00:02:10.920> but<00:02:11.640> you<00:02:11.760> feel<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.480> as<00:02:12.989> one

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
another direction but you feel it as one

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.280 
another direction but you feel it as one
movement<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:15.260> then<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:17.010> can<00:02:17.250> connect<00:02:17.910> all

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
movement and then you can connect all

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.259 
movement and then you can connect all
different<00:02:19.290> things<00:02:19.650> you<00:02:20.040> have<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.220> do<00:02:20.610> while

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
different things you have to do while

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.009 
different things you have to do while
playing<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.900> piano<00:02:22.130> into<00:02:23.130> one<00:02:23.370> motion<00:02:24.269> you

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
playing the piano into one motion you

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:30.350 
playing the piano into one motion you
connect<00:02:26.010> pedaling<00:02:26.989> your<00:02:28.580> left<00:02:29.580> hand<00:02:30.030> your

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
connect pedaling your left hand your

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.400 
connect pedaling your left hand your
right<00:02:30.690> hand<00:02:31.280> different<00:02:32.280> articulations

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
right hand different articulations

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.009 
right hand different articulations
everything<00:02:34.410> every<00:02:35.220> movement<00:02:35.489> you<00:02:36.000> feel<00:02:36.599> it<00:02:36.780> as

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
everything every movement you feel it as

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.309 
everything every movement you feel it as
one<00:02:37.530> so<00:02:38.069> your<00:02:38.340> body<00:02:38.640> is<00:02:38.760> one<00:02:39.060> whole<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.780> it's

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
one so your body is one whole and it's

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.550 
one so your body is one whole and it's
the<00:02:40.530> same<00:02:40.860> with<00:02:41.250> all<00:02:41.840> movements<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:43.290> your

the same with all movements that your
body<00:02:43.830> is<00:02:44.160> doing<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:45.500> this<00:02:46.670> creates<00:02:47.670> enormous

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
body is doing and this creates enormous
