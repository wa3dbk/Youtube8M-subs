00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.220
 we can think that pizza is something 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.410
 very easy thing to do 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:45.420
 let's talk a little chemistry we have three 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:48.430
 ingredients sugar salt water and yeast 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.330
 natural bana ingredients but 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.059
 when blended 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.830
 we have a reaction it is not able 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.260
 to control this reaction can 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.150
 always make pizzas but what is it 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.450
 that we really give people that's it 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.280
 the sony point uses a paw goes up 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.130
 six o'clock rich yeast pizza 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.260
 so did that you ate and can even 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.400
 look good worries happen 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.210
 later at the time of digestion 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.950
 on the other hand for me it is important 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.200
 that customers are happy but 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.670
 without the consequences I use a 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.010
 particular process that allows me 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.370
 to get a good dough well done is 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.370
 very digestible 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.330
 I give great importance to 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.610
 products I do not put anything 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.140
 on my pizzas the tomato for example 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.420
 people only use three qualities 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.580
 among the best at the piano the water the 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.710
 tv packages of vesuvius the balineau collar 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.780
 of kolba there and denies the thalia that 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.490
 I use whole you crush by hand 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.490
 I make pizzas this way 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.650
 I started also innovated I go out 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.900
 narrow rules of pizza 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.030
 Neapolitan classical forms and 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.310
 different styles and especially flours 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.040
 I varied the pizza with mutual 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.770
 our assaults wheat flour burnt flour 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.810
 wheat god senators and capelli farid 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.729
 multi-cereals and I found a flour 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.509
 fantastic course that I count 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.509
 use soon 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.959
