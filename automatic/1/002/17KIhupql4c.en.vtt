week ago I don't know but yeah obviously

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.760 
week ago I don't know but yeah obviously
squid<00:01:29.130> based<00:01:29.659> I'm<00:01:30.659> pretty<00:01:31.560> sure<00:01:31.650> he's

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
squid based I'm pretty sure he's

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.800 
squid based I'm pretty sure he's
accurate<00:01:32.250> he<00:01:32.340> has<00:01:32.460> eight<00:01:32.670> tentacles<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.720> then

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
accurate he has eight tentacles and then

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.359 
accurate he has eight tentacles and then
will<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.310> the<00:01:35.310> tentacle<00:01:35.850> tendril<00:01:36.210> things

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
will to the tentacle tendril things

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.219 
will to the tentacle tendril things
which<00:01:38.369> are<00:01:38.659> longer<00:01:39.659> than<00:01:39.869> his<00:01:40.049> actual

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
which are longer than his actual

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.230 
which are longer than his actual
tentacle<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:41.130> I'm<00:01:41.430> pretty<00:01:41.579> sure<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.820> got<00:01:41.970> it

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
tentacle so I'm pretty sure I got it

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.830 
tentacle so I'm pretty sure I got it
exactly<00:01:43.140> right<00:01:43.590> but<00:01:43.979> he<00:01:44.970> does<00:01:45.119> look<00:01:45.270> kind<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.659> a

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
exactly right but he does look kind of a

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.120 
exactly right but he does look kind of a
cartoony<00:01:46.829> with<00:01:48.170> his<00:01:49.170> eyes<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.649> stuff<00:01:49.829> but<00:01:50.100> I

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
cartoony with his eyes and stuff but I

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.170 
cartoony with his eyes and stuff but I
think<00:01:50.460> that's<00:01:50.610> fine

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
think that's fine

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.569 
think that's fine
it<00:01:51.720> does<00:01:51.930> have<00:01:52.049> Optifine<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.979> have<00:01:53.130> clear

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
it does have Optifine in I have clear

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.370 
it does have Optifine in I have clear
water<00:01:53.790> so<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.240> can<00:01:54.509> still<00:01:54.810> see<00:01:55.140> him

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
water so you can still see him

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.670 
water so you can still see him
underneath<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.369> water<00:01:56.579> here<00:01:57.229> it<00:01:58.229> looks<00:01:58.409> kind

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
underneath the water here it looks kind

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.280 
underneath the water here it looks kind
of<00:01:58.770> kind<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.340> cool<00:01:59.549> underwater<00:02:00.140> got<00:02:01.140> some

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.270 
the little spikes on the back like if I
could<00:02:41.870> animate<00:02:42.200> him<00:02:42.470> it'd<00:02:42.620> be<00:02:42.769> pretty<00:02:42.980> cool

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280

could animate him it'd be pretty cool
even<00:02:43.640> if<00:02:43.730> it<00:02:43.790> was<00:02:43.910> just<00:02:44.090> simple<00:02:44.480> or<00:02:44.720> something

even if it was just simple or something
like<00:02:45.230> just<00:02:45.560> these<00:02:46.250> actually<00:02:47.050> completing<00:02:48.050> the

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
like just these actually completing the

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.320 
like just these actually completing the
whole<00:02:48.410> smackdown<00:02:49.040> thing<00:02:49.580> that<00:02:49.820> have<00:02:49.940> going<00:02:50.209> on

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
whole smackdown thing that have going on

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.690 
whole smackdown thing that have going on
where<00:02:50.630> they<00:02:50.750> are<00:02:50.780> raised<00:02:51.440> up<00:02:51.680> and<00:02:51.830> then<00:02:51.950> coming

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
where they are raised up and then coming

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.270 
where they are raised up and then coming
down<00:02:52.730> smack<00:02:53.239> the<00:02:53.420> land<00:02:53.660> or<00:02:53.959> whatever<00:02:54.260> I<00:02:54.500> plan

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
down smack the land or whatever I plan

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.090 
down smack the land or whatever I plan
to<00:02:55.310> put<00:02:55.489> like<00:02:55.670> maybe<00:02:55.880> like<00:02:56.000> a<00:02:56.060> boat<00:02:56.390> right<00:02:56.810> here

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
to put like maybe like a boat right here

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.680 
to put like maybe like a boat right here
on<00:02:58.100> his<00:02:58.430> tentacles<00:02:58.970> and<00:02:59.180> then<00:02:59.330> this<00:02:59.510> could

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
on his tentacles and then this could

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.530 
on his tentacles and then this could
come<00:02:59.930> down<00:03:00.080> like<00:03:00.860> imagining<00:03:01.730> this<00:03:01.940> is<00:03:02.150> coming

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
come down like imagining this is coming

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.960 
come down like imagining this is coming
and<00:03:02.690> it's<00:03:02.900> match<00:03:03.769> smashing<00:03:04.400> down<00:03:04.519> onto<00:03:04.880> the

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
and it's match smashing down onto the

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.699 
and it's match smashing down onto the
boat<00:03:06.100> yeah<00:03:07.100> but<00:03:07.310> anyways<00:03:07.580> that's<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:08.709> that's

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
boat yeah but anyways that's the that's

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.390 
boat yeah but anyways that's the that's
the<00:03:09.920> Kraken<00:03:11.320> you<00:03:12.320> can<00:03:12.440> actually<00:03:12.650> go<00:03:12.920> inside<00:03:13.100> of

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
the Kraken you can actually go inside of

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.819 
the Kraken you can actually go inside of
him<00:03:13.549> that's<00:03:14.269> the<00:03:14.600> little<00:03:14.840> trick<00:03:14.900> here<00:03:15.410> is<00:03:15.620> that

if you go inside of them you start
taking<00:03:32.120> radiation<00:03:34.930> can<00:03:35.930> make<00:03:36.079> it<00:03:36.200> up<00:03:36.260> the

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
taking radiation can make it up the

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.910 
taking radiation can make it up the
water<00:03:36.970> and<00:03:37.970> here<00:03:38.930> we<00:03:39.049> go<00:03:39.170> we're<00:03:39.470> inside<00:03:39.769> the
