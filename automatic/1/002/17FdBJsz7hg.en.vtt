00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
with the Chanel foundation I would

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.170 
with the Chanel foundation I would
describe<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:26.009> as<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.549> light<00:01:27.240> floral<00:01:27.930> scent<00:01:28.560> if

you don't like perfume type smells in
your<00:01:32.670> foundation<00:01:33.390> then<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:33.930> would<00:01:34.110> be<00:01:34.259> one

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
your foundation then this would be one

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.249 
your foundation then this would be one
to<00:01:34.650> skip<00:01:35.009> because<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.299> rather<00:01:36.600> strong<00:01:37.049> when

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
to skip because it is rather strong when

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.780 
to skip because it is rather strong when
you<00:01:37.350> do<00:01:37.470> put<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.770> on<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.369> doesn't<00:01:38.520> really

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790

linger<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.540> long<00:01:39.810> throughout<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.290> day<00:01:40.470> I

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
linger that long throughout the day I

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.830 
linger that long throughout the day I

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.550 
overwhelming that is the beauty blending
side<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.360> on<00:01:48.420> this<00:01:48.540> side<00:01:48.600> we'll<00:01:48.899> use<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.259> brush

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
side and on this side we'll use a brush

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.149 
side and on this side we'll use a brush
and<00:01:50.659> if<00:01:51.659> you're<00:01:51.869> wondering<00:01:52.350> what<00:01:52.799> type<00:01:53.130> of

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
and if you're wondering what type of

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.690 
and if you're wondering what type of
coverage<00:01:53.759> this<00:01:54.509> provides<00:01:55.079> I<00:01:55.560> would<00:01:56.399> say<00:01:56.579> it's

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
coverage this provides I would say it's

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.310 
coverage this provides I would say it's
more<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.030> medium<00:01:57.450> coverage<00:01:57.689> but<00:01:58.140> it's

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
more of a medium coverage but it's

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.499 
more of a medium coverage but it's
buildable<00:01:58.860> it's<00:01:59.460> one<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.790> those<00:01:59.880> where<00:02:00.210> you

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
buildable it's one of those where you

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.770 
buildable it's one of those where you
can<00:02:01.140> apply<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.770> really<00:02:02.250> light<00:02:02.610> layer<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.390> get<00:02:03.750> a

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
can apply a really light layer and get a

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.600 
can apply a really light layer and get a
little<00:02:04.140> bit<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.290> coverage<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:05.280> can<00:02:05.369> ply<00:02:05.579> a

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
little bit of coverage you can ply a

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.069 
little bit of coverage you can ply a
little<00:02:05.820> bit<00:02:05.939> more<00:02:06.090> get<00:02:06.240> medium<00:02:06.540> coverage<00:02:06.930> and

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
little bit more get medium coverage and

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.690 
little bit more get medium coverage and
then<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.259> can<00:02:07.409> apply<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.710> second<00:02:08.190> layer<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.610> it

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
then you can apply a second layer and it

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.339 
then you can apply a second layer and it
will<00:02:08.729> give<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:09.000> more<00:02:09.179> of<00:02:09.209> that<00:02:09.360> heavy

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
will give you more of that heavy

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.440 
will give you more of that heavy
coverage<00:02:10.800> if<00:02:11.069> that's

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
coverage if that's

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.570 
coverage if that's
you're<00:02:11.569> looking<00:02:11.840> for<00:02:12.080> so<00:02:12.440> I<00:02:12.650> do<00:02:12.739> like<00:02:13.040> how

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
you're looking for so I do like how

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.030 
you're looking for so I do like how
buildable<00:02:14.030> this<00:02:14.330> foundation<00:02:14.840> is<00:02:15.020> and<00:02:15.349> that<00:02:15.950> is

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
buildable this foundation is and that is

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.860 
buildable this foundation is and that is
the<00:02:16.160> final<00:02:16.430> application<00:02:16.940> with<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.239> brush<00:02:17.480> it

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
the final application with the brush it

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.479 
the final application with the brush it
do<00:02:17.989> you<00:02:18.050> feel<00:02:18.200> like<00:02:18.319> there<00:02:18.530> is<00:02:18.650> a<00:02:18.680> small

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
do you feel like there is a small

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.130 
do you feel like there is a small
difference<00:02:20.060> between<00:02:20.480> applying<00:02:20.810> it<00:02:20.989> with<00:02:21.080> a

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
difference between applying it with a

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.540 
difference between applying it with a

the<00:02:22.940> Beauty<00:02:23.180> Blender<00:02:23.269> side<00:02:23.660> just<00:02:23.900> looks<00:02:24.019> a

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
the Beauty Blender side just looks a

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.290 
the Beauty Blender side just looks a
little<00:02:24.260> bit<00:02:24.379> more<00:02:24.560> smooth<00:02:25.099> and<00:02:25.519> even<00:02:25.849> more

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
little bit more smooth and even more

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.170 
little bit more smooth and even more
like<00:02:26.450> skin<00:02:26.870> where<00:02:27.500> I<00:02:27.530> can<00:02:27.680> kind<00:02:28.040> of<00:02:28.220> see<00:02:28.550> the

like the side where I applied it with
the<00:03:02.390> Beauty<00:03:02.660> Blender<00:03:02.780> is<00:03:03.049> much<00:03:03.560> less<00:03:03.829> shiny

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
the Beauty Blender is much less shiny

the Beauty Blender is much less shiny
for<00:03:04.760> some<00:03:04.940> reason<00:03:05.450> I<00:03:05.690> don't<00:03:06.110> know<00:03:06.260> why<00:03:06.290> that

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
for some reason I don't know why that

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:07.990 
for some reason I don't know why that
would<00:03:06.739> make<00:03:06.920> a<00:03:06.950> difference<00:03:07.459> but<00:03:07.730> it's<00:03:07.910> a

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
would make a difference but it's a

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.490 
would make a difference but it's a
little<00:03:08.120> more<00:03:08.390> shiny<00:03:08.690> on<00:03:08.900> this<00:03:09.079> side<00:03:09.260> where<00:03:09.440> I

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
little more shiny on this side where I

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.250
