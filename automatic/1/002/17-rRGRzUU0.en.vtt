00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 Hello you and welcome 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.130
 to a new video of game me 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.649
 toys 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.840
 I have a toy again today 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.540
 tepic or pepper potts for 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.199
 you and pepper picnic set that 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.970
 means as much as peppers picnic 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:19.890
 kneads that fits quite well because of 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.910
 Temperatures are gradually rising 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.609
 already gets such a real 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.380
 summer feeling and there is a picnic 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:28.470
 just right this time from kneading and 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.570
 not with s rail things but that has 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:36.290
 whatever we take it easy 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.290
 Let's take a closer look 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.370
 this is a real suitcase here in front 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.370
 you can not mind 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:08.430
 and here all the parts once 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:11.189
 a blue car kneading then green papic 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.020
 Kneading in Germany is known as 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.400
 Dad will not be surprised that it is 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:22.729
 we have a silver piggy pink 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.729
 then still and here we have yellow 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.110
 we still just items i see 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:34.650
 ever a scherer 1 tel 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:38.600
 an injection that will be here 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.600
 probably as a game had to be 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.790
 and that was it already this cardboard 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.450
 was just there so to speak so that 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.430
 do not share 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.090
 hurled around in the suitcase 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.090
 become 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.400
 here you see now something all 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.270
 I've been there too now 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.890
 This picnic mat cleared up this time 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.230
 but a bit star, therefore 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.330
 first we have to lay down here 

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:12.190
 different figures once pepper 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.970
 then you can make kneading figures out of it 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:19.240
 then her brother george here again 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:23.320
 pepper with a ball and george with 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.370
 a dino sees this syringe 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.980
 a bit out of the ordinary 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.680
 spaghetti or something like that can be done with the front 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.520
 Then you could shear these spaghetti 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:36.700
 cut off and then we have 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.630
 Pineapple and grapes for grapes oranges 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.460
 apples 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.390
 So it will be a very healthy picnic 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.040
 However, we will only then in the 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.360
 I'll do my next video 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.740
 video you liked now 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.270
 Give me a thumbs up 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.100

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.720

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.470

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.470
