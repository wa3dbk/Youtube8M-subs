00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:04.990
 slob 

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:11.819
 Ghent 

00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:18.730
 k 

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:22.499
 choose 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:26.339
 campbell 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:34.850
 the 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.850
 the 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.570
 this was it 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.620
 a ball during the Ajax game Piet had the books rest which they thought 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.700
 I felt 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.860
 we want to extinguish the law with the previous match 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.590
 no but the parties with 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.900
 the main reason 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.100
 the parties have a little objection 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.420
 we want to know where you will be brought up again 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.450
 members the referee 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.750
 thats may be happy with the dutch referees if you like this 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.450
 have seen 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.700
 want the third place 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.530
 but he comes to work there westerwelle also said that then I can 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.300
 very striking it is beautiful to see 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.450
 and that appears from further measurements we have what the average Dutchman 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.260
 seems like an excellent year for the tire stack 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.490
 year 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.350
 can be refused 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.910
 arrested the fall man from emmen after he had years of experience 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.700
 were counting on a decline 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.709
 he got it by e-mail but I actually think spain is just winning 

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:14.689
 leading my life third became better examples i'm also afraid they 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:17.239
 is right 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.620
 what we wanted to achieve that the goods were broken
