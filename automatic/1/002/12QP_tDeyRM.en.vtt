00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.590 
think it's about something just gonna
happen<00:02:11.989> something's<00:02:12.590> gonna<00:02:12.769> happen<00:02:13.570> what<00:02:14.570> I

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
happen something's gonna happen what I

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.229 
happen something's gonna happen what I
thought<00:02:15.019> was<00:02:15.260> maybe<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:16.430> rule<00:02:16.610> is<00:02:16.760> gonna<00:02:17.000> end

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
thought was maybe the rule is gonna end

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.300 
thought was maybe the rule is gonna end
maybe<00:02:17.510> they're<00:02:17.810> telling<00:02:18.320> us<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.800> rules<00:02:18.950> gonna

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
maybe they're telling us the rules gonna

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
maybe they're telling us the rules gonna
end<00:02:19.610> I<00:02:19.970> think<00:02:20.780> they<00:02:21.230> want<00:02:24.100> people<00:02:25.100> to<00:02:25.610> know

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330
