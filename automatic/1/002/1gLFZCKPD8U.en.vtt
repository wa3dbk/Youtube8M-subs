thing<00:00:37.410> we're<00:00:37.530> going<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.739> do<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:37.920> we're<00:00:38.040> going

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
thing we're going to do is we're going

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.950 
thing we're going to do is we're going
to<00:00:38.190> lift<00:00:38.370> up<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.640> vehicle<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.180> we're<00:00:39.840> going

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
to lift up the vehicle and we're going

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.000 
to lift up the vehicle and we're going
to<00:00:39.989> take<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.290> look<00:00:40.500> at<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.739> wheel<00:00:40.980> that

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
to take a look at the wheel that

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.360 
to take a look at the wheel that
corresponds<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.120> code<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.360> we<00:00:42.600> have<00:00:42.809> and

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
corresponds to the code that we have and

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.010 
corresponds to the code that we have and
what<00:00:44.370> we're<00:00:44.489> looking<00:00:44.610> for<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.660> exciter

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
what we're looking for is the exciter

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.290 
what we're looking for is the exciter
ring<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.379> be<00:00:46.500> broken<00:00:47.039> or<00:00:47.190> disconnected<00:00:47.910> or

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
ring to be broken or disconnected or

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.740 
ring to be broken or disconnected or
cracked<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:50.100> case<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.550> has<00:00:50.730> all<00:00:51.360> of

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
cracked and in this case it has all of

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.229 
cracked and in this case it has all of
all<00:00:52.289> those<00:00:52.590> things<00:00:52.860> it's<00:00:53.430> cracked<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:54.059> is

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
all those things it's cracked this is

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.939 
all those things it's cracked this is
connected<00:00:54.719> it's<00:00:54.930> actually<00:00:55.350> out<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.530> place

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
connected it's actually out of place

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.090 
connected it's actually out of place
from<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.309> CV<00:00:56.579> shaft<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:57.090> slipped<00:00:57.360> off<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:58.100> it

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
from the CV shaft it slipped off and it

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.270 
from the CV shaft it slipped off and it
set<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.430> code<00:00:59.690> and<00:01:00.690> what<00:01:01.140> happens<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.949> rust

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
set a code and what happens is that rust

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.070 
set a code and what happens is that rust
builds<00:01:02.609> up<00:01:02.730> in<00:01:02.910> between<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.239> exciter<00:01:03.780> ring

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
builds up in between the exciter ring

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.520 
builds up in between the exciter ring
and<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.739> actual<00:01:05.070> shaft<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:06.720> expands<00:01:07.409> and

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
and the actual shaft and it expands and

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.560 
and the actual shaft and it expands and
because<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.340> exciter<00:01:08.760> ring<00:01:09.000> is<00:01:09.240> made<00:01:09.390> out<00:01:09.540> of

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
because the exciter ring is made out of

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.560 
because the exciter ring is made out of
a<00:01:09.720> cast<00:01:10.409> aluminum<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:11.430> has<00:01:11.670> little<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.119> no<00:01:12.150> give

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
a cast aluminum it has little to no give

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.350 
a cast aluminum it has little to no give
and<00:01:13.040> it's<00:01:14.040> got<00:01:14.220> nowhere<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.520> go<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.030> cracks

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
and it's got nowhere to go and it cracks

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.840 
and it's got nowhere to go and it cracks
it<00:01:15.689> cracks<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.770> gets<00:01:16.920> loose<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.580> starts

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
it cracks it gets loose and it starts

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.170 
it cracks it gets loose and it starts
falling<00:01:18.000> off<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.360> shaft<00:01:18.600> like<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:19.790> so<00:01:20.790> from

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
falling off the shaft like that so from

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.609 
falling off the shaft like that so from
here<00:01:21.360> what<00:01:21.540> we're<00:01:21.630> going<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.810> do<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:22.080> we're

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
here what we're going to do is we're

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.719 
here what we're going to do is we're
going<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:23.040> quote<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:24.619> CV<00:01:25.619> shaft<00:01:25.830> assembly<00:01:26.100> and

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
going to a quote a CV shaft assembly and

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.490 
going to a quote a CV shaft assembly and
it's<00:01:26.909> going<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.150> come<00:01:27.420> with<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.869> exciter<00:01:28.229> ring

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
it's going to come with the exciter ring

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.190 
it's going to come with the exciter ring
or<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:28.799> press<00:01:28.979> down<00:01:29.250> there<00:01:29.810> there<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:30.990> a

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
or you press down there there is a

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.880 
or you press down there there is a
repair<00:01:31.890> option<00:01:33.200> for<00:01:34.200> those<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.590> who<00:01:34.710> want

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
repair option for those of you who want

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.460 
repair option for those of you who want
to<00:01:34.950> repair<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.640> they<00:01:36.360> do<00:01:36.420> sell<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.110> exciter

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
to repair it they do sell the exciter

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.780 
to repair it they do sell the exciter
ring<00:01:37.740> from<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.040> dealer<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.430> don't<00:01:38.670> know<00:01:38.729> if

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
ring from the dealer I don't know if

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.760 
ring from the dealer I don't know if
they<00:01:38.909> still<00:01:39.240> do<00:01:39.450> but<00:01:39.689> they<00:01:40.020> did<00:01:40.470> at<00:01:40.590> one<00:01:40.740> point

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
they still do but they did at one point

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.399 
they still do but they did at one point
and<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.939> can<00:01:42.090> remove<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.509> shaft<00:01:42.750> clean<00:01:43.259> up

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
and you can remove the shaft clean up

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.830 
and you can remove the shaft clean up
the<00:01:43.710> area<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.399> repress<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.329> exciter<00:01:45.600> ring

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
the area and repress the exciter ring

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.219 
the area and repress the exciter ring
onto<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.290> shaft<00:01:47.060> but<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.210> success<00:01:48.630> rate<00:01:48.930> for

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
onto the shaft but the success rate for

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.160 
onto the shaft but the success rate for
a<00:01:49.290> successful<00:01:49.920> repair<00:01:50.250> is<00:01:50.729> not<00:01:51.659> very<00:01:51.930> high

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
a successful repair is not very high

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.740 
a successful repair is not very high
they<00:01:52.530> do<00:01:52.590> tend<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:52.979> come<00:01:53.159> back<00:01:53.399> for<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:53.880> falling
