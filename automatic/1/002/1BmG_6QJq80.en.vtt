00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.870 
reason but who knows who knows it's also
even<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:04.829> was<00:02:04.950> also<00:02:05.070> even<00:02:05.369> rumored<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:05.729> they

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
even it was also even rumored that they

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.550 
even it was also even rumored that they
only<00:02:06.030> had<00:02:06.240> like<00:02:06.420> 40<00:02:06.869> percent<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.380> game

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
only had like 40 percent of the game

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.999 
only had like 40 percent of the game
done<00:02:07.890> about<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.729> month<00:02:08.970> ago<00:02:09.259> so<00:02:10.259> I<00:02:10.619> mean<00:02:10.830> I<00:02:10.860> guess

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
done about a month ago so I mean I guess

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.410 
done about a month ago so I mean I guess
it's<00:02:11.250> understandable<00:02:11.849> that<00:02:11.910> they<00:02:12.090> needed<00:02:12.300> to

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
it's understandable that they needed to

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.110 
it's understandable that they needed to
delay<00:02:12.840> it

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
delay it

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.690 
delay it
so<00:02:13.530> what<00:02:14.530> are<00:02:14.590> we<00:02:14.680> going<00:02:14.769> to<00:02:14.860> do<00:02:14.980> we're<00:02:15.610> going

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
so what are we going to do we're going

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.789 
so what are we going to do we're going
to<00:02:15.790> see<00:02:15.909> gameplay<00:02:16.360> at<00:02:16.480> e3<00:02:16.690> so<00:02:17.260> we<00:02:17.379> can<00:02:17.530> all<00:02:17.650> look

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
to see gameplay at e3 so we can all look

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:19.170 
to see gameplay at e3 so we can all look
