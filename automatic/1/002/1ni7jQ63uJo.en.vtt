inside<00:02:49.880> this<00:02:50.299> frog<00:02:50.690> inside<00:02:51.230> this<00:02:51.440> week<00:02:51.769> is

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
inside this frog inside this week is

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.750 
inside this frog inside this week is
what<00:02:52.970> really<00:02:53.390> needs<00:02:53.420> to<00:02:53.690> come<00:02:53.959> out<00:02:54.459> horses<00:02:55.459> get

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
what really needs to come out horses get

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.569 
what really needs to come out horses get
a<00:02:55.790> condition<00:02:56.390> called<00:02:56.630> brushes<00:02:57.440> which<00:02:58.280> again

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
a condition called brushes which again

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:03.940 
a condition called brushes which again
is<00:02:58.640> just<00:02:59.000> another

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.850 

fungus<00:03:05.240> and<00:03:06.240> it's<00:03:06.420> an<00:03:06.840> anaerobic<00:03:07.290> fungus

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
fungus and it's an anaerobic fungus

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.580 
fungus and it's an anaerobic fungus
which<00:03:08.280> means<00:03:08.580> all<00:03:08.910> it<00:03:09.780> takes<00:03:10.020> to<00:03:10.140> keep<00:03:10.260> your

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
which means all it takes to keep your

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.050 
which means all it takes to keep your
horse<00:03:10.740> from<00:03:11.010> getting<00:03:11.280> thrushes<00:03:11.700> picking<00:03:12.000> a

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
horse from getting thrushes picking a

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.210 
horse from getting thrushes picking a
speed<00:03:12.300> out<00:03:12.390> every<00:03:12.630> day<00:03:12.950> anaerobic<00:03:13.950> means

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
speed out every day anaerobic means

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.580 
speed out every day anaerobic means
without<00:03:14.400> oxygen<00:03:14.760> it<00:03:15.420> needs<00:03:15.450> so<00:03:16.020> what<00:03:16.260> so<00:03:16.470> the

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
without oxygen it needs so what so the

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.260 
without oxygen it needs so what so the
horses<00:03:16.980> they<00:03:17.130> get<00:03:17.310> thrush<00:03:17.640> are<00:03:17.910> the<00:03:18.060> horses

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
horses they get thrush are the horses

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:19.810 
horses they get thrush are the horses
that<00:03:18.570> never<00:03:18.750> get<00:03:18.930> their<00:03:19.050> feet<00:03:19.230> picked<00:03:19.470> out

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
that never get their feet picked out

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.490 
that never get their feet picked out
because<00:03:20.820> it's<00:03:21.240> wrong<00:03:21.390> is<00:03:21.810> going<00:03:21.840> to<00:03:22.080> get<00:03:22.350> an

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
because it's wrong is going to get an

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.920 
because it's wrong is going to get an
oxygen-deprived<00:03:23.490> environment<00:03:23.670> it<00:03:24.450> cannot

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
oxygen-deprived environment it cannot

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.500 
oxygen-deprived environment it cannot
grow<00:03:25.320> when<00:03:25.980> their<00:03:26.130> feet<00:03:26.310> are<00:03:26.430> clean<00:03:26.610> so<00:03:27.360> if<00:03:27.420> you

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
grow when their feet are clean so if you

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.540 
grow when their feet are clean so if you
pick<00:03:27.690> their<00:03:27.840> feet<00:03:28.020> out<00:03:28.170> every<00:03:28.440> day<00:03:28.590> they<00:03:29.310> won't

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
pick their feet out every day they won't

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.990 
pick their feet out every day they won't
get<00:03:29.700> that<00:03:32.180> back<00:03:33.180> legs<00:03:33.510> are<00:03:34.080> a<00:03:34.140> little<00:03:34.320> harder

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
get that back legs are a little harder

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.250 
get that back legs are a little harder
again<00:03:36.000> that's<00:03:36.270> something<00:03:36.450> that<00:03:36.690> takes<00:03:36.990> its

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
again that's something that takes its

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.690 
again that's something that takes its
something<00:03:37.620> to<00:03:37.680> take<00:03:37.860> practice<00:03:38.370> and<00:03:38.580> it's

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
something to take practice and it's

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.740 
something to take practice and it's
something<00:03:38.910> that<00:03:39.090> you're<00:03:39.330> going<00:03:39.450> to<00:03:39.510> want<00:03:39.630> to

do in really easy horses and it's

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:42.800 
do in really easy horses and it's
something<00:03:41.700> that's<00:03:42.000> a<00:03:42.090> little<00:03:42.240> bit<00:03:42.540> more

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
something that's a little bit more

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.960 
something that's a little bit more
