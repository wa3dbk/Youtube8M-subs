in sales he's always moving and he keeps
pens<00:01:42.659> in<00:01:42.810> fact<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.140> shirts<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.530> make<00:01:43.770> for<00:01:44.040> him

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
pens in fact the shirts I make for him

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.580 
pens in fact the shirts I make for him
have<00:01:44.490> special<00:01:45.000> pockets<00:01:45.390> on<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.600> inside<00:01:46.079> for

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
have special pockets on the inside for

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.609 
have special pockets on the inside for
holding<00:01:47.040> his<00:01:47.460> pens<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.180> he<00:01:49.170> doesn't<00:01:49.470> really

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
holding his pens and he doesn't really

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.830 
holding his pens and he doesn't really
use<00:01:49.890> ones<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.280> leak<00:01:50.970> ink<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:51.479> I<00:01:51.509> don't<00:01:51.720> think

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
use ones that leak ink so I don't think

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.690 
use ones that leak ink so I don't think
he's<00:01:51.960> ever<00:01:52.110> actually<00:01:52.590> lost<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:53.070> shirt<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:53.280> those

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
he's ever actually lost a shirt so those

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.060 
he's ever actually lost a shirt so those
of<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.060> object<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.600> but<00:01:55.259> if<00:01:55.530> you

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
of you that object to that but if you

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.359 
of you that object to that but if you
use<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.640> go<00:01:57.329> for<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.630> but<00:01:58.049> don't<00:01:58.079> stuff<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.159> with

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
use it go for it but don't stuff it with

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.520 
use it go for it but don't stuff it with
a<00:01:59.399> pocket<00:01:59.790> square<00:01:59.909> okay<00:02:00.719> let's<00:02:01.320> go<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:02.280> vests

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
a pocket square okay let's go to vests

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.740 
a pocket square okay let's go to vests
sometimes<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.829> think<00:02:05.430> actually<00:02:05.880> if<00:02:06.540> you're

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
sometimes I think actually if you're

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.710 
sometimes I think actually if you're
wearing<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.140> vest<00:02:07.350> under<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.310> jacket<00:02:08.580> no<00:02:09.270> but

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
wearing the vest under a jacket no but

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.360 
wearing the vest under a jacket no but
if<00:02:09.810> you're<00:02:09.929> wearing<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.410> vest<00:02:10.560> by<00:02:10.950> itself

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
if you're wearing the vest by itself

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.740 
if you're wearing the vest by itself
which<00:02:11.550> I've<00:02:11.670> seen<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.849> lot<00:02:12.120> of<00:02:12.150> men<00:02:12.420> do<00:02:12.569> this

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
which I've seen a lot of men do this

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.970 
which I've seen a lot of men do this
especially<00:02:13.230> a<00:02:13.260> kind<00:02:13.650> of<00:02:13.680> good<00:02:13.800> for

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
especially a kind of good for

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.890 
especially a kind of good for
he's<00:02:14.099> a<00:02:14.129> photographer<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.970> for<00:02:15.450> him<00:02:15.540> he<00:02:15.659> wants

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
he's a photographer and for him he wants

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.509 
he's a photographer and for him he wants
to<00:02:15.989> have<00:02:16.080> his<00:02:16.110> arms<00:02:16.620> but<00:02:16.890> he's<00:02:16.980> at<00:02:17.129> weddings

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
to have his arms but he's at weddings

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:18.860 
to have his arms but he's at weddings
all<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.790> time<00:02:17.970> so<00:02:18.060> he<00:02:18.120> wants<00:02:18.330> that<00:02:18.420> his<00:02:18.540> arms

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
all the time so he wants that his arms

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.780 
all the time so he wants that his arms
free<00:02:19.140> because<00:02:19.530> he's<00:02:19.709> moving<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.220> he<00:02:20.310> uses<00:02:20.549> the

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
free because he's moving and he uses the

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.789 
free because he's moving and he uses the
pockets<00:02:21.209> to<00:02:21.269> actually<00:02:21.629> hold<00:02:21.780> pieces<00:02:22.470> of<00:02:22.620> gear

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
pockets to actually hold pieces of gear

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.430 
pockets to actually hold pieces of gear
but<00:02:23.459> he<00:02:23.700> wants<00:02:24.629> to<00:02:24.780> look<00:02:24.900> good

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
but he wants to look good

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.619 
but he wants to look good
so<00:02:25.680> I<00:02:25.890> think<00:02:26.069> he<00:02:26.459> wears<00:02:26.640> a<00:02:26.700> bow<00:02:27.030> tie<00:02:27.299> what<00:02:27.510> else

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
so I think he wears a bow tie what else

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.930 
so I think he wears a bow tie what else
did<00:02:27.840> but<00:02:28.110> he<00:02:28.200> does<00:02:28.379> stuff<00:02:28.709> pockets<00:02:29.549> quiver<00:02:29.730> and

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
did but he does stuff pockets quiver and

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.449 
did but he does stuff pockets quiver and
it<00:02:30.030> looks<00:02:30.209> good<00:02:30.390> it<00:02:30.690> shows<00:02:31.620> that<00:02:31.830> he<00:02:32.010> went<00:02:32.280> the

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
it looks good it shows that he went the

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.369 
it looks good it shows that he went the
extra<00:02:32.489> mile<00:02:32.970> but<00:02:33.120> at<00:02:33.299> the<00:02:33.480> same<00:02:33.720> time<00:02:33.959> he's<00:02:34.230> at

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
extra mile but at the same time he's at

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.250 
extra mile but at the same time he's at
work<00:02:34.650> so<00:02:35.069> he<00:02:35.580> follows<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.510> function<00:02:37.049> path

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
work so he follows the function path

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.320 
work so he follows the function path
which<00:02:37.530> I<00:02:37.680> always<00:02:37.950> believe<00:02:38.160> function<00:02:39.060> first

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
which I always believe function first

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.350 
which I always believe function first
style<00:02:40.049> second<00:02:40.590> so<00:02:40.950> in<00:02:41.160> that<00:02:41.310> case<00:02:41.549> looks<00:02:42.090> great

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
style second so in that case looks great

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.240 
style second so in that case looks great
if<00:02:42.540> you're<00:02:43.170> just<00:02:43.349> going<00:02:43.530> out<00:02:43.709> on<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:43.980> town

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
if you're just going out on the town

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.430 
if you're just going out on the town
perhaps<00:02:45.150> why<00:02:45.390> not<00:02:45.569> but<00:02:45.690> don't<00:02:45.840> overdo<00:02:46.260> it

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
perhaps why not but don't overdo it

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.780 
perhaps why not but don't overdo it
don't<00:02:46.620> have<00:02:46.769> that<00:02:46.799> thing<00:02:47.069> just<00:02:47.310> like<00:02:47.459> falling

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
don't have that thing just like falling

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.229 
don't have that thing just like falling
out<00:02:48.060> there<00:02:48.299> with<00:02:49.290> a<00:02:49.319> jacket<00:02:49.860> I<00:02:50.010> think<00:02:50.549> a<00:02:50.879> jacket

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
out there with a jacket I think a jacket

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.479 
out there with a jacket I think a jacket
should<00:02:51.420> always<00:02:51.629> have<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:52.590> pocket<00:02:53.099> square<00:02:53.190> I

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
should always have a pocket square I

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.099 
should always have a pocket square I
know<00:02:53.760> it<00:02:54.000> takes<00:02:54.180> a<00:02:54.359> while<00:02:54.510> for<00:02:54.540> guys<00:02:54.870> to<00:02:55.019> get

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109 
know it takes a while for guys to get

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:55.699 
know it takes a while for guys to get
used<00:02:55.349> to<00:02:55.470> it

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
used to it

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.190 
used to it
but<00:02:56.099> I<00:02:56.250> have<00:02:56.489> a<00:02:56.519> gentleman<00:02:57.299> client<00:02:57.690> over<00:02:57.989> in

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
but I have a gentleman client over in

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.619 
but I have a gentleman client over in
Dubai<00:02:58.920> named<00:02:59.370> Sandy<00:02:59.849> and<00:03:00.150> he<00:03:00.269> talked<00:03:00.540> about

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
Dubai named Sandy and he talked about

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.390 
Dubai named Sandy and he talked about
how<00:03:00.930> he<00:03:00.989> just<00:03:01.200> left<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.680> other<00:03:01.829> day<00:03:01.920> forgot

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
how he just left the other day forgot

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.949 
how he just left the other day forgot
his<00:03:02.579> pocket<00:03:02.940> square<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.299> how<00:03:03.569> he<00:03:03.629> had<00:03:03.840> to

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
his pocket square and how he had to

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.380 
his pocket square and how he had to
actually<00:03:04.140> stop<00:03:04.709> at<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:05.010> store<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.910> buy<00:03:05.940> one

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
actually stop at a store to buy one

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.449 
actually stop at a store to buy one
because<00:03:06.540> he<00:03:06.750> felt<00:03:06.989> incomplete<00:03:07.829> without<00:03:08.069> it

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
because he felt incomplete without it

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.460 
because he felt incomplete without it
when<00:03:08.879> you<00:03:09.000> can<00:03:09.180> get<00:03:09.299> to<00:03:09.450> that<00:03:09.569> feeling<00:03:10.019> it's<00:03:10.379> a

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
when you can get to that feeling it's a

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.990 
when you can get to that feeling it's a
great<00:03:10.709> place<00:03:10.920> because<00:03:11.160> people<00:03:11.489> notice<00:03:11.670> these

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
great place because people notice these

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.750 
great place because people notice these
pocket<00:03:12.359> squares<00:03:12.569> and<00:03:13.010> start<00:03:14.010> off<00:03:14.129> small<00:03:14.310> start
