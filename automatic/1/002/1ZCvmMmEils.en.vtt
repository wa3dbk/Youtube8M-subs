if<00:00:01.350> it's<00:00:01.589> that<00:00:08.389> hey<00:00:09.679> that<00:00:10.679> was<00:00:11.160> a<00:00:11.190> hard<00:00:11.490> one

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
if it's that hey that was a hard one

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.180 
if it's that hey that was a hard one
because<00:00:11.910> this<00:00:12.900> balls<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.380> little<00:00:13.500> bit<00:00:13.710> magic

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
because this balls a little bit magic

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.150 
because this balls a little bit magic
it's<00:00:14.370> got<00:00:14.670> a<00:00:15.360> bit<00:00:15.690> of<00:00:15.809> string<00:00:16.199> glued<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:17.010> the

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
it's got a bit of string glued to the

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.040 
it's got a bit of string glued to the
left<00:00:17.400> side<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.850> it<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.359> make<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.600> ball<00:00:19.020> curve

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
left side of it to make the ball curve

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.349 
left side of it to make the ball curve
to<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.619> lab<00:00:19.800> why<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:20.430> that<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:21.240> that's

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
to the lab why is that and that's

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.750 
to the lab why is that and that's
because<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.960> air<00:00:22.140> that's<00:00:22.710> flowing<00:00:22.980> from<00:00:23.640> the

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
because the air that's flowing from the

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.009 
because the air that's flowing from the
front<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.150> ball<00:00:24.359> around<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.869> back

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
front of the ball around to the back

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.429 
front of the ball around to the back
encounters<00:00:25.769> this<00:00:26.010> seam<00:00:27.109> becomes<00:00:28.109> turbulent

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
encounters this seam becomes turbulent

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.780 
encounters this seam becomes turbulent
and<00:00:28.949> turbulent<00:00:29.849> air<00:00:30.060> is<00:00:30.480> known<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.590> stick<00:00:32.579> to

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
and turbulent air is known to stick to

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.360 
and turbulent air is known to stick to
the<00:00:32.880> ball<00:00:33.059> longer<00:00:33.690> than<00:00:34.020> smooth<00:00:34.770> or<00:00:34.950> laminar

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
the ball longer than smooth or laminar

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.930 
the ball longer than smooth or laminar
flow<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.750> air<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:37.140> deflected<00:00:37.940> this

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
flow and so the air is deflected this

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.580 
flow and so the air is deflected this
way<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.660> right<00:00:39.870> on<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.200> ball

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
way to the right on the ball

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.260 
way to the right on the ball
and<00:00:40.680> therefore<00:00:41.340> there's<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.610> force<00:00:41.940> on<00:00:42.149> the

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
and therefore there's a force on the

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.750 
and therefore there's a force on the
ball<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.960> left<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.890> curves<00:00:44.190> so<00:00:44.640> in

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
ball to the left and so it curves so in

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.910 
ball to the left and so it curves so in
this<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.300> quite<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.750> light<00:00:46.079> ball<00:00:46.350> so<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.649> curves

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
this is quite a light ball so it curves

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
this is quite a light ball so it curves
a<00:00:47.070> long<00:00:47.219> way<00:00:47.430> huh<00:00:48.170> but<00:00:49.170> on<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.860> cricket<00:00:50.219> ball<00:00:50.340> the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
a long way huh but on a cricket ball the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.000 
a long way huh but on a cricket ball the
seam<00:00:51.180> isn't<00:00:51.510> on<00:00:51.660> one<00:00:51.899> side<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.379> seems<00:00:52.620> down<00:00:52.890> the

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
seam isn't on one side it seems down the

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.299 
seam isn't on one side it seems down the
middle

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
middle

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.139 
middle
correct<00:00:54.149> it's<00:00:54.840> spinning<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.649> such<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.920> way<00:00:56.250> that

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
correct it's spinning in such a way that

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.380 
correct it's spinning in such a way that
the<00:00:58.020> seams<00:00:58.350> inclined<00:00:58.980> at<00:00:59.370> an<00:00:59.489> angle<00:00:59.670> to<00:01:00.270> the

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
the seams inclined at an angle to the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.569 
the seams inclined at an angle to the
direction<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.899> motion<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.500> ball<00:01:01.710> in<00:01:02.399> which

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
direction of motion of the ball in which

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.080 
direction of motion of the ball in which
case<00:01:02.910> air<00:01:03.390> coming<00:01:04.110> towards<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.100> ball<00:01:05.309> will

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
case air coming towards the ball will

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.510 
case air coming towards the ball will
flow<00:01:06.360> smoothly<00:01:07.080> around<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.710> smooth<00:01:07.950> side<00:01:08.250> and

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
flow smoothly around the smooth side and

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.690 
flow smoothly around the smooth side and
separates<00:01:09.390> from<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.900> ball<00:01:10.080> air<00:01:10.860> flowing<00:01:11.490> on

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
separates from the ball air flowing on

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.320 
separates from the ball air flowing on
the<00:01:12.630> rough<00:01:12.869> side<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.470> same<00:01:13.710> side<00:01:14.330> becomes

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
the rough side the same side becomes

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.359 
the rough side the same side becomes
turbulent<00:01:15.659> as<00:01:16.170> soon<00:01:16.380> as<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.650> encounters<00:01:17.009> that

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
turbulent as soon as it encounters that

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.149 
turbulent as soon as it encounters that
seam<00:01:17.729> gets<00:01:18.330> deflected<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.290> left<00:01:19.500> mm-hmm

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
seam gets deflected to the left mm-hmm

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.100 
seam gets deflected to the left mm-hmm
and<00:01:20.280> therefore<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.909> ball<00:01:21.090> gets<00:01:21.360> deflected<00:01:21.689> to

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
and therefore the ball gets deflected to

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.310 
and therefore the ball gets deflected to
the<00:01:22.140> right<00:01:22.350> so<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.580> basically<00:01:24.090> make<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.020> rough

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
the right so you basically make a rough

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.440 
the right so you basically make a rough
side<00:01:25.560> using<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.130> seam<00:01:26.490> by<00:01:26.820> angling<00:01:27.390> the

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
side using that seam by angling the

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.870 
side using that seam by angling the
scene<00:01:27.750> with<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.770> cricket<00:01:29.070> ball<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.610> cricket

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
scene with a cricket ball the cricket

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.580 
scene with a cricket ball the cricket
ball<00:01:30.000> or<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.659> can<00:01:30.869> have<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.079> rough<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.530> a

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
ball or you can have a rough and a

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.649 
ball or you can have a rough and a
smooth<00:01:31.860> side<00:01:32.100> because<00:01:32.549> as<00:01:32.579> time<00:01:33.030> goes<00:01:33.450> on

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
smooth side because as time goes on

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.420 
smooth side because as time goes on
during<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.079> game<00:01:34.290> one<00:01:34.500> side<00:01:34.799> gets<00:01:35.040> rougher

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
during the game one side gets rougher

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.789 
during the game one side gets rougher
than<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.670> other<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.659> players<00:01:36.930> maintain<00:01:37.590> the

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
than the other the players maintain the

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.780 
than the other the players maintain the
smooth<00:01:38.100> side<00:01:38.430> by<00:01:38.880> polishing<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.860> wherever<00:01:40.860> as

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
smooth side by polishing it wherever as

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.399 
smooth side by polishing it wherever as
if<00:01:41.970> they're<00:01:42.150> scratching<00:01:42.659> themselves<00:01:42.840> right

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
if they're scratching themselves right

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.490 
if they're scratching themselves right
and<00:01:44.399> then<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:44.970> don't<00:01:45.180> really<00:01:45.479> need<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.200> same

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
and then you don't really need the same

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.859 
and then you don't really need the same
to<00:01:46.920> have<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.700> effect<00:01:47.820> because<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.600> effect

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
to have that effect because the effect

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.569 
to have that effect because the effect
is<00:01:49.020> just<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.409> rough<00:01:49.619> side<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.070> smooth<00:01:50.310> side

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
is just a rough side and a smooth side

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.700 
is just a rough side and a smooth side
so<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.939> bowl<00:01:51.420> always<00:01:51.869> swinging<00:01:52.259> towards<00:01:52.590> the

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
so a bowl always swinging towards the

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.520 
so a bowl always swinging towards the
rough<00:01:52.890> side<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.460> does<00:01:53.729> but<00:01:54.540> how<00:01:55.079> does<00:01:55.259> someone

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
rough side it does but how does someone

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.359 
rough side it does but how does someone
swing<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.280> baseball<00:01:56.430> then<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:58.200> relies<00:01:58.560> on<00:01:58.920> the

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
swing a baseball then that relies on the

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.740 
swing a baseball then that relies on the
Magnus<00:01:59.790> effect<00:02:00.860> normally<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.189> if<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:03.210> spin<00:02:03.540> is

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
Magnus effect normally so if the spin is

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.359 
Magnus effect normally so if the spin is
about<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.110> vertical<00:02:04.350> axis<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:05.130> allow<00:02:05.310> the

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
about a vertical axis and allow the

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.010 
about a vertical axis and allow the
curve<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.000> left<00:02:06.149> or<00:02:06.329> curve<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.869> right

curve to the left or curve to the right

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.780 
curve to the left or curve to the right
of<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.229> curveball<00:02:08.239> exactly<00:02:09.500> however<00:02:10.790> there's

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
of the curveball exactly however there's

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.700 
of the curveball exactly however there's
a<00:02:11.910> pitch<00:02:12.690> ball<00:02:12.959> known<00:02:13.170> as<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.440> sky

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
a pitch ball known as the sky

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.310 
a pitch ball known as the sky
of<00:02:13.740> all<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.910> people<00:02:15.120> don't<00:02:15.450> like<00:02:16.020> to<00:02:16.200> know

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
of all the people don't like to know

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.160 
of all the people don't like to know
about<00:02:16.590> because<00:02:16.830> it's<00:02:17.010> illegal<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:18.150> if<00:02:19.020> you're

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
about because it's illegal and if you're

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.040 
about because it's illegal and if you're
roughing<00:02:19.530> up<00:02:19.590> one<00:02:19.830> side<00:02:20.100> of<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.310> ball

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
roughing up one side of the ball

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.540 
roughing up one side of the ball
surreptitiously<00:02:22.050> without<00:02:22.320> anybody<00:02:22.890> noticing

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
surreptitiously without anybody noticing

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.710 
surreptitiously without anybody noticing
it<00:02:24.200> and<00:02:25.200> then<00:02:25.410> toss<00:02:25.800> it<00:02:26.070> it<00:02:26.820> will<00:02:27.030> curve<00:02:27.390> a<00:02:27.420> long

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
it and then toss it it will curve a long

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.540 
it and then toss it it will curve a long
way<00:02:27.900> just<00:02:28.350> like<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.920> cricket<00:02:29.250> ball<00:02:29.340> it'll

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
way just like the cricket ball it'll

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.340 
way just like the cricket ball it'll
curve<00:02:29.760> towards<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.150> rough<00:02:30.300> though<00:02:30.480> correct

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
curve towards the rough though correct

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.940 
curve towards the rough though correct
however<00:02:32.660> there's<00:02:33.660> an<00:02:33.810> effect<00:02:34.140> discovered

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
however there's an effect discovered

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.820 
however there's an effect discovered
just<00:02:34.980> this<00:02:35.460> year<00:02:36.380> which<00:02:37.380> is<00:02:37.500> fairly<00:02:37.710> obvious

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
just this year which is fairly obvious

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.550 
just this year which is fairly obvious
when<00:02:38.370> you<00:02:38.490> think<00:02:38.670> about<00:02:38.730> it<00:02:39.170> you<00:02:40.170> can<00:02:40.350> have<00:02:40.530> a

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
when you think about it you can have a

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.610 
when you think about it you can have a
smooth<00:02:40.980> patch<00:02:41.310> on<00:02:41.520> a<00:02:41.550> baseball<00:02:42.350> but<00:02:43.350> I<00:02:43.380> mean

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
smooth patch on a baseball but I mean

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.050 
smooth patch on a baseball but I mean
the<00:02:43.770> senior<00:02:44.220> seems<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.550> be<00:02:44.640> symmetric

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
the senior seems to be symmetric

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.280 
the senior seems to be symmetric
everywhere<00:02:45.390> so<00:02:45.510> how<00:02:45.660> can<00:02:45.840> you<00:02:45.930> really<00:02:46.080> have<00:02:46.260> a

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
everywhere so how can you really have a

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.400 
everywhere so how can you really have a
smooth<00:02:46.710> patch<00:02:46.950> what<00:02:47.430> you<00:02:47.580> do<00:02:47.820> there<00:02:48.240> is<00:02:48.480> to

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
smooth patch what you do there is to

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.470 
smooth patch what you do there is to
make<00:02:49.590> sure<00:02:49.620> that<00:02:49.980> access<00:02:50.550> passes<00:02:50.910> through<00:02:51.450> a

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
make sure that access passes through a

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.170 
make sure that access passes through a
spot<00:02:52.050> which<00:02:52.740> is<00:02:52.890> a<00:02:52.920> large<00:02:53.250> distance<00:02:53.790> from<00:02:53.910> the

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
spot which is a large distance from the

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.030 
spot which is a large distance from the
seam<00:02:54.420> in<00:02:54.780> other<00:02:54.960> words<00:02:55.140> right<00:02:55.530> about<00:02:55.800> there

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
seam in other words right about there

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.560 
seam in other words right about there
it's<00:02:56.220> about<00:02:56.370> one<00:02:56.640> inch<00:02:56.820> away<00:02:57.030> from<00:02:57.210> the<00:02:57.450> seam

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
it's about one inch away from the seam

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.160 
it's about one inch away from the seam
and<00:02:57.990> if<00:02:58.590> it<00:02:58.740> rotates<00:02:58.950> about<00:02:59.610> that<00:02:59.850> axis<00:03:00.300> then

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
and if it rotates about that axis then

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.630 
and if it rotates about that axis then
you've<00:03:01.350> got<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.530> big<00:03:01.830> spot<00:03:02.220> that's<00:03:02.460> always

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
you've got a big spot that's always

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.670 
you've got a big spot that's always
smooth<00:03:03.120> on<00:03:03.330> that<00:03:03.510> side<00:03:03.780> I've<00:03:04.110> got<00:03:04.260> a<00:03:04.290> smooth

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
smooth on that side I've got a smooth

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.490 
smooth on that side I've got a smooth
spot<00:03:04.950> as<00:03:05.220> opposed<00:03:05.970> to<00:03:06.150> a<00:03:06.180> rough<00:03:06.420> spot<00:03:06.690> and<00:03:06.960> so

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
spot as opposed to a rough spot and so

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.170 
spot as opposed to a rough spot and so
it<00:03:07.620> swings<00:03:07.920> away<00:03:08.190> from<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.490> smooth<00:03:08.700> bot<00:03:08.970> it

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
it swings away from the smooth bot it

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.030 
it swings away from the smooth bot it
does<00:03:09.420> and<00:03:09.720> I<00:03:09.780> can<00:03:10.050> show<00:03:10.260> you<00:03:10.290> that<00:03:10.590> in<00:03:10.800> slow

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
does and I can show you that in slow

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.800 
does and I can show you that in slow
motion<00:03:11.280> ah<00:03:11.640> so<00:03:12.060> you've<00:03:12.180> tried<00:03:12.330> to<00:03:12.510> start<00:03:12.720> with

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
motion ah so you've tried to start with

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.030 
motion ah so you've tried to start with
one<00:03:12.930> of<00:03:12.960> your<00:03:13.050> probably<00:03:13.380> firing<00:03:13.710> balls

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
one of your probably firing balls

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.680 
one of your probably firing balls
I<00:03:14.070> hope<00:03:14.340> so<00:03:14.580> that<00:03:14.850> you<00:03:15.030> can<00:03:15.150> see<00:03:15.300> the<00:03:15.420> effect

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
I hope so that you can see the effect

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.720 
I hope so that you can see the effect
more<00:03:15.870> dramatically<00:03:16.380> but<00:03:16.740> it's<00:03:16.920> also<00:03:17.130> on<00:03:17.430> film

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
more dramatically but it's also on film

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.990 
more dramatically but it's also on film
from<00:03:18.000> a<00:03:18.120> real<00:03:18.390> baseball<00:03:18.870> match<00:03:19.430> in<00:03:20.430> April<00:03:20.880> this

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
from a real baseball match in April this

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.520 
from a real baseball match in April this
year<00:03:21.060> was<00:03:21.480> filming<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:21.930> notice<00:03:22.290> for<00:03:22.440> the

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
year was filming the notice for the

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:39.150 
year was filming the notice for the
first<00:03:22.770> time<00:03:23.010> that<00:03:23.220> it's<00:03:23.370> curving<00:03:23.880> her<00:03:24.000> own<00:03:24.180> way

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.960 

so<00:03:40.160> who<00:03:40.310> was<00:03:40.520> it<00:03:40.670> who<00:03:40.850> explained<00:03:41.510> this<00:03:41.690> effect

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
so who was it who explained this effect

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.380 
so who was it who explained this effect
mate<00:03:45.250> you're<00:03:46.250> the<00:03:46.430> first<00:03:46.640> person<00:03:46.790> to<00:03:47.000> explain

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
mate you're the first person to explain

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.140 
mate you're the first person to explain
how<00:03:47.720> you<00:03:47.780> can<00:03:48.020> cause<00:03:48.319> a<00:03:48.680> baseball<00:03:49.670> to<00:03:49.819> swing<00:03:50.030> in

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
how you can cause a baseball to swing in

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.890 
how you can cause a baseball to swing in
the<00:03:50.209> opposite<00:03:50.540> direction

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
the opposite direction

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.990 
the opposite direction
I've<00:03:50.959> took<00:03:51.140> an<00:03:51.290> Aussie<00:03:51.440> to<00:03:51.739> show<00:03:52.000> Shirley

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
I've took an Aussie to show Shirley

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.699 
I've took an Aussie to show Shirley
Garvin's<00:03:53.690> how<00:03:53.900> the<00:03:53.959> how<00:03:54.230> it's<00:03:54.380> done<00:03:54.530> exactly

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
Garvin's how the how it's done exactly

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:55.870 
Garvin's how the how it's done exactly
uh-huh

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
uh-huh

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.460 
uh-huh
well<00:03:56.330> why<00:03:56.480> don't<00:03:56.540> we<00:03:56.630> yeah<00:03:56.840> why<00:03:57.110> don't<00:03:57.170> we<00:03:57.290> play

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
well why don't we yeah why don't we play

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:58.720 
well why don't we yeah why don't we play
a<00:03:57.500> bit<00:03:57.680> of<00:03:57.709> ball<00:03:57.890> with<00:03:58.069> but<00:03:58.220> with<00:03:58.310> that<00:03:58.430> thing<00:03:58.670> I

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
a bit of ball with but with that thing I

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.100 
a bit of ball with but with that thing I
don't<00:03:58.790> think<00:03:59.000> you<00:03:59.060> can<00:03:59.180> swing<00:03:59.300> that<00:03:59.420> as<00:03:59.690> much<00:03:59.840> I

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
don't think you can swing that as much I

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.729 
don't think you can swing that as much I
can't

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
can't

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.330 
can't
yeah<00:04:01.010> let's<00:04:01.790> give<00:04:01.970> it<00:04:02.030> a<00:04:02.120> shot
