00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:09.170 
I think it's same stuff for the stand

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.600 
I think it's same stuff for the stand
I've<00:00:10.170> already<00:00:10.410> done<00:00:10.530> one<00:00:10.559> side<00:00:10.980> so<00:00:11.250> let<00:00:11.370> me<00:00:11.460> say

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
I've already done one side so let me say

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.049 
I've already done one side so let me say
to<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.849> other<00:00:12.740> the<00:00:13.740> to<00:00:13.980> guide<00:00:14.519> pin<00:00:14.730> bolts

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
to the other the to guide pin bolts

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.840 
to the other the to guide pin bolts
they're<00:00:15.780> 14<00:00:16.500> mil<00:00:16.680> so<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:17.369> just<00:00:17.520> have<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.730> break

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
they're 14 mil so I just have to break

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.820 
they're 14 mil so I just have to break
those<00:00:18.029> off<00:00:18.210> it's<00:00:18.660> really<00:00:18.750> tight<00:00:19.080> spacing<00:00:19.619> so

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
those off it's really tight spacing so

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.140 
those off it's really tight spacing so
you<00:00:20.220> might<00:00:20.400> be<00:00:20.490> able<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.670> take<00:00:20.760> it<00:00:20.880> off<00:00:20.970> with<00:00:21.060> a

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
you might be able to take it off with a

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.269 
you might be able to take it off with a
regular<00:00:21.300> ratchet<00:00:22.289> with<00:00:22.439> an<00:00:22.590> extension<00:00:22.920> or<00:00:23.250> a

other<00:01:09.480> parking<00:01:09.780> brake<00:01:09.960> adjusters<00:01:10.520> so<00:01:11.520> just

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
other parking brake adjusters so just

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.690 
other parking brake adjusters so just
pop<00:01:14.340> this<00:01:14.550> thing<00:01:14.610> off<00:01:14.940> and<00:01:15.240> put<00:01:15.540> on<00:01:15.600> Newark<00:01:16.700> and

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
pop this thing off and put on Newark and

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.670 
pop this thing off and put on Newark and
I<00:01:18.450> got<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.720> stop<00:01:18.900> tech<00:01:19.110> one<00:01:19.260> so<00:01:19.410> these<00:01:19.530> are

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
I got the stop tech one so these are

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.230 
I got the stop tech one so these are
directional<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:20.220> remember<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.580> read<00:01:21.150> the

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
directional so remember to read the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.520 
directional so remember to read the
label<00:01:21.510> on<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.690> rotor<00:01:21.930> before<00:01:22.260> you<00:01:22.320> put<00:01:22.470> them

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
label on the rotor before you put them

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:30.590 
label on the rotor before you put them
in<00:01:22.650> right<00:01:22.860> side<00:01:28.760> and<00:01:29.760> the<00:01:30.030> grommet<00:01:30.360> should

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
in right side and the grommet should

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:43.370 
in right side and the grommet should
face<00:01:30.900> there<00:01:36.800> okay<00:01:37.910> I<00:01:41.600> guess<00:01:42.600> before<00:01:42.840> we<00:01:43.050> put

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
face there okay I guess before we put

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.010 
face there okay I guess before we put
the<00:01:43.680> bracket<00:01:44.160> back<00:01:44.280> on<00:01:44.490> it's<00:01:45.150> a<00:01:45.180> good<00:01:45.480> idea<00:01:45.660> to

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
the bracket back on it's a good idea to

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.460 
the bracket back on it's a good idea to
clean<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.470> all<00:01:46.590> out<00:01:46.620> and<00:01:48.020> didn't<00:01:49.020> mention<00:01:49.290> the

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
clean it all out and didn't mention the

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.620 
clean it all out and didn't mention the
video<00:01:49.560> before<00:01:49.830> but<00:01:50.250> my<00:01:50.820> guide<00:01:51.240> pins<00:01:51.450> were

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
video before but my guide pins were

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.980 
video before but my guide pins were
seized<00:01:52.140> up<00:01:52.380> inside<00:01:52.920> here<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:54.000> make<00:01:54.690> sure<00:01:54.720> when

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
seized up inside here so make sure when

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.450 
seized up inside here so make sure when
you<00:01:55.110> put<00:01:55.830> it<00:01:55.920> back<00:01:56.010> together

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
you put it back together

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.570 
you put it back together
I'll<00:01:57.090> show<00:01:57.600> them<00:01:57.720> the<00:01:57.840> next<00:01:57.960> step<00:01:58.200> but<00:01:58.530> um<00:01:58.710> the

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
I'll show them the next step but um the

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.700 
I'll show them the next step but um the
rubber<00:01:59.820> seal<00:02:00.240> or<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.990> bushing<00:02:01.290> actually

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
rubber seal or the bushing actually

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.040 
rubber seal or the bushing actually
makes<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:01.950> seal<00:02:02.220> on<00:02:02.400> here<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.630> bolt<00:02:03.810> and

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
makes a seal on here and the bolt and

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.580 
makes a seal on here and the bolt and
remember<00:02:05.010> to<00:02:05.130> add<00:02:05.340> some<00:02:05.670> caliper<00:02:06.120> Lube<00:02:06.590> there

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
remember to add some caliper Lube there

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.380 
remember to add some caliper Lube there
and<00:02:07.920> clean<00:02:08.790> up<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.030> tracks

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
and clean up the tracks

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
okay so I'll continue after cleaning up

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.120 
okay so I'll continue after cleaning up
okay<00:02:12.959> so<00:02:13.260> after<00:02:13.760> you<00:02:14.760> repack<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.930> die<00:02:16.890> pins

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
okay so after you repack the die pins

bolts<00:02:23.160> down<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.580> 70<00:02:23.850> foot<00:02:24.000> pounds<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:24.830> the

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
bolts down to 70 foot pounds and the

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.390 
bolts down to 70 foot pounds and the
guide<00:02:26.010> pins<00:02:26.250> must<00:02:26.550> be<00:02:26.670> torqued<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:28.220> 36<00:02:29.220> foot

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
guide pins must be torqued to 36 foot

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.270 
guide pins must be torqued to 36 foot
pounds<00:02:29.760> um<00:02:30.080> remember<00:02:31.080> to<00:02:31.230> put<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.440> bead<00:02:32.100> of

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
pounds um remember to put a bead of

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.280 
pounds um remember to put a bead of
grease<00:02:32.610> on<00:02:32.850> just<00:02:33.120> because<00:02:33.239> breaking<00:02:34.080> them

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
grease on just because breaking them

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.640 
grease on just because breaking them
down<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:34.650> next<00:02:34.860> time<00:02:34.950> would<00:02:35.100> be<00:02:35.280> a<00:02:35.430> lot<00:02:36.000> easier

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
down the next time would be a lot easier

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.420 
down the next time would be a lot easier
so<00:02:37.650> after<00:02:37.950> I've<00:02:38.070> torqued<00:02:38.370> this<00:02:38.550> side<00:02:39.300> down

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
so after I've torqued this side down

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.280 
so after I've torqued this side down
I'll<00:02:41.430> get<00:02:41.580> to<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.760> last<00:02:42.120> step<00:02:42.360> so<00:02:43.020> when

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
I'll get to the last step so when

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.590 
I'll get to the last step so when
putting<00:02:43.470> everything<00:02:43.739> back<00:02:43.950> together<00:02:44.510> thing<00:02:45.510> I

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
putting everything back together thing I

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.020 
putting everything back together thing I
forgot<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.840> mention<00:02:45.989> earlier<00:02:46.400> when<00:02:47.400> taking<00:02:47.970> it

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
forgot to mention earlier when taking it

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.960 
forgot to mention earlier when taking it
apart<00:02:48.360> I<00:02:48.450> broke<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:49.110> top<00:02:49.500> caliper<00:02:50.400> bolt<00:02:50.610> first

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
apart I broke the top caliper bolt first

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.760 
apart I broke the top caliper bolt first
and<00:02:51.360> I<00:02:51.570> found<00:02:51.840> like<00:02:51.959> let<00:02:52.260> this<00:02:52.350> thing<00:02:52.530> swing

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
and I found like let this thing swing

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.710 
and I found like let this thing swing
down<00:02:52.950> so<00:02:54.739> that's<00:02:55.850> this<00:02:56.850> bottom<00:02:57.300> over<00:02:57.480> here<00:02:57.510> as

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
down so that's this bottom over here as

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.000 
down so that's this bottom over here as
you<00:02:57.840> can<00:02:57.870> see<00:02:58.080> it's<00:02:58.290> all<00:02:58.440> scratched<00:02:58.680> up<00:02:58.830> now

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
you can see it's all scratched up now

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.340 
you can see it's all scratched up now
trying<00:03:00.000> to<00:03:00.030> remove<00:03:00.270> the<00:03:00.450> lower<00:03:00.630> Calliphora

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
trying to remove the lower Calliphora

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.699 
trying to remove the lower Calliphora
let's<00:03:01.620> take<00:03:01.770> off<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.250> piston<00:03:03.470> it's<00:03:04.470> kind<00:03:04.620> of<00:03:04.650> a

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
let's take off the piston it's kind of a

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.610 
let's take off the piston it's kind of a
problem<00:03:04.890> so<00:03:05.190> I<00:03:05.850> improvise<00:03:06.720> by<00:03:06.930> using<00:03:07.170> a<00:03:07.290> second

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
problem so I improvise by using a second

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.020 
problem so I improvise by using a second
jack<00:03:08.330> to<00:03:09.330> lift<00:03:09.360> up<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:10.220> lower<00:03:11.220> control<00:03:11.820> arm

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
jack to lift up the lower control arm

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.570 
jack to lift up the lower control arm
area<00:03:12.330> I<00:03:12.360> guess<00:03:12.540> so<00:03:13.350> to<00:03:13.500> slip<00:03:14.070> this<00:03:14.220> thing<00:03:14.430> in

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
area I guess so to slip this thing in

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.970 
area I guess so to slip this thing in
makes<00:03:15.030> it<00:03:15.150> a<00:03:15.180> lot<00:03:15.269> easier<00:03:15.660> so<00:03:16.380> after<00:03:16.770> you've

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
makes it a lot easier so after you've

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.920 
makes it a lot easier so after you've
regressed<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:18.120> guide<00:03:18.540> pins<00:03:18.840> and<00:03:20.600> the<00:03:21.600> fact

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
regressed the guide pins and the fact

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.610 
regressed the guide pins and the fact
the<00:03:21.989> pads<00:03:22.579> I<00:03:23.659> got<00:03:24.659> stopped<00:03:24.989> tech<00:03:25.170> pad<00:03:25.349> so<00:03:25.500> they

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
the pads I got stopped tech pad so they

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.319 
the pads I got stopped tech pad so they
came<00:03:25.769> with<00:03:25.920> new<00:03:26.069> shins<00:03:26.340> so<00:03:26.790> I<00:03:26.819> didn't<00:03:27.180> have<00:03:27.269> to

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
came with new shins so I didn't have to

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.170 
came with new shins so I didn't have to
reuse<00:03:27.450> my<00:03:27.719> old<00:03:27.840> ones<00:03:28.579> anyways<00:03:29.579> remember<00:03:29.730> the

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
reuse my old ones anyways remember the

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.110 
reuse my old ones anyways remember the
inner<00:03:30.780> pad<00:03:31.079> has<00:03:31.590> to<00:03:31.859> have<00:03:31.950> this<00:03:32.819> little<00:03:33.000> thing

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
inner pad has to have this little thing

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.490 
inner pad has to have this little thing
pointing<00:03:33.659> upward<00:03:35.420> and<00:03:36.420> just<00:03:37.049> snaps<00:03:37.319> into

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
pointing upward and just snaps into

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.750 
pointing upward and just snaps into
place<00:03:39.739> pushing<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:40.829> piston<00:03:40.980> I've<00:03:41.400> already

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
place pushing the piston I've already

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.839 
place pushing the piston I've already
done<00:03:41.909> mine<00:03:42.120> just<00:03:42.450> use<00:03:43.370> an<00:03:44.370> old<00:03:44.489> brake<00:03:44.819> pad<00:03:45.060> and

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849 
done mine just use an old brake pad and

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:49.759 
done mine just use an old brake pad and
see<00:03:47.849> plan<00:03:48.090> and<00:03:48.450> just<00:03:48.480> remember<00:03:49.079> to<00:03:49.170> rotate<00:03:49.650> it

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
see plan and just remember to rotate it

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:50.270 
see plan and just remember to rotate it
in<00:03:49.829> slowly

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
in slowly

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.800 
in slowly
I<00:03:52.069> left<00:03:53.069> my<00:03:53.250> brake<00:03:53.519> reservoir<00:03:53.700> cap<00:03:54.120> on<00:03:54.299> so<00:03:54.599> long

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
I left my brake reservoir cap on so long

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.659 
I left my brake reservoir cap on so long
as<00:03:55.079> long<00:03:55.290> as<00:03:55.409> you<00:03:55.470> go<00:03:55.530> slowly<00:03:55.769> Asian<00:03:56.099> like<00:03:56.370> pour

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:56.669 
as long as you go slowly Asian like pour

00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:00.199 
as long as you go slowly Asian like pour
out<00:03:56.790> and<00:03:57.569> should<00:03:58.019> slide<00:03:58.349> back<00:03:58.530> in<00:03:58.709> so<00:03:59.669> remember

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
out and should slide back in so remember

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.030 
out and should slide back in so remember
once<00:04:00.389> you<00:04:00.480> put<00:04:00.689> it<00:04:00.780> in<00:04:00.870> remember<00:04:01.319> to<00:04:01.470> push<00:04:01.889> it

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
once you put it in remember to push it

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.110 
once you put it in remember to push it
in<00:04:02.159> and<00:04:02.310> out<00:04:02.430> a<00:04:02.459> bit<00:04:04.159> once<00:04:05.159> you<00:04:05.220> put<00:04:05.489> it<00:04:05.579> on<00:04:05.669> just

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
in and out a bit once you put it on just

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.020 
in and out a bit once you put it on just
to<00:04:06.209> make<00:04:06.359> sure<00:04:06.480> the<00:04:06.840> loops<00:04:07.709> spread<00:04:08.159> evenly<00:04:08.519> in

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
to make sure the loops spread evenly in

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.459 
to make sure the loops spread evenly in
a<00:04:09.810> piston<00:04:10.469> and<00:04:10.680> remember<00:04:11.010> to<00:04:11.129> torque<00:04:11.370> the

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:12.469 
a piston and remember to torque the

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:17.140 
a piston and remember to torque the
guide<00:04:13.469> pins<00:04:13.709> down<00:04:13.919> to<00:04:14.219> 36<00:04:14.669> foot<00:04:14.909> pounds<00:04:15.209> and

guide pins down to 36 foot pounds and

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.659 
guide pins down to 36 foot pounds and
guess<00:04:18.150> we'll<00:04:18.509> go<00:04:18.750> to<00:04:18.810> the<00:04:18.870> next<00:04:19.049> step<00:04:19.459> okay<00:04:20.459> and

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
guess we'll go to the next step okay and

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.450 
guess we'll go to the next step okay and
remember<00:04:21.030> to<00:04:21.299> tighten<00:04:21.810> the<00:04:22.259> wheels<00:04:23.160> down<00:04:23.280> to

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
remember to tighten the wheels down to

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.210 
remember to tighten the wheels down to
84<00:04:23.789> pounds<00:04:24.110> so<00:04:25.110> for<00:04:25.530> the<00:04:25.590> front<00:04:25.889> after<00:04:26.130> you've

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
84 pounds so for the front after you've

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.029 
84 pounds so for the front after you've
breaking<00:04:26.520> the<00:04:26.580> wheels<00:04:26.729> down<00:04:27.620> do<00:04:28.620> the<00:04:28.800> two

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
breaking the wheels down do the two

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:32.149 
breaking the wheels down do the two
guide<00:04:29.639> pins<00:04:29.880> top<00:04:30.389> and<00:04:30.570> bottom<00:04:30.870> they<00:04:31.530> are<00:04:31.740> the

guide pins top and bottom they are the

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:34.700 
guide pins top and bottom they are the
same<00:04:32.310> as<00:04:32.430> the<00:04:32.520> back<00:04:32.699> of<00:04:32.970> 14<00:04:33.360> mil<00:04:33.539> I've<00:04:34.530> already

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
same as the back of 14 mil I've already

was just wiggle Oh next up is to break
down<00:05:05.630> the<00:05:06.630> bolts<00:05:07.349> at<00:05:07.440> the<00:05:07.470> back<00:05:07.680> here<00:05:07.949> for<00:05:08.490> the

these are torqued down to 115
foot-pounds<00:05:20.400> I<00:05:20.460> think<00:05:20.639> so

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
foot-pounds I think so

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.999 
foot-pounds I think so
gonna<00:05:21.930> need<00:05:22.050> a<00:05:22.110> breaker<00:05:22.320> bar<00:05:22.409> for<00:05:22.710> sure<00:05:22.830> for

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:23.009 
gonna need a breaker bar for sure for

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:25.850 
gonna need a breaker bar for sure for
that<00:05:23.120> so<00:05:24.120> get<00:05:24.419> back<00:05:24.599> to<00:05:24.750> him<00:05:24.840> next<00:05:24.990> step<00:05:25.199> okay

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
that so get back to him next step okay

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.589 
that so get back to him next step okay
so<00:05:25.919> after<00:05:26.250> you've<00:05:26.520> broken<00:05:26.639> down<00:05:26.940> the<00:05:28.490> caliper

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:29.599 
so after you've broken down the caliper

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:33.690 
so after you've broken down the caliper
bracket<00:05:30.599> bolts<00:05:30.870> there<00:05:31.229> are<00:05:31.380> 22<00:05:31.770> Mills

life easier if I didn't mention it
before<00:05:53.510> you<00:05:53.870> just<00:05:53.990> use<00:05:54.110> a<00:05:54.140> wire<00:05:54.320> brush<00:05:57.610> hook<00:05:58.610> it

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:58.760 
before you just use a wire brush hook it

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:04.150 
before you just use a wire brush hook it
comes<00:05:58.910> off<00:05:59.060> like<00:05:59.300> so<00:06:01.870> and<00:06:02.870> just<00:06:02.950> like<00:06:03.950> before

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 
comes off like so and just like before

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:12.030 
comes off like so and just like before
we<00:06:04.880> have<00:06:09.520> stopped<00:06:10.520> that<00:06:10.760> directional<00:06:11.390> rotors

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:12.040 
we have stopped that directional rotors

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.470 
we have stopped that directional rotors
time<00:06:13.040> to<00:06:13.190> refill<00:06:13.640> those<00:06:13.760> walnutrij

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:14.480 
time to refill those walnutrij

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.480 
time to refill those walnutrij
times<00:06:15.140> over<00:06:17.470> and<00:06:18.470> reinstall<00:06:19.100> it<00:06:19.130> they're

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:19.490 
times over and reinstall it they're

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.960 
times over and reinstall it they're
supposed<00:06:19.730> to<00:06:19.760> be<00:06:20.410> a<00:06:21.410> bolt<00:06:22.400> over<00:06:22.550> here<00:06:22.760> that<00:06:22.910> you

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:22.970 
supposed to be a bolt over here that you

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:24.850 
supposed to be a bolt over here that you
can<00:06:23.090> do<00:06:23.210> in<00:06:23.390> case<00:06:23.570> of<00:06:23.600> the<00:06:24.170> rotor<00:06:24.380> seized<00:06:24.680> on

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:24.860 
can do in case of the rotor seized on

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.040 
can do in case of the rotor seized on
just<00:06:25.640> looking<00:06:25.790> where<00:06:26.030> the<00:06:26.270> excess<00:06:26.570> grease<00:06:26.840> is

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.050 
just looking where the excess grease is

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:33.310 
just looking where the excess grease is
or<00:06:27.790> anything<00:06:28.790> else<00:06:28.940> shouldn't<00:06:29.900> matter<00:06:32.320> and

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:33.320 
or anything else shouldn't matter and

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.020 
or anything else shouldn't matter and
just<00:06:33.770> reverse<00:06:34.040> it<00:06:34.070> so<00:06:34.430> after<00:06:34.640> I've<00:06:34.820> cleaned

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:35.030 
just reverse it so after I've cleaned

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.120 
just reverse it so after I've cleaned
this<00:06:35.150> we'll<00:06:35.360> continue<00:06:35.570> on<00:06:35.900> okay<00:06:36.710> so<00:06:37.010> after

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.130 
this we'll continue on okay so after

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.300 
this we'll continue on okay so after
you've<00:06:37.430> reached<00:06:37.670> everything<00:06:38.860> from<00:06:39.860> to<00:06:40.010> add<00:06:40.250> a

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:40.310 
you've reached everything from to add a

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.270 
you've reached everything from to add a
little<00:06:40.520> drop<00:06:40.790> of<00:06:41.110> Lube<00:06:42.110> on<00:06:42.350> bolt<00:06:42.650> just<00:06:43.190> a

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280 
little drop of Lube on bolt just a

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.800 
little drop of Lube on bolt just a
little<00:06:43.490> taking<00:06:43.730> it<00:06:43.790> apart<00:06:44.030> next<00:06:44.390> one<00:06:44.510> will<00:06:44.690> be

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:44.810 
little taking it apart next one will be

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.010 
little taking it apart next one will be
a<00:06:44.840> lot<00:06:45.020> easier<00:06:45.050> and<00:06:46.300> torque<00:06:47.300> those<00:06:47.540> bracket

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.020 
a lot easier and torque those bracket

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:56.530 
a lot easier and torque those bracket
bolts<00:06:48.290> down<00:06:48.470> to<00:06:49.360> 115<00:06:50.360> foot<00:06:50.540> pounds<00:06:53.530> and<00:06:55.540> before

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:56.540 
bolts down to 115 foot pounds and before

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.350 
bolts down to 115 foot pounds and before
we<00:06:56.630> get<00:06:56.750> it<00:06:57.080> from<00:06:57.620> to<00:06:57.920> put<00:06:58.130> any<00:06:58.700> pads<00:06:58.970> in<00:06:59.150> place

00:06:59.350 --> 00:06:59.360 
we get it from to put any pads in place

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.350 
we get it from to put any pads in place
so<00:06:59.900> if<00:07:00.050> the<00:07:00.170> clipped<00:07:00.410> side<00:07:00.650> a<00:07:01.180> little<00:07:02.180> tab
