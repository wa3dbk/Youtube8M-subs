00:00:01.509 --> 00:00:04.860
 until November 4 in the exhibition hall 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.770
 the civic center rigoberta menchú henos we found an exhibition that 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.139
 just opened 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:15.500
 the author pedro varela gives the title the emotion of digital art 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.039
 which represents this exhibition 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:20.370
 what does it consist of 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.370
 it consists does not do it through the time to digest 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:28.130
 Experiencing the leader in different techniques and good we are in the era 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.919
 digital 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.109
 and I enter that digital age 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.270
 through 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.780
 the mixed entity 14 of work and others built getting into this event in 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.350
 this new tool that does not stop being over time as 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.960
 support 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.490
 it is feared that I have been fighting for time 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.410
 It's the first time you put yourself in Leganés 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.770
 the first time the 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.240
 The truth is that I do not know exactly how they have been interested in the work 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.960
 which his 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.290
 vuoso in some fair or not 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.790
 in some position 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.030
 Esteban Vigo 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.080
 the media must come out intense 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.930
 the tiger's dt is a car 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.140
 madrid gold or professionally dedicate to this 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.050
 molo alternate 1 with some workers and gas 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.670
 right now 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.800
 he did it longer because he is also much more liberated so far 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.950
 the doctor like any his work for many years this 9-3 charts 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.890
 and then it comes 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.490
 in architecture with 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.870
 architecture studies and clean decoration 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.870
 percent in possible graphic arts 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.490
 has evolved as a promoter of the graphic arts was very artisanal 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.530
 It was all very manual very craftsman but over time with the digital era 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.530
 Well, it has also entered and everyone has converted 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.440
 through time 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.590
 I have been evolving different has been going through different stages and good 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.040
 regardless that I am now doing this type of work this does not 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.159
 born by itself but coming from lying down a projection is decided 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.219
 especially 

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:11.309
 as much influenced by him by the color 

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:14.409
 graphic arts and by delineation 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.179
 although the architecture 

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:20.290
 in how many hours is that why here in the room roberto macho 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.290
 cusack and 12 hours there are three formats 

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:28.499
 the 95 by 95 1 45 by 1 45 and 1 20 by 

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:31.719
 the 18 1 do not count and not like 18 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:35.109
 what is the technique of digital art 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:37.429
 The technique 

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:42.069
 I really went to the finish line, I did the parades painting by hand but with a 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:43.049
 mouse 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.389
 what I do is get in 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:48.709
 put on the screen for me is still curious 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.709
 and he used that white screen 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.049
 like a canvas like 10m 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.870
 through an act or through the graphic pizza coyol limping colors 

00:02:58.649 --> 00:03:02.159
 I'm manipulating, encouraging very controversial textures similar 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.829
 they passed of goods is not a subject of research and air 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.479
 I idibi deepening in them 

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:13.479
 the hours shown here are for sale 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.810
 I think if God does not directly but 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.260
 oo for what I understand if there is someone who is interested in that network go 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.739
 to power and also 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.369
 my contact so that it can be done but I do not know if directly with his people 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.689
 and good or you have some pretension 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:33.139
 on special or merely aesthetic with this position 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.499
 in none I have 

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:40.309
 my pretension is to continue working 

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:44.469
 I kept surprising that what I care to surprise me Polish paint 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:48.779
 and in the end it is an inner journey that you tubes traveling, you go getting 

00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:49.939
 you are learning yvasa 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:53.079
 the evolution in time meant 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:54.159
 portillo name 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:55.749
 I put ends but yes 

00:03:55.749 --> 00:03:57.099
 What I do is 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:59.169
 not stop working 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:03.119
 in an interview that I did a long time ago I also started a little bit 

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:04.109
 north 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:07.339
 I also do not know what makes me think, why or why 

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:08.989
 but since I was a child 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:12.879
 he did not stop painting what they wanted in size between the car and painting 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:15.489
 but not as an end but 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:19.879
 by the need for money the recognition towards the interior does not 

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:21.079
 oneself 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.350
 good post that have a lot of success here in Leganés and if they want to send 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:25.520
 some message to 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.979
 aa neighbors who do not see 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:30.729
 day here you have position I think it's a position given that it's a 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.849
 very new technology 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:36.860
 Well, I think it's very didactic especially for the children who are the 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.180
 that really band and manipulating everything is more this kind of tools and I 

00:04:41.179 --> 00:04:43.639
 I think I can open a little 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:45.379
 the posibilities 

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:48.889
 environment where you can eat how you can and it's easy where you 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:51.599
 can come with being with this tool 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:54.599
 something very many thanks to you been them 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:09.309
