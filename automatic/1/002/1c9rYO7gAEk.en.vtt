00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
the side steps but not very easily and

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.070 
the side steps but not very easily and
they're<00:01:17.730> usually<00:01:17.880> busy<00:01:18.390> with<00:01:18.540> other<00:01:18.660> people

front and peek out on the side of the
elevator<00:01:28.050> room<00:01:28.620> and<00:01:29.030> you'll<00:01:30.030> usually<00:01:30.300> drop

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
elevator room and you'll usually drop

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.750 
elevator room and you'll usually drop
them<00:01:30.900> because<00:01:31.170> what<00:01:32.010> they<00:01:32.160> see<00:01:32.220> when<00:01:32.460> they

turn that corner is probably about

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:35.960 
turn that corner is probably about
twenty<00:01:35.010> to<00:01:35.130> thirty<00:01:35.369> percent<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.820> your<00:01:35.910> body

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
twenty to thirty percent of your body

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.640 
twenty to thirty percent of your body
because<00:01:36.540> you're<00:01:36.690> behind<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:37.020> desk<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:37.560> the

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
because you're behind that desk in the

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.170 
because you're behind that desk in the
office<00:01:37.710> like<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.460> saw<00:01:38.640> in<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.790> start<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.150> the

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
office like you saw in the start of the

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.620 
office like you saw in the start of the
video<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:40.070> what<00:01:41.070> do<00:01:41.160> you<00:01:41.250> see<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.790> one<00:01:42.390> hundred

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
video and what do you see is one hundred

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.630 
video and what do you see is one hundred
percent<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:43.380> their<00:01:43.530> body<00:01:43.800> as<00:01:44.100> they<00:01:44.250> peek<00:01:44.460> out

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
percent of their body as they peek out

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.600 
percent of their body as they peek out
so<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.540> put<00:01:45.990> your<00:01:46.170> little<00:01:46.710> aiming<00:01:47.100> reticle<00:01:47.430> on

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
so you put your little aiming reticle on

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.950 
so you put your little aiming reticle on
them<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:47.940> start<00:01:48.180> shooting<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.780> you're

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
them and start shooting and you're

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.350 
them and start shooting and you're
hitting<00:01:49.259> even<00:01:50.009> heads<00:01:50.430> body<00:01:50.790> whatever<00:01:51.060> you're

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
hitting even heads body whatever you're

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.210 
hitting even heads body whatever you're
hitting<00:01:51.630> them<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:52.259> they've<00:01:52.470> got<00:01:52.680> this<00:01:52.950> little

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
hitting them and they've got this little

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.010 
hitting them and they've got this little
twenty<00:01:53.670> thirty<00:01:53.880> percent<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.330> your<00:01:54.420> body<00:01:54.479> maybe

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
twenty thirty percent of your body maybe

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.800 
twenty thirty percent of your body maybe
to<00:01:55.619> shoot<00:01:55.890> at<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.490> so<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.210> really<00:01:57.570> have<00:01:57.600> the

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
to shoot at and so you really have the

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.719 
to shoot at and so you really have the
advantage<00:01:58.200> on<00:01:58.350> them<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:59.040> what<00:01:59.220> people<00:01:59.520> really

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
advantage on them and what people really

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.719 
advantage on them and what people really
should<00:02:00.300> realize<00:02:00.690> in<00:02:00.899> this<00:02:01.050> game<00:02:01.259> is<00:02:01.560> that<00:02:01.729> it's

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
should realize in this game is that it's

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.499 
should realize in this game is that it's
not<00:02:03.060> about<00:02:03.890> just<00:02:04.890> pushing<00:02:05.399> it's<00:02:06.210> about

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
not about just pushing it's about

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.830 
not about just pushing it's about
pushing<00:02:06.869> smart<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:08.300> we<00:02:09.300> get<00:02:09.540> really

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
pushing smart and we get really

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.390 
pushing smart and we get really
impatient<00:02:09.989> in<00:02:10.440> this<00:02:10.560> game<00:02:10.739> sometimes<00:02:11.190> I<00:02:11.340> know

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
impatient in this game sometimes I know

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.610 
impatient in this game sometimes I know
I<00:02:11.520> do<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.090> just<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.540> just<00:02:12.570> want<00:02:12.959> to<00:02:13.020> roll

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
I do and I just I just want to roll

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.650 
I do and I just I just want to roll
through<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.130> get<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.400> flags<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:15.060> just<00:02:15.510> push

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
through and get the flags and just push

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.640 
through and get the flags and just push
through<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:15.900> it's<00:02:16.110> something<00:02:16.320> I've<00:02:16.380> had<00:02:16.530> to

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
through and it's something I've had to

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.009 
through and it's something I've had to
discipline<00:02:17.070> myself<00:02:17.250> in<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:18.239> not<00:02:18.780> just

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
discipline myself in and not just

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.360 
discipline myself in and not just
running<00:02:19.260> through<00:02:19.290> to<00:02:19.530> get<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.739> flag<00:02:19.950> I<00:02:20.190> want
