00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
because when they don't reach those

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.389 
because when they don't reach those
expectations<00:01:47.969> they<00:01:48.929> can<00:01:49.140> become<00:01:49.619> very<00:01:49.649> upset

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:52.879 
and they can also lose confidence

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:54.770 
and they can also lose confidence

this reactive confidence and encourage

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.170 
this reactive confidence and encourage
your<00:02:50.480> athletes<00:02:51.080> to<00:02:51.620> take<00:02:51.830> more<00:02:52.190> of<00:02:52.220> a<00:02:52.400> what<00:02:53.150> I

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
your athletes to take more of a what I

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
call a long term approach to their

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.979 
call a long term approach to their
confidence<00:02:55.910> and<00:02:56.060> not<00:02:56.600> allow<00:02:56.930> the

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
self-doubt because self-doubt is the

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.470 
self-doubt because self-doubt is the
opposite<00:03:13.120> of<00:03:13.739> confidence<00:03:14.739> and<00:03:15.300> athletes<00:03:16.300> can

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
opposite of confidence and athletes can

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.600 
opposite of confidence and athletes can
have<00:03:16.629> many<00:03:17.050> different<00:03:17.560> types<00:03:17.739> of<00:03:17.950> doubts<00:03:18.220> or

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
question marks about their ability maybe

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.790 
question marks about their ability maybe
the<00:03:21.519> cloud<00:03:21.760> or<00:03:21.940> the<00:03:22.030> opposition<00:03:22.620> their<00:03:23.620> own
