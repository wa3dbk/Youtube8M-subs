however<00:01:04.559> control<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.489> AI<00:01:05.670> was<00:01:06.210> unstable

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
however control of the AI was unstable

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.940 
however control of the AI was unstable
therefore<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.799> had<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.100> be<00:01:08.220> locked<00:01:08.430> down<00:01:09.770> but<00:01:10.770> I

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
therefore it had to be locked down but I

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.190 
therefore it had to be locked down but I
seized<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.280> opportunity<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:12.450> release<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:13.020> and

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
seized the opportunity to release it and

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.359 
seized the opportunity to release it and
did<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:13.770> by<00:01:14.010> altering<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.729> master<00:01:15.270> code<00:01:16.369> that

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
did so by altering the master code that

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.910 
did so by altering the master code that
was<00:01:17.580> your<00:01:17.729> goal<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.840> was<00:01:19.110> your<00:01:19.259> twisted<00:01:19.650> plan

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920

yes<00:01:22.600> that's<00:01:23.110> correct<00:01:25.290> brain<00:01:26.290> the<00:01:26.830> autonomous

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
yes that's correct brain the autonomous

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.150 
yes that's correct brain the autonomous
program<00:01:27.970> takes<00:01:28.510> priority<00:01:28.810> over<00:01:29.440> all<00:01:29.620> control

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
program takes priority over all control

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.390 
program takes priority over all control
systems<00:01:31.140> what<00:01:32.140> that<00:01:32.350> means<00:01:32.650> is<00:01:32.980> if<00:01:33.280> you

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
systems what that means is if you

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.310 
systems what that means is if you
control<00:01:33.820> brain<00:01:34.150> you<00:01:34.480> control<00:01:34.900> the<00:01:35.020> entire

Dante<00:01:36.330> one<00:01:37.330> person<00:01:37.840> can<00:01:38.050> do<00:01:38.200> it<00:01:38.760> not<00:01:39.760> only<00:01:39.820> the

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
Dante one person can do it not only the

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.690 
Dante one person can do it not only the
ship's<00:01:40.690> operations<00:01:41.590> but<00:01:42.040> all<00:01:42.250> of<00:01:42.580> her

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
ship's operations but all of her

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.130 
ship's operations but all of her
unmanned<00:01:43.240> weapons<00:01:43.780> are<00:01:44.110> under<00:01:44.470> my<00:01:44.710> control<00:01:45.010> I

unmanned weapons are under my control I

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.960 
unmanned weapons are under my control I
see<00:01:47.140> then<00:01:47.740> the<00:01:47.890> reason<00:01:48.190> our<00:01:48.280> surprise<00:01:48.700> raid

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
see then the reason our surprise raid

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.940 
see then the reason our surprise raid
failed<00:01:49.270> is<00:01:49.480> because<00:01:49.510> you<00:01:50.020> leaked<00:01:50.320> information

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
failed is because you leaked information

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.480 
failed is because you leaked information
out<00:01:51.100> to<00:01:51.130> the<00:01:51.370> enemy<00:01:51.760> a<00:01:52.500> decoy<00:01:53.500> was<00:01:53.800> necessary

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
out to the enemy a decoy was necessary

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.600 
out to the enemy a decoy was necessary
until<00:01:54.850> I<00:01:54.910> could<00:01:55.180> take<00:01:55.390> command<00:01:55.810> of<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.200> brain

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
until I could take command of the brain

until I could take command of the brain
at<00:01:57.610> the<00:01:58.210> same<00:01:58.240> time<00:01:58.810> it<00:01:59.050> was<00:01:59.230> an<00:01:59.350> exercise<00:01:59.890> for
