wear safety glasses for something like

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.619 
wear safety glasses for something like
this<00:02:13.040> now<00:02:13.790> whose<00:02:13.940> turn<00:02:14.090> away<00:02:14.239> from<00:02:14.390> yourself

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
now the next thing you do is you mark up

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.250 
now the next thing you do is you mark up
your<00:02:30.030> four<00:02:30.180> pieces<00:02:30.420> of<00:02:30.690> wood<00:02:31.970> is<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.260> hand

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
your four pieces of wood is the hand

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.480 
your four pieces of wood is the hand
guard<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:36.000> blade<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:37.350> sheath<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:37.920> all<00:02:38.370> the

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
guard the blade the sheath and all the

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.699 
guard the blade the sheath and all the
docks<00:02:38.700> bar<00:02:39.060> all<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.570> dark<00:02:40.020> areas<00:02:40.470> are<00:02:40.560> what's

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
docks bar all the dark areas are what's

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:41.930 
docks bar all the dark areas are what's
going<00:02:40.740> to<00:02:40.860> be<00:02:40.950> cut<00:02:41.130> away<00:02:41.220> when<00:02:41.550> I<00:02:41.580> Widow<00:02:41.760> look

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
going to be cut away when I Widow look

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.940 
going to be cut away when I Widow look
and<00:02:42.120> this<00:02:42.690> is<00:02:42.750> actually<00:02:43.500> doesn't<00:02:43.709> go<00:02:43.770> all<00:02:43.860> the

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
and this is actually doesn't go all the

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.800 
and this is actually doesn't go all the
way<00:02:43.980> through<00:02:44.310> this<00:02:44.580> is<00:02:44.760> going<00:02:45.120> to<00:02:45.209> be<00:02:45.330> a<00:02:45.360> narrow

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
way through this is going to be a narrow

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.620 
way through this is going to be a narrow
channel<00:02:45.930> that<00:02:46.590> I<00:02:46.620> just<00:02:46.890> would<00:02:47.430> allow<00:02:47.670> on<00:02:48.300> both

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
channel that I just would allow on both

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.270 
channel that I just would allow on both
of<00:02:48.840> them<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.110> same<00:02:49.290> exact<00:02:49.620> thing<00:02:49.800> on<00:02:49.890> both<00:02:50.070> of

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
of them the same exact thing on both of

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.740 
of them the same exact thing on both of
them<00:02:50.400> so<00:02:50.820> when<00:02:50.970> I<00:02:51.000> whittle<00:02:51.239> it<00:02:51.300> out<00:02:51.450> you<00:02:51.600> can

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
them so when I whittle it out you can

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.380 
them so when I whittle it out you can
fit<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:51.989> blade<00:02:52.200> and<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:53.040> but<00:02:53.880> this<00:02:54.000> will<00:02:54.209> all

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
fit the blade and and but this will all

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.780 
fit the blade and and but this will all
cut<00:02:54.900> all<00:02:55.050> of<00:02:55.080> this<00:02:55.320> off<00:02:55.530> so<00:02:56.040> what<00:02:56.250> happens<00:02:56.550> is

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
cut all of this off so what happens is

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.160 
cut all of this off so what happens is
when<00:02:57.239> you<00:02:57.620> put<00:02:58.620> these<00:02:58.739> two<00:02:59.010> together<00:03:00.020> it<00:03:01.020> will

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
when you put these two together it will

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.890 
when you put these two together it will
cause<00:03:01.350> a<00:03:01.380> channel<00:03:02.070> here<00:03:02.100> so<00:03:02.700> you<00:03:03.540> can<00:03:03.690> fit<00:03:03.870> your

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
cause a channel here so you can fit your

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.990 
cause a channel here so you can fit your
blade<00:03:04.170> into<00:03:04.410> and<00:03:04.800> what<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:05.640> best<00:03:05.760> thing<00:03:05.940> you

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
blade into and what the best thing you

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.520 
blade into and what the best thing you
should<00:03:06.120> do<00:03:06.180> about<00:03:06.270> that<00:03:06.360> is<00:03:06.690> is<00:03:07.230> wait<00:03:07.500> until

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
should do about that is is wait until

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.050 
should do about that is is wait until
you've<00:03:07.860> carved<00:03:08.100> your<00:03:08.250> blade<00:03:08.459> so<00:03:08.730> you<00:03:08.760> have<00:03:09.030> a

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
you've carved your blade so you have a

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.120 
you've carved your blade so you have a
nice<00:03:09.320> template<00:03:10.320> you<00:03:10.440> can<00:03:10.560> put<00:03:10.709> on<00:03:10.830> there<00:03:11.100> and

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
nice template you can put on there and

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.760 
nice template you can put on there and
slowly<00:03:11.820> carve<00:03:12.209> it<00:03:12.390> to<00:03:12.600> fit<00:03:12.780> right<00:03:12.930> see<00:03:13.709> you

thick<00:03:47.880> but<00:03:48.450> I<00:03:48.480> carved<00:03:48.870> out<00:03:49.019> the<00:03:49.140> shape<00:03:49.380> of<00:03:49.560> the

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
thick but I carved out the shape of the

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.800 
thick but I carved out the shape of the
blade<00:03:49.799> and<00:03:50.310> now<00:03:50.850> next<00:03:51.150> I'm<00:03:51.360> going<00:03:51.510> to<00:03:51.630> start

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
blade and now next I'm going to start

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.330 
blade and now next I'm going to start
carving<00:03:52.019> it<00:03:52.200> this<00:03:52.350> way<00:03:52.590> to<00:03:52.829> make<00:03:52.950> it<00:03:53.100> thinner

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
carving it this way to make it thinner

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.660 
carving it this way to make it thinner
and<00:03:53.790> you<00:03:54.000> can<00:03:54.120> see<00:03:54.829> that<00:03:55.829> this<00:03:56.100> gets<00:03:56.430> this

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
and you can see that this gets this

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.280 
and you can see that this gets this
blade<00:03:56.940> gets<00:03:57.120> thinner<00:03:57.450> but<00:03:57.630> stick<00:03:57.840> up<00:03:57.959> the<00:03:58.079> top

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
blade gets thinner but stick up the top

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.449 
blade gets thinner but stick up the top
here<00:03:58.470> and<00:03:58.560> it<00:03:58.650> gets<00:03:58.799> thinner<00:03:58.980> towards<00:03:59.340> the

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
here and it gets thinner towards the

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.440 
here and it gets thinner towards the
bottom<00:03:59.640> and<00:04:00.060> when<00:04:00.720> you're<00:04:00.900> making<00:04:01.320> the<00:04:01.709> sheet

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
bottom and when you're making the sheet

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.580 
bottom and when you're making the sheet
this<00:04:03.450> is<00:04:03.570> what<00:04:03.750> I'm<00:04:03.840> gonna<00:04:03.989> do<00:04:04.170> I'm<00:04:04.290> gonna<00:04:04.380> use

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
this is what I'm gonna do I'm gonna use

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.530 
this is what I'm gonna do I'm gonna use
this<00:04:04.739> chiseling<00:04:05.220> tool<00:04:05.459> to<00:04:05.730> chisel<00:04:06.060> out<00:04:06.290> this

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
this chiseling tool to chisel out this

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.530 
this chiseling tool to chisel out this
this<00:04:09.540> furrow<00:04:09.959> here<00:04:10.820> so<00:04:11.820> the<00:04:11.940> seat<00:04:12.150> can<00:04:12.360> fit

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
this furrow here so the seat can fit

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.370 
this furrow here so the seat can fit
inside<00:04:13.730> like<00:04:14.730> this<00:04:15.000> when<00:04:15.840> I<00:04:15.870> put<00:04:16.079> these<00:04:16.200> I'll

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
inside like this when I put these I'll

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.960 
inside like this when I put these I'll
put<00:04:16.709> a<00:04:16.739> furrow<00:04:16.979> in<00:04:17.190> this<00:04:17.340> one<00:04:17.519> and<00:04:17.700> in<00:04:17.790> this<00:04:17.910> one

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
put a furrow in this one and in this one

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.099

and then when you put them together

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.479 
and then when you put them together
you've<00:04:19.500> got<00:04:19.530> a<00:04:19.680> hole<00:04:19.859> in<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.160> end<00:04:20.280> that<00:04:20.400> you
