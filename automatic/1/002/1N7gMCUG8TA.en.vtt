00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.420 
and then finish out that design once
I've<00:02:38.150> done<00:02:38.330> that<00:02:38.390> I<00:02:38.840> can<00:02:38.870> quick<00:02:39.440> fill<00:02:39.800> in<00:02:40.070> the

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
I've done that I can quick fill in the

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.410 
I've done that I can quick fill in the
rest<00:02:40.640> of<00:02:40.820> the<00:02:40.910> nail<00:02:41.120> and<00:02:42.790> you<00:02:43.790> can<00:02:43.970> either<00:02:44.120> come

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
rest of the nail and you can either come

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.360 
rest of the nail and you can either come
back<00:02:44.450> in<00:02:44.810> with<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.080> polish<00:02:45.440> brush<00:02:45.740> to<00:02:45.950> fill<00:02:46.190> in

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
back in with the polish brush to fill in

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.110 
back in with the polish brush to fill in
or<00:02:46.580> you<00:02:46.730> can<00:02:46.880> just<00:02:47.120> quick<00:02:47.420> use<00:02:47.660> your<00:02:47.690> art<00:02:48.020> brush

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
or you can just quick use your art brush

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.140 
or you can just quick use your art brush
and<00:02:50.740> once<00:02:51.740> you've<00:02:51.980> established<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:52.730> design

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
and once you've established the design

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.120 
and once you've established the design
it'd<00:02:53.420> be<00:02:53.600> really<00:02:53.840> easy<00:02:53.990> to<00:02:54.320> come<00:02:54.620> back<00:02:54.800> in<00:02:54.980> with

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
it'd be really easy to come back in with

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.920 
it'd be really easy to come back in with
the<00:02:55.280> polish<00:02:55.640> brush<00:02:55.940> to<00:02:56.180> give<00:02:56.330> it<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:56.570> second

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
the polish brush to give it the second

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:07.390 
the polish brush to give it the second
coat<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:05.840> flip<00:03:06.110> side<00:03:06.380> of<00:03:06.410> this<00:03:06.740> is<00:03:07.010> that<00:03:07.250> the

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
coat the flip side of this is that the

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.710 
coat the flip side of this is that the
design<00:03:07.790> continues<00:03:08.690> on<00:03:08.960> the<00:03:09.080> other<00:03:09.110> side<00:03:10.720> so

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
design continues on the other side so

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.200 
design continues on the other side so
this<00:03:11.930> is<00:03:11.990> where<00:03:12.260> it<00:03:12.320> gets<00:03:12.500> a<00:03:12.590> little<00:03:12.620> tricky

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
this is where it gets a little tricky

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.600 
this is where it gets a little tricky
I'm<00:03:14.210> going<00:03:14.480> to<00:03:14.540> draw<00:03:14.840> a<00:03:15.110> line<00:03:15.550> straight<00:03:16.550> down

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
I'm going to draw a line straight down

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:22.630 
I'm going to draw a line straight down
the<00:03:17.450> opposite<00:03:18.170> side<00:03:18.910> in<00:03:19.910> the<00:03:20.690> design<00:03:21.020> and<00:03:21.640> then

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
the opposite side in the design and then

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.670 
the opposite side in the design and then
come<00:03:22.940> up<00:03:22.970> and<00:03:23.240> create<00:03:23.450> my<00:03:23.810> half<00:03:24.020> of<00:03:24.230> heart<00:03:24.440> from

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
come up and create my half of heart from

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.670 
come up and create my half of heart from
that<00:03:28.540> then<00:03:29.540> I'm<00:03:29.690> going<00:03:29.870> to<00:03:29.900> come<00:03:30.170> down<00:03:30.350> and

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
that then I'm going to come down and

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.920 
that then I'm going to come down and
draw<00:03:30.920> a<00:03:30.950> full<00:03:31.430> heart<00:03:31.760> just<00:03:32.150> the<00:03:32.240> opposite<00:03:32.810> of

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
draw a full heart just the opposite of

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:41.350 
draw a full heart just the opposite of
what's<00:03:33.170> on<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.350> other<00:03:33.470> side<00:03:39.760> and<00:03:40.760> I<00:03:40.820> generally

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
what's on the other side and I generally

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.080 
what's on the other side and I generally
like<00:03:41.600> to<00:03:41.900> pull<00:03:42.260> the<00:03:42.800> tail<00:03:43.070> of<00:03:43.340> the<00:03:43.490> clover<00:03:43.880> out

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
like to pull the tail of the clover out

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.930 
like to pull the tail of the clover out
on<00:03:44.360> the<00:03:44.540> white<00:03:44.720> side<00:03:48.190> and<00:03:49.190> then<00:03:49.340> just<00:03:49.580> kind<00:03:49.850> of

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
on the white side and then just kind of

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.400 
on the white side and then just kind of
clear<00:03:50.390> up<00:03:50.420> that<00:03:50.780> half-and-half<00:03:51.260> line<00:03:53.410> and

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
clear up that half-and-half line and

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:55.900 
clear up that half-and-half line and
give<00:03:54.620> that<00:03:54.770> a<00:03:54.800> little<00:03:55.100> bit<00:03:55.220> to<00:03:55.340> draw<00:03:55.520> and<00:03:55.760> come

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
give that a little bit to draw and come

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.650 
give that a little bit to draw and come
in<00:03:56.060> with<00:03:56.210> the<00:03:56.330> second<00:03:56.720> coat

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.710

and then when you come in with that

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.520 
and then when you come in with that
second<00:04:10.380> coat<00:04:10.560> of<00:04:10.590> green<00:04:12.320> everything<00:04:13.320> looks

second coat of green everything looks

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.220 
second coat of green everything looks
really<00:04:13.740> fun<00:04:14.100> and<00:04:14.400> if<00:04:15.360> you<00:04:15.480> really<00:04:15.840> wanted<00:04:16.080> to

really fun and if you really wanted to
make<00:04:16.410> that<00:04:16.590> pop<00:04:16.890> out<00:04:17.100> you<00:04:17.970> could<00:04:18.150> actually

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:18.360 
make that pop out you could actually

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.390 
make that pop out you could actually
come<00:04:18.810> in<00:04:19.019> and<00:04:19.230> go<00:04:19.410> over<00:04:19.769> it<00:04:19.860> with<00:04:19.980> your<00:04:20.160> emerald

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
come in and go over it with your emerald

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.080 
come in and go over it with your emerald
shimmer<00:04:21.590> which<00:04:22.590> makes<00:04:22.860> everything<00:04:23.280> sparkly

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
shimmer which makes everything sparkly

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.640 
shimmer which makes everything sparkly
and<00:04:24.330> it<00:04:24.420> would<00:04:24.540> make<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:24.750> white<00:04:25.080> have<00:04:25.350> a<00:04:25.380> nice

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
and it would make the white have a nice

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.270 
and it would make the white have a nice
shimmery<00:04:26.130> green<00:04:26.430> look<00:04:26.670> to<00:04:26.880> it<00:04:27.000> as<00:04:27.120> well<00:04:28.280> now

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
shimmery green look to it as well now

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.430 
shimmery green look to it as well now
