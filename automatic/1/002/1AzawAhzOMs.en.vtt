00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
dash of salt or pepper but I usually add

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.000 
dash of salt or pepper but I usually add
that<00:02:16.580> right<00:02:16.790> at<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.060> end<00:02:17.240> on<00:02:17.540> top<00:02:18.010> usually

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
that right at the end on top usually

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.860 
that right at the end on top usually
doesn't<00:02:19.550> need<00:02:19.670> it<00:02:19.820> because<00:02:19.940> with<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.480> Old<00:02:20.630> Bay

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
doesn't need it because with the Old Bay

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.110 
doesn't need it because with the Old Bay
it<00:02:21.110> gets<00:02:21.350> it<00:02:21.530> just<00:02:22.490> the<00:02:22.640> right<00:02:22.790> amount<00:02:23.060> of

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
it gets it just the right amount of

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.870 
it gets it just the right amount of
seasoning<00:02:23.440> so<00:02:24.440> I<00:02:24.470> have<00:02:24.860> that<00:02:25.130> it's<00:02:25.370> all<00:02:25.550> mixed

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880
