States so I think it's okay that I use
the<00:02:02.579> n-word<00:02:02.729> yeah<00:02:03.570> but<00:02:04.439> like<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:05.100> don't<00:02:05.579> think

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
the n-word yeah but like I don't think

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.240 
the n-word yeah but like I don't think
Irish<00:02:06.270> people<00:02:06.509> experience<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.500> same<00:02:07.680> lasting

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
oppression that people of color still

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.970

it's<00:02:13.400> all<00:02:13.550> bullshit<00:02:14.030> and<00:02:14.330> that's<00:02:14.569> when<00:02:14.780> I

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
it's all bullshit and that's when I

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.330 
it's all bullshit and that's when I
realized<00:02:15.260> that<00:02:15.500> being<00:02:15.739> politically<00:02:16.310> correct

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
realized that being politically correct

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.120 
realized that being politically correct
was<00:02:17.060> an<00:02:17.420> uphill<00:02:17.810> battle<00:02:17.870> like<00:02:18.680> you<00:02:18.800> can<00:02:18.950> work

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
was an uphill battle like you can work

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.800 
was an uphill battle like you can work
to<00:02:19.310> minimize<00:02:19.489> the<00:02:20.030> amount<00:02:20.209> you<00:02:20.420> offend

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
to minimize the amount you offend

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.540 
to minimize the amount you offend
minorities<00:02:21.440> and<00:02:21.770> other<00:02:21.860> people<00:02:22.220> in<00:02:22.310> general

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
minorities and other people in general

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.960 
minorities and other people in general
and<00:02:23.150> other<00:02:23.930> people<00:02:24.410> will<00:02:24.650> still<00:02:24.980> take<00:02:25.400> offense

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
and other people will still take offense

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.820 
and other people will still take offense
to<00:02:26.239> the<00:02:26.360> fact<00:02:26.390> that<00:02:26.750> you<00:02:27.080> were<00:02:27.230> trying<00:02:27.500> not<00:02:27.769> to

be<00:02:28.130> offensive<00:02:28.459> it's<00:02:29.360> amazing<00:02:29.959> because<00:02:30.260> being

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
be offensive it's amazing because being

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.410 
be offensive it's amazing because being
offensive<00:02:30.950> isn't<00:02:31.610> telling<00:02:31.849> it<00:02:32.090> like<00:02:32.120> it<00:02:32.269> is
