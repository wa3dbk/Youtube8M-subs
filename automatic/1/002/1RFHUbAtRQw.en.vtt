00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
the 1260 has an inner ring that's more

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.990 
the 1260 has an inner ring that's more
restrictive<00:01:57.409> than<00:01:57.619> the<00:01:57.680> 1262<00:01:58.490> and<00:01:59.770> from<00:02:01.000> the

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
restrictive than the 1262 and from the

like<00:02:04.220> that<00:02:04.490> it<00:02:05.090> basically<00:02:05.509> turns<00:02:06.050> it<00:02:06.320> into

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
like that it basically turns it into

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.120 
like that it basically turns it into
1260<00:02:07.340> to<00:02:08.560> about<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:09.709> same<00:02:09.890> wattage

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
1260 to about the same wattage

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.310 
1260 to about the same wattage
everything<00:02:10.759> really<00:02:11.150> that's<00:02:11.660> really<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:12.140> only

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
everything really that's really the only

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.780 
everything really that's really the only
physical<00:02:12.530> difference<00:02:13.160> between<00:02:13.489> the<00:02:13.610> two

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
physical difference between the two

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.759 
physical difference between the two
pumps<00:02:14.269> you<00:02:15.110> got<00:02:15.290> a<00:02:15.320> the<00:02:15.860> depart<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:17.750> 1262<00:02:18.380> part

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
pumps you got a the depart the 1262 part

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:21.280 
pumps you got a the depart the 1262 part
you<00:02:18.890> get<00:02:19.070> does<00:02:19.340> not<00:02:19.550> come<00:02:19.760> with<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.120> o-ring<00:02:20.450> so

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
you get does not come with the o-ring so

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.009 
you get does not come with the o-ring so
you<00:02:21.350> gotta<00:02:21.590> take<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.190> o-ring<00:02:22.760> out<00:02:23.000> of<00:02:23.600> the<00:02:23.840> one

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
you gotta take the o-ring out of the one

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:29.580 
you gotta take the o-ring out of the one
that<00:02:24.200> comes<00:02:24.410> with<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.620> 1260<00:02:25.330> put<00:02:26.330> it<00:02:26.450> on<00:02:26.570> there

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.960 

it<00:02:30.590> does<00:02:30.739> happen<00:02:31.040> a<00:02:31.069> little<00:02:31.160> in<00:02:31.400> a<00:02:31.489> rubber<00:02:31.790> ring

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
it does happen a little in a rubber ring

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.000 
it does happen a little in a rubber ring
it<00:02:32.720> does<00:02:32.870> come<00:02:33.080> with<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.290> inner<00:02:33.440> rubber<00:02:33.800> ring

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
it does come with the inner rubber ring

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:42.370 
it does come with the inner rubber ring
so<00:02:34.190> you<00:02:34.250> have<00:02:34.370> to<00:02:34.489> worry<00:02:34.730> about<00:02:34.790> that<00:02:41.230> lined<00:02:42.230> up

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
so you have to worry about that lined up

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.710 
so you have to worry about that lined up
push<00:02:43.010> it<00:02:43.040> in<00:02:43.340> there

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.330 

and<00:02:49.170> that's<00:02:49.380> basically<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.490> now<00:02:50.820> this<00:02:51.060> pump<00:02:51.360> is

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
and that's basically it now this pump is

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.150 
and that's basically it now this pump is
supposed<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.400> be<00:02:53.550> 1262<00:02:54.540> now<00:02:54.840> and<00:02:55.440> you<00:02:55.860> probably

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
supposed to be 1262 now and you probably

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.270 
supposed to be 1262 now and you probably
saved<00:02:56.340> like<00:02:56.520> about<00:02:56.730> 50<00:02:57.150> bucks<00:02:57.650> by<00:02:58.650> just<00:02:58.950> doing

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
saved like about 50 bucks by just doing

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.800 
saved like about 50 bucks by just doing
this<00:02:59.370> mod<00:02:59.640> versus<00:03:00.210> buying<00:03:00.450> a<00:03:00.840> 1262<00:03:01.590> by<00:03:01.980> itself

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
this mod versus buying a 1262 by itself

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.420 
this mod versus buying a 1262 by itself
all<00:03:03.810> right<00:03:04.020> I'll<00:03:04.260> probably<00:03:04.470> cut<00:03:04.740> out<00:03:04.890> probably

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
all right I'll probably cut out probably

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.800 
all right I'll probably cut out probably
see<00:03:05.610> if<00:03:05.730> I<00:03:05.820> we<00:03:06.000> could<00:03:06.210> probably<00:03:06.360> put<00:03:06.690> together

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
see if I we could probably put together

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.910 
see if I we could probably put together
a<00:03:07.080> video<00:03:07.560> of<00:03:08.210> the<00:03:09.210> pump<00:03:09.480> organ<00:03:09.960> getting<00:03:10.770> some

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
a video of the pump organ getting some

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.000 
a video of the pump organ getting some
gallons<00:03:11.340> out<00:03:11.520> and<00:03:12.300> see<00:03:12.510> putting<00:03:13.020> comparison

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
gallons out and see putting comparison

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.250 
gallons out and see putting comparison
between<00:03:14.250> with<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.880> same<00:03:15.090> pump<00:03:15.330> but<00:03:15.960> between

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
between with the same pump but between

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.310 
between with the same pump but between
the<00:03:16.470> two<00:03:16.620> heads<00:03:19.400> alright<00:03:20.400> guys<00:03:20.640> so<00:03:21.090> we're<00:03:21.270> back

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
the two heads alright guys so we're back

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.550 
the two heads alright guys so we're back
I<00:03:22.320> got<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.310> bucket<00:03:23.640> set<00:03:23.850> up<00:03:24.030> outside<00:03:24.560> got

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
I got the bucket set up outside got

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.960 
I got the bucket set up outside got
three<00:03:25.860> and<00:03:25.920> a<00:03:25.980> half<00:03:26.070> gallons<00:03:26.460> of<00:03:26.520> water<00:03:26.730> in

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
three and a half gallons of water in

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.940 
three and a half gallons of water in
there<00:03:28.790> it's<00:03:29.790> probably<00:03:30.030> going<00:03:30.360> to<00:03:30.420> start

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
there it's probably going to start

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.940 
there it's probably going to start
pulling<00:03:31.950> air<00:03:32.340> around<00:03:32.700> one<00:03:33.420> app<00:03:33.600> gallons<00:03:34.080> to

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
pulling air around one app gallons to

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.250 
pulling air around one app gallons to
one<00:03:35.160> in<00:03:35.250> a<00:03:35.340> quarry<00:03:35.730> gallons<00:03:36.270> the<00:03:36.870> pump<00:03:37.140> will

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
one in a quarry gallons the pump will

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.600 
one in a quarry gallons the pump will
probably<00:03:37.530> stop<00:03:37.710> pulling<00:03:38.040> air<00:03:38.190> I<00:03:38.220> got<00:03:38.400> it

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
probably stop pulling air I got it

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.070 
probably stop pulling air I got it
connected<00:03:38.910> to<00:03:39.180> one<00:03:39.330> of<00:03:39.390> those<00:03:39.510> like<00:03:39.690> Christmas

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
connected to one of those like Christmas

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.910 
connected to one of those like Christmas
tree<00:03:40.820> remote<00:03:41.820> timers<00:03:42.300> and<00:03:42.480> I<00:03:42.540> have<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:42.960> switch

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
tree remote timers and I have the switch

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.960 
tree remote timers and I have the switch
right<00:03:44.100> here<00:03:44.400> so<00:03:45.740> let's<00:03:46.740> see<00:03:46.980> right<00:03:47.220> now<00:03:47.520> it<00:03:47.790> has

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
right here so let's see right now it has

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.560 
right here so let's see right now it has
the<00:03:49.100> Dafydd<00:03:50.100> that<00:03:50.340> came<00:03:50.550> with<00:03:50.790> it<00:03:50.820> the<00:03:51.090> 1260

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
the Dafydd that came with it the 1260

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.390 
the Dafydd that came with it the 1260
fit<00:03:51.990> and<00:03:52.170> that<00:03:52.290> came<00:03:52.470> with<00:03:52.680> it<00:03:52.709> so<00:03:53.010> let's<00:03:53.280> see

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
fit and that came with it so let's see

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.910 
fit and that came with it so let's see
how<00:03:53.610> fast<00:03:54.030> they'll<00:03:54.870> take<00:03:55.260> well<00:03:55.560> how<00:03:55.680> long

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
how fast they'll take well how long

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.240 
how fast they'll take well how long
sorry<00:03:56.280> it'll<00:03:56.760> take<00:03:56.940> to<00:03:57.590> get<00:03:58.590> down<00:03:58.739> to<00:03:58.980> one<00:03:59.130> and

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
sorry it'll take to get down to one and

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:17.300 
sorry it'll take to get down to one and
a<00:03:59.310> half<00:03:59.340> gallons

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.460 

all<00:04:18.310> right<00:04:18.520> so<00:04:18.790> let's<00:04:19.540> go<00:04:19.780> ahead<00:04:19.870> refill<00:04:20.380> the

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
all right so let's go ahead refill the

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.010 
all right so let's go ahead refill the
bucket<00:04:20.830> switch<00:04:21.190> the<00:04:21.340> parts<00:04:21.580> at<00:04:21.790> a<00:04:21.850> 1262<00:04:22.600> part

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
bucket switch the parts at a 1262 part

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.430 
bucket switch the parts at a 1262 part
and<00:04:23.290> see<00:04:23.710> what<00:04:23.860> we<00:04:23.950> got

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
and see what we got

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.310 
and see what we got
okay<00:04:26.440> so<00:04:26.500> we're<00:04:26.800> back<00:04:27.040> I<00:04:27.430> got<00:04:28.060> the<00:04:28.240> 1262<00:04:28.870> part

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
okay so we're back I got the 1262 part

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.250 
okay so we're back I got the 1262 part
in<00:04:29.440> there<00:04:29.650> now<00:04:30.190> I<00:04:30.220> notice<00:04:30.810> one<00:04:31.810> thing<00:04:31.990> to<00:04:32.110> note

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
in there now I notice one thing to note

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.630 
in there now I notice one thing to note
is<00:04:32.470> that<00:04:32.500> I<00:04:32.710> have<00:04:33.040> the<00:04:33.630> hose<00:04:35.100> way<00:04:36.100> hide<00:04:36.370> in<00:04:36.550> the

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
is that I have the hose way hide in the

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.410 
is that I have the hose way hide in the
bucket<00:04:37.030> so<00:04:37.680> siphon<00:04:38.680> issue<00:04:38.890> should<00:04:39.370> be

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
bucket so siphon issue should be

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.300 
bucket so siphon issue should be
eliminated<00:04:40.420> by<00:04:40.600> having<00:04:40.960> it<00:04:41.050> higher<00:04:41.230> than<00:04:41.590> the

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
eliminated by having it higher than the

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.880 
eliminated by having it higher than the
pump<00:04:42.520> all<00:04:43.390> right<00:04:43.630> so<00:04:43.870> let's<00:04:44.560> go<00:04:44.680> ahead<00:04:44.740> and

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
pump all right so let's go ahead and

00:04:44.890 --> 00:05:00.980 
pump all right so let's go ahead and
start

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.620 

all<00:05:01.990> right<00:05:02.170> so<00:05:02.350> that's<00:05:02.500> drain<00:05:03.220> down<00:05:03.430> to<00:05:03.670> 1/2

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
all right so that's drain down to 1/2

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.780 
all right so that's drain down to 1/2
gallons<00:05:05.050> I<00:05:05.290> know<00:05:06.100> you<00:05:06.190> probably<00:05:06.340> can't<00:05:06.520> really

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
gallons I know you probably can't really

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.540 
gallons I know you probably can't really
tell<00:05:07.090> right<00:05:07.390> now<00:05:07.590> naked<00:05:08.590> I<00:05:08.860> can't<00:05:09.190> really<00:05:09.310> tell

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
tell right now naked I can't really tell

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:10.740 
tell right now naked I can't really tell
which<00:05:09.700> ones<00:05:09.910> past<00:05:10.120> I<00:05:10.270> can't<00:05:10.510> really<00:05:10.600> remember

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
which ones past I can't really remember

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.110 
which ones past I can't really remember
but<00:05:11.530> in<00:05:11.710> the<00:05:11.770> Edit<00:05:12.040> and<00:05:12.220> I<00:05:12.340> will<00:05:12.520> put<00:05:12.760> up<00:05:12.790> a

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
but in the Edit and I will put up a

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.870 
but in the Edit and I will put up a
timer<00:05:13.630> so<00:05:14.410> I<00:05:14.800> guess<00:05:15.100> we<00:05:15.250> could<00:05:15.370> see<00:05:15.520> which<00:05:15.670> one

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
timer so I guess we could see which one

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.460 
timer so I guess we could see which one
was<00:05:16.060> a<00:05:16.090> little<00:05:16.360> faster<00:05:16.720> displaced<00:05:17.200> in<00:05:17.320> that

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
was a little faster displaced in that

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:28.750 
was a little faster displaced in that
amount<00:05:17.740> of<00:05:18.750> gallons

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:28.760 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.820
