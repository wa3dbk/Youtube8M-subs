00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
hovering up chin up and this movement

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.179 
hovering up chin up and this movement
should<00:01:06.960> not<00:01:07.140> affect<00:01:07.500> your<00:01:07.710> upper<00:01:07.979> body

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
should not affect your upper body

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:28.279 
should not affect your upper body
whatsoever<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.780> let's<00:01:09.930> try<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.080> with<00:01:10.320> music

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:28.289 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:37.980 

stepping<00:01:29.289> right<00:01:29.319> stepping<00:01:30.569> left<00:01:36.840> let's<00:01:37.840> try

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
stepping right stepping left let's try

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:48.059 
stepping right stepping left let's try
it<00:01:38.049> a<00:01:38.200> little<00:01:38.469> bit<00:01:38.560> faster<00:01:39.069> so<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:47.829> want<00:01:47.979> to

00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:48.069 
it a little bit faster so you want to

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:49.770 
it a little bit faster so you want to
make<00:01:48.189> sure<00:01:48.220> that<00:01:48.640> your<00:01:48.789> tailbone<00:01:49.060> is<00:01:49.390> pointing

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
make sure that your tailbone is pointing

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.809 
make sure that your tailbone is pointing
down<00:01:49.959> no<00:01:50.170> matter<00:01:50.380> what<00:01:50.649> and<00:01:50.890> your<00:01:51.340> lower<00:01:51.549> abs

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:51.819 
down no matter what and your lower abs

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:53.760 
down no matter what and your lower abs
are<00:01:52.119> still<00:01:52.450> engaged<00:01:52.659> and<00:01:53.110> there<00:01:53.500> is<00:01:53.619> no

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
are still engaged and there is no

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.949 
are still engaged and there is no
twisting<00:01:54.310> to<00:01:54.549> this<00:01:54.700> motion<00:01:54.969> so<00:01:55.599> it's<00:01:55.719> actually

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:55.959 
twisting to this motion so it's actually

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:58.199 
twisting to this motion so it's actually
happening<00:01:56.679> just<00:01:56.920> from<00:01:57.099> side<00:01:57.310> to<00:01:57.340> side<00:01:57.489> there

00:01:58.199 --> 00:01:58.209 
happening just from side to side there

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:59.999 
happening just from side to side there
is<00:01:58.390> no<00:01:58.569> front<00:01:58.750> to<00:01:58.929> back<00:01:59.079> dimension<00:01:59.530> to<00:01:59.679> it<00:01:59.829> and

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
is no front to back dimension to it and

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:08.600 
is no front to back dimension to it and
the<00:02:00.369> tailbone<00:02:00.579> is<00:02:00.879> tucked<00:02:00.909> down<00:02:01.560> once<00:02:02.560> again

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.069 

for<00:02:09.610> now<00:02:09.759> I<00:02:09.789> would<00:02:10.030> recommend<00:02:10.239> keeping<00:02:10.959> this

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:11.079 
for now I would recommend keeping this

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:12.809 
for now I would recommend keeping this
completely<00:02:11.620> out<00:02:11.829> of<00:02:11.980> your<00:02:12.099> chest<00:02:12.340> and<00:02:12.519> hyper

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
completely out of your chest and hyper

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.240 
completely out of your chest and hyper
isolated<00:02:13.660> but<00:02:14.260> sometimes<00:02:14.650> you<00:02:14.829> might<00:02:14.950> want<00:02:15.010> to

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
isolated but sometimes you might want to

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.580 
isolated but sometimes you might want to
let<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:15.760> chest<00:02:16.030> get<00:02:16.540> involved<00:02:17.049> and<00:02:17.170> let<00:02:17.440> it

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
let the chest get involved and let it

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.729 
let the chest get involved and let it
travel<00:02:17.890> into<00:02:18.430> your<00:02:18.549> upper<00:02:18.760> body<00:02:22.560> so<00:02:23.560> that's

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
travel into your upper body so that's

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.480 
travel into your upper body so that's
how<00:02:23.859> you<00:02:23.920> do<00:02:24.130> and<00:02:24.400> up<00:02:24.609> to<00:02:24.790> down<00:02:24.970> figure<00:02:25.329> eight
