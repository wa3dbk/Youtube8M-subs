 Quite tension is also this I'd such Toka clan that can not be used even so much with the other Darudaru 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.380
 Because the tension of regular tuning will be reduced

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:21.430
 The flex time is that for pickups and for that modeling 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:28.180
 Nara because you know that portion 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:32.180
 This month is made by Graphtec, but plastic ap is like this 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:37.100
 There is a tremolo unit in it 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:39.160
 What 8 was made only to the guitar in the fact that this Tees pickup is on 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:43.000
 is not it 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:48.190
 Although the I snare 28 different model comes out in a month time 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:52.990
 Where's 89 types just another example plus it 's in the custom punk city 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:56.920
