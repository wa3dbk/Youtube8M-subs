00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
really like the idea that because it

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.450 
really like the idea that because it
keeps<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.689> keeps<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.470> bigger<00:01:19.920> companies<00:01:20.280> more

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
honest you know what I mean they

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.289 
honest you know what I mean they
actually<00:01:22.380> have<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.590> step<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:22.920> up<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.100> notch<00:01:23.299> you

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
actually have to step it up a notch you

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.370 
actually have to step it up a notch you
know<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.509> bigger<00:01:24.720> companies<00:01:25.080> do<00:01:25.229> the

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
know the bigger companies do the

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.289 
know the bigger companies do the
research<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.830> development<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.460> then<00:01:26.909> the

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
research and development and then the

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.520 
research and development and then the
smaller<00:01:27.540> companies<00:01:27.900> can<00:01:28.049> actually<00:01:28.290> come<00:01:28.439> in

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
smaller companies can actually come in

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.620 
smaller companies can actually come in
and<00:01:28.680> buy<00:01:28.799> products<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:30.000> know<00:01:30.090> maybe<00:01:30.299> about<00:01:30.570> a

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
and buy products you know maybe about a

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.600 
and buy products you know maybe about a
year<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.140> later<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.070> everybody<00:01:32.400> reaps

to<00:03:07.829> stick<00:03:08.069> so<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:09.060> input<00:03:09.180> that<00:03:09.450> i'm<00:03:09.540> giving

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
to stick so the input that i'm giving

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.020 
to stick so the input that i'm giving
you<00:03:09.810> guys<00:03:10.019> here<00:03:10.379> is<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.859> input<00:03:10.980> that<00:03:11.340> that

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
kind of shows them on the product that i

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.860 
kind of shows them on the product that i
used<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.250> what<00:03:14.340> i<00:03:14.400> felt<00:03:14.699> personally<00:03:15.599> on<00:03:15.720> this

durability as far as flexibility and
that<00:03:43.109> that<00:03:43.440> basically<00:03:43.620> means<00:03:43.980> two<00:03:44.639> different

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
flexibility I'm going to give it a five

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.699

nice solid feel to it and that's one
thing<00:04:14.669> I<00:04:14.790> really<00:04:14.940> did<00:04:15.209> like<00:04:15.359> about<00:04:15.389> the<00:04:15.750> stick

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
thing I really did like about the stick

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.240 
thing I really did like about the stick
some<00:04:16.079> wouldn't<00:04:16.260> give<00:04:16.349> that<00:04:16.380> afore<00:04:16.829> stick

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
some wouldn't give that afore stick

some wouldn't give that afore stick
handling<00:04:17.549> of<00:04:17.669> course<00:04:17.880> with<00:04:18.090> the<00:04:18.180> curve<00:04:18.359> that

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
handling of course with the curve that

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.740 
handling of course with the curve that
that<00:04:18.959> I<00:04:18.989> use<00:04:19.229> which<00:04:19.440> was<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:19.709> Madonna<00:04:20.010> curve

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
I'm going to give that a five visual

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.960 
I'm going to give that a five visual
looks<00:04:24.440> it's<00:04:24.800> not<00:04:24.950> nothing<00:04:25.100> real<00:04:25.460> fancy<00:04:25.490> guys

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970
