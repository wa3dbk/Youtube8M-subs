you<00:01:42.310> guys<00:01:42.640> are<00:01:42.940> but<00:01:43.570> actually<00:01:43.840> real<00:01:44.260> value

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
you guys are but actually real value

authority and there is that so on the
other<00:01:53.080> we<00:01:53.500> bet<00:01:53.710> is<00:01:53.830> not<00:01:54.010> a<00:01:54.040> sufficient<00:01:54.490> answer

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
other we bet is not a sufficient answer

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.560

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
battlegrounds like we're so poor like

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.480 
battlegrounds like we're so poor like
any<00:05:22.170> no<00:05:22.290> horse<00:05:22.470> don't<00:05:22.650> like<00:05:22.800> a<00:05:24.560> long<00:05:25.560> time<00:05:25.860> so

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
any no horse don't like a long time so

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.880 
any no horse don't like a long time so
so<00:05:27.090> it<00:05:27.510> gets<00:05:27.630> me<00:05:27.840> finding<00:05:28.320> the<00:05:28.410> players<00:05:28.620> aren't

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.230 
so it gets me finding the players aren't
able<00:05:28.980> to<00:05:29.130> track<00:05:29.310> things<00:05:29.490> will<00:05:30.030> make<00:05:30.120> it

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
able to track things will make it

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.430
