a lot<00:00:00.240> of<00:00:00.269> you<00:00:00.450> are<00:00:00.570> wondering<00:00:00.719> what<00:00:01.199> is

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:01.560 
a lot of you are wondering what is

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.490 
a lot of you are wondering what is
vibrational<00:00:02.490> HCG<00:00:03.030> and<00:00:03.360> how<00:00:03.780> is<00:00:04.080> that<00:00:04.110> any

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
vibrational HCG and how is that any

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.220 
vibrational HCG and how is that any
different<00:00:04.589> from<00:00:04.980> the<00:00:05.160> homeopathic<00:00:05.609> HCG<00:00:06.230> that

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
different from the homeopathic HCG that

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.589 
different from the homeopathic HCG that
we've<00:00:07.350> had<00:00:07.529> before<00:00:07.890> first<00:00:08.849> off<00:00:09.059> I<00:00:09.210> want<00:00:09.420> to<00:00:09.480> say

we've had before first off I want to say

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.410 
we've had before first off I want to say
I<00:00:10.530> have<00:00:10.950> absolutely<00:00:11.580> nothing<00:00:11.940> negative<00:00:12.210> to

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
I have absolutely nothing negative to

I<00:00:18.300> feel<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.510> superior<00:00:19.160> has<00:00:20.160> nothing<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.730> do<00:00:20.880> with

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
I feel a superior has nothing to do with

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.080 
I feel a superior has nothing to do with
how<00:00:21.180> i<00:00:21.210> feel<00:00:21.449> about<00:00:21.510> homeopathy<00:00:22.880> this<00:00:23.880> is

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
how i feel about homeopathy this is

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.689 
how i feel about homeopathy this is
actually<00:00:24.660> just<00:00:25.140> kind<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.220> next

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
actually just kind of a the next

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.450 
actually just kind of a the next
evolutionary<00:00:27.390> step<00:00:27.539> in<00:00:28.199> in<00:00:28.619> technology<00:00:29.310> when

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
evolutionary step in in technology when

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.759 
evolutionary step in in technology when
it<00:00:29.490> comes<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:30.000> energy<00:00:30.150> medicine<00:00:30.779> homeopathy

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
it comes to energy medicine homeopathy

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.950 
it comes to energy medicine homeopathy
has<00:00:32.099> been<00:00:32.250> around<00:00:32.430> since<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.820> 1700s<00:00:33.480> there

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
has been around since the 1700s there

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.139 
has been around since the 1700s there
hasn't<00:00:34.290> really<00:00:34.500> been<00:00:35.309> anything<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.790> compare

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
hasn't really been anything to compare

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.010 
hasn't really been anything to compare
to<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.630> until<00:00:37.500> now<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.219> so<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:39.360> vibrational

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
to it until now and so this vibrational

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.709 
to it until now and so this vibrational
HCG<00:00:40.649> it's<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.250> same<00:00:41.460> concept<00:00:42.120> as<00:00:42.239> far<00:00:42.480> as<00:00:42.600> the

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
HCG it's the same concept as far as the

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.049 
HCG it's the same concept as far as the
energetic<00:00:43.110> imprint<00:00:43.890> that's<00:00:44.460> put<00:00:44.700> into<00:00:44.850> the

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
energetic imprint that's put into the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.010 
energetic imprint that's put into the
molecules<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.809> glycerin<00:00:46.500> water<00:00:46.710> base<00:00:48.020> but

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
molecules of the glycerin water base but

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.430 
molecules of the glycerin water base but
it's<00:00:49.379> put<00:00:50.100> in<00:00:50.280> there<00:00:50.660> it's<00:00:51.660> just<00:00:51.960> put<00:00:52.140> in<00:00:52.260> there

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
it's put in there it's just put in there

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.170 
it's put in there it's just put in there
straight<00:00:52.860> it's<00:00:53.129> not<00:00:53.340> diluted<00:00:53.850> like<00:00:54.030> with

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
straight it's not diluted like with

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.680 
straight it's not diluted like with
homeopathy<00:00:55.129> and<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:56.640> it's<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.480> know<00:00:57.570> we

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
homeopathy and so it's you know we

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.349 
homeopathy and so it's you know we
believe<00:00:57.989> it's<00:00:58.140> more<00:00:58.320> potent<00:00:59.090> it's<00:01:00.090> more

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
believe it's more potent it's more

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.950 
believe it's more potent it's more
stable<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.699> and<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.329> know<00:01:03.359> our<00:01:03.629> bodies

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
stable and and so you know our bodies

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.750 
stable and and so you know our bodies
are<00:01:04.110> made<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.350> energy<00:01:04.500> not<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.070> chemicals<00:01:05.549> and

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
are made of energy not of chemicals and

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.899 
are made of energy not of chemicals and
so<00:01:05.909> when<00:01:06.150> you're<00:01:06.270> using<00:01:06.510> something<00:01:07.909> that's

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
so when you're using something that's

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.270 
so when you're using something that's
got<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.600> energy<00:01:09.930> energetic<00:01:10.590> imprint<00:01:11.070> in

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
got the the energy energetic imprint in

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.320 
got the the energy energetic imprint in
it<00:01:11.460> it's<00:01:11.670> much<00:01:11.909> more<00:01:12.180> natural<00:01:12.689> it's<00:01:12.930> much<00:01:13.200> more

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
it it's much more natural it's much more

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.679 
it it's much more natural it's much more
potent<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.450> think<00:01:15.780> it's<00:01:16.020> it's<00:01:16.350> more<00:01:16.830> effective

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
potent I think it's it's more effective

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:20.240 
potent I think it's it's more effective
of<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.810> product<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.259> use<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.799> if<00:01:19.890> you're<00:01:20.040> using

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
of a product to use and if you're using

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.950 
of a product to use and if you're using
some<00:01:20.580> chemical<00:01:21.000> that's<00:01:21.180> forcing<00:01:21.570> your<00:01:21.750> body

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
some chemical that's forcing your body

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.359 
some chemical that's forcing your body
to<00:01:22.170> do<00:01:22.290> something<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.799> maybe<00:01:22.979> your<00:01:23.189> body

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
to do something that maybe your body

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.460 
to do something that maybe your body
doesn't<00:01:23.610> need<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.090> do<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:24.720> when<00:01:25.320> you're

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
doesn't need to do so when you're

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.190 
doesn't need to do so when you're
working<00:01:25.650> with<00:01:25.950> energy<00:01:26.369> medicine<00:01:26.810> it's<00:01:27.810> that's

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
working with energy medicine it's that's

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.260 
working with energy medicine it's that's
totally<00:01:28.950> different<00:01:29.130> it's<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.939> totally

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
totally different it's a totally

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.499 
totally different it's a totally
different<00:01:30.299> reaction<00:01:31.079> with<00:01:31.770> your<00:01:31.979> body<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:33.150> so

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
different reaction with your body and so

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.390 
different reaction with your body and so
you<00:01:34.200> know<00:01:34.290> we<00:01:34.470> just<00:01:34.650> feel<00:01:34.799> like<00:01:34.890> it's<00:01:35.100> it's

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
you know we just feel like it's it's

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.480 
you know we just feel like it's it's
superior<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:36.500> to<00:01:37.500> anything<00:01:37.710> else<00:01:38.009> out<00:01:38.189> there

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
superior to to anything else out there

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.410 
superior to to anything else out there
so<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.409> what<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.799> is<00:01:41.000> it's<00:01:42.000> a

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
so that is that is what it is it's a

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.280 
so that is that is what it is it's a
step<00:01:42.659> above<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.170> homeopathic<00:01:44.270> and<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:46.140> it's

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
step above the homeopathic and and it's

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.359 
step above the homeopathic and and it's
a<00:01:46.740> superior<00:01:47.520> as<00:01:47.759> far<00:01:48.060> as<00:01:48.240> how<00:01:48.420> well<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.720> works

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
a superior as far as how well it works

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.450 
a superior as far as how well it works
and<00:01:50.369> so<00:01:51.380> so<00:01:52.380> that's<00:01:52.619> about<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:52.920> i<00:01:53.070> hope<00:01:53.280> i

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
and so so that's about it i hope i

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.010 
and so so that's about it i hope i
explained<00:01:53.790> that<00:01:53.820> well<00:01:54.090> for<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.509> to

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
explained that well for you to

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.620 
explained that well for you to
understand<00:01:55.920> if<00:01:56.189> not<00:01:56.479> there's<00:01:57.479> more

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
understand if not there's more
