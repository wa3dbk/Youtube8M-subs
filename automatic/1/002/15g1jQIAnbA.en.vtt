00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
will see on the video is that it has the

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.730 
will see on the video is that it has the
4k<00:01:34.189> upscale<00:01:35.210> resolution<00:01:36.210> quality<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:37.079> guess

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
4k upscale resolution quality I guess

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.620 
4k upscale resolution quality I guess
that's<00:01:37.920> something<00:01:38.100> new<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:38.820> did<00:01:39.150> not<00:01:39.180> know

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
that's something new that I did not know

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.620 
that's something new that I did not know
about<00:01:39.840> on<00:01:40.170> YouTube<00:01:40.650> until<00:01:41.189> today<00:01:41.670> like<00:01:42.240> just<00:01:42.479> a

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
about on YouTube until today like just a

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.600 
about on YouTube until today like just a
couple<00:01:42.659> minutes<00:01:43.020> ago<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:44.100> kind<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.369> wanted

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
couple minutes ago and I kind of wanted

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.940 
couple minutes ago and I kind of wanted
to<00:01:44.700> give<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.970> tracks<00:01:45.240> i<00:01:45.479> really<00:01:45.840> doubt<00:01:46.110> there

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
to give it a tracks i really doubt there

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.100 
to give it a tracks i really doubt there
are<00:01:46.979> many<00:01:47.130> people<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:47.850> have<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.450> ability<00:01:48.479> to

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
are many people that have the ability to

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.190 
are many people that have the ability to
do<00:01:49.350> team<00:01:50.280> fortress<00:01:50.610> 2<00:01:50.909> in<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.210> 4k<00:01:51.630> resolution

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
do team fortress 2 in a 4k resolution

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.060 
do team fortress 2 in a 4k resolution
which<00:01:52.409> i<00:01:52.680> guess<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:53.340> something<00:01:53.850> like<00:01:54.409> two<00:01:55.409> or

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
which i guess is something like two or

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.840 
which i guess is something like two or
two<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.460> half<00:01:56.549> times<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.180> size<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:58.020> 1080p

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
two and a half times the size of 1080p

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.420 
two and a half times the size of 1080p
so<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.299> apparently<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.110> if<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.680> upscale

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
so and apparently that if you upscale

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.780 
so and apparently that if you upscale
into<00:02:02.969> 4k<00:02:03.630> resolution<00:02:04.200> because<00:02:04.350> i<00:02:04.500> doubt

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
into 4k resolution because i doubt

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.150 
into 4k resolution because i doubt
anyone<00:02:05.790> actually<00:02:06.270> has<00:02:06.630> 4k<00:02:07.049> monitors<00:02:07.710> maybe

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
anyone actually has 4k monitors maybe

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.760 
anyone actually has 4k monitors maybe

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.490 
pushed me out and I couldn't get back
anyways<00:02:19.800> apparently<00:02:20.730> it<00:02:20.940> makes<00:02:20.970> your<00:02:21.510> 720p

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
anyways apparently it makes your 720p

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.060 
anyways apparently it makes your 720p
and<00:02:22.710> your<00:02:22.920> 1080p<00:02:23.810> gameplay<00:02:24.810> look<00:02:25.170> even<00:02:25.710> better

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
and your 1080p gameplay look even better

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.280 
and your 1080p gameplay look even better
so<00:02:26.850> it's<00:02:26.970> kind<00:02:27.150> of<00:02:27.180> just<00:02:27.270> a<00:02:27.420> test<00:02:27.660> maybe<00:02:28.110> it's

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
so it's kind of just a test maybe it's

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.630 
so it's kind of just a test maybe it's
the<00:02:28.470> fourth<00:02:28.770> first<00:02:29.250> like<00:02:30.170> legit<00:02:31.170> 4k<00:02:31.890> team

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
makes sense right here I saw the uber

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:20.990 
makes sense right here I saw the uber
waiting<00:03:19.530> to<00:03:19.980> get<00:03:20.070> on<00:03:20.130> the<00:03:20.220> point<00:03:20.519> I<00:03:20.700> assume

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
waiting to get on the point I assume

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000 
waiting to get on the point I assume
there<00:03:21.180> was<00:03:21.269> no<00:03:21.450> sentry<00:03:21.930> gun<00:03:22.170> at<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.620> bottom

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
there was no sentry gun at the bottom

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.770 
there was no sentry gun at the bottom
but<00:03:23.610> there<00:03:23.790> ended<00:03:24.000> up<00:03:24.060> being<00:03:24.120> a<00:03:24.330> centring<00:03:24.660> up

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
but there ended up being a centring up

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.320 
but there ended up being a centring up
top<00:03:25.019> it<00:03:25.230> kind<00:03:25.799> of<00:03:25.830> was<00:03:26.010> my<00:03:26.280> life<00:03:26.489> like<00:03:27.180> this

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
round I really thought was going quite

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.830 
round I really thought was going quite
poorly<00:03:29.489> like<00:03:29.850> I<00:03:29.970> really<00:03:30.239> wasn't<00:03:30.420> doing
