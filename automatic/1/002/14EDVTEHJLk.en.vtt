00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:17.250

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.260
 you a much anticipated boxing motogp 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.760
 third generation 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.550
 I got this handset faster 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.619
 possible and that the black version with 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.619
 16 days of internal memory 1 gb of 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.990
 ram memory and accompanies the black motoshow 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.420
 So it's good, then it's okay, people. 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.480
 let's go to the third motor booty 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.309
 this generation is one of the successors one grandson 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.489
 of the great successes of the motorola that 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.840
 moto cg first and second generation as well 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.450
 this box is a bit 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.890
 different from previous models is a 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:52.350
 because it is thinner to it. 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.300
 also different from the version that is sold 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.149
 on a motorhome you want your name to be a 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.039
 box a little bigger but at least this one here 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.270
 the power version with 16 gb of memory 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.399
 internal 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.040
 so has the lack of the appliance has 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.909
 a cover comes with the accompanying logo 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.040
 in motogp legislation and just have the look 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.700
 It's a little more different than it is 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.970
 normal here is some information here 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.450
 on the back we have been talking to 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:25.170
 existence water ip x7 instant camera 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.170
 3 megapixel with dual led cct flash 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.770
 what better is heart because I think it's 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.990
 a flash and it's hot I suffered a thing 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.500
 so you have to search the 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.049
 Front camera is 5 megapixels full hd 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.890
 the screen also remained hd of 5 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.340
 inches with the English language teacher 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.740
 410 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.399
 that's it he's gone broth 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.500
 small shop bought he knows right then 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.979
 Opening already has an orgy here in the version 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.469
 black a brief you will also have a 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:02.009
 yes you can in the white version here in the 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.960
 Singing check channel just for you 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.409
 that comes in the box has this walk that 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.410
 is also colorful 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:12.610
 This is it, leaving here the corner already 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.290
 We saw a motorola shell in blue that 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.280
 oblige what is really cool is the same 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:21.250
 texture in the last version the pt was soft 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.769
 and the colored ones were a bit plastic 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.340
 is that it is not the same as the 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.110
 two 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.760
 We do not even have the headphones here. 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.959
 of the motorola that is the same as the version 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.849
 last 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.049
 I do not particularly think that dream 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.569
 good 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:42.720
 He's not comfortable at all, either. 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:46.180
 finally in the called package we have a 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.470
 travel charger that is different from the 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.470
 previous models 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.129
 He's white for anyone who wants to see 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:57.640
 Amperage I do not know how to say it here 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:58.870
 is that we have usb cable also in color 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.140
 white 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.780
 You can see here that it seems to have a 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.410
 cool quality is the same car that 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.150
 came in their previous versions 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.760
 and here are some more manuals, right? 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.700
 motogp to you teach put put and 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.160
 take off talking about chips in 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.620
 interface is that a smart second 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.569
 So that's it, let's just 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.470
 he has here a film saying that 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.560
 he's 4g 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.569
 there its versions of the new module g 4 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.669
 This version is very interesting. 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.819
 16 GB of internal memory 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:37.090
 ep x 7 certification 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:39.069
 he is a run-out microsim of the then 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.680
 This is really cool so you take the 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.660
 of the device and make the first 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:50.519
 of the team before showing here a 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:55.090
 little designer and cool to see 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:57.880
 the parents but this time the mystery is 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.069
 only on the bottom that came out like this 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.530
 for the music is up here just for 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:05.109
 call we have the camera here 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.569
 frontal that is very interesting he has 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:10.930
 a very cool footprint that goal very fast 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:13.810
 even more so by the texture that 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.180
 from behind it's very comfortable I liked it 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.109
 enough people here already have a 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.829
 movie 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:23.680
 where he talks about how to put and 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:26.080
 cover and you have to put 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.000
 when it is time to raise a problem 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.500
 here on this side of us we have a button 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.270
 power that has a texture well 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.909
 interesting to different buttons 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.430
 volume, especially when you are in the 

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:39.400
 dark to the top we have the entrance 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:42.659
 for earphone a microphone of this 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:46.360
 There is nothing at all and here on the bottom only the 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:46.990
 we have to remove the 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.479
 cover 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.759
 Let's feel it here it 's very easy. 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:52.900
 mainly in relation to the models 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:54.699
 ancient 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.580
 We can already see here has the protection 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:59.740
 for the sd card I know which one to decide 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.360
 here to enter 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.949
 So this is really cool so just giving 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.379
 a look back here we have here 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:08.259
 in that metal that piquet around the lake 

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:10.779
 on the motorola of the dual flash camera 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:14.710
 here we have the input that yes Pocinho 

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:16.990
 two and one micro sd card up to 32 days 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.849
 I 'm not mistaken 64 you have to take a look 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.690
 in this we see that here behind good 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:24.370
 and is not plastic sun or if it is 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:28.180
 well resistant because it does not look like it 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.900
 Easter eg Version 2014 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.009
 appliance 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.469
 so this is it people I'm going to put 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:34.419
 You suck the baby smelling for you to see 

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:37.930
 how is it 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:41.889
 it's just you put it right here in tight 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:44.919
 enough for the danger of getting water and 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:47.349
 This is another day in the black version with 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:49.479
 Blue motogp was quite stylish I 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:53.969
 particularly close to you already 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:55.719

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:04.300
 people have to tighten up is in no way 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.599
 when you happen to fall into the 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:09.639
 happened on the appliance then this 

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:12.370
 which is the home screen when you call 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:15.189

00:06:50.899 --> 00:06:54.919
 third generation 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:55.909
 The interesting thing was already sent a

 available on the market 

00:07:16.369 --> 00:07:20.959
