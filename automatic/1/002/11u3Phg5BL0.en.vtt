executive<00:00:28.220> paul<00:00:29.210> otellini<00:00:33.190> we<00:00:34.190> started<00:00:34.550> out

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
executive paul otellini we started out

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.100 
executive paul otellini we started out
thinking<00:00:34.850> that<00:00:35.210> this<00:00:35.300> was<00:00:35.480> all<00:00:35.600> about<00:00:35.690> chips

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
thinking that this was all about chips

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.799 
thinking that this was all about chips
and<00:00:36.379> it<00:00:36.920> still<00:00:37.160> is<00:00:37.370> in<00:00:37.580> some<00:00:37.790> sense<00:00:38.000> but<00:00:38.629> it's

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
and it still is in some sense but it's

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.049 
and it still is in some sense but it's
also<00:00:38.989> all<00:00:39.260> about<00:00:39.500> platforms<00:00:40.100> and<00:00:40.340> we've<00:00:40.879> now

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
also all about platforms and we've now

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.330 
also all about platforms and we've now
developed<00:00:41.239> a<00:00:41.600> platform<00:00:42.080> around<00:00:42.500> the<00:00:42.680> the<00:00:43.010> atom

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
developed a platform around the the atom

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.299 
developed a platform around the the atom
