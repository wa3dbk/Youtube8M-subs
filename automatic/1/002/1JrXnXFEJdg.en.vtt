00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.370
 hello you do not have to give this Christmas 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.130
 and he makes watch this video and learn how to 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.730
 do a will with your label or the 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.730
 bracelet 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.580
 the materials that you will need with 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:18.350
 scissors 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.350
 Lockable 20 cm 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.760
 a bag of sabritas 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.940
 and you have to measure the bands 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.420
 so 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.820
 if you're not going to get the closure of what 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.400
 that they will look at your return from xavi as well 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.829
 we will need needles 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:49.309
 and the color of the bag of sabritas 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:53.379
 The first thing we are going to do is take it 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.379
 the label and wash the sachet 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.070
 once we have our clean 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.550
 sachet 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.420
 let's good we cut it so it's 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.630
 the width of the y 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.840
 and it looks like a sheet of paper after 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.580
 We're going to need the contact, I do not know if 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.399
 I mentioned it in the video but 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.399
 we will need to cut and well let's 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.150
 to measure our turn 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.280
 and we are going to cut the size 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.640
 and good when we cut the context 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.380
 we are going to line in front and by the 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.740
 opposite side of our bag of 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.740
 sabritas 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.510
 well we have our bag 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.720
 sabritas embroidered by the part of the 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:58.830
 and the one in front now what we're going to 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.040
 to do is to double back as they were 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.040
 and you 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:07.850
 and what we're going to do is we're going to 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:11.120
 fold in and from here we're going to 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.430
 make a small bend that is not so 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.890
 thick and with our thread and needle we go 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.550
 to start sewing this part 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:22.520
 let's sew this part with this with 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:26.900
 small stitches and the same thing we're going to 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:30.050
 do on the other side let's make a 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:34.240
 small doubles and let's do 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:37.300
 well we have this cooked 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.240
 and so on both sides and now what 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.060
 we are going to do is that 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.180
 let's check how it is 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:48.170
 the small bag of sabritas and we are going to sew 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:51.319
 our closing of this part only 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.080
 let's stick it to what is the fold 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:57.319
 that there were that we had cooked and what 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.829
 we will return to again and take 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:03.230
 until the end and the same thing we're going to do 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:05.599
 with the part on this side we're going to 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.829
 do also so that we have the 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:08.829
 close in between 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:18.820
 well we'll see if it 's from one part and 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.480
 has to be almost stuck to what it is 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:26.220
 the closure good and good the same thing we're going to 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.220
 do with the back 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:33.700
 good since we have both cooked 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.300
 parties we can do this already 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.300
 two 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:43.250
 and then we're going to flip our bag 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:46.180
 of sabritas with care if you want to 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.180
 not so careful 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.600
 and we are going to put 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:00.650
 and then what we are going to do is 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:04.030
 own the top part 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.030
 bottom of both sides 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:11.200
 good and once we have the 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:15.440
 cooked ends we will be this 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:17.720
 pen or cosmetiquera as they call it and 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:22.160
 would be a good option to give this 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:24.100
 24 December 25 if you do not buy fabric is 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.820
 a nice detail you can use colors 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.400
 cosmetics 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.230
 and I put this detail only cut 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.450
 a bit of hair you can put a 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.660
 and put it in for the crime of 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:41.000
 close you make him a nolito you know him and 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:43.100
 It is already to facilitate that you close the bag 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.500
