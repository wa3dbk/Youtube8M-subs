we<00:00:29.140> both<00:00:29.350> grew<00:00:29.529> up<00:00:29.680> on<00:00:29.859> farms<00:00:30.100> so<00:00:30.550> we're<00:00:30.730> very

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
we both grew up on farms so we're very

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:38.019 
rhythms of farm life and ultimately we

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:39.660 
rhythms of farm life and ultimately we
just<00:00:38.199> wanted<00:00:38.379> to<00:00:38.440> get<00:00:38.589> back<00:00:38.710> to<00:00:38.920> that<00:00:39.070> and<00:00:39.400> do

up about a half a mile north of here and
we<00:00:53.080> had<00:00:53.350> just<00:00:53.440> been<00:00:53.650> looking<00:00:53.799> kind<00:00:54.400> of<00:00:54.580> just

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
we had just been looking kind of just

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.000 
we had just been looking kind of just
looking<00:00:55.780> around<00:00:55.900> not<00:00:56.290> really<00:00:56.320> seriously

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
looking around not really seriously

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.119 
looking around not really seriously
online<00:00:57.640> at<00:00:58.000> farms<00:00:58.780> not<00:00:59.409> really<00:00:59.680> knowing<00:00:59.860> if<00:01:00.100> we

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
online at farms not really knowing if we

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:02.789 
online at farms not really knowing if we
were<00:01:00.250> exactly<00:01:00.760> ready<00:01:01.059> yet<00:01:01.360> and<00:01:01.690> then<00:01:01.869> this<00:01:02.589> one

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:02.799 
were exactly ready yet and then this one

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:06.120 
were exactly ready yet and then this one
popped<00:01:03.159> up<00:01:03.400> and<00:01:03.699> it<00:01:04.030> was<00:01:04.900> right<00:01:05.320> by<00:01:05.500> where<00:01:05.740> you

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
popped up and it was right by where you

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.609 
popped up and it was right by where you
know<00:01:06.520> both<00:01:06.729> of<00:01:06.760> our<00:01:06.940> families<00:01:07.390> are<00:01:07.720> closed<00:01:08.229> so

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619

with farming and and you know just

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.440 
with farming and and you know just
really<00:01:41.770> what<00:01:42.340> your<00:01:42.460> values<00:01:42.820> are<00:01:42.969> and<00:01:43.149> what<00:01:43.359> it

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:45.429 
is inside that will motivate you to be

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:47.190 
is inside that will motivate you to be
able<00:01:45.520> to<00:01:45.640> deal<00:01:45.880> with<00:01:46.090> having<00:01:46.450> a<00:01:46.509> farm<00:01:46.749> I<00:01:46.960> guess

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
able to deal with having a farm I guess

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.039 
able to deal with having a farm I guess

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
and so you know farm beginnings first

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:53.429 
and so you know farm beginnings first
was<00:01:50.619> just<00:01:51.039> kind<00:01:51.249> of<00:01:51.659> getting<00:01:52.659> our<00:01:52.869> mindset

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
was just kind of getting our mindset

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:56.429 
was just kind of getting our mindset
ready<00:01:53.740> to<00:01:54.189> to<00:01:54.789> handle<00:01:55.210> these<00:01:55.299> things<00:01:55.439> after

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
ready to to handle these things after

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:59.370 
ready to to handle these things after
that<00:01:56.770> it<00:01:56.950> was<00:01:57.069> it<00:01:57.340> was<00:01:57.549> more<00:01:57.909> of<00:01:58.119> you<00:01:58.840> know<00:01:58.960> a

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:01.749 
sort of force from behind to make sure

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:03.870 
sort of force from behind to make sure
that<00:02:01.929> you<00:02:02.049> have<00:02:02.259> structure<00:02:03.249> make<00:02:03.639> sure<00:02:03.759> your
