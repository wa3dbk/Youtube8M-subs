00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:01.509
 Hello everyone 

00:00:01.509 --> 00:00:04.900
 so today I will try to interpret the dedÃ© songs 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.910
 without wanting to make play on words 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.319
 violent villedubert 

00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:09.249
 a song of his 

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:11.149
 my next album 

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:14.239
 in this sense the participation of the head of state 

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:16.900
 people have to stand together 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.619
 I am proud to be French 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.689
 so every month I read I'm just above our heads 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.480
 until there 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.630
 so it's useless to want to denounce him 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.229
 what shocked me the most I'm going to galley 

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:33.229
 here are also watch all the movies 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.500
 in the wound 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.430
 in their study 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.060
 he is the director 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:33.949
 here for the benefit 

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:35.190
 for his lawyer 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.339
 - in the first part of his challenge 

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:40.339
 the lawyer of georges tron 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.039
 other statistic go on the chain
