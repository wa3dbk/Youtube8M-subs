00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
little fun fact when I first started

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.980 
little fun fact when I first started
collecting<00:01:39.640> that<00:01:39.970> was<00:01:40.180> actually<00:01:40.630> my<00:01:40.810> favorite

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
collecting that was actually my favorite

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.520

silhouette<00:01:41.650> as<00:01:42.580> far<00:01:42.880> as<00:01:42.970> Jordans<00:01:43.390> go<00:01:43.570> I'm<00:01:44.140> not

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
silhouette as far as Jordans go I'm not

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.580 
silhouette as far as Jordans go I'm not
sure<00:01:44.770> why<00:01:45.330> the<00:01:46.330> shoe<00:01:46.480> received<00:01:47.020> a<00:01:47.110> lot<00:01:47.260> of<00:01:47.290> hate

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
sure why the shoe received a lot of hate

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:48.930 
sure why the shoe received a lot of hate
and<00:01:47.890> that's<00:01:48.040> I<00:01:48.130> think<00:01:48.160> that's<00:01:48.550> kind<00:01:48.760> of<00:01:48.790> what

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
and that's I think that's kind of what

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.360 
and that's I think that's kind of what
life<00:01:49.180> did<00:01:49.360> because<00:01:49.690> I<00:01:49.930> feel<00:01:50.650> like<00:01:50.680> the<00:01:50.890> two<00:01:51.070> was

release that's the determining factor

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.369

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
support blue which is actually like well

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.030 
support blue which is actually like well
it<00:03:58.190> looks<00:03:58.340> like<00:03:58.400> to<00:03:58.609> me<00:03:58.639> just<00:03:59.269> true<00:03:59.569> blue<00:04:00.040> with

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
it looks like to me just true blue with

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.009 
it looks like to me just true blue with
the<00:04:01.159> black<00:04:01.340> bass<00:04:01.609> and<00:04:01.790> several<00:04:02.120> white<00:04:02.299> now

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
the black bass and several white now

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.349 
the black bass and several white now
that's<00:04:03.949> kind<00:04:04.159> of<00:04:04.220> if<00:04:04.489> you<00:04:04.639> release<00:04:04.879> for<00:04:05.090> me<00:04:05.180> to

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:05.359 
that's kind of if you release for me to

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:06.969 
that's kind of if you release for me to
now<00:04:05.510> I<00:04:05.540> think<00:04:05.659> about<00:04:06.079> this<00:04:06.290> there's<00:04:06.859> some

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:06.979 
now I think about this there's some

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:09.429 
now I think about this there's some
effect<00:04:07.310> that<00:04:07.549> when<00:04:08.269> it<00:04:08.389> comes<00:04:08.540> to<00:04:08.720> threes<00:04:09.109> I

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:09.439 
effect that when it comes to threes I

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:12.069 
effect that when it comes to threes I
think<00:04:10.340> earth<00:04:10.579> tones<00:04:10.970> complement<00:04:11.959> that

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
think earth tones complement that

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:13.659 
think earth tones complement that
silhouette<00:04:12.319> the<00:04:12.560> best<00:04:12.769> this<00:04:13.040> is<00:04:13.220> my<00:04:13.370> opinion

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:13.669 
silhouette the best this is my opinion

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:16.210 
silhouette the best this is my opinion
but<00:04:14.359> you<00:04:14.419> know<00:04:14.629> the<00:04:15.019> black<00:04:15.260> sea<00:04:15.470> man<00:04:15.680> the

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
but you know the black sea man the

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.099 
but you know the black sea man the
elephant<00:04:16.669> print<00:04:16.970> those<00:04:17.299> are<00:04:17.449> all<00:04:17.570> earth<00:04:17.810> tones

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
elephant print those are all earth tones

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.240 
elephant print those are all earth tones
even<00:04:18.409> the<00:04:19.370> mochas<00:04:20.229> crazy<00:04:21.229> three<00:04:21.709> and<00:04:21.949> that's

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
even the mochas crazy three and that's

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.100 
even the mochas crazy three and that's
the<00:04:22.340> earth<00:04:22.460> tunnel<00:04:22.849> so<00:04:23.000> I<00:04:23.300> think<00:04:23.630> when<00:04:23.990> it

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
the earth tunnel so I think when it

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.420 
the earth tunnel so I think when it
comes<00:04:24.229> to<00:04:24.409> that<00:04:24.560> you<00:04:24.650> know<00:04:24.770> that<00:04:24.919> blue<00:04:25.130> is<00:04:25.250> kind

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
comes to that you know that blue is kind

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.950 
comes to that you know that blue is kind
of<00:04:25.460> throwing<00:04:25.669> it<00:04:25.849> off<00:04:25.970> of<00:04:26.120> me<00:04:26.270> I'm<00:04:26.690> not<00:04:26.840> sure

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
of throwing it off of me I'm not sure

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.510 
of throwing it off of me I'm not sure
have<00:04:27.169> some<00:04:27.349> sit<00:04:27.590> well<00:04:27.770> with<00:04:27.800> that<00:04:28.039> black<00:04:28.250> bass

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
have some sit well with that black bass

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.520 
have some sit well with that black bass
