00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
that you can you can only design what

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
you can draw you know if you can't draw

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.090 
you can draw you know if you can't draw
how<00:00:36.780> can<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.079> design<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:37.980> can<00:00:38.040> anything

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
how can you design and you can anything

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.450 
how can you design and you can anything
it's<00:00:41.100> different<00:00:41.640> now<00:00:42.739> with<00:00:43.739> computers

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
it's different now with computers

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.970 
it's different now with computers
because<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.719> can<00:00:45.960> design<00:00:46.140> things<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.739> you

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
because you can design things that you

so<00:01:02.399> arid<00:01:02.820> designs<00:01:03.270> have<00:01:03.600> mutated<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.500> evolved

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
so arid designs have mutated and evolved

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.420 
so arid designs have mutated and evolved

questions is this what you want and

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.190 
questions is this what you want and
they'll<00:02:23.209> say<00:02:23.330> no<00:02:23.450> this<00:02:23.540> is<00:02:23.690> how<00:02:23.780> we<00:02:23.840> want<00:02:24.050> it

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
they'll say no this is how we want it

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.729 
they'll say no this is how we want it
and<00:02:24.489> it<00:02:25.489> boils<00:02:25.940> down<00:02:26.030> at<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:27.080> end<00:02:27.230> to

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
and it boils down at the end to

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.400 
and it boils down at the end to
something<00:02:28.520> is<00:02:28.760> concise<00:02:29.630> and<00:02:30.080> almost

generally<00:02:36.350> we'll<00:02:37.130> start<00:02:37.489> with<00:02:37.640> this<00:02:37.790> because

the problem with just sketching in a

purely creative way is potentially quite

purely creative way is potentially quite

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.590 
wasteful to disengage from the too
disengaged<00:02:46.700> and<00:02:47.000> you<00:02:47.120> could<00:02:47.270> end<00:02:47.390> up<00:02:47.480> with

something beautiful and fantastic and

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.550 
something beautiful and fantastic and
you<00:02:50.209> look<00:02:50.330> at<00:02:50.420> it<00:02:50.510> but<00:02:50.660> you<00:02:50.930> just<00:02:50.959> can't<00:02:51.350> make

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
you look at it but you just can't make

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.059 
you look at it but you just can't make
it<00:02:51.620> work

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
it work

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.369

the first schematic diagram is turned

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:57.259 
the first schematic diagram is turned

into a picture of basic building blocks
purely<00:02:57.840> to<00:02:57.959> show<00:02:58.140> how<00:02:58.319> the<00:02:58.379> building<00:02:58.739> might

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:02.939 
function when does Ron get his hands on

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:04.729 
function when does Ron get his hands on
it<00:03:03.120> this<00:03:03.359> is<00:03:03.510> where<00:03:03.659> everyone<00:03:04.019> and<00:03:04.379> the<00:03:04.560> team

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
it this is where everyone and the team

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:05.809 
it this is where everyone and the team
of<00:03:04.829> architects<00:03:05.219> will<00:03:05.310> work<00:03:05.430> very<00:03:05.459> closely

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
of architects will work very closely

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.819 
of architects will work very closely
together<00:03:06.060> so<00:03:06.810> this<00:03:06.900> is<00:03:07.049> one<00:03:07.200> of<00:03:07.319> the<00:03:07.409> critical

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
together so this is one of the critical

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.009 
together so this is one of the critical
moments<00:03:08.219> in<00:03:08.310> bringing<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:09.239> more<00:03:09.420> conceptual

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
moments in bringing the more conceptual

moments in bringing the more conceptual
sketchy<00:03:10.349> side<00:03:10.739> of<00:03:10.890> it<00:03:10.980> into<00:03:11.159> this<00:03:11.640> very<00:03:12.480> dry

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
sketchy side of it into this very dry

sketchy side of it into this very dry
building<00:03:13.920> block<00:03:14.159> side<00:03:14.489> of<00:03:14.609> it<00:03:14.730> we<00:03:15.689> don't<00:03:15.900> use

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
building block side of it we don't use

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.869 
building block side of it we don't use
traditional<00:03:16.170> mediums<00:03:16.799> so<00:03:17.189> it's<00:03:17.489> not<00:03:17.640> using

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:17.879 
traditional mediums so it's not using

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:22.250 
traditional mediums so it's not using
pencils<00:03:18.329> and<00:03:18.450> paper<00:03:18.739> ron<00:03:19.739> has<00:03:19.980> a<00:03:21.019> sketch<00:03:22.019> pad

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
pencils and paper ron has a sketch pad

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.080 
pencils and paper ron has a sketch pad
which<00:03:22.950> is<00:03:22.980> a<00:03:23.299> digital<00:03:24.299> sketching<00:03:24.719> pad<00:03:24.959> I<00:03:26.090> was

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
which is a digital sketching pad I was

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.940 
which is a digital sketching pad I was
surprised<00:03:27.480> that<00:03:27.659> Ron's<00:03:27.959> sketch<00:03:28.409> comes<00:03:28.799> at

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
surprised that Ron's sketch comes at

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.770 
surprised that Ron's sketch comes at
this<00:03:29.159> stage<00:03:29.519> when<00:03:29.970> lots<00:03:30.150> of<00:03:30.299> practical

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
this stage when lots of practical

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.690 
this stage when lots of practical
decisions<00:03:31.200> have<00:03:31.319> already<00:03:31.470> been<00:03:31.680> made<00:03:31.799> so

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
decisions have already been made so

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.190 
decisions have already been made so
although<00:03:32.849> these<00:03:33.090> sketches<00:03:33.389> may<00:03:33.720> look<00:03:33.989> like

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
although these sketches may look like

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.899 
although these sketches may look like
fantasy<00:03:34.739> there's<00:03:35.159> a<00:03:35.220> lot<00:03:35.370> of<00:03:35.489> practical

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:35.909 
fantasy there's a lot of practical

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:37.699 
fantasy there's a lot of practical
information<00:03:36.180> already<00:03:36.900> contained<00:03:37.470> within

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
information already contained within

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.869 
information already contained within
them<00:03:39.620> happens<00:03:40.620> after<00:03:40.980> that<00:03:41.010> this<00:03:41.639> is<00:03:41.790> this

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
them happens after that this is this

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:43.819 
them happens after that this is this
this<00:03:42.180> is<00:03:42.239> the<00:03:42.510> starting<00:03:42.900> to<00:03:42.989> sketch<00:03:43.230> in<00:03:43.409> 3d

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
this is the starting to sketch in 3d

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.830 
this is the starting to sketch in 3d
work<00:03:44.250> so<00:03:44.609> Ron<00:03:44.939> and<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:45.090> team<00:03:45.299> will<00:03:45.419> be<00:03:45.450> working

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
work so Ron and the team will be working

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.539 
work so Ron and the team will be working
together<00:03:45.959> and<00:03:46.500> you'll<00:03:46.739> be<00:03:46.829> started<00:03:47.129> just<00:03:47.310> move

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
together and you'll be started just move

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.129 
together and you'll be started just move
things<00:03:47.730> around<00:03:47.939> in<00:03:48.329> three<00:03:48.540> dimensions<00:03:48.989> to

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
things around in three dimensions to

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.429 
things around in three dimensions to
start<00:03:49.379> to<00:03:49.500> get<00:03:49.560> an<00:03:49.680> understanding

00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:51.439 
start to get an understanding

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:54.190 
start to get an understanding
for<00:03:52.400> all<00:03:52.459> the<00:03:52.939> bats<00:03:53.150> on<00:03:53.299> a<00:03:53.329> computer<00:03:53.870> and<00:03:54.109> it

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
for all the bats on a computer and it

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.190 
for all the bats on a computer and it
shows<00:03:54.409> a<00:03:54.439> very<00:03:54.680> special<00:03:55.099> age<00:03:55.189> building<00:03:55.609> to<00:03:55.730> me

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
shows a very special age building to me

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.770 
shows a very special age building to me
it's<00:03:57.200> still<00:03:57.469> essentially<00:03:58.010> a<00:03:58.780> Renaissance

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
it's still essentially a Renaissance

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.220 
it's still essentially a Renaissance
perspective<00:04:00.469> drawing<00:04:01.359> yes<00:04:02.359> but<00:04:02.629> the

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
perspective drawing yes but the

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:04.990 
perspective drawing yes but the
difference<00:04:03.379> is<00:04:03.739> that<00:04:03.769> instead<00:04:04.549> of<00:04:04.730> being<00:04:04.909> a

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
difference is that instead of being a

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.030 
difference is that instead of being a
single<00:04:05.209> point<00:04:05.540> of<00:04:05.689> view<00:04:05.810> it's<00:04:05.989> a<00:04:06.140> it's<00:04:06.680> a<00:04:06.769> we

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.469 
turn it upside down we can turn it
inside<00:04:14.540> out<00:04:14.569> even<00:04:15.820> I'd<00:04:16.820> assumed<00:04:17.209> that<00:04:17.299> was<00:04:17.449> the

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:21.759 
end of it how much more sophisticated
could<00:04:19.639> it<00:04:19.729> get<00:04:20.000> but<00:04:20.810> I<00:04:20.840> was<00:04:21.019> again<00:04:21.289> surprised

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
could it get but I was again surprised

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.860 
could it get but I was again surprised
to<00:04:21.979> learn<00:04:22.039> that<00:04:22.190> the<00:04:22.460> final<00:04:22.910> stage<00:04:23.210> was<00:04:23.690> what

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
to learn that the final stage was what

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.680 
to learn that the final stage was what
looked<00:04:24.020> like<00:04:24.199> simple<00:04:24.770> old-fashioned

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
looked like simple old-fashioned

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.900 
looked like simple old-fashioned
two-dimensional<00:04:26.690> drawings<00:04:27.729> so<00:04:28.729> your
