on<00:00:44.540> boats<00:00:44.809> are<00:00:45.140> more<00:00:45.410> noble<00:00:45.710> than<00:00:45.739> others

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
on boats are more noble than others

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.100 
on boats are more noble than others
which<00:00:46.760> is<00:00:46.910> a<00:00:46.940> characteristic<00:00:47.690> that<00:00:47.719> could

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
which is a characteristic that could

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.770 
which is a characteristic that could
contribute<00:00:48.410> to<00:00:48.649> corrosion<00:00:49.120> our<00:00:50.120> sail<00:00:50.420> boat<00:00:50.660> is

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
contribute to corrosion our sail boat is

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.540 
contribute to corrosion our sail boat is
a<00:00:50.809> model<00:00:51.230> that<00:00:51.260> can<00:00:51.500> help<00:00:51.680> demonstrate<00:00:52.070> this

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
a model that can help demonstrate this

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.930
