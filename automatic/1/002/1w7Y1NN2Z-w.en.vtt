00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.049
 Hello friends, I am Dima and 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.000
 Today I will show you the secrets and Easter eggs from 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:15.030
 various game such videos will 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.570
 called a collection of easter eggs is a release 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.580
 1 and I made the decision realizing that not 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.860
 all games have more than 1 or 2 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.840
 easter eggs and where there are very few of them 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.640
 It will be here in such collections 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.010
 but you must admit, it's pretty stupid 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.120
 will make a release on the game in which 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.699
 one or two easter eggs separately so I 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.620
 I decided to do this and the first 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:39.269
 Easter eggs are in the assassin's game 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.309
 creed 4 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:44.070
 if we wander around the appstore like that 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.820
 note a lot of references to the previous ones 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.010
 parts of the game ubisoft namely assassin's 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.690
 creed wandering a bit ops tenga 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.539
 you start to wonder if you got 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.149
 accidentally in studio yubisoft really 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.789
 It is scattered a lot of disk books 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.870
 posters and everything related to 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:06.420
 previous games from ubisoft studio 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:09.030
 In general, here are the cases here and maybe 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.350
 this is real yubisoft in another world in 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.630
 parallel universe 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.580
 I do not know when passing the task 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.610
 debris on touch and if we swim on 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.100
 wreck and swim as well yes 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.200
 Immediately she will start the cut-scene where we 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.330
 can see kraken who doesn't know it 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.940
 big myth animal exactly 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.800
 giant octopus is the same 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.870
 octopus can be seen in many more 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.090
 movies and games such as pirates 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:36.210
 the Caribbean either in the tomb raider game 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.340
 and by the way kraken was still in the previous one 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.180
 parts of the c since series are burning namely in 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.180
 assassin's creed 2 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.260
 The next Easter egg is already in the game. 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.660
 red dead redemption and now i am 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.880
 show you exactly where you can find it 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.460
 she is in a graveyard next to 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.380
 the city of black water here it is the city itself and 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:03.000
 here is a graveyard nearby and if we 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.800
 get accustomed to using sniper 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.060
 rifles to this from a monument in that 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.090
 we can see just such an interesting one 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.959
 inscription memory harrison chili which 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:16.439
 died December 7, 1968, age 24 years 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.540
 the strangest thing in this record is 1968 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:22.950
 although the game's events unfold in 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:25.349
 the beginning of the 20th century in 1910 dash 1920 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.209
 Here is such a mistake 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.249
 but since we started talking about red grandfather 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.739
 redemption then there is another easter egg in 

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:33.870
 the line or game of death in silk 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.730
 stockings we can find in the garbage can 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.540
 joe's hat on mars 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.079
 sending 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.420
 from rockstar cut phases in prologue by 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:44.519
 against a little housework we can find in 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.099
 one of the rooms is such a picture 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:49.439
 which I think will remind a lot 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.959
 to players who have already completed the game of one of 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:54.030
 scenes which will be further in the game and 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:57.180
 I think it's pretty weird because 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.129
 which is very much like that 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.939
 terrain I would even say a hundred 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:04.739
 percent is the same location and 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:09.209
 many years later we are just the same 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:13.569
 find ourselves in the same moment 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:15.760
 stupid and last for Easter 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.099
 is in the game beyond asos when we 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.860
 We walk around the city as the homeless 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:23.650
 we can notice one person who 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.980
 reads the newspaper if we switch to 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:30.400
 Aydana and see what he read there 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.440
 note a very interesting origami article 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.250
 killer 7 victims 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:39.010
 no clues here is such an article 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.780
 that is, we see something that events 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.750
 the game takes place at the same time as 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.760
 heavy rain or it's in my opinion and events 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.099
 games still bean tucson a little later than 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.970
 heavy rain and so I don't even know 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:53.920
 maybe those who played caught what 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.940
 maybe we didn't even catch it 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.540
 killer 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:01.120
 master of origami i don't really know 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.430
 but generally write your guesses in 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.620
 comments and thanks to all of this 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.849
