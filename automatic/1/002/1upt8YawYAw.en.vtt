hi I'm mark Richman I'm from chef knives
to<00:00:04.650> go<00:00:04.799> and<00:00:05.100> today<00:00:05.640> we're<00:00:05.759> going<00:00:05.850> to<00:00:05.910> talk

about<00:00:06.330> flattening<00:00:07.049> a<00:00:07.410> stone<00:00:07.919> this<00:00:08.790> is<00:00:08.849> a

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
about flattening a stone this is a

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.350 
about flattening a stone this is a
pretty<00:00:09.750> simple<00:00:10.230> concept<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.920> understand<00:00:11.429> when

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
pretty simple concept to understand when

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.799 
pretty simple concept to understand when
you're<00:00:12.570> grinding<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.559> knife<00:00:14.070> on<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.809> sharpening

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
you're grinding a knife on a sharpening

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.269 
you're grinding a knife on a sharpening
stone<00:00:16.400> what<00:00:17.400> tends<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.760> happen<00:00:17.880> is<00:00:18.330> you<00:00:19.279> grind

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
stone what tends to happen is you grind

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.660 
stone what tends to happen is you grind
more<00:00:20.760> material<00:00:21.449> in<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:22.470> middle<00:00:22.740> of<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.340> stone

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
more material in the middle of the stone

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.310 
more material in the middle of the stone
and<00:00:24.140> this<00:00:25.140> causes<00:00:25.880> warping<00:00:26.880> or<00:00:27.170> it's<00:00:28.170> actually

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
and this causes warping or it's actually

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.609 
and this causes warping or it's actually
called<00:00:28.740> dishing<00:00:29.279> common<00:00:30.179> term<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.929> dishing

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
called dishing common term and dishing

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.430 
called dishing common term and dishing
basically<00:00:32.430> means<00:00:32.910> just<00:00:33.239> what<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.540> sounds<00:00:34.380> like

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
basically means just what it sounds like

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.750 
basically means just what it sounds like
it<00:00:34.890> you're<00:00:35.700> basically<00:00:36.140> grinding<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.610> divot<00:00:38.610> in

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
it you're basically grinding a divot in

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.910 
it you're basically grinding a divot in
the<00:00:38.969> middle<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.570> stone<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.230> then<00:00:40.800> you

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
the middle of the stone and then you

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.020 
the middle of the stone and then you
have<00:00:41.040> high<00:00:41.600> edges<00:00:42.600> all<00:00:42.960> around<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.530> outside

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
have high edges all around the outside

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.180 
have high edges all around the outside
kind<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.149> like<00:00:45.300> this<00:00:45.539> this<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.410> main<00:00:46.739> area

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
kind of like this this is the main area

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.420 
kind of like this this is the main area
where<00:00:47.250> you're<00:00:48.090> going<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.539> be<00:00:49.250> sharpening<00:00:50.250> your

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
where you're going to be sharpening your

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.270 
where you're going to be sharpening your
stone<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.300> rest<00:00:51.570> will<00:00:51.890> form<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:53.010> little

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
stone and the rest will form a little

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.150 
stone and the rest will form a little
higher<00:00:53.550> edge<00:00:54.260> over<00:00:55.260> time<00:00:55.649> this<00:00:55.800> can<00:00:56.010> get

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
higher edge over time this can get

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.069 
higher edge over time this can get
severe<00:00:56.789> if<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.059> don't<00:00:57.239> do<00:00:57.420> anything<00:00:57.690> about<00:00:57.899> it

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
severe if you don't do anything about it

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.189 
severe if you don't do anything about it
and<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.590> affects<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.489> performance<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.449> your

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
and it affects the performance and your

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.119 
and it affects the performance and your
results<00:01:01.739> when<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.280> sharpen<00:01:02.960> so<00:01:03.960> I'm<00:01:04.890> going<00:01:05.100> to

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
results when you sharpen so I'm going to

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.109 
results when you sharpen so I'm going to
show<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.729> very<00:01:06.420> simple<00:01:06.810> way<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:08.119> flatten

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
show you is a very simple way to flatten

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.910 
show you is a very simple way to flatten

low<00:01:19.470> grit<00:01:19.920> very<00:01:20.610> rough<00:01:20.970> coarse<00:01:22.520> sandpaper<00:01:23.520> and

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
low grit very rough coarse sandpaper and

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.929 
low grit very rough coarse sandpaper and
you<00:01:24.570> can<00:01:24.810> sand<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.439> on<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.650> flat<00:01:26.009> put<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.700> paper

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
you can sand it on a flat put the paper

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.050 
you can sand it on a flat put the paper
on<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.210> flat<00:01:27.540> surface<00:01:27.890> take<00:01:28.890> your<00:01:29.070> stone<00:01:29.340> make

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
on a flat surface take your stone make

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.020 
on a flat surface take your stone make
believe<00:01:30.360> this<00:01:30.509> is<00:01:30.720> sandpaper<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.670> rub

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
believe this is sandpaper and you rub

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.910 
believe this is sandpaper and you rub
the<00:01:33.570> stone<00:01:33.869> on<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.470> sandpaper<00:01:35.930> if<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.380> I

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
the stone on the sandpaper if and I

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.010 
the stone on the sandpaper if and I
would<00:01:38.250> recommend<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:38.880> actually<00:01:39.360> if<00:01:39.750> you're

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
would recommend that actually if you're

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.300 
would recommend that actually if you're
just<00:01:40.259> getting<00:01:40.439> started

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
just getting started

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.420 
just getting started
it's<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.850> low-cost<00:01:42.299> way<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.659> try<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.100> later<00:01:44.100> on

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
it's a low-cost way to try it later on

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.600 
it's a low-cost way to try it later on
if<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.509> get<00:01:45.780> more<00:01:46.100> interested<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.220> sharpening

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
if you get more interested in sharpening

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.010 
if you get more interested in sharpening
and<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.119> know<00:01:48.240> you're<00:01:48.390> going<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.540> do<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.840> for<00:01:48.990> a

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
and you know you're going to do it for a

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.700 
and you know you're going to do it for a
while<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:50.189> go-to<00:01:51.020> method<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.380> use<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:53.509> DMT

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
while the go-to method is to use a DMT

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.609 
while the go-to method is to use a DMT
extra-extra<00:01:55.710> course<00:01:56.060> diamond<00:01:57.060> plate<00:01:57.619> these

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
extra-extra course diamond plate these

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.740 
extra-extra course diamond plate these
are<00:01:58.860> really<00:01:59.219> tough<00:02:01.070> aggressive<00:02:02.479> plates<00:02:03.479> you

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
are really tough aggressive plates you

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.800 
are really tough aggressive plates you
can<00:02:03.780> use<00:02:04.110> them<00:02:04.290> for<00:02:04.320> Stone<00:02:04.979> repair<00:02:05.810> chip

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
can use them for Stone repair chip

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.979 
can use them for Stone repair chip
removal<00:02:07.580> they<00:02:08.580> they<00:02:09.330> work<00:02:09.539> great<00:02:09.690> for<00:02:09.959> a

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
removal they they work great for a

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:10.580 
removal they they work great for a
number<00:02:10.259> of<00:02:10.289> things

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
number of things

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.589 
number of things
but<00:02:10.769> stone<00:02:11.220> flattening<00:02:11.760> they're<00:02:12.000> ideal<00:02:12.540> for

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
but stone flattening they're ideal for

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.490 
but stone flattening they're ideal for
so<00:02:13.379> the<00:02:14.220> idea<00:02:14.459> here<00:02:14.519> is<00:02:15.080> same<00:02:16.080> as<00:02:16.260> when<00:02:16.410> you

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
so the idea here is same as when you

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.850 
so the idea here is same as when you
sharpen<00:02:17.420> get<00:02:18.420> a<00:02:18.450> little<00:02:18.690> water<00:02:18.870> on<00:02:19.110> there<00:02:20.720> and

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
sharpen get a little water on there and

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.759 
sharpen get a little water on there and
you<00:02:22.860> want<00:02:23.040> to<00:02:23.160> put<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.269> plate<00:02:24.930> over<00:02:25.080> it<00:02:25.260> and

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
you want to put the plate over it and

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.710 
you want to put the plate over it and
you<00:02:26.160> just<00:02:26.190> kind<00:02:26.550> of<00:02:26.640> want<00:02:26.849> to<00:02:26.910> scrub<00:02:27.360> it<00:02:27.540> and

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
you just kind of want to scrub it and

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.259 
you just kind of want to scrub it and
you<00:02:28.290> don't<00:02:28.560> want<00:02:28.799> to<00:02:28.830> do<00:02:28.980> it<00:02:29.099> all<00:02:29.310> exactly<00:02:30.150> the

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
you don't want to do it all exactly the

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.940 
you don't want to do it all exactly the
same<00:02:30.420> way<00:02:30.780> kind<00:02:31.200> of<00:02:31.290> run<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.400> around<00:02:32.640> like<00:02:32.849> this

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
same way kind of run it around like this

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.750 
same way kind of run it around like this
and<00:02:34.950> right<00:02:35.190> away

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
and right away

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.990 
and right away
if<00:02:36.120> your<00:02:36.330> stone<00:02:36.720> is<00:02:36.750> dish<00:02:37.549> you'll<00:02:38.549> be<00:02:38.670> able<00:02:38.790> to

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
if your stone is dish you'll be able to

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.759 
if your stone is dish you'll be able to
tell<00:02:39.269> and<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:40.110> way<00:02:40.230> you're<00:02:40.500> able<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:40.860> tell<00:02:41.220> is

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
tell and the way you're able to tell is

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.449 
tell and the way you're able to tell is
usually<00:02:43.769> the<00:02:43.890> middle<00:02:44.250> area<00:02:44.610> won't<00:02:45.599> have<00:02:46.140> any

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
usually the middle area won't have any

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.580 
usually the middle area won't have any
chalky<00:02:47.459> buildup<00:02:48.060> or<00:02:48.269> they<00:02:48.959> call<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.230> some

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
chalky buildup or they call it some

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.500 
chalky buildup or they call it some
people<00:02:49.890> call<00:02:50.069> it<00:02:50.099> swarf<00:02:50.640> which<00:02:50.970> is<00:02:51.150> kind<00:02:51.360> of<00:02:51.390> a

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
people call it swarf which is kind of a

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.620 
people call it swarf which is kind of a
fun<00:02:51.750> word<00:02:52.519> you<00:02:53.519> won't<00:02:53.640> see<00:02:53.970> very<00:02:54.180> much<00:02:54.420> of<00:02:54.599> that

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
fun word you won't see very much of that

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.030 
fun word you won't see very much of that
in<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.930> middle<00:02:55.110> you'll<00:02:55.440> see<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:55.799> on<00:02:55.890> the

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
in the middle you'll see it on the

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.830 
in the middle you'll see it on the
outsides<00:02:56.459> and<00:02:56.760> what<00:02:57.150> you<00:02:57.239> want<00:02:57.420> to<00:02:57.510> do<00:02:57.599> is<00:02:57.720> you

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
outsides and what you want to do is you

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.110 
outsides and what you want to do is you
want<00:02:58.019> to<00:02:58.049> just<00:02:58.110> keep<00:02:58.410> flattening<00:02:59.010> until<00:02:59.430> the

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
want to just keep flattening until the

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.839 
want to just keep flattening until the
whole<00:03:00.329> surface<00:03:00.629> starts<00:03:01.470> to<00:03:01.650> get<00:03:01.799> muddy<00:03:02.160> at<00:03:02.610> the

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
whole surface starts to get muddy at the

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:11.360 
whole surface starts to get muddy at the
same<00:03:03.060> time<00:03:09.079> how<00:03:10.079> long<00:03:10.319> you<00:03:10.500> do<00:03:10.650> this<00:03:10.799> depends

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
same time how long you do this depends

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.180 
same time how long you do this depends
on<00:03:11.489> how<00:03:11.670> often<00:03:11.940> you<00:03:12.530> flatten<00:03:13.530> your<00:03:13.709> stones<00:03:13.980> and

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
on how often you flatten your stones and

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.670 
on how often you flatten your stones and
what<00:03:14.340> kind<00:03:14.549> of<00:03:14.579> stone<00:03:14.850> you<00:03:15.000> use<00:03:15.470> this<00:03:16.470> is<00:03:16.650> a

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
what kind of stone you use this is a

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.890 
what kind of stone you use this is a
brand<00:03:17.010> new<00:03:17.160> stone<00:03:17.489> I<00:03:17.519> used<00:03:18.090> it<00:03:18.239> yesterday<00:03:18.450> on

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
brand new stone I used it yesterday on

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.550 
brand new stone I used it yesterday on
our<00:03:19.130> lesson<00:03:20.130> number<00:03:20.250> two<00:03:20.609> so<00:03:21.510> it's<00:03:21.810> almost

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
our lesson number two so it's almost

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.390 
our lesson number two so it's almost
completely<00:03:23.280> flat<00:03:23.609> and<00:03:25.160> what<00:03:26.160> I<00:03:26.190> would

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
completely flat and what I would

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.199 
completely flat and what I would
recommend<00:03:26.549> is<00:03:27.150> that<00:03:27.180> you<00:03:27.569> do<00:03:27.780> a<00:03:27.810> brief<00:03:28.260> short

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
recommend is that you do a brief short

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.490 
recommend is that you do a brief short
flattening<00:03:30.209> session<00:03:30.720> right<00:03:30.989> before<00:03:31.349> you

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
flattening session right before you

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.039 
flattening session right before you
start<00:03:31.950> to<00:03:32.160> sharpen<00:03:32.639> your<00:03:32.700> knives<00:03:33.030> that<00:03:33.810> way

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
start to sharpen your knives that way

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.280 
start to sharpen your knives that way
you'll<00:03:34.650> avoid<00:03:34.739> the<00:03:35.250> dishing<00:03:36.049> you'll<00:03:37.049> know

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
you'll avoid the dishing you'll know

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.979 
you'll avoid the dishing you'll know
it's<00:03:37.500> flat<00:03:37.739> and<00:03:38.160> you're<00:03:38.400> ready<00:03:38.639> to<00:03:38.700> go<00:03:38.989> the

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
it's flat and you're ready to go the

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.589 
it's flat and you're ready to go the
other<00:03:40.109> thing<00:03:40.410> that<00:03:40.440> you<00:03:40.709> should<00:03:41.239> pay<00:03:42.239> a<00:03:42.269> little

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
other thing that you should pay a little

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.530 
other thing that you should pay a little
attention<00:03:42.900> to<00:03:43.260> is<00:03:43.709> the<00:03:43.919> edges<00:03:44.310> here<00:03:44.639> and<00:03:44.819> you

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
attention to is the edges here and you

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.740 
attention to is the edges here and you
should<00:03:45.720> just<00:03:45.840> try<00:03:46.079> to<00:03:46.109> round<00:03:46.530> these<00:03:46.739> two<00:03:47.069> edges

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
should just try to round these two edges

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.089 
should just try to round these two edges
some<00:03:48.750> people<00:03:49.019> round<00:03:49.260> all<00:03:49.470> four<00:03:49.769> and<00:03:49.919> there's

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
some people round all four and there's

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.099 
some people round all four and there's
no<00:03:50.250> problem<00:03:50.609> with<00:03:50.639> that<00:03:50.910> I<00:03:51.120> find<00:03:51.930> when<00:03:52.079> I

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
no problem with that I find when I

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:55.520 
no problem with that I find when I
sharpen<00:03:52.680> I<00:03:52.859> don't<00:03:53.639> ever<00:03:53.790> use<00:03:53.880> this<00:03:54.510> edge<00:03:54.930> on

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
sharpen I don't ever use this edge on

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.500 
sharpen I don't ever use this edge on
the<00:03:55.769> top<00:03:55.799> and<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:56.250> bottom<00:03:56.430> so<00:03:56.760> I<00:03:57.299> don't

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
the top and the bottom so I don't

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.059 
the top and the bottom so I don't
usually<00:03:57.750> pay<00:03:58.139> a<00:03:58.169> lot<00:03:58.349> of<00:03:58.380> attention<00:03:58.500> to<00:03:58.950> that

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
usually pay a lot of attention to that

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.990 
usually pay a lot of attention to that
so<00:03:59.430> to<00:04:00.329> round<00:04:00.660> the<00:04:00.870> edges<00:04:01.010> simple<00:04:02.010> you<00:04:02.819> can

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
so to round the edges simple you can

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.070 
so to round the edges simple you can
just<00:04:03.030> take<00:04:03.419> these<00:04:03.630> stone<00:04:05.540> and<00:04:06.540> I<00:04:07.500> just<00:04:07.889> kind<00:04:08.099> of

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
just take these stone and I just kind of

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.000 
just take these stone and I just kind of
move<00:04:09.650> it<00:04:09.860> back<00:04:10.070> and<00:04:10.280> forth<00:04:10.370> to<00:04:10.880> round<00:04:11.270> the<00:04:11.900> edge

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
move it back and forth to round the edge

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.280 
move it back and forth to round the edge
some<00:04:13.400> people<00:04:13.730> just<00:04:13.760> kick<00:04:14.240> it<00:04:14.390> on<00:04:14.480> an<00:04:14.660> angle<00:04:14.810> and

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
some people just kick it on an angle and

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.880 
some people just kick it on an angle and
they<00:04:15.680> basically<00:04:16.930> just<00:04:17.930> take<00:04:18.170> the<00:04:18.320> corner<00:04:18.620> off

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
they basically just take the corner off

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.490 
they basically just take the corner off
either<00:04:19.519> methods<00:04:20.060> fine<00:04:20.330> but<00:04:20.660> I<00:04:20.930> find<00:04:21.440> that

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
either methods fine but I find that

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.300 
either methods fine but I find that
rounding<00:04:22.010> edge<00:04:23.080> makes<00:04:24.080> a<00:04:24.230> little<00:04:25.040> more<00:04:25.250> sense

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
rounding edge makes a little more sense

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.020 
rounding edge makes a little more sense
to<00:04:25.640> me<00:04:25.960> so<00:04:26.960> you<00:04:27.020> just<00:04:27.170> do<00:04:27.320> that<00:04:27.440> on<00:04:27.500> both<00:04:27.710> sides

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
to me so you just do that on both sides

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.000 
to me so you just do that on both sides
it's<00:04:29.030> good<00:04:29.210> to<00:04:29.360> alternate<00:04:29.960> sides<00:04:30.380> when<00:04:30.830> you're

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
it's good to alternate sides when you're

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.190 
it's good to alternate sides when you're
when<00:04:31.760> you're<00:04:31.790> flattening<00:04:32.180> the<00:04:32.450> stone<00:04:32.690> to<00:04:32.930> just

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
when you're flattening the stone to just

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.320 
when you're flattening the stone to just
to<00:04:33.290> keep<00:04:33.440> it<00:04:33.620> nice<00:04:33.740> and<00:04:33.980> flat<00:04:34.160> and<00:04:34.430> that's<00:04:35.150> all

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
to keep it nice and flat and that's all
