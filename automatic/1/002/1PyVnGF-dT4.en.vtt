00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:27.440
 ingredients for real sugar fat 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.020
 glas of egg white and lemon juice 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.270
 [Music] 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.930
 first we sieve the sugar

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.740
 next we put the egg white 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.040
 in a bowl and beat until it's a 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.700
 snow point 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.190
 [Music] 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.510
 reached the snow point we add the 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.510
 lemon juice and mix 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.089
 then we are adding sugar 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.769
 glas little by little while continuing to beat 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:04.060
 we add a little sugar and once 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:07.189
 has been incorporated we add a little more 

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.189
 [Music] 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.770
 as we add sugar the 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:21.750
 mixture will thicken 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:24.000
 [Music] 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.900
 once we have our list ready 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.790
 real 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.400
 we can use a food coloring 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.310
 to color 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.740
 we separate the glaze from as many parts as 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.870
 dyes we want to use 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.240
 and 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:42.030
 we only have one sleeve left 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.200
 pastry to apply the fat and 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:02:13.640
 decorate to our liking 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:02:16.330
