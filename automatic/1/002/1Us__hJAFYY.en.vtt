Jerusalem<00:01:50.049> I<00:01:50.229> don't<00:01:50.740> know<00:01:50.799> what<00:01:50.859> you<00:01:50.950> can<00:01:51.070> do

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
Jerusalem I don't know what you can do

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.060 
Jerusalem I don't know what you can do
with<00:01:51.280> that<00:01:51.310> piece<00:01:51.520> of<00:01:51.549> information<00:01:53.009> but<00:01:54.009> I

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
with that piece of information but I

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.029 
with that piece of information but I
think<00:01:54.280> it's<00:01:54.369> interesting<00:01:55.289> now<00:01:56.289> you<00:01:56.920> can

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
think it's interesting now you can

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:58.440 
think it's interesting now you can
follow<00:01:57.250> this<00:01:57.429> without<00:01:57.640> knowing<00:01:57.939> he<00:01:58.030> broadly

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
follow this without knowing he broadly

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.690 
follow this without knowing he broadly
but<00:01:58.570> you<00:01:58.869> see<00:01:59.049> it<00:01:59.109> now<00:01:59.439> why<00:01:59.619> 49<00:02:00.100> was<00:02:00.340> the<00:02:00.429> square

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
but you see it now why 49 was the square

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.760 
but you see it now why 49 was the square
of<00:02:00.789> seven<00:02:01.149> okay<00:02:01.420> that's<00:02:01.630> fine<00:02:01.840> that's<00:02:02.049> not<00:02:02.619> too

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
of seven okay that's fine that's not too

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.249 
of seven okay that's fine that's not too
surprising<00:02:03.240> but<00:02:04.240> just<00:02:04.450> a<00:02:04.509> coincidence<00:02:04.689> of

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
surprising but just a coincidence of

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.819 
surprising but just a coincidence of
course<00:02:05.500> or<00:02:06.100> is<00:02:07.030> it<00:02:07.060> now<00:02:08.049> you<00:02:08.109> could<00:02:08.259> argue<00:02:08.289> well

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:08.829 
course or is it now you could argue well

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:10.529 
course or is it now you could argue well
that's<00:02:09.009> just<00:02:09.100> an<00:02:09.340> accident<00:02:09.789> of<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.119> frequency

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
that's just an accident of the frequency

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.630 
that's just an accident of the frequency
of<00:02:10.570> letters<00:02:10.869> and<00:02:10.899> so<00:02:11.170> forth<00:02:11.440> it's<00:02:12.220> kind<00:02:12.579> of

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
of letters and so forth it's kind of

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.090 
of letters and so forth it's kind of
rare<00:02:12.820> but<00:02:13.120> interesting<00:02:13.650> except<00:02:14.650> what<00:02:14.769> happens

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
rare but interesting except what happens

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.910 
rare but interesting except what happens
is<00:02:15.250> when<00:02:15.370> you<00:02:15.430> go<00:02:15.519> to<00:02:15.579> the<00:02:15.670> book<00:02:15.790> of<00:02:15.880> Exodus<00:02:16.920> go

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
is when you go to the book of Exodus go

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.060 
is when you go to the book of Exodus go
first<00:02:18.190> I'll<00:02:18.720> count<00:02:19.720> 49<00:02:20.260> letters<00:02:20.620> you<00:02:20.920> get

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
first I'll count 49 letters you get

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.780 
first I'll count 49 letters you get
above<00:02:21.510> forty<00:02:22.510> nine<00:02:22.660> letters<00:02:22.959> you<00:02:23.079> get<00:02:23.200> a<00:02:23.260> rash

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
above forty nine letters you get a rash

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.509 
above forty nine letters you get a rash
49<00:02:24.790> letters<00:02:25.090> and<00:02:25.299> you<00:02:25.390> get<00:02:25.480> a<00:02:25.510> hey<00:02:26.250> same<00:02:27.250> thing

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
49 letters and you get a hey same thing

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.800 
49 letters and you get a hey same thing
happens<00:02:28.650> what's<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.769> probability<00:02:30.010> of<00:02:30.400> that

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
happens what's the probability of that

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.199 
happens what's the probability of that
whatever<00:02:31.810> the<00:02:31.900> first<00:02:32.170> probability<00:02:32.799> is<00:02:33.209> it's

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
whatever the first probability is it's

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.990 
whatever the first probability is it's
that<00:02:34.510> squared<00:02:35.730> okay<00:02:36.730> so<00:02:37.540> it's<00:02:37.690> very<00:02:38.139> unlikely

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
that squared okay so it's very unlikely

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.550 
that squared okay so it's very unlikely
just<00:02:40.000> as<00:02:40.150> Exodus<00:02:40.569> you<00:02:40.660> go<00:02:40.750> to<00:02:40.810> Leviticus<00:02:41.350> and

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
just as Exodus you go to Leviticus and

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.870 
just as Exodus you go to Leviticus and
it<00:02:41.650> doesn't<00:02:42.010> happen<00:02:42.190> and<00:02:42.489> when<00:02:42.579> it<00:02:42.609> doesn't

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
it doesn't happen and when it doesn't

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.780 
it doesn't happen and when it doesn't
use<00:02:43.090> almost<00:02:43.299> feel<00:02:43.480> a<00:02:43.510> sigh<00:02:43.750> of<00:02:43.780> relief<00:02:44.109> huh<00:02:44.790> but
