00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:06.759
 let's prepare salads or soft the 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.860
 ingredients we need are 500 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:11.080
 grams of fresh green beans 2 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:14.110
 small tomatoes two small potatoes 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:18.480
 anchovies black olives capers 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:20.980
 olive oil vinegar and salt 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.130
 we start cooking the potatoes 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.829
 super fast way we puncture them with a 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.800
 knife a little and we wrap them in 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:30.720
 phil transparent 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.320
 we roll them up like they were a 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.320
 candy 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:39.100
 and we're going to put the microwave 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.070
 maximum power three minutes will remain 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.410
 cooked and perfect meanwhile in 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:48.840
 a saucepan we prepare water with a little 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.840
 of salt and we are going to cook the green beans 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.680
 we take the potatoes out of the microwave and 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:56.430
 while we know the beans while 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.430
 The water boils 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.840
 we check that the potato is well 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.400
 cooked and will put a little bit in 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.940
 the refrigerator to cool 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:13.030
 quick the green beans take between 10 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.030
 and 15 minutes to be at your point 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:20.149
 Once they are tender we prepare a 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.220
 strainer and we re-wet them well with water 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:25.100
 cool to cool them and cut the 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.800
 cooking so they will keep the green alive that 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.150
 they have 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.150
 we let them drain well 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.680
 and while we are going to peel the potatoes 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.830
 being cooked with this system will 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.410
 the skin goes very well 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.250
 in a fountain we are going to throw our 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.250
 green beans 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.630
 and we chop the potato that you see has 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:55.060
 perfect 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.060
 we also cut the tomatitos 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:03.710
 we toss the olives the capers 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:07.070
 taste of each and cut anchovies 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:10.250
 in pieces the line with oil of 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:13.670
 olive vinegar and salt and ready we have 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:17.540
