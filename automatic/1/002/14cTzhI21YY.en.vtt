00:00:12.142 --> 00:00:14.963
[Four weeks ago] And then there's a more powerful one...

00:00:16.319 --> 00:00:23.296
The Audi TTS. More on that soon!

00:00:24.305 --> 00:00:31.331
So here we are. With the new Audi TTS, the 310 PS sports coupe.

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:34.535
It accelerates quick enough to scare a Porsche Cayman.

00:00:34.535 --> 00:00:44.460
Speaking of which, it will cost a lot - if not around the same - too.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.037
Since we're at a Spanish race track: is it as good to drive, too?

00:01:02.217 --> 00:01:07.503
How is it on the track? Two things are instantly noticeable.

00:01:07.503 --> 00:01:12.882
Contrary to most S models, this TTS enables a lot of oversteer.

00:01:13.401 --> 00:01:19.463
And these Hankook tyres aren't really fit for this car in the wet.

00:01:19.801 --> 00:01:26.397
And the weather is mostly fine at Ascari, but not today.

00:01:26.397 --> 00:01:34.664
However, you can really get a feel for this car and its boundaries.

00:01:35.383 --> 00:01:48.367
The rear steps out quite quickly, even by stepping on the power.

00:01:48.893 --> 00:01:58.287
We're not used to that with Audi's S models, which mostly understeer.

00:01:58.287 --> 00:02:03.800
It's more playful, which is quite exciting.

00:02:04.965 --> 00:02:15.861
There is 2-stage ESP, meaning a safe Sports mode or everything switched of.

00:02:15.861 --> 00:02:24.576
The brakes are good too, even after a while. There's very little fading.

00:02:24.788 --> 00:02:32.334
Sure: it's wet, so the speed is lower, but they still work fine.

00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:43.276
However, the steering still feels direct yet a bit artificial, sadly.

00:02:44.015 --> 00:02:51.624
Is it dynamic enough for a track? It doesn't beat a Cayman, but it's fun.

00:03:11.424 --> 00:03:21.078
This basically has the same 2.0 TFSI as the Audi S3, though with 310 PS.

00:03:21.078 --> 00:03:27.967
Along with 380 Nm, that's plenty. So this TTS is really quick.

00:03:27.967 --> 00:03:34.876
And in true TFSI fashion, the power comes in all at once, always.

00:03:35.447 --> 00:03:40.758
It will keep on going from 2500 rpm, all the way until the rev limit.

00:03:40.758 --> 00:03:52.001
Contrary to older TFSI engines, this keeps on going.

00:03:52.001 --> 00:03:59.170
At the limit, you shift using a paddle of the rapid S-Tronic DCT. 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:16.870
So performance is great, although you miss a bit of violence.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.274
It's a bit too sweet, which is a bit of a shame.

00:04:28.873 --> 00:04:35.964
Is it as good as a Porsche Cayman? We're not sure.

00:04:35.964 --> 00:04:38.389
Though this may be because of the weather and the tyres.

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:45.609
It's the most dynamic TTS ever, so Audi is on the pace.

00:04:45.946 --> 00:04:52.519
The BMW M235i is more of a rival, though it depends on the price too.

00:04:52.519 --> 00:04:56.640
For the definitive verdict, we'll have to wait until it goes on sale.

00:04:59.704 --> 00:05:02.600
+ Very quick, nicely balanced chassis

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.000
- S-Tronic kills some of the experience, steering feels artificial
