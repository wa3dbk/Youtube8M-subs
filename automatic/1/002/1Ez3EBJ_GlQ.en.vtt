00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
find at a craft store but I just found a

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.510 
find at a craft store but I just found a
Styrofoam<00:03:11.500> cube<00:03:11.800> and<00:03:12.100> then<00:03:12.220> you're<00:03:12.340> going<00:03:12.430> to

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
Styrofoam cube and then you're going to

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.520 
Styrofoam cube and then you're going to
want<00:03:12.670> to<00:03:12.760> pick<00:03:12.880> your<00:03:12.940> Instagram<00:03:13.570> photos<00:03:13.750> I'm

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
want to pick your Instagram photos I'm

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.320 
want to pick your Instagram photos I'm
just<00:03:14.830> picking<00:03:15.010> photos<00:03:15.400> off<00:03:15.550> my<00:03:15.700> computer<00:03:15.880> and

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
just picking photos off my computer and

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.449 
just picking photos off my computer and
sizing<00:03:16.720> them<00:03:16.840> down<00:03:16.989> to<00:03:17.170> squares<00:03:17.500> but<00:03:18.130> I<00:03:18.190> would

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
sizing them down to squares but I would

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.310 
sizing them down to squares but I would
recommend<00:03:18.910> making<00:03:19.120> them<00:03:19.420> black<00:03:19.690> and<00:03:19.870> white<00:03:20.050> so

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
recommend making them black and white so

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.500 
recommend making them black and white so
they<00:03:20.470> kind<00:03:20.680> of<00:03:20.770> match<00:03:21.010> together<00:03:21.640> and<00:03:21.970> just

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
they kind of match together and just

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.210 
they kind of match together and just
print<00:03:22.780> them<00:03:22.900> out<00:03:23.020> I<00:03:23.290> didn't<00:03:23.680> even<00:03:23.770> use<00:03:23.860> photo

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
print them out I didn't even use photo

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.670 
print them out I didn't even use photo
paper<00:03:24.520> it<00:03:24.760> just<00:03:24.790> use<00:03:25.060> regular<00:03:25.480> paper<00:03:25.510> and<00:03:26.110> then

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
paper it just use regular paper and then

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.100 
paper it just use regular paper and then
I'm<00:03:26.800> going<00:03:26.950> to<00:03:27.010> trace<00:03:27.310> my<00:03:27.850> cube<00:03:28.300> around<00:03:28.510> each

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
I'm going to trace my cube around each

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.500 
I'm going to trace my cube around each
photo<00:03:29.440> I<00:03:29.770> would<00:03:30.220> recommend<00:03:30.670> just<00:03:30.850> doing<00:03:30.970> about

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
photo I would recommend just doing about

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.960 
photo I would recommend just doing about
half<00:03:31.570> a<00:03:31.930> page<00:03:32.140> for<00:03:32.410> each<00:03:32.530> photo<00:03:32.830> and<00:03:33.250> then

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
half a page for each photo and then

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.670 
half a page for each photo and then
we're<00:03:34.120> obviously<00:03:34.300> just<00:03:34.930> going<00:03:35.170> to<00:03:35.320> cut<00:03:35.500> our

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
we're obviously just going to cut our

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.440 
we're obviously just going to cut our
pictures<00:03:36.010> out<00:03:36.220> and<00:03:36.459> make<00:03:36.640> sure<00:03:36.820> they<00:03:37.030> fit<00:03:37.270> the

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
pictures out and make sure they fit the

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:43.270 
pictures out and make sure they fit the
shape<00:03:37.690> of<00:03:37.720> our<00:03:38.020> square

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.949 

so<00:03:44.280> then<00:03:44.760> we're<00:03:44.940> just<00:03:44.970> going<00:03:45.239> to<00:03:45.270> be<00:03:45.420> Mod<00:03:45.660> Podge

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
so then we're just going to be Mod Podge

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.800 
so then we're just going to be Mod Podge
