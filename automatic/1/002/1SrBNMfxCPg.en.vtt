from<00:00:09.099> a<00:00:09.190> very<00:00:09.400> first<00:00:09.639> day<00:00:09.879> opening<00:00:10.480> up<00:00:10.629> we

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:10.839 
from a very first day opening up we

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:12.749 
from a very first day opening up we
decided<00:00:11.379> to<00:00:11.619> completely<00:00:12.039> transform<00:00:12.369> the

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:12.759 
decided to completely transform the

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:14.129 
decided to completely transform the
teaching<00:00:12.879> and<00:00:13.150> learning<00:00:13.209> experience

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:14.139 
teaching and learning experience

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:16.800 
teaching and learning experience
in<00:00:14.349> the<00:00:14.559> school<00:00:14.859> so<00:00:15.730> we<00:00:16.000> looked<00:00:16.209> at<00:00:16.360> a<00:00:16.419> number

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:16.810 
in the school so we looked at a number

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.420 
in the school so we looked at a number
of<00:00:17.110> different<00:00:17.500> options<00:00:17.860> and<00:00:18.009> one<00:00:18.160> of<00:00:18.279> the

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:18.430 
of different options and one of the

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.920 
of different options and one of the
options<00:00:18.789> that<00:00:18.849> kind<00:00:19.480> of<00:00:19.570> come<00:00:19.720> to<00:00:19.900> the

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:19.930 
options that kind of come to the

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.319 
options that kind of come to the
forefront<00:00:20.020> for<00:00:20.590> us<00:00:20.739> was<00:00:20.949> the<00:00:21.310> surface<00:00:21.820> device

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:22.329 
forefront for us was the surface device

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:25.200 
forefront for us was the surface device
which<00:00:22.930> is<00:00:23.169> a<00:00:23.199> really<00:00:23.680> effective<00:00:24.040> tool<00:00:24.669> because

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
which is a really effective tool because

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.109 
which is a really effective tool because
of<00:00:25.239> its<00:00:25.509> capabilities<00:00:26.259> to<00:00:26.829> meet<00:00:26.980> air<00:00:27.309> needs<00:00:27.610> as

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
of its capabilities to meet air needs as

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:29.720 
of its capabilities to meet air needs as
teachers<00:00:28.689> and<00:00:28.840> to<00:00:28.960> meet<00:00:29.110> the<00:00:29.259> students<00:00:29.649> needs

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
teachers and to meet the students needs

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.110 
teachers and to meet the students needs
we<00:00:30.730> first<00:00:31.000> made<00:00:31.210> the<00:00:31.239> switch<00:00:31.629> in<00:00:31.980> 2011<00:00:32.980> as<00:00:33.219> part

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
we first made the switch in 2011 as part

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.819 
we first made the switch in 2011 as part
of<00:00:34.390> the<00:00:34.480> whole<00:00:34.719> school<00:00:35.020> approach<00:00:35.140> we<00:00:35.620> moved

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:35.829 
of the whole school approach we moved

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:38.490 
of the whole school approach we moved
towards<00:00:36.250> introducing<00:00:36.879> ebooks<00:00:37.420> and<00:00:37.750> textbooks

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
towards introducing ebooks and textbooks

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.740 
towards introducing ebooks and textbooks
into<00:00:39.190> the<00:00:39.430> classroom<00:00:39.910> and<00:00:40.060> this<00:00:40.540> was<00:00:40.720> a

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
into the classroom and this was a

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.720 
into the classroom and this was a
gradual<00:00:41.170> process<00:00:41.410> it's<00:00:42.040> something<00:00:42.160> that<00:00:42.610> we

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
gradual process it's something that we

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.270 
gradual process it's something that we
did<00:00:42.880> over<00:00:43.120> time<00:00:43.510> and<00:00:43.780> learn<00:00:43.989> from<00:00:44.260> the<00:00:45.130> real

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
did over time and learn from the real

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.580 
did over time and learn from the real
advantage<00:00:45.730> of<00:00:45.880> surfaces<00:00:46.450> -<00:00:46.600> it<00:00:46.780> allows<00:00:47.020> us<00:00:47.380> as

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.590 
advantage of surfaces - it allows us as

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.979 
advantage of surfaces - it allows us as
teachers<00:00:47.860> and<00:00:48.310> students<00:00:49.180> to<00:00:49.450> create<00:00:49.810> our<00:00:49.960> own

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989

explaining and how to do assume that's
the<00:01:17.439> same<00:01:17.829> as<00:01:18.009> the<00:01:18.100> ones<00:01:18.310> that<00:01:18.639> are<00:01:18.759> in<00:01:18.880> your

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
the same as the ones that are in your

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.330 
the same as the ones that are in your
worksheets<00:01:19.569> we<00:01:20.289> use<00:01:20.439> PowerPoint<00:01:21.069> to<00:01:21.310> create

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
worksheets we use PowerPoint to create

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.760 
worksheets we use PowerPoint to create
animations<00:01:22.090> and<00:01:22.689> it's<00:01:22.810> a<00:01:22.929> really<00:01:23.109> easy<00:01:23.439> way<00:01:23.740> to

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
animations and it's a really easy way to

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.099 
animations and it's a really easy way to
create<00:01:24.249> videos<00:01:24.670> and<00:01:25.029> they<00:01:25.090> can<00:01:25.270> put<00:01:25.450> narration

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:26.109 
create videos and they can put narration

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:27.870 
create videos and they can put narration
over<00:01:26.200> them<00:01:26.529> we<00:01:27.159> use<00:01:27.279> PowerPoint<00:01:27.759> to<00:01:27.789> create

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
over them we use PowerPoint to create

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.149 
over them we use PowerPoint to create
games<00:01:28.359> as<00:01:28.840> well<00:01:29.020> so<00:01:29.289> brings<00:01:29.560> in<00:01:29.709> the<00:01:29.799> element

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
games as well so brings in the element

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.940 
games as well so brings in the element
of<00:01:30.279> play<00:01:30.490> we<00:01:31.359> use<00:01:31.539> sway<00:01:31.929> to<00:01:31.990> bring<00:01:32.409> the<00:01:32.529> content

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
of play we use sway to bring the content

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.889 
of play we use sway to bring the content
alive<00:01:33.340> where<00:01:33.670> I<00:01:33.700> encourage<00:01:34.090> them<00:01:34.299> you<00:01:34.479> know<00:01:34.840> to

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
alive where I encourage them you know to

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:36.959 
alive where I encourage them you know to
make<00:01:35.109> these<00:01:35.259> digital<00:01:35.770> magazines<00:01:36.340> and<00:01:36.670> make<00:01:36.819> it

make these digital magazines and make it

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:38.789 
make these digital magazines and make it
interesting<00:01:37.299> for<00:01:37.539> each<00:01:37.779> other<00:01:37.990> to<00:01:38.229> read<00:01:38.469> and

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
interesting for each other to read and

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:40.769 
interesting for each other to read and
it's<00:01:39.099> now<00:01:39.279> that's<00:01:39.549> much<00:01:39.729> more<00:01:39.939> creative<00:01:40.599> way

00:01:40.769 --> 00:01:40.779 
it's now that's much more creative way

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:44.160 
it's now that's much more creative way
of<00:01:40.899> presenting<00:01:41.289> it<00:01:41.649> the<00:01:42.549> pen<00:01:42.849> was<00:01:43.149> a<00:01:43.179> huge

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
of presenting it the pen was a huge

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.949 
of presenting it the pen was a huge
factor<00:01:44.740> in<00:01:44.950> choosing<00:01:45.429> the<00:01:45.819> surface<00:01:46.240> with<00:01:46.810> the

00:01:46.949 --> 00:01:46.959 
factor in choosing the surface with the

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:49.319 
factor in choosing the surface with the
digital<00:01:47.349> pen<00:01:47.560> if<00:01:48.069> students<00:01:48.549> make<00:01:48.759> a<00:01:48.789> mistake

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:49.329 
digital pen if students make a mistake

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:51.809 
digital pen if students make a mistake
they<00:01:49.689> can<00:01:49.899> never<00:01:50.109> raise<00:01:50.439> that<00:01:50.829> error<00:01:51.099> and<00:01:51.399> they

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:51.819 
they can never raise that error and they

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:53.219 
they can never raise that error and they
can<00:01:51.999> have<00:01:52.149> another<00:01:52.389> goal<00:01:52.599> with<00:01:52.749> the<00:01:52.840> problem

music in ways that haven't been possible
before<00:02:23.540> we<00:02:24.409> also<00:02:24.620> got<00:02:24.920> all<00:02:25.069> the<00:02:25.189> added

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
before we also got all the added

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.220 
before we also got all the added
benefits<00:02:26.000> that<00:02:26.180> are<00:02:26.329> proven<00:02:26.840> now<00:02:26.959> with<00:02:27.140> the

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
benefits that are proven now with the

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.020 
benefits that are proven now with the
research<00:02:27.620> that<00:02:27.650> when<00:02:28.489> you<00:02:28.610> have<00:02:28.760> a<00:02:28.790> digital

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
research that when you have a digital

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.929 
research that when you have a digital
stylus<00:02:29.840> that<00:02:30.079> the<00:02:30.680> pen<00:02:30.950> is<00:02:31.129> with<00:02:31.400> the<00:02:31.519> surface

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:31.939 
stylus that the pen is with the surface

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:34.179 
stylus that the pen is with the surface
it<00:02:32.180> now<00:02:32.540> allows<00:02:32.870> for<00:02:33.170> much<00:02:33.379> higher<00:02:33.409> order

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:34.189 
it now allows for much higher order

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:36.520 
it now allows for much higher order
thinking<00:02:34.459> around<00:02:35.060> problem<00:02:35.720> solving<00:02:36.200> and<00:02:36.379> so

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
thinking around problem solving and so

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.520 
thinking around problem solving and so
on<00:02:36.650> for<00:02:37.609> me<00:02:37.760> it's<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:38.629> functionality<00:02:39.379> it

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
on for me it's the functionality it

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.429 
on for me it's the functionality it
offers<00:02:39.980> in<00:02:40.310> terms<00:02:40.340> of<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.269> pen<00:02:41.540> capabilities

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:42.439 
offers in terms of the pen capabilities

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:45.160 
offers in terms of the pen capabilities
and<00:02:43.099> also<00:02:43.579> the<00:02:43.760> keyboard<00:02:43.939> capabilities<00:02:44.930> over

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
and also the keyboard capabilities over

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.440 
and also the keyboard capabilities over
other<00:02:45.859> devices<00:02:46.250> that<00:02:46.640> simply<00:02:47.030> offer<00:02:47.180> you<00:02:47.390> a

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
other devices that simply offer you a

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
love what they've done with the surface

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.059 
love what they've done with the surface
because<00:02:51.980> it's<00:02:52.639> the<00:02:52.970> tablet<00:02:53.510> it's<00:02:53.870> a<00:02:54.019> laptop<00:02:54.650> we
