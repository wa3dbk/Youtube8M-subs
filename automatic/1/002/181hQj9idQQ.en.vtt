they<00:01:19.430> will<00:01:19.609> slide<00:01:20.149> back<00:01:20.420> thru<00:01:20.890> that<00:01:21.890> other

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
they will slide back thru that other

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.670 
they will slide back thru that other
object<00:01:22.689> which<00:01:23.689> makes<00:01:23.899> out<00:01:24.049> a<00:01:24.140> lie<00:01:24.289> to<00:01:24.350> you<00:01:24.500> here

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
object which makes out a lie to you here

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.590 
object which makes out a lie to you here
for<00:01:24.859> me<00:01:24.979> now<00:01:25.219> i'm<00:01:26.180> going<00:01:26.299> to<00:01:26.390> put<00:01:26.600> a<00:01:26.630> plate<00:01:27.409> here

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
for me now i'm going to put a plate here

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.499 
for me now i'm going to put a plate here
using<00:01:29.600> the<00:01:29.659> access<00:01:29.990> tool<00:01:30.939> so<00:01:31.939> i<00:01:32.000> can<00:01:32.180> spin<00:01:32.479> it

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
using the access tool so i can spin it

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.499 
using the access tool so i can spin it
right<00:01:32.840> here<00:01:33.140> and<00:01:33.429> then<00:01:34.429> I'm<00:01:34.549> going<00:01:34.700> to<00:01:34.820> line<00:01:35.479> it

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
right here and then I'm going to line it

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.779 
right here and then I'm going to line it
up<00:01:35.750> to<00:01:35.990> where<00:01:36.409> I<00:01:36.469> want<00:01:36.740> it<00:01:36.859> and<00:01:36.920> then<00:01:37.369> take<00:01:37.579> it

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 
up to where I want it and then take it

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.819 
up to where I want it and then take it
off<00:01:37.909> using<00:01:38.899> are<00:01:39.259> on-axis<00:01:40.840> ok<00:01:41.840> now<00:01:42.649> we're<00:01:42.710> going

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
off using are on-axis ok now we're going

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.880 
off using are on-axis ok now we're going
to<00:01:42.950> want<00:01:43.130> to<00:01:43.189> know<00:01:43.340> collide<00:01:43.729> these<00:01:43.969> as<00:01:44.179> well<00:01:44.890> so

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
to want to know collide these as well so

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.620 
to want to know collide these as well so
they<00:01:46.039> don't<00:01:46.189> hit<00:01:46.520> when<00:01:47.090> it's<00:01:47.270> going<00:01:47.390> in<00:01:47.570> the

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
they don't hit when it's going in the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.819 
they don't hit when it's going in the
middle<00:01:47.899> there<00:01:49.840> and<00:01:50.840> you<00:01:51.140> probably<00:01:51.350> could<00:01:51.649> move

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
middle there and you probably could move

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:56.190 
middle there and you probably could move
it<00:01:51.950> back<00:01:52.159> just<00:01:52.520> a<00:01:52.670> little<00:01:52.700> bit

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.660 

just<00:01:57.200> so<00:01:57.470> it's<00:01:57.800> kind<00:01:58.520> of<00:01:58.580> flushed

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.370 

okay<00:02:02.470> get<00:02:03.470> these<00:02:03.619> doors<00:02:03.799> out<00:02:04.100> of<00:02:04.189> the<00:02:04.280> way<00:02:05.380> and

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
okay get these doors out of the way and

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.770 
okay get these doors out of the way and
as<00:02:06.710> you<00:02:06.830> can<00:02:06.950> see<00:02:06.979> when<00:02:07.369> I<00:02:07.400> spawn<00:02:07.820> the<00:02:08.090> doors<00:02:08.330> it

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
as you can see when I spawn the doors it

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.910 
as you can see when I spawn the doors it
set<00:02:09.500> it<00:02:09.619> at<00:02:09.770> 95.9<00:02:10.759> six<00:02:11.360> so<00:02:11.870> in<00:02:12.140> my<00:02:12.290> expression

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
set it at 95.9 six so in my expression

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.300 
set it at 95.9 six so in my expression
here<00:02:13.160> I<00:02:14.770> have<00:02:15.770> 95.9<00:02:16.580> six<00:02:17.120> already<00:02:17.630> set<00:02:18.310> so

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
here I have 95.9 six already set so

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.800 
here I have 95.9 six already set so

if the target finder is true it will

output zero or else it'll output 95.9
six<00:02:29.569> at<00:02:29.870> all<00:02:30.170> the<00:02:30.319> time<00:02:30.500> all<00:02:30.830> times<00:02:31.450> so<00:02:32.450> it

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
six at all the time all times so it

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.600 
six at all the time all times so it
means<00:02:33.019> when<00:02:33.230> there's<00:02:33.650> no<00:02:33.800> target<00:02:34.190> active

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
means when there's no target active

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.710 
means when there's no target active
it'll<00:02:35.360> be<00:02:35.860> 95.9<00:02:36.860> six<00:02:37.340> which<00:02:37.790> will<00:02:38.030> allow<00:02:38.239> it<00:02:38.569> to

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
it'll be 95.9 six which will allow it to

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.289 
it'll be 95.9 six which will allow it to
close<00:02:39.230> all<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:39.620> way<00:02:39.769> and<00:02:40.549> when<00:02:40.670> it<00:02:40.790> is<00:02:40.850> active

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
close all the way and when it is active

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:43.539 
close all the way and when it is active
it'll<00:02:41.540> be<00:02:41.630> zero<00:02:42.010> now<00:02:43.010> I'm<00:02:43.100> going<00:02:43.190> to<00:02:43.280> make<00:02:43.400> my

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
it'll be zero now I'm going to make my

expressions<00:04:25.390> but<00:04:26.390> we're<00:04:26.600> going<00:04:26.690> to<00:04:26.750> do<00:04:26.870> this<00:04:27.020> a

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
expressions but we're going to do this a

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.430 
expressions but we're going to do this a
little<00:04:27.620> bit<00:04:27.800> of<00:04:27.890> a<00:04:27.950> different<00:04:28.250> way<00:04:28.340> here<00:04:29.440> we're

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
little bit of a different way here we're

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.860 
little bit of a different way here we're
going<00:04:30.590> to<00:04:30.680> do<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:32.650> multiply<00:04:33.650> and<00:04:34.690> then<00:04:35.690> we're

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
going to do the multiply and then we're

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.950 
going to do the multiply and then we're
going<00:04:36.020> to<00:04:36.140> need<00:04:36.290> the<00:04:36.610> subtraction<00:04:37.630> and<00:04:38.630> now

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
going to need the subtraction and now

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.860 
going to need the subtraction and now
let's<00:04:39.380> go<00:04:39.620> to<00:04:42.040> constant<00:04:43.040> value<00:04:43.340> and<00:04:43.870> makes

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
let's go to constant value and makes

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.320 
let's go to constant value and makes
your<00:04:44.990> number<00:04:45.290> of<00:04:45.410> values<00:04:45.740> is<00:04:45.770> one<00:04:46.130> and<00:04:46.460> value<00:04:47.090> 1

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
your number of values is one and value 1

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:52.840 
your number of values is one and value 1
equals<00:04:47.870> 90<00:04:48.610> 5.96<00:04:51.040> you<00:04:52.040> got<00:04:52.220> type<00:04:52.430> it<00:04:52.550> in<00:04:52.669> right

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
equals 90 5.96 you got type it in right

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:58.960 
equals 90 5.96 you got type it in right
okay<00:04:54.610> now<00:04:55.990> what<00:04:56.990> I<00:04:57.080> want<00:04:57.260> to<00:04:57.320> do<00:04:57.470> is<00:04:57.680> I<00:04:58.010> want<00:04:58.730> to

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
okay now what I want to do is I want to

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.150 
okay now what I want to do is I want to
multiply<00:04:59.740> the<00:05:00.740> target<00:05:01.130> finder<00:05:01.930> by<00:05:02.930> the

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
multiply the target finder by the

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.340 
multiply the target finder by the
constant<00:05:04.160> value<00:05:04.460> so<00:05:05.180> when<00:05:05.390> the<00:05:05.930> target<00:05:06.140> is

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
constant value so when the target is

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.540 
constant value so when the target is
active<00:05:06.800> and<00:05:07.430> i'll<00:05:07.730> put<00:05:07.910> 95.9<00:05:08.690> six<00:05:09.460> for<00:05:10.460> the

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
active and i'll put 95.9 six for the

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.550 
active and i'll put 95.9 six for the
length<00:05:10.730> and<00:05:14.200> it's<00:05:15.200> going<00:05:15.290> to<00:05:15.380> be<00:05:15.440> a<00:05:15.470> little

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
length and it's going to be a little

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.860 
length and it's going to be a little
bass<00:05:15.830> ackwards<00:05:16.130> here<00:05:16.550> now<00:05:17.390> the<00:05:17.450> now<00:05:17.630> you<00:05:17.690> want

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
bass ackwards here now the now you want

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.480

this<00:05:27.460> multiplied<00:05:28.460> equals<00:05:29.270> the<00:05:29.960> length<00:05:30.140> of<00:05:30.380> the

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
this multiplied equals the length of the

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.690 
this multiplied equals the length of the
door<00:05:30.740> and<00:05:31.070> it'll<00:05:31.700> take<00:05:31.880> that<00:05:32.030> away<00:05:32.150> from<00:05:32.410> the

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
door and it'll take that away from the

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.060 
door and it'll take that away from the
length<00:05:34.700> that<00:05:34.940> is<00:05:35.000> supposed<00:05:35.390> to<00:05:35.480> be<00:05:35.770> which<00:05:36.770> in

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
length that is supposed to be which in

length that is supposed to be which in
this<00:05:37.220> case<00:05:37.280> is<00:05:37.490> supposed<00:05:37.790> to<00:05:37.850> be<00:05:37.910> 95.9<00:05:38.810> six<00:05:39.310> so

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
this case is supposed to be 95.9 six so

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.190 
this case is supposed to be 95.9 six so
we<00:05:40.460> connect<00:05:41.030> the<00:05:41.090> length<00:05:41.390> to<00:05:41.720> the<00:05:41.750> subtract

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.200 
we connect the length to the subtract

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.980 
we connect the length to the subtract

and<00:05:47.950> I<00:05:48.670> just<00:05:49.150> remember<00:05:49.300> where<00:05:49.660> they<00:05:49.750> are<00:05:49.900> so

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:50.290 
and I just remember where they are so

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:56.790 
and I just remember where they are so
slim<00:05:51.220> easy<00:05:52.530> so<00:05:53.530> now<00:05:55.080> when<00:05:56.080> i<00:05:56.140> unfreeze<00:05:56.620> the

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
slim easy so now when i unfreeze the

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.480 
slim easy so now when i unfreeze the
doors<00:05:57.010> like<00:05:57.190> that<00:05:57.430> as<00:05:57.930> you<00:05:58.930> can<00:05:59.050> see<00:05:59.320> the<00:06:00.250> doors

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 
doors like that as you can see the doors

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.670 
doors like that as you can see the doors
will<00:06:00.700> do<00:06:00.850> the<00:06:00.940> same<00:06:01.180> exact<00:06:01.660> thing<00:06:02.050> as<00:06:02.080> they<00:06:02.530> did

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
will do the same exact thing as they did

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:08.880 
will do the same exact thing as they did
before<00:06:03.780> there<00:06:04.780> you<00:06:04.870> go<00:06:05.080> enjoy<00:06:06.180> good<00:06:07.180> times<00:06:07.890> now

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:08.890 
before there you go enjoy good times now

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:13.160 
before there you go enjoy good times now
i<00:06:08.950> will<00:06:09.460> just<00:06:09.580> clean<00:06:09.910> it<00:06:09.940> up<00:06:11.580> there<00:06:12.580> you<00:06:12.670> go

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:13.170 
i will just clean it up there you go

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:18.180 
i will just clean it up there you go
perfect<00:06:15.810> ok<00:06:16.810> here<00:06:17.050> i<00:06:17.080> am<00:06:17.170> again<00:06:17.200> i<00:06:17.530> was<00:06:17.950> told

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.190 
perfect ok here i am again i was told

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:19.950 
perfect ok here i am again i was told
that<00:06:18.370> some<00:06:19.090> people<00:06:19.330> might<00:06:19.450> not<00:06:19.630> want<00:06:19.840> the

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 
that some people might not want the

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.540 
that some people might not want the
doors<00:06:20.170> to<00:06:20.200> open<00:06:20.320> up<00:06:20.680> all<00:06:20.890> the<00:06:21.040> way<00:06:21.160> like<00:06:21.370> they

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:21.550 
doors to open up all the way like they

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.140 
doors to open up all the way like they
are<00:06:21.670> right<00:06:21.700> now<00:06:22.080> so<00:06:23.080> in<00:06:23.590> this<00:06:23.710> case<00:06:23.980> we<00:06:24.880> will<00:06:24.940> go

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.150 
are right now so in this case we will go

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.600 
are right now so in this case we will go
to<00:06:25.210> constant<00:06:25.840> value<00:06:26.190> to<00:06:27.190> the<00:06:27.310> number<00:06:27.550> of

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.610 
to constant value to the number of

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:31.350 
to constant value to the number of
values<00:06:27.850> 22<00:06:28.180> value<00:06:29.140> will<00:06:29.590> be<00:06:29.880> 52<00:06:30.880> open<00:06:31.150> it<00:06:31.240> up

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 
values 22 value will be 52 open it up

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.720 
values 22 value will be 52 open it up
halfway<00:06:31.540> as<00:06:32.340> for<00:06:33.340> that<00:06:33.460> and<00:06:34.300> change<00:06:34.540> multiply

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:35.730 
halfway as for that and change multiply

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:39.870 
halfway as for that and change multiply
from<00:06:36.730> the<00:06:37.570> value<00:06:38.020> has<00:06:38.320> to<00:06:38.560> be<00:06:38.650> changed<00:06:38.860> to<00:06:39.280> 50

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:39.880 
from the value has to be changed to 50

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.920 
from the value has to be changed to 50
then<00:06:40.840> an<00:06:40.990> only<00:06:41.290> open<00:06:41.650> half<00:06:41.830> way<00:06:42.070> which<00:06:42.880> is<00:06:43.240> sort

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:43.930 
then an only open half way which is sort

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.860 
then an only open half way which is sort
of<00:06:43.990> like<00:06:44.080> this

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:46.870 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.130

there you go also links to free kill for

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:53.430 
there you go also links to free kill for
