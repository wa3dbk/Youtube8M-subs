 pancake and pasta on super smash bros 3ds 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.450
 but before showing it I want to say that 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.700
 this crepe and pasta is from a friend of 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.920
 smash asked I mean dark alone 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.350
 arachnid give thanks for leaving 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.240
 upload your story by the way I did 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.850
 some modifications to make it more 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.340
 long sorry if it bothered you that's that 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.470
 I did not want it to be so short xd good 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.800
 with nothing more to say that the 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.800
 video or 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.920
 I am a man who will not say his name 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.160
 fear that Masahiro will find it 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.310
 sakurai everything started a day in which 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.410
 was working on nintendo was 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.290
 testing the super smash bros for 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.750
 nintendo 3ds one of the games that more 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.780
 I was being waited for the console 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.540
 I was a programmer that day I was 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.330
 about to leave work to go to the 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:09.060
 house was the only worker who has not yet 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.700
 I left because I was testing 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.910
 some characters to see if they had not 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.340
 failures with them I was already about to 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.220
 indra in one of the tables there was a 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.470
 3ds console of someone maybe one of 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.690
 the programmers was watching the 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.390
 modes or fulfilling some function 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.090
 similar to mine it made me want to see 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.550
 then I realized that there was a way 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.220
 curious in which I had not worked 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.710
 I was very struck by the way 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.290
 called was more luck I had already 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.990
 worked on brawn and I thought it was a 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.420
 sort of like the emissary 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.560
 subspace without anything else I tried it with 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.140
 robyn one 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.750
 character that we had just done that 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.759
 We were going to confirm this character after 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.659
 a smash direct that we had programmed 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:00.060
 well let's not get off the subject the way 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.520
 It was very entertaining and I knew that you had 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.369
 what to do immediately had defeated 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.619
 many enemies and had empowered me 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.860
 character to the fullest when the time 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.800
 finished the words said in red jr 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.560
 time or death time was a 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.780
 minigame apparently the game consisted 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.569
 in which your character should run with 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.970
 three others and resisted died also he 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.069
 I could hurt by leaving aside the 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.470
 title I thought it would be a way 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.870
 entertaining thing that I regret 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:34.650
 think that that way was very but very 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:37.019
 strange I will give you the features if 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.989
 your character was weakening he did not return to 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:42.680
 appear he would scream extremely 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.360
 strong and its image of the touch screen 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.180
 it would disappear leaving only the color 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.150
 of the background if a character hit you 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.920
 much your clothes and masks or other objects 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.190
 what are you using 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.770
 would happen to break yet I was not made 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.660
 weird since I thought that nintendo just 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.780
 I had done it to have a better 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.090
 experience in the game without leaving the 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.220
 I tried everything possible 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.190
 survive and pitt had killed marc 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:14.160
 only he and fox were left when the 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.890
 I killed fox and only that pit was left 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.519
 although my efforts to win were 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.349
 many I ended up losing when I finished 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.120
 suppose that the 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:27.150
 screen with the winner and those who 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.400
 They lost but it was not that both 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.680
 screens of the consoles were left 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.230
 black for 3 seconds and suddenly 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:38.010
 I got a message that said continue 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.319
 with the option if I did not do something weird 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.840
 since in the only modes that I only saw 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.299
 the option to continue were in the mode 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.580
 classic and others but I thought it was the 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:50.250
 had incorporated to is more ventura and 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.069
 then I gave the option if instead 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.440
 to appear me fox martÃ­ pit they were 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.600
 the fighters of the game just me 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.100
 appeared to pit on a stage with 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.410
 black background us 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.050
 we were all standing on a platform 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.390
 white color is as if the stage 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:09.090
 a nine- year-old child would have 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.850
 without imagination when the battle began 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.250
 I tried to attack dark peet's but 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.620
 as much as I tried to give pit was 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.080
 too much but too fast 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.050
 buttons did not react because that pitt 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:24.630
 I literally did not let myself be attacked or 

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:27.360
 for a second when he took away the last 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.220
 life I thought that now I was going to show the 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.620
 screen of those who lost and the 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.900
 winner but instead dark pete 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.870
 he made one of his taunts and out of nowhere he 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.060
 transformed into master core at that time 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.670
 I began to fear as much 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.920
 it is assumed that master core is only 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:46.620
 transformed when crush was destroyed 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.140
 and no longer master hand and that's not all 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.690
 transformed into a hand as classical or 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.940
 master hand but this hand was not like 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.430
 that of a glove was about the 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.160
 size of the stage and it looked like a hand 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.320
 of a real person but this one had the 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.200
 broken skin with the flesh out of it and 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.760
 with small knives buried in addition 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.790
 the hand had worms 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.230
 parasites the hand I kill myself 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:13.380
 automatically after that I 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:15.690
 the credits appeared I did not understand that 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.970
 I'm supposed to kill myself and the credits 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.730
 they are only supposed to come out when 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.860
 you win but my character was not and in 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.900
 place of appearing the names of the 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.060
 where game developers 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.820
 suppose you have to hit to see 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:32.040
 an image of your character because it came out 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.680
 the image of a dead child sitting 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:37.350
 lying on the floor with a note pasted on 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:40.260
 his head saying tim and he gave me 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:42.780
 very scary since I had never seen 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:45.690
 that in a game of nintendo then 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:48.060
 scared I threw the console to the floor and I took 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:50.400
 a table where some papers were 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.050
 with the game data and I launched it 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.810
 against the console in order to 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:57.210
 destroy it at all costs at that time 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:00.120
 Nintendo guards came in and 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:02.370
 sakura and seeing the disaster that cause you 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.740
 I said that the smash centura mode was 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:07.980
 I told him how awful master core 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:11.580
 masahiro sakurai looked at me and told me and what 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:14.729
 you're going to make me accuse me with the police 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:17.430
 haha nadien will you believe all will think 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:19.590
 you're crazy after that he ordered 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.509
 the guards that will throw me out though 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.879
 I wish I had sued 

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:26.520
 I would know that no one would believe me so 

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:29.009
 I simply decided to resign passed 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.379
 a few days and I decided to see the smash direct 

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:34.650
 that we programmed between all that had 

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:36.930
 revealed goodbye and cheikh samb usero char 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:39.659
 and sardi groninga just as we had 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:42.689
 decided but one thing that struck me 

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:45.479
 was to see the adventure smash was very 

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:47.969
 apparently changed what I played was 

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:50.340
 a beta version of macabre dreams 

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:52.710
 of sakura and from that moment procure 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:55.379
 forget everything and live in peace with me 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:57.840
 family currently work in another 

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:58.560
 company whose name I will not say for 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.409
 fear 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:03.870
 Anyway I've done pretty well but not 

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:06.529
 it's the same but it's better than everything 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:06.529
 what happened to me
