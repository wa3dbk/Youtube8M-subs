this together so let me show you how we

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.730 
this together so let me show you how we
did<00:06:56.270> that<00:06:56.479> on<00:06:56.690> this<00:06:56.900> piece<00:06:57.229> right<00:06:57.500> here

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:57.740 
did that on this piece right here

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.250 
did that on this piece right here
there's<00:06:58.400> a<00:06:58.460> piece<00:06:58.760> of<00:06:59.030> scotch<00:06:59.479> tape<00:06:59.840> that<00:07:00.139> I've

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:00.260 
there's a piece of scotch tape that I've

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.710 
there's a piece of scotch tape that I've
taped<00:07:00.560> where<00:07:00.949> I<00:07:00.979> actually<00:07:01.280> cut<00:07:01.820> into<00:07:02.300> this<00:07:02.419> one

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:02.720 
taped where I actually cut into this one

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.350 
taped where I actually cut into this one
so<00:07:03.470> it's<00:07:03.650> been<00:07:03.830> cut<00:07:04.130> out<00:07:04.159> very<00:07:04.610> carefully<00:07:05.210> all

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.360 
so it's been cut out very carefully all

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.540 
so it's been cut out very carefully all
around<00:07:05.720> and<00:07:06.050> the<00:07:06.500> goal<00:07:06.680> is<00:07:06.830> that<00:07:06.979> you<00:07:07.039> want

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:07.550 
around and the goal is that you want

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:09.070 
around and the goal is that you want
both<00:07:08.030> the<00:07:08.300> positive<00:07:08.840> and<00:07:08.960> the<00:07:08.990> negative

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:09.080 
both the positive and the negative

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.409 
both the positive and the negative
because<00:07:09.889> sometimes<00:07:10.280> you<00:07:10.550> want<00:07:10.580> to<00:07:10.940> just<00:07:11.210> have

00:07:11.409 --> 00:07:11.419 
because sometimes you want to just have

00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:13.540 
because sometimes you want to just have
the<00:07:11.570> people<00:07:11.750> and<00:07:12.139> that<00:07:12.380> would<00:07:12.560> be<00:07:12.770> the

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:13.550 
the people and that would be the

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:15.730 
the people and that would be the
positive<00:07:14.419> so<00:07:14.810> when<00:07:14.960> you're<00:07:15.080> gonna<00:07:15.199> ink<00:07:15.470> it<00:07:15.650> or

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:15.740 
positive so when you're gonna ink it or

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.920 
positive so when you're gonna ink it or
you<00:07:15.860> could<00:07:16.070> spray<00:07:16.520> this<00:07:16.880> you<00:07:17.300> can<00:07:17.449> do<00:07:17.570> lots<00:07:17.780> of

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:17.930 
you could spray this you can do lots of

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:19.480 
you could spray this you can do lots of
different<00:07:18.199> things<00:07:18.349> with<00:07:18.680> the<00:07:18.860> stencil<00:07:19.130> you're

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:19.490 
different things with the stencil you're

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.550 
different things with the stencil you're
going<00:07:19.699> to<00:07:19.760> get<00:07:19.909> just<00:07:20.210> the<00:07:20.300> people<00:07:20.720> maybe<00:07:21.349> the

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:21.560 
going to get just the people maybe the

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.260 
going to get just the people maybe the
next<00:07:21.740> time<00:07:22.039> you<00:07:22.159> do<00:07:22.370> it<00:07:22.550> you<00:07:22.820> want<00:07:23.030> the

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:23.270 
next time you do it you want the

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.330 
next time you do it you want the
negative<00:07:23.840> which<00:07:24.229> is<00:07:24.440> actually<00:07:24.830> when<00:07:24.979> you<00:07:25.099> lay

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:25.340 
negative which is actually when you lay

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.279 
negative which is actually when you lay
this<00:07:25.580> down<00:07:25.639> now<00:07:26.300> you're<00:07:26.479> gonna<00:07:26.630> get<00:07:26.840> the<00:07:27.020> spray

00:07:27.279 --> 00:07:27.289 
this down now you're gonna get the spray

00:07:27.289 --> 00:07:28.510 
this down now you're gonna get the spray
all<00:07:27.409> around<00:07:27.710> it<00:07:27.830> when<00:07:27.949> you<00:07:28.039> lift<00:07:28.250> it<00:07:28.400> up

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:28.520 
all around it when you lift it up

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.250 
all around it when you lift it up
whatever<00:07:28.760> color<00:07:29.090> was<00:07:29.330> underneath<00:07:29.599> typically

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:30.260 
whatever color was underneath typically

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.310 
whatever color was underneath typically
white<00:07:30.500> is<00:07:30.770> going<00:07:31.370> to<00:07:31.550> show<00:07:31.789> through<00:07:32.120> so<00:07:32.900> that's

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:33.320 
white is going to show through so that's

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.010 
white is going to show through so that's
basically<00:07:33.889> how<00:07:34.250> I<00:07:34.280> make<00:07:34.610> stencils<00:07:34.909> and<00:07:35.419> in

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:36.020 
basically how I make stencils and in

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.070 
basically how I make stencils and in
fact<00:07:36.530> I<00:07:37.070> have<00:07:37.550> a<00:07:37.580> huge<00:07:38.060> book<00:07:38.360> of<00:07:38.599> lots<00:07:38.900> of

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:39.080 
fact I have a huge book of lots of

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.589 
fact I have a huge book of lots of
pictures<00:07:39.320> that<00:07:39.710> I've<00:07:39.889> done<00:07:40.240> this<00:07:41.240> way<00:07:41.479> and

00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:41.599 
pictures that I've done this way and

00:07:41.599 --> 00:07:43.140 
pictures that I've done this way and
make<00:07:41.750> my<00:07:41.930> own<00:07:41.960> wouldn't<00:07:42.500> I<00:07:42.560> love<00:07:42.830> it<00:07:42.979> if

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:43.150 
make my own wouldn't I love it if

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:45.219 
make my own wouldn't I love it if
crafters<00:07:44.150> workshop<00:07:44.599> would<00:07:44.750> make<00:07:44.930> some<00:07:45.139> of

00:07:45.219 --> 00:07:45.229 
crafters workshop would make some of

00:07:45.229 --> 00:07:47.080 
crafters workshop would make some of
these<00:07:45.320> stencils<00:07:45.740> for<00:07:46.039> us<00:07:46.190> but<00:07:46.370> you<00:07:46.669> can<00:07:46.849> do<00:07:46.970> it

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:47.090 
these stencils for us but you can do it

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:48.940 
these stencils for us but you can do it
on<00:07:47.210> your<00:07:47.240> own<00:07:47.419> and<00:07:47.930> hopefully<00:07:48.409> that<00:07:48.740> really
