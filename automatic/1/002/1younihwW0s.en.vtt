 techniques I can tell you that this mouse 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.070

 cable guys pretty long and hummer 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:52.360
 is behind the computer 15 st we say that 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:55.030
 the strong point of this mouse is that 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.790
 this mouse pulses everything ie everything is 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.159
 7 illuminates 7 of the name in fact 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.080
 mean color boxes to which one is 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.810
 can light up behind guys there will be a 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.369
 on and off button in which you can a 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.270
 turn off the pulse precisely 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.979
 of the brand 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.739
 now numbers I will show all three 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.750
 even if this guys and silver do 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.000
 they show this close up and silver 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.799
 what is in hand is the black one and here 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.570
 there is also the golden one but I will not stand by 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.170
 let you see everyone because they are all 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.790
 equal 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.750
 my considerations appeal after approx 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.670
 a week and a half of use are 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.530
 positive and negative because I have the mouse 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.720
 used mainly at school with the 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.870
 portable because I didn't feel like 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.850
 use it with the fixed pc for the simple 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.340
 the fact that I'm used to it, I know how to use 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.230
 langer that the youtek venus that I am 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.060
 precisely this guy's big mouse is 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.880
 a piccolin mouse indeed look at the 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.040
 my hand as it rests you see it goes up 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.660
 at the bottom and almost crushes him is one 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.420
 of those live mice in which in my opinion if 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.280
 you have a laptop they carry 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.349
 there is a small mouse with two 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.630
 programmable keys two brands program 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:59.280
 there is a very beautiful aesthetic because yes 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.230
 light up everything makes her slutty figure 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.670
 but to some of the first defects 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.010
 what I was just quoting from you 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.300
 now the mouse is very small almost 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.730
 I think the kids in the field 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.709
 daily mmo play with this mouse 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.050
 indeed it is not recommended for 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.880
 that I would recommend loew tech venus 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.230
