Android it's running so first let's take
a<00:00:59.129> look<00:00:59.430> at<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.760> design<00:01:00.120> it's<00:01:00.449> very<00:01:00.690> small<00:01:01.050> and

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
a look at the design it's very small and

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.020 
a look at the design it's very small and
essentially<00:01:01.710> place<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.160> anywhere<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.730> can

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
essentially place this anywhere you can

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.789 
essentially place this anywhere you can
mount<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.390> some<00:01:03.780> examples<00:01:03.870> might<00:01:04.290> be<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.470> watch

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
mount it some examples might be a watch

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.940 
mount it some examples might be a watch
a<00:01:05.189> pendant<00:01:05.850> mounted<00:01:06.540> on<00:01:06.630> your<00:01:06.659> bike<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.770> sky

a pendant mounted on your bike the sky

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.649 
a pendant mounted on your bike the sky
is<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.130> limit<00:01:08.250> really<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.210> display<00:01:09.630> is

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
is the limit really the display is

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.899 
is the limit really the display is
pretty<00:01:10.110> small<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:11.220> resolution<00:01:11.760> is

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
pretty small and the resolution is

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.310 
pretty small and the resolution is
somewhat<00:01:12.299> poor<00:01:12.600> especially<00:01:13.140> when<00:01:13.260> you

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
somewhat poor especially when you

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.600 
somewhat poor especially when you
compare<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.890> some<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.280> competition

compare it to some of the competition

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.030 
compare it to some of the competition
