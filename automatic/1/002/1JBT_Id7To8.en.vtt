00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:04.740
 ah 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.820
 hello everyone in this video I will teach you 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.830
 how to fully customize your 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.379
 cell phones in an easy and without 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.539
 use many applications in this 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:19.779
 occasion may use four pages 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:21.160
 which I'm going to customize well what 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.789
 first they have to do is enter 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.789
 the indeco 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.800
 and enter where part of icons says 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:38.370
 because I came here because I like that 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.540
 I touch you as very uniform and that's how it looks 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.830
 as more organized and well and good and 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.730
 Now let's choose the one that most 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.489
 like 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.760
 I in this case chose the one that I think 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.760
 very nice 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.840
 and good here bring the previous ones 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:04.590
 the smell chastises all the icons that 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.590
 They come with this patio in total are 40 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.200
 they also bring the wallpaper 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:21.009
 well I the truth says use this pack of 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.009
 icons 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.950
 and that leads us to a part where 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.900
 as it fits you as you would stay with 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.290
 the funds and one chooses the one that most 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.290
 like 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.760
 and now I'm going to choose the icons 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:44.020
 that I like then the stadium goes to 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:48.659
 be is for example in this camera 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.659
 I give to who says use this icon 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:55.689
 and it gives you who says camera 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.759
 there I can change the name and if 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:02.280
 I want but I'll leave it like that and give 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.280
 add garlic and ready 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.080
 if we tell our icons 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.500
 they can change the name if they wish or 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.040
 leave them if this time for example 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:23.690
 I'm going to change the name for gallery 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.690
 or by magnets pitchers 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.860
 i 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.860
 i 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.000
 good and so we have now what I 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.360
 I'm going to do is accommodate the applications 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.340
 as much as I like I put in the part 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.300
 below in which I use the most as in 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:02.810
 the phone the message is the camera and the 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:05.720
 internet browser and then organized 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.030
 the other applications 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.210
 good and so we go back into the 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:15.830
 indeco and now I'm going to change which pay 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:17.530
 alike who says background and I choose the 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.630
 what I like best 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.390
 then you can choose who they want there 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.110
 find a lot in this case I 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.110
 liked this 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.260
 and what must be the first floor 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:34.110
 and where it says to use this fund 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.430
 deane on home screen 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.430
 and ready 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.980
 and there I was defining it with when 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.230
 on screen and so it looks good and now 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.660
 for the rest of the pages I will go to 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.060
 crisis of bridget and I will select 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:58.370
 some of these I'm going to put the one on 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:02.019
 google the music player 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.019
 and flashlight 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.720
 together always two in case one 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:09.940
 emergency and I also put some notes 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.610
 to have at hand to write 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:16.799
 any note that comes to mind or that 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.799
 need and I put it down here 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.199
 and so we create the second page 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.800
 and now for the third page we're going 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.349
 also to widgets visitors and he 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.580
 says images we can select the 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:36.050
 images that we want 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.050
 I always select only one image 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:55.550
 what I do is select the calendar 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:58.580
 It is very simple but it is very functional 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:02.610
 good and that's how we left the pages 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:05.370
 from the blocking page and so we see 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.430
 that the customization that we just 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.430
 do 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:14.229
 good and now let's customize the 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:17.889
 keyboard with this application that is called 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:21.460
 haiti ports then only give follow the 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:24.370
 steps that say there and what I'm going to do 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:27.759
 is to choose this clear more I like in your 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:30.069
 case I will choose this white you 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:32.830
 they can also choose the typeface 

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:34.660
 can choose sound 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.550
 and all that 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.990
 You can also choose a picture of 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.740
 background 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.740
 / forward 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.980
 and the cut 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:50.229
 and it is very nice 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.539
 and hey, he wants to change 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.210
 keyboards 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:09.360
 the theme to the keyboard so they could see how 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:13.850
 it's another way that they have many years 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.850
 and they have all the 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.080
 ah 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.770
 yes
