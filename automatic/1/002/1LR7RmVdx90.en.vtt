00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.610
 Hi there, this is Dmitry Kondrashov and 

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:11.110
 today i will tell you how am i 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.389
 I process my photos 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.370
 private messages and ask.fm to me always 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.200
 many questions come about how am i 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.150
 I do it and the most important thing is asking to remove 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.250
 about this video so let's start 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.350
 immediately want to say that identical 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.300
 photos will not work as I will 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.400
 do it all over again and accordingly 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.230
 maybe in other ways to me 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.650
 the main thing is to show the algorithm of how and 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.060
 what tools do i do it 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.890
 I will show on the photo example 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.350
 from the monroe photo shoot everyone likes 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.180
 for some reason most of all so first I 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.460
 I open the smart object by clicking 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.650
 shift keys and press open 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.079
 smart object then i create a duplicate see 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.760
 from the object to the shadow behind the photo from 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:52.650
 what then later I can remove here 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.650
 it's a bright spot in the background 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.740
 so we create a mask 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.740
 we pass sibilla brush on this spot 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.320
 then I merge the layers and proceed to and 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.450
 carcass first I play the nasolabial fold 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.730
 then curing brush i pass by 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.730
 whole face removing the defects of cats 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.950
 then I open the plastic tool and 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:22.200
 starting to add volume hairstyle i 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.200
 also edit face and body model 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.490
 she is 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.960
 then I create a new layer with a mode 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.620
 overlay soft light and start doing 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.620
 must burn 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.240
 but we have 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.810
 as well as adjust a little hand 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.570
 I then blur around the edges of the frame. 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.820
 to focus the viewers attention 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.060
 in the center of the photo where is our 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.060
 model 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.500
 merge all visible layers into a group and 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.180
 name retouching so as not to interfere and now 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.100
 go to the very de draw you 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.380
 item is color correction 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.720
 I create a new blue-white client card 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.729
 and put it in soft light mode 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.650
 then make another gradient map 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:44.460
 until I get that color 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.740
 wish 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.990
 then I turn into curves and do 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.210
 s-curve contrast as well 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:54.110
 tidy up the colors a little red and 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.110
 should him in the shadows 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.919
 then take the tape card again and 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:04.950
 I put it in the blend mode soft 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:07.850
 light then again adjusting the received 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.850
 cool colors 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.280
 then selectively making color corrections 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.350
 the green color is richer diminishing from 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.370
 him yellow adding blue and 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.370
 so do it twice 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:41.560
 Now I add some more curves 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:43.540
 contrast and raising the black point again 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:50.230
 I blame everything in one group and create a new one 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:52.420
 group volume first I highlight the model 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.510
 to even more you divide it on the dark 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.510
 background 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:10.450
 Now I darken the edges of the photo to 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.900
 again draw the viewer's attention to her 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.900
 Centre 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:22.210
 and dim a little dandelion to 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.210
 make it more visible 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:43.810
 well and small strokes on dimming 

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.810
 too bright elements 

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:06.760
 Well, at the end I go filter circuit 

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.510
 sharpness and add in sharpness in my 

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:14.050
 Photo 

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:15.070
 then I duplicate this layer twice Well 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:17.590
 that's all 

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:20.080
 I showed you the algorithm of my work on 

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:22.740
 any photo of you soon 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.740
 until
