length and my history for a body length

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.560 
length and my history for a body length
to<00:01:38.909> wolf<00:01:39.240> wall<00:01:40.020> kind<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.530> cooked<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:41.729> really

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
to wolf wall kind of cooked I really

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.380 
to wolf wall kind of cooked I really
like<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.840> little<00:01:43.020> collar<00:01:43.229> at<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.530> top<00:01:43.740> and

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
like the little collar at the top and

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.969 
like the little collar at the top and
the<00:01:45.390> unique<00:01:46.200> thing<00:01:46.350> about<00:01:46.380> this<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.649> that<00:01:46.740> the

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
the unique thing about this is that the

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.010 
the unique thing about this is that the
streams<00:01:47.220> are<00:01:47.369> really<00:01:47.549> short<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.630> hope<00:01:48.869> my

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
streams are really short so I hope my

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.380 
streams are really short so I hope my
wrists<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.560> my<00:01:49.710> forearms<00:01:50.280> don't<00:01:50.610> get<00:01:50.790> too

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
wrists and my forearms don't get too

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.389 
wrists and my forearms don't get too
cold<00:01:51.689> but<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.710> guess<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:52.979> wouldn't<00:01:53.100> be<00:01:53.189> wearing

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
cold but I guess I wouldn't be wearing

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.249 
cold but I guess I wouldn't be wearing
this<00:01:53.579> when<00:01:53.759> it's<00:01:53.909> really<00:01:54.060> really<00:01:54.360> cold<00:01:54.540> anyway

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
this when it's really really cold anyway

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.830 
this when it's really really cold anyway
and<00:01:56.250> then<00:01:56.399> I've<00:01:56.549> also<00:01:56.670> dissipated<00:01:57.360> with<00:01:57.540> my

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
and then I've also dissipated with my

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.749 
and then I've also dissipated with my
Kate<00:01:58.799> Spade<00:01:59.090> handbag<00:02:00.259> which<00:02:01.259> i<00:02:01.759> recently
