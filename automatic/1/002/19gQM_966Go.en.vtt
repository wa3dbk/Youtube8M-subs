00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:15.689 
take ask does work but I would save it

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:18.890

until<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:16.110> last<00:03:16.379> part<00:03:17.239> because<00:03:18.239> there<00:03:18.780> are

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
until the last part because there are

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.619 
until the last part because there are
quite<00:03:19.530> a<00:03:19.590> few<00:03:19.680> a<00:03:20.129> little<00:03:20.519> bit<00:03:20.609> further<00:03:20.849> on<00:03:20.909> so

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
quite a few a little bit further on so

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:25.640 
quite a few a little bit further on so
just<00:03:21.659> bear<00:03:21.930> that<00:03:22.019> in<00:03:22.079> mind<00:03:22.140> when<00:03:22.379> using<00:03:24.650> cover

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
just bear that in mind when using cover

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.619 
just bear that in mind when using cover
is<00:03:25.769> all<00:03:25.920> over<00:03:26.069> place<00:03:26.280> so<00:03:26.670> you<00:03:27.239> don't<00:03:27.480> really

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 
is all over place so you don't really

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:30.050 
is all over place so you don't really
have<00:03:27.780> an<00:03:27.930> excuse<00:03:28.260> for<00:03:28.439> not<00:03:28.530> to<00:03:28.909> have<00:03:29.909> been

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
have an excuse for not to have been

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.979 
have an excuse for not to have been
quite<00:03:30.599> short<00:03:31.109> in<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.290> open<00:03:32.870> there<00:03:33.870> are

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
quite short in the open there are

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.869 
quite short in the open there are
various<00:03:34.349> doors<00:03:34.530> to<00:03:34.739> write<00:03:34.980> on<00:03:35.129> the<00:03:35.220> left<00:03:35.489> you

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
various doors to write on the left you

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:37.220 
various doors to write on the left you
can<00:03:36.030> go<00:03:36.180> and<00:03:36.299> investigate<00:03:36.599> these<00:03:36.810> if<00:03:36.959> you<00:03:37.019> want

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
can go and investigate these if you want

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.440 
can go and investigate these if you want
however<00:03:38.220> they<00:03:38.519> are<00:03:38.549> usually<00:03:38.760> just<00:03:39.090> dead<00:03:39.299> ends

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
however they are usually just dead ends

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.920 
however they are usually just dead ends
and<00:03:39.599> from<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.019> opponent<00:03:40.790> this<00:03:41.790> room<00:03:42.060> has<00:03:42.659> got

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
and from the opponent this room has got

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.449 
and from the opponent this room has got
three<00:03:43.139> or<00:03:43.200> four<00:03:43.379> enemies<00:03:43.799> in<00:03:43.950> and<00:03:44.159> if<00:03:44.370> you

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
three or four enemies in and if you

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:45.619 
three or four enemies in and if you
don't<00:03:44.639> clear<00:03:44.790> them<00:03:44.909> out<00:03:44.970> then<00:03:45.180> they<00:03:45.269> will<00:03:45.389> pop

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
don't clear them out then they will pop

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:48.020 
don't clear them out then they will pop
up<00:03:45.659> and<00:03:46.620> shoot<00:03:46.859> you<00:03:46.950> kneel<00:03:47.099> and<00:03:47.250> later<00:03:47.609> on<00:03:47.819> so

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
up and shoot you kneel and later on so

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.059 
up and shoot you kneel and later on so
it's<00:03:48.150> probably<00:03:48.569> best<00:03:48.810> to<00:03:49.019> do<00:03:49.170> that<00:03:49.230> sooner

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
it's probably best to do that sooner

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.050 
it's probably best to do that sooner
rather<00:03:50.189> than<00:03:50.310> later<00:03:52.280> that's<00:03:53.280> pretty<00:03:53.700> much<00:03:53.909> it

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
rather than later that's pretty much it

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.720 
rather than later that's pretty much it
for<00:03:54.359> just<00:03:54.959> here<00:03:55.290> you<00:03:55.950> can<00:03:56.159> go<00:03:56.310> right<00:03:56.489> to<00:03:56.609> the

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
for just here you can go right to the

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:57.890 
for just here you can go right to the
end<00:03:56.790> and<00:03:56.939> turn<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.269> left<00:03:57.420> or<00:03:57.629> you<00:03:57.720> can<00:03:57.810> go

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
end and turn the left or you can go

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.979 
end and turn the left or you can go
through<00:03:57.930> this<00:03:58.260> with<00:03:58.379> a<00:03:58.439> side<00:03:58.739> door<00:03:59.840> to<00:04:00.840> the
