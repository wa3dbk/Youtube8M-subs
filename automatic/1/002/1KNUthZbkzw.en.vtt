that it's going to bring back lots of

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.759 
that it's going to bring back lots of
people<00:02:24.330> I<00:02:24.450> mean<00:02:24.599> millions<00:02:24.959> of<00:02:25.349> people<00:02:25.620> i

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
people I mean millions of people i

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.130 
people I mean millions of people i
believe<00:02:26.310> advanced<00:02:26.610> warfare<00:02:26.970> sold<00:02:27.239> like<00:02:27.390> 17<00:02:27.989> to

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
believe advanced warfare sold like 17 to

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.659 
believe advanced warfare sold like 17 to
19<00:02:28.290> million<00:02:28.709> copies<00:02:28.799> i<00:02:29.189> could<00:02:29.489> be<00:02:29.639> wrong

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:29.669 
19 million copies i could be wrong

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:32.030 
19 million copies i could be wrong
ghosts<00:02:30.419> was<00:02:30.659> even<00:02:30.930> like<00:02:31.319> worse<00:02:31.709> i<00:02:31.829> think<00:02:31.950> is

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
ghosts was even like worse i think is

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.739 
ghosts was even like worse i think is
like<00:02:32.129> 18<00:02:32.489> million<00:02:32.700> copies<00:02:33.060> or<00:02:33.419> something<00:02:33.689> like

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:33.749 
like 18 million copies or something like

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:34.059 
like 18 million copies or something like
that

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
that

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.750 
that
but<00:02:34.400> then<00:02:34.489> black<00:02:34.670> ops<00:02:34.909> 2<00:02:35.120> is<00:02:35.269> 27<00:02:36.260> or<00:02:36.379> 29<00:02:37.159> or<00:02:37.400> it's

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
but then black ops 2 is 27 or 29 or it's

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.429 
but then black ops 2 is 27 or 29 or it's
probably<00:02:37.849> even<00:02:38.060> like<00:02:38.269> a<00:02:38.299> 30<00:02:38.659> million<00:02:38.900> or<00:02:39.170> 40

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:39.439

thousand on on the other three consoles
which<00:04:38.270> is<00:04:38.389> like<00:04:38.539> two<00:04:38.900> million<00:04:39.320> people<00:04:39.500> playing

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:40.039

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:42.279 
which is like two million people playing
all<00:04:40.340> together<00:04:40.820> and<00:04:41.240> that's<00:04:41.419> very<00:04:41.750> good<00:04:42.110> that

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.289 
all together and that's very good that

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:43.870 
all together and that's very good that
would<00:04:42.409> pretty<00:04:42.680> much<00:04:42.770> be<00:04:42.889> the<00:04:43.070> same<00:04:43.190> for<00:04:43.699> like

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
would pretty much be the same for like

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.879 
would pretty much be the same for like

two<00:04:48.080> million<00:04:48.230> people<00:04:48.380> on<00:04:48.590> one<00:04:48.740> console<00:04:49.250> but<00:04:49.520> I

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
two million people on one console but I

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.640
