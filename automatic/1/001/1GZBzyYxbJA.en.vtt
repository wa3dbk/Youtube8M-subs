is well is that we have this bevel along
the<00:02:08.849> face<00:02:09.030> shield<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.420> lot<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:09.929> times<00:02:10.140> for<00:02:10.319> road

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
the face shield a lot of times for road

the face shield a lot of times for road
riding<00:02:10.770> people<00:02:11.220> don't<00:02:11.520> realize<00:02:11.790> that<00:02:11.940> a

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
riding people don't realize that a

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.610 
riding people don't realize that a
helmet<00:02:12.180> set<00:02:12.510> up<00:02:12.629> like<00:02:12.810> this<00:02:12.930> which<00:02:13.230> is<00:02:13.349> more

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
helmet set up like this which is more

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.229 
helmet set up like this which is more
that<00:02:13.739> dirt<00:02:14.010> configuration<00:02:14.730> with<00:02:14.879> the<00:02:14.909> shield

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
that dirt configuration with the shield

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.240 
that dirt configuration with the shield
it's<00:02:15.840> going<00:02:15.989> to<00:02:16.049> flow<00:02:16.230> more<00:02:16.440> air<00:02:16.620> but<00:02:16.860> more<00:02:17.069> air

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
it's going to flow more air but more air

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.070 
it's going to flow more air but more air
means<00:02:17.519> more<00:02:17.819> noise<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.420> a<00:02:18.659> lot<00:02:18.810> of<00:02:18.900> times

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
means more noise and a lot of times

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.509 
means more noise and a lot of times
manufacturers<00:02:19.709> have<00:02:19.860> a<00:02:19.890> harder<00:02:20.159> time<00:02:20.190> with<00:02:20.370> a

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
manufacturers have a harder time with a

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.550 
manufacturers have a harder time with a
seal<00:02:20.819> because<00:02:21.299> the<00:02:21.629> different<00:02:21.930> face<00:02:22.140> shaped

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
seal because the different face shaped

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.020 
seal because the different face shaped
face<00:02:22.830> shield<00:02:23.040> so<00:02:23.400> with<00:02:23.519> speed<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:23.879> strength

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
face shield so with speed and strength

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.759 
face shield so with speed and strength
is<00:02:24.269> done<00:02:24.420> as<00:02:24.510> they've<00:02:24.659> added<00:02:24.930> this<00:02:25.049> bevel<00:02:25.440> so

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
is done as they've added this bevel so

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.800 
is done as they've added this bevel so
you<00:02:25.860> get<00:02:26.010> an<00:02:26.220> optically<00:02:26.879> correct<00:02:27.180> shield<00:02:27.599> as

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
you get an optically correct shield as

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.420 
you get an optically correct shield as
best<00:02:28.049> as<00:02:28.200> you<00:02:28.290> can<00:02:28.500> be<00:02:28.680> again<00:02:29.220> it's<00:02:29.370> a

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
best as you can be again it's a

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.850 
best as you can be again it's a
different<00:02:29.580> kind<00:02:29.790> of<00:02:29.940> shape<00:02:30.409> but<00:02:31.409> now<00:02:31.590> you're

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
different kind of shape but now you're

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.319 
different kind of shape but now you're
going<00:02:32.069> to<00:02:32.159> have<00:02:32.250> this<00:02:32.400> battle's<00:02:32.730> bevel<00:02:33.150> so<00:02:33.239> you

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
going to have this battle's bevel so you

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.199 
going to have this battle's bevel so you
get<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.480> better<00:02:33.659> seal<00:02:34.760> looking<00:02:35.760> down<00:02:35.940> so<00:02:36.090> we're

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
get a better seal looking down so we're

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.460 
get a better seal looking down so we're
on<00:02:36.299> a<00:02:36.360> dirt<00:02:36.569> helmet<00:02:36.900> you<00:02:36.989> have<00:02:37.110> more<00:02:37.349> of<00:02:37.379> an

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
on a dirt helmet you have more of an

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.020 
on a dirt helmet you have more of an
open<00:02:37.769> area<00:02:38.010> now<00:02:38.250> we<00:02:38.310> have<00:02:38.519> an<00:02:38.610> open<00:02:38.760> and

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
open area now we have an open and

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.509 
open area now we have an open and
closable<00:02:39.299> vent<00:02:39.569> and<00:02:39.799> that's<00:02:40.799> operated<00:02:41.400> by<00:02:41.489> a

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
closable vent and that's operated by a

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.640 
closable vent and that's operated by a
switch<00:02:41.879> that's<00:02:42.659> on<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.959> inside<00:02:43.409> of<00:02:43.440> the

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
switch that's on the inside of the

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.380 
switch that's on the inside of the
inside<00:02:44.340> of<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.489> helmet<00:02:44.640> here<00:02:44.909> so<00:02:45.030> you<00:02:45.120> can<00:02:45.239> see

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
inside of the helmet here so you can see

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.150 
inside of the helmet here so you can see
right<00:02:45.629> there<00:02:45.840> there's<00:02:46.019> a<00:02:46.079> switch<00:02:46.379> moving<00:02:47.040> with

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
right there there's a switch moving with

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.680 
right there there's a switch moving with
my<00:02:47.280> hand<00:02:47.519> that<00:02:47.700> vents<00:02:47.970> directly<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.599> the

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
my hand that vents directly to the

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.660 
my hand that vents directly to the
shield<00:02:48.900> directly<00:02:49.319> to<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.560> mouth<00:02:49.769> moving<00:02:50.489> up

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
shield directly to the mouth moving up

shield directly to the mouth moving up
on<00:02:50.819> top<00:02:51.090> I<00:02:51.359> like<00:02:51.870> that<00:02:52.019> they<00:02:52.109> have<00:02:52.230> these<00:02:52.349> big

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
on top I like that they have these big

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.410 
on top I like that they have these big
cutaways<00:02:53.010> it<00:02:53.190> allows<00:02:53.370> for<00:02:53.579> airflow<00:02:54.060> but<00:02:54.299> it

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
cutaways it allows for airflow but it

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.360 
cutaways it allows for airflow but it
also<00:02:54.599> allows<00:02:54.959> easy<00:02:55.260> access<00:02:55.379> to<00:02:55.890> your<00:02:55.920> vents

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
also allows easy access to your vents

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.430 
also allows easy access to your vents
chimney<00:02:57.150> vents<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:57.540> then<00:02:57.900> if<00:02:57.989> we<00:02:58.109> move<00:02:58.230> to<00:02:58.349> the

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
chimney vents and then if we move to the

then<00:05:53.220> the<00:05:53.639> high-speed<00:05:54.240> air<00:05:54.419> creates<00:05:54.810> a<00:05:54.900> bit<00:05:55.050> of

then the high-speed air creates a bit of

then the high-speed air creates a bit of

a vacuum behind that airs helped out
through<00:05:57.210> what<00:05:57.300> we<00:05:57.389> call<00:05:57.419> the<00:05:57.660> venturi<00:05:57.960> effect

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.230 
through what we call the venturi effect
which<00:05:58.710> is<00:05:58.740> the<00:05:58.889> same<00:05:59.280> principle<00:05:59.789> that<00:05:59.820> creates

behind<00:06:04.410> it<00:06:04.650> and<00:06:04.740> you<00:06:04.770> get<00:06:04.919> further<00:06:05.280> air
