00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
expansion and of course you don't want

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.090 
expansion and of course you don't want
the<00:01:22.600> process<00:01:22.840> to<00:01:23.050> see<00:01:23.470> that<00:01:23.680> you<00:01:23.860> are<00:01:23.920> going

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
for a new crash so he's sending out this

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:43.490 
for a new crash so he's sending out this
edit<00:01:36.810> but<00:01:37.810> I'm<00:01:37.960> doing<00:01:38.290> a<00:01:38.380> marine<00:01:38.680> anyway<00:01:39.070> so

second marine died my world isn't safe I

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.670 
second marine died my world isn't safe I
was<00:02:26.519> well<00:02:26.790> but<00:02:27.000> now<00:02:27.989> he's<00:02:28.680> got<00:02:28.920> no<00:02:28.950> gun<00:02:29.340> range

and<00:02:31.680> he<00:02:32.040> knows<00:02:32.220> that<00:02:32.250> I'll<00:02:32.700> do<00:02:32.909> something<00:02:33.260> with

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
and he knows that I'll do something with

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.789 
and he knows that I'll do something with
a<00:02:34.379> drop<00:02:35.150> so<00:02:36.150> he<00:02:36.269> could<00:02:36.660> prepare<00:02:36.989> himself<00:02:37.440> a

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
a drop so he could prepare himself a

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.619 
a drop so he could prepare himself a
little<00:02:38.069> bit<00:02:40.129> he<00:02:41.129> has<00:02:41.220> a<00:02:41.250> second<00:02:41.700> gateway<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:42.420> -

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.050 

when<00:03:38.660> you<00:03:38.810> do<00:03:38.960> the<00:03:39.110> new<00:03:39.410> crush<00:03:39.680> strategy<00:03:40.430> you

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
when you do the new crush strategy you

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.140 
when you do the new crush strategy you
need<00:03:41.210> a<00:03:41.270> lot<00:03:41.630> of<00:03:41.810> gas<00:03:42.110> and<00:03:42.320> you<00:03:43.160> have<00:03:43.310> too<00:03:43.940> much

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
need a lot of gas and you have too much

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.810 
need a lot of gas and you have too much
minerals<00:03:44.630> because<00:03:44.840> you<00:03:45.110> can't<00:03:45.550> confuse<00:03:46.550> them

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
minerals because you can't confuse them

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
scout the new crush and at first you

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.580 
scout the new crush and at first you
have<00:03:59.900> to<00:03:59.960> do<00:04:00.170> a<00:04:01.160> Science<00:04:01.670> Vessel<00:04:02.440> because<00:04:03.440> you

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
have to do a Science Vessel because you

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.400 
have to do a Science Vessel because you

want to have the EMP upgrade because

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.490 
want to have the EMP upgrade because
