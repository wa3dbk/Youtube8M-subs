00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.700
 hi girls and guys how are you 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.620
 welcome to the new video of the wine 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.000
 in today's video I will again 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.320
 get off on things that I've seen in the 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.180
 catwalk I like it a lot as I say 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.470
 always look at the collections of the 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.990
 designers and see what things are 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.850
 feasible on my same day land in 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.440
 today we are going to be inspired by 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.039
 burberry prorsum I think it's one of 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:29.050
 makes it easier or easier if 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.820
 let's say he puts it to us so we can 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.190
 web because always as an accessorist their 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.290
 garments with small touches that we can 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.180
 a little replicate in this case is going to 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.530
 based on this theme in pens I know that 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.290
 the feathers good they have their 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.940
 defenders and their detractors to look at the 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.440
 that I am amused if it is true that 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.330
 calls more attention and we will catch 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.280
 a denim jacket as some images 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.170
 that I have taught you and simply 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.879
 let's add a strip of feathers to no 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.010
 It may be easier in the first place 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.260
 we are going to need of course a 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.850
 Denim jacket or any windbreaker and 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.890
 that you have at home or that you can buy 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.229
 even in a low cost store we are going to 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.930
 also need a strip of feathers 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:06.700
 This one that you see is of pontejos I like 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.100
 especially the colorful feathers 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.480
 dark because they give a feeling that 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.310
 they are better than 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.080
 light colors the first thing is to decide on 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.030
 what exactly will the 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.430
 feathers in my case I can place them or 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.110
 just above that strip that 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.780
 characterizes the hunters will be in 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.150
 the bottom or below the bottom of 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.610
 that hem not if I put it up and 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.680
 you notice that it emphasizes more the waist 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.480
 whereas if I put it in the line of 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.430
 down right to the limit what it does is 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.990
 how to lengthen a little more the jacket and 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.700
 highlight more hips 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.440
 I in my case have decided after 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.750
 see it like this visually put it in the 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.030
 top of that hem because 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.160
 I am more interested in accentuating the area of 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.380
 waist the next step that we're going to 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.560
 give is simply and simply put that 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.600
 Feather ribbon around the windbreaker 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.400
 with the help of some pins this 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.650
 it's just a bit to calculate 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.230
 well how much of strip so much of strip 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.850
 feathers we're going to need and then we 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.470
 facilitate also when we get in 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.240
 the sewing machine the next thing 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.940
 we do is place the feathers under 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.340
 the machine and start sewing and that's how it is 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.929
 you see that these feathers are left 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.610
 I think there are very much debated that there is 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.280
 have to have personality to 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.960
 to the street as some would say no and I 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.630
 I tell you that the other day nothing else to do 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.310
 this day, I went to look for my 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.590
 children at school will in fact be taught a 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.510
 photo by instagram and I have to say 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.760
 that everyone that lives me true 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.830
 confidence told me something today in the income 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.320
 that is a water day I always low and what 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.090
 mona these feathers what mona marta there 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.190
 that monkey has been that there was good 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.350
 do not leave different than if you ever 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.490
 I want people to notice you 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.440
 not so to feel you there as 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.630
 important although I do not like anything 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.580
 of if I tell the truth but good for you 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.650
 so you put some feathers and here is this 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.739
 So simple idea, you know I like it 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.570
 show you ideas that you think you can 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.459
 do because many times I debate myself 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.290
 between doing things like prettier and 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.420
 as more complex than say wow that 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.830
 deployment not as of means and of 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.420
 creativity but I'm saying it if it's 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.100
 that is not my style or my style 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.470
 is to simplify what I'm going to complicate 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.630
 life with quite complicated comes already 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.340
 not if you liked it, you know I 'm going 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.200
 to ask for little fingers up a small 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.970
 ad and it's for those people who 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.400
 you live in Coruña you know that the 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.159
 next March 25 is to say I think it's 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.170
 next Tuesday or next Wednesday 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:23.060
