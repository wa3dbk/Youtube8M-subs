00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.849
 Hi everyone, here we are with a new one 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.099
 video action I played the game with 

00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:11.130
 the waxed because it rained abundantly 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.160
 with flectar pants I used the 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.340
 my svd and as a secondary weapon I had the 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.080
 my turn to revealed of 33 then vi 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.470
 I leave the images that I shot with 2 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.650
 go pro hello 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:28.980
 and here we are with the first phase of the 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.309
 game we are on patrol the purpose 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:36.269
 it was to reach a bridge where they were 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.159
 two tango in defense we were eight 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:40.620
 although we were in 8 against two 

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:43.829
 we had the worst but we'll see it 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.370
 soon as you see I am playing with the 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.129
 my svd of the top was a day 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.569
 very rainy very wet 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.379
 in fact I played with waxed because 

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:57.049
 if not impossible to survive 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.260
 bad weather 

00:00:57.049 --> 00:01:03.959
 here there were already a few moments we see 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.420
 there in front of the bridge that was from 

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:11.490
 passing just there were two enemies 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:15.180
 in defense I was looking for a 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:20.010
 strategic point to set fire to 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:23.310
 cover with my dragon here it is there 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:27.570
 a channel that divides the two parts of the 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.370
 field as I do to expose myself known the 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.590
 enemy sniper who was there in 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.200
 that corner that unfortunately hits me or 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.620
 the worst then a mega fell in the 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.380
 main action we see now another 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:43.500
 action this time in defense here the 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.960
 load my touch I was in defense 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.720
 with two other companions against seven 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.540
 strikers unfortunately not knowing the 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.730
 field chosen one side completely 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.380
 wrong indeed if I had been put by 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.210
 another part would have been successful 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.670
 but now we will see that it was 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.270
 nation a bit like that 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.270
 nothing of that 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.460
 the imposition the echo you see the double 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.440
 shot with my two go pro 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.890
 here they were right now 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.050
 appeared enemy that was aiming spar 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.770
 unfortunately I do n't hit him because I had 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:25.990
 unfortunately tarnished wet optics 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:28.150
 so I saw very little and not badly 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.090
 I managed to hit him 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.870
 even though I went very close to him 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.890
 then I realize in a moment I look at myself 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.980
 On the right side 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.390
 meanwhile I was keeping an enemy on my face 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.980
 I was unable to hit who you are 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:47.290
 the big tree made of makeup 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.810
 I notice that they were arriving at 32 from 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.870
 right side and immediately pull me to 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.260
 gust also in this case I had the 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.260
 worse 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:02.230
 another action again in attack here 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.490
 another part of the field that is very beautiful 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.700
 along the river 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:09.430
 we were practically looking for an area 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.830
 with a bamboo reed behind which one is 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:16.120
 he found a little house and here they were 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:18.850
 new three defenders to be flushed out but it's not 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.989
 it was absolutely simple indeed 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.989
 we'll see soon 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.260
 here we organize how to move 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:58.330
 you can see that on the mistrusts mine 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:00.280
 ghilli home made low cost I have 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.950
 realized there is also a tutorial found 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.530
 in the description the link for the video 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.580
 very simple shabby but functional 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.580
 I assure you 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:19.489
 since we were doing very close 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:29.690
 to the place where the defenders were 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:32.720
 decided to switch to the gun and there 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.910
 in front were about 20 meters yes 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:39.290
 they see the greener area of bamboo 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:41.530
 where precisely the three enemies were from 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.530
 find 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:57.080
 here they start shooting at mine 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:59.240
 brand mate show shoot at 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.250
 bulk and will be honest he was shooting 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.620
 to nothingness because they were super 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.940
 there was no possibility here 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:10.220
 needed at the rpk gold room to be able to do so 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:13.600
 flush out thanks to everyone for the video yes 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.600
 see with the next video bye
