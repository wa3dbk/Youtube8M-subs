00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.790 
guess we'll talk about the packs for a
bit<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.240> was<00:00:30.420> when<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.080> man<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.619> match

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
bit it was when the man and the match

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.830 
bit it was when the man and the match
happy<00:00:32.369> hour<00:00:32.399> was<00:00:32.730> happening<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.270> very<00:00:33.570> first

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
happy hour was happening the very first

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.360 
happy hour was happening the very first
one<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.260> there<00:00:34.380> was<00:00:34.469> loads<00:00:34.710> man<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.250> match
