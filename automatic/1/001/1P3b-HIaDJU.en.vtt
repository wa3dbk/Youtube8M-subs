00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.400 
comes assembled but because you can see
the<00:00:48.399> pieces<00:00:48.790> aren't<00:00:49.000> in<00:00:49.180> thirds<00:00:49.540> and<00:00:49.989> if<00:00:50.200> I<00:00:50.290> was

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
the pieces aren't in thirds and if I was

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.080 
the pieces aren't in thirds and if I was
to<00:00:50.500> take<00:00:50.649> this<00:00:50.800> apart<00:00:51.100> and<00:00:51.309> see<00:00:51.399> if<00:00:51.460> I<00:00:51.550> can<00:00:51.790> yeah

00:00:59.940 --> 00:00:59.950 
it took a three way tab like a little

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.889 
it took a three way tab like a little
ninja<00:01:00.219> star<00:01:00.460> looking<00:01:00.940> thing<00:01:01.180> and<00:01:01.750> you<00:01:01.809> have

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
ninja star looking thing and you have

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:03.209 
ninja star looking thing and you have
pieces<00:01:02.140> that<00:01:02.289> look<00:01:02.410> like<00:01:02.590> this<00:01:02.800> and<00:01:03.129> you

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
pieces that look like this and you

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:05.130 
pieces that look like this and you
basically<00:01:03.309> you<00:01:03.579> just<00:01:03.640> put<00:01:03.850> them<00:01:03.940> together<00:01:04.140> put

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
basically you just put them together put

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.539 
basically you just put them together put
three<00:01:05.439> together<00:01:05.979> to<00:01:06.369> make<00:01:06.579> a<00:01:06.759> corner<00:01:07.270> and

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
three together to make a corner and

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.910 
three together to make a corner and
that's<00:01:09.549> how<00:01:09.700> that<00:01:09.790> works<00:01:09.940> and<00:01:10.330> then<00:01:10.860> this<00:01:11.860> one

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
that's how that works and then this one

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.760 
that's how that works and then this one
here<00:01:12.909> is<00:01:12.940> the<00:01:13.420> edges<00:01:13.869> it's<00:01:14.140> basically<00:01:14.470> two

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
here is the edges it's basically two

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.420 
here is the edges it's basically two
pieces<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:16.299> me<00:01:16.479> see<00:01:16.630> if<00:01:16.690> I<00:01:16.780> could<00:01:16.840> split<00:01:17.140> this

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
pieces that me see if I could split this

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.640 
pieces that me see if I could split this
yeah<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:19.720> look<00:01:19.840> like<00:01:19.960> this<00:01:20.140> on<00:01:20.439> the<00:01:20.500> inside

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
yeah that look like this on the inside

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.070 
yeah that look like this on the inside
and<00:01:21.100> you<00:01:22.030> basically<00:01:22.180> just<00:01:22.450> match<00:01:22.810> up<00:01:22.840> the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
and you basically just match up the

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.340 
and you basically just match up the
little<00:01:23.380> a<00:01:23.970> little<00:01:24.970> studs<00:01:25.390> here<00:01:25.570> into<00:01:26.260> the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
little a little studs here into the

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.429 
little a little studs here into the
little<00:01:26.560> holes<00:01:26.740> and<00:01:27.010> then<00:01:28.260> just<00:01:29.260> push<00:01:29.409> it

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
little holes and then just push it

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:31.920 
little holes and then just push it
together<00:01:29.680> nice<00:01:30.070> and<00:01:30.280> clean<00:01:30.490> oh<00:01:30.729> and<00:01:31.570> there<00:01:31.840> you

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
together nice and clean oh and there you

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.230 
together nice and clean oh and there you
go<00:01:31.990> there's<00:01:32.380> your<00:01:32.470> edge<00:01:32.799> and<00:01:33.100> um<00:01:33.790> so<00:01:34.090> that's

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
go there's your edge and um so that's

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.249 
go there's your edge and um so that's
what<00:01:34.360> the<00:01:34.540> the<00:01:35.470> to<00:01:35.970> enter<00:01:36.970> pieces<00:01:37.869> look<00:01:38.049> like

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
what the the to enter pieces look like

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.260 
what the the to enter pieces look like
and<00:01:38.500> then<00:01:38.560> let<00:01:38.740> me<00:01:38.830> get<00:01:38.979> to<00:01:39.159> the<00:01:39.549> corner<00:01:39.880> and

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
and then let me get to the corner and

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.990 
and then let me get to the corner and
the<00:01:40.570> core<00:01:40.869> here<00:01:41.369> liqueur<00:01:42.369> just<00:01:42.670> looks<00:01:42.820> like<00:01:42.850> a

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
the core here liqueur just looks like a

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.710 
the core here liqueur just looks like a
standard<00:01:43.240> Rubik's<00:01:43.750> core<00:01:45.240> what's<00:01:46.240> really<00:01:46.450> cool

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720

this out um they designed it so that see
like<00:01:53.259> as<00:01:53.380> you<00:01:53.500> can<00:01:53.619> see<00:01:53.710> right<00:01:53.740> there<00:01:54.009> how<00:01:54.670> well

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:54.939 
like as you can see right there how well

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:56.760 
like as you can see right there how well
it's<00:01:55.240> holding<00:01:55.630> into<00:01:55.900> the<00:01:55.990> center<00:01:56.229> piece<00:01:56.380> they

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
it's holding into the center piece they

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.590 
it's holding into the center piece they
designed<00:01:57.100> it<00:01:57.189> where<00:01:57.369> all<00:01:57.880> the<00:01:58.000> pieces<00:01:58.210> should

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
designed it where all the pieces should

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.319 
designed it where all the pieces should
flow<00:01:59.409> really<00:01:59.860> really<00:02:00.070> fast<00:02:00.340> and<00:02:00.670> smooth<00:02:01.060> and

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
flow really really fast and smooth and

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:04.649 
flow really really fast and smooth and
um<00:02:02.640> not<00:02:03.640> pop<00:02:03.939> and<00:02:04.240> check<00:02:04.420> out<00:02:04.570> the

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
um not pop and check out the

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.530 
um not pop and check out the
centerpieces<00:02:05.259> what<00:02:05.439> it<00:02:05.530> looks<00:02:05.710> like<00:02:06.540> looks

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
centerpieces what it looks like looks

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.300 
centerpieces what it looks like looks
really<00:02:08.079> cool<00:02:08.319> there's<00:02:08.739> like<00:02:08.829> it<00:02:08.979> I<00:02:09.009> can't

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
really cool there's like it I can't

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.529 
really cool there's like it I can't
really<00:02:09.519> show<00:02:09.670> you<00:02:09.759> let<00:02:10.000> me<00:02:10.030> see<00:02:10.119> if<00:02:10.239> I<00:02:10.299> can<00:02:10.450> get

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
really show you let me see if I can get

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.110 
really show you let me see if I can get
that<00:02:11.019> shot<00:02:11.379> on<00:02:12.279> the<00:02:12.459> bottom<00:02:12.760> it's<00:02:12.909> kind<00:02:13.090> of

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
that shot on the bottom it's kind of

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.780 
that shot on the bottom it's kind of
like<00:02:13.269> indented<00:02:13.900> in<00:02:14.049> to<00:02:14.349> hold<00:02:14.529> the<00:02:14.590> pieces<00:02:14.799> that

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
like indented in to hold the pieces that

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.119 
like indented in to hold the pieces that
makes<00:02:15.879> any<00:02:16.060> sense<00:02:16.379> center<00:02:17.379> caps<00:02:17.590> right<00:02:17.860> here

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
makes any sense center caps right here

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:19.679 
makes any sense center caps right here
they're<00:02:18.340> really<00:02:18.549> easy<00:02:18.579> to<00:02:18.909> take<00:02:19.090> off<00:02:19.269> you<00:02:19.510> just

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:19.689 
they're really easy to take off you just

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:21.270 
they're really easy to take off you just
dig<00:02:20.140> into<00:02:20.290> one<00:02:20.469> of<00:02:20.530> those<00:02:20.620> little<00:02:20.739> tabs<00:02:21.040> there

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
dig into one of those little tabs there

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.880 
dig into one of those little tabs there
and<00:02:21.459> it<00:02:21.549> pops<00:02:21.730> off<00:02:22.109> cube<00:02:23.109> is<00:02:23.290> adjustable

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
and it pops off cube is adjustable

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.080 
and it pops off cube is adjustable
springs<00:02:24.609> and<00:02:26.250> that's<00:02:27.250> that<00:02:27.519> they<00:02:27.700> also<00:02:27.819> have

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
springs and that's that they also have

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.630 
springs and that's that they also have
like<00:02:28.239> these<00:02:28.390> lifted<00:02:28.870> ridges<00:02:29.620> here<00:02:29.890> on<00:02:30.069> most<00:02:30.549> of

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
like these lifted ridges here on most of

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.390 
like these lifted ridges here on most of
the<00:02:30.730> pieces<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:32.650> cause<00:02:32.859> some<00:02:33.129> friction

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
the pieces to cause some friction

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.460 
the pieces to cause some friction
reduction<00:02:33.790> so<00:02:34.510> that's<00:02:34.689> good<00:02:37.079> yes<00:02:38.079> let<00:02:38.230> me<00:02:38.319> put

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
reduction so that's good yes let me put

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.929 
reduction so that's good yes let me put
this<00:02:38.500> back<00:02:38.590> together<00:02:38.859> and<00:02:39.250> then<00:02:39.519> we<00:02:39.760> will

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:39.939 
this back together and then we will

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:41.940 
this back together and then we will
continue<00:02:40.299> the<00:02:40.420> review<00:02:40.569> all<00:02:41.560> right<00:02:41.709> so<00:02:41.829> this

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
worry about that because if you cube

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.899 
worry about that because if you cube
sharply<00:02:56.049> lubes<00:02:56.290> these<00:02:56.470> with<00:02:56.620> Rubik's<00:02:57.040> Cube

00:02:57.899 --> 00:02:57.909 
sharply lubes these with Rubik's Cube

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:02.159 
sharply lubes these with Rubik's Cube
lube<00:02:58.150> and<00:02:59.040> they<00:03:00.040> come<00:03:00.310> out<00:03:00.519> amazing<00:03:01.329> love<00:03:02.019> the

lube and they come out amazing love the

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:04.949 
lube and they come out amazing love the
way<00:03:02.290> it<00:03:02.379> feels<00:03:02.439> um<00:03:02.889> it's<00:03:03.700> it's<00:03:04.120> really<00:03:04.510> smooth

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
way it feels um it's it's really smooth

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.690 
way it feels um it's it's really smooth
kind<00:03:05.530> of<00:03:05.560> like<00:03:05.709> like<00:03:05.950> I<00:03:06.099> like<00:03:06.280> them<00:03:06.459> say<00:03:06.669> that

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
kind of like like I like them say that

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.069 
kind of like like I like them say that
it<00:03:06.970> feels<00:03:07.090> like<00:03:07.209> is<00:03:07.329> riding<00:03:07.599> on<00:03:07.689> ball<00:03:07.900> bearings

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
it feels like is riding on ball bearings

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.339 
it feels like is riding on ball bearings
but<00:03:08.859> there's<00:03:09.099> enough<00:03:09.840> resistance<00:03:10.840> in<00:03:11.169> there

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
but there's enough resistance in there

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.729 
but there's enough resistance in there
so<00:03:11.560> that<00:03:11.590> it<00:03:11.829> has<00:03:12.040> some<00:03:12.400> control

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
so that it has some control

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.309 
so that it has some control
corner-cutting<00:03:14.739> is<00:03:15.010> insane<00:03:15.459> like<00:03:16.060> it<00:03:16.239> this<00:03:17.169> is

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
corner-cutting is insane like it this is

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.289 
corner-cutting is insane like it this is
I<00:03:17.409> have<00:03:17.620> mine<00:03:17.799> set<00:03:18.189> play<00:03:18.370> tight<00:03:18.639> and<00:03:18.849> look<00:03:19.090> this

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
I have mine set play tight and look this

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.110 
I have mine set play tight and look this
is<00:03:19.480> a<00:03:20.069> like<00:03:21.069> look<00:03:21.280> how<00:03:21.370> much<00:03:21.489> tolerance<00:03:21.790> er<00:03:21.940> is

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
is a like look how much tolerance er is

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.339 
is a like look how much tolerance er is
even<00:03:22.329> when<00:03:22.419> you<00:03:22.510> have<00:03:22.629> it<00:03:22.720> set<00:03:22.750> tight<00:03:23.049> and<00:03:23.260> it

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
even when you have it set tight and it

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.020 
even when you have it set tight and it
still<00:03:23.560> cuts<00:03:23.769> through<00:03:23.979> it<00:03:24.010> and<00:03:24.250> I<00:03:24.699> haven't

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
still cuts through it and I haven't

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.229 
still cuts through it and I haven't
lived<00:03:25.120> this<00:03:25.269> in<00:03:25.479> a<00:03:25.569> long<00:03:25.690> time<00:03:25.750> so<00:03:26.609> if<00:03:27.609> I<00:03:27.760> just

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
lived this in a long time so if I just

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.089 
lived this in a long time so if I just
loot<00:03:28.419> it<00:03:28.569> right<00:03:28.690> now<00:03:28.810> it<00:03:29.049> would<00:03:29.169> actually<00:03:29.349> work

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:30.099 
loot it right now it would actually work

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:31.979 
loot it right now it would actually work
a<00:03:30.280> lot<00:03:30.489> better<00:03:30.639> and<00:03:30.970> then<00:03:31.419> as<00:03:31.599> you<00:03:31.629> can<00:03:31.750> see

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
a lot better and then as you can see

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.050 
a lot better and then as you can see
reverse<00:03:32.889> corner<00:03:33.250> cutting<00:03:33.459> reverse<00:03:33.819> cuanto

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
reverse corner cutting reverse cuanto

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.430
