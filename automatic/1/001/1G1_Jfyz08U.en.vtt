00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:06.960
 hello everyone with you frost and today he 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.670
 just talk a little who watched my 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.660
 last fashion review that came out 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.450
 just yesterday 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.000
 probably remember that at the end I said that 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.730
 came up with something with this mod and did 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.029
 video if I can do it like this 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.750
 I did it all I installed this 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:28.340
 mod on servers and what did i come up with one 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.960
 the man really wanted to play with us 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.300
 I was very, very much asking under many videos 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.980
 but somehow taking a stranger with 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.730
 it seemed to me somehow not in the summer play 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.890
 very good ideas and besides, we already 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.360
 recorded all this i mean we already had 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.450
 everything is recorded by the time he 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.610
 started asking for a bulk wash write and 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:50.039
 so I came up with something with this mod 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.280
 I originally wanted to just play I don't know 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.559
 with friends there with bots 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.750
 four may then think why 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.960
 You would not call those subscribers who 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.660
 watching me and playing together 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.430
 I don't know about the record 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.860
 I will try to try 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.960
 write it all down but most likely me 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.390
 not enough RAM to without 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.830
 lag write me when 23 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.760
 man on the server podlagivaet a little 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.330
 when recording 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.369
 and if ten people go I do not know 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.380
 how will lead maybe everything will be 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.810
 it may also be worse I don’t know 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.460
 I wo n’t be able to insert myself 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.810
 RAM because for now 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.560
 there is no money for it 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.840
 I will insert it later, hopefully it will help 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.760
 so what do you need to do to 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.970
 play with us well for a start you must 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:43.440
 write me a personal message that you 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:46.240
 will participate will play with us 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.840
 I hope you know how to write messages 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.180
 here here here will be here the author 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.120
 the name of the channel here will be an arrow 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.010
 down and there you press it to choose 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.140
 personal message write this in order 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.900
 so I know about how many people with 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.300
 we will play because the places on 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.670
 server is limited now instead of 10 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:10.929
 man but i can expand principle i 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:13.060
 my computer will survive and 20 but I do not know 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.130
 how will you lag principle if i 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.900
 I will record most likely many 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.210
 will lag for example like a guy well 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.080
 I don't know, maybe we just have no record 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:25.990
 play will be seen and that 's not all 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.600
 in order to play on the server with this 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:31.210
 mod you need to install this mod yourself 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.740
 on the client that is to put forge 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:36.040
 which is necessary for the operation of this 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:38.830
 server and put this mod since i 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.670
 I know that not everyone can install mods 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.489
 on minecraft 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.860
 I will leave in the description for this video 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.830
 client with a working mod on which you 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.390
 you can go to our server but be 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.920
 original with nicknames do not be all 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.530
 players, and then you will throw out 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.690
 server is constantly well due to the fact that 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.580
 comes nick another player with the same 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.190
 Nickname will throw out 1 which already was on 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.670
 server and on 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.140
 for 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.650
 well coordinated work we will need to somehow 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.349
 communicate and not via skype of course 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.379

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:09.829
 I already forgot this cattle vein will 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:13.620
 be held on sunday at four o'clock 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:16.109
 somewhere in Moscow time and therefore 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:19.729
 in paradise weaved everyone should have gathered 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.959
 somewhere well without 10 4 then Moscow time 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:24.450
 preferably early to fifteen by 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.550
 here, well, somewhere, and we have a little bit 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.930
 started to equip servers now 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.300
 I'll show you a little what we have already built 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.880
 now there guys twirling lock 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.610
 settles him 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.010
 and so here we are already started something 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:41.340
 build a kid here where it flies say 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.450
 hello everybody hello everyone on this one 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.290
 central locking 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:48.390
 ditch here dug up a little remade 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.450
 the castle because the tower was different to 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:53.220
 it was possible to hide from the defenders 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:56.610
 will then here is the main castle here 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:59.310
 there will of course be guns and anything like that 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:02.640
 this tower and this tower belong to them 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.240
 so just in case for stronger 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.910
 defense 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:09.750
 here are the fortifications that 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:11.610
 placed everywhere it's for hitters 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:15.720
 so that they can hide there shooting 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:17.640
 from the leaders than it does not matter what the cows 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.910
 which we will catch catapults in general 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:23.340
 axiom me hide behind them 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:25.680
 and their base is located here on the mountain in 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:29.970
 Generally we have to do this card is what we 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:32.840
 just started back here attacking 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:37.230
 there will also be implements of clothes 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:39.510
 think up what clothes everyone give out 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.230
 in general, so on, we come up with a rule for 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.120
 spawn 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:45.810
 I think we will make some box 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:48.420
 and survey tunnel because if you 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:51.090
 kill not to run on to fight 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.500
 could only already on the observation tunnel 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.840
 watch the outcome of the battle 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.750
 well, or think of something before 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.990
 think up a rule more 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:03.150
 what to put on it already said in general 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.900
 In principle, all that we are here so far 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:08.389
 built we just started 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.460
 I think by Sunday we will have time something 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:13.130
 so beautiful finish though in principle 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.930
 the main thing is already done so again 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.500
 need to write me a message 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:20.050
 to make it clear how many of you out there playing 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:23.650
 put or download a client with a mod 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:27.770
 download raidcall join the group and 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:30.050
 sunday at 345 or at 350 already be at 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.160
 groups the column doesn't even matter if 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.229
 you don't have a microphone 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.180
 do you even listen to what they say to you 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:40.360
 so as not to randomly reach coverage for me 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:40.360
 shoot now you're banned samurai here 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.289
 everyone will have a regime 

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:47.539
 adventure so you can not do anything 

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:50.570
 breaking no blocks there in general 

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:53.660
 able to dig blocks and just pierce 

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:56.780
 wall in the castle to go all and fill up I 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:58.699
 I think that the main tasks of the attackers 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.860
 will kill the king who will be there 

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:04.099
 single diamond armor or something 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:08.650
 like what we think of so far on this 

00:07:04.099 --> 00:07:08.650
 good luck everyone all bye bye
