00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 and you I have a new video for 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.240
 you and today I'm going to you we do 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.809
 for the first time in my life I think 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.309
 I'm going I'm going to cry this is pants 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.950
 I take a shot 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.610
 and today I'm going to let you 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.640
 see 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.529
 this is quite a cheap way of getting it 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.960
 make shirts because I have these pants 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.830
 namely at thrift store applies to 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.680
 7 euros 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:30.029
 and yes that is quite nice as 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.830
 you are curious 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.369
 well then look further and that up 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.369
 team watching 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.400
 and 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:52.230
 ok what do you need 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:55.530
 first a pair of pants and scissors and one 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.200
 pen stand first in front of the mirror 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.980
 and check your pants at any length you want 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.500
 to make 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.690
 a little bit longer than you think because you have to 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.700
 roll it up later and in any case 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.010
 if you have to go short and go wrong 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.729
 so then you can do nothing about it 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.890
 and that she would be under then we go him 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.600
 I cut it out just a little 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.150
 have worked for more than put dashes 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.470
 because that way it's just safe in the back 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.470
 certainly not too short 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.790
 then I throw the short pipe over the long one 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.860
 pipe because that's how you can tell him exactly 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.010
 deepen straight and then both sides are 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.010
 equal 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.610
 Yes 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.370
 then you put the block on and then you go 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.290
 slowly roll up the bible and then will 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:50.440
 you just put it up to the length you want 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.360
 and then it can still sew that tight 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.650
 I let my mother do it and I wanted to 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.650
 but that is handy 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.210
 and hop it oh there you have he knew 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.770
