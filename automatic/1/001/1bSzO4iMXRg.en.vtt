00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
created a few years ago and I'm gonna

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.690 
created a few years ago and I'm gonna
paste<00:01:04.199> this<00:01:04.530> into<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.820> dribble<00:01:06.450> sized<00:01:06.750> file

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
paste this into a dribble sized file

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.200 
paste this into a dribble sized file
proportioned<00:01:08.700> file<00:01:09.979> now<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.040> can<00:01:11.340> skew<00:01:12.090> it

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
proportioned file now you can skew it

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.469 
proportioned file now you can skew it
and<00:01:12.450> rotate<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.560> walk<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.369> image<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.180> give

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
and rotate it and walk the image to give

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.319 
and rotate it and walk the image to give
it<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.630> sense<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.899> perspective<00:01:16.110> but<00:01:17.210> I'm<00:01:18.210> not

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:18.329 
it a sense of perspective but I'm not

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:20.240 
it a sense of perspective but I'm not
gonna<00:01:18.450> do<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.689> in<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:18.840> case<00:01:19.049> I'm<00:01:19.920> just<00:01:20.009> gonna

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
gonna do it in this case I'm just gonna

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.130 
gonna do it in this case I'm just gonna
blow<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.820> right<00:01:20.880> up<00:01:21.439> and<00:01:23.240> maybe<00:01:24.240> put<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.479> jaunty

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
blow it right up and maybe put a jaunty

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.030 
blow it right up and maybe put a jaunty
angle<00:01:25.259> there<00:01:26.390> nice

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
angle there nice

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.920 
angle there nice
now<00:01:29.040> I'm<00:01:29.460> gonna<00:01:29.610> color<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.030> background<00:01:32.930> give

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
now I'm gonna color the background give

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.149 
now I'm gonna color the background give
it<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.079> slightly<00:01:34.320> different<00:01:34.500> color<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.039> we<00:01:35.130> can

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
it a slightly different color so we can

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.149 
it a slightly different color so we can
pick<00:01:35.399> out<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.670> key<00:01:35.880> line<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.770> merge<00:01:37.770> the

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
pick out the key line and merge the

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.100 
pick out the key line and merge the
layers<00:01:39.770> now<00:01:40.770> we're<00:01:40.950> gonna<00:01:41.039> add<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:42.360> quick

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
layers now we're gonna add a quick

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.980 
layers now we're gonna add a quick
vignette<00:01:44.090> so<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.329> gonna<00:01:45.420> kind<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.750> draw

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
vignette so this is gonna kind of draw

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.719 
vignette so this is gonna kind of draw
your<00:01:46.140> eye<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.710> center<00:01:46.859> of<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.640> image

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
your eye to the center of the image

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:54.020 
your eye to the center of the image
slightly<00:01:50.149> I've<00:01:51.149> got<00:01:51.299> this<00:01:51.390> right<00:01:52.789> and<00:01:53.789> take<00:01:54.000> a

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
slightly I've got this right and take a

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.539 
slightly I've got this right and take a
light<00:01:54.299> gray<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.840> basically<00:01:55.259> create<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:56.070> light

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
light gray and basically create a light

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.950 
light gray and basically create a light
gray<00:01:57.090> edge

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
gray edge

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:05.240 
gray edge
I<00:01:58.829> like<00:01:59.219> great<00:01:59.460> edge<00:01:59.700> to<00:02:00.710> our<00:02:03.530> Cardinal<00:02:04.530> we're

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
I like great edge to our Cardinal we're

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.150 
I like great edge to our Cardinal we're
gonna<00:02:05.340> multiply<00:02:05.670> this<00:02:06.590> and<00:02:07.590> that's<00:02:07.859> going<00:02:08.100> to

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
gonna multiply this and that's going to

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.590 
gonna multiply this and that's going to
distort<00:02:08.490> the<00:02:08.610> colors<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.000> little<00:02:09.150> around<00:02:09.480> the

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
distort the colors a little around the

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.800 
distort the colors a little around the
edge

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
edge

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.390 
edge
we're<00:02:11.810> now<00:02:12.370> gonna<00:02:13.370> add<00:02:13.700> a<00:02:14.380> hotspot<00:02:15.380> at<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.190> top

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
we're now gonna add a hotspot at the top

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.950 
we're now gonna add a hotspot at the top
of<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:16.610> image<00:02:16.880> to<00:02:17.120> make<00:02:17.150> it<00:02:17.270> feel<00:02:17.600> like<00:02:17.750> it's

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
of the image to make it feel like it's

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.920 
of the image to make it feel like it's
just<00:02:18.320> slightly<00:02:18.650> lit<00:02:19.040> from<00:02:19.190> above<00:02:19.340> so<00:02:19.930> again

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
just slightly lit from above so again

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.160 
just slightly lit from above so again
we're<00:02:21.260> going<00:02:21.350> to<00:02:21.440> use<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:21.950> gradient<00:02:22.460> tool<00:02:23.170> but

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
we're going to use the gradient tool but

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.570 
we're going to use the gradient tool but
this<00:02:24.350> time<00:02:24.650> we're<00:02:24.950> gonna<00:02:25.010> have<00:02:25.130> a<00:02:25.280> white

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
this time we're gonna have a white

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.710 
this time we're gonna have a white
gradient<00:02:26.480> in<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:27.590> middle<00:02:27.890> now<00:02:28.160> this<00:02:28.400> layer

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
gradient in the middle now this layer

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.880 
gradient in the middle now this layer
the<00:02:29.720> vignette<00:02:30.020> by<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.170> way<00:02:30.290> we<00:02:30.410> multiplied

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
the vignette by the way we multiplied

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.310 
the vignette by the way we multiplied
over<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.400> image<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:31.940> the<00:02:32.420> the<00:02:32.870> hotspot<00:02:33.230> we're

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
over the image the the the hotspot we're

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.170 
over the image the the the hotspot we're
gonna<00:02:33.470> overlay<00:02:33.890> and<00:02:34.730> that's<00:02:34.880> just<00:02:35.030> going<00:02:35.120> to

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
gonna overlay and that's just going to

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.730 
gonna overlay and that's just going to
make<00:02:35.240> our<00:02:35.480> Reds<00:02:35.780> in<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:35.960> middle<00:02:36.230> a<00:02:36.260> little<00:02:36.470> bit

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
make our Reds in the middle a little bit

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.910 
make our Reds in the middle a little bit
Pinker<00:02:37.280> and<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:38.660> light<00:02:39.380> Gray's<00:02:39.650> are<00:02:39.830> gonna

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
Pinker and the light Gray's are gonna

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.800 
Pinker and the light Gray's are gonna
look<00:02:40.100> white<00:02:40.400> it<00:02:40.910> might<00:02:41.090> be<00:02:41.180> a<00:02:41.240> bit<00:02:41.390> much<00:02:41.540> might

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
look white it might be a bit much might

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.240 
look white it might be a bit much might
want<00:02:41.960> to<00:02:41.990> turn<00:02:42.200> that<00:02:42.380> down<00:02:42.560> to<00:02:42.800> about<00:02:42.830> 70%<00:02:45.250> next

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
want to turn that down to about 70% next

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.620 
want to turn that down to about 70% next
what<00:02:46.820> I'm<00:02:46.880> gonna<00:02:47.000> do<00:02:47.270> is<00:02:48.170> add<00:02:48.590> a<00:02:49.420> color<00:02:50.420> wash

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
what I'm gonna do is add a color wash

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.870 
what I'm gonna do is add a color wash
and<00:02:50.840> this<00:02:50.930> is<00:02:51.020> kind<00:02:51.230> of<00:02:51.260> a<00:02:51.910> 3d<00:02:52.910> cliche<00:02:53.840> away<00:02:54.200> but

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
and this is kind of a 3d cliche away but

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.970 
and this is kind of a 3d cliche away but
what<00:02:55.880> we<00:02:56.000> do<00:02:56.330> is<00:02:56.360> kind<00:02:56.990> of<00:02:57.050> light<00:02:57.350> our<00:02:57.620> image

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
what we do is kind of light our image

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.010 
what we do is kind of light our image
left<00:02:58.940> to<00:02:59.120> right<00:03:00.730> using<00:03:01.780> blue<00:03:02.780> and<00:03:02.930> orange

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
left to right using blue and orange

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.870 
left to right using blue and orange
light<00:03:03.260> so<00:03:03.830> from<00:03:04.010> one<00:03:04.190> direction<00:03:04.610> it's<00:03:04.760> going

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
light so from one direction it's going

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.340 
light so from one direction it's going
to<00:03:04.970> feel<00:03:05.150> like<00:03:05.330> it's<00:03:05.480> lit<00:03:05.660> by<00:03:05.840> a<00:03:05.870> blue<00:03:06.110> light

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
to feel like it's lit by a blue light

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.940 
to feel like it's lit by a blue light
and<00:03:06.470> one<00:03:06.620> by<00:03:06.800> an<00:03:06.950> orange<00:03:07.190> light<00:03:08.920> there<00:03:09.920> are

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
and one by an orange light there are

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.949 
and one by an orange light there are
good<00:03:10.160> reasons<00:03:10.340> for<00:03:10.610> this<00:03:10.730> in<00:03:10.940> 3d<00:03:11.450> but<00:03:11.690> I'm<00:03:11.810> not

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
good reasons for this in 3d but I'm not

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.410 
good reasons for this in 3d but I'm not
gonna<00:03:12.170> bore<00:03:12.530> you<00:03:12.590> with<00:03:12.709> them<00:03:12.950> now<00:03:13.130> but<00:03:14.120> all<00:03:14.300> I'm

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
gonna bore you with them now but all I'm

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.009 
gonna bore you with them now but all I'm
gonna<00:03:14.540> do<00:03:14.750> is<00:03:15.200> have<00:03:15.590> a<00:03:15.800> simple<00:03:16.580> color<00:03:17.540> gradient

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
gonna do is have a simple color gradient

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:21.370 
gonna do is have a simple color gradient
going<00:03:18.200> left<00:03:18.500> from<00:03:18.739> left<00:03:19.190> to<00:03:19.250> right<00:03:19.660> and<00:03:20.660> again

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
going left from left to right and again

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.470 
going left from left to right and again
I'm<00:03:21.830> gonna<00:03:21.980> overlay<00:03:22.489> this<00:03:22.670> and<00:03:23.239> it's<00:03:23.420> just

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
I'm gonna overlay this and it's just

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.210 
I'm gonna overlay this and it's just
going<00:03:23.660> to<00:03:23.720> distort<00:03:24.110> the<00:03:24.200> colors<00:03:24.560> a<00:03:24.590> bit<00:03:24.800> and

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
going to distort the colors a bit and

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.729 
going to distort the colors a bit and
make<00:03:25.400> it<00:03:25.610> again<00:03:26.120> a<00:03:26.150> little<00:03:26.510> bit<00:03:26.780> harder<00:03:27.530> to

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
make it again a little bit harder to

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.640 
make it again a little bit harder to
just<00:03:28.640> pick<00:03:28.910> apart<00:03:29.269> with<00:03:29.420> Photoshop<00:03:30.080> -<00:03:30.290> to

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
just pick apart with Photoshop - to

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.440 
just pick apart with Photoshop - to
steal<00:03:30.950> the<00:03:31.160> image<00:03:31.430> so<00:03:32.090> I'm<00:03:32.180> going<00:03:32.300> to<00:03:32.330> make

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
steal the image so I'm going to make

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:33.280 
steal the image so I'm going to make
this

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
this

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.970 
this
I<00:03:33.970> mean<00:03:34.970> it's<00:03:35.120> 33%<00:03:36.459> visible<00:03:37.459> and<00:03:37.700> the<00:03:38.150> opacity

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
I mean it's 33% visible and the opacity

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.580 
I mean it's 33% visible and the opacity
and<00:03:40.120> that's<00:03:41.120> you<00:03:41.540> know<00:03:41.660> that's<00:03:41.840> sort<00:03:42.080> of<00:03:42.230> mid

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
and that's you know that's sort of mid

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.259 
and that's you know that's sort of mid
our<00:03:42.709> colors<00:03:42.950> look<00:03:43.070> a<00:03:43.130> little<00:03:43.280> bit<00:03:43.459> funky<00:03:43.700> but

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
our colors look a little bit funky but

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.570 
our colors look a little bit funky but
it's<00:03:45.200> better<00:03:45.440> than<00:03:45.880> having<00:03:46.880> them<00:03:47.120> stolen<00:03:47.600> so

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
it's better than having them stolen so

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.470 
it's better than having them stolen so
next<00:03:49.580> what<00:03:49.760> we're<00:03:49.850> gonna<00:03:49.940> do<00:03:50.120> is<00:03:50.239> add<00:03:50.450> some

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
next what we're gonna do is add some

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.770 
next what we're gonna do is add some
noise<00:03:50.930> now<00:03:51.590> this<00:03:51.890> you<00:03:52.100> probably<00:03:52.730> won't<00:03:53.000> notice

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
noise now this you probably won't notice

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.680 
noise now this you probably won't notice
too<00:03:54.560> much<00:03:54.860> in<00:03:55.280> the<00:03:57.610> in<00:03:58.610> the<00:03:58.790> image<00:03:59.000> itself<00:03:59.390> but

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
too much in the in the image itself but

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.449 
too much in the in the image itself but
you<00:04:00.290> know<00:04:00.350> when<00:04:00.500> you<00:04:00.590> come<00:04:00.739> to<00:04:00.890> look<00:04:01.040> at<00:04:01.220> it<00:04:01.310> but

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
you know when you come to look at it but

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.979 
you know when you come to look at it but
it's<00:04:01.640> gonna<00:04:01.850> it's<00:04:02.209> just<00:04:02.269> gonna<00:04:03.489> again<00:04:04.810> mess<00:04:05.810> up

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
it's gonna it's just gonna again mess up

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:07.840 
it's gonna it's just gonna again mess up
anybody's<00:04:06.380> chances<00:04:06.830> of<00:04:06.980> picking<00:04:07.640> it<00:04:07.790> apart

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
anybody's chances of picking it apart

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.960 
anybody's chances of picking it apart
with<00:04:08.239> a<00:04:08.799> magic<00:04:09.799> one<00:04:10.040> tool<00:04:10.370> because<00:04:10.730> it's<00:04:10.850> going

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
with a magic one tool because it's going

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.120 
with a magic one tool because it's going
to<00:04:11.060> put<00:04:11.269> some<00:04:11.480> put<00:04:12.140> some<00:04:12.320> sort<00:04:12.590> of<00:04:12.650> noise

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
to put some put some sort of noise

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.430 
to put some put some sort of noise
across<00:04:13.519> our<00:04:13.820> image<00:04:14.120> so<00:04:14.870> I'm<00:04:14.930> going<00:04:15.080> to<00:04:15.110> start

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
across our image so I'm going to start

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.250 
across our image so I'm going to start
by<00:04:15.709> again<00:04:16.010> just<00:04:16.370> making<00:04:16.760> this<00:04:17.720> is<00:04:17.870> a<00:04:17.900> greater

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
by again just making this is a greater

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.909 
by again just making this is a greater
gray<00:04:18.590> a<00:04:19.750> lighter<00:04:20.750> gray<00:04:21.049> -<00:04:21.109> slightly<00:04:21.500> darker

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
gray and one just below it now when we

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.399 
gray and one just below it now when we
when<00:04:32.159> we<00:04:32.190> overlay<00:04:32.610> this<00:04:33.050> you're<00:04:34.050> gonna<00:04:34.169> have

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:34.409 
when we overlay this you're gonna have

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:36.110 
when we overlay this you're gonna have
it's<00:04:34.680> going<00:04:34.830> to<00:04:34.889> lighten<00:04:35.340> one<00:04:35.550> side<00:04:35.789> ever<00:04:35.970> so

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
it's going to lighten one side ever so

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.270 
it's going to lighten one side ever so
slightly<00:04:36.360> darken<00:04:36.900> the<00:04:36.990> other<00:04:37.110> you<00:04:37.919> don't<00:04:38.099> have

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
slightly darken the other you don't have

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.730 
slightly darken the other you don't have
to<00:04:38.400> do<00:04:38.520> this<00:04:38.610> you<00:04:38.789> can<00:04:38.940> just<00:04:38.970> use<00:04:39.530> it<00:04:40.530> a

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
to do this you can just use it a

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.279 
to do this you can just use it a
straight<00:04:41.190> gray<00:04:41.400> but<00:04:41.580> I<00:04:41.639> kind<00:04:41.849> of<00:04:41.909> like<00:04:42.090> to

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.289 
straight gray but I kind of like to

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:47.059 
straight gray but I kind of like to
again<00:04:43.289> just<00:04:43.470> add<00:04:43.770> another<00:04:43.979> layer<00:04:44.250> of<00:04:45.979> you<00:04:46.979> know

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:47.069 
again just add another layer of you know

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:49.790 
again just add another layer of you know
noise<00:04:47.370> to<00:04:47.669> the<00:04:47.759> image<00:04:48.259> so<00:04:49.259> now<00:04:49.289> we're<00:04:49.500> gonna<00:04:49.590> go

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
noise to the image so now we're gonna go

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.230 
noise to the image so now we're gonna go
noise<00:04:50.789> add<00:04:51.750> noise<00:04:52.639> again<00:04:53.639> you<00:04:53.759> can<00:04:53.879> see<00:04:54.060> here

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
noise add noise again you can see here

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.570 
noise add noise again you can see here
it's<00:04:54.389> quite<00:04:54.750> it's<00:04:55.379> quite<00:04:55.500> no<00:04:55.800> there's<00:04:56.310> quite<00:04:56.550> a

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
it's quite it's quite no there's quite a

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.520 
it's quite it's quite no there's quite a
lot<00:04:56.789> of<00:04:56.819> interference<00:04:57.780> with<00:04:58.110> the<00:04:58.229> image<00:04:58.409> at

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
lot of interference with the image at

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.110 
lot of interference with the image at
the<00:04:58.590> moment<00:04:58.860> so<00:04:59.460> we're<00:04:59.580> going<00:04:59.669> to<00:04:59.759> turn<00:05:00.060> that

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
the moment so we're going to turn that

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.029 
the moment so we're going to turn that
down<00:05:01.129> and<00:05:02.129> now<00:05:02.400> we've<00:05:02.580> got<00:05:02.789> something<00:05:03.060> that<00:05:03.719> is

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 
down and now we've got something that is

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:06.920 
down and now we've got something that is
quite<00:05:05.039> difficult<00:05:05.370> to<00:05:05.759> kind<00:05:06.030> of<00:05:06.090> pull<00:05:06.300> apart<00:05:06.659> or

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
quite difficult to kind of pull apart or

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.119 
quite difficult to kind of pull apart or
or<00:05:07.289> trace<00:05:08.629> just<00:05:09.629> with<00:05:10.590> regards<00:05:10.919> to<00:05:10.979> its

00:05:11.119 --> 00:05:11.129 
or trace just with regards to its

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:14.839 
or trace just with regards to its
colours<00:05:11.490> just<00:05:11.520> because<00:05:12.090> it's<00:05:12.270> a<00:05:13.550> little<00:05:14.550> more

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:14.849 
colours just because it's a little more

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:19.480 
colours just because it's a little more
a<00:05:15.539> little<00:05:15.870> more<00:05:16.139> difficult<00:05:17.069> to<00:05:17.099> pull<00:05:17.250> apart

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.450 

now<00:05:20.490> what<00:05:20.639> we're<00:05:20.729> gonna<00:05:20.849> do<00:05:21.090> is<00:05:21.419> add<00:05:22.259> some<00:05:22.650> blur

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
now what we're gonna do is add some blur

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.719 
now what we're gonna do is add some blur
to<00:05:23.729> the<00:05:23.819> image<00:05:24.120> so<00:05:24.990> what<00:05:25.199> you<00:05:26.099> need<00:05:26.219> to<00:05:26.310> do<00:05:26.430> here

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729 
to the image so what you need to do here

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:31.100 
to the image so what you need to do here
is<00:05:28.669> let<00:05:29.669> me<00:05:29.699> just<00:05:30.000> delete<00:05:30.300> that<00:05:30.479> that's<00:05:30.870> the

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
is let me just delete that that's the

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.040 
is let me just delete that that's the
old<00:05:31.259> one<00:05:31.440> so<00:05:32.370> again<00:05:33.360> we're<00:05:33.479> going<00:05:33.569> to<00:05:33.659> use<00:05:33.870> the

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
old one so again we're going to use the

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.659 
old one so again we're going to use the
gradient<00:05:34.229> tool<00:05:36.319> black<00:05:37.319> to<00:05:37.529> white<00:05:37.740> now<00:05:38.460> here

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669 
gradient tool black to white now here

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:43.820 
gradient tool black to white now here
what<00:05:38.789> we<00:05:38.819> want<00:05:39.029> to<00:05:39.120> create<00:05:39.270> is<00:05:40.340> a<00:05:42.680> black<00:05:43.680> to

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
what we want to create is a black to

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.680 
what we want to create is a black to
white<00:05:43.949> gradient<00:05:44.039> in<00:05:44.759> the<00:05:45.360> middle<00:05:45.569> of<00:05:45.630> the

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
white gradient in the middle of the

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:46.909 
white gradient in the middle of the
picture<00:05:45.960> but<00:05:46.110> we're<00:05:46.229> going<00:05:46.349> to<00:05:46.409> do<00:05:46.590> this<00:05:46.710> in

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 
picture but we're going to do this in

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:49.730 
picture but we're going to do this in
the<00:05:47.009> channels<00:05:47.779> so<00:05:48.779> we're<00:05:48.900> going<00:05:48.990> to<00:05:49.050> create<00:05:49.319> an

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
the channels so we're going to create an

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:55.519 
the channels so we're going to create an
alpha<00:05:50.099> channel<00:05:50.430> here<00:05:50.639> and<00:05:53.419> there<00:05:54.419> we<00:05:54.509> go<00:05:54.690> white

00:05:55.519 --> 00:05:55.529 
alpha channel here and there we go white

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:56.119 
alpha channel here and there we go white
in<00:05:55.620> the<00:05:55.680> middle

00:05:56.119 --> 00:05:56.129 
in the middle

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:58.790 
in the middle
black<00:05:56.819> people<00:05:56.969> site<00:05:57.330> now<00:05:57.810> this<00:05:57.990> relates<00:05:58.529> to

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
black people site now this relates to

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.040 
black people site now this relates to
how<00:05:59.099> much<00:05:59.430> each<00:06:00.330> part<00:06:00.629> of<00:06:00.659> the<00:06:00.750> image<00:06:00.930> is<00:06:00.960> going

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
how much each part of the image is going

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.140 
how much each part of the image is going
to<00:06:01.169> be<00:06:01.229> blurred<00:06:01.500> the<00:06:02.219> white<00:06:02.430> part<00:06:02.699> won't<00:06:03.029> be

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
to be blurred the white part won't be

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:04.939 
to be blurred the white part won't be
played<00:06:03.300> at<00:06:03.449> all<00:06:03.599> the<00:06:04.020> black<00:06:04.229> part<00:06:04.500> is<00:06:04.680> going<00:06:04.889> to

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:04.949 
played at all the black part is going to

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:07.219 
played at all the black part is going to
be<00:06:05.009> blurred<00:06:05.250> the<00:06:05.370> most<00:06:05.610> and<00:06:06.419> with<00:06:06.750> it<00:06:06.870> with<00:06:07.050> the

in<00:06:33.089> you<00:06:33.630> can<00:06:33.779> see<00:06:33.960> the<00:06:34.229> reason<00:06:34.860> why<00:06:34.949> we

00:06:35.089 --> 00:06:35.099 
in you can see the reason why we

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:37.250 
in you can see the reason why we
flattened<00:06:35.580> it<00:06:35.699> to<00:06:36.210> the<00:06:36.330> bottom<00:06:36.599> to<00:06:36.930> the

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:37.260 
flattened it to the bottom to the

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.320 
flattened it to the bottom to the
-<00:06:37.710> the<00:06:37.800> color<00:06:38.010> layer<00:06:38.220> is<00:06:38.640> that<00:06:39.000> you<00:06:39.090> don't<00:06:39.240> get

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330 
- the color layer is that you don't get

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.740 
- the color layer is that you don't get
this<00:06:39.480> kind<00:06:39.720> of<00:06:39.990> garbage<00:06:41.120> garbage<00:06:42.120> black<00:06:42.510> layer

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:42.750 
this kind of garbage garbage black layer

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.020 
this kind of garbage garbage black layer
around<00:06:42.930> the<00:06:43.170> edge<00:06:43.610> so<00:06:44.610> I'm<00:06:44.670> going<00:06:44.790> to<00:06:44.850> cancel

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:45.030 
around the edge so I'm going to cancel

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.200 
around the edge so I'm going to cancel
that<00:06:45.440> oops

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:47.210 
that oops

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:52.190 
that oops
select<00:06:48.210> the<00:06:48.270> whole<00:06:48.420> thing<00:06:49.670> crop<00:06:50.670> and<00:06:51.510> then

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:52.200 
select the whole thing crop and then

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.570 
select the whole thing crop and then
just<00:06:52.440> do<00:06:52.560> the<00:06:52.620> same<00:06:52.710> thing<00:06:52.920> again<00:06:53.190> and<00:06:53.490> that

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:53.580 
just do the same thing again and that

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.310 
just do the same thing again and that
will<00:06:53.730> get<00:06:53.850> rid<00:06:53.910> of<00:06:54.090> that<00:06:54.180> outside<00:06:54.630> layer<00:06:55.110> now

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:55.320 
will get rid of that outside layer now

00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:02.510 
will get rid of that outside layer now
so<00:06:57.650> lens<00:06:58.650> blur<00:07:00.680> and<00:07:01.680> now<00:07:01.770> we<00:07:01.830> can<00:07:02.040> see<00:07:02.160> our<00:07:02.310> lens

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.520 
so lens blur and now we can see our lens

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.550 
so lens blur and now we can see our lens
blur<00:07:02.700> and<00:07:03.300> that's<00:07:03.510> just<00:07:03.720> like<00:07:03.900> taking<00:07:04.230> a<00:07:04.290> short

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 
blur and that's just like taking a short

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.060 
blur and that's just like taking a short
depth<00:07:04.830> of<00:07:04.980> field<00:07:05.130> photo<00:07:05.430> across<00:07:06.060> the<00:07:06.240> image

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:07.070 
depth of field photo across the image

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.130 
depth of field photo across the image
and<00:07:08.070> it<00:07:08.700> makes<00:07:08.880> these<00:07:09.030> lines<00:07:09.360> impossible<00:07:10.020> to

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:10.140 
and it makes these lines impossible to

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:11.870 
and it makes these lines impossible to
kind<00:07:10.320> of<00:07:10.410> pick<00:07:10.590> apart<00:07:10.710> and<00:07:11.130> recolor<00:07:11.700> in

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:11.880 
kind of pick apart and recolor in

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:17.440 
kind of pick apart and recolor in
Photoshop<00:07:13.070> so<00:07:14.070> now<00:07:14.250> there<00:07:14.880> we<00:07:15.000> go<00:07:15.380> there's<00:07:16.380> our

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:17.450 
Photoshop so now there we go there's our

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:20.450 
Photoshop so now there we go there's our
cardinal
