00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.980
 Hello everyone today, I'll show you how we are 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.760
 changing the pile 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:13.170
 we have a very coarse soil and me 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.599
 I grow some plants here 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.520
 there is some small part here and another 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:24.210
 Larger goes and we decided to change it 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:29.279
 what we did cast most of the water 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.439
 in a tank that's such a big 10 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.680
 Peter well 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:39.170
 pot planted plants and fish there 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:44.219
 set what we put there 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:50.210
 heater and compressor in general and 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:52.590
 Now we will select the ground here and 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:58.109
 sleep foot shallow soil 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:02.879
 I chose a large one now 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:04.129
 we will choose a large soil to drain it 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.450
 gomola 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:11.060
 lay the substrate general further you all 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.060
 will see the aquarium fully withdrawal 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.780
 wiped dry 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.729
 so here and took and just the substrate 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:38.310
 I digress here so it looks in principle 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.159
 no fertilizer for plants and I 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:45.270
 no more add missing yet 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:49.080
 us so brewing was four years before the crime 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:53.490
 no for plants just added 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:59.520
 we had a cover under it already 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:04.020
 It is a fertilizer that's well and to 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:09.239
 This substrate I now level it for 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:13.739
 so that this substrate as it were when we 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:17.180
 we clean the soil before we change water 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:20.610
 start to clean the soil a little 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:29.040
 so that it does not go anywhere we are 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:32.610
 top we put the grid for the usual shorter 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.160
 speaking for such a mesh now i'm her 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.730
 cut out 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:42.030
 for plaster mesh we took this 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:44.130
 tassel and krasin k so leveled it in 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:50.329
 principle not necessarily but more so or 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.329
 less uniform was to see how 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:03:00.560
 we put the net so not super it 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:17.130
 exactly more or less cover like this we 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:20.430
 the cult was spread out a part of this old one 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:26.010
 the ground is left after all the rest we 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:29.430
 replaced by small black and now we will 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:33.030
 poured one not finished yet 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.320
 principle we are creating a new settling water 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.949
 it will be all 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.979
 and a little bit yes yes sadim plant that's 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:48.169
 such a nightmare suffered but through time 

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:48.169
 the actor will sit down I will show the result
