it where it can't kill them now you're

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.020 
it where it can't kill them now you're
going<00:01:09.710> to<00:01:09.770> have<00:01:09.860> to<00:01:10.009> nudge<00:01:10.250> this<00:01:10.490> ever<00:01:10.759> so

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
going to have to nudge this ever so

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.749 
going to have to nudge this ever so
slightly<00:01:11.360> constantly<00:01:12.320> with<00:01:12.619> this<00:01:12.799> thing<00:01:13.070> some

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
slightly constantly with this thing some

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:15.130 
slightly constantly with this thing some
people<00:01:14.060> could<00:01:14.210> probably<00:01:14.450> do<00:01:14.720> when<00:01:14.930> they<00:01:15.020> have

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
people could probably do when they have

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.200 
people could probably do when they have
to<00:01:15.289> speed<00:01:15.590> up<00:01:15.770> button<00:01:16.100> on<00:01:16.250> didn't<00:01:16.940> make<00:01:17.090> your

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
to speed up button on didn't make your

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.919 
to speed up button on didn't make your
ship<00:01:17.420> go<00:01:17.600> faster<00:01:17.630> I<00:01:18.229> can't<00:01:18.679> I<00:01:19.179> lack<00:01:20.179> the<00:01:20.450> skills

00:01:20.919 --> 00:01:20.929 
ship go faster I can't I lack the skills

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:23.830 
ship go faster I can't I lack the skills
to<00:01:21.440> do<00:01:21.619> it<00:01:22.030> and<00:01:23.030> you<00:01:23.119> got<00:01:23.240> to<00:01:23.360> wrap<00:01:23.569> it<00:01:23.750> around

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
to do it and you got to wrap it around

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.590 
to do it and you got to wrap it around
like<00:01:24.140> three<00:01:24.470> times<00:01:24.789> the<00:01:25.789> controls<00:01:26.330> are<00:01:26.539> pretty

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
like three times the controls are pretty

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.870 
like three times the controls are pretty
good<00:01:27.110> for<00:01:27.319> this<00:01:27.440> one<00:01:27.740> but<00:01:28.130> this<00:01:28.190> was<00:01:28.520> the<00:01:28.550> worst

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
good for this one but this was the worst

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.169 
good for this one but this was the worst
it<00:01:29.179> was<00:01:29.360> control<00:01:29.929> wise<00:01:30.289> to<00:01:30.710> wrap<00:01:31.670> around<00:01:31.850> I

00:01:32.169 --> 00:01:32.179 
it was control wise to wrap around I

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:34.540 
it was control wise to wrap around I
mean<00:01:32.300> look<00:01:32.569> my<00:01:33.050> tow<00:01:33.110> cable<00:01:33.710> is<00:01:33.860> even<00:01:34.159> on<00:01:34.250> one<00:01:34.429> of

mean look my tow cable is even on one of

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.340 
mean look my tow cable is even on one of
the<00:01:34.610> legs<00:01:34.819> when<00:01:35.060> it<00:01:35.149> moves

I<00:03:31.490> find<00:03:32.490> the<00:03:32.640> walkers<00:03:33.060> to<00:03:33.210> be<00:03:33.330> easy<00:03:33.600> this<00:03:34.440> is

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
I find the walkers to be easy this is

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.560 
I find the walkers to be easy this is
there<00:03:34.830> they're<00:03:35.190> easy<00:03:35.430> swarm<00:03:36.000> there<00:03:36.270> are<00:03:36.360> a<00:03:36.390> lot

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
there they're easy swarm there are a lot

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.340 
there they're easy swarm there are a lot
harder<00:03:36.780> when<00:03:37.080> people<00:03:37.470> are<00:03:37.560> shooting<00:03:37.860> at<00:03:38.160> you

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
harder when people are shooting at you

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.840 
harder when people are shooting at you
but<00:03:40.350> that'll<00:03:40.680> happen<00:03:40.830> in<00:03:41.100> a<00:03:41.130> later<00:03:41.400> mission

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
but that'll happen in a later mission

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:48.130 
but that'll happen in a later mission
that<00:03:41.970> will<00:03:42.090> make<00:03:42.300> me<00:03:42.450> cry

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:52.660 
I guess a in Rogue Squadron two and
three<00:03:51.020> for<00:03:51.290> the<00:03:51.380> Gamecube<00:03:51.920> they<00:03:52.069> really<00:03:52.459> got

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
three for the Gamecube they really got

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.570 
three for the Gamecube they really got
this<00:03:53.000> part<00:03:53.750> of<00:03:53.840> the<00:03:53.930> game<00:03:54.140> you<00:03:54.500> know<00:03:54.650> a<00:03:54.950> lot

this part of the game you know a lot
more<00:03:55.640> solid<00:03:56.360> I<00:03:56.600> felt<00:03:57.230> a<00:03:57.440> lot<00:03:57.590> smoother<00:03:58.130> but

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
more solid I felt a lot smoother but

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.130 
more solid I felt a lot smoother but
this<00:03:59.000> was<00:03:59.240> a<00:03:59.330> lot<00:03:59.810> better<00:04:00.020> than<00:04:01.990> shadows<00:04:02.990> of
