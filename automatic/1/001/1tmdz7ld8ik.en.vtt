00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.929 
now I have actually got a fork and
stabbed<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.220> little<00:01:38.400> bit<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.640> make<00:01:38.759> little

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939

batter<00:04:16.590> slices<00:04:17.100> so<00:04:17.730> what<00:04:17.820> I'm<00:04:17.910> going<00:04:18.000> to<00:04:18.060> do

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
batter slices so what I'm going to do

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.690 
batter slices so what I'm going to do
now<00:04:18.359> is<00:04:18.630> flip<00:04:18.900> them<00:04:19.140> over<00:04:19.260> so<00:04:19.830> that<00:04:19.859> oil<00:04:20.310> side

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700
