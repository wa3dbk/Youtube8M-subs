00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
smokes this is something that people

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.179 
smokes this is something that people
will<00:01:38.090> be<00:01:38.119> able<00:01:38.270> to<00:01:38.450> use<00:01:38.509> to<00:01:39.079> designate<00:01:39.950> targets

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
and things in coop wings smokes also use

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.100 
and things in coop wings smokes also use
tactically<00:01:43.009> in<00:01:43.670> a<00:01:43.729> tank<00:01:44.030> you<00:01:44.179> can<00:01:44.420> watch<00:01:44.780> smoke

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
tactically in a tank you can watch smoke

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.230 
tactically in a tank you can watch smoke
shells<00:01:45.409> and<00:01:46.039> they<00:01:46.220> create<00:01:46.670> a<00:01:46.729> mask<00:01:46.970> for

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
shells and they create a mask for

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.359 
shells and they create a mask for
emulators<00:01:47.960> so<00:01:48.259> it's<00:01:48.500> harder<00:01:48.950> to<00:01:48.979> shoot<00:01:49.280> the

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
emulators so it's harder to shoot the

you<00:03:03.420> can<00:03:03.450> strip<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:03.840> scene<00:03:04.140> down<00:03:04.409> to<00:03:04.680> basic<00:03:05.579> a

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
you can strip the scene down to basic a

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.300 
you can strip the scene down to basic a
basic<00:03:06.060> surface<00:03:06.569> and<00:03:06.840> lights<00:03:07.170> that<00:03:07.680> surface<00:03:08.159> on

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
the tape and that's quite

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.000 
the tape and that's quite
straightforward<00:03:09.660> to<00:03:09.750> do<00:03:09.900> so<00:03:10.530> we<00:03:10.650> start<00:03:10.950> with

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
straightforward to do so we start with

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.099 
straightforward to do so we start with
deferred<00:03:11.400> lights<00:03:11.700> then<00:03:12.420> we<00:03:12.569> add<00:03:12.599> ambient

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
deferred lights then we add ambient

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:14.930 
deferred lights then we add ambient
light<00:03:13.230> with<00:03:13.470> occlusion<00:03:13.980> and<00:03:14.099> directional

lighting followed by surface diffuse and
Atmospheric<00:03:18.829> finally<00:03:19.829> we<00:03:20.069> treat<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.370> scene

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
Atmospheric finally we treat the scene

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.930
