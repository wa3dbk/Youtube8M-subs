00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.229 
it make any sense it doesn't to me but
at<00:02:33.450> any<00:02:33.630> rate<00:02:34.400> they've<00:02:35.400> included<00:02:35.730> it<00:02:36.060> once

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
at any rate they've included it once

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.509 
at any rate they've included it once
again<00:02:36.390> with<00:02:36.630> this<00:02:36.750> figure<00:02:37.160> so<00:02:38.160> we'll<00:02:38.280> put<00:02:38.430> it

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
aside the other accessories I guess

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.610

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
really so much the head but what the

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.949 
really so much the head but what the
head<00:03:28.680> is<00:03:28.799> sitting<00:03:29.099> on<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:30.060> neck<00:03:30.390> could<00:03:30.810> be<00:03:30.840> a

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
head is sitting on the neck could be a

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.979 
head is sitting on the neck could be a
little<00:03:31.319> wider<00:03:32.420> because<00:03:33.420> it<00:03:33.540> almost<00:03:33.659> looks

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
little wider because it almost looks

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.839 
little wider because it almost looks
like<00:03:34.079> he's<00:03:34.319> got<00:03:34.440> a<00:03:34.500> really<00:03:34.859> scrawny<00:03:35.340> neck<00:03:35.579> and

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
like he's got a really scrawny neck and

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.849 
like he's got a really scrawny neck and
then<00:03:35.940> he's<00:03:36.060> got<00:03:36.269> a<00:03:36.319> little<00:03:37.319> bit<00:03:37.440> bigger<00:03:37.560> of<00:03:37.769> a

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
then he's got a little bit bigger of a

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.190 
then he's got a little bit bigger of a
head<00:03:38.069> the<00:03:38.579> head<00:03:38.760> all<00:03:38.940> almost<00:03:39.269> looks<00:03:39.780> like<00:03:39.870> it

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
head the head all almost looks like it

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.330 
head the head all almost looks like it
doesn't<00:03:40.409> belong<00:03:42.440> but<00:03:43.440> it<00:03:43.530> is<00:03:43.680> it<00:03:43.980> is<00:03:44.040> a<00:03:44.159> nice

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
doesn't belong but it is it is a nice

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.319 
doesn't belong but it is it is a nice
head<00:03:44.579> sculpt<00:03:46.730> is<00:03:47.730> certainly<00:03:48.120> nicely<00:03:48.599> detailed

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
head sculpt is certainly nicely detailed

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:53.059 
head sculpt is certainly nicely detailed
but<00:03:51.329> I<00:03:51.510> think<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:51.840> real<00:03:52.169> self<00:03:52.560> for<00:03:52.799> me<00:03:52.950> at

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
but I think the real self for me at

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.629 
but I think the real self for me at
least<00:03:53.099> is<00:03:53.609> the<00:03:54.200> the<00:03:55.200> excellent<00:03:55.829> body<00:03:56.099> sculpt

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639 
least is the the excellent body sculpt

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:59.659 
least is the the excellent body sculpt
on<00:03:56.849> this<00:03:57.389> on<00:03:57.630> this<00:03:57.840> figure<00:03:58.370> the<00:03:59.370> cape<00:03:59.519> is

this shoulder is fine I have no problems
with<00:05:19.259> it<00:05:19.349> all<00:05:19.469> with<00:05:19.649> the<00:05:19.739> shoulder<00:05:20.039> you'll

00:05:20.209 --> 00:05:20.219 
with it all with the shoulder you'll

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:23.629 
with it all with the shoulder you'll
notice<00:05:20.519> the<00:05:20.999> arm<00:05:21.149> sits<00:05:21.929> not<00:05:22.649> flush<00:05:23.129> but<00:05:23.519> it

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 
notice the arm sits not flush but it

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:26.029 
notice the arm sits not flush but it
certainly<00:05:23.819> sits<00:05:24.299> further<00:05:24.629> in<00:05:24.929> than<00:05:25.529> this<00:05:25.769> arm

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:26.039 
certainly sits further in than this arm

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:30.919 
right here this arm is tight I can
barely<00:05:30.059> get<00:05:30.179> it<00:05:30.329> to<00:05:30.449> move

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:30.929 
barely get it to move

00:05:30.929 --> 00:05:33.169 
barely get it to move
I<00:05:30.959> might<00:05:31.709> have<00:05:31.860> to<00:05:32.039> finagle<00:05:32.429> it<00:05:32.729> a<00:05:32.849> little<00:05:33.059> bit

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:33.179 
I might have to finagle it a little bit

00:05:33.179 --> 00:05:37.569 
I might have to finagle it a little bit
more<00:05:33.360> to<00:05:33.569> get<00:05:33.719> it<00:05:33.839> going<00:05:34.819> but<00:05:35.819> he<00:05:36.779> has<00:05:36.899> also<00:05:37.110> got

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:37.579 
more to get it going but he has also got
