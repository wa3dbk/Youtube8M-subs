00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:17.060
 how about friends friends now with a lot 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:20.240
 we'll see how to make pans 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:23.390
 non-sticks or pans that they already had 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.120
 Teflon or other things that have been thrown out 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.880
 lose with him 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.580
 it's very economical we can do it in 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.910
 house all we need is in 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:37.030
 our house what we need is 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.560
 oil that we have used at home 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.430
 if we like it that way 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:45.470
 a little bit of oil mark whatever it is not 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.030
 it really matters 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:52.870
 and a small bath to a napkin 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.870
 any of those people 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.560
 how this pan is already very worn 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.490
 very used is more I was going to throw it to the 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:04.320
 trash 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:07.830
 what do we need to do number 1 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:12.720
 we put some oil 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:17.070
 and with the small cloth or with the 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:20.190
 napkin we will go extended 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.010
 especially where you have nothing and you 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:26.100
 support well please to penetrate 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.890
 the oil before they need to wash very well 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.890
 the pan to remove the porous things 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.710
 anything of that truth then 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.020
 It is as if to tighten a bit the 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.340
 napkin so that it allows very well is 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.770
 very very well in the oil streaks 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.770
 this remember please and I will be very 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.020
 repetitive you have to do it about two or 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.500
 three times depending on the pan 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:56.160
 depended on the heat oil many 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.289
 actors I repeat you have to repeat it several 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.570
 times and I will be giving maintenance 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:04.500
 Occasionally we will pay a little 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:07.659
 Salt especially where we no longer have the 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:11.489
 Non-stick catch 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:15.519
 but that's where we should put a 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:18.430
 little bit more of this if they want to do it 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:21.040
 it works in the two ways it does not 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.500
 I worry about the fact of the two forms and 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.900
 That's the way the pans are and it saves me 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.920
 we need to turn on the 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:33.430
 stove and we're going to let you have a good time 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:37.230
 you have to burn the oil with the salt 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:42.060
 or the oil just for smoke came out 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:46.209
 amazing please much one will see 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:49.720
 how they see in this first part and start 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:53.739
 to get out a little bit of bealo you are a 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.840
 very little now I know if they see 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:59.440
 changed color begins to put 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.580
 yellow the oil and it starts to come out more 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.630
 blue 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:07.570
 more heat because we have more time and 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:11.650
 See how he keeps eating more and more 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:16.420
 strong and now see you after 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:19.840
 a while how will the smoke be if it is 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.750
 very strong and the aroma post oil burns 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.780
 less you and how has it been 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.670
 I ask for favor, I have done it in the 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.500
 pans the least I 've had that 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.390
 do to make it like 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.960
 Teflon original or before the entity 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.810
 original about four times that I start 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:41.080
 cooking burns a little bit I wash it with 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.000
 Care nothing more with a cloth we're going to 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.940
 remove at first do not see it with 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.459
 detergent and less with fiber because it 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.770
 the Teflon must be done that is 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:53.709
 dirty with a rag with water and a 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.420
 napkin nothing else let's remove it not 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.280
 is going to paint the food is not going to happen 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.140
 nothing by the smoke 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.300
 nothing nothing is going to happen 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.200
 are several times what I have had to 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.290
 do look 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.959
 see this pan I made all that layer 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.660
 it was the one I made with the oil that 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:14.750
 it was because for the time and they are pans 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:18.380
 look for you that cost 400 600 800 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:20.750
 weights above all this great 202 there are 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.570
 do it several missives as it cleans 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.120
 with a rag and after using them done the 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:30.110
 a little bit of oil and leave it there 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:33.210
 rest and they will see what good pans 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:36.479
