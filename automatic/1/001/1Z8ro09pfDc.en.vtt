00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.529
 Hello everyone today I want to tell 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:18.660
 about my favorite sweet gainers 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:21.810
 general mainly meant for people 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:26.490
 who want to gain mass ginger this 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:30.929
 a mixture of carbohydrates and proteins, they differ 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:34.079
 according to the degree of purification also add additives 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.980
 inside it come on amino acid others 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.010
 components 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.020
 but still 90 percent is 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.120
 about carbohydrates's most 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.480
 high protein gainer is about 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.030
 thirty percent also happens less 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.379
 about ten percent but they are more 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:55.949
 cheap gainers are different in that they are 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:59.969
 eat more from fast carbs and either 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.190
 complex carbohydrates complex carbohydrates they 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.270
 much better for a person why 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.430
 that fast carbohydrates are mostly in 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.090
 the composition of the fucking day general this 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.090
 maltodextrin meaning it raises 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.509
 fast blood sugar and just as fast 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.180
 he ends up complex carbohydrates they 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.330
 longer period of time 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:26.820
 supports energy in the body therefore 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.000
 cheaper general 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.280
 there are rough lario sugar which you 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.920
 buy at a price several times higher 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.150
 either swum out can buy just been 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.939
 quality gamer who already have carbohydrates 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.250
 go more difficult that is from two to 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:48.030
 four hours can organism 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:51.800
 let's energy here we can see 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:55.140
 to different manufacturers mostly me 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.810
 recommend some 9 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.150
 optimum nutrition universal and ours 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.950
 Ukrainian manufacturers ata power pro 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:08.160
 how do they differ well principled 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.610
 Opium, though the brand is untwisted and expensive 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.490
 but here there was a cool quality 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:17.489
 dismantling in principle is also good and legs 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.920
 the price is slightly lower than the principle of who 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:23.310
 wants to see results for small 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.800
 money was it possible brother dima then of 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.780
 either with the ultimate universe such from the firm 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.260
 Of course, our Ukrainian 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.750
 manufacturer supported by our 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.790
 manufacturer and there is a big 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.760
 advantage first became the course 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.830
 amino acids fuck that already with 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.489
 the first minute to restore the body 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.350
 secondly here I am 100 grams 30 grams 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.280
 pure protein ie it is a high protein 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.060
 gainer 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.280
 besides here go complex carbohydrates 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:56.430
 which provide us amazing 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.799
 energy now we'll talk about taking 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.850
 geyner basically take it up 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:06.120
 workouts in the form of cocktails can it 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.549
 take with milk or water with milk still 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.240
 addition you will be there 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:13.000
 items that 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.950
 contributing to muscle growth and that's why 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.880
 I recommend with milk if not 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.740
 the possibilities of this are of course plain water 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.810
 It means to accept and he and higher until 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.510
 workouts to throughout 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.870
 the whole workout was energy and so was 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.490
 after training it opens like this 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.940
 called protein carbohydrate window 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.400
 which need to close first and 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.780
 in the body to recover 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.640
 energy costs which he 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.740
 lost in training therefore 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.340
 sure to take a gainer for those who 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.660
 wants to gain weight for those who 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.610
 let 's start drying already a gainer 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.290
 fits because there are additional 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.890
 calories 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:56.560
 will also be u famous just in fatty 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.540
 interlayers so for those who are much better 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.550
 use either pure protein or 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.380
 amino acids but at the moment we 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.050
 talking about the people who want 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.210
 gain mass in each and gainers have 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.880
 your dosages are written here 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.370
 packaging for example power pro 10 dosages 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.700
 very small connections with big 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:19.270
 protein and amino acid concentrations and 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:22.780
 let's make another component here 40 

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:26.200
 gram one portion will start already in the union 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:30.220
 array of portions are very large private 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:32.650
 they are 334 grams one serving yet i 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.140
 I recommend this portion one break into 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.930
 two techniques to better assimilated and 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:40.180
 proteins and carbohydrates that is let 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.010
 and half a serving before training half 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.800
 portions after training this will 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.450
 quite enough to remind you again 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.360
 I have already said the previous video that 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:53.740
 general and other other sports 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:56.380
 food is not and power replacement so we 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:59.260
 some generals really can not get a lot 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:02.500
 be sure to eat well as 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:05.890
 at least up to 5 times a day it is small 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:09.160
 but eat portions and quality food and 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:11.380
 General Obama will help just dial 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.080
 and extra carbohydrates and 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.240
 squirrel thank you for watching the video 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.340
 I hope you will find it useful 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:22.200
 eat properly exercise 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.200
 and be happy bye bye
