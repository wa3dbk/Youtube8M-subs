 hello we are going with a new simple recipe 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:11.980
 and with few ingredients that is how I 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.809
 they like me 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.339
 'We have thawed the octopus 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.259
 past a water and we have left it 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:19.029
 drain and now we are going to cook it in 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:21.340
 abundant boiling water I think what of 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.259
 scare him three times does not help much 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.329
 but just in case we put it in and what 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:28.000
 we take three times and then we go to 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:29.950
 leave it half an hour plus seven minutes per 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.559
 kilo that weighs this weighs something more than a 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.780
 kilo so I'll leave it about 40 minutes and 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:36.820
 As you told me, you already live jana chef del 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.649
 lounge a tarragona restaurant 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.170
 I'm going to put you in addition to a couple of leaves 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:43.000
 of laurel a tea bag that gives you a 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.890
 interesting touch especially of color 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.460
 and when it breaks the boil down the 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.230
 fire 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.059
 on the other hand we cut the onions in 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.890
 Juliana and put them in a casserole 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.230
 low with a good jet of oil 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.019
 olive add the garlic cut in 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:59.339
 plates and pepper we stir well and 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:59.339
 we let simmer 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:07.040
 With 20 minutes to be the 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.040
 octopus we add the potatoes 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.170
 and after that time we put out the fire 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.500
 we remove the octopus and let it 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.179
 cool to be able to manipulate and while 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.890
 we add the white wine glass to the 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:21.689
 onion we raise the fire so that 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.939
 reduce well and once reduced 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.799
 we can incorporate the chopped octopus 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.420
 previously with a knife or cut 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.420
 directly with scissors 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.790
 we remove and now we are going to incorporate the 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.750
 sweet paprika we raise the fire and what 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.750
 we fry a little 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.680
 we incorporate the peeled potatoes and 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.680
 chopped 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.500
 and finally we are going to add a bit of 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.420
 broth to cook the octopus we leave it a 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.830
 couple of minutes more and this is already good 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.310
