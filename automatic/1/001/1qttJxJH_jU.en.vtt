00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:07.859
 the staff here the class water pump 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.240
 to 160 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:14.040
 she was leaking they may notice 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.279
 here is the mark of the 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.380
 water while running the 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.000
 motorola not now but once it stopped 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.960
 due to pressure with this ratio 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.140
 I believe that by law chi and winston 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.420
 touching the pump is no need to download the 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.489
 added to change good tone 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.399
 but I do not know said in the boring way 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.809
 because it's too tight 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.079
 I'll explain to you how I am. 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.079
 making 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.260
 she stands in that position 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:55.559
 I'm clearing the book, I only have one 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:07.830
 position she enters that had already 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:09.180
 put in box 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.479
 I will not explain to you first. 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.479
 step is to loosen the pulley 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:28.830
 loosen the pulley bolts're 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:33.690
 are four screws your four 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:35.100
 screws are you put the car on 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.170
 neutral 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.400
 complete the key you turn a position 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:45.900
 The better you release, the better the position. 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:49.229
 you first release a key to 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.590
 debut of the step you drop two 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.590
 screws 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.140
 then you unseat turn around again 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.910
 position to release the other two 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.990
 straight 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:08.910
 if you drop the pulley you go there 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.560
 underneath the chain tensioner and 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:15.420
 a key of 15 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:22.640
 You're going to let go. You're going to relieve it. 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:25.709
 pressure on the belt on the pole strap 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.220
 You can already take out the belt pulley. 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.360
 pole will get subject after release 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.250
 pole strap 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:37.970
 you will loosen the spindles that hold the 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.970
 Water pump 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.480
 Then she'll be alone. 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:56.959
 only that it is difficult to draw here for you 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:03:05.070
 will you get her you have to drop the 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:08.080
 the control chain tensioner and is 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:11.800
 that piece that 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:14.790
 it is he who tightens the chain guide of the 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.900
 command that was just occurring from common 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:21.460
 You have to take them, not you. 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:25.050
 Get the ball out of there. 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.050
 done that's just
