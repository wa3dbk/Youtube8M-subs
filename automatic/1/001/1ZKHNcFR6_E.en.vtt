00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:13.200
 the external floors of your premises as 

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:15.690
 makes them all loading docks 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.720
 are especially when they are wet 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.520
 source of many accidents 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.320
 to avoid this kind of inconvenience 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.660
 we recommend the involvement 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.250
 an epoxy paint like epoxy 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.410
 Maxi flu with its anti-slip finish 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.380
 secure well attended ground while 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.720
 giving it an aesthetic appearance before 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.880
 to continue make sure you bring yourself 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.940
 of a pair of gloves from a stick to 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.760
 mix of a paint mixer with a 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.590
 paint tray with a paintbrush and a 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.300
 medium nap roll with his sleeve 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.489
 telescopic concrete to be painted must 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.460
 be at least four weeks old 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.770
 clean and dry all traces of oil or 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.989
 fat must be cleaned with a 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.100
 industrial degreaser as the degree 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.470
 ground smooth concrete floors or with 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.870
 milt need to be thought of or 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.790
 treat with acid treatment as 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.390
 the ground caps to improve 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.390
 adhesion 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.320
 let's turn now to the preparation of 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:22.930
 the painting 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.780
 mix together the resin cans 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.090
 and hardener then pour into the 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.720
 big can by mixing until 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.430
 that a uniform color is obtained 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.950
 do not add anti-slip aggregates 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.990
 now once mixed together 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.689
 both components heat up very 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.479
 quickly to avoid painting 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:45.729
 do not harden too quickly decanted there in 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.789
 the paint tray and apply there 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:51.940
 immediately started by painting the 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:53.649
 edges of the area with the brush 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.200
 then use the roller to coat 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:58.890
 ways to apply on areas of 5 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.890
 square meters 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.039
 so should particles now 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.380
 slip on fresh paint 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:08.250
 to obtain the desired finish 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.750
 slightly or strongly anti slip 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.600
 pass the roll again for the 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.140
 evenly distribute coated elite in 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.540
 the painting 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.610
 you do not normally need to 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.410
 put some paint on the roll at 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.690
 less of having sprinkled a large 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.060
 quantity of aggregates once 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.579
 the finished application protect from water 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.920
 or condensation until drying 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:31.810
 full 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.940
 this anti slip paint is fast 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.030
 and easy to apply in one 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.980
 thick and resistant layer its formula 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.660
 very low in solvents and therefore without 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.150
 smell has good resistance 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.750
 chemical and can therefore be used to 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.820
 inside and outside epoxy 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.430
 Maxi flu offers excellent 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.890
 adhesion in areas where the risk of 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.230
 fall and accidents is present its

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.310
 for application at temperatures 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.860
 as low as zero degrees there is 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.200
 epoxy flu maxi cold version and 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.660
