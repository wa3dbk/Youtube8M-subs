00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
the only thing it needs is the timing

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.340 
the only thing it needs is the timing
chain<00:03:26.280> needs<00:03:26.580> to<00:03:26.730> be<00:03:26.790> adjusted<00:03:27.390> which<00:03:28.200> is

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
chain needs to be adjusted which is

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
chain needs to be adjusted which is
going<00:03:28.470> to<00:03:28.530> be<00:03:28.650> my<00:03:28.800> next<00:03:29.010> thing<00:03:29.100> I'm<00:03:29.220> going<00:03:29.310> to

eventually well this one might you can

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.720 
eventually well this one might you can
see<00:04:52.500> the<00:04:52.590> line<00:04:52.800> this<00:04:53.070> one<00:04:53.280> is<00:04:53.430> not<00:04:53.580> so<00:04:53.640> bad<00:04:54.000> ah

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
see the line this one is not so bad ah
