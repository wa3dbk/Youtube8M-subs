00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.670
 bnh and our channel a new era has come 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.650
 we are moving to fifu 15th above me 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.660
 of course finished fourteen boar yes 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.590
 I don’t want to do it at all 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.630
 I will finish it 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.410
 and so I managed to notice right away in 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:22.380
 first matches fifa 15 I already played about 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.539
 ten matches and statistics I just have 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.300
 godly three wins a few draws and 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.279
 11 defeats seems that is to say I don’t 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.529
 I understand this can be won in this 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.020
 the game is simply impossible to score ie in 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.910
 situations where in 14 firms I could be 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.890
 sure that the whole name and flies the gate to 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.530
 this game the ball flies into space such 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.350
 situations but now I'm more or less like 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.379
 accustomed to this game and even it turns out 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.079
 play here I collected the composition of course 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.899
 This composition without Donata I mean it myself 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.320
 saved up his new krishne are expensive 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.850
 but still the key figure in this 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.039
 make up this guy here he is for me 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.469
 just the discovery was that is 10 matches 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.260
 14 swords 3 assists have this beautiful 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.460
 result but i think you can go 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.290
 play our first record match these 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.600
 here we find another opponent 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.400
 idiotic innovation now what 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.049
 no longer have those stripes latin 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.750
 which were previously that we could 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.880
 identify our signal with a rival and 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.549
 at least somehow be sure what will happen 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.380
 We lag soaked there now such 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.090
 there can be no confidence and we fall 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.770
 on super you can make it for now 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.610
 the most powerful part of that with which I 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.650
 played this very strong stick pretty 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.180
 dear at the moment well let's 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.909
 let's start the match I really very much 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.630
 I'm afraid and this match we have among other things for 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.750
 exit in division 9 yes he really does not 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.240
 last course there will still be with us 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:51.299
 opportunities to exit but still one more 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.409
 difference from Feb 14 and if in finance 14 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.049
 very much his whole 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.159
 when a defender with speed is allowed there 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:01.320
 60 chased striker move 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:04.829
 striker soon 190 something in this game already 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.940
 there is no such thing in this game stats speed 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.950
 very much influenced and defender 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.800
 speed of 70 let's say never in my life 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.410
 catch up with attackers in speed let's say 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:19.810
 75 now we can be a dangerous moment 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:22.960
 and 1 strike of the port can be finished but it is a blow 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:26.040
 teach space can escape an hour but already 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:30.400
 sold opens but you can still go 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:34.200
 great pass on you discount well, as so then 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.180
 and the crossbar again yes what is that 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.460
 should have been scoring now I'm telling you 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.870
 it's impossible to score a game 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.660
 I understand what needs to be done to 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.600
 score i did everything for this and this 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.140
 maybe a goal I don't understand what I'm doing 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.720
 not this way 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.180
 my rivals get everything 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.270
 I have nothing like a moment until all 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.880
 no, and here are often moments it's a goal I 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:01.090
 sure no it's not a goal ends 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.220
 we lose the first half by 10 although we could 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.980
 more than once and probably three 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.410
 begins the second again we have there somehow 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.650
 I pass boringly 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:14.260
 even nothing to comment 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.540
 this penalty must be no then free kick 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.430
 in the course of the well will look fine 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.209
 quite dangerous and absolutely able to beat 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.500
 and I here everything is well, I say catch up 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:27.650
 Impossible player will 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.570
 but here we are lucky now 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.350
 a chance to run away and score at last but also so 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.140
 what is 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.710
 it must be red one hundred percent 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:40.450
 exit 11 till it will be a red card 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:43.730
 can already run away quite well 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:47.450
 let's try to get out probably teach 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.459
 break through but what you do can 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.270
 now it will turn out who do not lose 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:55.250
 Gate Well, where do you beat where I do not know 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.280
 how in this game it is impossible to score 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.650
 just make a match after the first three and 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.600
 she called you the worst part of the fifa and then 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.970
 brother took the words back but after that 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:11.020
 there are just such matches at least everything is so 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:12.350
 say i don't understand what i will do wrong 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.350
 I just 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.690
 i don't understand i have to so many times 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:21.079
 was score this 2 rungs per match 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:24.590
 already one on one but no goalkeeper 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:31.220
 will be the first too strong face fuguli 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:34.700
 Well, thank you please at least for this I have 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:37.040
 I deserve this goal I even think that I 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.590
 more than one goal deserved let's 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.479
 see replays in this game which yes 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.630
 they are pretty beautiful in principle their 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:47.479
 only interesting to watch in 1 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.370
 three times maybe 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:51.700
 start to get you more than that 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:57.130
 it was 14 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:57.130
 so teach teach no will not 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:08.110
 a lot of fuguli just one more time goalies 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:11.260
 it was dangerous and I it was dangerous again 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:14.290
 the goalkeeper the goalkeeper and here misses a pair 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.780
 very light swords that is through hands 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.290
 flies through the legs but sometimes such swords 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.450
 drag 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.910
 now was the hotel can counterattack 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.410
 run away and I say I can't catch him 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.120
 that is, it was a hotel and not far away 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.880
 the fastest forward but no one 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:31.720
 can catch up with my team as well 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:34.960
 Well, who does not catch you well at least 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:38.680
 so he has no hit 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:41.500
 let's ok it was useless well all 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.270
 ended the match completely unfair 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.400
 I should have won here I think 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.030
 but I don't know how in this game, but this 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.100
 unreal 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:50.920
 that is, most likely I'm just not used to 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:53.440
 after February 14 and I hope I’m getting used to 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:56.560
 all the same, and I will go a normal game 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:59.110
 but so far so far I have not really 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.970
 like well here's the statistics you yourself 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.370
 see that is to say I have strikes twice 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.210
 more but my players are constantly 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.280
 missed 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:08.650
 let's limit ourselves to one today 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.990
 I will try the match soon 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:14.290
 finish our anapa already finally 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:16.060
