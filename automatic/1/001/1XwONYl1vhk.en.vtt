00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.109 
year old Wheelabrator and it's been
doing<00:01:31.619> this<00:01:31.799> part<00:01:32.420> but<00:01:33.420> I'd<00:01:33.570> like<00:01:33.869> to

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
doing this part but I'd like to

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.640 
doing this part but I'd like to
modernize<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:37.189> do<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.340> faster<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.090> better<00:01:39.240> and

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
these questions which will be the size

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.999 
these questions which will be the size
of<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.850> machine<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.420> he<00:01:51.630> needs<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.710> type<00:01:52.979> of

required what it should look like and we
will<00:01:59.579> help<00:01:59.700> him<00:01:59.790> on<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.360> once<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.399> customer

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
will help him on that once a customer

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.569 
will help him on that once a customer
runs<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:03.090> demonstration<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.290> we<00:02:05.040> sighs<00:02:05.280> him

runs a demonstration and we sighs him

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.180 
runs a demonstration and we sighs him
for<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.790> machine<00:02:06.180> be<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.259> warranty<00:02:08.009> and
