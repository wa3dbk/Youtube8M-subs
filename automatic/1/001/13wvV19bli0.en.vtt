00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.990
 today I will show you how to bake 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.550
 potato potatoes that a horse of 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.110
 kitchen battle 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.110
 certainly not only Italian but 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.939
 international both in restaurants and in 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.930
 family 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.579
 first of all we must boil 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:34.840
 water and let the cubes 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:37.680
 diced potatoes in this medium way 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.680
 size 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:46.809
 so once you cut the potatoes in 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:50.289
 we are going to dip the cubes 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:53.829
 in the water strictly cold because 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:57.070
 then he can make us foam 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:01:00.899
 we turn on at not temperature 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:03.510
 surely very high and leave 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:07.690
 warm water in the meantime 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.790
 let's take our pan thing 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.020
 we want to put extra virgin olive oil 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.369
 olive of rosemary sprigs 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:20.470
 if you want you can put slices 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:24.130
 of garlic if you like and now we wait for that 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:27.490
 potatoes that saga temperature water 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:30.159
 after a few minutes you will notice that 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.549
 this foam is formed is obvious that 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:37.000
 not ever bring to a boil the water is 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:39.700
 immediately remove them otherwise we risk 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.850
 make some boiled potatoes let's put them 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:49.290
 in the pan with extra virgin olive oil 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:49.290
 olive rosemary and garlic to taste 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.400
 in this way 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:58.790
 we go to salt because the water does not go 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:04.460
 never salted before for the blanching 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:10.880
 so we are going to move them and potatoes 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:13.690
 let's make our so-called jump 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:17.210
 potatoes are ready to go into the oven 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:20.030
 let 's put the temperature at 220 240 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:23.780
 degrees for about a quarter of an hour twenty 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.500
 minutes when we see them golden are 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.690
 ready 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.630
 therefore we must not make another that 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.380
 take them out but please 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:37.449
 always eat them very hot 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.449
