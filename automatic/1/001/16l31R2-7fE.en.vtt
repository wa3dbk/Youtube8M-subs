00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
we're seeing the Big Dipper we're seeing

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.410 
we're seeing the Big Dipper we're seeing
Orion<00:00:21.699> we're<00:00:21.910> seeing<00:00:22.090> all<00:00:22.300> the

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
constellations okay now we are millions

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.339 
constellations okay now we are millions
of<00:00:27.699> miles<00:00:27.880> from<00:00:28.210> the<00:00:28.330> Sun<00:00:28.570> and<00:00:28.840> we're<00:00:29.109> facing

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:29.349 
of miles from the Sun and we're facing

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.180 
of miles from the Sun and we're facing
this<00:00:29.619> way<00:00:29.830> right<00:00:30.070> now<00:00:31.529> we<00:00:32.529> go<00:00:32.710> all<00:00:32.950> the<00:00:32.980> way

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
around to the other side of the Sun and

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.780 
around to the other side of the Sun and
we're<00:00:37.030> looking<00:00:37.360> outwards<00:00:38.140> we're<00:00:39.129> still<00:00:39.489> safe

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
we're looking outwards we're still safe

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.780 
we're looking outwards we're still safe
if<00:00:40.690> I'm<00:00:40.840> lying<00:00:41.110> the<00:00:41.680> Big<00:00:41.920> Dipper<00:00:42.160> little

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
if I'm lying the Big Dipper little

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:43.200 
if I'm lying the Big Dipper little
dipper

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
dipper

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.240 
dipper
we're<00:00:43.930> seeing<00:00:44.170> all<00:00:44.320> the<00:00:44.440> same<00:00:44.649> constellations

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
we're seeing all the same constellations

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.160 
we're seeing all the same constellations
we<00:00:48.250> should<00:00:48.370> be<00:00:48.460> seeing<00:00:48.760> new<00:00:49.270> constellations

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
we should be seeing new constellations

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.950 
we should be seeing new constellations
as<00:00:50.469> we're<00:00:50.680> moving<00:00:51.039> around<00:00:51.309> the<00:00:51.640> Sun<00:00:51.899> why<00:00:52.899> are

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
as we're moving around the Sun why are

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.479 
as we're moving around the Sun why are
we<00:00:53.140> not<00:00:53.289> seeing<00:00:53.530> the<00:00:53.710> constellations<00:00:54.399> it's

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
we not seeing the constellations it's

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.760 
we not seeing the constellations it's
the<00:00:54.579> same<00:00:54.789> thing<00:00:55.030> is<00:00:55.180> from<00:00:55.360> over<00:00:55.690> here<00:00:55.930> we're

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:56.770 
the same thing is from over here we're

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.729 
the same thing is from over here we're
facing<00:00:57.100> in<00:00:57.340> a<00:00:57.430> completely<00:00:57.879> new<00:00:58.180> direction

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
facing in a completely new direction

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.069 
facing in a completely new direction
why<00:00:59.739> are<00:01:00.160> you<00:01:00.489> see<00:01:00.820> different<00:01:01.690> constellations

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079 
why are you see different constellations

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.380 
why are you see different constellations
as<00:01:02.640> we<00:01:03.640> are<00:01:03.789> going<00:01:03.969> around<00:01:04.210> the<00:01:04.540> Sun<00:01:06.390> does

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
as we are going around the Sun does

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.660 
as we are going around the Sun does
anybody<00:01:07.600> have<00:01:07.930> an<00:01:08.080> answer<00:01:08.200> for<00:01:08.380> that<00:01:08.530> and<00:01:09.130> I

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
anybody have an answer for that and I

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.179 
anybody have an answer for that and I
know<00:01:09.729> everything<00:01:10.270> that's<00:01:10.540> moving<00:01:10.780> around<00:01:11.729> so

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
know everything that's moving around so

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.490 
know everything that's moving around so
everybody<00:01:15.189> we<00:01:15.820> look<00:01:16.270> out<00:01:16.509> we<00:01:17.110> should<00:01:17.170> see<00:01:17.470> a

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
everybody we look out we should see a

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.170 
everybody we look out we should see a
different<00:01:17.890> constellation<00:01:18.549> a<00:01:18.640> different<00:01:18.970> part

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
different constellation a different part

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.560 
different constellation a different part
of<00:01:19.210> the<00:01:19.360> sky<00:01:20.430> now<00:01:21.430> reasonably<00:01:22.119> the<00:01:22.210> only<00:01:22.420> thing

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
of the sky now reasonably the only thing

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.120 
of the sky now reasonably the only thing
you<00:01:22.659> can<00:01:22.840> think<00:01:22.869> of<00:01:23.170> is<00:01:23.350> that<00:01:23.380> the<00:01:23.830> earth<00:01:24.009> is

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
you can think of is that the earth is

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.580 
you can think of is that the earth is
staying<00:01:24.820> the<00:01:25.180> same<00:01:25.210> in<00:01:25.780> relation<00:01:26.229> to<00:01:26.259> the<00:01:26.380> Sun

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
staying the same in relation to the Sun

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.109 
staying the same in relation to the Sun
and<00:01:26.890> you're<00:01:27.040> spending<00:01:27.280> every<00:01:27.610> night<00:01:27.790> I<00:01:27.939> know

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
and you're spending every night I know

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.330 
and you're spending every night I know
that's<00:01:28.390> probably<00:01:28.570> not<00:01:28.840> true<00:01:29.220> but<00:01:30.220> that

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
that's probably not true but that

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.819 
that's probably not true but that
explains<00:01:30.670> why<00:01:31.030> every<00:01:31.810> single<00:01:31.840> night<00:01:32.290> of<00:01:32.619> the

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:32.829 
explains why every single night of the

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:35.429 
explains why every single night of the
year<00:01:33.180> with<00:01:34.180> some<00:01:34.420> slight<00:01:34.689> variations<00:01:35.229> when

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
year with some slight variations when

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:37.920 
year with some slight variations when
the<00:01:35.530> earth<00:01:35.680> tilts<00:01:36.100> the<00:01:36.729> seasons<00:01:37.210> we<00:01:37.540> see<00:01:37.720> some

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
the earth tilts the seasons we see some

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.330 
the earth tilts the seasons we see some
different<00:01:38.259> constellations<00:01:38.619> but<00:01:39.100> only<00:01:39.220> a

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
different constellations but only a

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.100 
different constellations but only a
little<00:01:39.549> bit<00:01:39.700> but<00:01:40.150> not<00:01:40.299> completely<00:01:40.810> different

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
little bit but not completely different

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.940 
little bit but not completely different
constellations<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:43.210> if<00:01:43.720> you<00:01:44.200> know<00:01:44.439> why<00:01:44.890> this

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
constellations so if you know why this

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.850 
constellations so if you know why this
weathers<00:01:45.880> happens<00:01:46.329> and<00:01:46.930> why<00:01:47.110> we<00:01:47.680> see

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
weathers happens and why we see

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.590 
weathers happens and why we see
constantly<00:01:48.340> see<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.640> same<00:01:48.850> constellations

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
constantly see the same constellations

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.830 
constantly see the same constellations
even<00:01:50.320> though<00:01:50.409> everything<00:01:51.070> is<00:01:51.159> moving<00:01:51.520> around

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
even though everything is moving around

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.870 
even though everything is moving around
