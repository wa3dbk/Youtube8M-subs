hey guys it's grant Allen coming at ya
again<00:00:03.000> with<00:00:03.240> just<00:00:03.570> a<00:00:03.689> pretty<00:00:04.500> simple<00:00:04.980> program

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
again with just a pretty simple program

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.760 
again with just a pretty simple program
here<00:00:05.430> which<00:00:06.319> doesn't<00:00:07.319> take<00:00:07.560> much<00:00:07.740> effort

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
here which doesn't take much effort

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.600 
here which doesn't take much effort
let's<00:00:08.280> break<00:00:08.490> ooh<00:00:08.730> so<00:00:09.420> I<00:00:09.710> a<00:00:10.710> fuse<00:00:11.250> could<00:00:11.400> turn

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
let's break ooh so I a fuse could turn

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.249 
let's break ooh so I a fuse could turn
into<00:00:11.849> whatever<00:00:12.150> you<00:00:12.360> want<00:00:12.540> just<00:00:12.719> by<00:00:13.080> using

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
into whatever you want just by using

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.189 
into whatever you want just by using
this<00:00:13.500> bad<00:00:13.710> code<00:00:13.950> that<00:00:14.450> yeah<00:00:15.450> any<00:00:15.690> of<00:00:16.020> our

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
this bad code that yeah any of our

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.380 
this bad code that yeah any of our
programs<00:00:16.650> that<00:00:17.130> you've<00:00:17.430> watched<00:00:17.880> before<00:00:18.060> you

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
programs that you've watched before you

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.640 
programs that you've watched before you
can<00:00:18.539> actually<00:00:18.690> incorporate<00:00:19.080> in<00:00:19.529> other

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
can actually incorporate in other

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.620 
can actually incorporate in other
programs<00:00:20.160> or<00:00:20.400> I'd<00:00:20.609> bet<00:00:20.939> saying<00:00:21.180> if<00:00:21.270> you<00:00:21.390> really

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
programs or I'd bet saying if you really

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.710 
programs or I'd bet saying if you really
want<00:00:22.789> the<00:00:23.789> more<00:00:23.939> you<00:00:24.029> do<00:00:24.180> them<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.420> more

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
want the more you do them the more

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.750 
want the more you do them the more
you'll<00:00:24.869> realize<00:00:25.170> how<00:00:25.199> easy<00:00:25.470> that's<00:00:26.400> the

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
you'll realize how easy that's the

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.580 
you'll realize how easy that's the
program<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.180> special<00:00:27.869> Basic<00:00:28.170> Express<00:00:29.330> okay<00:00:30.590> so

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
program a special Basic Express okay so

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.729 
program a special Basic Express okay so
we<00:00:32.520> have<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.940> button<00:00:33.180> on<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.750> progress<00:00:33.899> bar<00:00:34.230> and

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
we have a button on the progress bar and

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.330 
we have a button on the progress bar and
a<00:00:35.040> timer<00:00:35.600> progress<00:00:36.600> bar<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:37.079> called<00:00:37.530> progress

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
a timer progress bar is called progress

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
a timer progress bar is called progress
bar<00:00:38.700> one<00:00:38.910> timer<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:39.899> called<00:00:40.140> paper<00:00:40.680> one<00:00:41.360> button

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
bar one timer is called paper one button

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.529 
bar one timer is called paper one button
this<00:00:42.989> button<00:00:43.200> what<00:00:43.730> buttons<00:00:44.730> called<00:00:45.000> disabled

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
this button what buttons called disabled

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.060 
this button what buttons called disabled
I'm<00:00:46.050> just<00:00:46.230> gonna<00:00:46.320> run<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:46.680> through<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:47.010> one

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
I'm just gonna run you through this one

saw the one so we'll just jump straight
into<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.890> code<00:00:55.890> here<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.430> code<00:00:56.730> can<00:00:57.360> be<00:00:57.390> a

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
into the code here the code can be a

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.599 
into the code here the code can be a
little<00:00:57.719> complicated<00:00:58.050> but<00:00:58.500> it's<00:00:58.829> not<00:00:59.039> really

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
little complicated but it's not really

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.030

I<00:02:28.320> said<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.650> do<00:02:28.880> three<00:02:30.140> sets<00:02:31.140> fair<00:02:31.410> enough

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
I said to do three sets fair enough

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.410 
I said to do three sets fair enough
okay<00:02:32.340> um<00:02:32.580> s<00:02:33.950> left<00:02:34.950> my<00:02:35.190> dear<00:02:35.430> F<00:02:35.610> progress<00:02:36.210> bar

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
okay um s left my dear F progress bar

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.110 
okay um s left my dear F progress bar
one<00:02:36.660> dark<00:02:37.140> value<00:02:37.590> equals<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.190> hundred<00:02:38.610> then

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
one dark value equals a hundred then

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.040 
one dark value equals a hundred then
timer<00:02:39.630> one<00:02:39.870> dot<00:02:40.350> a<00:02:40.380> near<00:02:40.620> booth<00:02:40.830> equals<00:02:41.220> false

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
timer one dot a near booth equals false

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.360 
timer one dot a near booth equals false
okay<00:02:43.250> now<00:02:44.250> block<00:02:44.850> and<00:02:45.120> put<00:02:45.390> false<00:02:46.170> so<00:02:47.070> you<00:02:47.160> can

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
okay now block and put false so you can

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.760 
okay now block and put false so you can
now<00:02:47.520> use<00:02:47.790> message<00:02:48.330> box<00:02:48.600> comes<00:02:48.930> up<00:02:49.110> you<00:02:49.500> can<00:02:49.560> no

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
now use message box comes up you can no

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.820 
now use message box comes up you can no
use<00:02:49.980> your<00:02:50.100> mouse<00:02:50.310> and<00:02:50.580> keyboard<00:02:50.790> again<00:02:51.440> and<00:02:52.440> at

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
use your mouse and keyboard again and at

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.670 
use your mouse and keyboard again and at
the<00:02:53.010> end<00:02:53.130> of<00:02:53.220> that<00:02:53.370> progress<00:02:54.030> bar<00:02:54.150> one<00:02:55.110> dot

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
the end of that progress bar one dot

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.470 
the end of that progress bar one dot
value<00:02:56.130> equals<00:02:56.820> zero<00:02:57.330> and<00:02:57.720> then<00:02:59.480> there's

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
value equals zero and then there's

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.850 
value equals zero and then there's
nothing<00:03:00.660> else<00:03:00.900> in<00:03:01.110> our<00:03:01.260> program<00:03:01.650> obviously

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
nothing else in our program obviously

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.160 
nothing else in our program obviously
you're<00:03:02.280> in<00:03:02.400> solving<00:03:02.760> your<00:03:02.820> own<00:03:02.910> class<00:03:03.180> and<00:03:03.480> it

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
you're in solving your own class and it

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.520 
you're in solving your own class and it
does<00:03:04.440> exactly<00:03:04.740> what<00:03:04.920> it<00:03:05.130> says<00:03:05.160> on<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.520> box

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
does exactly what it says on the box

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.940 
does exactly what it says on the box
so<00:03:07.530> well<00:03:07.980> write<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.580> program<00:03:08.970> and<00:03:09.680> you'll<00:03:10.680> see

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
so well write the program and you'll see

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.040 
so well write the program and you'll see
what<00:03:11.220> is<00:03:12.800> disabled<00:03:14.150> and<00:03:15.150> I<00:03:15.300> can't<00:03:15.600> use<00:03:15.810> my

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
what is disabled and I can't use my

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.720 
what is disabled and I can't use my
mouse<00:03:16.200> here<00:03:17.120> can't<00:03:18.120> use<00:03:18.300> that<00:03:18.450> all<00:03:18.660> no<00:03:19.050> again

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
mouse here can't use that all no again

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.620 
mouse here can't use that all no again
okay<00:03:20.730> now<00:03:21.030> you<00:03:21.090> can<00:03:21.240> hear<00:03:21.540> this<00:03:23.180> and<00:03:24.180> that

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
okay now you can hear this and that

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.530 
okay now you can hear this and that
won't<00:03:24.810> work<00:03:24.990> okay<00:03:25.500> so<00:03:25.850> all<00:03:26.850> that<00:03:27.030> does<00:03:27.240> is<00:03:27.420> it

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
won't work okay so all that does is it

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.110 
won't work okay so all that does is it
disables<00:03:27.990> your<00:03:28.110> mouse<00:03:28.260> and<00:03:28.440> keyboard<00:03:29.120> nothing

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
disables your mouse and keyboard nothing

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.370 
disables your mouse and keyboard nothing
really<00:03:30.300> special<00:03:30.690> well<00:03:31.050> you<00:03:31.140> could<00:03:31.290> probably

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
really special well you could probably

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.110 
really special well you could probably
incorporate<00:03:31.860> that<00:03:32.280> into<00:03:32.460> your<00:03:32.790> program<00:03:33.270> and

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
incorporate that into your program and

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.640 
incorporate that into your program and
it<00:03:36.120> may<00:03:36.720> do<00:03:36.900> you<00:03:37.020> some<00:03:37.170> good

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
it may do you some good

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.670 
it may do you some good
you<00:03:38.100> never<00:03:38.250> home<00:03:38.630> okay<00:03:39.630> off<00:03:39.840> I<00:03:40.110> shall<00:03:40.500> learn

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
you never home okay off I shall learn

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.840 
you never home okay off I shall learn
that<00:03:40.980> off<00:03:41.250> our<00:03:42.680> other<00:03:43.680> video<00:03:44.130> and<00:03:44.310> YouTube<00:03:44.670> but

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
that off our other video and YouTube but

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.910 
that off our other video and YouTube but
hopefully<00:03:45.660> I've<00:03:45.930> talked<00:03:46.350> you<00:03:46.530> through<00:03:46.590> this<00:03:46.860> a

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
hopefully I've talked you through this a

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.180 
hopefully I've talked you through this a
little<00:03:47.160> better<00:03:47.370> than<00:03:47.700> no<00:03:48.420> if<00:03:48.600> I<00:03:48.690> do<00:03:48.750> that

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
little better than no if I do that

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.800 
little better than no if I do that
so<00:03:50.550> I<00:03:50.790> suppose<00:03:51.030> you<00:03:51.150> could<00:03:51.330> see<00:03:51.540> that<00:03:51.660> I<00:03:51.720> was

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
so I suppose you could see that I was

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.250 
so I suppose you could see that I was
still<00:03:52.110> gonna<00:03:52.230> be<00:03:52.380> better<00:03:52.560> code<00:03:52.800> there<00:03:53.040> but<00:03:54.260> I'm

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
still gonna be better code there but I'm

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.380 
still gonna be better code there but I'm
sure<00:03:55.440> the<00:03:55.560> guy<00:03:55.680> won't<00:03:55.860> mean<00:03:56.150> don't<00:03:57.150> know<00:03:57.209> who

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
sure the guy won't mean don't know who

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.720 
sure the guy won't mean don't know who
he<00:03:57.450> is<00:03:57.570> there's<00:03:58.440> also<00:03:58.650> an<00:03:58.980> old<00:03:59.130> guy<00:03:59.370> who<00:03:59.430> makes

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
he is there's also an old guy who makes

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.110 
he is there's also an old guy who makes

most<00:04:07.170> of<00:04:07.350> my<00:04:07.470> code<00:04:07.680> from<00:04:07.920> but<00:04:08.130> he<00:04:08.880> is<00:04:09.030> foreign

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
most of my code from but he is foreign

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.100 
most of my code from but he is foreign
well<00:04:10.290> see<00:04:10.980> far<00:04:11.250> enough<00:04:11.400> is<00:04:11.790> it<00:04:12.209> is<00:04:12.450> not<00:04:12.630> an
