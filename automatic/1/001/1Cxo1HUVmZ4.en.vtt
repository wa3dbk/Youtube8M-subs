00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:21.120
 originals of these are from the aliens 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:21.120
 that scanned in the chapter of 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:28.029
 good is that it was in the chapter where 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:30.430
 the mummy comes out and this one of víctor does not 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:33.430
 I remember the solid chapter 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:36.579
 obviously when it came out, but not 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:39.030
 remember which one come out in the 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:44.000
 chapter where 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.000
 where phantom drug returns 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:51.890
 how will they know they are ben 10 alien force 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:54.300
 but they show only the characters of 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.800
 I sold is the original series so 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.800
 it is practically sold 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.810
 let's go with the mummy 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:10.190
 in the detail on the face are very 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.720
 well the eyes are green you have all 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.350
 thing that would be like hair 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:19.220
 of one of the Egyptians in detail of the 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:21.090
 bandages on nitrites 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.549
 the least 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.830
 have these that would come from being sales 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:31.020
 they hang their legs and feet 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:34.260
 Suggestive joints and 730 degrees 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.770
 the arms rotate 360 ​​degrees and your waist 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:40.259
 turn 160 degrees but it's a little link 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.480
 it is not limited only that they get in the way 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.280
 little sales 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.570
 and this 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:51.710
 we have convicts the arms rotate 360 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.710
 degrees his head rotates 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:02:00.090
 360 degrees has these things that is 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.460
 where energy is removed they are connected 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.789
 here but you are left with a lot 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.840
 ease so it's good to stick those 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.840
 with a tape 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:17.400
 good your waist rotates 360 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:20.880
 the victory detail very well these 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:24.290
 things where cables were connected this is 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.290
 as a frankenstein 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:32.210
 now let's go with the good of these 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:37.480
 figures that is to transform it 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:42.280
 in this beast that looks like a 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:46.090
 I am reminded of the 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:49.350
 the assistants of the joke when they are 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.120
 injects titans in 'batman arkham asylum 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.410
 if they have played batman arkham asylum and not 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.500
 you know what I'm talking about that has an arm 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.330
 super super strong and the other is very 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.020
 weak I do not know I figure this 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.020
 good 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:10.220
 and we started by removing this 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.680
 Y 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:17.069
 We take out all the pieces and we 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:22.569
 we remove this he uses as the feet good 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:25.970
 we put the legs of the mummy 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:28.390
 the head of the mummy 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.390
 Y 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:36.570
 the mummy's arm good here says that 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:39.000
 we must arm the arm 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.620
 left but I'm not going to put this on 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.240
 because if you look here you have the 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.130
 omnitrix and here also has the 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.320
 omnitrix so the other figure is not going 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.920
 to be with none mix and I that's why I 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.920
 I will put this 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.209
 if you should stay here as you can see 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.370
 it's the other arm but I told you because 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.370
 just cannes and we put them 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.480
 the part where I draw in habit habit 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.050
 we put a lake 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.850
 and they went with the remains we formed the other 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.850
 figure 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.500
 it looks a bit silly since the head looks 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:31.790
 very rude and 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.790
 and with that purpose 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:46.420
 these I bought what I really like 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:49.970
 these characters but to have the 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:51.880
 fantasy army because I have to 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.960
 fantasmatic 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:59.080
 of the wolf since he came with wilde in that 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.460
 It was a Christmas gift wild one and even 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.200
 wolf and I wanted that package 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.990
 mainly power man and as it comes 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:08.080
 that's good so buy this for 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.760
 have the army good is not so much a 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.360
 army rather the assistants of 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.729
 ghost 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.210
 well this has been everything and this is the 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:16.210
 next
