00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.710
 to equip your house and that for this 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:21.990
 need and so here we come to our 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:24.689
 the ground and visible drawing table chest fruit 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.000
 whose workbench and anvil is our home 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:31.949
 will be located here on this one 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.420
 site so open the chest and see 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.980
 what is in it 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:44.800
 30 clay 30 stone 6 6 iron bars and 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:49.540
 one corundum sledak we take it all so 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:53.730
 there is another way with code but telling 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.730
 I will not mind and so 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.890
 if you run out of stone you can 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.600
 go to this one quarry here to take 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.400
 pick it here again for next Lyada 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:08.790
 lies and try to get a stone 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:11.550
 here we mine stone stones and clay to us 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:16.860
 will need quite a lot and also about 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:19.890
 200 iron bars to build a total 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.700
 home from start to finish here here 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.430
 here we have a tool and here we are 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.369
 I can add clay for a long time 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.000
 looking for where to get the clay but then by chance 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.340
 found and here i am telling you 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.700
 damn we got here and so 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:43.490
 to start building we need to come up in 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:46.410
 drawing table and choose construction 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:51.509
 small house planning small house 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:53.260
 ask for one more thing to start 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.710
 build 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:59.650
 we need wood timber you 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.050
 can buy anywhere that is 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:06.580
 can be bought at a sawmill can be bought from 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:09.160
 ordinary merchants I buy from residents 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.830
 sawmills so let's say here is most convenient 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:16.300
 how do you live there vampire 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:19.750
 and here I buy 20 wood for 200 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:23.830
 gold in principle to build a house 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:27.340
 it took me about 200 wood may even 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.500
 be a little less so for building 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.040
 the whole house will take no more than ten 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:37.170
 thousand not counting furniture and not even not 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.670
 more than 5 thousand well, plus furniture 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:45.070
 again these long downloads 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:47.380
 how they annoy me and so now we 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:52.270
 load buy wood and get started 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:56.760
 the construction is not exactly complete construction and I 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.760
 I'll show you just so it all looks 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.750
 so 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.140
 so we arrived at the sawmill and 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.590
 it seems we have a speed vampire because us 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.210
 how now those 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.210
 let's wait for the evening 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:25.640
 strange people like country vampires 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:25.640
 work in the evening they sleep in the afternoon and so 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:34.640
 that you they do not watch these women 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.010
 so here we go 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:45.510
 Choose a tab I want to buy 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:47.780
 wood and buy as much as you 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.780
 need to 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:57.500
 Here I bought some wood to us already 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:04:00.740
 delivered to the place of construction and we arrive 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.740
 start building 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.220
 I do not understand why such downloads 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:30.940
 maybe it's because of fraps but because 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:34.740
 during the game it loads of course too 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.740
 debt but not for as long as now 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.330
 and so here we are 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:05:01.630
 we have wood lying around here 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:06.760
 you see her hope now you come 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:09.010
 to the workbench and after choosing the building 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.050
 rumor house and us in tab appears 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:15.700
 these are the things 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:17.890
 that is, we can lay the foundation for 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:20.800
 frame walls we need nails 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:24.790
 nails you can do in the anvil 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:28.210
 in the tab materials also here you 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:36.730
 can make iron door parts 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:40.550
 hinges and a lock and so here in a fit yet 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:46.390
 times and built the frame walls 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:52.990
 now the walls of the roof frame floor and roof 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:55.700
 now we have to build a door that 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:58.450
 do with the help of the anvil us 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:04.180
 need a door hinge 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:10.690
 iron parts and lock that's all now 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:10.690
 we come again and make the door 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.389
 that's the whole 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:19.060
 small house we have built further you can 

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:21.520
 choose an extension 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:24.120
 As a big house, various
