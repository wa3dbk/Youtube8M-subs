00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.400 
you actually said it it just it's a
stable<00:01:47.910> picture<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.450> does<00:01:48.630> not<00:01:48.780> move<00:01:49.140> or

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
stable picture it does not move or

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.110 
stable picture it does not move or
anything<00:01:49.710> but<00:01:50.190> it<00:01:50.310> does<00:01:50.490> have<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.760> nice<00:01:50.940> little

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
anything but it does have a nice little

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.510 
anything but it does have a nice little
background<00:01:51.630> feature<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.680> again<00:01:53.400> you

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
background feature to it and again you

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.950 
background feature to it and again you
could<00:01:53.640> do<00:01:53.760> this<00:01:53.910> also<00:01:54.120> with<00:01:54.300> your<00:01:54.570> gallery

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
could do this also with your gallery

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.870 
could do this also with your gallery
which<00:01:55.260> would<00:01:55.410> be<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.980> photos<00:01:56.400> that<00:01:56.430> are<00:01:56.730> on

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
which would be the photos that are on

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.920 
which would be the photos that are on
the<00:01:57.060> phone<00:01:57.240> itself<00:01:58.850> now<00:01:59.850> another<00:02:00.450> thing<00:02:00.600> that

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
the phone itself now another thing that

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.870 
the phone itself now another thing that
we<00:02:00.960> have<00:02:01.080> here<00:02:01.440> for<00:02:01.740> next<00:02:01.950> we<00:02:02.310> actually<00:02:02.700> want

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
we have here for next we actually want

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.040 
we have here for next we actually want
to<00:02:03.000> limit<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.360> background<00:02:03.750> data

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
to limit the background data

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.350 
to limit the background data
synchronization<00:02:05.040> by<00:02:05.670> default<00:02:06.030> this<00:02:06.300> is

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
synchronization by default this is

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.270
