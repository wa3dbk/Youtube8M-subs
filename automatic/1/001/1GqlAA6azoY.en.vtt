pop it how do you go about transferring
data<00:03:26.940> from<00:03:27.240> existing<00:03:27.720> xbox<00:03:28.350> so<00:03:28.650> if<00:03:28.710> you<00:03:28.800> have

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
data from existing xbox so if you have

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.940 
data from existing xbox so if you have
an<00:03:28.980> existing<00:03:29.070> console<00:03:29.810> it's<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.990> same<00:03:31.230> data

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
an existing console it's the same data

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.170 
an existing console it's the same data
transfer<00:03:32.340> process<00:03:32.700> that<00:03:32.820> we<00:03:32.910> have<00:03:33.030> today

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
transfer process that we have today

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.300 
transfer process that we have today
actually<00:03:33.420> so<00:03:33.870> you<00:03:34.530> can<00:03:34.680> use<00:03:34.860> the<00:03:35.070> data

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
actually so you can use the data

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.090 
actually so you can use the data
transfer<00:03:35.760> game<00:03:35.970> which<00:03:36.750> we<00:03:37.020> are<00:03:37.380> actually

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
transfer game which we are actually

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.070 
transfer game which we are actually
going<00:03:38.340> to<00:03:38.430> make<00:03:38.580> a<00:03:38.610> retail<00:03:39.120> product<00:03:39.510> so<00:03:39.990> you

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
going to make a retail product so you

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.700 
going to make a retail product so you
can<00:03:40.230> now<00:03:40.320> buy<00:03:40.710> that<00:03:40.920> for<00:03:41.070> 1995<00:03:41.640> in<00:03:42.570> the<00:03:42.720> US<00:03:42.990> you

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:43.710 
can now buy that for 1995 in the US you

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.040 
can now buy that for 1995 in the US you
can<00:03:43.830> also<00:03:43.950> do<00:03:44.190> transfer<00:03:45.150> via<00:03:45.300> USB<00:03:45.540> thumb<00:03:45.840> drive

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
can also do transfer via USB thumb drive

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.200 
can also do transfer via USB thumb drive
so<00:03:46.440> we<00:03:46.680> enabled<00:03:47.040> that<00:03:47.190> you<00:03:47.760> know<00:03:47.850> a<00:03:47.880> month<00:03:48.060> or

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.210 
so we enabled that you know a month or

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.990 
so we enabled that you know a month or
so<00:03:48.330> ago<00:03:48.650> you<00:03:49.650> can<00:03:49.800> take<00:03:50.010> you<00:03:50.280> know<00:03:50.310> just<00:03:50.670> up<00:03:50.850> to

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
so ago you can take you know just up to

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.690 
so ago you can take you know just up to
16<00:03:51.360> gigs<00:03:51.570> a<00:03:51.690> day<00:03:51.810> that<00:03:51.960> hood<00:03:52.140> over<00:03:52.380> USB<00:03:52.620> or<00:03:53.580> you

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
16 gigs a day that hood over USB or you

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.570 
16 gigs a day that hood over USB or you
can<00:03:53.850> do<00:03:54.030> auto<00:03:54.390> download<00:03:54.660> via<00:03:55.200> Xbox<00:03:55.620> Live<00:03:55.830> so

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
can do auto download via Xbox Live so

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
downloaded you can redownload that to

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.530 
downloaded you can redownload that to
any<00:04:01.380> console<00:04:01.770> are<00:04:02.190> there<00:04:02.400> any<00:04:02.700> like<00:04:03.030> speed

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
any console are there any like speed

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.990 
any console are there any like speed
changes<00:04:04.320> to<00:04:04.560> the<00:04:04.680> drive<00:04:04.950> is<00:04:05.160> just<00:04:05.489> larger

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
changes to the drive is just larger

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.670 
changes to the drive is just larger
there<00:04:06.300> any<00:04:06.450> optimizations<00:04:07.170> you<00:04:07.290> guys<00:04:07.500> have

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
there any optimizations you guys have

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.180 
there any optimizations you guys have
done<00:04:07.860> as<00:04:08.130> far<00:04:08.340> as<00:04:08.580> hard<00:04:09.590> for<00:04:10.590> you<00:04:10.650> that<00:04:11.010> might

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
done as far as hard for you that might

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.949 
done as far as hard for you that might
actually<00:04:11.340> improve<00:04:11.850> my<00:04:12.030> game<00:04:12.090> mo<00:04:12.450> times<00:04:12.720> right

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
actually improve my game mo times right

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.900 
actually improve my game mo times right
now<00:04:13.440> so<00:04:13.680> performance<00:04:14.340> you<00:04:14.520> know<00:04:14.580> the<00:04:14.670> drives

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
now so performance you know the drives

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:15.830 
now so performance you know the drives
are<00:04:15.030> always<00:04:15.209> going<00:04:15.300> to<00:04:15.390> be<00:04:15.420> going<00:04:15.630> up<00:04:15.720> in

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
are always going to be going up in

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.570 
are always going to be going up in
performance<00:04:16.320> but<00:04:16.919> there<00:04:17.070> wasn't<00:04:17.220> you<00:04:17.520> know

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
performance but there wasn't you know

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.250 
performance but there wasn't you know
there's<00:04:17.880> there's<00:04:18.150> always<00:04:18.480> optimization<00:04:19.109> but

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
there's there's always optimization but

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.930 
there's there's always optimization but
nothing<00:04:19.530> specific<00:04:19.799> you<00:04:20.070> it's<00:04:20.190> not<00:04:20.340> twice<00:04:20.760> as

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
nothing specific you it's not twice as

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.409 
nothing specific you it's not twice as
fast<00:04:21.120> or<00:04:21.359> anything<00:04:22.669> let's<00:04:23.669> get<00:04:23.910> back<00:04:24.090> to<00:04:24.270> the

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
fast or anything let's get back to the

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.530 
fast or anything let's get back to the
power<00:04:24.870> brick<00:04:25.110> here<00:04:25.910> which<00:04:26.910> is<00:04:27.090> quite<00:04:27.270> light

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
power brick here which is quite light

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.200 
power brick here which is quite light
now<00:04:27.750> compared<00:04:28.140> to<00:04:28.260> the<00:04:28.380> original<00:04:29.280> one<00:04:29.760> but<00:04:29.940> I'm

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
now compared to the original one but I'm

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.380 
now compared to the original one but I'm
not<00:04:30.480> really<00:04:30.660> that<00:04:30.840> much<00:04:30.900> smaller<00:04:32.270> still<00:04:33.270> the

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
not really that much smaller still the

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:42.719 
not really that much smaller still the
lights<00:04:33.630> here<00:04:33.840> on<00:04:33.990> this<00:04:34.080> side

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:49.600 

cos<00:04:43.729> we<00:04:43.879> have<00:04:44.030> power<00:04:44.870> cable<00:04:47.440> here<00:04:48.440> is<00:04:48.740> the<00:04:49.099> AV

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
cos we have power cable here is the AV

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.330 
cos we have power cable here is the AV
adapter<00:04:50.270> and<00:04:50.509> I'm<00:04:50.690> not<00:04:50.870> seeing<00:04:51.319> anything<00:04:51.560> XP

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
adapter and I'm not seeing anything XP

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.149 
adapter and I'm not seeing anything XP
this<00:04:52.729> is<00:04:52.970> composite<00:04:53.629> so<00:04:53.900> we've<00:04:54.199> got<00:04:54.379> standard

00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:55.159 
this is composite so we've got standard

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:59.080 
this is composite so we've got standard
