I decided to use a piece of t-shirt
instead<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.640> yarn<00:00:38.879> because<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.390> read<00:00:39.540> that

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
instead of yarn because I read that

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.840 
instead of yarn because I read that
cotton<00:00:40.079> works<00:00:40.290> better<00:00:40.530> this<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:41.340> cotton<00:00:41.550> and

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850
