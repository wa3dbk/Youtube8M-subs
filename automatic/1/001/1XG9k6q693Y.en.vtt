00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:44.300

that's why I get to go so now I'm gonna

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.290 
that's why I get to go so now I'm gonna
shut<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.019> down

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:17.660 

wait<00:01:00.300> for<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.570> hard<00:01:00.750> drive<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.170> stop<00:01:01.409> running

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.170 

I'm<00:01:18.180> going<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.420> go<00:01:18.509> right<00:01:18.720> into<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.140> BIOS<00:01:19.560> to

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
I'm going to go right into the BIOS to

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:29.039 
I'm going to go right into the BIOS to
see<00:01:21.180> if<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.420> Nvidia<00:01:21.810> strike<00:01:22.080> even<00:01:22.380> shows<00:01:22.619> up

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:31.020 

it's<00:01:29.619> looking<00:01:29.950> like<00:01:29.979> it<00:01:30.189> will<00:01:30.310> this<00:01:30.490> time<00:01:30.729> but

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
it's looking like it will this time but

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:39.770 
it's looking like it will this time but
we'll<00:01:31.149> go<00:01:31.299> into<00:01:31.420> the<00:01:31.509> BIOS<00:01:31.810> anyway

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.060 

goody<00:01:40.440> strike<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.980> we're<00:01:41.430> missing<00:01:41.790> one<00:01:41.940> of<00:01:41.970> my

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
goody strike and we're missing one of my

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.950 
goody strike and we're missing one of my
features<00:01:44.070> but<00:01:44.310> that's<00:01:44.490> okay<00:01:45.020> little<00:01:46.020> exit

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
features but that's okay little exit

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:56.859 
features but that's okay little exit
okay<00:01:49.040> and<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.520> should<00:01:50.700> start<00:01:50.970> up<00:01:51.120> yes<00:01:51.420> why

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:58.929 

even<00:01:57.530> if<00:01:57.619> I<00:01:57.740> didn't<00:01:58.009> enter<00:01:58.159> the<00:01:58.340> BIOS<00:01:58.640> it<00:01:58.850> would

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
even if I didn't enter the BIOS it would

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.039 
even if I didn't enter the BIOS it would
have<00:01:59.030> started<00:01:59.210> up<00:01:59.420> mine<00:02:01.600> he<00:02:02.600> does<00:02:02.810> that<00:02:02.990> every

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
have started up mine he does that every

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.279 
have started up mine he does that every
time<00:02:03.530> it<00:02:03.860> sits<00:02:04.579> overnight<00:02:04.909> or<00:02:05.360> for<00:02:05.930> a<00:02:05.960> period

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289
