00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
 hi it's marco dr von today 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.520
 is found for a video of 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.589
 presentation more from the angle of 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.019
 information only from the angle of testing 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.400
 technique strictly speaking it is 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.710
 so video presentation of a 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.529
 microsd card of sandisk brand 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.869
 sandisk a world famous brand 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.880
 are the leader of the solution of 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.039
 storage in any case in terms of cards 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.800
 so this is the brand card 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.789
 sandisk sandisk ultra micro sd xc eu hs1 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.920
 that you understood it is a map 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.059
 micro sd to be simpler but what 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.550
 which makes it special is that it 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.469
 This is the first micro SD card 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.129
 manufactures and markets and to the world 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.399
 with a capacity of 2,100 gigabits 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.539
 so we are on a micro SD card 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.050
 monstrous in terms of ability to 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.910
 storage 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.320
 we are still at the limit 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.110
 can read like that from a hard drive ssd 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.620
 for example so we are on 2 100 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.090
 gigabits of storage so in terms of 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.620
 gigabyte when we do small 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.309
 conversion and that especially in tests 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.090
 in real conditions 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.890
 is 183 giga byte spaces 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.479
 available on this micro sd it's 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.740
 just colossal that you have it well 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.960
 understood so a huge 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.450
 I insist on that micro sd card 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.299
 well above the 128 that we 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.150
 could have seen him appear recently 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:20.939
 a micro SD card that speaks the size 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.450
 its size its capacity eventually get 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.180
 intended 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.650
 so be true fans 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.450
 of music and movies that want 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.200
 to put a lot in their phone or 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.409
 their tablet 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.470
 that you understood it because good 183 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.150
 jlfo the charges and anyway and also 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.040
 for example we can imagine this 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.530
 application to fans of 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.759
 photos and videos including four cases 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.049
 because we know today we have 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.180
 smartphones that are able to do 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.640
 4k videos and 4k videos 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.560
 take a lot of size they have 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.299
 a heavy weight so it takes 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.909
 microsd cards that in front is able 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.460
 to precisely store this information 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.740
 very important 4k videos in all 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.390
 very voluminous case ten 4k videos and one 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.100
 is here in front of a microsd card that 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.540
 suits this kind of use a 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.430
 microsd card that still has its price 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.200
 must be frank we are in july 2015 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.610
 when I make this video july 2015 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.690
 remember in because when we 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.459
 watch this video from here 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.170
 years we will look at it from another eye 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.870
 but this micro SD card 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.120
 your more than 300 euros customer price 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.020
 maximum adviser is 329 euros of 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.180
 memory so we are on a map 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.650
 microsd which has its price and who makes pay 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.640
 finally the excellence that makes you pay 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.930
 brand excellence that makes you pay 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.819
 also the capabilities of measurements and the 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.040
 map here is the map is delivered 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.739
 despite everything in his little in his 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.080
 little cardboard case this little 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.340
 very classic pouch at sandisk who 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.870
 is the cover that we finally 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.310
 found for all the cards 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.489
 microsd of mark 1 so there is no 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.590
 great astonishing the map is a 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.420
 10 year warranty card is guaranteed 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.980
 ten years by brand and brand 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.610
 also claims that this map and 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.860
 waterproof is the resistors 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.299
 resistant forgiveness at temperatures 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.260
 temperature variations I you 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.880
 advises against putting it in 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.170
 an oven to see if he stands up when we 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.190
 said temperature variations we say 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.600
 up to 100 degrees I think of memory 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.580
 on the part of the brand so avoid 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.480
 to heat it unreasonably but 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.799
 in any case the heating of your 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.600
 smartphone is not supposed to be damaged the 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.910
 microsd card still happy you me 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.410
 say she is also supposed to be 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.970
 resistant to falls 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.260
 on the other hand I'm not sure that 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.580
 to launch his share land be a good 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.630
 idea to see if that really resists 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.380
 because at the price of the card it is worth 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:16.920
 better try to be treated 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.560
 correctly 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.510
 so overall the brand claims a 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.130
 lots of good points in terms of solidity 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.420
 I have not tested I will admit 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.769
 I do not want to break the map of the 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.630
 round in sandisk and that saturday what me 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.190
 the bill would be moderately funny 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.269
 but we are still on a map 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.190
 that was claiming as being 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.540
 guaranteed 10 years by the mark so that one 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.130
 speaks of 10 years and especially at the level 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.690
 of the fatigue of the micro SD card this is 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.310
 to say that by force of writing to read 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.799
 to write and read is especially to write 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.940
 delete write the card can be 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.530
 to tire is like all memories 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.940
 and everything after a while well 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.380
 when she is tired she becomes 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.180
 unusable becomes unworkable that 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.470
 happened to me as personal with 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.940
 SD cards including and of course the 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.230
 camcorders with which I film 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.820
 videos especially the video you're in 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.620
 Seeing this happened to me 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.400
 force to fling cards because 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.590
 that after a while she gets tired 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.090
 including you understood here is the 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.859
 guarantees 10 years obviously this is 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.250
 independent of the number of writings 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:07.260
 reading and so that's good point a 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.700
 micro SD card you imagine that makes 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.049
 not even the size of a fingernail 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.220
 it's amazing and who is able to 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:16.350
 store 183 gigabyte of data that 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.489
 has a speed of d2 read 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.430
 it's the speed of reading that 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.060
 claimed as being up to 90 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.710
 megabytes second 1 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.780
 believe it and who is endowed as well 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.060
 of this nice little accessory but 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.190
 it is a adapter for microsd card 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.530
 sd card format so here is a big 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.330
 classic that we find very very 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.110
 easily finally anyway who has the 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.090
 deserves to be provided free of charge 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.889
 precisely with the micro SD card but 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.360
 you understand it so it's not 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.860
 a video test is rather a video of 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.870
 presentation an informative videos and 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.790
 a web video faict what is a video 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.020
 wow where we come today with 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.520
 the size of the micro SD cards is 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.930
 just colossal a few years ago he 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.150
 two years ago is what you had 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.820
 imagined having a microsd card 283 giga 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.290
 200 gigabyte byte is what you 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.520
 would have imagined this kind of things 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.990
 so do not hesitate to comment 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.950
 in the in the east in the zone of 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.660

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.020
 will be published on your phone do not hesitate 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.990
 to comment to tell me exactly your 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.310
 own print on 7 out of 7 on this 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.950
 boom we'll say at the capacity level 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.000
 micro was aiming but it's colossal 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.930
 this is the sandisk brand which is a 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.270
 mark I remind him worries a 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.460
 extremely well known brand which is a

 bc fan etc since it's a brand 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.460
 who also makes ssd and all 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.120
 other storage solutions between 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.890
 well-known brands

 once again either or for a map 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.450
 of 2 100 giga what 2 100 giga is 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.669
 colossal in micro sd it's just 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.720
