you'll see that that's the bar that's
moving<00:01:23.750> there<00:01:24.110> the<00:01:24.320> squat<00:01:24.560> stands<00:01:24.860> themselves

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
moving there the squat stands themselves

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.550 
moving there the squat stands themselves
aren't<00:01:26.119> going<00:01:26.420> anywhere<00:01:26.600> they're<00:01:27.110> very<00:01:27.320> very

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
aren't going anywhere they're very very

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.999 
aren't going anywhere they're very very
solid<00:01:27.829> just<00:01:28.759> to<00:01:29.000> illustrate<00:01:29.659> that<00:01:30.259> point<00:01:30.530> if<00:01:30.829> I

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
solid just to illustrate that point if I

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.090 
solid just to illustrate that point if I
pick<00:01:31.219> the<00:01:31.340> bar<00:01:31.520> up<00:01:31.850> for<00:01:32.600> example<00:01:33.110> and<00:01:33.290> I<00:01:33.649> do<00:01:33.710> my

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
pick the bar up for example and I do my

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.600 
pick the bar up for example and I do my
squat<00:01:34.960> bringing<00:01:35.960> this<00:01:36.049> back<00:01:36.320> you'll<00:01:37.100> see<00:01:37.130> that

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
squat bringing this back you'll see that

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.450 
squat bringing this back you'll see that
I<00:01:37.880> can<00:01:38.360> get<00:01:38.570> there<00:01:38.780> be<00:01:39.680> quite<00:01:39.950> rough<00:01:40.189> with<00:01:40.430> it

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
I can get there be quite rough with it

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.179 
I can get there be quite rough with it
and<00:01:40.729> it's<00:01:41.420> solid<00:01:41.810> it<00:01:42.140> doesn't<00:01:42.170> fall<00:01:42.740> it's<00:01:43.009> not

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
and it's solid it doesn't fall it's not

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.209 
and it's solid it doesn't fall it's not
going<00:01:43.490> anywhere<00:01:43.579> so<00:01:44.119> dual<00:01:44.869> quality<00:01:45.380> is<00:01:45.560> what

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:46.219 
going anywhere so dual quality is what

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:48.310 
going anywhere so dual quality is what
these<00:01:46.430> things<00:01:46.670> are<00:01:46.880> all<00:01:47.000> about<00:01:47.119> the<00:01:48.020> einige

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
these things are all about the einige
