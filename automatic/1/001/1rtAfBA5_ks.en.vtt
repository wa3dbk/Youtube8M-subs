00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
what I'm doing when I'm melting lead and

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.939 
what I'm doing when I'm melting lead and
I<00:00:32.750> why<00:00:33.050> I'm<00:00:33.710> melting<00:00:34.040> it<00:00:34.460> instead<00:00:35.059> of<00:00:35.120> just

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:35.949 
I why I'm melting it instead of just

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:38.500 
I why I'm melting it instead of just
melting<00:00:36.949> it<00:00:37.070> and<00:00:37.100> putting<00:00:37.850> it<00:00:37.940> directly<00:00:38.059> into

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
melting it and putting it directly into

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.530 
melting it and putting it directly into
sinkers<00:00:39.050> number<00:00:39.890> one<00:00:40.160> I<00:00:40.489> take<00:00:41.210> a<00:00:41.269> lot<00:00:41.510> of

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
sinkers number one I take a lot of

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.580 
sinkers number one I take a lot of
scraplet<00:00:42.820> like<00:00:43.820> buckets<00:00:44.360> that<00:00:44.570> take<00:00:45.140> a<00:00:45.170> lot<00:00:45.440> of

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
scraplet like buckets that take a lot of

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.160 
scraplet like buckets that take a lot of
room<00:00:45.800> and<00:00:46.120> I<00:00:47.120> melt<00:00:47.390> them<00:00:47.570> down<00:00:47.600> into<00:00:48.050> little

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
room and I melt them down into little

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.860 
room and I melt them down into little
biscuits<00:00:48.980> or<00:00:49.309> ingots<00:00:50.089> whatever<00:00:50.510> you<00:00:50.600> want<00:00:50.780> to

biscuits or ingots whatever you want to
call<00:00:51.079> them<00:00:51.230> so<00:00:52.010> they're<00:00:52.220> easier<00:00:52.550> to<00:00:52.610> handle

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089

and<00:00:53.210> they're<00:00:53.300> easier<00:00:53.659> to<00:00:53.720> put<00:00:54.079> into<00:00:54.489> the

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
and they're easier to put into the

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.619 
and they're easier to put into the
pouring<00:00:56.239> pot<00:00:56.510> for<00:00:57.409> the<00:00:57.440> sinkers<00:00:58.190> so<00:00:58.909> I<00:00:59.269> want<00:00:59.540> to

lit<00:01:44.240> and<00:01:44.689> we'll<00:01:45.079> start<00:01:45.350> melting<00:01:45.560> lid<00:01:48.069> all

00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:49.069 
lit and we'll start melting lid all

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:52.690 
lit and we'll start melting lid all
right<00:01:49.310> now<00:01:49.719> at<00:01:50.719> the<00:01:50.990> lead<00:01:51.590> starting<00:01:52.100> to<00:01:52.219> melt

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
right now at the lead starting to melt

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.289 
right now at the lead starting to melt
we'll<00:01:52.999> put<00:01:53.299> some<00:01:53.929> lead<00:01:54.200> pipe<00:01:55.090> into<00:01:56.090> the

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
we'll put some lead pipe into the

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.760 
we'll put some lead pipe into the
container<00:01:56.979> it's<00:01:57.979> always<00:01:58.310> a<00:01:58.340> lot<00:01:58.579> easier<00:01:59.770> to

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
container it's always a lot easier to

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.450 
container it's always a lot easier to
wait<00:02:00.920> till<00:02:01.130> it<00:02:01.280> starts<00:02:01.639> melting<00:02:01.939> it

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
wait till it starts melting it

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.240 
wait till it starts melting it
and<00:02:03.910> then<00:02:04.240> put<00:02:04.540> the<00:02:04.750> lady<00:02:04.990> in<00:02:05.170> because<00:02:05.890> the<00:02:06.070> hot

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
and then put the lady in because the hot

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.700 
and then put the lady in because the hot
lead<00:02:06.520> actually<00:02:06.850> helps<00:02:07.390> it<00:02:07.510> no<00:02:07.690> flaw<00:02:07.990> pastor

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
lead actually helps it no flaw pastor

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.900

and just sitting I'm trying to melt pipe

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.970 
and just sitting I'm trying to melt pipe
right<00:02:13.390> off<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.690> bat<00:02:13.930> so<00:02:14.850> I'm<00:02:15.850> gonna<00:02:15.970> put<00:02:16.210> some

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
right off the bat so I'm gonna put some

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:24.140 
right off the bat so I'm gonna put some
LED<00:02:17.980> in<00:02:18.190> here<00:02:21.840> bring<00:02:22.840> a<00:02:22.990> cooling<00:02:23.410> bucket<00:02:23.800> in

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
now we'll let this ledge solidify or

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.260 
now we'll let this ledge solidify or
that's<00:02:27.640> a<00:02:27.820> little<00:02:27.970> private<00:02:28.450> to<00:02:29.020> melt<00:02:29.290> and<00:02:30.270> then

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
that's a little private to melt and then

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.470 
that's a little private to melt and then
we'll<00:02:31.450> get<00:02:31.870> ready<00:02:32.080> to<00:02:32.320> pour<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:32.980> lead<00:02:33.220> into

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
we'll get ready to pour the lead into

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:40.670 
we'll get ready to pour the lead into

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.020 
melting and as soon as I get this melted
I'll<00:03:02.069> show<00:03:02.220> you<00:03:02.310> how<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.459> remove<00:03:02.700> the

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
I'll show you how to remove the

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.210 
I'll show you how to remove the
impurities

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.240 

okay<00:03:09.959> last<00:03:10.959> feats<00:03:11.319> of<00:03:11.470> LEDs<00:03:11.739> almost

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
okay last feats of LEDs almost

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.990 
okay last feats of LEDs almost
completely<00:03:12.700> melted<00:03:14.250> you<00:03:15.250> see<00:03:15.519> the<00:03:15.670> stuff

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
completely melted you see the stuff

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.259 
completely melted you see the stuff
floating<00:03:16.360> on<00:03:16.660> the<00:03:16.810> top<00:03:17.790> that<00:03:18.790> is<00:03:19.060> the

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
floating on the top that is the

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.660 
floating on the top that is the
impurities<00:03:19.980> lead-pipe<00:03:20.980> of<00:03:21.250> stuff<00:03:21.489> you're

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
impurities lead-pipe of stuff you're

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.210 
impurities lead-pipe of stuff you're
going<00:03:21.790> to<00:03:21.879> have<00:03:22.030> a<00:03:22.060> lot<00:03:22.390> of<00:03:23.220> impurities

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
going to have a lot of impurities

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.240 
going to have a lot of impurities
because<00:03:24.489> of<00:03:24.640> the<00:03:24.730> gunk<00:03:24.970> gets<00:03:25.239> inside<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:25.900> pop

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
because of the gunk gets inside the pop

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.550 
because of the gunk gets inside the pop
inside<00:03:27.250> the<00:03:27.400> pipe<00:03:28.019> so<00:03:29.019> what<00:03:29.170> we're<00:03:29.349> going<00:03:29.470> to

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
inside the pipe so what we're going to

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.630 
inside the pipe so what we're going to
do<00:03:29.800> take<00:03:30.519> this<00:03:30.700> spoon<00:03:31.980> break<00:03:32.980> it<00:03:33.160> over<00:03:33.280> to<00:03:33.489> one

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
do take this spoon break it over to one

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.140 
do take this spoon break it over to one
side<00:03:33.700> and<00:03:35.040> that's<00:03:36.040> the<00:03:36.190> impurities<00:03:36.910> right

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
side and that's the impurities right

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.130 
side and that's the impurities right
there

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
there

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.500 
there
so<00:03:39.650> be<00:03:39.860> I'm<00:03:40.070> not<00:03:40.250> really<00:03:40.550> worried<00:03:41.210> too<00:03:41.480> much

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
so be I'm not really worried too much

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.090 
so be I'm not really worried too much
about<00:03:41.780> grass<00:03:43.990> fall<00:03:44.990> everything's<00:03:45.590> melting

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
about grass fall everything's melting

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:52.090 
about grass fall everything's melting
anyway<00:03:46.550> or

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.920 

grasses

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
grasses

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:00.480 
grasses
starting<00:03:54.650> to<00:03:54.709> die<00:03:54.920> around<00:03:55.340> here<00:03:55.610> anyway<00:03:56.980> so

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:00.490 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.870 

this<00:04:01.090> the<00:04:01.930> impurities<00:04:02.440> here<00:04:02.710> is<00:04:02.860> more<00:04:03.700> or<00:04:03.820> less

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
this the impurities here is more or less

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.210 
this the impurities here is more or less
dirt<00:04:04.420> from<00:04:04.750> the<00:04:04.870> inside<00:04:05.200> of<00:04:05.320> the<00:04:05.380> pipe<00:04:05.590> outside

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
dirt from the inside of the pipe outside

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.990 
dirt from the inside of the pipe outside
of<00:04:06.370> pipe<00:04:07.050> and<00:04:08.050> try<00:04:08.350> to<00:04:08.410> get<00:04:08.710> as<00:04:09.130> much<00:04:09.370> out<00:04:09.670> as<00:04:09.730> I

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
of pipe and try to get as much out as I

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.900 
of pipe and try to get as much out as I
can<00:04:10.330> and<00:04:11.230> we<00:04:11.410> when<00:04:11.650> Curtis<00:04:12.460> gets<00:04:12.700> to<00:04:12.910> pouring

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
can and we when Curtis gets to pouring

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.830 
can and we when Curtis gets to pouring
there<00:04:15.910> won't<00:04:16.120> be<00:04:16.209> anything<00:04:16.510> to<00:04:16.750> clog<00:04:17.200> the

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
there won't be anything to clog the

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.290 
there won't be anything to clog the
melter<00:04:20.070> we<00:04:21.070> pour<00:04:21.459> the<00:04:21.640> samples

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
melter we pour the samples

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.469 
melter we pour the samples
so<00:04:23.840> with<00:04:24.020> that<00:04:24.819> now<00:04:25.819> we're<00:04:26.000> going<00:04:26.150> to<00:04:26.210> pour

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 
so with that now we're going to pour

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:57.339 
so with that now we're going to pour
into<00:04:26.810> the<00:04:27.229> pan

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:57.349 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:04:58.899 

and<00:04:57.830> then<00:04:58.009> we'll<00:04:58.159> leave<00:04:58.339> a<00:04:58.369> little<00:04:58.610> bit<00:04:58.849> in

00:04:58.899 --> 00:04:58.909 
and then we'll leave a little bit in

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:06.510 
and then we'll leave a little bit in
there<00:05:00.399> so<00:05:01.399> let<00:05:02.389> them<00:05:02.539> start<00:05:02.990> melting<00:05:03.289> again

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:13.179 

instead<00:05:07.520> of<00:05:07.580> having<00:05:07.699> to<00:05:09.099> start<00:05:10.099> all<00:05:10.460> over<00:05:12.189> the

00:05:13.179 --> 00:05:13.189 
instead of having to start all over the

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:15.989 
instead of having to start all over the
lead<00:05:13.430> will<00:05:13.639> start<00:05:13.969> melting<00:05:14.210> a<00:05:14.479> lot<00:05:14.659> quicker<00:05:14.930> if

00:05:15.989 --> 00:05:15.999 
lead will start melting a lot quicker if

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:19.769 
lead will start melting a lot quicker if
there's<00:05:16.999> a<00:05:17.119> melted<00:05:17.899> lead<00:05:18.080> liquid<00:05:18.559> in<00:05:18.710> there

00:05:19.769 --> 00:05:19.779 
there's a melted lead liquid in there

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:27.909 
there's a melted lead liquid in there
you<00:05:20.779> seem<00:05:21.050> to<00:05:21.229> milk<00:05:21.439> a<00:05:21.589> lot<00:05:21.710> faster<00:05:22.399> so

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:33.160 

put<00:05:28.219> some<00:05:28.430> more<00:05:28.580> lead<00:05:28.849> in<00:05:29.060> here

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:33.170 

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:38.050 

start<00:05:33.770> melting<00:05:34.280> that<00:05:34.490> as<00:05:34.820> well<00:05:36.910> in<00:05:37.910> the

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
start melting that as well in the

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:44.560 
start melting that as well in the
meantime<00:05:40.300> as<00:05:41.300> soon<00:05:41.540> as<00:05:41.720> these<00:05:43.270> harden<00:05:44.270> for<00:05:44.480> a

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
meantime as soon as these harden for a

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.260 
meantime as soon as these harden for a
few<00:05:44.780> more<00:05:44.930> minutes<00:05:45.790> what<00:05:46.790> I'm<00:05:46.880> going<00:05:47.090> to<00:05:47.150> end

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
few more minutes what I'm going to end

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.230 
few more minutes what I'm going to end
up<00:05:47.330> doing<00:05:47.540> is<00:05:47.810> picking<00:05:48.050> up<00:05:48.290> the<00:05:48.320> pan<00:05:49.240> and

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
up doing is picking up the pan and

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.470 
up doing is picking up the pan and
dumping<00:05:50.810> it<00:05:50.930> in<00:05:51.080> the<00:05:51.170> water<00:05:52.030> and<00:05:53.030> now<00:05:53.120> to<00:05:53.180> cool

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:53.480 
dumping it in the water and now to cool

00:05:53.480 --> 00:06:17.900 
dumping it in the water and now to cool
them<00:05:53.660> off<00:05:53.720> quicker<00:05:54.140> so<00:05:54.500> I<00:05:54.560> can<00:05:54.740> handle<00:05:55.040> them

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:17.910 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:24.160 

okay<00:06:19.940> now<00:06:20.940> that<00:06:21.210> these<00:06:21.390> have<00:06:21.720> solidified<00:06:23.030> is

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:24.170 
okay now that these have solidified is

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:28.640 
okay now that these have solidified is
Japan<00:06:25.670> couple<00:06:26.670> pan<00:06:26.910> mix<00:06:27.210> here

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:28.650 
Japan couple pan mix here

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.640 
Japan couple pan mix here
and<00:06:29.160> then<00:06:29.280> I'm<00:06:29.400> just<00:06:29.460> going<00:06:29.820> to<00:06:29.880> dump<00:06:30.090> them<00:06:30.650> in

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:31.650 
and then I'm just going to dump them in

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:38.120 
and then I'm just going to dump them in
the<00:06:31.830> water<00:06:33.830> good<00:06:34.830> here<00:06:35.360> gargling<00:06:36.680> and<00:06:37.680> that's

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.130 
the water good here gargling and that's

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:38.930 
the water good here gargling and that's
basically<00:06:38.639> it

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:38.940 
basically it

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.990 
basically it
those<00:06:39.240> are<00:06:39.570> pretty<00:06:40.500> well<00:06:40.830> ready<00:06:41.130> to<00:06:41.520> go<00:06:41.940> to

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 
those are pretty well ready to go to

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.990 
those are pretty well ready to go to
Curtis<00:06:42.680> as<00:06:43.680> soon<00:06:43.919> as<00:06:44.070> I<00:06:44.160> get<00:06:44.370> enough<00:06:44.490> of<00:06:44.850> them

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 
Curtis as soon as I get enough of them

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.320 
Curtis as soon as I get enough of them
get<00:06:45.210> them<00:06:45.330> stacked<00:06:45.660> up<00:06:45.930> and<00:06:46.199> put<00:06:46.740> in<00:06:46.860> container

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:47.330 
get them stacked up and put in container

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.180 
get them stacked up and put in container
I'll<00:06:48.330> take<00:06:48.570> them<00:06:48.750> to<00:06:48.780> Commerc<00:06:49.199> Curtis<00:06:49.889> and

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:50.190 
I'll take them to Commerc Curtis and

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:53.030 
I'll take them to Commerc Curtis and
then<00:06:50.460> he'll<00:06:50.610> start<00:06:50.910> the<00:06:51.030> melting<00:06:51.360> process<00:06:52.040> to

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:53.040 
then he'll start the melting process to

00:06:53.040 --> 00:07:03.510 
then he'll start the melting process to
actually<00:06:53.430> make<00:06:53.910> them<00:06:54.090> into<00:06:54.270> sinkers

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.580 

you
