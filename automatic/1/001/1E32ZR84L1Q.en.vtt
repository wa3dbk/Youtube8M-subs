00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.460
 [music] 

00:00:04.669 --> 00:00:09.660
 hello and good day with 

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:10.830
 you again scorpion and my small guide 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.320
 on the game dota 2 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.849
 this game came to me completely 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.250
 by chance thanks to one of my 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.770
 subscribers on youtube that because 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.770
 found in style thanks a lot to him for 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.960
 present that's why i decided to do it 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.420
 video as much as I understand is not much in 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.780
 the game began to play relatively recently 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.759
 here are just a couple of weeks and weeks I 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.730
 I don't remember exactly, but this is why I decided 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.640
 do all the same this guide for 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.859
 to explain to you all the same some 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.300
 the basics of what you need to do as soon as 

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:47.429
 get into the arena that's why it decided 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.890
 do because when i logged in first 

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:52.230
 Once in the game I did not know where to reap 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.909
 do not how to properly buy something 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.129
 total purchase is not where it comes from 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:58.620
 inventory and so on explain this 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.539
 no one of course told me 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.179
 go watch the video on youtube there either 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.430
 friend any way de see a video in 

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:09.180
 Internet as the correct red network 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.010
 that's why they melted me so fast because 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.840
 that no matter how I started trying yet 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.760
 a little bit to tell you well as usual i am 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:20.070
 was like a misguided spy player 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.260
 a team that just stupidly prevented play 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:27.240
 to other players why because the game 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:28.890
 command is very important in it 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.760
 team game that is to say 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.970
 and 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.730
 and I just spoiled everything why would I 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.410
 I will not explain everything here including now 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.570

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.540
 how should i do as soon as you 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.930

 whale tactics of all rpb standard yes 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.590
 you need to beat some 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:13.970
 there about the press yes to be charged 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.380
 experience in this game do it not 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.449
 sure you can be 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.180
 side by side let's win the first time 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:23.479
 play you wanna rock you just 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:27.009
 stay close for what experiences and 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:29.300
 your team's rashi hero kills 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:31.130
 opposing team players to you 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:35.719
 accrued experience . you do n't even 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:37.920
 be sure to participate in the battle for 

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:39.850
 order to pump about 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.640
 pumped out gradually fell out 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:45.940
 it turns out the next levels why 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:49.480
 you can not die on the line but why 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:52.950
 and desirable because for the fact that 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:55.390
 kills you let's say so like a hero 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:59.080
 player enemy team accrued 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:01.540
 much more experience more experience 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:04.180
 faster pumping stronger players 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:06.730
 enemy team accordingly you on 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.650
 bend much faster than if you do n’t 

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:12.070
 perished yes that is it really 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:15.280
 very important on the first levels in principle 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:16.900
 climb will not be sure that's what 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.060
 he still stands sometimes involved 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:22.360
 battles because if you are finishing up 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:24.490
 score player or moba 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.520
 It is charged in addition to the experience that you would 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:30.010
 And so on was listed to you for it give still 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.620
 money get money buy 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:34.210
 the next subject is there such 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:38.950
 items that can only be purchased 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:41.050
 in secret shops is a secret shop 

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:43.570
 Now I will try to show on the minimap 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:48.340
 but pay attention to the minimap they 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:51.460
 are here in this here 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:53.290
 here are additional shops in 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:55.600
 which are sold in principle ordinary 

00:06:53.290 --> 00:07:00.490
 subjects we respawn here they are 

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:03.760
 here and here this way your 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:06.340
 The main task for faster pumping 

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:10.120
 rendered players of the enemy team 

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:12.940
 and all their guns here are more detailed like 

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:16.090
 There would be a review there or a more detailed guide 

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:18.760
 let's say i did teach later when 

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:21.280
 more Understand the basics of the game pit 

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:22.930
 He said that he was a hundred and then not 

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.710
 worth doing where what buttons 

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:26.140
 press 

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:28.540
