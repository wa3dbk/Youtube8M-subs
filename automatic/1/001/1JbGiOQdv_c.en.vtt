 mountain runners the ultra trail of the 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:33.030
 mont blanc and in principle it would be one of 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.910
 your strengths of the season for 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.780
 people who do not know the ultra 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.510
 trail mont blanc 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.129
 you could comment a little bit quickly 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.350
 What is special about the layout of the 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.350
 good race yes 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.550
 a cycling tour of france for 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.239
 us for the people who run for 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.079
 mountain or gastón saiz judges like inside 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.990
 from france 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.720
 the good tracing are 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.490
 the distance that has been taken now as 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.070
 ultra reference that are 100 miles 

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:08.229
 hundreds 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.900
 km 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.320
 peculiarity 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.420
 I dont know 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.300
 that goes around the mont-blanc that goes by 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.680
 three countries 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.770
 we went through three countries 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:26.060
 and that is nine thousand six hundred meters 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.560
 positive and other negative and above all 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.930
 the atmosphere that is seen in this race 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.940
 that you can not find it 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.330
 It would be like a 160 kilometer zegama 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.940
 almost this man at night there is no 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.980
 So many people out there but yes but good 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.840
 during the day the exit to the goals the 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.840
 villages when we cross 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.909
 so 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.560
 how do you see the list of favorites for this 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.360
 year why 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.820
 in principle to be provided for 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.659
 participation of the most habitual winner 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.479
 of the test and seen last year by 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.940
 example you made is a great career 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.750
 until you reach the train where you could not 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.940
 follow you face this year as you see 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.709
 the most open race or do you think 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.420
 will once again highlight the same 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:22.890
 of the previous year or finally the 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:25.560
 Americans will do something good 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.959
 who is not here 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.380
 Well first I would like 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.380
 I was 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.900
 you are a better runner than there is now 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.799
 same as 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.799
 there is a motivation 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.510
 behind that it's like winning but 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.440
 well the one that is not I think that for 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.440
 many people are going to be 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:54.890
 a relief not to win or not but value for 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:03:00.050
 lose that fear of this year I'm going to 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:02.630
 try when he was going to the best not 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.370
 and there we go with the idea of ​​good second 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:08.860
 third quarter and it's fine but now 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:11.140
 to miss the surely more d 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.420
 10 riders have the power in mind 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.069
 go to dispute the race not 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.160
 this is going to make the 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:22.170
 which is going to be an open year this year 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:24.300
 for many people it will go a lot of people 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.830
 confident that they can go forward and that 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.850
 I think it's going to be very good for us 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.130
 what 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.300
 high and that the race is 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.190
 be quick 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.260
 and good among the good favorites already 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.430
 you know the Americans that are there 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.870
 whenever they are a bit of an unknown 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.240
 they are very fast but we are going for this 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:47.660
 ground is not so good for them 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.640
 but well I would not trust, I think 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.340
 can go very fast and is not a 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.420
 ground 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:59.569
 very technical the soft nougat 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.569
 this is quite a runner in quotes 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:07.350
 and they run pretty good but 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.080
 by the French of 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.680
 each year are later made 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.680
 Sebastian 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.620
 the Spaniards I would say that and that was 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.320
 is 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.139
 it's very good it 's very strong if it has 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.780
 enough motivation at that time 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:28.080
 Well, I think it's going to be one of the 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:30.440
 favorites and I'll go there to see what 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.440
 pass 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:37.410
 How is it happening? How is the 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:40.169
 phenomenal race well so be it 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.410
 we would have fought up to thirty and more 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.410
 there
