00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 Hello Internet! My name is Dan and, inspired by AmazingPhil, today for you 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.830
 I have a tour of my brain. 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.389
 I bought this strange X-ray on e-bayi ... I'm not quite sure how it works. 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:13.620
 I'll just put it in front of me. 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.060
 All right, here we are! 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.130
 Wow, human brains are disgusting ... anyway, let's see what we have here. 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.510
 Oh, my receptor social skills 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.710
 Jop, as you can see, the connector that connects it to these motor neurons and the speech center ... 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.930
 it is somehow damaged. 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.980
 It has always been the case. Here's the daydreaming separation 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.800
 which is responsible for all random thoughts that somehow end 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.300
 on the foreground of my consciousness. 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.059
 I also think the missing synapses from the receptor might have ended up here 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.809
 social skills, which would explain my monologue problem. 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.440
 Here we have an area that once controlled my natural reactions 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.699
 for shocking and disturbing images, but as you can see, it is more or less completely 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:57.899
 wrinkled and dead. 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.260
 I believe it happened sometime when I started using the Internet. 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.550
 And here? 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.939
 Oh, my style. Fakt cool. 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.760
 Yep, create it took a lot of time. And what is this? Ah, the center of distraction 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.360
 this contains all the things that I have convinced myself are more important 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.000
 than duties like eating and reading mails and unnecessarily long 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.650
 čurpauzy with mobile 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.830
 But sometimes even these things aren't strong enough to control me 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.409
 and the signals get up here 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.210
 into an escalating corner full of fictional universes 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.230
 where you can get lost and live through them. 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.260
 Oh, I wish I could spend my whole life here ... 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.100
 And I do it again, I'm doing it again ... yep when I'm done here, 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.040
 it's too late - it's all down for the day. 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.080
 And what ... oh, lobe envy. Yep, I'm trying not to come here too often 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.800
 the giant green monster that lives here. Honestly, he's a pretty bastard 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.730
 and is not very useful. 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.290
 I'm trying to get rid of him. And here's a constant rhythm generator. 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.730
 I literally always have a song in my head and if I don't sing it right or not, 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.320
 I'll tap her on the table. 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.380
 People at school literally sat off because they were 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.730
 so pissed off my tapping. Now, this is my center of logic and rationality. 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.930
 The core of my brain that controls my faith in impartiality and decent discussion 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.250
 or, as my parents like to be, an annoying cleverness. 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.030
 And here we have an opinion bark 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.000
 jop, when I see something I need to express my opinion instead of 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.290
 to say them 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.730
 they just buy here. I keep a lot of anger here 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.150
 ignorance in the world, so it is after such a long time of repression 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.230
 in pretty poor condition. 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.080
 She was shaking for a few weeks as if she were about to explode, so 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.360
 I slowly drop pieces from it. And this is the fear corridor. 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.080
 Yeah, the usual fears hidden in this thing that are no problem 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.230
 until the sun sets. He usually opens at that moment and scares me to death. 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.459
 Great. And here's the cave of remorse! 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.270
 Such a bleak memorial to all the things I wished to be or to do. 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.040
 You know, ordinary unfulfilled dreams and four-year-old New Year's resolutions. 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.940
 I'm trying not to think about them. 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:14.360
 Okay, what else do we have here? Oh, this? It's a pit 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.800
 existential crisis 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.120
 here's the gaping black gulf that pulls me into a spiral of despair, 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.840
 doubting whether he has any meaning or whether our lives are at all 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.840
 relevant. 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.290
 Look at it, look at the darkness. 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.870
 Whoa, yep, be careful with this thing. Believe me - if you fall there, 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.450
 you just won't leave. 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.250
 Somehow it has grown alarmingly in recent years, but I'm working on it 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.410
 And I guess this was my brain ... 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.360
 yep, this is happening in my head. 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:56.010
 Well, this was fun ... why did I actually want to do that? 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.349
 Yep! Last thing: here's a sexy endscreen zone. 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:04.980
 if you enjoyed this trip, give me a look and if you want, 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.430
 start removing Dan's channel to see more of his videos. 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.049
 Also, why not explore our new game channel or our merch 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.799
 which one I bet you haven't heard about, because that's something Dan feels good about 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.019
 he doesn't talk constantly, so it's frankly a little annoying. Like: I understand it, Dan, 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.630
 you're excited about them, but that doesn't mean you have to talk about it literally 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.050
 constantly. Okay, that might be enough. 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.669
 I wonder what the complaint rules are about this thing.
