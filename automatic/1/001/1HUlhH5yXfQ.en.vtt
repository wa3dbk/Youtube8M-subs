before<00:00:02.659> from<00:00:03.659> me<00:00:03.840> regarding<00:00:04.830> watercolor

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
before from me regarding watercolor

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.820 
before from me regarding watercolor
painting<00:00:05.759> I<00:00:06.000> would<00:00:06.990> say<00:00:07.200> that<00:00:07.410> you<00:00:07.589> know<00:00:07.680> the

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
painting I would say that you know the

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.220 
painting I would say that you know the
key<00:00:08.040> component<00:00:08.700> of<00:00:08.760> watercolor<00:00:09.300> isn't<00:00:09.630> isn't

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
key component of watercolor isn't isn't

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.009 
key component of watercolor isn't isn't
color<00:00:10.790> its<00:00:11.790> tone<00:00:12.120> you<00:00:12.330> should<00:00:12.540> call<00:00:12.750> water

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
color its tone you should call water

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.820 
color its tone you should call water
tone<00:00:13.349> nor<00:00:13.769> water<00:00:13.950> color<00:00:14.480> so<00:00:15.590> it's<00:00:16.590> all<00:00:16.800> very

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
tone nor water color so it's all very

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.490 
tone nor water color so it's all very
dependent<00:00:17.730> on<00:00:17.940> how<00:00:18.660> much<00:00:18.810> paint<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.199> mix<00:00:19.410> with

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
dependent on how much paint you mix with

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.710 
dependent on how much paint you mix with
how<00:00:19.619> much<00:00:19.770> water<00:00:20.010> obviously<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:21.390> this<00:00:21.510> is<00:00:21.689> a

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
how much water obviously and this is a

how much water obviously and this is a
very<00:00:22.170> strong<00:00:23.070> mix<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:24.269> cerulean<00:00:24.900> blue<00:00:25.170> here

a<00:00:38.730> very<00:00:38.940> accurate<00:00:41.510> idea<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.809> my<00:00:43.559> tones<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.340> by<00:00:44.550> I

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
a very accurate idea of my tones is by I

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.490 
a very accurate idea of my tones is by I
need<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.120> be<00:00:45.210> accurate<00:00:45.420> with<00:00:45.780> how<00:00:45.899> much<00:00:46.079> water

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
need to be accurate with how much water

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.279 
need to be accurate with how much water
out<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.460> how<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.670> do<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.140> just<00:00:49.140> with<00:00:49.230> a

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
out and is this how I do it just with a

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.240 
out and is this how I do it just with a
straight-up<00:00:49.670> medical<00:00:50.670> syringe<00:00:51.000> there<00:00:51.300> and

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
straight-up medical syringe there and

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.290 
straight-up medical syringe there and
you<00:00:53.250> can<00:00:53.550> get<00:00:53.879> literally<00:00:55.399> drop<00:00:56.399> by<00:00:56.640> drop<00:00:56.699> I

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
you can get literally drop by drop I

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.439 
you can get literally drop by drop I
don't<00:00:58.260> need<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.500> at<00:00:58.620> this<00:00:58.710> point<00:00:58.980> but<00:00:59.850> you<00:01:00.120> can

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
don't need to at this point but you can

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.470 
don't need to at this point but you can
control<00:01:00.840> very<00:01:01.590> very<00:01:01.859> precisely<00:01:02.300> how<00:01:03.300> much

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
control very very precisely how much

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.050 
control very very precisely how much
water<00:01:03.809> you're<00:01:04.769> putting<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.330> okay<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.390> that's<00:01:06.920> 5

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
water you're putting in okay so that's 5

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.030 
water you're putting in okay so that's 5
millimeters<00:01:09.060> millilitres<00:01:10.020> sorry<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:10.979> I

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
millimeters millilitres sorry so I

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.350 
millimeters millilitres sorry so I
reckon<00:01:11.340> at<00:01:11.400> this<00:01:11.520> point<00:01:11.760> we'll<00:01:11.880> probably<00:01:12.030> half

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
reckon at this point we'll probably half

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:19.730 
reckon at this point we'll probably half
the<00:01:14.150> tone<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.509> paint<00:01:18.229> so<00:01:19.229> that's<00:01:19.380> kind<00:01:19.710> of

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
the tone of that paint so that's kind of

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.770 
the tone of that paint so that's kind of
roughly<00:01:20.299> speaking<00:01:22.670> half<00:01:23.670> half<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.390> tonal

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
roughly speaking half half the tonal

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.429 
roughly speaking half half the tonal
value<00:01:25.140> there<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:26.750> you<00:01:27.750> can<00:01:27.869> just<00:01:27.900> pick<00:01:28.170> up<00:01:28.320> a

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
value there and you can just pick up a

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.710 
value there and you can just pick up a
finish<00:01:28.799> pretty<00:01:29.040> much<00:01:29.189> any<00:01:30.150> pharmacy<00:01:32.720> five

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
finish pretty much any pharmacy five

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.410 
finish pretty much any pharmacy five
millimeter<00:01:34.200> one<00:01:34.350> milliliter<00:01:35.100> syringe<00:01:36.060> would

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
millimeter one milliliter syringe would

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.950 
millimeter one milliliter syringe would
do<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:37.460> and<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:39.119> go<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.659> can<00:01:39.810> just

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
do so and you go and you can just

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.999 
do so and you go and you can just
control<00:01:40.369> exactly<00:01:42.470> what<00:01:43.470> you're<00:01:43.619> putting<00:01:43.770> in

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
control exactly what you're putting in

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.469 
control exactly what you're putting in
drop<00:01:44.340> by<00:01:44.549> drop<00:01:46.250> and<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.430> other<00:01:47.549> thing<00:01:47.729> is<00:01:47.909> it

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
drop by drop and the other thing is it

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.780 
drop by drop and the other thing is it
keeps<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.899> water<00:01:49.049> very<00:01:49.350> clean<00:01:49.680> see<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.640> put

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
keeps the water very clean see and put

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.580 
keeps the water very clean see and put
always<00:01:51.119> pulling<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.509> out<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.990> completely

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
always pulling it out the completely

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.270 
always pulling it out the completely
pure<00:01:52.890> water<00:01:53.220> source<00:01:54.110> so<00:01:55.110> that's<00:01:56.100> one<00:01:56.430> way<00:01:58.280> see

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
pure water source so that's one way see

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.130 
pure water source so that's one way see
so<00:01:59.579> how<00:01:59.700> does<00:01:59.759> more<00:02:00.030> water<00:02:00.240> in<00:02:00.450> here<00:02:00.630> let's<00:02:00.869> say

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
so how does more water in here let's say

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.359 
so how does more water in here let's say
look<00:02:04.140> at<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:04.290> it's<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.770> little<00:02:04.979> bit<00:02:05.100> lighter

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
look at that it's a little bit lighter

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.410 
look at that it's a little bit lighter
again<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:07.940> syringes

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
again so syringes

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.709 
again so syringes
crucial<00:02:11.420> tool<00:02:11.629> for<00:02:11.930> watercolor<00:02:12.170> painting
