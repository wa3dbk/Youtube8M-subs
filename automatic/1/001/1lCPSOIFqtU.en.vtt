00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.199

 leave under the video 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.559
 But with the start of such funds is 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.080
 concealer from meybellin probably on 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.210
 more than one and a half years ago 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.670
 I use only this concealer from me 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.040
 absolutely satisfied he is just perfect 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.049
 masks all the flaws he masks 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.000
 as bruises under the eyes and some 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.380
 pimples redness some 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.320
 skin imperfections 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.750
 absolutely good and long stay nowhere 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.400
 no swimming nowhere does he have 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.900
 small minus have this product fast 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.450
 ends so i buy by 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.189
 I have several pieces at once in 0 1 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.200
 mm shades I usually take one because 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.280
 what suits me best 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.680
 most concealers on my skin 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.200
 lie either like some just wet 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.840
 powder either shines very much it doesn't 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.909
 like this concealer he does not shine 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.280
 does not shine well everything hides he 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.409
 does not look like powder well 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.720
 fixed on the skin nowhere swims not 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.220
 Slazit looks absolutely natural 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.920
 of course like many many concealer from 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.570
 clogged if all is normal 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.610
 to shade normally all nasty and 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.180
 fix it will look 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.730
 perfect 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.400
 further here is such a thing is wax for 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.530
 brows from eva mosaics i'm taking a thousand 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.450
 Once I told you I love this 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.860
 I also use the product for a long time 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.070
 I like him very much 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.530
 plain colorless just a pencil 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.570
 then I need to sharpen it a little here 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.870
 the tip broken off but nothing wrong 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.760
 okay eyebrow fixes perfectly even 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.620
 if I do not paint over eyebrows I 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.330
 just put this wax on well 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.410
 comb and go with normal not 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.630
 shaggy eyebrows 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.850
 i just love to draw arrows but i'm up 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.980
 so far I have not found my ideal 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.050
 eyeliner there are two eyeliners which of 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.690
 of all the variety under the water that I 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.070
 tried not liked the most 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.070
 The first is such an eyeliner 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.140
 revlon colorstay she lasted me 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.330
 three weeks just a splash for her now 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.450
 you can draw some kind of arrow 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.160
 but she already dried up I really liked 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.770
 that she gave absolutely matte effect 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.959
 and the skin came and flowed not floated not 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.940
 smeared me during the day but as 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.150
 all submarines she very quickly dried and 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.590
 is such eyeliner from oriflame hall I 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.630
 I can say that she is super duper standing 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.880
 they are matte she shines a little even in 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.830
 principle on the video it can be seen that she 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.660
 glitters in my eyes but she is good 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.880
 moves well holds and long 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.220
 worn again minus I have very 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.410
 quick dry one dried out 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.090
 tip I had to open the second so 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.489
 that part of the arrows i'm drawing this and 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.680
 the tip i'm drawing here is this they absolutely 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.019
 they are the same in my black shades 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.970
 if you find the perfect liner which 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.890
 does not dry at least three weeks four four 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.209
 please write in the comments 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.040
 because I just can't 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.930
 try all the sub in it to 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.700
 find one that does not dry quickly 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.070
 now move on to stew my first 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.019
 beloved mascara this is such a vov mascara 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.910
 I will show the mosaic archive somewhere 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.560
 He told his video about her, she 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.239
 she is extremely cool 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.430
 natural eyelashes does this here for 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.260
 those who love their natural eyelashes 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.960
 on them you need to tint for example like u 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.730
 me 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.250
 dream normal long curvy but they 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.440
 doing absolutely wear can be painted over 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.270
 This brush allows you to paint them 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.940
 so they will be completely natural 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:08.130
 natural if layered and this 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.570
 effect of false eyelashes or puffy 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.640
 some long eyelashes who do not 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.090
 but it will work out very well 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.070
 for 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.950
 for daily makeup 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:19.110
 there to the university to work crazy and 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:22.140
 I love the replacement she did not find the following too 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:25.230
 Here is such from oriflame also series Ivan 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:27.630
 we bring down with mascara this carcass is very 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.430
 strange thin little just 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.680
 tassel 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:34.200
 but good stains the eyelashes makes them 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.640
 very long some small or 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.800
 villi or chunks 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.990
 build up build up eyelashes 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.690
 and in principle, if you urinate a lot then 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.700
 you can just perfectly long puffing 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:48.800
 ladder draw also in oriflame 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:51.180
 there is the same too only she is 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.100
 the golden frame of this silver 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.470
 that golden so it will be even better than 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.120
 that's it yes in my opinion just five in one 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.310
 salute on the normal options and not at all 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.990
 worse carcasses that cost more because 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.420
 let's move pencils pencils 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.880
 for eyes kanzashi lip start with 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.650
 eyeliners I will show these 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.870
 here are three pencil to two pencils from 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.800
 oriflame and one pencil from essence i 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.560
 love smokey 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.420
 it's a black pencil kayal he's softer 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.700
 more gifts to him 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:20.100
 feather keeps up normally does not flow 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.870
 it does not float then it is generally 3 kopecks so 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.720
 that I advise everyone girls bathe 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.770
 try two pencils like this 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.960
 bath series 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.090
 but from oriflame pretty soft 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.980
 pencil draws well ok 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.270
 keeps costing nothing bad 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.130
 so I can not say about him 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.990
 Girls try and here's such 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.090
 small pencil is double sided 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:42.870
 pencils means on the black side 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:45.540
 white from oriflame series you limit here 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.280
 this black is tougher and you can 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.710
 draw a normal arrow which 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:52.110
 nowhere does not float away 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.330
 more resistant tighter estate 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.800
 pliable to drawing and shading but 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.140
 I like it too much I like it 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.610
 that the two sides with you on the road is very 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.550
 convenient to take for mucous 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.469
 so for example black shooter 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.150
 I also have the color from the same series 

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:07.860
 Here is such a pencil on one side 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.930
 turquoise color for fast on green 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.330
 I did the color with this pencil 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:14.340
 New Year's makeup me these pencils 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.960
 like this way a bit softer 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.090
 for some reason than this one 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.310
 to shade your foot better than a hundred 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:22.590
 pawn limit is 100 rubles and this is such 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.710
 pencil too from oriflame pencil for 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:27.990
 lips beautiful red shade deep 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:30.389
 deep red if you watch my 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:32.279
 the channel has long been almost all videos in 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:34.080
 which I with red lips or made out 

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:36.029
 Now with the help of a pencil 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.770
 get out the pencil at me 

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:39.750
 but he report to me somehow not at all 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.310
 going to end there and not kill 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:43.590
 shades are very beautiful so girls 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:45.599
 if you need lip pencils then 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:47.939
 pay attention to them very soft 

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:50.129
 good resistance is applied it is straight 

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:52.229
 i absorb myself all day 

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:54.240
 I can walk and not tint lips so 

00:06:52.229 --> 00:06:57.060

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:04.199
 shade is very cool i like 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:06.000
 what a small package so they don't 

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:07.830
 have time to dry and they have several times 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.020
 updated but because they are just very 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:12.060
