00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
people that aren't particularly good at

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.649 
people that aren't particularly good at
arguing<00:01:18.030> they<00:01:18.930> will<00:01:19.259> throw<00:01:20.189> personal<00:01:21.090> attacks

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
about and they might raise their voices

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.109 
about and they might raise their voices
walk<00:01:24.479> out<00:01:24.750> slam<00:01:25.229> doors<00:01:25.590> they<00:01:25.979> might<00:01:26.549> talk<00:01:26.790> down

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
walk out slam doors they might talk down

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.600 
walk out slam doors they might talk down
to<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.509> person<00:01:28.020> or<00:01:28.200> really<00:01:28.860> Stonewall<00:01:29.579> them

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
to the person or really Stonewall them

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.480 
to the person or really Stonewall them
and<00:01:29.970> give<00:01:30.090> them<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.270> cold<00:01:30.570> shoulder<00:01:31.159> and<00:01:32.159> so

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
and give them the cold shoulder and so

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.520 
and give them the cold shoulder and so
it<00:01:33.150> essentially<00:01:33.659> short-circuits<00:01:34.530> the

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
it essentially short-circuits the

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.149 
it essentially short-circuits the
argument<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.579> creates<00:01:36.030> great<00:01:36.360> tension

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
argument and it creates great tension

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.740 
argument and it creates great tension
whereas<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.280> people<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:38.700> are<00:01:38.729> very<00:01:38.939> good<00:01:39.570> at

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
whereas the people that are very good at

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.740 
whereas the people that are very good at
arguing<00:01:39.930> don't<00:01:40.770> do<00:01:40.979> those<00:01:41.189> things<00:01:41.689> okay<00:01:42.689> so

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
arguing don't do those things okay so

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.359 
arguing don't do those things okay so
what<00:01:43.259> do<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.530> people<00:01:43.680> who<00:01:44.040> are<00:01:44.130> good<00:01:44.340> at

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
what do the people who are good at

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.880 
what do the people who are good at
arguing<00:01:44.640> do<00:01:45.119> well<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.229> first<00:01:46.259> thing<00:01:46.619> they<00:01:46.829> do

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
arguing do well the first thing they do

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.249 
arguing do well the first thing they do
is<00:01:47.009> they<00:01:47.220> listen<00:01:47.520> but<00:01:47.640> they<00:01:47.759> don't<00:01:47.939> fix<00:01:48.259> so

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
is they listen but they don't fix so

don't fix another key factor if you like
to<00:02:29.480> healthy<00:02:30.110> arguing<00:02:30.560> is<00:02:30.710> that<00:02:31.010> you<00:02:31.430> let<00:02:31.670> the

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
to healthy arguing is that you let the

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.640 
to healthy arguing is that you let the
person<00:02:32.030> finish<00:02:32.600> and<00:02:32.930> you<00:02:33.020> acknowledge<00:02:33.230> their

person finish and you acknowledge their

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.620 
person finish and you acknowledge their
point<00:02:33.890> rather<00:02:34.610> than<00:02:34.820> coming<00:02:35.090> in<00:02:35.240> over<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.540> top

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
point rather than coming in over the top

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.140 
point rather than coming in over the top
you<00:02:36.560> know<00:02:36.650> some<00:02:36.830> people<00:02:37.100> are<00:02:37.130> terrible<00:02:37.580> say<00:02:38.000> in

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
you know some people are terrible say in

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.700 
you know some people are terrible say in
sessions<00:02:38.600> when<00:02:38.750> I'm<00:02:38.840> seeing<00:02:39.110> them<00:02:39.260> in<00:02:39.350> private

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
sessions when I'm seeing them in private

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.100 
sessions when I'm seeing them in private
practice<00:02:40.330> someone<00:02:41.330> will<00:02:41.420> start<00:02:41.600> talking<00:02:42.050> the

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
practice someone will start talking the

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.960 
practice someone will start talking the
other<00:02:42.140> one<00:02:42.350> will<00:02:42.440> go<00:02:42.500> no<00:02:42.710> now<00:02:43.430> I<00:02:43.460> don't<00:02:43.700> look<00:02:43.850> at

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
other one will go no now I don't look at

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.060 
other one will go no now I don't look at
it<00:02:44.030> like<00:02:44.090> that<00:02:44.240> or<00:02:44.930> they'll<00:02:45.410> finish<00:02:45.710> their

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
it like that or they'll finish their

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.010 
it like that or they'll finish their
conversations<00:02:46.880> and<00:02:46.970> I'll<00:02:47.120> just<00:02:47.300> jump<00:02:47.540> in<00:02:47.750> over

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
conversations and I'll just jump in over

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.380 
conversations and I'll just jump in over
the<00:02:48.110> top<00:02:48.140> and<00:02:48.650> you<00:02:48.770> literally<00:02:49.100> got<00:02:49.400> to<00:02:49.790> say<00:02:50.330> to

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
the top and you literally got to say to

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.750 
the top and you literally got to say to
them<00:02:50.570> hey<00:02:50.630> let<00:02:51.380> this<00:02:51.590> person<00:02:51.890> have<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.520> floor

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
them hey let this person have the floor

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.760 
them hey let this person have the floor
right<00:02:52.970> now<00:02:53.210> so<00:02:53.720> letting<00:02:53.960> them<00:02:54.230> finish<00:02:54.590> is

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
right now so letting them finish is

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.920 
right now so letting them finish is
really<00:02:54.800> important<00:02:55.610> and<00:02:55.760> the<00:02:56.240> bats<00:02:56.510> probably

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
really important and the bats probably

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.480 
really important and the bats probably
learned<00:02:57.170> behavior<00:02:57.710> isn't<00:02:57.890> it<00:02:58.100> it's<00:02:58.250> just

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
learned behavior isn't it it's just

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.220 
learned behavior isn't it it's just
perhaps<00:02:58.940> learn<00:02:59.150> from<00:02:59.420> their<00:02:59.600> parents<00:03:00.110> and

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
perhaps learn from their parents and

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.560 
perhaps learn from their parents and
people<00:03:00.620> have<00:03:00.950> been<00:03:01.130> around<00:03:01.400> you've<00:03:01.550> argued<00:03:01.760> so

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
people have been around you've argued so

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.960 
people have been around you've argued so
it's<00:03:02.690> not<00:03:02.810> like<00:03:03.050> they're<00:03:03.350> bad<00:03:03.590> people<00:03:03.640> no<00:03:04.640> it's

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
it's not like they're bad people no it's

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.580 
it's not like they're bad people no it's
just<00:03:05.210> that<00:03:05.450> they<00:03:05.750> just<00:03:06.020> can't<00:03:06.170> help<00:03:06.260> it<00:03:06.530> but

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
just that they just can't help it but

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.380 
just that they just can't help it but
they<00:03:07.400> just<00:03:07.430> need<00:03:07.700> to<00:03:07.730> be<00:03:07.820> aware<00:03:08.030> of<00:03:08.090> it<00:03:08.270> is<00:03:08.360> that

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
they just need to be aware of it is that

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.660 
they just need to be aware of it is that
right<00:03:08.600> be<00:03:09.290> absolutely<00:03:09.800> aware<00:03:09.980> of<00:03:10.190> it<00:03:10.370> and<00:03:10.520> then

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
right be absolutely aware of it and then

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.840 
right be absolutely aware of it and then
another<00:03:11.420> key<00:03:11.780> aspect<00:03:11.960> is<00:03:12.500> that<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.670> people

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
another key aspect is that the people

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.030 
another key aspect is that the people
that<00:03:14.060> are<00:03:14.090> really<00:03:14.420> good<00:03:14.600> with<00:03:14.780> conflict<00:03:15.410> they

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
that are really good with conflict they

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.670 
that are really good with conflict they
avoid<00:03:16.610> personal<00:03:17.270> attacks<00:03:17.750> and<00:03:18.140> character

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
avoid personal attacks and character

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.400 
avoid personal attacks and character
assassinations<00:03:19.670> and<00:03:20.140> generalizations<00:03:21.140> like

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
assassinations and generalizations like

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.610 
assassinations and generalizations like
Naomi<00:03:22.010> you<00:03:22.160> always<00:03:22.670> or<00:03:22.970> you<00:03:23.330> never<00:03:23.630> you<00:03:24.530> know

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
Naomi you always or you never you know

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:25.960 
Naomi you always or you never you know
because<00:03:24.890> when<00:03:25.010> you're<00:03:25.130> using<00:03:25.370> those<00:03:25.580> sorts<00:03:25.910> of

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
because when you're using those sorts of

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.140 
because when you're using those sorts of
words<00:03:26.260> you<00:03:27.260> get<00:03:27.410> on<00:03:27.500> the<00:03:27.590> defensive<00:03:28.100> and<00:03:28.280> and

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
words you get on the defensive and and

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.450 
words you get on the defensive and and
you<00:03:29.300> basically<00:03:29.480> strike<00:03:30.140> back<00:03:30.410> so<00:03:31.010> avoiding

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:31.460 
you basically strike back so avoiding

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.670 
you basically strike back so avoiding
those<00:03:31.790> sorts<00:03:32.210> of<00:03:32.300> terms<00:03:32.570> is<00:03:32.810> really<00:03:33.110> important

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
those sorts of terms is really important

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.080 
those sorts of terms is really important
then<00:03:34.490> one<00:03:34.880> of<00:03:34.910> the<00:03:35.060> keys<00:03:35.330> is<00:03:36.730> solving<00:03:37.730> an<00:03:37.880> issue

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
then one of the keys is solving an issue

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.810 
then one of the keys is solving an issue
as<00:03:38.420> a<00:03:38.480> team<00:03:38.810> so<00:03:39.050> you<00:03:39.680> bring<00:03:39.950> a<00:03:40.040> problem<00:03:40.250> to<00:03:40.400> the

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
as a team so you bring a problem to the

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.640 
as a team so you bring a problem to the
table<00:03:41.150> rather<00:03:41.750> than<00:03:41.900> saying<00:03:42.140> I<00:03:42.200> can't<00:03:42.410> believe

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
table rather than saying I can't believe

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.080 
table rather than saying I can't believe
you<00:03:42.740> got<00:03:42.920> us<00:03:43.070> into<00:03:43.280> that<00:03:43.430> place<00:03:43.670> Naomi

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
you got us into that place Naomi

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.490 
you got us into that place Naomi
couldn't<00:03:44.750> you<00:03:44.810> have<00:03:44.900> done<00:03:45.020> this<00:03:45.230> this<00:03:45.440> and

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
couldn't you have done this this and

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.430 
couldn't you have done this this and
this<00:03:45.680> why<00:03:46.610> is<00:03:46.670> it<00:03:46.850> always<00:03:47.000> my<00:03:47.270> fee<00:03:47.510> exactly<00:03:48.230> and

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
this why is it always my fee exactly and

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.420 
this why is it always my fee exactly and
then<00:03:48.530> you<00:03:48.590> start<00:03:48.860> playing<00:03:48.950> the<00:03:49.190> blame<00:03:49.370> game

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
then you start playing the blame game

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.040 
then you start playing the blame game
instead<00:03:50.180> of<00:03:50.210> doing<00:03:50.300> that<00:03:50.510> you<00:03:50.720> want<00:03:50.870> to<00:03:50.900> say

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
instead of doing that you want to say

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.570 
instead of doing that you want to say
here's<00:03:51.290> the<00:03:51.440> problem<00:03:51.710> what<00:03:52.160> do<00:03:52.220> you<00:03:52.310> think<00:03:52.490> we

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
here's the problem what do you think we

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.340 
here's the problem what do you think we
can<00:03:52.880> do<00:03:53.000> about<00:03:53.120> it<00:03:53.300> and<00:03:53.540> then<00:03:53.900> you'll<00:03:54.050> throw<00:03:54.290> it

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
can do about it and then you'll throw it

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:55.630 
can do about it and then you'll throw it
back<00:03:54.500> to<00:03:54.620> me<00:03:54.740> and<00:03:54.830> so<00:03:54.950> will<00:03:55.070> John<00:03:55.250> what<00:03:55.460> that

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
back to me and so will John what that

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.250 
back to me and so will John what that
they're<00:03:55.790> my<00:03:55.970> thoughts<00:03:56.210> what<00:03:56.420> do<00:03:56.480> you<00:03:56.570> think

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
they're my thoughts what do you think

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.660 
they're my thoughts what do you think
about<00:03:57.350> all<00:03:57.500> of<00:03:57.620> this<00:03:57.800> and<00:03:58.040> so<00:03:58.400> what<00:03:58.550> you're

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
about all of this and so what you're

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:59.890 
about all of this and so what you're
doing<00:03:58.700> is<00:03:59.000> you're<00:03:59.060> basically<00:03:59.600> working

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
doing is you're basically working

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.230 
doing is you're basically working
together<00:04:00.230> to<00:04:00.620> solve<00:04:00.860> the<00:04:01.460> problem<00:04:01.970> or<00:04:02.210> the

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.240 
together to solve the problem or the

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.690 
together to solve the problem or the
issue<00:04:02.510> or<00:04:03.470> the<00:04:03.560> conflict<00:04:04.040> rather<00:04:04.280> than

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
issue or the conflict rather than

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.750 
issue or the conflict rather than
pointing<00:04:05.360> fingers<00:04:05.990> and<00:04:06.200> you<00:04:07.130> know<00:04:07.250> going<00:04:07.460> back

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
pointing fingers and you know going back

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.420 
pointing fingers and you know going back
to<00:04:07.940> the<00:04:08.030> past<00:04:08.270> and<00:04:08.690> then<00:04:09.200> finally<00:04:09.740> the<00:04:10.130> people

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
to the past and then finally the people

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.130 
to the past and then finally the people
that<00:04:10.520> are<00:04:10.550> really<00:04:10.790> good<00:04:10.940> at<00:04:11.030> fighting<00:04:11.240> if

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
that are really good at fighting if

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.420 
that are really good at fighting if
things<00:04:12.590> do<00:04:12.950> escalate<00:04:13.730> they<00:04:15.430> excused

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
things do escalate they excused

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.789 
things do escalate they excused
themselves<00:04:16.870> take<00:04:17.870> a<00:04:17.900> bit<00:04:18.109> of<00:04:18.140> time<00:04:18.230> out<00:04:18.650> they

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
themselves take a bit of time out they

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.130 
themselves take a bit of time out they
might<00:04:18.950> go<00:04:19.100> to<00:04:19.160> another<00:04:19.400> room<00:04:19.900> Carmen<00:04:20.900> cells

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
might go to another room Carmen cells

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.290 
might go to another room Carmen cells
down<00:04:21.350> and<00:04:21.590> come<00:04:21.739> back<00:04:21.890> to<00:04:22.160> it<00:04:22.190> rather<00:04:23.060> than

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
down and come back to it rather than

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.090 
down and come back to it rather than
where<00:04:23.810> some<00:04:24.169> couples<00:04:24.590> they<00:04:24.710> just<00:04:24.950> keep

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
where some couples they just keep

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.160 
where some couples they just keep
escalating<00:04:25.400> and<00:04:26.060> then<00:04:26.150> you<00:04:26.270> get<00:04:26.390> throwing

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
escalating and then you get throwing

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.080 
escalating and then you get throwing
you<00:04:27.650> know<00:04:27.770> breaking<00:04:28.220> furniture<00:04:28.430> throwing

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
you know breaking furniture throwing

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.090 
you know breaking furniture throwing
things<00:04:29.390> and<00:04:29.660> you<00:04:30.200> just<00:04:30.230> get<00:04:30.560> into<00:04:30.800> a<00:04:30.830> place

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
things and you just get into a place

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.430 
things and you just get into a place
where<00:04:31.520> you<00:04:31.850> you<00:04:32.150> tend<00:04:32.600> to<00:04:32.720> feel<00:04:32.930> like<00:04:33.110> it<00:04:33.290> gets

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
where you you tend to feel like it gets

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.640 
where you you tend to feel like it gets
on<00:04:33.620> top<00:04:33.800> of<00:04:33.860> you<00:04:34.010> I<00:04:34.750> guess<00:04:35.750> finally<00:04:36.200> I<00:04:36.230> suppose

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
on top of you I guess finally I suppose

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.070 
on top of you I guess finally I suppose
remembering<00:04:37.490> why<00:04:37.700> you<00:04:38.030> love<00:04:38.240> the<00:04:38.390> person<00:04:38.420> and

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
remembering why you love the person and

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.590 
remembering why you love the person and
that<00:04:39.800> this<00:04:40.160> is<00:04:40.340> hopefully<00:04:41.030> just<00:04:41.180> a<00:04:41.360> minor

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
that this is hopefully just a minor

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.210 
that this is hopefully just a minor
issue<00:04:41.870> that<00:04:42.200> you're<00:04:42.320> arguing<00:04:42.710> right<00:04:42.800> yeah

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
issue that you're arguing right yeah

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.560 
issue that you're arguing right yeah
that's<00:04:43.490> right<00:04:43.700> and<00:04:43.970> keeping<00:04:44.390> it<00:04:44.480> in

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
that's right and keeping it in

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:45.910 
that's right and keeping it in
perspective<00:04:44.900> keeping<00:04:45.500> it<00:04:45.590> in<00:04:45.680> perspective

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:45.920 
perspective keeping it in perspective

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.000 
perspective keeping it in perspective
and<00:04:46.490> often<00:04:47.120> one<00:04:47.330> way<00:04:47.540> you<00:04:47.600> can<00:04:47.900> do<00:04:48.110> that<00:04:48.140> is<00:04:48.560> you

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
and often one way you can do that is you

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.890 
and often one way you can do that is you
can<00:04:49.190> say<00:04:49.400> to<00:04:49.460> yourself<00:04:49.970> after<00:04:50.270> you've<00:04:50.420> had<00:04:50.660> the

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
can say to yourself after you've had the

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.710 
can say to yourself after you've had the
the<00:04:51.770> argument<00:04:51.950> you've<00:04:52.430> got<00:04:52.670> some<00:04:52.970> resolution

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
the argument you've got some resolution

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.080 
the argument you've got some resolution
you<00:04:54.170> know<00:04:54.340> reminding<00:04:55.340> yourself<00:04:55.400> as<00:04:55.790> you<00:04:55.910> say

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
you know reminding yourself as you say

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.440 
you know reminding yourself as you say
what<00:04:56.300> do<00:04:56.360> I<00:04:56.450> like<00:04:56.690> about<00:04:56.720> this<00:04:57.200> person<00:04:57.530> and

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
what do I like about this person and

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.750 
what do I like about this person and
doing<00:04:59.450> something<00:05:00.110> that<00:05:00.500> actually<00:05:00.860> makes<00:05:01.520> the

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
doing something that actually makes the

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.970 
doing something that actually makes the
two<00:05:01.970> of<00:05:02.000> you<00:05:02.360> really<00:05:02.840> good<00:05:03.170> together<00:05:03.350> all<00:05:03.860> you

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
have to do is think back what what do we

do that makes us feel great it might be

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.250
