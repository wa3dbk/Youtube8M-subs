00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.230
 Love was called media and as you know 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:17.270
 I'm in Linz today and will be here 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.910
 luck we have here pagoda we 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.619
 Here are coconuts of young coconuts 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.779
 and they bought us right away 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.490
 and now I want to share with you like 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.470
 to the courses when will I come 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.630
 People often ask if you like the comedy coke 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.099
 is and thereby that here already one 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.140
 have made short video 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.130
 would like for the other coconut 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.840
 Of course I do not 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.340
 contain 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.320
 these coconuts the young coconuts 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.090
 have the advantage that they are special 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.589
 so tasty juice in the 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.269
 contrary to those also in 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:46.249
 quotes old coconuts with 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:48.050
 them with those with the brown solid 

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:50.300
 Shell has the advantage that you 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.309
 have a lot of juice and little 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.960
 and the meat with the firm 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:58.100
 a lot of flesh and little juice 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.480
 he says is really delicious very much 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.390
 nutritious with some countries even 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.150
 used as a substitute mother is 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.890
 really different ways to vitamins 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.030
 fat nose really very rich 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.229
 and I think just when you are little 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.900
 has children or in winter for themselves 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:14.420
 even to strengthen the perfect 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.799
 you do not get vitalization string 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.869
 Either way, you have good ones 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.960
 nearby asians or man 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.909
 ordered via internet can itself 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.939
 All groups of mail order companies too 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.740
 order today so I have, by the way 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:31.159
 my private cameraman has 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.600
 damn it yes and now I want 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.680
 imagine two possibilities as 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.180
 also make them to have a 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.969
 possibility is the me now too 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.619
 honestly just to hear that 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:41.479
 knew and now only in winter some 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.520
 I have used it I hope it works 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.719
 Everything is good and the other variant is 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.280
 the if you keep a razor hackebeil 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:48.259
 So I do not have you now 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.030
 first the first variant what you 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.290
 needs is really very stable then 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.800
 knife 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.600
 Ceramic knife is suitable for this 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.310
 Facts really not 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.950
 then you really need a stable one 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.430
 Supplement where you only if if against 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.610
 heavy 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.320
 but nothing breaks so if you have the 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.020
 Coconuts even at sea forbidden what 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.220
 Most of the time they happen and had 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.440
 as this flat spot and up here 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.300
 this tip and now makes in principle 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.590
 nothing else than that with force 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.660
 here about the against house and then me 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.930
 do that then even more dollars here then 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.990
 went up the top roof and then 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.220
 you can open it as why a 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.780
 bottles cover much I tried it 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.490
 stay tuned and do it now 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.930
 It's important to you that you do not have to 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.330
 so not only does that strike you down 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.250
 tip because then you do not come to that 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.310
 so the points are nice and big 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:45.650
 a bit more than half 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:48.530
 So do not bother me anymore 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.180
 for all those who have earth or stress 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.590
 I wait I buy a pagoda and leave 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.730
 the butter this ban is out there 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.950
 Of course, which one is better than that 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:04.070
 i but i think health insurance companies here 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.900
 I have here I passing again 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.299
 I do not want to know 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.549
 I would say that you have me now 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.260
 mistook a hole here book music 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.760
 me the book farthest this soft pro 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.160
 maybe the book is from the pagoda 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.420
 really soft and tender and now 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.459
 a look rather cameraman you can 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.260
 you can do that you can see you coming 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:25.970
 that's full to the top 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.100
 absolutely delicious juice is not 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.940
 delicious to believe that's something of 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:34.340
 delicious and drink the heat afterwards 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.340
 So I have to search a container 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.459
 can you then say yes at the 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.630
 a sled and with the spoon you can 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.860
 you then if you still made it big 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:47.390
 Have the flesh out of fear of him 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.640
 but also my stream in advance in the 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.560
 juice so that this thing in common 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.000
 method january them now as I said the 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.850
 Do not use things in methods 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.790
 apply 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.530
 again no hate or not wanting 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.610
 I still want you there now 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.050
 short the method I show 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.450
 have done for years because I was so one 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.820
 knife does not have and indeed it is in the 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.520
 basically a round coconut as well 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.900
 these are the lawson invite know and to participate in 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.280
 these and part of it to come and to 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.920
 those three holes of those times 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.240
 You must have spoken this here 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.160
 scrape 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:21.570
 so now I do most of that 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.880
 It's really easy to do that 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.230
 I do that a bit now track 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.520
 then the video continues that with not 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.040
 all the time has to look and how 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.580
 which then looks if that is queried 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.920
 all over 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.190
 I'll show you the second one right away 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.300
 part okay so what on my own what 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.620
 I still now you have seen me 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.050
 I've got a bit of a break here now 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.750
 hot sauce basically you just 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.700
 In principle, you can do everything here 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:48.750
 Now it happens so this 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:50.370
 Coconut thought the other focus three 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.770
 has holes and specifically of these three 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.030
 fan is especially rich because it needs 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.440
 one only does not always do that now 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.230
 not finished because you need then only 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.860
 quite knack pixel around to the juice 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.570
 ranzukommen 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.950
 So you see , here's the one 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.800
 third and probably still and that's it 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.550
 very soft hole yes and there you go 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.070
 just pure 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.560
 the clou is the thing when you are 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.660
 short course here we have the tip 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:16.920
 the coconut is made on and off of 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:19.110
 Top off juice to the departure in this 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.550
 method I have the tip here 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.350
 there is the hole mostly at this 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.850
 flat place so try then 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.110
 namely at the top of these 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.270
 but you can not find three germany 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.890
 because she is always down so if you are 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.390
 that still considering then you need 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.010
 not looking and in vain somewhere around 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.230
 press and then maybe with 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.250
 hammer and nail act exactly like that 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.110
 still the type I'm doing here now 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.550
 continue and create one here 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.820
 and we'll see you soon 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:43.620
 if I have abolished everything so now 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.030
 you see, I did everything 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.270
 I also mackel this profession the chicken 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:49.890
 kind of small on how I said here is 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.810
 the lower part of tourism is here 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.100
 the top with the tip and that have 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.930
 I'm good at these three holes here 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.560
 recognize here are still there are still there 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.450
 his hole 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.010
 you basically do nothing but do it 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.389
 to take a sharp object 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.639
 but be careful that the coconut is straight 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:05.160
 Do you think you need it without much 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:07.080
 It's just an athlete's pressure 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:10.190
 so far , but only a single hole 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:15.630
 water is soft so soft that you can 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:17.940
 Sting like this and then you can 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:20.850
 Now pour the liquid off 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.710
 or the straw I drink now 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:25.650
 would recommend if you are there 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:27.540
 of course you want to stay tuned 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.610
 have now of course the kind of 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.200
 So just go back out 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.419
 follow on the floor and until they are 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.669
 apart works apart and breaks apart 

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:37.440
 then you can dice the flesh 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:39.540
 which of course is now more likely to 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.790
 time-consuming and dirty hre 

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:43.710
 variant as I said easier it is 

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:46.320
 becomes a job knife or chopper 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:48.870
 dennis like this big enough around here 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.940
 chop liquid you come great 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:52.169
 ran synonymous without problems then that 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:57.030
 whole damage is a clean one 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:59.789
 thing and not quite as elaborate this 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:01.020
 that other okay that thinks I was 

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:03.780
 then for today, I hope so 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:06.180
 could you animate that again 

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:08.310
 with her with the pomegranate that always 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.780
 come back on and you with this but 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:11.880
 handlebar one fruit sets apart 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.800
 and not so much fear and stuff 

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:15.630
 many question marks and if ever 

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.760
 this book dares okay that's me 

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:20.750
 from linz to the next video me 

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.750
 wish you something is good
