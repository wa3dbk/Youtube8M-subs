 light shade at all such a cream 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:46.949
 there are only a few shades 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:51.210
 13 21 23 and in my opinion already 30 which is not 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:54.300
 I remember exactly the most running shades 21 23 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.760
 13 too white too light for 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.109

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:03.239

 I'll show you what this language looks like in 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.280
 Overall, this is quite interesting 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:18.600
 the pin itself cream looks like this 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:25.800
 way he has a pump but such that 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:28.200
 very convenient volume of 50 milliliters 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.530
 here he stands 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.080
 I ordered it 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.690
 dollars for thirteen fourteen 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.670
 maybe 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.159
 that is, why am I like that? 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.840
 we sell in principle in various 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.560
 stores where Asian is for sale 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.720
 cosmetics 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.520
 I decided to order it directly from 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:50.350
 seller and more likely to certainly not 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:53.500
 tearing on a fake actually what 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.380
 bibi cream baby krell is not normal 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.530
 some kind of foundation this tool 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.050
 which was created by germany in order 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:06.179
 so after some clean face 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:09.910
 set the skin ie it is 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:13.510
 enough so let's say it is 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.519
 means that is not applied to the cream on 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.290
 clean skin that is an ordinary flashlight 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.630
 on first use cream then already 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.970
 on top of the foundation here is impossible 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:26.769
 use scream under it because 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.290
 here this bibi cream will play on it and 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:32.319
 Graham's own billi contains himself and 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.060
 moisturizing and nutrition and skin treatment then 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.640
 there is it is not just decorative 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:41.170
 Cosmetics precisely here enough too 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.430
 medical, that is, well, in principle, the reasons 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.650
 the device is not the first time of course 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.750
 manifest need to use but 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.660
 maybe about a month 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.410
 this tool can even be more to 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.239
 see some specific result 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.930
 they say that it saves traces there 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:03.400
 post acne and such acne too 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:06.820
 relieves here it means in this cream there 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.640
 having had 42 which is very good for use 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:14.769
 its summer protects from ultraviolet 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:17.799
 radiation is a very big factor having time that 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:20.180
 I want to mention exactly the means such 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:22.040

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.590
 and they are almost invisible and they are not 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.959

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.299

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:39.859
 blends in with your face 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:44.510

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:01.189
 such curves were used 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:05.180
 almost all women are girls and they have 

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:08.120
 remarkably smooth skin it is enough 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.780

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.870

 precisely all sorts of different traces from 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.959
 pimples and to disguise them then 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:20.180
 eat you don't need concealer can 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:25.490
 say that it is a cream foundation 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:27.229

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:44.610

 that is, I have a video was he 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.990

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.180
 hydrophilic oil and facial wash 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.680

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.400
 again bibi cream 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.289
 It is by these means in general that if 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.400
 you will just shoot our usual 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:04.860
 washing gels 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.750
 cream you for the version of the pores and you will have 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.389

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:18.000
 that bibi cream he say so stronger 

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:20.639
 is the skin with the line merges with it 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.979
 its harder to wash off is not easy 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:27.569
 foundation something more dense is 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:31.680
 tool here as well the seller who 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:34.590
 sent me a kind of cream sent a few 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.120
 probnichkov also means different 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.630
 this remedy for less 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:43.199
 super aqua here such probnichek 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:44.849
 it is a facial wash too 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:48.779
 Asian precisely from Misha 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:51.240
 I have not tried and and so far 

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:53.310
 just read it here but this too 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.099
 something like that to the hada remedy 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:59.180
 labo and so on here these are from shiseido 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:01.889
 perfect you just foam creams 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.319
 The following means for some reason on the seller 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:06.870
 probably thought that I was a woman 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:09.509
 old age and sent me everything 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:12.449
 means for some reason it is for age 

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:14.600
 skin in general is such a night serum 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:17.900
 sulfur knife 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:22.060
 which is recommended to use morning 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:26.000
 9 years old here is such a night 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:28.850
 our sulfur and means the next probe 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.840
 this is also for aged skin 

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:38.120
 luxury beat cream called he sydney 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:41.300
 what spf30 7 here is also so small 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:44.480
 probnichek also have not tried here in 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:46.730
 In general, Russia does not advise buying 

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:49.430
 This led cream because you can 

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:52.310
 run into a fake well, secondly, they 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.180
 cost us much more expensive that is if 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:58.010
 such a gene 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:07:01.430
 rubles for 400 can be ordered on ebay then 

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:04.220
 we have Russia such baby grass well, somewhere 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:06.620
 around 900 rubles will cost of course 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:08.390
 it's not very profitable, and for 900 rubles 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:14.360
 can you welcome a nice suite 

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:17.660
 buy here in general, then my opinion and conclusion 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.800
 of all this first cream 

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:22.780
 really well tuned 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:25.580
 By the way, even under the face under your tone and 

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:27.860
 for example, but not climbed and gives yellow or 

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.930
 bro fill there is still color but you do not 

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:32.120
 shade fits very hard to find and 

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:34.910
 you need to mix this means she 

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:37.010
 adapts to any color well, in general 

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:40.520
 That is very very cool looks 

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:43.190
 this is not visible she masks enough 

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:46.310
 such strong marks from some pimples 

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:48.320
 and also heals them, but here’s how 

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:49.680
 It announced yet this did not depend 

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:53.729
 effect but stated 

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:55.350
 so I think I'll be like that in general 

00:07:53.729 --> 00:07:57.720
 then the funds are very interesting 

00:07:55.350 --> 00:08:00.810
 that's just the beginning to use it 

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:02.610
 it is the people's first opinion here well 

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:06.060
 thank you very much for watching 

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:08.570
 see you in the next video everyone until 

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.570
 new meetings
