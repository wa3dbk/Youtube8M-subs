00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
it is created just goes straight to the

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.939 
it is created just goes straight to the
left<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.270> off<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.719> screen<00:00:52.050> with<00:00:52.739> these

left and off the screen with these

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.040 
left and off the screen with these
bullets<00:00:53.370> however<00:00:53.760> we<00:00:54.030> want<00:00:54.329> them<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.539> actually

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
bullets however we want them to actually

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.840 
bullets however we want them to actually
find<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.559> position<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.250> player<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.760> then

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
find the position of the player and then

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.760 
find the position of the player and then
shoot<00:00:57.149> towards<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.840> player<00:00:58.050> wherever<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.680> is

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
shoot towards the player wherever it is

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.830 
shoot towards the player wherever it is
on<00:00:58.949> screen<00:00:59.399> you<00:01:00.000> might<00:01:00.120> be<00:01:00.270> thinking<00:01:00.570> then<00:01:00.690> if

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
on screen you might be thinking then if

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.630 
on screen you might be thinking then if
we<00:01:00.930> make<00:01:01.109> this<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.289> child<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.250> object

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
we make this a child of the object

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.250 
we make this a child of the object
bullet<00:01:02.969> it's<00:01:03.480> going<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.809> inherit<00:01:04.229> that

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
bullet it's going to inherit that

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.020 
bullet it's going to inherit that
movement<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.070> just<00:01:05.549> go<00:01:05.640> straight<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.909> the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
movement and just go straight to the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.390 
movement and just go straight to the
left<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:06.930> why<00:01:07.049> would<00:01:07.229> we<00:01:07.320> do<00:01:07.470> this<00:01:07.619> well<00:01:07.860> really

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
left so why would we do this well really

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.850 
left so why would we do this well really
all<00:01:08.549> we're<00:01:08.729> doing<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.270> getting<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:10.110> outside

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
all we're doing is getting the outside

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.789 
all we're doing is getting the outside
room<00:01:11.580> destroy<00:01:12.510> itself<00:01:12.869> function<00:01:13.530> we<00:01:13.650> can

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
room destroy itself function we can

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.990 
room destroy itself function we can

to duplicate that event here so we can

to duplicate that event here so we can

the object cannon the firing mechanism

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.300 
the object cannon the firing mechanism
is<00:02:24.659> going<00:02:24.900> to<00:02:25.019> be<00:02:25.170> pretty<00:02:25.469> similar<00:02:25.829> to<00:02:26.189> what

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
is going to be pretty similar to what

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.860 
is going to be pretty similar to what
we've<00:02:26.459> already<00:02:26.579> done<00:02:27.000> but<00:02:27.510> slightly

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
we've already done but slightly

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.679 
we've already done but slightly
different<00:02:28.219> so<00:02:29.219> let's<00:02:29.400> go<00:02:29.519> to<00:02:29.609> control<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.180> set

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:30.689 
different so let's go to control and set

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:33.110 
different so let's go to control and set
variable<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.349> drag<00:02:32.069> it<00:02:32.220> above<00:02:32.370> this<00:02:32.790> set

variable and drag it above this set
angle<00:02:33.359> comment<00:02:34.010> and<00:02:35.780> the<00:02:36.780> variable<00:02:37.230> is<00:02:37.319> going

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:37.439 
angle comment and the variable is going

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:40.670 
angle comment and the variable is going

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
to be is underscore firing and instead

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.890 
to be is underscore firing and instead
of<00:02:40.739> false<00:02:41.129> this<00:02:41.549> time<00:02:41.849> we're<00:02:42.359> going<00:02:42.569> to<00:02:42.659> start

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
of false this time we're going to start

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.580 
of false this time we're going to start
out<00:02:43.079> with<00:02:43.349> it<00:02:43.709> saying<00:02:43.980> true<00:02:44.900> which<00:02:45.900> means<00:02:45.930> that

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
out with it saying true which means that

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.089 
out with it saying true which means that
it<00:02:47.010> will<00:02:47.549> not<00:02:47.700> be<00:02:47.760> able<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.239> fire<00:02:48.510> and<00:02:49.099> the

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
it will not be able to fire and the

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.039 
it will not be able to fire and the
reason<00:02:50.400> we're<00:02:50.549> doing<00:02:50.579> that<00:02:50.909> is<00:02:51.090> because<00:02:51.359> the

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
reason we're doing that is because the

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.050 
reason we're doing that is because the

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:55.919 
bit of time to get on screen we don't

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:57.710 
bit of time to get on screen we don't
want<00:02:56.129> the<00:02:56.370> cannons<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:56.970> be<00:02:57.060> able<00:02:57.269> to<00:02:57.359> shoot<00:02:57.540> at

so it doesn't fire and then we'll set

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.069

firing mechanism in the step event just

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.089 
firing mechanism in the step event just
like<00:04:03.180> always<00:04:03.510> first<00:04:04.470> we'll<00:04:04.680> test<00:04:04.829> for<00:04:05.069> a

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
like always first we'll test for a

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
variable is firing to true

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.310 
variable is firing to true
come<00:04:22.620> to<00:04:22.770> the<00:04:22.920> main<00:04:23.340> one<00:04:23.550> tab<00:04:23.850> and<00:04:24.320> create

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
come to the main one tab and create

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.210 
come to the main one tab and create
instance<00:04:26.450> we<00:04:27.450> want<00:04:27.600> to<00:04:27.810> create<00:04:28.230> this<00:04:28.740> object

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
instance we want to create this object

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.720 
instance we want to create this object
boss<00:04:29.880> bullet<00:04:30.360> at<00:04:30.540> the<00:04:31.320> origin<00:04:31.770> point<00:04:31.800> set<00:04:32.610> to

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
boss bullet at the origin point set to

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.010 
boss bullet at the origin point set to
relative<00:04:33.180> of<00:04:33.960> our<00:04:34.050> cannon<00:04:34.530> and<00:04:35.720> then<00:04:36.720> we<00:04:36.870> need

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
relative of our cannon and then we need

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.960 
relative of our cannon and then we need
to<00:04:37.050> reset<00:04:37.500> our<00:04:37.710> alarm<00:04:38.130> again<00:04:38.430> so<00:04:38.640> come<00:04:38.850> back

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
to reset our alarm again so come back

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.930 
to reset our alarm again so come back
domain<00:04:39.300> to<00:04:39.510> set<00:04:40.020> alarm<00:04:40.380> and<00:04:40.980> we're<00:04:41.790> going<00:04:41.910> to

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
domain to set alarm and we're going to

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.220 
domain to set alarm and we're going to
set<00:04:42.150> this<00:04:42.300> to<00:04:42.360> you<00:04:42.630> choose<00:04:44.510> parentheses<00:04:45.510> 30

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
set this to you choose parentheses 30

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.500 
set this to you choose parentheses 30
comma<00:04:47.360> 45<00:04:48.360> comma<00:04:49.070> 60<00:04:50.070> close<00:04:50.400> parentheses<00:04:50.970> so

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
comma 45 comma 60 close parentheses so

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.110 
comma 45 comma 60 close parentheses so
again<00:04:51.750> we're<00:04:51.990> giving<00:04:52.320> it<00:04:52.470> a<00:04:52.680> random<00:04:52.950> reset<00:04:53.670> so

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
again we're giving it a random reset so

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.750 
again we're giving it a random reset so
that<00:04:54.360> the<00:04:54.660> firing<00:04:55.110> is<00:04:55.320> staggered<00:04:56.040> and<00:04:56.280> this

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
that the firing is staggered and this

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.940 
that the firing is staggered and this
isn't<00:04:57.030> a<00:04:57.270> huge<00:04:57.540> barrage<00:04:57.990> of<00:04:58.290> bullets<00:04:58.530> coming

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
isn't a huge barrage of bullets coming

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.660 
isn't a huge barrage of bullets coming
towards<00:04:59.310> the<00:04:59.430> player<00:05:00.290> click<00:05:01.290> OK<00:05:01.620> and<00:05:01.860> we<00:05:02.520> can

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:02.670 
towards the player click OK and we can

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.610 
towards the player click OK and we can
close<00:05:02.910> the<00:05:03.090> object<00:05:03.450> cannon<00:05:03.840> and<00:05:03.960> it<00:05:04.380> should

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
close the object cannon and it should

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.410 
close the object cannon and it should
work<00:05:04.980> so<00:05:05.010> let's<00:05:05.460> run<00:05:05.610> it<00:05:07.550> comes<00:05:08.550> on<00:05:08.700> screen<00:05:08.940> and

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:09.420 
work so let's run it comes on screen and

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.570 
work so let's run it comes on screen and
it<00:05:09.870> begins<00:05:10.080> firing<00:05:10.410> and<00:05:10.950> they<00:05:11.070> fire<00:05:11.280> towards

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
it begins firing and they fire towards

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.840 
it begins firing and they fire towards
the<00:05:11.670> player<00:05:11.880> if<00:05:12.060> I<00:05:12.150> move<00:05:12.330> the<00:05:12.420> player<00:05:13.850> can

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
the player if I move the player can

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:20.930 
the player if I move the player can
start<00:05:15.180> shooting<00:05:15.360> towards<00:05:15.840> it<00:05:17.780> ok<00:05:19.760> so<00:05:20.760> that's

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
start shooting towards it ok so that's

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.520 
start shooting towards it ok so that's
the<00:05:21.090> first<00:05:21.300> part<00:05:21.540> of<00:05:21.660> the<00:05:21.750> boss<00:05:21.900> the<00:05:22.170> second

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
the first part of the boss the second

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.100 
the first part of the boss the second
part<00:05:22.770> is<00:05:23.040> being<00:05:23.550> able<00:05:23.730> to<00:05:23.940> shoot<00:05:24.480> and<00:05:24.750> destroy

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
part is being able to shoot and destroy

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.750 
part is being able to shoot and destroy
the<00:05:25.260> cannons<00:05:25.710> which<00:05:25.950> will<00:05:26.160> then<00:05:26.280> destroy<00:05:26.640> the

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
the cannons which will then destroy the

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.520 
the cannons which will then destroy the
boss<00:05:26.940> itself<00:05:27.420> so<00:05:27.690> we'll<00:05:27.810> set<00:05:27.990> that<00:05:28.020> up<00:05:28.200> in<00:05:28.440> the

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
boss itself so we'll set that up in the

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.860 
boss itself so we'll set that up in the
next<00:05:28.560> video
