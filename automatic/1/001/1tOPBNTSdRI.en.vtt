if you're going to do aerobic exercises

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.170 
if you're going to do aerobic exercises
it's<00:01:49.950> good<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.220> do<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.460> right<00:01:50.820> when<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.060> get

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
it's good to do it right when you get

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.700 
it's good to do it right when you get
out<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.329> bed<00:01:51.509> in<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.659> morning<00:01:51.930> before<00:01:52.079> ye<00:01:52.409> and

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
out of bed in the morning before ye and

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.490 
out of bed in the morning before ye and
that<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:54.149> true<00:01:54.180> but<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:55.079> have<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.380> be

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
that that is true but you have to be

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.980 
that that is true but you have to be
careful<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:57.090> reason<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.420> works<00:01:57.750> is

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
careful you the reason that works is

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.230 
careful you the reason that works is
your<00:01:58.560> body<00:01:58.770> uses<00:01:59.070> its<00:01:59.399> glycogen<00:01:59.820> stores

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
your body uses its glycogen stores

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.760 
your body uses its glycogen stores
overnight<00:02:00.750> or<00:02:01.020> you're<00:02:01.170> sleeping<00:02:01.649> because

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
overnight or you're sleeping because

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.459 
overnight or you're sleeping because
you're<00:02:01.950> fasting<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:03.479> when<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.140> exercise

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
you're fasting and so when you exercise

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.649 
you're fasting and so when you exercise
it<00:02:04.979> doesn't<00:02:05.219> have<00:02:05.340> this

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
it doesn't have this

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.589 
it doesn't have this
the<00:02:05.899> burn<00:02:06.170> so<00:02:06.920> it<00:02:07.100> burns<00:02:07.460> fat<00:02:07.850> but<00:02:08.119> it<00:02:08.420> will

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
the burn so it burns fat but it will

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.630 
the burn so it burns fat but it will
also<00:02:08.840> burn<00:02:09.229> muscle<00:02:09.500> in<00:02:09.769> that<00:02:09.920> situation<00:02:10.369> you

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
also burn muscle in that situation you

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.910 
also burn muscle in that situation you
definitely<00:02:11.120> don't<00:02:11.180> want<00:02:11.360> to<00:02:11.420> do<00:02:11.540> that<00:02:11.599> and<00:02:12.050> so

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
definitely don't want to do that and so

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.320 
definitely don't want to do that and so
if<00:02:13.069> you're<00:02:13.190> going<00:02:13.340> to<00:02:13.400> do<00:02:13.489> aerobic<00:02:13.879> exercises

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:24.870 
sugar in any form it's going to burn
that<00:05:23.410> sugar<00:05:23.740> it's<00:05:24.070> not<00:05:24.340> going<00:05:24.490> to<00:05:24.580> dip<00:05:24.760> into

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
that sugar it's not going to dip into

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.250 
that sugar it's not going to dip into
the<00:05:25.060> fat<00:05:25.300> so<00:05:27.090> the<00:05:28.090> whey<00:05:28.660> protein<00:05:29.080> is<00:05:29.170> essential

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
the fat so the whey protein is essential

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.250 
the fat so the whey protein is essential
I<00:05:29.890> also<00:05:30.640> feel<00:05:31.060> it<00:05:31.240> casein<00:05:31.690> protein<00:05:32.080> which<00:05:32.230> is

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
I also feel it casein protein which is

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.890 
I also feel it casein protein which is
the<00:05:32.470> slower<00:05:32.740> digesting<00:05:32.970> milk<00:05:33.970> protein<00:05:34.420> is

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
the slower digesting milk protein is

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.020 
the slower digesting milk protein is
great<00:05:35.740> it's<00:05:36.070> great<00:05:36.220> for<00:05:36.430> the<00:05:36.550> evening<00:05:36.730> it

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030

digesting<00:05:40.990> casein<00:05:41.710> is<00:05:41.860> slow<00:05:42.070> digesting<00:05:42.760> and

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
digesting casein is slow digesting and

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.730
