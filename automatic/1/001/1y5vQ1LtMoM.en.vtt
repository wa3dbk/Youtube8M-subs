00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:03.480
 you 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.770
 I'm still there we still find but I'm happy with my 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:08.399
 chrono 

00:00:08.399 --> 00:00:11.399
 for this time I show you the alliance mode 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:15.949
 so the ion model happens in two rounds 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.189
 with three teams of two 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:21.469
 so in fact I have to kill for the moment where the characters do 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.060
 the two glass characters on the map 

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:29.339
 and you know dollars during a retreat two more people are here to 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:32.339
 to kill me 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.410
 the sleeve 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.160
 11:30 p.m. 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.330
 if the game is played in two rounds 204 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.940
 child focus 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.860
 for once I came back to kill yet everything starts me I'm 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.860
 always the same person is always done by the same people 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.170
 so percent for the ballerina liga surprise come from the mode 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.159
 I am sad for him six months 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.200
 steve jobs his party crowd charleroi still to do 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.130
 q - toulalan l 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.740
 what for you this superb 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.840
 we fight 20 years old and hopper 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.130
 the problem is I do not have I'm just right 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.680
 we must create 2 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.110
 to take care of it after having it 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.110
 to enter two more people need more also 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.580
 and that's it, and I took the opportunity to kill someone to kill him 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.140
 ah yes as I did not want to say a good one we will not see very well what the 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.110
 picture quality is not great but when I'm someone who wins 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.240
 experience points they tell me how many boxes percentage more 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.940
 of 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.130
 what percentage of the year 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.899
 angela merkel would have liked my work colleague before 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.799
 there is also 

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:24.259
 good my colleague did the job before at least I had spotted the other 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:31.889
 so I think it could lead the fed how long they do not 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:35.299
 earn less than 20 minutes later 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.979
 since it is to improve the quality 

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:39.799
 he was thrilled 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.649
 on ps3 sure it must happen again 

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:46.239
 I can not wait to get to ps3 which is superfluous sherpa if I am 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.239
 flattered eiffel or what 

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:52.919
 toulouse 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:55.919
 you still see the game the only thing is that you can not 

00:02:56.969 --> 00:02:59.969
 you do not see what is written on 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.010
 of this islet to make an announcement that it deprives someone against you 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.609
 that's how to turn off the microphone of that person with whom I play 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.290
 because during the phases wait charest to whoever wants to hear it and 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.159
 I can not disable it but I do not know if it's good what if 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:19.950
 someone with a clear drop 3 and stand well helped up to 5 points 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:21.289
 who read me 

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:24.279
 red and a dog handler 

00:03:24.279 --> 00:03:26.239
 josy dubiÃ© to show 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.809
 the giantists 

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:29.359
 here is the Thursday lunch 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:32.359
 however points 

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:36.529
 that's for sure and it's humiliating the wayne person who sat in heaven and earth 

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:39.529
 she 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:50.939
 the first run on thirty seconds 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:02.649
 for that we can say that we no longer need to be wary of everyone 

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:04.989
 said we already know what people who can 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:06.219
 kill 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:09.149
 as for advertising disguise I have no money but 

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:12.659
 I use the fast race the flexibility disguises have made of 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:13.869
 even 

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:15.589
 but everything changes shape 

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:17.889
 so 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:19.099
 there so 

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:22.099
 the person who came to us to kill pink in the center something else 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:28.180
 banks training margin that's going to change I'm going to have to kill the little ones 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.349
 tunes 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:32.310
 the moment 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.310
 it's the killers have opened who can kill us 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:56.430
 the part is not included 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.430
 I wish someone who such assignment 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:05.400
 we wait a few seconds 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.360
 because the party does not start that because we're talking to you, you'll have a 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.360
 in any case 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.110
 well yes we have a crew of 4 5 m-- contains 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.800

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:30.209
 not like on all of the people locked up allah this idea 

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:33.839
 it's a touchdown in a corner 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.210
 ben 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.210
 6 

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:44.879

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:11.660
