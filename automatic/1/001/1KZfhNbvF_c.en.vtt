yeah pretty cool we need to mount this
flapper<00:02:55.290> here<00:02:58.250> somehow<00:03:00.020> I'll<00:03:01.020> probably<00:03:01.320> just

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
flapper here somehow I'll probably just

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.950 
flapper here somehow I'll probably just
drill<00:03:02.040> a<00:03:02.070> pin<00:03:02.580> right<00:03:02.880> through<00:03:03.330> that<00:03:03.360> corner

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
drill a pin right through that corner

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.470 
drill a pin right through that corner
right<00:03:04.170> there<00:03:07.040> and<00:03:08.040> then<00:03:08.520> have<00:03:08.910> it<00:03:08.940> so<00:03:09.300> this

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
right there and then have it so this

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:20.750 
right there and then have it so this
tangle<00:03:11.540> swing<00:03:12.540> back<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:12.870> forth<00:03:19.490> and<00:03:20.490> that's

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
tangle swing back and forth and that's

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.340 
tangle swing back and forth and that's
the<00:03:21.000> oil<00:03:21.150> burner<00:03:23.150> one<00:03:24.150> project<00:03:24.810> done<00:03:25.050> now<00:03:25.320> I
