00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
impressive thing about the BK 2 is that

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:37.679

to the pommel this is designed to take
abuse<00:01:40.979> factory<00:01:41.979> edge<00:01:42.069> is<00:01:42.220> pretty<00:01:42.399> rough<00:01:42.759> so

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
abuse factory edge is pretty rough so

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.429 
abuse factory edge is pretty rough so
I'm<00:01:43.420> cutting<00:01:43.599> through<00:01:43.840> this<00:01:43.929> paper<00:01:44.140> I'm

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
I'm cutting through this paper I'm

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:46.230 
I'm cutting through this paper I'm
actually<00:01:44.590> having<00:01:44.860> a<00:01:45.069> saw<00:01:45.369> through<00:01:45.909> it<00:01:45.939> with

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
actually having a saw through it with

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.199 
actually having a saw through it with
the<00:01:46.360> blade<00:01:46.630> you<00:01:47.500> can<00:01:47.679> hear<00:01:48.189> it<00:01:48.429> actually<00:01:48.880> tear

00:01:49.199 --> 00:01:49.209 
the blade you can hear it actually tear

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:52.320 
the blade you can hear it actually tear
through<00:01:49.479> the<00:01:49.659> fibers<00:01:50.189> it's<00:01:51.189> cutting<00:01:51.759> but<00:01:52.299> I

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
through the fibers it's cutting but I

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.539 
through the fibers it's cutting but I
can't<00:01:52.659> just<00:01:52.869> push<00:01:53.110> cut<00:01:53.380> through<00:01:53.709> it<00:01:53.890> there's<00:01:54.490> a

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
can't just push cut through it there's a

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.050 
can't just push cut through it there's a
reason<00:01:55.000> for<00:01:55.149> this<00:01:55.299> this<00:01:56.140> has<00:01:56.470> a<00:01:56.770> utility<00:01:57.520> only

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
reason for this this has a utility only

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.779 
reason for this this has a utility only
edge<00:01:58.299> from<00:01:58.899> the<00:01:59.079> factory<00:01:59.560> you<00:02:00.250> can<00:02:00.369> see<00:02:00.579> right

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
edge from the factory you can see right

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:03.870 
edge from the factory you can see right
here<00:02:00.849> all<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:01.990> serrations<00:02:02.470> on<00:02:02.979> the<00:02:03.579> blade

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
here all the serrations on the blade

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.309 
here all the serrations on the blade
itself<00:02:04.209> just<00:02:04.569> from<00:02:04.720> the<00:02:04.810> grinding<00:02:05.170> process

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:05.319 
itself just from the grinding process

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:08.370 
itself just from the grinding process
it's<00:02:05.799> not<00:02:06.069> polished<00:02:06.759> and<00:02:07.000> those<00:02:07.750> little

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
it's not polished and those little

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.610 
it's not polished and those little
serrations<00:02:08.829> are<00:02:09.450> actually<00:02:10.450> very<00:02:11.049> good<00:02:11.410> at

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
serrations are actually very good at

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.680 
serrations are actually very good at
cutting<00:02:11.980> fibres<00:02:12.519> like<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.239> collagen<00:02:13.660> fibers

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
cutting fibres like the collagen fibers

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.530 
cutting fibres like the collagen fibers

in this tan deer hide I got caught on

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.970 
in this tan deer hide I got caught on

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
the back edge of the blade there but I'm

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.979

his<00:04:50.430> work<00:04:50.670> and<00:04:50.970> I<00:04:51.840> just<00:04:52.080> took<00:04:52.230> this<00:04:52.380> belt<00:04:52.740> off

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
his work and I just took this belt off

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.980 
his work and I just took this belt off
flipped<00:04:53.490> it<00:04:53.610> around<00:04:53.700> to<00:04:54.000> the<00:04:54.060> backside<00:04:54.360> and

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
flipped it around to the backside and

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.430 
flipped it around to the backside and
I'm<00:04:55.440> giving<00:04:55.830> it<00:04:55.950> 9<00:04:56.280> pairs<00:04:56.850> of<00:04:57.180> strokes<00:04:57.750> to

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
I'm giving it 9 pairs of strokes to

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.190 
I'm giving it 9 pairs of strokes to
strop<00:04:58.890> the<00:04:59.160> edge<00:04:59.370> this<00:05:00.150> is<00:05:00.360> the<00:05:00.510> only<00:05:00.810> thing

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
strop the edge this is the only thing

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.620 
strop the edge this is the only thing
that<00:05:01.410> I've<00:05:01.530> done<00:05:01.830> to<00:05:02.400> the<00:05:02.520> edge<00:05:02.700> at<00:05:03.000> all<00:05:03.210> since

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
that I've done to the edge at all since

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.510 
that I've done to the edge at all since
taking<00:05:04.050> it<00:05:04.170> out<00:05:04.320> of<00:05:04.350> the<00:05:04.560> box<00:05:04.800> you're<00:05:05.100> looking

taking it out of the box you're looking

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.570 
taking it out of the box you're looking
at<00:05:05.670> it<00:05:05.790> right<00:05:06.060> here<00:05:06.920> and<00:05:07.920> what<00:05:08.100> do<00:05:08.160> you<00:05:08.220> see<00:05:08.430> the

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
at it right here and what do you see the

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.940 
at it right here and what do you see the
difference<00:05:08.970> that<00:05:09.150> this<00:05:09.300> dropping<00:05:09.900> makes<00:05:10.200> that

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
difference that this dropping makes that

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.790 
difference that this dropping makes that
edge<00:05:11.340> is<00:05:11.670> still<00:05:12.120> there<00:05:12.480> that<00:05:12.510> the<00:05:13.140> factory<00:05:13.560> put

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
edge is still there that the factory put

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.430 
edge is still there that the factory put
on<00:05:13.980> it<00:05:14.190> I<00:05:14.340> just<00:05:14.850> had<00:05:15.000> to<00:05:15.090> bring<00:05:15.330> it<00:05:15.480> back<00:05:15.720> with<00:05:16.410> a

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
on it I just had to bring it back with a

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.140 
on it I just had to bring it back with a
little<00:05:16.860> bit<00:05:16.979> of<00:05:17.010> polishing<00:05:17.610> on<00:05:17.760> that<00:05:17.940> leather

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
little bit of polishing on that leather

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:23.170 
little bit of polishing on that leather
watch<00:05:18.690> this

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.250 

look<00:05:24.180> at<00:05:24.300> that<00:05:24.480> oh<00:05:24.690> my<00:05:24.870> gosh

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
look at that oh my gosh

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:32.860 
look at that oh my gosh
what<00:05:28.260> a<00:05:28.940> neat<00:05:29.940> little<00:05:30.090> trick

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.210 

the<00:05:33.870> most<00:05:34.080> common<00:05:34.350> complete<00:05:34.680> you<00:05:34.800> see<00:05:34.980> about

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
the most common complete you see about

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.510 
the most common complete you see about
the<00:05:35.430> bk2<00:05:35.880> is<00:05:36.330> the<00:05:36.780> Sheep<00:05:37.080> I<00:05:37.350> think<00:05:38.160> earlier

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
the bk2 is the Sheep I think earlier

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.570 
the bk2 is the Sheep I think earlier
versions<00:05:38.970> had<00:05:39.240> retention<00:05:39.810> problems<00:05:40.230> but<00:05:41.040> they

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
versions had retention problems but they

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.000 
versions had retention problems but they
certainly<00:05:41.850> have<00:05:42.060> it<00:05:42.360> fixed<00:05:42.600> now<00:05:42.900> there's<00:05:43.740> no

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
certainly have it fixed now there's no

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.690 
certainly have it fixed now there's no
way<00:05:44.240> this<00:05:45.240> knife<00:05:45.510> is<00:05:45.750> coming<00:05:46.110> out<00:05:46.640> unless<00:05:47.640> you

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700 
way this knife is coming out unless you

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.470 
way this knife is coming out unless you
actually<00:05:48.240> put<00:05:48.510> thumb<00:05:48.840> pressure<00:05:49.140> to<00:05:50.130> help

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:50.480 
actually put thumb pressure to help

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.620 
actually put thumb pressure to help
split<00:05:51.480> the<00:05:51.630> two<00:05:51.810> halves<00:05:52.050> of<00:05:52.290> the<00:05:52.350> sheath<00:05:52.620> apart

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
split the two halves of the sheath apart

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.150 
split the two halves of the sheath apart
I'm<00:05:54.630> not<00:05:54.900> sure<00:05:55.110> whether<00:05:55.320> they<00:05:55.560> fixed<00:05:55.920> it<00:05:56.010> or

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 
I'm not sure whether they fixed it or

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.840 
I'm not sure whether they fixed it or
not<00:05:56.310> I<00:05:56.340> haven't<00:05:56.820> used<00:05:57.420> it<00:05:57.570> enough<00:05:57.810> to<00:05:57.990> know<00:05:58.850> but

00:05:59.840 --> 00:05:59.850 
not I haven't used it enough to know but

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.730 
not I haven't used it enough to know but
other<00:06:00.120> people<00:06:00.510> have<00:06:00.600> found<00:06:00.870> that<00:06:01.200> the<00:06:01.470> sheath

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
other people have found that the sheath

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.940 
other people have found that the sheath
dulls<00:06:02.340> the<00:06:02.640> knife<00:06:02.930> because<00:06:03.930> as<00:06:04.170> they<00:06:04.530> pull<00:06:04.800> it

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:04.950 
dulls the knife because as they pull it

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.190 
dulls the knife because as they pull it
out<00:06:05.100> it<00:06:05.340> hits<00:06:05.910> the<00:06:06.150> bottom<00:06:06.510> of<00:06:06.630> the<00:06:06.720> sheath<00:06:06.990> and

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:07.200 
out it hits the bottom of the sheath and

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.500 
out it hits the bottom of the sheath and
being<00:06:07.920> glass<00:06:08.190> filled<00:06:08.520> nylon<00:06:08.580> it<00:06:09.120> actually

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:09.510 
being glass filled nylon it actually

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.350 
being glass filled nylon it actually
works<00:06:09.780> kind<00:06:10.410> of<00:06:10.470> like<00:06:10.530> a<00:06:10.710> stone<00:06:11.240> taking<00:06:12.240> the

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
works kind of like a stone taking the

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.990 
works kind of like a stone taking the
edge<00:06:12.510> off<00:06:12.720> of<00:06:13.440> course<00:06:13.680> the<00:06:13.890> way<00:06:14.040> that<00:06:14.340> you<00:06:14.520> you

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
edge off of course the way that you you

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.630 
edge off of course the way that you you
deal<00:06:15.210> with<00:06:15.240> that<00:06:15.510> is<00:06:15.870> as<00:06:16.110> you<00:06:16.380> draw<00:06:16.680> you<00:06:17.460> just

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:17.640 
deal with that is as you draw you just

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.910 
deal with that is as you draw you just
put<00:06:17.820> a<00:06:17.850> little<00:06:18.000> upward<00:06:18.510> pressure<00:06:18.750> so<00:06:19.500> that<00:06:19.530> you

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:19.920 
put a little upward pressure so that you

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.220 
put a little upward pressure so that you
keep<00:06:20.160> that<00:06:20.340> blade<00:06:20.670> off<00:06:21.000> of<00:06:21.660> the<00:06:21.750> bottom<00:06:22.050> of<00:06:22.140> the

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:22.230 
keep that blade off of the bottom of the

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:23.960 
keep that blade off of the bottom of the
scabbard<00:06:22.530> you<00:06:23.160> don't<00:06:23.340> have<00:06:23.490> to<00:06:23.640> worry<00:06:23.820> about

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:23.970 
scabbard you don't have to worry about

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.170 
scabbard you don't have to worry about
that<00:06:24.500> but<00:06:25.500> you<00:06:25.680> can<00:06:25.920> buy<00:06:26.130> aftermarket<00:06:26.640> shoes

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:27.180 
that but you can buy aftermarket shoes

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.210 
that but you can buy aftermarket shoes
you<00:06:27.360> can<00:06:27.540> make<00:06:27.810> your<00:06:28.020> own<00:06:28.050> for<00:06:28.560> it<00:06:28.710> and<00:06:28.830> then

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:29.220 
you can make your own for it and then

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.310 
you can make your own for it and then
you<00:06:29.340> don't<00:06:29.520> have<00:06:29.670> to<00:06:29.790> worry<00:06:30.000> about<00:06:30.090> that<00:06:30.510> but

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:31.320 
you don't have to worry about that but

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.080 
you don't have to worry about that but

I<00:06:56.160> might<00:06:57.090> be<00:06:57.330> doing<00:06:57.660> some<00:06:57.810> texturing<00:06:58.470> on<00:06:58.620> the

00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:58.830 
I might be doing some texturing on the

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.650 
I might be doing some texturing on the
handle<00:06:59.190> because<00:06:59.310> I<00:06:59.490> find<00:06:59.940> the<00:07:00.120> graver<00:07:00.450> II

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:00.660

pretty<00:07:01.320> slippery<00:07:01.650> once<00:07:02.040> my<00:07:02.220> hands<00:07:02.550> get<00:07:02.760> sweaty
