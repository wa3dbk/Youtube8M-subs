00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:07.919
 for our dessert are a cup of 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.769
 milk we are going to need three tablespoons 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:14.250
 of cornstarch we are also going to need a 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.520
 can of condensed milk a can or 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.890
 these milk cream boxes and let's go 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.410
 the need oral cookies 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.779
 biscuits here in the USA where I 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.310
 I can not get them alive so it's going to 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.609
 use the recipes that I am using 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.009
 showing but it is to devise the vowels 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.420
 we are also going to need of course 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.420
 the milo 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.190
 the utensils that we are going to need is 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:46.610
 a plastic spatula we're also going to 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:50.000
 need a spoon to make our 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:53.060
 milk mixture a refractory where 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.070
 put our dessert and a pot 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.410
 anyone 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.090
 well we started making the dessert what 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.760
 first thing we're going to do is in a pot 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.860
 put the milk cream we will put the 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.550
 condensed milk and let's leave these 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:10.280
 two ingredients over medium heat after 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:13.910
 apart let's get the milk the cup 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.070
 milk and the three tablespoons of cornstarch and 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.650
 let's put them together and let's 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.620
 stir it until there is no 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.780
 group 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.980
 It is very important that there is no lumps 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.980
 in this process 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.259
 well let's put the milk now in the 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.210
 pot the mixture we had 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:01.450
 before and we're going to put it on fire 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.570
 under as low as they can and we're going to 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:08.610
 stir and stir and stir until 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:12.270
 stay like a cream consistency 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.710
 or this creamy milk like that and there already 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.480
 we can put out the fire is very 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.480
 important to be always stirring 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.920
 well this is what they are going to do is a 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.510
 layer of cookies and it does not matter if you use 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.549
 a reflector already square one 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.739
 refractory circular the reflector since 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:31.599
 have this is the one I'm using 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.219
 it's a bit difficult to put the cookies in 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.890
 this refractory so I had to cut 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:37.750
 some so that they are not almost hollow anymore 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.159
 that are not local cookies and the 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.620
 biscuits are usually 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:43.959
 square but good now after 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.810
 put these cookies I'm going to put my 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.000
 cream or this milk that we made 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.060
 before and it does not matter if the cream 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.530
 it is hot it is better that the cream is 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.040
 hot just now we're going to put it 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.769
 in the fridge and with a spatula of 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.689
 plastic what we are going to do is 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:04.659
 distribute all our milk mixture 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:08.099
 for our refractory so that 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:08.099
 cover all the cookies 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.890
 keep in mind that we are going to put another 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.830
 layer of this milk or this cream then 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.209
 keep in the middle of this milk now what 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.340
 what we are going to do is put the milo 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:30.120
 over sun bordering it all over our 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.120
 dessert 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.800
 rich 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.730
 good and let's put another layer of 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.290
 cookies and these cookies I ran out 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.079
 so I started using the other 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.490
 cookies that they had had them 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.580
 shown at the beginning the video in my 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:29.130
 ingredients and the two cookies sometimes I 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.370
 they love are like sweets and you are and 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.140
 they serve and are very very rich in these 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.870
 last the square ones are integral in 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.820
 three are healthier 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.920
 and the dessert was really delicious 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.450
 after this to put them the layer of 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.360
 cookies we're going to put again the 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:48.060
 layer of milk creamer we made 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.270
 I militate and these we are going to take to the 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.550
 refrigerator for about 8 hours and 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:57.380
 then we can cut it there and 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.380
 enjoy our dessert 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.520
