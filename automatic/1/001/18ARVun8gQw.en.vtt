00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
of distance on a map so that does mean

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.470

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
zealot out right off the bat going to be

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.190 
zealot out right off the bat going to be
able<00:03:14.060> to<00:03:14.210> defend<00:03:14.330> things<00:03:14.720> a<00:03:14.780> little<00:03:14.900> bit<00:03:15.050> more

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200

the worker he doesn't manage to get the

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:39.749 
the worker he doesn't manage to get the
worker<00:04:38.560> down<00:04:38.860> so<00:04:39.099> that<00:04:39.129> means<00:04:39.370> he<00:04:39.490> will<00:04:39.610> be

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:39.759 
worker down so that means he will be

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:41.550 
worker down so that means he will be
safe<00:04:40.000> for<00:04:40.240> now<00:04:40.419> and<00:04:40.629> socket<00:04:41.139> could<00:04:41.319> have<00:04:41.409> had

so many more units at the front gate and

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:45.409 
so many more units at the front gate and
he<00:04:43.690> needs<00:04:43.870> to<00:04:43.900> throw<00:04:44.080> out<00:04:44.139> another<00:04:44.169> Wharf<00:04:44.680> in

he needs to throw out another Wharf in

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.219
