of what we didn't see with the base of

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.340

with<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.490> electoral<00:01:53.880> strategy<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.979> uh<00:01:55.979> then

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
with the electoral strategy and uh then

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.490 
with the electoral strategy and uh then
hope<00:01:56.729> that's<00:01:56.969> gonna<00:01:57.149> bring<00:01:57.390> about<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:58.020> broader

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500

hope that's gonna bring about a broader
movement<00:01:58.740> on<00:01:59.040> some<00:01:59.250> level<00:01:59.579> we<00:01:59.610> need<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.939> do

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
movement on some level we need to do

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.179 
movement on some level we need to do
this<00:02:00.270> are<00:02:00.570> we<00:02:01.229> need<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.469> sort<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:01.740> do<00:02:01.860> both

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
this are we need to sort of do both

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.050 
this are we need to sort of do both
simultaneously<00:02:03.110> uh<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.909> expect<00:02:05.909> the

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
simultaneously uh and expect the

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.080 
simultaneously uh and expect the
efficacy<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.659> an<00:02:07.110> electoral<00:02:07.590> strategy<00:02:07.910> to<00:02:08.910> be

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
efficacy of an electoral strategy to be

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.059 
efficacy of an electoral strategy to be
