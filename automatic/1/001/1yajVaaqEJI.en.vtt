a<00:02:51.280> 2<00:02:51.579> clutch<00:02:51.909> system<00:02:52.450> let<00:02:52.959> me<00:02:53.049> tell<00:02:53.230> you<00:02:53.349> how<00:02:53.500> it

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
a 2 clutch system let me tell you how it

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:54.030 
a 2 clutch system let me tell you how it
works

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
works

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.399 
works
let's<00:02:54.579> say<00:02:54.790> for<00:02:54.849> example<00:02:55.060> you're<00:02:55.690> in<00:02:55.720> 2nd<00:02:56.290> gear

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:56.409 
let's say for example you're in 2nd gear

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:58.800 
let's say for example you're in 2nd gear
the<00:02:56.859> other<00:02:57.040> clutch<00:02:57.400> actually<00:02:57.849> pre<00:02:58.090> slicks<00:02:58.390> 3rd

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
the other clutch actually pre slicks 3rd

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:59.250 
the other clutch actually pre slicks 3rd
gear

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
gear

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.199 
gear
so<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.650> shifts<00:03:00.010> between<00:03:00.159> gears<00:03:00.579> it's<00:03:00.940> that

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
so the shifts between gears it's that

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:02.940 
so the shifts between gears it's that
quick<00:03:01.510> it's<00:03:01.750> that<00:03:01.930> instant<00:03:02.230> there's

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
quick it's that instant there's

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.009 
quick it's that instant there's
absolutely<00:03:03.340> no<00:03:03.579> friction<00:03:04.150> loss<00:03:04.359> between<00:03:04.659> gear

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
absolutely no friction loss between gear

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:06.690 
absolutely no friction loss between gear
shifts<00:03:05.409> but<00:03:05.829> not<00:03:06.040> only<00:03:06.099> that<00:03:06.220> we<00:03:06.489> get<00:03:06.609> the

Sport Plus mode and what this does it

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.319 
Sport Plus mode and what this does it
actually<00:03:08.859> sharpens<00:03:09.489> up<00:03:09.639> the<00:03:09.760> gear<00:03:09.970> shifts

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
actually sharpens up the gear shifts

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:12.360 
actually sharpens up the gear shifts
