00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
course results in some kind of imbalance

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.400 
course results in some kind of imbalance
positions<00:00:50.460> because<00:00:50.700> this<00:00:51.480> group<00:00:51.960> will<00:00:52.140> go<00:00:52.350> to

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
positions because this group will go to

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.850 
positions because this group will go to
GA<00:00:52.680> then<00:00:52.949> like<00:00:53.879> will<00:00:54.149> continue<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.829> f5<00:00:55.829> and

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
GA then like will continue it f5 and

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.830 
GA then like will continue it f5 and
also<00:00:56.399> this<00:00:56.670> Bishop<00:00:56.969> will<00:00:57.090> be<00:00:57.210> developed<00:00:57.600> from

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
also this Bishop will be developed from

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.410 
also this Bishop will be developed from
from<00:00:58.140> this<00:00:58.320> diagonal<00:00:59.309> so<00:00:59.820> black<00:01:00.210> at<00:01:00.359> the
