00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:20.570
 Hello and welcome to the first to 4 3 b but the three baths podcast 

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:22.510
 my name is saw 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.410
 Meyer and I want to tell you something about 3d in Diablo 3 11 11 today 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.239
 and I here with my studio 12 o'clock were by the enemy one 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:32.960
 schnitzel 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.500
 yes first try to get risen RC rental returns 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.930
 there are currently 2 million 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.790
 Iran is trying the so-called in vain 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.470
 The first method will certainly be free kick for the 4th 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.280
 There they get special glasses at the entrance 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.480
 and cedars challenging the movie in 3d on the canvas 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.720
 the second case deepens 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.580
 on procedural issues 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.820
 are then the so-called shutter glasses 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.090
 and around here, since I think two of the three years, there's been a more productive one 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.090
 the 84th 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.590
 understand this 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.610
 RR special Mrs. Roth changed 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.610
 this transmitter to the emergency just to 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:24.680
 the multitude 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.930
 fresh fish 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.930
 which in turns alternately the left and right deep sleep 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.470
 at the same time shows the graph had slightly offset the team twice 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.120
 on top of each other 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.120
 then just here, the so-called 3d effect arises 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.600
 yes and around for a few days there are then 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.600
 now also a new video card driver package from 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.690
 There he falls to a Diablo 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.160
 we will contact each other 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.800
 Of course, do not miss the whole thing and try it out directly 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.979
 and at this point I have to say Josef first have to 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.240
 only five children 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.240
 without gates got the car show 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.230
 with the 3d-effects currently just to a whole new level 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.660
 the songbook that is lived 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.070
 on the frame feelings past the left ear and we want to have 

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:25.869
 the delivery of 500 000 other ob open 

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:27.229
 sometimes enough 

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:30.499
 put your finger around the corner 

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:34.399
 At the same time, however, it must be that it is looking at it next to the 3d 

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:37.109
 even one or the other representation error goes 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:38.859
 around in the 3d area 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:42.339
 and he personally is one of the most of the shadow of his own 

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:44.219
 Character noticed 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:45.909
 will be shown in the future 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:47.979
 I think that Blizzard is here 

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:50.979
 certainly still in one place or another 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.159
 so that was the hall 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:56.379
 but also in Diablo 3 at least 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:59.879
 For example, StarCraft 2 or World of 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.799
 Warcraft is free 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.689
 yes I think it was already 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:09.509
 because I wanted to learn more posts of the 3d vision meticulous then I recommend 

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:12.099
 you themes like the back 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.529
 there is 

00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:18.540
 and perhaps finally followed by reference to Vienna in the 

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:19.109
 next 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.179
 He does not do electronics 

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:25.179
 next to the 3w power on 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.179
 Place percent represents 

00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:32.179
 on the Steiner that actually 60 Hertz so must pay attention 

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:37.489
 and in addition it is of course still advisable relatively new percent 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.289
 Computer system 

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:43.879
 First, the computational load is more or less doubled due to 3d 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:48.270
 on the 12th when I was just drunk 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.439
 I do not understand it live so the problem 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:52.729
 but 

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:55.439
 because you get physical then 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:57.359
 and should also be elsewhere 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:58.659
 Reason is the 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:01.659
 a very many games supporting the 3d 

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:06.059
 during this job 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:09.899
 not in the next 

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:13.119
 Of course, we will continue to provide you with daylight for Lichtenbusch days 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.820
 and how do I think if I ever want to play a 3d human
