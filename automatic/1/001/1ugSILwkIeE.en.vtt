00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hence you get a trilogy only planet 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.470
 to discover that the first two 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.440
 books are basically stories that will get you 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.480
 introduce the characters and the world and 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.429
 true story will only roll in today 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.890
 third book 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.520
 Welcome to the world of the witch girl thierry 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.520
 henry 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.250
 as the name of the saga itself tells the 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.860
 books will follow the adventures 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:40.649
 giant of a witch and a wizard 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.540
 in this fantasy world of andrÃ© already 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.390
 chaos that I be there as it is pronounced 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.610
 This is someone trained since childhood. 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.390
 to fight monsters and creatures 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.730
 fantastic and what is not missing even in 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.860
 all books are various types of 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.120
 fantastic creatures possible and 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.309
 imaginary 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.590
 I assure you that you will not go 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.949
 find both monsters and creatures 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.390
 together or if you add harry potter is 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.400
 the lord of the rings and the chronicles of 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.530
 narnia together 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.380
 this one the guy got the 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.560
 mythological creatures 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.049
 not Roman in any Egyptian and did 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.430
 a great cauldron and put everything together 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.650
 three books 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.970
 not to mention the various races that have already 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:31.520
 are common to high- tech fantasy 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.479
 mediaeval are the elves the elves 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.040
 Muslims and so on 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.930
 and when I told you that the two 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.210
 first books the other law 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.670
 the first two books the last wish 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.320
 and the sword of fate knows about 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.659
 introduce the characters not to be 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.240
 This is really exaggerated because 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.430
 these two are basically a compiled 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.409
 from tales of gui to death adventures 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.420
 from and 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.060
 you just recognized who you are 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.289
 all the characters they make and 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.119
 there goes 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:01.530
 and also to explain what are 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.649
 the powers of war or their 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.719
 limitations them to 30 and this form is 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.489
 it showed quite tiring so 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.019
 tiring when the first is the first 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.360
 book after realizing that there were several 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:14.099
 several stories and I was afraid to pick up 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.349
 the second book because I thought it might say 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.510
 carol is following the same path and did not give 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:21.540
 another was just this is just in the 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.060
 third book the blood of the elves 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.190
 really creates a complete story with 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.510
 greater sense of chronology 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.370
 development and also at this time that 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.530
 I will get all the 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.540
 characters all with the help of all 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.489
 the characters that appear in the stories 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.040
 two first books and puts it all 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.650
 in the same story and tabasco mexico to 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.720
 lets confuse the crowd and in reality 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.599
 I 'm wrong, I'll go wrong because it's not a 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.340
 technology not only these three books 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.349
 when I arrived at the end of your book that 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.660
 I thought it was the last one did not have 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:54.569
 end the story of the blood of the targets and 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.910
 I called lie has given further 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:00.329
 and it is not because it is absurd to 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:03.870
 good people of the honey type have already lost time nor 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:06.000
 2 33 books to learn how this 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.000
 story ends and swears it does not end 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.639
 in this book was so frustrating and so 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.819
 this series has five more books five 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:18.150
 books after that the excuse of the 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:20.190
 blood of the elves is eight books 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.319
 up to now, not to mention that 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.810
 This is indeed comic stories. 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:27.359
 adaptation of the television series to 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.180
 older son jett to video game or 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:33.239
 it is only the whole reason for success there 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.959
 out and actions continue in various 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.019
 media 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:39.840
 It's a lot of things, but let's go. 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:42.720
 the characters did not bring me almost 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.180
 no emotion this was a problem one 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.639
 of the few characters who looked at points 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.019
 It's fuck if you call and nf and she'll just go. 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:51.329
 appear at the end of the first 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:53.459
 first book that is this here and is a 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:55.240
 super powerful brand and I love you 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.250
 You know that the woman's daughter- in- law 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:01.800
 numerous who kick ass 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:03.820
 many waves and the rest of the world is kind 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.560
 some characters are minimally 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.420
 interesting but none really 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.340
 It appealed to me. I liked it a lot. 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.600
 also that some of the short stories 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.630
 especially the first two books 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.280
 they also depart a lot of fairy tales 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.560
 those who already know the 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.500
 Little Red Riding Hood at 10 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.180
 only that nothing is done with reference 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.580
 they will never speak to 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.640
 little red cape to rapunzel always 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.590
 the reader is identified is seeing 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.510
 the author's inspirations 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.250
 so you have to read quite a lot 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.050
 care and this happens not only 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.150
 main story also happens 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.890
 some references that they make of 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.860
 old stories are parallel things 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.870
 not exactly heating history 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.180
 but not that curiosity happens 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.730
 I know what you're talking about. 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:52.750
 themes outside the struggle of good versus evil 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:54.670
 which is a slightly gray thing in that 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.710
 these books were also a 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:59.800
 issue of prejudice because several 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.750
 moments to the characters are in 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.660
 which is basically that phrase 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.160
 do not judge a book by its cover then it 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.200
 you find situations where what is 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.460
 being shown on the outside is not 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.370
 exactly what is happening for 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.140
 inside and also diverse situations where 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.230
 they themselves are victims of prejudice 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.760
 Who are they from, where do they belong? 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.710
 sexy over there 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.350
 so give up a calendar if in the heart 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:26.800
 think that there may be people who are going to come 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:29.770
 there book them and take it the notion of 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.110
 that differences must be respected 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.390
 the three books are narrated in third 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.910
 person mainly following the steps 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:39.340
 of the club are not born in the first two 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.840
 The third book gives him more space. 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.820
 so that some minor characters 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.800
 become protagonists mainly 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.980
 a specific character who will only 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.170
 appear in the third book even the author 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.790
 he tells the facts of events already 

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:52.830
 said 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:55.410
 very fast dynamic it does not lose 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.750
 long with formal descriptions that are 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.460
 important the inscriptions they appear 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.470
 in some moments they do not last 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.340
 pages and pages in a way that leaves a 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.830
 reader 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.660
 bored to the biggest problem indeed 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.800
 with all three books were the 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.200
 dialogues 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.880
 I think it was very tactful by the author 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.070
 to create dialogues that were 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.230
 the situations in which the 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.910
 characters met were some of the 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:21.690
 games which sometimes will turn the eyes 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:24.000
 I thought mail jura awa in dealing with 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:26.850
 third person is very important that 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.860
 the games are written well in order to 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:30.170
 express exactly the characters 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.730
 are you feeling and your opinions 

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:34.980
 opinions of the situations in which they 

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:36.120
 They find it so when when 

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.890
 well done 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.570
 You saw that asking for some confidence. 

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:41.190
 in what the character says 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.990
 and this happened a lot to me during 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:45.720
 his three books so went well 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.860
 disappointing is absurdly 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.060
 sincere 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.250
 after you finish this technology 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.330
 I stayed almost two weeks without getting a 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.670
 book 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:56.160
 so this is the hangover 

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:57.930
 because I already had it so 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.630
 you need time to chew the 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:02.820
 information get rid of the disappointment that 

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:06.360
 was to discover that the third book in the 

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:08.340
 end of the story and also has the notion 

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.080
 that the lock knows hours and hours and 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:13.290
 hours of my life in a reading that 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.400
 I did not like it that much, but living and 

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:16.920
 learning 

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:20.790
 the three books of the wizard saga harry 

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:21.930
 terrible I'll take two trios and that was 

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.820
 the message today 

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:26.340
 So if you liked this video click 

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:27.320
 I liked showing the channel sign up 

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.940
 also know our website 

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:32.430
 capitanbado.com br br and accompanies 

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:35.150
 people on twitter and facebook and this is it 

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:35.150
 until the next
