it's one I'm most associated I think

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:01.120 
it's one I'm most associated I think
it's<00:02:00.170> one<00:02:00.259> of<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:00.409> best<00:02:00.590> organs<00:02:00.920> in<00:02:01.039> the

it's one of the best organs in the
country<00:02:02.380> and<00:02:03.380> it<00:02:03.499> feels<00:02:03.679> very<00:02:03.740> much<00:02:03.889> part<00:02:04.249> of

00:02:04.269 --> 00:02:04.279 
country and it feels very much part of

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:05.830 
country and it feels very much part of
my<00:02:04.369> life<00:02:04.459> because<00:02:04.880> I<00:02:04.999> played<00:02:05.270> it<00:02:05.420> I<00:02:05.479> think<00:02:05.689> more

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
my life because I played it I think more

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.779 
my life because I played it I think more
than<00:02:05.869> anyone<00:02:06.259> else<00:02:06.350> has<00:02:06.590> played<00:02:06.829> it<00:02:07.039> and<00:02:07.609> its

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
than anyone else has played it and its

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:09.010 
than anyone else has played it and its
whole<00:02:07.939> entirety<00:02:08.300> and<00:02:08.660> when<00:02:08.780> it's<00:02:08.929> at

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
whole entirety and when it's at

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.120 
whole entirety and when it's at
positions<00:02:09.350> in<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:09.500> cinema

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
positions in the cinema

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.620 
positions in the cinema

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
interested but I would hope that it

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.660 
interested but I would hope that it
could<00:02:41.960> keep<00:02:42.140> going<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:42.710> there's<00:02:43.250> no<00:02:43.340> reason

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
could keep going and there's no reason

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.830 
could keep going and there's no reason
why<00:02:43.790> it<00:02:43.850> shouldn't<00:02:44.060> keep<00:02:44.240> going<00:02:44.540> because<00:02:44.690> I

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
why it shouldn't keep going because I

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.180 
why it shouldn't keep going because I
think<00:02:44.900> it's<00:02:45.140> an<00:02:45.200> art<00:02:45.350> form<00:02:45.590> this<00:02:45.800> works<00:02:45.980> for

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
think it's an art form this works for

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.610 
think it's an art form this works for
many<00:02:46.340> many<00:02:46.550> years<00:02:46.850> and<00:02:47.060> I<00:02:47.960> don't<00:02:48.110> see<00:02:48.380> why<00:02:48.560> it

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
many many years and I don't see why it

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.860 
many many years and I don't see why it
couldn't<00:02:48.890> continue<00:02:49.310> and<00:02:49.670> I'd<00:02:50.450> hope<00:02:50.630> to<00:02:50.690> think

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
couldn't continue and I'd hope to think

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.930 
couldn't continue and I'd hope to think
it<00:02:51.020> does<00:02:51.140> keep<00:02:51.320> going<00:02:51.590> but<00:02:51.830> as<00:02:51.920> I<00:02:52.010> say<00:02:52.190> I'm<00:02:52.400> in

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
it does keep going but as I say I'm in

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.210 
it does keep going but as I say I'm in
my<00:02:53.120> 50s<00:02:53.480> now<00:02:53.540> so<00:02:53.930> I'm<00:02:54.080> probably<00:02:54.620> not<00:02:54.800> creepy

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
my 50s now so I'm probably not creepy

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.810 
them type of things really so I don't
think<00:03:33.380> I<00:03:33.410> could<00:03:33.590> specify<00:03:33.800> particular<00:03:34.310> tune

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
think I could specify particular tune

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.050 
think I could specify particular tune
because<00:03:35.060> I<00:03:35.150> just<00:03:35.330> love<00:03:35.450> it<00:03:35.570> all<00:03:36.040> um<00:03:37.040> and<00:03:37.400> what

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
because I just love it all um and what

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.180 
because I just love it all um and what
was<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.420> who<00:03:38.959> was<00:03:39.050> the<00:03:39.170> organist<00:03:39.500> most<00:03:39.950> looked

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
was the who was the organist most looked

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.880 
was the who was the organist most looked
up<00:03:40.310> to<00:03:40.520> when<00:03:40.820> you<00:03:40.970> were<00:03:41.090> in<00:03:41.270> your<00:03:41.800> younger<00:03:42.800> days

up to when you were in your younger days

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.699 
up to when you were in your younger days
um<00:03:43.580> I<00:03:44.060> think<00:03:44.180> it<00:03:44.480> was<00:03:44.510> early<00:03:45.110> recordings<00:03:45.620> I
