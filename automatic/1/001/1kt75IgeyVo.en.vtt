00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
of Facebook home I actually had a poll

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.400 
of Facebook home I actually had a poll
on<00:03:06.640> my<00:03:06.910> website<00:03:07.330> asking<00:03:07.660> if<00:03:07.780> you<00:03:07.900> were<00:03:08.140> using

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
on my website asking if you were using

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.470 
on my website asking if you were using
it<00:03:08.709> and<00:03:08.830> about<00:03:08.980> over<00:03:09.550> eighty<00:03:09.760> percent<00:03:10.030> of<00:03:10.330> you

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
it and about over eighty percent of you

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.229 
it and about over eighty percent of you
said<00:03:10.750> that<00:03:10.870> you<00:03:10.959> didn't<00:03:11.200> even<00:03:11.260> use<00:03:11.560> it<00:03:11.739> so<00:03:12.239> it

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
said that you didn't even use it so it

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.509 
said that you didn't even use it so it
seems<00:03:13.540> to<00:03:13.600> be<00:03:13.690> a<00:03:13.780> bit<00:03:13.840> of<00:03:14.350> a<00:03:14.470> fail<00:03:14.800> on<00:03:15.070> Facebook

a ton of money into it I think it's over
20<00:04:53.860> billion<00:04:54.160> dollars<00:04:54.880> so<00:04:55.300> Sprint's<00:04:56.260> actually

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
20 billion dollars so Sprint's actually

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.040 
20 billion dollars so Sprint's actually

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120
