passcode
this<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.549> what<00:01:08.729> my<00:01:08.850> lock<00:01:09.119> screen<00:01:09.150> looks<00:01:09.720> like

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
this is what my lock screen looks like

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.859 
this is what my lock screen looks like
and<00:01:10.320> yes<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.250> looks<00:01:11.640> really<00:01:12.270> weird<00:01:12.479> different

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
and yes it looks really weird different

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.929 
and yes it looks really weird different
than<00:01:13.320> usual<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.310> because<00:01:14.670> it's

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
than usual and this is because it's

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.609 
than usual and this is because it's
jailbroke<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.810> that's<00:01:15.930> what<00:01:16.080> makes<00:01:16.259> my<00:01:16.439> apps

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
jailbroke and that's what makes my apps

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.100 
jailbroke and that's what makes my apps
like<00:01:16.890> this<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.759> it's<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.600> really<00:01:18.780> like

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
like this and it's a really like

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.200 
like this and it's a really like
complicated<00:01:19.560> process<00:01:20.100> but<00:01:20.400> basically<00:01:20.610> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
complicated process but basically the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.179 
complicated process but basically the
the<00:01:21.509> reason<00:01:21.780> why<00:01:21.930> they're<00:01:22.350> like<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:22.920> cut

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
the reason why they're like this is cut

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.820 
the reason why they're like this is cut
my<00:01:23.400> phone<00:01:23.520> is<00:01:23.700> jailbroken<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.720> that's<00:01:25.590> why

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
my phone is jailbroken so that's why

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.260 
my phone is jailbroken so that's why
they're<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.340> apps<00:01:26.460> are<00:01:26.670> like<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.240> I

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
they're the apps are like that and I

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.760 
they're the apps are like that and I
know<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.600> looks<00:01:27.750> pretty<00:01:27.960> cool<00:01:28.110> isn't<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.470> so

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
know it looks pretty cool isn't it so

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.499 
know it looks pretty cool isn't it so
just<00:01:29.130> starting<00:01:29.520> on<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.700> top<00:01:29.880> here<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.210> have
