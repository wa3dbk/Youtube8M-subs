00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:13.910
 Hello Bin Diesel is the View Blackbird d Call of Duty Black Obsession's appendix 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.200
 I want to take a moment to introduce the Call of Duty series to the video briefly. 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.040
 I will 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:22.760
 Call of Duty 4 The first work was released in 2003, 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:25.369
 It was the first time I got into fps. 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.430
 To truly love the game and a lot injira 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:32.960
 So it is a game that is more sad nowadays . 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:34.580
 In 2003, Infiniti Ward launched the Quake 3 sub engine 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.079
 I made it better 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:44.480
 At this time, the publisher was Activision, because it was based on World War II. 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:48.530
 I was competing with the Medal of Honor, which had already been a big success. 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.360
 The ash group Infiniti Ward itself has some of the producers who sell themselves 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.590
 I do not even have a company I created . 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.090
 Please, Call of Duty One has a high degree of completeness . 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.860
 Climb 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:05.750
 Then, in 2004, we release the expansion pack, Yoona's dd offense. 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:10.100
 For u5, I was in charge of development at a company called Graymeter Interactive. 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:13.670
 The company will be merged in the future and will Treyarch is one convenience 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:17.690
 You can say that the fun is more grooved chicken work 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.250
 Overall, it looks similar, but you can get more content 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:24.259
 She showed her talent. 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:28.250
 In 2005 doetneyo to the Infinity Ward released the Call of Duty developed tools 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.509
 Considerable success also based on a ridiculously corny graphics compared to its predecessor, Beth 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:34.009
 Climb 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:37.140
 The automatic recovery from physical systems were introduced and authentic from the work 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:41.880
 Love Zhuki's show started. 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:45.000
 In 2006, Tray Arc released Call of Skill. 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.439
 I do not know how to do it. 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:54.079
 Tracy gets a proud title of big trash. 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.079
 It took me a while to get to the Tray Arc mini title. 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:02.960
 And finally, Infiniti Ward did his job. 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:07.580
 The 2007 Call of Duty Foro Bears Fair will be released in 2007. 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:11.890
 For the first time in the series, if you abandoned World War II menopause and adopted Hyundai I 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:17.420
 More great Jean Photography and excellent soft output based on a great story 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:21.560
 Call of Duty series is the highest rating ever, of course, all the world's fps 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.790
 Even if you think that you got the best evaluation in the game, 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.410
 Enjoyed popularity jjyon 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.940
 If I write, I personally like to learn the background of the Second World War . 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.170
 I have not listened. 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:37.550
 So when I see you get so crazy about it, 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:41.660
 And in 2008 , the background in the Tray Arc again 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:44.840
 Released in World War II and Call of Duty World. 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:50.750
 At this time, they became the first nose stopped beorini over the d series 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:54.320
 Call of Duty: Yoon Knowlge Offense Probe d24 Love d3 All in all 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:57.740
 Of the current World War II fps games 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:01.550
 I would personally like to say that it was the best game 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:05.570
 It's funny. I did not miss a day. 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:07.100
 The reason why only disadvantage of Treyarch and gals I still Nya War II is 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:11.180
 Two reasons mixed 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:14.720
 The evaluation was very good compared to the quality of the game 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.030
 And from this time on, Infiniti Ward and Tracy Arkagh will call- in every two years . 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.870
 It was released. 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:23.230
 Infiniti Ward is a series of Modern Warfare Silver Black Ops series weak 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.230
 I mean. 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:34.040
 In 2009, Infiniti Ward releases the Call of Duty Modern Warfare tool. 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.959
 The graphics are a bit better than the previous one, 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.750
 Having a story together 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:42.200
 If you tell me, I'm like a whimper. 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:46.010
 Thanks to the success of his previous work, he is also very successful . 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:50.150
 Actually, I think I used to have fun on the moon when I was modern. 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.620
 I did not even think it was scary either. And in 2010, 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:56.060
 He does this 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:04:00.830
 It just released the Black Ops. It has an unfamiliar material called the Cold War era. 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:04.819
 And the last word story directed by reversing stand gyeotdeulyimyeon Treyarch like Movies 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:08.420
 I will release another title of garbage in the next few years. 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:10.220
 Personally, after the Second World War, 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.540
 It's also a work. 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:18.709
 In 2010, however , Infiniti Ward will face a crisis. 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.540
 Due to the conflict of Activision, Infinity Ward is the main attraction of the majority 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:25.160
 It's gone. 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:29.150
 They went on to understand now and set up a company called Responsive Entertainment 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:32.990
 Anyway, Infinity Ward has lost its power with the help of kkuyeok Wooyoung everywhere, Ltd. 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:37.010
 We receive and sell modern warfare 3 ri pile 100 years 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:40.340
 12 I have seen the worst evaluation of priests 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:45.530
 The user evaluation hovered around 3 points by 10 points 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:49.700
 Graphics are as good of a story to go into the mountains is also directed eopji malyijyo increase the number 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:53.389
 Even when the world in a couple of funny indeed something to write Treyarch released a few second 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:56.780
 Those who paid 2 and treated Infiniti Ward 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:05:00.020
 Suddenly through the Modern Warfare 3, Tray Arc worship station 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:04.669
 Infinity Warding has begun. 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:09.169
 As seen fans watched in 10 years I can not be the true one funny 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:11.060
 Well, I have released Black Ops Tool in 2012, 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:15.830
 It is not good. 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:17.780
 The Black ObsTu game itself may be fine, but the reputation of the series itself 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:21.889
 Looks like it fell a lot. 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:25.520
 This year's sequel to Modern Warfare will be released, but I'm worried about it already 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:29.300
 It's up ahead. People's mind seems to have already left . 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:31.729
 Oh, and for your reference, there are a lot more consoles 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:35.060
 I also made Call of Duty . 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:36.500
 It seemed that I could not play and I was deliberately 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:41.419
 I lost it. 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:42.169
 As a fan of Kurve 1, I hope you will be able to beat the horror again 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:46.840
 see 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:46.840
 Thank you for watching Blackvin remembers so far . 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:52.969
 U 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.639
 I will
