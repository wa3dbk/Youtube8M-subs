00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.109
 [Music] 

00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:07.860
 what is an acb its symptoms 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:11.020
 acb are the acronyms that define a 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:13.710
 stroke which can 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.970
 have their origin when the flow or 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.430
 blood supply that irrigates a 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:21.100
 part of the brain is interrupted from 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.869
 sudden way or when a glass 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.570
 blood breaks at this level 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.789
 organic thereby generating a 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.270
 blood spill in the spaces that 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:34.210
 surround the brain cells this is 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.489
 a case similar to a heart attack already 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.829
 it can occur when 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.489
 generates a lack of blood flow to 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.309
 heart 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.500
 for that reason in comparison also usually 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:47.620
 say that a person with lack of 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.840
 blood flow to the brain or who suffers 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.260
 a hemorrhage at this level has a 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.680
 stroke but it is more common 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:01:00.039
 stroke or acb term 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.829
 what we should know is that the cells 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:04.960
 brain cells are neurons die when 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.330
 they stop receiving oxygen 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.090
 and nutrients from the blood as well as 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:14.440
 They are also damaged when a 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:16.540
 bleeding into or around the brain 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.780
 term used to define a 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:23.200
 loss of oxygen and nutrients at the 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.570
 cellular is called ischemia and 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.690
 when this occurs it leads 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.270
 finally to a heart attack or cell death 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.570
 when the blood flow is interrupted 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:37.869
 to the brain some of its cells die 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:40.780
 almost immediately and others remain in 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:43.830
 risk or compromised to have the 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.869
 same end these damaged cells 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.509
 they constitute what is usually called 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.750
 ischemic penumbra since they can 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:55.690
 remain at risk for several hours 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:59.289
 Therefore, a timely treatment or 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:03.399
 time can save them the symptoms of 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:05.780
 an acb are easy to detect and enter 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:08.390
 they include the following 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.850
 Sudden numbness or weakness 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.280
 especially on one side of the body 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.680
 sudden confusion or problems with the 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.070
 speech or understanding problems 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.400
 sudden in sight with one or both 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.800
 eyes sudden problems in walking 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.950
 dizziness loss of balance and 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.550
 severe headache coordination 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.740
 sudden without known cause all these 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.740
 symptoms that anticipate an accident 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.500
 cerebrovascular diseases are usually spontaneous or 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:43.140
 appear suddenly may be more 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:47.070
 of one at the same time therefore it is 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:50.160
 easy to differentiate an acb from other causes 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:53.070
 dizziness or headaches 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:57.200
 therefore requiring medical attention 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:03:00.960
 Immediate there are two forms of ac 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.120
 ischemic and hemorrhagic the first one 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.480
 translates into a blockage of a glass 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.900
 blood and hemorrhagic acb in a 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.190
 blood stroke in the brain and 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.620
 around it 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.890
 friends I hope this information will 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:21.020
 has been useful and as always 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.020
 I wish the best for your lives
