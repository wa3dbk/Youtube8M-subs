00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:10.980
 is the recipe of the day and chopped off 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.849
 salmon also saffron rice for 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.860
 four people 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.440
 we need four salmon pavers one 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.750
 raw cider bottle 10 centilitres of 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.939
 thick cream 2 shallots one 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.619
 fresh basil handle a dose of 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.619
 saffron salt and pepper 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.779
 we start by preheating the 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.210
 oven at 200 Â° first step I'm going 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.079
 mince the shallots 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.010
 I insist on the whole length without 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.320
 go to the end then a sense of 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.770
 the thickness pays attention to the 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.800
 fingers and in Switzerland it does not stay anymore 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.110
 only to chopped up and we will now take care 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.910
 salmon we will remove the skin and the 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.980
 cut into cubes to remove there for I 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.430
 go down my knife between the skin 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.649
 and the flesh 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.300
 here and then what I do is 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.730
 that my knife game lorient you do 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.820
 cutting to the skin and I reminded the 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.489
 skin like that to free my fish 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.180
 the fish has no skin and peels them 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:13.710
 I did not cut it into pieces I dirty 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:16.520
 and pepper the salmon dice and I 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.350
 place in a baking dish 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:25.460
 I now want sprinkled with shallots 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:33.440
 and I'll cover you with cider that's 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:38.869
 gone for 10 to 15 minutes of cooking and 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:40.479
 will not stay drunk either compared 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.350
 I'll rest it's cooked 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.600

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.320
 comments 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:05.090
 we're going to get the salmon 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.720
 now put the juice to reduce in 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.880
 a saucepan 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:13.340
 we will first filtered when tight 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.200
 two halves I add the saffron and the 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.670
 cream 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.530
 with the staff on the sauce takes a 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.480
 beautiful color and we will be able to do it 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.019
 gently warm up the pieces 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.390
 salmon 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.910
 a few minutes before serving and he 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.590
 only missing the chiseled basil on 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.360
 the salmon so personally I 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.070
 prefers to add it to the end because if 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.269
 we put in the sauce low the heat that 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.810
 you have a little taste so it would 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:37.610
 damage is a bit it would blacken 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.880
 and while we're there why do not we 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.959
