00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 guadeloupe does not have any 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.710
 natural resources in its basement 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.420
 to satisfy this energy need 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.910
 however the trick and know-how 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.080
 passed from generation to generation 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.190
 allow to obtain in two weeks 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.679
 that nature puts ten million years 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.790
 realized the ravel coal fired 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:20.390
 of Deshaies we relive this 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:23.820
 Heritage heritage Guadeloupe makes 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.670
 false bond is a meter the meter 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.810
 fifty that head after that increases 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.329
 like that because before as long as 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.350
 start doing that there was no 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.180
 a lot of matches 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.800
 there was not much choice 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.110
 it was at the moment are far from school 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.640
 like that so in the morning I was going in 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.890
 the small ones because good corner of the fire for 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.129
 light up other dindane dig has gone 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.120
 at the time were searched 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.559
 since the three rocks have left the 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.989
 place to regions or barbecues 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.520
 but if everyone knows the use will appreciate 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.230
 difference in quality between coals 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.699
 that we do not know what are the 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.829
 steps of making charcoal 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.120
 and with meticulousness one must proceed to 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.090
 get great results 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.299
 in the beginning you have to start repairing 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.979
 the location there it's already prepared that 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.760
 takes less time but when it is a 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.430
 cab 9 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.080
 you have to tear things off 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.150
 need to have feet or who are 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.880
 in it is necessary to prepare the ground a 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.909
 little I say I do not say at the level nor at 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.080
 school but in a group way 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.150
 it must be very full it takes 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.400
 that it is good too much and then after 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.770
 starts to bed swing what you 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.360
 see a field like this for that 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.759
 can have a little no news 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.150
 time since it's been almost ten 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:40.040
 years of the and then we continue to put 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:44.360
 see them like that stuffed together 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.360
 it's the biggest and that's it 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:11.250
 and that's good good 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.170
 for example there are small holes 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:18.239
 shots have it does not need move 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:24.120
 we do it well like that like this 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:27.930
 also you eat it well this one 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:35.790
 instead of putting that end there it's not going 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:37.379
 we did not do it like car perfume 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.959
 softwood all varieties of 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:42.810
 beverage stirring thanks to his assembly 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.599
 was we already started working 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.810
 to utter coffin moved concrete to lÃ©dat 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:52.530
 the gt that bring them here unss and 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:57.299
 mangos in his chops quite 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.769
 mahogany complete also be normally 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.870
 we do it with cardboard 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.150
 but before we did that with 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.739
 fire yal pouffer was had like the back but 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.660
 now if we find things like 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:11.670
 that we do not need we can always 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:13.349
 do that you do that you attach 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:18.930
 with a little google that closes like that 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:20.849
 there all along the length of the jargon on 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.810
 start first learn 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:28.079
 some thick with the canvas 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:31.109
 like that if you give 10 in front he 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:38.760
 s need to engage as hysteria and you 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:44.160
 put the mercy sting like that 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:47.959
 the thickness of that to that and you put in 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.959
 the earth the straw his 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:54.459
 and it burns meaning with the voices and the 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:55.510
 earth stay next to the uses of the toule 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.069
 is not essential 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.049
 the essential as we sometimes do in 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.400
 big earth and dress up the whole 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:02.290
 pile of wood of grass leaves or 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.810
 straw and cover it with a good 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.310
 layer of soil must also be spared 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.049
 the openings to circulate the air 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.640
 under the charcoal we can then put 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.019
 the fire and a good week is 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.540
 necessary to collect the fuel 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:15.720
 the product thus obtained is the result 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.280
 precise chemical phenomena 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.739
 when we make charcoal we 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.900
 took care of goods piled up every 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.510
 pieces of wood to prevent them 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.280
 have too much air in contact with the drink is 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.979
 in fact the combustion that is achieved at this 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.840
 moment it is done with a minimum 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:34.360
 of oxygen so there is none 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.660
 enough for all the elements 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.780
 wood can pass then combine with 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.610
 oxygen and in fact we get 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.770
 so basically water vapor 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:48.510
 and instead of carbon dioxide 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.510
 simply carbon
