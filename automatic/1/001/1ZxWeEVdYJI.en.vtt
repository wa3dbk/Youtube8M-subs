00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.500
 Here we have a wish again 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.660
 criticism of the darling christopher 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.470
 Thanks a lot for this 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:16.590
 and that's the movie running scared off 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.189
 the year 2006 exactly told by more 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:29.189
 about it 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:34.010
 Here are a few excerpts of the first 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.010
 The guy was that they disappear 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.220
 I try to live a normal life 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.840
 to lead 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.490
 but I belong to a very 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.320
 dangerous gang I have the task 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.260
 to do away with their dirt 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.110
 No question so far, it went quite well for 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.700
 me 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.990
 I did not think something about my family 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:56.270
 I can not hurt too 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:58.840
 until that night as the pistol 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.840
 disappeared 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.330
 I will find the weapon if I am 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.979
 belong to the hardest aisles in the world 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.330
 Police is not just one 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.799
 hot skinny tommy has so 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.500
 corrupt bulls are dumped when they die 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:14.560
 we do not find you calm down 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.840
 you still find the police you have 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.030
 what I own 38 briefly circulate the domain 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.100
 have won power play since I have 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.409
 I have been refreshed for 300 things 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.840
 do you own the gun is somewhere 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.600
 the whole thing is interesting out there 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.030
 However, I can not cook 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.289
 evil man married 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.759
 that is not what i see when i am 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:35.759
 in my eyes look my pistol 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.950
 Dead can not tell stories 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.159
 wanted to kill me how long cell phone and 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.159
 gravel 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.450
 come on 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.579
 I have never seen the evil 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.579
 I am 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.929
 make him ready 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.929
 you are doing the fracking 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:17.400
 july played by paul walker who has 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.610
 occasionally times so small jobs in 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:24.120
 drug milieu and one evening it comes 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:27.510
 to an escalation with corrupt 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.910
 policemen and die two 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.570
 Police officers and they will both 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.870
 shot 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.580
 He then takes this pistol to himself and 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.820
 hides them at home with the 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.310
 this did happen this is in turn 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.989
 would on the one hand neighbor boys 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.330
 watched and this young cloud the 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.550
 gun and then shoot his 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.890
 violent father with it and 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.300
 hurt him badly 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.750
 yes and that starts in the basics 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.570
 a pretty exciting hunt after 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.880
 this gun exactly is who 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.560
 of course, that the pistol of the 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.300
 police would be ensured and then 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.860
 it is just established that she is him 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.239
 heard that is yes the pistol is with 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.350
 abgeknallt of the two cops 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.310
 were and then he namely a 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.010
 big problem 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.440
 that is basically taken in 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.760
 This movie is actually about hunting 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.769
 It should be dead this night 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.440
 because it is always so rare that he 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.000
 approached by those of the 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.070
 he thinks the pistol says 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.830
 the one maybe yes I have the for 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.280
 sell a few dollars to someone 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.080
 sometime types 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.459
 he also has to go back and 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.650
 had to get out would be then 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:35.220
 relationship hidden around a water crisis 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.200
 and finds help despite help finds the 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.290
 plans again with nose always shortly before 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.790
 the weapon has disappeared again 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.370
 and thus begins a complete 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.070
 hunt for this crappy 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.600
 christrose is hunting right now 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.980
 Also el I find very good staged 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.070
 because he started incredibly fast 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.840
 cut here so with a lot 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.519
 interesting effects also and 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.620
 So no wobbly pictures or something wants 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.630
 not me but it is very fast 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.239
 cuts and and partly so in the 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.420
 thanks to color alienations 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:08.120
 that is already well done 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.770
 say and therefore the ones she incites them 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.349
 the breathlessness is coming 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.790
 you can still do that about it 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:19.970
 beautiful bizarre violence his old wine 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:21.139
 So I would have from 18 but 16 on 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.160
 The cover is also dirty and 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:26.330
 grim so that that fits the movie 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.250
 was also quite a bit with 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.260
 pulp fiction compared but where is 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:36.470
 actually, others caught mostly of 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:39.680
 but he does otherwise 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.630
 more entertaining you have to say he does 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.910
 is not boring through 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.450
 tempo is healed or quieter so 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.550
 exactly 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.370
 it also comes no lengths to reproach 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.830
 you think oh what's up ? 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.070
 so that really quite successful 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.200
 Movie 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.020
 he was not so successful you were 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.970
 yes that was 122 minutes longer where he was two 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.770
 hours 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:03.710
 he had a budget of 15 million us 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.020
 dollar and he has just a total time 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:10.060
 so 9 million million 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:12.169
 recorded loss business was yes 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.640
 interesting is the tv movie has 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:16.729
 Incidentally, counted in the English 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:19.760
 original version becomes 328 times the word 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:21.410
 fuck asked if my german 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.780
 synchro does not happen that often, of course 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:26.419
 but always this is already mature 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:29.270
 performance that's just so to speak 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:30.260
 two three times a minute can not 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.090
 bad that only have to 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.460
 disappoint are the extras there is 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.110
 only the trailershow on it 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.570
 then there are only for me 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.440
 the extras a point the film has me 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.620
 fun 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.610
 entertaining evening loose student 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.969
 need a bit of action 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.709
 be involved 

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:50.099
 everything else you would otherwise want in the calf 

00:05:46.709 --> 00:05:53.009
 an action thriller would also be careful 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:55.469
 points awarded then again in full agreement 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:57.629
 so synonymous makes film of me and extras 

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:58.879
 unfortunately only one point a bit more 

00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:01.289
 would have been better 

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:03.329
 So dear darling christopher 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:06.679
 thank you thank you for the desire criticism 

00:06:03.329 --> 00:06:09.860
 have met and charlotte 

00:06:06.679 --> 00:06:09.860
 See you
