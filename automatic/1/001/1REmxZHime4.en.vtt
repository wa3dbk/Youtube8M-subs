00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.740
 ah 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.660
 hello everyone today in my recipes we are going to 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.209
 learn a trick to cut the potato 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:14.119
 according to what we are going to cook for 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:16.520
 example once we have peeled the 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:18.560
 potatoes we can cut them for omelette 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.320
 for French fries to make them roasted 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.140
 or to put them in a rustic era if 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.090
 let's make potato omelet one of 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.660
 the ways to cut potatoes 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.070
 using the width of the potato as you see 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.930
 we have cut slices 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.450
 and we will have it ready 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.940
 to put in the pan and they are fried and 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:44.360
 stay whole for the tortilla of 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:47.660
 potatoes if we're going to make chips 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.180
 the ideal is to cut the potato first to 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:55.580
 slices and when we have them made to 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:59.000
 we make slices when we 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:01.280
 we cut potatoes it is important that the 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.990
 knife cut well and if possible without 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.640
 that's why we'll get potatoes 

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:10.340
 perfect to accompany a super 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.259
 hamburger for example potatoes for 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.990
 chips a trick is to leave them to 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:17.180
 soak a while because then we have 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.000
 the crispy out of the potato and 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.100
 Inside, we stay and then 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.820
 we have another way of preparing the 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.580
 potatoes that is simply cut to 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.600
 slices we make 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:35.330
 some crosses in the center we put salt 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:39.350
 baked pepper and we'll have to make 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:43.310
 roasted potatoes or we can prepare them to 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:46.160
 tacos to put them on a roast or in 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.170
 any garrison that we go to 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.820
 prepare the oven for example also be 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.820
 they can do so to make them fried 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:59.310
 when we made the taquitos 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.320
 You see we will be done right away this way 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.720
 of cutting the potatoes also serves us 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.940
 when we are going to make Russian salad or 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.489
 we want to cook the potatoes before when 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.619
 the we serve as well in 5 or 10 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.900
 minutes over high heat and boiling water 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.819
 we will have the potatoes already soft and 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.819
 it will take much less than if we make them 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.650
 whole and nothing friends here I leave you 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:23.750
 different ways to enjoy the 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.750
 potatoes until the next kitchen tripod
