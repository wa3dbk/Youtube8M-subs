00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 good idea fisher now even if you finish 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.120
 on the cameras they will not be able to 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.189
 identify you the idea 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.780
 this is from the authorization of the 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.780
 security two are missing 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.210
 we put 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:07.550
 that's where they went 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.330
 now office authorization is needed 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.330
 of the treasurer 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.170
 fine authorization imposed the cage 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.840
 outside of the cable should open in 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.729
 this was achieved inside 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.409
 of the cage you will find a small cable 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.630
 full of safes 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.940
 your friend I left a kit 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.320
 inside one of those 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:12.420
 well I warn you when it came to bed or not 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:16.170
 I wanted to just that I was hoping not to 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.650
 see wanted is a kind of meat in 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.450
 box 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.880
 probably the greatest expert of 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.680
 Computational theory in the world has 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.110
 worked with morgan on the project 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.330
 one are say that she left for the 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.660
 tangent but all this stinks me of 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.760
 bad man the tall and dirty always do 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.230
 the slave always clean always a 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.910
 keep the diaper so you can 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.680
 work or not worry spa 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.630
 will adjust as if mark not admitted 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.510
 nothing better to do than arrange 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.560
 all the gadgets that break 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.560
 now which was that code 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.100
 the ecofin we see what else is there from 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.100
 fix for stage 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.459
 I tell you it was a rat and also for 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.680
 sodium was too big maybe it was one 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.200
 choice 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.790
 1 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.280
 but a bear 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.530
 you're crazy I know that the air intake and 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.450
 big best they are big and anyway 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.730
 a bear would destroy the office of 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.269
 treasurer 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.750
 maybe he was 16 by one of those dear to 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:38.180
 manama bears do not exist 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.120
 maybe he escaped from the zoo you're a 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.890
 imbecile is fixed work still one 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:48.920
 mail and we're fine 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:50.660
 I do my best sam we will part 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.310
 all said the equipment was in 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:59.510
 one of the boxes at 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:04:01.130
 chest right side number 1024 do much 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.440
 attention to equipment 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.630
 what all this stuff is 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.450
 for dogs and the other is a riello 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.640
 telemetry a telemetry pick 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:14.360
 viper I was looking for principal that we will guide 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.650
 we now have to snap both 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.840
 padlocks at the same time 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:21.049
 here's what the lock picker needs 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.810
 telemetry is the law your movements 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.180
 in one lock and limits in the other in 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.940
 real time you guys used gods 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.919
 interesting toys well now 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.590
 when you feel you are in the right place 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:35.150
 for each pin you have to wait a second 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.760
 for the synchronism of lock picks 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.250
 when you hear a beep you can trigger the 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.100
 pin and move to the next one not 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.170
 try to make them go 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.440
 he had seen an inter or I should 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:49.600
 start again well clear now the square 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.730
 charges on the main pins when they are 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.390
 all right but I think you know 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.390
 what to do 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.730
 without lamberto we are of very good quality 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:04.020
 work 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.020
 enter and find those discs 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.580
 I found fragments of a message from 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:21.420
 a guy called bora 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:25.390
 and the sky has nothing on him does not wait 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:28.690
 and spray what the deleted messages 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:30.130
 I have 512 bit encryption I do n't have 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.620
 most viewed from the times of threads 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:36.520
 mass killed but out of strict 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.930
 mons remember and it is confirmed then yes 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.930
 it's about someone accessing 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:43.570
 decidedly secret information sought 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.400
 is a possibility that scares me is the 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.080
 steady job 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.180
 now the theft investigation will focus 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.610
 straight to the same investigators 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.530
 and so the Panamanian government will send in 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.120
 prison some innocent bankers yes 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.800
 he is innocent 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.360
 if we exclude the supply of weapons to the 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:04.300
 revolutionaries it is right to forget it 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:07.060
 bad bankers is the fisher work 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:09.640
 now the vision will seem like a steal not 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:12.640
 they'll never know why we were here lambert 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.770
 now that I have 50 million dollars in hand 

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:18.880
 I think we should still talk about 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:22.360
 that increase 25 I feel now and not a 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.700
 penny of more problem I accept well if 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.040
 we can proceed with the extraction from 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:30.100
 landmark the courtyard wall 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:33.300
 front exact rating waiting for you there 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.300
 I'm coming up close 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:52.450
 the municipalities
