loosened up all the bolts you can see
here's<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.270> radiator<00:00:48.270> hose<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:49.160> that<00:00:50.160> was<00:00:50.340> the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
here's a radiator hose and that was the

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.510 
here's a radiator hose and that was the
lower<00:00:51.059> radiator<00:00:51.360> hose<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:52.710> connects<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.309> the

lower radiator hose that connects to the

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.840 
lower radiator hose that connects to the
lower<00:00:53.730> side<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.680> water<00:00:55.680> pump<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.730> I've

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
lower side of the water pump so I've

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.819 
lower side of the water pump so I've
already<00:00:57.149> drained<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.600> out<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.109> you'll<00:00:58.620> see

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
already drained that out and you'll see

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.889 
already drained that out and you'll see
you<00:00:59.160> can<00:00:59.340> see<00:00:59.520> down<00:00:59.730> below<00:00:59.789> you<00:01:00.510> might<00:01:00.690> be<00:01:00.809> able

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
you can see down below you might be able

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.170 
you can see down below you might be able
to<00:01:01.050> see<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.289> catch<00:01:01.469> basin<00:01:01.980> that's<00:01:02.699> important

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
to see the catch basin that's important

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.549 
to see the catch basin that's important
to<00:01:03.239> have<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.570> catch<00:01:03.809> basin<00:01:04.260> in<00:01:04.379> there

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
to have that catch basin in there

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.390 
to have that catch basin in there
because<00:01:04.710> built<00:01:05.339> radiator<00:01:06.290> antifreeze<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:08.220> the

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
because built radiator antifreeze on the

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.100 
because built radiator antifreeze on the
floor<00:01:08.640> if<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.880> got<00:01:09.030> dogs<00:01:09.299> or<00:01:09.510> cats<00:01:09.720> if<00:01:09.990> they

floor if you got dogs or cats if they

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.740 
floor if you got dogs or cats if they
lick<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.560> it'll<00:01:10.830> kill<00:01:11.100> them<00:01:11.450> so<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.540> want<00:01:12.630> to

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
lick that it'll kill them so you want to

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.050 
lick that it'll kill them so you want to
make<00:01:12.900> sure<00:01:12.930> it's<00:01:13.170> all<00:01:13.320> caught<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.890> cleaned<00:01:14.880> up

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
make sure it's all caught and cleaned up

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.910 
make sure it's all caught and cleaned up
before<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.689> allow<00:01:15.869> your<00:01:16.080> animals<00:01:16.500> back<00:01:16.740> in

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
before you allow your animals back in

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.649 
before you allow your animals back in
the<00:01:17.009> garage

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
the garage

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:23.630 
the garage
also<00:01:18.680> let<00:01:19.680> me<00:01:19.710> grab<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.220> light<00:01:20.670> here<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:22.640> this

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
also let me grab the light here and this

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.260 
also let me grab the light here and this
around<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.240> can<00:01:24.330> see<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.479> better<00:01:24.630> shot<00:01:26.270> so

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
around so you can see a better shot so

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.910 
around so you can see a better shot so
again<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.290> can<00:01:28.380> see<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.619> power-steering

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
again you can see the power-steering

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.060 
again you can see the power-steering
chassis<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.820> off<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.180> side<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.990> we<00:01:31.890> did

removing the heater hose which is also
connected<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.079> water<00:01:49.290> pump<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:49.890> I

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
connected to the water pump and you I

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.530 
connected to the water pump and you I
don't<00:01:50.490> know<00:01:50.549> if<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.729> see<00:01:50.909> if<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.180> can<00:01:51.329> see

way to gain access to that heater hose

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.350 
way to gain access to that heater hose
is<00:02:06.840> again<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:08.009> use<00:02:08.220> your<00:02:08.550> breaker<00:02:09.239> bar

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
is again to use your breaker bar

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.520 
is again to use your breaker bar
and<00:02:10.690> your<00:02:12.270> move<00:02:13.270> that<00:02:13.480> tensioner<00:02:14.020> arm<00:02:14.260> back

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
and your move that tensioner arm back

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.430 
and your move that tensioner arm back
out<00:02:14.950> of<00:02:15.100> the<00:02:15.160> way<00:02:15.340> and<00:02:16.050> that'll<00:02:17.050> give<00:02:17.200> you<00:02:17.380> more

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
out of the way and that'll give you more

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.810 
out of the way and that'll give you more
access<00:02:17.980> to<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:19.480> water<00:02:19.750> pump<00:02:20.020> okay<00:02:20.620> so<00:02:21.460> now

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
access to the water pump okay so now

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.100 
access to the water pump okay so now

if you didn't move back away here just a
little<00:03:18.100> bit<00:03:18.280> I<00:03:18.660> don't<00:03:19.660> know<00:03:19.840> if<00:03:19.930> you<00:03:19.989> can<00:03:20.140> see

little bit I don't know if you can see

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.979 
little bit I don't know if you can see
all<00:03:20.440> that<00:03:20.650> or<00:03:20.769> not<00:03:20.920> but<00:03:21.510> we're<00:03:22.510> gonna<00:03:22.630> go<00:03:22.780> ahead

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
all that or not but we're gonna go ahead

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:30.570 
all that or not but we're gonna go ahead
and<00:03:24.450> make<00:03:25.450> sure<00:03:25.480> all<00:03:25.840> these<00:03:27.180> Torx<00:03:28.180> head<00:03:29.580> bolts

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
and make sure all these Torx head bolts

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.509 
and make sure all these Torx head bolts
are<00:03:30.940> loose<00:03:31.000> and<00:03:31.590> they're<00:03:32.590> all<00:03:32.709> lit<00:03:32.980> just<00:03:33.459> a

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
are loose and they're all lit just a

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.170 
are loose and they're all lit just a
matter<00:03:33.700> of<00:03:33.870> and<00:03:34.870> we<00:03:34.959> got<00:03:35.110> to<00:03:35.200> get<00:03:35.350> them<00:03:35.440> out<00:03:36.180> of

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
matter of and we got to get them out of

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.880 
matter of and we got to get them out of
the<00:03:37.269> way<00:03:37.420> so<00:03:37.480> we<00:03:37.780> can<00:03:37.989> pull<00:03:38.170> the<00:03:38.260> water<00:03:38.500> pump

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
the way so we can pull the water pump

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:47.910 
the way so we can pull the water pump
off<00:03:42.750> sometimes<00:03:46.170> we're<00:03:47.170> going<00:03:47.230> to<00:03:47.500> loosen<00:03:47.680> the

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
off sometimes we're going to loosen the

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:54.900 
off sometimes we're going to loosen the
hole<00:03:48.100> up<00:03:50.640> if<00:03:51.640> we<00:03:51.820> walk<00:03:52.060> down<00:03:52.239> there<00:03:53.280> okay<00:03:54.280> so<00:03:54.760> it

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
hole up if we walk down there okay so it

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:55.860 
hole up if we walk down there okay so it
looks<00:03:55.090> like<00:03:55.150> we're<00:03:55.360> going<00:03:55.450> to<00:03:55.540> have<00:03:55.630> to<00:03:55.720> use

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
looks like we're going to have to use

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:02.430 
looks like we're going to have to use
the<00:03:57.810> 10.7<00:03:58.840> along<00:03:59.680> with<00:03:59.950> the<00:04:00.989> socket<00:04:01.989> extension

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
the 10.7 along with the socket extension

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.340 
the 10.7 along with the socket extension
I<00:04:04.019> can<00:04:05.019> find<00:04:05.320> the<00:04:05.500> socket<00:04:05.890> extension<00:04:07.260> what<00:04:08.260> did

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
I can find the socket extension what did

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.720 
I can find the socket extension what did
I<00:04:08.470> do<00:04:08.530> with<00:04:10.590> what<00:04:11.590> I<00:04:11.620> did<00:04:11.890> with<00:04:12.070> it<00:04:12.220> I<00:04:12.489> think

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
I do with what I did with it I think

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.740 
I do with what I did with it I think
it's<00:04:14.730> around<00:04:15.730> here<00:04:15.850> somewhere<00:04:16.239> now<00:04:16.540> that's

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
it's around here somewhere now that's

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.770 
it's around here somewhere now that's
the<00:04:16.870> breaker<00:04:17.080> bar<00:04:17.380> I<00:04:17.620> think<00:04:18.489> this<00:04:18.640> might<00:04:19.209> might

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
the breaker bar I think this might might

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.520 
the breaker bar I think this might might
be<00:04:19.900> too<00:04:20.140> long<00:04:20.380> it<00:04:20.590> is

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
be too long it is

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:28.100 
be too long it is
oh<00:04:23.480> no<00:04:24.480> what<00:04:24.600> I<00:04:24.630> did<00:04:24.870> with<00:04:25.080> it<00:04:26.360> here<00:04:27.360> nope

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
oh no what I did with it here nope

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.260 
oh no what I did with it here nope
well<00:04:28.889> let<00:04:29.070> me<00:04:29.160> see<00:04:29.310> if<00:04:29.370> this'll<00:04:29.550> work<00:04:30.030> let's

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
well let me see if this'll work let's

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:36.040 
well let me see if this'll work let's
see<00:04:31.280> get<00:04:32.280> down<00:04:32.490> there

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.090 

fortunately<00:04:37.050> it's<00:04:37.200> loose<00:04:37.410> enough<00:04:37.440> that<00:04:37.980> we

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
fortunately it's loose enough that we

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.760 
fortunately it's loose enough that we
don't<00:04:38.280> need<00:04:38.430> a<00:04:39.230> extension<00:04:40.230> it's<00:04:40.380> just<00:04:40.560> kind<00:04:40.740> of

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
don't need a extension it's just kind of

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.990 
don't need a extension it's just kind of
