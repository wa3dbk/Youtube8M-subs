00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:15.830
 of batista70phone here are two other covers 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:19.550
 for iphone 5 5 s here we have a classic 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:22.039
 bumper as you all know well with the 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.500
 transparent side part and inserts 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.660
 in black 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.240
 let's see how it fits 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.239
 obviously very tight 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.610
 first on this side we make it adhere 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.059
 well i'm a bit hampered on these 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.180
 what's this 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:40.850
 ok as you can see according to what 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.399
 we press well on this side now 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.500
 it is perfectly adherent we have a 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:48.440
 minimum of frontal protection since 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.149
 the glass does not directly support the same 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.340
 side part also for what concerns 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.430
 the meat a minimum of protection 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:58.160
 here we have the volume keys 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:01.340
 raised beaver here for the mood well 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.620
 accessible start button 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.780
 Standby off above 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:10.300
 on this side we have nothing apart 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:15.130
 lower well covered with various speakers 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:16.800
 three and a half jack and light input 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.710
 well 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.170
 visible the back is obviously not 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.060
 covered but we still repeat a 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.370
 minimum of protection we say this is the 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.590
 minimum protection to right for not 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.810
 support it directly and to have one 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.930
 good grip now I'll show you 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.480
 another type of bumper we go to 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.750
 unplug this trying not to 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.610
 damaging nothing really adheres 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.560
 very well this is another kind of 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.820
 bumper but the plastic back of 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.370
 consequently we have a greater 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.190
 protection this green color but we have 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.170
 practically all the various colors like 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.990
 you can see a fluo green that goes a lot 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.360
 This year we have fashion shows here too 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.950
 volume keys covered but easily accessible 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.410
 and the miur button 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.390
 the same as the key used to switch off the stand 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.149
 by this side completely covered 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.370
 keys below is covered but with 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.880
 accessible entrances 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:18.180
 the camera is as well protected as you can 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:22.530
 see in short we say a similar bumper 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:25.110
 with the back in pvc 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.720
 transparent that leaves anyway to see 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.050
 lamela and a minimum of protection 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.900
 also providing let's say a fluorescent effect 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.190
 which is very fashionable this year with 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.470
 this ended especially washing 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.470
