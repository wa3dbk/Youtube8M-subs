00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
after back surgery you can do it also on

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.710 
after back surgery you can do it also on
a<00:04:22.510> ball<00:04:22.900> and<00:04:23.710> you<00:04:23.980> can<00:04:24.130> also<00:04:24.310> add<00:04:24.760> variation<00:04:25.510> to

a ball and you can also add variation to
it<00:04:25.840> which<00:04:26.530> is<00:04:28.350> when<00:04:29.350> you<00:04:29.470> extend<00:04:29.890> your<00:04:30.010> arms
