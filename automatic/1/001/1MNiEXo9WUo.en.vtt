00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello to all who visit the page 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.020
 web prepare yourself this video 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.840
 is dedicated to distinguish and that you know 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.840
 recognize the difference between a filter 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:18.020
 network input power 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.020
 washing machine or dishwasher and a condenser 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.180
 in many cases I have had consultations in 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.400
 the forum that so you do not know 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.950
 distinguish the difference of a filter 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.960
 with a capacitor the difference that 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.590
 you have to observe between a filter and a 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.170
 capacitor is that the capacitor 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.239
 it only has two terminals instead 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.600
 the network filter as you can see 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:44.600
 has many more terminals have the 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:48.290
 two 220 input terminals and the 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.750
 two 220 output terminals is to say 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.660
 the voltage would come in here and over here 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.489
 would feed the machine 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:58.059
 all this connector here is a sheet 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:01.630
 of grounding where they would be derived 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:03.890
 the small peaks on tensions or 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.380
 small interferences that there may be 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.149
 in the electric current so much that 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.220
 produce in the stream as you can 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:12.920
 generate the machine since the function of 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.200
 a network filter is both protect the 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.500
 electronic plate of impurities 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.600
 electric that can come through the network 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.340
 external as the impurities that 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.010
 can generate the motor of the washing machine 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.690
 mainly with the dishwasher 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.240
 and that can get them out to the network 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.280
 electric 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.259
 if we look at the network filter scheme 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.170
 all network filters usually carry 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:38.380
 a scheme on a lateral side we see 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.770
 which has 1 and 2 would be the 3 entries and 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:45.850
 4 would be the outputs has a small 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:49.119
 resistance between the two deliveries a 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.640
 capacitor and at the output we have the 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:55.509
 intermediate tap which is the grounding 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.250
 and two capacitors that would derive to the 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.759
 Grounding the small impurities 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.280
 therefore inside this small boat 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.200
 we have four components 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.929
 We will check and we will see as sale and 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.049
 the entrances and exits have to 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:13.209
 have an electrical continuity and how 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:17.550
 you can try it we can try it with 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:19.370
 a polymer in ohm scale 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.850
 i 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.850
 if we measure the king 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.130
 entries we will see that it gives a certain 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.010
 resistance since we have a 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:35.349
 parallel resistance 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.349
 well it would be better said with the entry 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:45.040
 It is not giving a measure d 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:47.210
 0.6 less that is 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:52.090
 6000 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:52.090
 forgiveness 663 ohms 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:59.560
 again a measure of six hundred 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:02.590
 sixty-three changes 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:06.450
 if we measure in network 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:10.260
 entrance and exit gives us a measure 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.260
 also in mega ohms 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.210
 we see that this post is 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.770
 corresponds to this output 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:26.060
 and if we invest 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.870
 we see that this entry 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.359
 but mios 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:35.760
 corresponds to this output with the other 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:42.080
 output will give us a high resistance of 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:45.650
 663 ohm meabe changes sorry 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.120
 therefore we have an easy way to 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.410
 could distinguish which is the entrance 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.410
 when is the direct output 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.280
 She is serious 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.520
 and this would be the other entry with the 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.460
 chance 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.100
 but mios 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:06.190
 A typical failure of this element is that 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:08.680
 cracking on one side produce 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.770
 sparks and we do not have a continuity 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.630
 electrical between the entrance and the exit 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:16.180
 that is , at the input we have voltage 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.100
 but on the way out we have nothing or 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.860
 we have a much lower voltage so 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.510
 both the filter would be damaged too 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.690
 we can determine if it is 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.430
 damaged because it would overheat 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.290
 excessively and commented that 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.200
 some sparks would come out or we would see 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:34.150
 some small smoke come out of it 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.430
 I hope this video can be 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.910
 statement and when you will meet with 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:43.440
 a network filter a capacitor either 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:46.380
 in any of its different aspects 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:49.360
 you know distinguish what one has two 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.729
 connectors the other has many more 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.189
 characters 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:57.930
 Greetings and I hope you keep visiting 

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:57.930
