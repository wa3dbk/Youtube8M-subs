00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349 
never know i mean my schedule is really

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:27.309 
never know i mean my schedule is really
busy<00:03:24.650> in<00:03:24.920> there<00:03:25.660> but<00:03:26.660> it's<00:03:26.780> one<00:03:26.959> of<00:03:27.050> the<00:03:27.140> races

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
busy in there but it's one of the races

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:29.860 
busy in there but it's one of the races
that<00:03:27.620> is<00:03:27.800> kind<00:03:28.190> of<00:03:28.280> I<00:03:28.730> would<00:03:29.090> say<00:03:29.209> in<00:03:29.480> my<00:03:29.629> top

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
that is kind of I would say in my top

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.380 
that is kind of I would say in my top
ten<00:03:30.110> of<00:03:30.140> races<00:03:30.739> of<00:03:30.890> giving<00:03:31.190> so<00:03:31.489> it's<00:03:32.209> possible

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
ten of races of giving so it's possible

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.360 
ten of races of giving so it's possible
outcome<00:03:33.019> that<00:03:33.200> you<00:03:33.680> raised<00:03:33.920> all<00:03:34.129> over<00:03:34.280> the

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
outcome that you raised all over the

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.360 
outcome that you raised all over the
world<00:03:34.489> how<00:03:35.239> does<00:03:35.420> this<00:03:35.569> race<00:03:35.989> rate<00:03:36.500> as<00:03:36.800> far<00:03:37.250> as

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
world how does this race rate as far as

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.220 
world how does this race rate as far as
competition<00:03:37.610> and<00:03:38.300> as<00:03:38.390> far<00:03:38.569> as<00:03:38.630> the<00:03:38.989> course

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
competition and as far as the course

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.020 
competition and as far as the course
itself<00:03:39.590> yeah<00:03:40.220> i<00:03:40.250> think<00:03:40.400> the<00:03:40.610> course<00:03:40.880> is

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
itself yeah i think the course is

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.660 
itself yeah i think the course is
actually<00:03:41.300> one<00:03:41.420> of<00:03:41.450> the<00:03:41.540> heart<00:03:41.780> out<00:03:42.140> of<00:03:42.200> course

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
actually one of the heart out of course

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.339 
actually one of the heart out of course
not<00:03:43.670> because<00:03:43.790> it's<00:03:44.120> a<00:03:44.239> steepest<00:03:44.630> one<00:03:44.810> I<00:03:44.840> do<00:03:44.959> but

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:45.349 
not because it's a steepest one I do but

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:47.680 
not because it's a steepest one I do but
when<00:03:45.830> you're<00:03:45.950> running<00:03:46.099> on<00:03:46.250> a<00:03:46.310> road<00:03:46.549> race<00:03:46.760> you

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
when you're running on a road race you
