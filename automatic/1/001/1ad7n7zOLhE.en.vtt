want the best quality of headphones
I<00:01:40.920> think<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.520> 50s<00:01:42.090> have<00:01:42.270> three<00:01:42.630> presets

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
I think the a 50s have three presets

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.620 
I think the a 50s have three presets
which<00:01:43.560> are<00:01:43.770> gaming<00:01:44.009> movies<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.360> third

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
which are gaming movies and the third

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.569 
which are gaming movies and the third
one<00:01:45.840> enhances<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.649> treble<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.340> that's

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
one enhances the treble and that's

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.580 
one enhances the treble and that's
usually<00:01:47.880> hearing<00:01:48.659> footsteps<00:01:48.869> in<00:01:49.380> Call<00:01:49.560> of

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
usually hearing footsteps in Call of

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.889 
usually hearing footsteps in Call of
Duty<00:01:49.710> okay<00:01:50.159> now<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.880> earpieces<00:01:51.329> they<00:01:51.720> have

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
Duty okay now to the earpieces they have

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.139 
Duty okay now to the earpieces they have
great<00:01:52.470> quality<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.369> comfort<00:01:53.700> both

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
great quality and comfort both

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.179 
great quality and comfort both
headphones<00:01:54.659> do<00:01:54.930> but<00:01:55.290> they<00:01:55.470> are<00:01:55.500> different

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
headphones do but they are different

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.219 
headphones do but they are different
style<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.700> think<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:57.119> Astros<00:01:57.600> have<00:01:57.810> memory

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229

foam<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.950> elites<00:01:59.250> have<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.729> same<00:02:00.000> but

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
foam and the elites have the same but

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.609 
foam and the elites have the same but

beats<00:02:29.620> but<00:02:29.980> one<00:02:30.129> of<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.340> best<00:02:30.610> features<00:02:30.879> of

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
beats but one of the best features of

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.869 
beats but one of the best features of
the<00:02:31.629> elites<00:02:31.989> is<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.410> Bluetooth<00:02:32.920> mode<00:02:33.310> where

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
play video games at the same time I like

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.619 
play video games at the same time I like
the<00:02:38.739> music<00:02:38.920> feature<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.700> most<00:02:40.000> though<00:02:40.329> but

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:40.629 
the music feature the most though but

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:42.569 
the music feature the most though but
the<00:02:40.720> Astro<00:02:41.260> doesn't<00:02:41.829> have<00:02:42.040> that<00:02:42.370> many

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
the Astro doesn't have that many

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.640 
the Astro doesn't have that many
features<00:02:42.909> but<00:02:43.360> it's<00:02:43.540> still<00:02:43.810> a<00:02:43.870> great<00:02:44.110> headset

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
features but it's still a great headset

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.800 
features but it's still a great headset
if<00:02:44.829> you<00:02:44.920> just<00:02:45.190> like<00:02:45.400> doing<00:02:45.730> mo<00:02:46.030> g<00:02:46.239> or<00:02:46.450> ranked

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
if you just like doing mo g or ranked

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.440 
if you just like doing mo g or ranked
play<00:02:47.019> on<00:02:47.230> call<00:02:47.470> of<00:02:47.590> duty<00:02:47.890> but<00:02:48.099> this<00:02:48.430> is<00:02:48.790> just<00:02:49.209> my

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
play on call of duty but this is just my

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.630 
play on call of duty but this is just my
opinion<00:02:49.599> I<00:02:50.079> like<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.709> elites<00:02:51.040> better<00:02:51.370> than

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
opinion I like the elites better than

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.699 
opinion I like the elites better than
the<00:02:51.760> Astros<00:02:52.329> just<00:02:52.930> because<00:02:53.260> they<00:02:53.410> have<00:02:53.500> more

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
the Astros just because they have more

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.830 
the Astros just because they have more
features<00:02:53.920> with<00:02:54.340> them<00:02:54.579> but<00:02:54.849> like<00:02:55.030> I<00:02:55.239> said<00:02:55.540> it's

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
features with them but like I said it's

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.020 
features with them but like I said it's
just<00:02:55.989> my<00:02:56.470> opinion<00:02:56.950> it<00:02:57.129> does<00:02:57.400> not<00:02:57.579> matter<00:02:57.819> if

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
just my opinion it does not matter if

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.970 
just my opinion it does not matter if
you<00:02:58.209> pick<00:02:58.450> either<00:02:58.660> one<00:02:58.810> you<00:02:59.560> don't<00:02:59.709> have<00:02:59.829> to

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
you pick either one you don't have to

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.589 
you pick either one you don't have to
