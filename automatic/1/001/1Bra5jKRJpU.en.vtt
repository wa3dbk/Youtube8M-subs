shot of my ends and they looked hard and

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.919 
shot of my ends and they looked hard and
that's<00:00:14.009> because<00:00:14.490> I<00:00:14.700> wear<00:00:15.030> my<00:00:15.179> hair<00:00:15.420> in<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.660> puff

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
that's because I wear my hair in a puff

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.010 
that's because I wear my hair in a puff
about<00:00:16.560> three<00:00:16.980> days<00:00:17.279> out<00:00:17.609> of<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.820> week<00:00:18.020> and

about three days out of the week and
that<00:00:19.949> is<00:00:20.130> not<00:00:20.340> good<00:00:20.580> for<00:00:20.609> my<00:00:21.029> end<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:21.779> tried<00:00:22.289> to
