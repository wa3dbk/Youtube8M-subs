00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.610

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.490
 who I am 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:19.299

 polished and that is this here that a wisteria 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:25.990
 the blue that also recalls the 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:29.620
 color of wool and then this green 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:34.180
 tiffany this is very nice here 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:37.360
 let's start right away from the mi palettina 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:40.360
 really, really liked it a lot 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.510
 compared to the pop art I had tried 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:46.450
 I've tried these from the collection 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:49.270
 vamp and in short they don't have me 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:52.870
 excited you have seen the review 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:55.480
 found both here on the youtube channel is 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.130
 found the review all the other pop art 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.720
 on the blog 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.120
 I liked very much the 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:06.510
 eye shadows are slightly dusty but 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:11.020
 really very little if you are dull 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:14.380
 very pigmented velvets apply 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:18.460
 good time fades well 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:21.449
 I am absolutely positive review 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:25.529
 very nice the color of 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:29.939
 of this liquid eyeliner does not make me 

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:34.379
 go crazy the little brush that I find a little 

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:39.419
 too a little too soft is a bit 

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:44.309
 too soft I like it a little more 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:46.650
 more rigid because I think it's a bit 

00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:49.860
 more complicated than a hand 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.819
 really stop applying it and do one 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.889
 straight line 

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:55.680
 so I recommend it for who it is 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:58.529
 an expert also because the color is 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:01.529
 really beautiful really very beautiful 

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:03.120
 instead my sore point for what 

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:06.509
 regards this re collection among the 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:10.789
 things I've tried there is nothing else 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:15.839
 the lipsticks then beautiful colors 

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:22.169
 very beautiful opaque pigmented intense 

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:25.229
 excellent opacity but really dry 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:29.210
 lips and it's something I didn't notice 

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:34.830
 with the hours I don't know after a little while 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:37.349
 immediately applies it is already a bit mushy 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.699
 applying it is not really not slips 

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:40.889
 very good on the lips 

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:46.360
 the effect is very beautiful this effect 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:49.520
 opaque however it is 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:53.270
 after a while I know how to give a little annoyance 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:55.340
 on the lips it can be remedied by applying 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:58.430
 a lip balm on top however 

00:06:55.340 --> 00:07:01.790
 end it is going to ruin what it is 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:03.650
 the paco effect of lipstick obviously 

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:05.360
 if you have already bought it and you want it 

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:08.780
 I recommend to solve the problem 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:11.270
 apply tapping over some 

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:15.530
 lip balm a very light veil 

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:16.730
 of shiny lip gloss and that's it 

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:19.040
 as usual I hope they found 

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:21.170
 this saw this saw this idea 

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.940
 I totally hope that as usual 

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:27.880
 you found the review and the tutorial 

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:27.880
 useful and I send you a big hello kiss
