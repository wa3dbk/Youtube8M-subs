00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.820
 yes hello and welcome dear 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.370
 friends my name stefan court of sg 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.080
 akustik haifa studio in karlsruhe 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.810
 Today I want to give you something completely 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.990
 the b &amp; b 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.720
 w 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.550
 nautilus the clock snail we here 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.579
 build in our customer's home 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.189
 The B &amp; W Nautilus was in the early 90s 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:29.039
 Years developed by Lorenz 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:33.450
 Dicky who was in the 80s 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.820
 matrix housing established namely with 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.980
 the 801 matrix also in many 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.770
 studios was used immediately 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.320
 But loki was not happy with it 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.390
 the conventional housing concepts and 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.010
 continued to research the watch models 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.070
 the nautilus as pictured here 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.320
 can see already pointed out that 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.480
 there would be a snail because of this 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:00.210
 Optimal resonance damping equally 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:06.420
 good maximum frequency expansion 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:09.390
 means the nautilus was later too 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.570
 as a base used for today too 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.370
 legendary 800 series from b &amp; w where many 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.860
 the parts of the nautilus namely these 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.260
 Aperiodic muted hear Ford set 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.450
 for example , came to use 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.640
 the nautilus is even though it is today 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.640
 Some years on the market is like 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.100
 in front of a unique and unique 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.600
 time far ahead 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.880
 today we came here to the 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.280
 nautilus in the home of our customer too 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.620
 Unfortunately, do not install the weather 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.600
 especially good as you on the recordings 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.370
 looks a bit painstaking the 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.950
 to bring speakers into the house 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.290
 but that was spent then and so 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.860
 they were lifted out of their boxes and 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:53.940
 put on her pedestal 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.560
 the nautilus itself is technological 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.580
 highly interesting you can see that here 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:03.020
 even with the expansion recordings finest 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.610
 Finish and the technique with the 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.860
 periodically muffled horn continue 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.970
 namely the later so -called cars 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.560
 technology also made visible the 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.010
 loudspeakers are equipped is a 4 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.159
 walks construction with four full 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:22.819
 Aluminum chassis in bass range for 1 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:25.489
 300 mm full aluminum chassis one 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:30.049
 midrange a beautiful for the top 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:31.700
 in the middle and a tweeter the trends 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.730
 Frequently interesting basket 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.010
 at up to 120 hertz and the midrange drivers 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:41.150
 decoupled at 880 heart at three and a half 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:45.890
 kilo heart blaspheme the tweeter from the 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:48.409
 entire construction we also here 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.590
 A good view is in the form of an ammonite 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:54.049
 running on grill which has enormous advantages 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.250
 has as far as the resonance fight 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:58.099
 because there are no are no 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.750
 standing waves in the housing the whole 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:03.650
 housing does not matter what its shape is 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.900
 is very uncomplicated is from grp 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.659
 This is a glass reinforced 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.849
 Plastics therefore a fiberglass reinforced 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:12.709
 plastic additionally also one 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.329
 but enormous rigidity is also right 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.870
 the speaker is so light 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:20.349
 altogether only 45 kilo and becomes from one 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.090
 five of the 50 kilograms 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:24.889
 the granite-like pedestal held the 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.720
 But just like the granite 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:28.609
 Material is a compper and material 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.959
 Tera too similar to what is essential 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:33.109
 higher steam and sometimes higher 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.449
 density than the pure stone materials 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:36.879
 does not give that high attenuation either 

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:39.530
 but have too much resonance 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:41.810
 would produce the nautilus 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:45.290
 Interestingly, fully active 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.810
 Here you can see the frequency soft per 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.879
 box we have a frequency divider the 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.129
 also assigned to the serial numbers 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:56.510
 become 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:58.970
 through the active frequency divider instead 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.709
 a passive crossover reach 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.669
 I have a tremendous efficiency of the chassis 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.419
 and therefore needs less 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:06.620
 gaining power overall 

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:08.120
 a finer appeal of the 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.620
 speakers and leads to this 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.709
 incredible frequency response which the 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.709
 nautilus has the is linear at 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:17.959
 plus / minus 1 db namely between 20 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.579
 hertz and 20 kilohertz so actually 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.190
 in the area one of us as 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:24.380
 audibly acknowledges the speaker's power 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.450
 but at minus 6 db still 10 hertz 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.230
 in the deep what is totally unique that 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.460
 lies at this open 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:34.980
 system which no compression effect 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:39.270
 or limitation we realize stuck 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:41.580
 now the ones in the rhine symmetrical 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.860
 applied connectors here from 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.970
 the frequency divider to the power amplifier for 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.320
 I need the speaker then 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.030
 Of course, also per channel 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.030
 the four final stages around the individual 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:55.380
 chassis so to drive 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:57.960
 the result of the whole story if 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.630
 the cabling is done we have 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.140
 By the way, a pure silver wiring 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.310
 which is directly from the individual chassis 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:08.820
 running from the speaker and 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.620
 here in these ends they are here 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.240
 see and these are now without synonymous 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.270
 more cable shoes or plugs the 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.250
 Here is a contact resistance 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:21.090
 could be unfavorable 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.680
 she bolted directly into the power amp 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.520
 see that here we are using 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:29.460
 here in the case class about 5300 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:32.280
 multi-channel power amps each one per 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.770
 speakers the amplifiers afford 300 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.470
 watt per channel and have a lot too 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.910
 high class starting operation possible here 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.700
 is and probably also at the 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:44.610
 loud in full trains for use 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:47.100
 is that we screwed now here 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.410
 the whole cable ends and then the can 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:52.200
 fun actually start with 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:55.110
 the b &amp; w nautilus is a true b &amp; w 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:57.000
 gesamtkunstwerk succeeded what is still today 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.370
 probably also for the future of 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.820
 Benchmark for many other speakers 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:06.800
 will be the whole construction the 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:09.620
 also in terms of appearance like a 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:12.750
 incredibly beautifully processed culture 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:16.560
 also has an elongated 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:19.710
 result which is unparalleled 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:22.620
 what playback is so fast 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:24.919
 open loose and deep rich as 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:27.030
 is rarely heard and through the 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:29.370
 total construction in the middle and 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:32.460
 High pitch is one of openness 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:35.160
 a room picture possible the far away 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:39.830
 that is what we are used to otherwise 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:42.270
 it is a certain emotional 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.919
 The basic structure here in the sound with 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:47.220
 one is transferred to others 

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:49.919
 loudspeakers to this day in vain 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:53.729
 yes dear friends that's it already 

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:56.160
 with our snail's holiday plus from 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:58.800
 b &amp; w that was really something 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.910
 special what we showed here today 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.310
 I hope it was fun 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:04.590
 and they are the next time again 

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:07.639
 doing so when we get our high end 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.639
 introduce components
