like bedlam people were running all over
the<00:02:38.260> place<00:02:38.530> so<00:02:38.950> I<00:02:38.980> ran<00:02:39.580> to<00:02:39.790> to<00:02:40.510> Parsons<00:02:41.020> and<00:02:41.320> you

know I just sort of took my pad out and

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.000 
know I just sort of took my pad out and
I<00:02:43.720> started<00:02:44.110> drawing<00:02:44.260> because<00:02:44.470> we<00:02:44.680> I<00:02:44.709> mean<00:02:44.980> I

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
I started drawing because we I mean I

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.160 
I started drawing because we I mean I
could<00:02:45.220> see<00:02:45.400> it<00:02:45.489> I<00:02:45.580> looked<00:02:45.820> down<00:02:45.970> down<00:02:46.870> Fifth

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
could see it I looked down down Fifth

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.560 
could see it I looked down down Fifth
Avenue<00:02:47.320> and<00:02:47.820> actually<00:02:48.820> the<00:02:48.940> one<00:02:49.150> tower<00:02:49.360> had

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
Avenue and actually the one tower had

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.449 
Avenue and actually the one tower had
already<00:02:49.720> fallen<00:02:50.110> while<00:02:50.440> I<00:02:50.500> was<00:02:50.709> in<00:02:50.920> the<00:02:51.220> subway

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
already fallen while I was in the subway

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.199 
already fallen while I was in the subway
I<00:02:51.820> didn't<00:02:52.810> really<00:02:53.170> think<00:02:53.380> about<00:02:54.370> it<00:02:54.580> in<00:02:54.940> terms

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
I didn't really think about it in terms

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.449 
I didn't really think about it in terms
of<00:02:55.570> gee<00:02:56.320> I<00:02:56.530> guess<00:02:56.739> I<00:02:56.890> should<00:02:57.100> draw<00:02:57.280> this

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
of gee I guess I should draw this

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:58.860 
of gee I guess I should draw this
because<00:02:57.790> it's<00:02:57.940> important<00:02:58.360> it<00:02:58.450> was<00:02:58.540> just<00:02:58.750> more

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
because it's important it was just more

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.850 
because it's important it was just more
instinctive<00:02:59.200> you<00:02:59.769> know<00:02:59.890> and<00:03:01.049> so<00:03:02.049> I<00:03:02.080> just<00:03:02.530> sort

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
instinctive you know and so I just sort

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.940 
instinctive you know and so I just sort
of<00:03:02.950> kept<00:03:03.790> drawing<00:03:04.090> and<00:03:04.360> walking<00:03:04.810> and<00:03:05.019> I<00:03:05.530> think

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
of kept drawing and walking and I think

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.949 
of kept drawing and walking and I think
in<00:03:06.040> a<00:03:06.130> way<00:03:06.340> it<00:03:06.850> helped<00:03:07.120> me<00:03:07.209> to<00:03:07.239> process<00:03:07.540> what

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
in a way it helped me to process what

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.660 
in a way it helped me to process what
was<00:03:08.080> going<00:03:08.320> on<00:03:08.470> I<00:03:08.739> started<00:03:09.340> drawing<00:03:09.489> the

over<00:03:58.060> I<00:03:58.270> think<00:03:58.480> that<00:03:58.660> a<00:03:58.930> rabbit<00:03:59.890> artist<00:04:00.670> even

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.210 
over I think that a rabbit artist even

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:02.910 
over I think that a rabbit artist even
more<00:04:01.450> so<00:04:01.630> than<00:04:01.780> a<00:04:01.810> photographer<00:04:02.530> right

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
more so than a photographer right

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.830 
more so than a photographer right
someone<00:04:03.550> who's<00:04:03.700> illustrating<00:04:04.330> junior<00:04:04.600> effort

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
someone who's illustrating junior effort

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.730 
someone who's illustrating junior effort
ah<00:04:04.930> you<00:04:05.830> have<00:04:06.130> to<00:04:06.270> be<00:04:07.270> present<00:04:07.840> you<00:04:07.930> can't<00:04:08.380> just

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:08.740 
ah you have to be present you can't just

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.800 
ah you have to be present you can't just
grab<00:04:08.950> it<00:04:09.070> and<00:04:09.280> go<00:04:09.460> because<00:04:10.090> you<00:04:10.270> have<00:04:10.300> to<00:04:10.630> make

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
grab it and go because you have to make

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.750 
grab it and go because you have to make
the<00:04:10.960> drawing<00:04:11.170> so<00:04:11.530> you<00:04:11.590> become<00:04:12.010> involved<00:04:12.340> in<00:04:12.670> a

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
the drawing so you become involved in a

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.000 
the drawing so you become involved in a
way<00:04:13.000> that<00:04:13.420> maybe<00:04:13.810> other<00:04:14.110> people<00:04:14.260> don't<00:04:14.620> become

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
way that maybe other people don't become

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.830 
way that maybe other people don't become
involved<00:04:15.250> and<00:04:15.580> you<00:04:15.850> capture<00:04:16.390> those<00:04:16.510> kind<00:04:16.780> of

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
involved and you capture those kind of

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.330 
involved and you capture those kind of
moments<00:04:16.959> and<00:04:17.410> those<00:04:17.680> kind<00:04:17.890> of<00:04:17.920> moments<00:04:18.040> are

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
moments and those kind of moments are

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.400 
moments and those kind of moments are
important<00:04:18.730> because<00:04:18.820> I<00:04:19.000> think<00:04:19.150> they<00:04:19.540> they

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
important because I think they they

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.310 
important because I think they they
really<00:04:20.829> bring<00:04:21.160> the<00:04:21.760> humanity<00:04:22.330> to<00:04:22.630> a<00:04:22.660> situation

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
really bring the humanity to a situation

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:30.110 
really bring the humanity to a situation
like<00:04:23.440> that

00:04:37.619 --> 00:04:37.629 
you're starting to get into this idea of

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:39.779 
you're starting to get into this idea of
what<00:04:37.930> the<00:04:38.050> drawing<00:04:38.229> should<00:04:38.590> be<00:04:38.770> and<00:04:39.580> you're

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:39.789 
what the drawing should be and you're

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:41.489 
what the drawing should be and you're
not<00:04:39.969> experiencing<00:04:40.659> it<00:04:40.779> and<00:04:40.900> drawing<00:04:41.259> is<00:04:41.409> an

00:04:41.489 --> 00:04:41.499 
not experiencing it and drawing is an

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:44.339 
not experiencing it and drawing is an
experience<00:04:42.069> that's<00:04:42.550> the<00:04:43.419> first<00:04:43.749> and<00:04:44.110> foremost

00:04:46.739 --> 00:04:46.749 
thing it is and it's very spontaneous

you<00:05:12.939> know<00:05:13.060> sometimes<00:05:13.389> people<00:05:13.479> will<00:05:13.719> say<00:05:13.839> where

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
you know sometimes people will say where

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.679 
you know sometimes people will say where
do<00:05:14.139> you<00:05:14.199> start<00:05:14.439> a<00:05:14.589> drawing<00:05:14.860> and<00:05:15.539> for<00:05:16.539> me

00:05:16.679 --> 00:05:16.689 
do you start a drawing and for me

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:18.209 
do you start a drawing and for me
there's<00:05:16.900> no<00:05:17.020> real<00:05:17.169> answer<00:05:17.529> to<00:05:17.560> that<00:05:17.830> because

00:05:18.209 --> 00:05:18.219 
there's no real answer to that because

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:20.640 
there's no real answer to that because
it<00:05:18.639> just<00:05:18.819> involves<00:05:19.360> so<00:05:19.810> I<00:05:19.839> start<00:05:20.289> wherever<00:05:20.469> I

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
it just involves so I start wherever I

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.800 
it just involves so I start wherever I
start<00:05:20.979> and<00:05:21.129> then<00:05:21.270> one<00:05:22.270> thing<00:05:22.479> leads<00:05:22.719> to

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
start and then one thing leads to

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.269 
start and then one thing leads to
another<00:05:22.900> and<00:05:23.349> it's<00:05:23.439> more<00:05:23.650> organic

00:05:24.269 --> 00:05:24.279 
another and it's more organic

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:27.480 
another and it's more organic
I<00:05:24.310> love<00:05:24.879> illustration<00:05:25.599> I<00:05:25.810> love<00:05:26.139> reportage<00:05:26.680> I'm

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
I love illustration I love reportage I'm

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.939 
I love illustration I love reportage I'm
really<00:05:27.969> excited<00:05:28.330> about<00:05:28.770> some<00:05:29.770> of<00:05:29.830> the

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:29.949 
really excited about some of the

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:32.219 
really excited about some of the
projects<00:05:30.490> that<00:05:30.520> Reppert<00:05:30.909> is<00:05:31.300> leading<00:05:31.659> me<00:05:31.749> to<00:05:31.960> I

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:32.229 
projects that Reppert is leading me to I

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:35.010 
projects that Reppert is leading me to I
think<00:05:32.259> that<00:05:32.669> dal<00:05:33.669> vero<00:05:33.939> could<00:05:34.240> grow<00:05:34.539> because

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
think that dal vero could grow because

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.570 
think that dal vero could grow because
you<00:05:35.319> know<00:05:35.439> the<00:05:35.649> students<00:05:36.039> who<00:05:36.129> are<00:05:36.219> in<00:05:36.339> that

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
you know the students who are in that

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.490 
you know the students who are in that
school<00:05:37.029> are<00:05:37.330> young<00:05:38.050> but<00:05:38.319> they're

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
school are young but they're

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.230 
school are young but they're
professionals<00:05:39.069> so<00:05:39.279> I<00:05:39.310> think<00:05:39.580> that<00:05:39.879> that<00:05:40.060> can

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
professionals so I think that that can

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.209 
professionals so I think that that can
grow<00:05:40.509> as<00:05:40.659> well<00:05:40.870> and<00:05:41.080> become<00:05:41.379> like<00:05:41.589> this<00:05:41.800> kind

00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:42.219 
grow as well and become like this kind

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:46.110 
grow as well and become like this kind

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
of movement of art based on repperton

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.579
