easter<00:00:05.640> egg<00:00:05.850> for<00:00:06.509> EXO<00:00:06.990> zombies<00:00:07.140> so<00:00:07.980> while<00:00:08.610> the

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
easter egg for EXO zombies so while the

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.759 
easter egg for EXO zombies so while the
main<00:00:08.940> objective<00:00:09.450> of<00:00:09.630> this<00:00:09.840> mode<00:00:10.110> is<00:00:10.139> to<00:00:10.440> simply

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
main objective of this mode is to simply

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.770 
main objective of this mode is to simply
survive<00:00:11.070> as<00:00:11.280> many<00:00:11.580> rounds<00:00:11.790> as<00:00:12.030> possible<00:00:12.599> I

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
survive as many rounds as possible I

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.839 
survive as many rounds as possible I
also<00:00:13.200> think<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.920> main<00:00:14.070> easter<00:00:14.490> egg<00:00:14.670> is

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
also think the main easter egg is

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.400 
also think the main easter egg is
actually<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.450> allow<00:00:15.599> you<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:16.170> get<00:00:16.289> out<00:00:16.379> of

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
actually to allow you to get out of

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.170 
actually to allow you to get out of
there<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:16.890> survived<00:00:17.340> which<00:00:17.730> is<00:00:17.880> kind<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.119> cool

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
there and survived which is kind of cool

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.760 
there and survived which is kind of cool
so<00:00:18.480> check<00:00:18.660> out<00:00:18.750> this<00:00:18.900> treatment<00:00:19.199> right<00:00:19.439> here

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
so check out this treatment right here

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.070 
so check out this treatment right here
it's<00:00:20.130> called<00:00:20.369> game<00:00:20.730> over<00:00:21.180> man<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.900> the

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
it's called game over man and the

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.140 
it's called game over man and the
description<00:00:22.350> says<00:00:22.740> call<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.400> rescue<00:00:23.939> and

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
description says call and a rescue and

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.029 
description says call and a rescue and
it's<00:00:24.510> worth<00:00:24.689> fifty<00:00:25.109> gamerscore<00:00:25.470> so<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:25.949> think

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
it's worth fifty gamerscore so I think

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.640 
it's worth fifty gamerscore so I think
this<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.820> kind<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.390> like<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.689> reward<00:00:28.109> for

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
this is kind of like the reward for

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.740 
this is kind of like the reward for
completing<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:29.310> easter<00:00:29.670> egg<00:00:29.849> now<00:00:30.150> I've<00:00:30.630> been
