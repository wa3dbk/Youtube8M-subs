show you the box and really the only

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.250 
show you the box and really the only
thing<00:00:22.890> is<00:00:23.220> on<00:00:23.460> this<00:00:23.699> side<00:00:24.000> which<00:00:24.510> is<00:00:24.539> just<00:00:24.750> the

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
thing is on this side which is just the

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.650 
thing is on this side which is just the
label<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:26.340> show<00:00:26.369> which<00:00:26.730> model<00:00:27.180> you're<00:00:27.359> getting

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
label to show which model you're getting

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.179 
label to show which model you're getting
and<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.019> serial<00:00:28.320> number<00:00:29.449> everything<00:00:30.449> else

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
and the serial number everything else

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.639 
and the serial number everything else
fairly<00:00:32.189> simple<00:00:32.520> if<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.850> knew<00:00:33.030> how<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.329> read

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
fairly simple if you knew how to read

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.209 
fairly simple if you knew how to read
Chinese<00:00:34.649> you<00:00:34.890> could<00:00:35.040> probably<00:00:35.309> figure<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.700> out

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
Chinese you could probably figure it out

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.369 
Chinese you could probably figure it out
but<00:00:38.219> everything<00:00:38.550> else<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.910> very<00:00:39.270> simple<00:00:40.079> just

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
but everything else is very simple just

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.810 
but everything else is very simple just
like<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.739> poker<00:00:40.950> 2<00:00:41.219> box

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.770 

the<00:00:44.600> interior<00:00:46.089> you<00:00:47.089> receive<00:00:47.690> a<00:00:48.019> mini<00:00:48.469> b2

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
the interior you receive a mini b2

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.959 
the interior you receive a mini b2
normal<00:00:50.829> USB<00:00:51.829> and<00:00:52.989> that<00:00:53.989> is<00:00:54.229> a<00:00:54.649> 1.5<00:00:55.370> meter<00:00:55.699> cable

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
normal USB and that is a 1.5 meter cable

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:03.310 
normal USB and that is a 1.5 meter cable
which<00:00:56.870> is<00:00:57.050> almost<00:00:57.199> 5<00:00:57.530> feet<00:01:00.909> also<00:01:01.909> you<00:01:02.899> receive

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
which is almost 5 feet also you receive

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:16.770 
which is almost 5 feet also you receive
a<00:01:04.869> single<00:01:05.920> key<00:01:06.920> here<00:01:08.860> which<00:01:09.860> has<00:01:10.130> a<00:01:10.369> chipmunk

and you can check it out there's quite a
bit<00:01:28.820> of<00:01:29.000> programming<00:01:29.360> features<00:01:30.110> as<00:01:30.380> that's

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
bit of programming features as that's

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.130 
bit of programming features as that's
the<00:01:30.830> new<00:01:30.979> thing<00:01:31.450> just<00:01:32.450> like<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:32.690> poker<00:01:32.900> -

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140

they're<00:01:33.380> adding<00:01:33.710> programming<00:01:34.340> to<00:01:34.460> the<00:01:34.490> race<00:01:34.700> -

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.340 

and<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:41.030> keyboard<00:01:41.390> itself<00:01:41.720> let's<00:01:42.110> remove

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
and the keyboard itself let's remove

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.450

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.420 

and<00:01:47.750> there<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:48.810> have<00:01:48.870> it<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.710> one

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
and there you have it so it is one

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.120 
and there you have it so it is one
single<00:01:50.760> row<00:01:51.120> taller<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.810> one<00:01:52.409> single<00:01:52.770> row

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
single row taller and one single row

wider<00:01:53.729> than<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.750> poker<00:01:54.960> -<00:01:55.490> however<00:01:56.490> you

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
wider than the poker - however you

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.300 
wider than the poker - however you

there<00:03:36.299> may<00:03:36.690> be<00:03:36.720> a<00:03:37.110> PPT<00:03:37.560> version<00:03:38.100> coming<00:03:38.670> soon

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
there may be a PPT version coming soon

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.270 
there may be a PPT version coming soon
as<00:03:39.299> I<00:03:40.170> was<00:03:40.320> reading<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.650> manual<00:03:40.950> and<00:03:41.190> it

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
as I was reading the manual and it

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.539 
as I was reading the manual and it
appears<00:03:41.760> so<00:03:42.560> this<00:03:43.560> also<00:03:43.890> has<00:03:44.070> a<00:03:44.100> dual<00:03:44.370> layer

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
appears so this also has a dual layer

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.910 
appears so this also has a dual layer
PCB<00:03:45.239> so<00:03:45.750> that's<00:03:46.040> pretty<00:03:47.040> good<00:03:47.220> as<00:03:48.150> always<00:03:48.390> and

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
PCB so that's pretty good as always and

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.590 
PCB so that's pretty good as always and
that's<00:03:49.920> about<00:03:50.040> it<00:03:50.190> for<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:50.880> unboxing<00:03:51.390> other

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
that's about it for the unboxing other

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.570 
that's about it for the unboxing other
than<00:03:51.870> just<00:03:52.380> dimensions<00:03:52.890> and<00:03:53.070> weight<00:03:53.190> which<00:03:53.430> I

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
than just dimensions and weight which I

00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:00.059 
than just dimensions and weight which I
will<00:03:53.730> show<00:03:53.940> you

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.570 

I'll<00:04:01.069> plot<00:04:01.459> my<00:04:01.700> handi<00:04:02.120> scale<00:04:03.049> here<00:04:03.409> so<00:04:04.400> the

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
I'll plot my handi scale here so the

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.729 
I'll plot my handi scale here so the
poker<00:04:04.790> -<00:04:05.060> without<00:04:05.330> the<00:04:05.720> fancy<00:04:05.989> aluminum<00:04:06.530> case

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
poker - without the fancy aluminum case

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.300 
poker - without the fancy aluminum case
weighed<00:04:07.040> 20<00:04:07.760> point<00:04:08.150> 77<00:04:08.900> ounces<00:04:09.069> and<00:04:10.069> you'd<00:04:10.220> be

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
weighed 20 point 77 ounces and you'd be

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.460 
weighed 20 point 77 ounces and you'd be
surprised<00:04:10.790> to<00:04:11.060> find<00:04:11.269> out<00:04:11.450> that<00:04:11.720> this<00:04:12.230> keyboard

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
surprised to find out that this keyboard

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.750 
surprised to find out that this keyboard
actually<00:04:13.040> weighs<00:04:13.250> almost<00:04:14.000> 2<00:04:14.390> ounces<00:04:14.720> less<00:04:15.760> so

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
actually weighs almost 2 ounces less so

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.479 
actually weighs almost 2 ounces less so
if<00:04:17.510> that<00:04:17.750> makes<00:04:17.959> a<00:04:18.079> difference<00:04:18.350> to<00:04:18.530> you<00:04:18.590> that's

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
if that makes a difference to you that's

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:20.439 
if that makes a difference to you that's
interesting

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:20.449 
interesting

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:24.250 
interesting
I<00:04:22.330> guess<00:04:23.330> I<00:04:23.449> should<00:04:23.600> show<00:04:23.750> you<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:23.900> bottom

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
I guess I should show you the bottom

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.250 
I guess I should show you the bottom
here<00:04:24.470> you<00:04:25.070> have<00:04:25.100> four<00:04:25.669> slippy<00:04:26.270> grippy<00:04:27.080> feet

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
here you have four slippy grippy feet

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.530 
here you have four slippy grippy feet
rather<00:04:27.710> when<00:04:28.610> you're<00:04:28.760> four<00:04:29.060> dip<00:04:29.300> switches

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540
