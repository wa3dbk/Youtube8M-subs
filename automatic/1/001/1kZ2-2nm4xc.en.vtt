will<00:02:01.850> cut<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.970> wire<00:02:05.150> so<00:02:06.150> now<00:02:06.300> you<00:02:06.360> have<00:02:06.660> most

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
will cut the wire so now you have most

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.320 
will cut the wire so now you have most
your<00:02:07.080> wire<00:02:07.230> on<00:02:07.410> this<00:02:07.560> side<00:02:07.860> no<00:02:08.700> wire<00:02:08.880> over<00:02:09.030> here

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
your wire on this side no wire over here

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.850 
your wire on this side no wire over here
is<00:02:09.390> what<00:02:09.540> we<00:02:09.630> want<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.869> do<00:02:09.930> is<00:02:10.050> kind<00:02:10.380> of<00:02:10.530> balance

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
is what we want to do is kind of balance

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.010 
is what we want to do is kind of balance
it<00:02:10.950> out<00:02:11.100> before<00:02:11.430> we<00:02:11.460> start<00:02:11.820> this<00:02:12.000> so<00:02:12.930> we're

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
it out before we start this so we're

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.050 
it out before we start this so we're
going<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.170> flip<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.100> switch<00:02:14.280> down<00:02:14.490> which<00:02:14.820> put

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
going to flip the switch down which put

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.570 
going to flip the switch down which put
the<00:02:15.180> motor<00:02:15.330> in<00:02:15.450> Reverse<00:02:16.280> run<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.370> speed

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
the motor in Reverse run the speed

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.750 
the motor in Reverse run the speed
control<00:02:17.970> up<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.950> move<00:02:19.950> about<00:02:20.160> half<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.580> wire

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
control up I move about half the wire

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.670 
control up I move about half the wire
back<00:02:21.060> over<00:02:21.390> so<00:02:21.510> now<00:02:21.630> we've<00:02:21.780> got<00:02:21.930> equal<00:02:22.320> amounts

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
back over so now we've got equal amounts

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.490 
back over so now we've got equal amounts
of<00:02:22.710> wire<00:02:22.890> roughly<00:02:23.630> so<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.840> motor<00:02:25.020> does<00:02:25.230> move

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
of wire roughly so the motor does move

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.600 
of wire roughly so the motor does move
to<00:02:25.710> allow<00:02:25.920> tension<00:02:26.430> as<00:02:26.550> you<00:02:27.020> push<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.610> screen

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
to allow tension as you push the screen

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.380 
to allow tension as you push the screen
in<00:02:29.820> this<00:02:29.910> rolling<00:02:30.620> plate<00:02:31.620> forward<00:02:32.330> we're<00:02:33.330> at

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
in this rolling plate forward we're at

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.750 
in this rolling plate forward we're at
58<00:02:33.840> degrees<00:02:34.170> so<00:02:34.350> this<00:02:34.470> actually<00:02:34.800> isn't<00:02:34.920> up<00:02:35.490> to

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
58 degrees so this actually isn't up to

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.600 
58 degrees so this actually isn't up to
temperature<00:02:36.210> but<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.170> basic<00:02:37.530> setup<00:02:37.740> is<00:02:38.040> this

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
temperature but the basic setup is this

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.600 
temperature but the basic setup is this
is<00:02:38.790> an<00:02:38.910> iPhone<00:02:39.210> 4<00:02:39.570> or<00:02:40.280> separating<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.400> glass

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
is an iPhone 4 or separating the glass

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.420 
is an iPhone 4 or separating the glass
and<00:02:41.910> we'd<00:02:42.000> actually<00:02:42.230> go<00:02:43.230> in<00:02:43.410> between<00:02:43.800> the<00:02:44.250> two

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
and we'd actually go in between the two

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.160 
and we'd actually go in between the two
cables<00:02:46.640> and<00:02:47.640> go<00:02:47.820> over<00:02:47.970> that<00:02:48.090> loop<00:02:48.330> and<00:02:48.540> we<00:02:48.750> you

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
cables and go over that loop and we you

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.900 
cables and go over that loop and we you
kind<00:02:49.380> of<00:02:49.440> manually<00:02:49.890> get<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.220> wire<00:02:50.400> set<00:02:50.790> up

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
kind of manually get the wire set up

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.080 
kind of manually get the wire set up
right<00:02:51.150> below<00:02:51.390> or<00:02:52.080> right<00:02:52.260> between<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:53.580> LCD

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
right below or right between the the LCD

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.630 
right below or right between the the LCD
and<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:54.680> digitizer<00:02:55.680> actually<00:02:56.100> on<00:02:56.190> an<00:02:56.310> iPhone

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
and the digitizer actually on an iPhone

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.020 
and the digitizer actually on an iPhone
4<00:02:57.140> at<00:02:58.140> that<00:02:58.350> point<00:02:58.650> you<00:02:59.430> want<00:02:59.610> to<00:02:59.700> bring<00:02:59.880> this

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
4 at that point you want to bring this

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.380 
4 at that point you want to bring this
into<00:03:00.270> the<00:03:00.390> forward<00:03:00.690> position<00:03:01.910> now<00:03:02.910> your<00:03:03.120> timer

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
into the forward position now your timer

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.180 
into the forward position now your timer
is<00:03:03.570> kicking<00:03:03.900> back<00:03:04.080> you<00:03:04.260> can<00:03:04.410> adjust<00:03:04.739> this<00:03:04.980> this

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
is kicking back you can adjust this this

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.770 
is kicking back you can adjust this this
is<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.489> sawing<00:03:05.700> motion<00:03:06.239> as<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:06.450> motor

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
is the sawing motion as the motor

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.560 
is the sawing motion as the motor
reverses<00:03:07.320> and<00:03:07.610> then<00:03:08.610> once<00:03:08.790> you<00:03:08.940> begin<00:03:09.239> to<00:03:09.420> turn

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
reverses and then once you begin to turn

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.650 
reverses and then once you begin to turn
the<00:03:09.720> speed<00:03:09.930> control<00:03:10.290> up<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.709> about<00:03:11.660> where

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
the speed control up to about where

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.330 
the speed control up to about where
we've<00:03:12.870> had<00:03:13.020> some<00:03:13.080> success<00:03:13.680> is<00:03:13.860> right<00:03:13.980> about<00:03:14.160> to

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
we've had some success is right about to

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.470 
we've had some success is right about to
the<00:03:14.430> green<00:03:14.640> light<00:03:14.670> which<00:03:14.940> i<00:03:15.060> think<00:03:15.120> is<00:03:15.300> about

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
the green light which i think is about

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.229 
the green light which i think is about
35<00:03:16.200> on<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.560> speed<00:03:16.770> control<00:03:17.190> and<00:03:17.400> at<00:03:18.090> that

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
35 on the speed control and at that

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.870 
35 on the speed control and at that
point<00:03:18.540> once<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:18.780> temperatures<00:03:19.320> up<00:03:19.880> you'll

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
point once the temperatures up you'll

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.960 
point once the temperatures up you'll
start<00:03:21.180> to<00:03:21.330> just<00:03:21.510> push<00:03:22.080> this<00:03:22.320> forward<00:03:22.620> and<00:03:23.040> let

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
start to just push this forward and let

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.940 
start to just push this forward and let
the<00:03:24.060> wire<00:03:24.239> do<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.570> work<00:03:24.750> we're<00:03:25.680> not<00:03:25.769> the

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
the wire do the work we're not the

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.170 
the wire do the work we're not the
temperature<00:03:26.430> so<00:03:26.580> it's<00:03:26.760> not<00:03:26.910> going<00:03:27.120> to

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
temperature so it's not going to

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.170 
temperature so it's not going to
actually<00:03:28.140> remove<00:03:28.680> it<00:03:28.769> at<00:03:28.890> this<00:03:29.010> time<00:03:29.180> but

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
actually remove it at this time but

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.350 
actually remove it at this time but
that's<00:03:30.360> the<00:03:30.510> basic<00:03:30.870> controls<00:03:31.880> that<00:03:32.880> turns<00:03:33.209> it

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
that's the basic controls that turns it

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.810 
that's the basic controls that turns it
off<00:03:34.010> Center<00:03:35.010> is<00:03:35.070> kind<00:03:35.280> of<00:03:35.340> neutral<00:03:35.670> and

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
off Center is kind of neutral and

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.190 
off Center is kind of neutral and
everything<00:03:36.150> so<00:03:36.390> you<00:03:36.450> do<00:03:36.600> need<00:03:36.750> a<00:03:36.810> lot<00:03:36.930> of<00:03:36.989> heat

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
everything so you do need a lot of heat

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.300 
everything so you do need a lot of heat
up<00:03:37.320> to<00:03:37.440> temperature<00:03:37.830> and<00:03:37.860> you'll<00:03:38.040> have<00:03:38.160> to

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
up to temperature and you'll have to

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.430 
up to temperature and you'll have to
adjust<00:03:39.239> that<00:03:39.420> according<00:03:39.840> to<00:03:39.930> what<00:03:40.080> you<00:03:40.200> find

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
adjust that according to what you find

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.310 
adjust that according to what you find
feel<00:03:40.800> works<00:03:41.040> best
