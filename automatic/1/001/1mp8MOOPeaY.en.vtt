your<00:03:33.150> arm<00:03:33.569> and<00:03:33.840> digging<00:03:34.109> here<00:03:34.350> so<00:03:34.889> it's<00:03:35.010> kind

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
your arm and digging here so it's kind

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.800 
your arm and digging here so it's kind
of<00:03:35.220> annoying<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:35.790> for<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.239> price<00:03:36.480> of<00:03:36.660> it<00:03:36.750> I

other things on Bill Me Later so based

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.050

on<00:04:29.400> how<00:04:29.550> much

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
on how much

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.060 
on how much
an<00:04:30.120> item<00:04:30.360> cost<00:04:30.780> that's<00:04:31.169> how<00:04:31.350> many<00:04:31.590> months<00:04:31.980> you

to<00:05:00.419> have<00:05:00.450> a<00:05:00.540> good<00:05:00.810> credit<00:05:01.110> to<00:05:01.139> qualify<00:05:01.440> for<00:05:01.860> it

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
to have a good credit to qualify for it

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.430 
to have a good credit to qualify for it

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
but it definitely is a good program I

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.830 
but it definitely is a good program I
