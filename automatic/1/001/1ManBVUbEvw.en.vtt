00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
from where you spawn in lumbridge it's a

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.849 
from where you spawn in lumbridge it's a
really<00:00:18.510> nice<00:00:18.690> quest<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.140> just<00:00:19.350> start<00:00:19.529> out<00:00:19.680> as<00:00:19.830> a

really nice quest to just start out as a
very<00:00:20.100> first<00:00:20.340> quest<00:00:20.640> because<00:00:20.939> it's<00:00:21.180> quite<00:00:21.420> easy

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
talisman to start out the quest which

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.630 
talisman to start out the quest which
you're<00:00:28.650> supposed<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:28.980> take<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.340> wizard's

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
you're supposed to take to the wizard's

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.550 
you're supposed to take to the wizard's
tower<00:00:29.730> but<00:00:30.480> if<00:00:30.570> you<00:00:30.660> just<00:00:30.810> drop<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.260> you<00:00:31.380> can

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
tower but if you just drop it you can

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.280 
tower but if you just drop it you can
use<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.830> drop<00:00:32.099> trick<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:33.090> pretty<00:00:33.840> much<00:00:33.960> get<00:00:34.170> an

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
use the drop trick to pretty much get an

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.740 
use the drop trick to pretty much get an
infinite<00:00:34.649> supply<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.160> them<00:00:35.399> if<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.329> have<00:00:36.690> them

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
infinite supply of them if you have them

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.420 
infinite supply of them if you have them
in<00:00:36.899> your<00:00:36.989> bank<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.380> won't<00:00:37.559> give<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:38.010> but

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
in your bank you won't give you it but

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.400 
in your bank you won't give you it but
if<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.120> put<00:00:39.450> if<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:39.780> note<00:00:39.960> them<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.290> leave

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
if you put if you note them and leave

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.350 
if you put if you note them and leave
them<00:00:40.440> in<00:00:40.680> your<00:00:40.770> inventory<00:00:41.190> then<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:42.000> cannot

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
them in your inventory then you cannot

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.360 
them in your inventory then you cannot
just<00:00:42.719> leave<00:00:42.899> in<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.110> near<00:00:43.260> inventory<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.860> get

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
just leave in the near inventory and get

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.970 
just leave in the near inventory and get
more<00:00:44.489> from<00:00:44.670> them<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.480> there's<00:00:45.960> not<00:00:46.170> really<00:00:46.530> all

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
more from them so there's not really all

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.010 
more from them so there's not really all
that<00:00:47.039> or<00:00:47.940> it's<00:00:48.090> not<00:00:48.239> really<00:00:48.450> such<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.629> big<00:00:48.840> deal

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
that or it's not really such a big deal

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.810 
that or it's not really such a big deal
because<00:00:49.260> their<00:00:49.680> talismans<00:00:50.160> aren't<00:00:50.489> really

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
because their talismans aren't really

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.450 
because their talismans aren't really
worth<00:00:51.000> all<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.300> much<00:00:51.570> but<00:00:52.320> it's<00:00:52.710> yeah<00:00:53.190> sort

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
worth all that much but it's yeah sort

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.400 
worth all that much but it's yeah sort
of<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.579> cool<00:00:53.730> thing<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:54.690> after<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.960> get<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.230> air

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
of a cool thing so after you get the air

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.410 
of a cool thing so after you get the air
talisman<00:00:55.890> from<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.250> Duke<00:00:56.430> then<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.090> head

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
talisman from the Duke then you head

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.500 
talisman from the Duke then you head
over<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.469> wizard's<00:00:59.340> tower<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.879> it's<00:01:00.420> a

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
over to the wizard's tower and it's a

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.790 
over to the wizard's tower and it's a
bit<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.780> walk<00:01:00.960> but<00:01:01.140> it's<00:01:01.350> not<00:01:01.500> too<00:01:01.680> bad

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
bit of a walk but it's not too bad

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.529 
bit of a walk but it's not too bad
really<00:01:02.010> just<00:01:02.309> make<00:01:03.120> sure<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.420> don't

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
really just make sure that you don't

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.000 
really just make sure that you don't
bring<00:01:03.750> anything<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.290> mind<00:01:04.530> losing

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
bring anything that you mind losing

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.039 
bring anything that you mind losing
because<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.610> easiest<00:01:06.000> way<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.210> get<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.930> the

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
because the easiest way to get to the

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.230 
because the easiest way to get to the
next<00:01:07.080> but<00:01:07.470> after<00:01:07.740> this<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:08.010> just<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.310> die<00:01:08.340> so

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
next but after this is just to die so

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.190 
next but after this is just to die so
just<00:01:09.540> go<00:01:09.960> upstairs<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.350> tak<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.799> Wizards<00:01:11.130> and

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
just go upstairs and tak the Wizards and

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.570 
just go upstairs and tak the Wizards and
eventually<00:01:13.200> they'll<00:01:13.290> hopefully<00:01:13.560> kill<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.100> if

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
eventually they'll hopefully kill you if

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.749 
eventually they'll hopefully kill you if
you're<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.790> low-level<00:01:15.119> anyway<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:16.250> so<00:01:17.250> then

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
you're a low-level anyway and so then

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.520 
you're a low-level anyway and so then
after<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.420> die<00:01:18.600> then<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:18.930> have<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.170> run<00:01:19.290> all

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
after you die then you have to run all

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.170 
after you die then you have to run all
the<00:01:19.650> way<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.799> varick<00:01:20.159> which<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.640> another<00:01:20.909> bit

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
the way to varick which is another bit

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.390 
the way to varick which is another bit
of<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.330> run<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.659> as<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.619> can<00:01:22.740> see<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.890> picked<00:01:23.280> up

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
of a run and as you can see I picked up

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.460 
of a run and as you can see I picked up
some<00:01:23.460> random<00:01:23.880> stuff<00:01:24.060> along<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.479> way<00:01:24.509> so<00:01:25.380> you

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
some random stuff along the way so you

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.020 
some random stuff along the way so you
talked<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.770> Aubree<00:01:25.799> in<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.280> rune<00:01:26.460> shop<00:01:26.729> and

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
talked to Aubree in the rune shop and

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.210
