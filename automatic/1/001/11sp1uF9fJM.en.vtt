00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.119
 Ali Baba

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.010
 thought you put it big not 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.010
 fat tail 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:02.760
 you didn't even know that little shit 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.040
 about it well yes it goes to unicast which 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.600
 rescued equestria several times became 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.180
 alicorn and princesses 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.479
 what lives tree library because she 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:17.130
 such a mother and about inconspicuous distract me 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:21.200
 so listen it's to die about it 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.200
 it’s too early sometime pdf 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.200
 glory will belong only to me here 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.630
 that everyone’s head spinning 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.520
 child in this series is not weak of course 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.100
 good man but we are talking about another 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.170
 glory g with celebrity and hide it 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.270
 oh so hard from the more when you and 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.550
 so undermines the map of yelling and seversk 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.650
 What is harder to keep this secret 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.240
 the meaning of the series is that even if you don’t 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.550
 chatting with some famous 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.950
 the individual is better left 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.290
 it's a secret because if you start 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.060
 preying on us lari some nose and then 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.920
 the risk of losing one's own one very quickly 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.650
 never comrades but what is the most 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.290
 regrettable when guilty to realize 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.570
 it ’s usually a mistake to be late 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.209
 not everyone is willing to forgive as a beast and 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.670
 will be a very long time the subject will be you 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.120
 for this mistake which he made for the sake of 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.120
 fame 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.390
 ronikon type was 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.319
 that he threw a series of it more than 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.359
 realistic as here is the launch of this series 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:57.109
 she just vomits and throws her release 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:59.150
 past because for me it's just 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:02.150
 here is the revelation was this series 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.790
 confirmed that I just guessed 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.700
 but what about it could not express it 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.159
 she expressed what is obvious graph and 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.780
 In principle, I think that everyone who does not 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:16.180
 has at least some 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:20.139
 known in this world this series will seem 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:23.870
 now I will explain why every single day 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:26.090
 I receive a letter until it is 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.810
 of course great and I answer these 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:32.090
 Letters to the best of your abilities 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.519
 However , the crush on the parrot is not surprised 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.069
 which i 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:40.579
 which is more than sarik andreasyan and 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:43.790
 I'm beginning to be afraid of them after this time 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:46.970

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:50.359

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:54.370
 just people who write 20 usually this 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:54.370

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.240
 will need 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.920
 and everything would be fine but after another around 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:16.459
 message bars incessant ask 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:16.850

 the dog is already required but the general essence of 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.200
 for the fact that I have something for them but already 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.050
 There were cases when I was asked 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:35.050

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.050
