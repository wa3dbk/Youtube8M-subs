00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:06.210
 Leukocytes and lymphocytes 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:14.289
 There are 5 types of white blood cells 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:18.560
 With or without pouring, with meteor leucocytes 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:25.450
 It can be divided into meteorological stars white blood cells 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:28.690
 Granulocytes are divided into three types depending on how their color is dyed 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:35.070
 Downstream intracellular staining 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:41.410
 It is divided into neutrophil eosinophil basophils 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:45.910
 6 downstream are classified as lymphocytes and monocytes 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:48.820
 Leukocyte strike class is the most frequent 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:55.570
 Account for over 50% 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:01:02.160
 The quest is about 5% lymphocytes or 35% 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:02.160
 There are very few eosinophils and basophils 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.460
 lymphocytes 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.460
 t cells and b cells 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:19.060
 Lymphocytes are born in the bone marrow 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:21.900
 Differentiation from all functional stem cells to lymphoid stem cells begins 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:28.240
 You adjacent lymph 9 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:33.540
 It is divided into b lymphocytes and hear lymphocytes from there greatly 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:38.550
 b lymphocytes and mature in this state bone marrow 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:42.990
 b Lymphocytes work to make bandages 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:47.760
 Meanwhile, t lymphocytes flow in the blood 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:50.910
 Sent to a strong battle between the thyroid and the heart 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:55.550
 The thymus consists of left and right dual-use 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:02:01.230
 It is between the thyroid and the heart 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:06.180
 Perform differentiation and maturation in the thymus of t cells 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:14.190
 80% of the lymphocytes in the blood 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:22.590
 t lymphocytes a and t-lymphocytes will lead the whole immune reaction 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:26.420
 Immature lymphocytes, which was born in the bone marrow A person who has passed the training course are educated in the thymus of a full-fledged 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.420
 I will be in a row 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.460
 Let's check out the next me 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.960
 Immunity 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.470
 Antigen-antibody reaction 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:43.330
 Macrophage 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:51.990
 Let 's search with search engines such as Yahoo! and Google 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:51.990
 In addition, let's look at books such as library medical encyclopedia or biological chemistry
