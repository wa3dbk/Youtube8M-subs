00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:05.230
 salam aleikoum hello dear friends 

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.779
 today I am going to speak to you about 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.160
 the probable evolution during and caumont 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:12.580
 Africa kill me 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.410
 profits from this evolution which is 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.620
 vanity but the evolution strongly too 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.780
 gathered over the next few years 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:22.240
 First we'll start there must 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:26.830
 that today present state 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.330
 things on october now 2014 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.540
 some central banks are starting to 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.489
 worry about being able to recover their gold 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.400
 physical that they entrusted to the states 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.660
 united and in particular germany the 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.180
 central bank of germany just like everything 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.070
 the world knows it is doubting 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.850
 a few days that she can one day 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.830
 recover these four sheep is when 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.870
 even something very important 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.809
 the central bank of venezuela has 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.900
 asked for the recovery of his den 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:58.330
 izik is of this name to the turnbuckles she 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.769
 was able to recover but this is the first 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.870
 once a central bank 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:04.089
 one asks and the recovery of his 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.010
 physical and other central banks 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.540
 are considering doing the 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.440
 same thing why because we think 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.390
 that there are more than 300 times in mci 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.979
 who blows in the world with respect to 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.670
 the actual physical gold 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:21.159
 so this information is comes a 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.990
 little bit confirmed what the 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.430
 Chinese for ten years the Chinese are 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:30.159
 accumulating physical gold and 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.090
 and then we dry up the market 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.530
 gold 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.420
 why because the Chinese buy 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.640
 Gold do monte delivery to China 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.350
 but make them you will not see 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.050
 never on the next 20 years and 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.060
 Chinese man sales why they 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.380
 are buying Chinese gold because 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:49.710
 they intend to 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.630
 to be able to launch the Chinese currency 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.130
 in the world thinks that if you want 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.649
 do business with china 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.030
 you will have to buy the currency 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.549
 Chinese instead of paying them in dollars 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.469
 or motorcycle and evo and they will say that 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.630
 in fact the Chinese currency is marked 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.630
 by the airlock a very 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.970
 powerful and which make anticipate and 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.400
 Africa could benefit from this 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.010
 is happening on the gold market or is 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.010
 develop without having to account to 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.170
 nobody because gold the money the 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.720
 deprives oil that binds in Africa 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.239
 more than enough for the 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.610
 African continent be one of the 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:30.630
 best continents of the planet 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.290
 for that we will have to reclaim 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.030
 this wealth 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.090
 instead of leaving multinationals 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.769
 come to pay concessions to 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.599
 fine arts with bits of bread and 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.370
 recover billions coming out of 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.890
 outside it's called everything 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.720
 just siphon a ticket if you 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.880
 have a partner the partner can not 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.660
 not come say it me I take 80% and 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.510
 you 20% 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.390
 it's not a partner this one it's 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.950
 a predator the partner the one who 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.859
 come see you who are you saying I you 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.530
 help to take your wealth and you me 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:02.970
 pay for learning that's why 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.350
 Islamic funds are interesting 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.090
 the Islamic fund 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.760
 he will lend you money for that 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.290
 you can develop your tool 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.160
 production whether it's the materials 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.900
 first 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:18.660
 wherever agricultural materials and 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.790
 then wanted to repay and you stay 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.720
 owner and the concession and 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.080
 the production tool 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.560
 this is called saucers and dubai and 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:31.910
 the most accomplished financial center 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:35.280
 to be able to structure these products there 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:39.090
 I would like to point out that banks 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:42.590
 African power plants at least 4 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.590
 inches have in their reserves 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.400
 while central banks 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.510
 Europeans have more than 50 inches yet 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.380
 in their bookings 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.930
 so the difference is abysmal so he 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:58.050
 is missing information 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:00.000
 this information she is there one 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.280
 is seriously considering redesigning 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.760
 international monetary system that does not 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.590
 can no longer be based on a currency 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:12.840
 unique a green ticket that we took my 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:14.040
 will is so sacred what his have 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.630
 not what he is doing 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.540
 in the world market there is a 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:23.840
 subjectivity that does not correspond to the 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:26.030
 sweat from the bottom of the tank so 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.670
 today I 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:32.240
 i still have to order to africa 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:35.050
 to be able to reclaim his weapon 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:38.090
 because the future of africa passes 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:41.150
 by the total cotton of these materials 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:45.230
 first or that link a tool that 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:48.260
 exists it is the sukuk in other words a 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:51.169
 good Islamic who is here to be able 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:54.160
 help the public sector and the sector 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:59.180
 private sector to develop 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:00.770
 without any debt since these defects 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.090
 arrives to help you 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.680
 refund 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:09.470
 with the profits and then you stay 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:13.100
 owner of vote in resources 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:17.510
 mining of your resources come here 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:20.390
 so I wanted to send this message to the 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:23.330
 African youth and I hope I can 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:26.000
 have spinoffs so that I can 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:29.950
 then explain more clearly more 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.950
 exactly how french
