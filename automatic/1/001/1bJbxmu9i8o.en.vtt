00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.229
 Is the student's behavior wrong 

00:00:10.229 --> 00:00:13.889
 educators how to deal with situations of indiscipline this year 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.369
 back in action today by mp's request is in all 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.180
 educational institutions in the country 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.220
 show the importance of country school integration for the social formation of the 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.710
 student 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.710
 that we have to think that who discipline 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.620
 and do not lack race indiscipline assault on student issue 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.270
 the problem of indiscipline has to be thought by the school then it is that never 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.170
 that the question that is in the air is closer 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.740
 how to berate the student 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.760
 I think the big problem of the school 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.870
 is to discuss why people are getting on and what the 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.450
 involved and engaged in this situation 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.550
 both procedural and law 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.860
 should establish a dialogue to try to understand what this 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.010
 student behavior 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.300
 if you must first receive the student 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.710
 chamel 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.760
 I talked to him 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.750
 out of the eyes of others 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.420
 depending on the u 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.810
 with a secure voice 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.810
 with a blunt drought without the others noticing 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.060
 sebastiÃ£o look 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.060
 no need to talk 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.810
 if you just talk 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.130
 'please' 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.050
 do not scream 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.410
 never lie down 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.540
 the best way to berate the student 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.340
 in the silence of coordination 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.340
 in the intimacy of coordination 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.230
 and out 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.230
 where the problem occurred 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.730
 I must be proposed to him 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.920
 Did you realize the mistake made? 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.860
 that this needs to be fixed 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.710
 that he will 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.690
 and he evidently needs and in relation to this error to correct himself this 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.690
 no more circuit and titus 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:17.859
 the biggest mistake 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:23.589
 when correcting a student when drawing attention also of an employee 

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:25.599
 inside the company 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.510
 call attention to him 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:29.710
 so cool 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.910
 for everyone to know 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.179
 so that the whole world hears that he is a kind of scapegoat 

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:40.379
 Know where you create you create a victim 

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:43.809
 everyone will stick with the theme of this person 

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:47.039
 They will not believe your speech. 

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:50.039
 in an error that he committed is capable of being even applauded 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:54.839
 and education 

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:58.739
 and part to the family so that parents and schools education and training 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:01.079
 as a citizen 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:02.050
 one for power 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.110
 is to put it next to society so I think the other there is a sample in the 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.949
 cult born responsibility 

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:11.949
 between parents and the school itself 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:14.279
 education 

00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:16.069
 it's very strong 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:21.609
 if she does not exist the child arrived so to speak the car monarchy in the room 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.739
 educated class by whom 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.269
 is a person with whom she most lived can be your grandmother can be 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:29.650
 housekeeper 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.699
 can be a television set 

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:35.879
 there are many families who unfortunately outsource education to the 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:39.029
 Television then complained there was nothing to complain about 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.079
 It's not the school that has to educate 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:47.290
 or the family that has to educate the two need to work together 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:51.389
 and when the child arrives at school 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:55.129
 with certain courses tunnels ways of being and acting 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:59.409
 that do not fit with a basic education of a human being 

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:05.929
 school has obligation the school has authority my duty 

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:09.809
 to Correct Child Poster Name 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.010
 imagine school children in six years 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:17.499
 your mental structure 

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:21.439
 can already know perfectly what is a sarcasm 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.259
 she watching 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:28.010
 I do not know how many thousand more works 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.259
 3 5 thousand per month 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:31.830
 television 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.150
 I did not know how many filmaches on the woodpecker. 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:39.050
 the woodpecker only does evil what she has learned 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.669
 to do evil 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:43.219
 the school needs to intervene 

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:46.379
 show the error and correct this year 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.180
 yea
