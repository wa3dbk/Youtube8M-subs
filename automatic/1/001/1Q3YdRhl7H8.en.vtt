need<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.189> though<00:01:35.400> but<00:01:35.850> you're<00:01:35.939> going<00:01:36.060> to

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
need to though but you're going to

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.880 
need to though but you're going to
complete<00:01:36.390> all<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.990> exercises<00:01:37.439> straight

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
complete all the exercises straight

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.740 
complete all the exercises straight
after<00:01:38.220> each<00:01:38.280> other<00:01:38.430> in<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.939> exact<00:01:39.329> order<00:01:39.600> I'm

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
after each other in the exact order I'm

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.690 
after each other in the exact order I'm
going<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.930> show<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.259> right<00:01:40.740> now<00:01:40.799> you're<00:01:41.549> going

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
going to show you right now you're going

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.030 
going to show you right now you're going
to<00:01:41.759> do<00:01:41.909> at<00:01:42.150> least<00:01:42.240> four<00:01:43.020> sets<00:01:43.320> of<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.649> complete

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
to do at least four sets of the complete

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.679 
to do at least four sets of the complete
routine<00:01:44.369> but<00:01:44.670> if<00:01:44.820> that's<00:01:45.000> too<00:01:45.119> easy<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.540> can

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
routine but if that's too easy you can

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.899 
routine but if that's too easy you can
either<00:01:45.840> update<00:01:46.320> dumbbells<00:01:47.040> increase<00:01:47.790> your

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
either update dumbbells increase your

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.999 
either update dumbbells increase your
intensity<00:01:48.360> or<00:01:48.689> just<00:01:49.110> do<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.259> few<00:01:49.500> more<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.890> the

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
intensity or just do a few more of the

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.789 
intensity or just do a few more of the
complete<00:01:50.430> circuit<00:01:50.729> it's<00:01:51.360> all<00:01:51.600> up<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.560> but

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
complete circuit it's all up to you but

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.590 
complete circuit it's all up to you but
it's<00:01:52.950> powerful<00:01:53.369> it's<00:01:53.700> effective<00:01:54.210> but<00:01:54.570> you

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
it's powerful it's effective but you

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.149 
it's powerful it's effective but you
need<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.079> make<00:01:55.170> sure<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.470> push<00:01:55.680> yourself<00:01:56.009> as

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
need to make sure you push yourself as

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.920 
need to make sure you push yourself as
well<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:56.729> let<00:01:57.149> me<00:01:57.240> quickly<00:01:57.360> take<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.750> through

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
well so let me quickly take you through

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.690 
well so let me quickly take you through
one<00:01:58.140> complete<00:01:58.649> circuit<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.219> make<00:01:59.369> sure<00:01:59.549> you

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
one complete circuit and make sure you

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.490 
one complete circuit and make sure you
follow<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:00.090> just<00:02:00.420> as<00:02:00.570> I'm<00:02:00.930> going<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.140> do<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.380> in

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
follow it just as I'm going to do it in

00:02:01.500 --> 00:03:32.990 
follow it just as I'm going to do it in
this<00:02:01.619> video<00:02:01.799> right<00:02:02.159> now

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:57.950 

Oh

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:57.960

so<00:03:58.960> there<00:03:59.320> you<00:03:59.380> go<00:03:59.530> guys<00:03:59.710> as<00:03:59.950> you<00:04:00.190> can<00:04:00.370> see<00:04:00.550> very

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
so there you go guys as you can see very

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.970 
so there you go guys as you can see very
intense<00:04:01.510> you<00:04:01.900> know<00:04:01.930> most<00:04:02.290> of<00:04:02.380> these<00:04:02.530> exercise

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
intense you know most of these exercise

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.410 
intense you know most of these exercise
as<00:04:03.160> well<00:04:03.190> but<00:04:03.520> maybe<00:04:03.700> you've<00:04:03.970> never<00:04:04.150> done<00:04:04.360> a

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
as well but maybe you've never done a

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.210 
as well but maybe you've never done a
complex<00:04:04.870> and<00:04:05.110> if<00:04:05.230> you<00:04:05.350> do<00:04:05.560> you'll<00:04:05.770> soon<00:04:06.010> find

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
complex and if you do you'll soon find

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.190 
complex and if you do you'll soon find
out<00:04:06.430> it's<00:04:06.880> pretty<00:04:07.210> intense<00:04:07.660> and<00:04:07.810> very

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
out it's pretty intense and very

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.900 
out it's pretty intense and very
effective<00:04:08.710> so<00:04:08.830> I<00:04:08.890> know<00:04:08.950> it's<00:04:09.520> going<00:04:09.670> to<00:04:09.730> help
