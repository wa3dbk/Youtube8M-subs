him Griffin elevator obviously made by

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.990 
him Griffin elevator obviously made by
Griffin<00:00:35.790> what<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.420> does<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.809> raises<00:00:37.230> your

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
Griffin what it does it raises your

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.319 
Griffin what it does it raises your
laptop<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.239> think<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.660> believe<00:00:39.899> 5.5<00:00:40.530> inches<00:00:40.860> up

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
laptop I think I believe 5.5 inches up

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.700 
laptop I think I believe 5.5 inches up
allowing<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.660> have<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:43.230> know<00:00:43.320> make<00:00:43.590> it

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
allowing you to have you know make it

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.319 
allowing you to have you know make it
easier<00:00:43.980> for<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.280> view<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:44.760> it's

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
easier for you to view it and it's

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.119 
easier for you to view it and it's
actually<00:00:45.450> really<00:00:45.840> useful<00:00:45.960> when<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.770> want<00:00:46.800> to

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
actually really useful when you want to

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.920 
actually really useful when you want to
use<00:00:47.340> your<00:00:47.489> laptop<00:00:47.640> like<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.969> desktop<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.809> get

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
use your laptop like a desktop and get

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.540 
use your laptop like a desktop and get
an<00:00:49.020> external<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.950> know<00:00:50.010> mouse<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.430> keyboard

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
an external you know mouse and keyboard

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.119 
an external you know mouse and keyboard
which<00:00:51.030> I'm<00:00:51.180> doing<00:00:51.300> right<00:00:51.420> now<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:52.469> raising<00:00:52.949> it

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
which I'm doing right now so raising it

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.920 
which I'm doing right now so raising it
up<00:00:53.219> will<00:00:53.460> probably<00:00:53.879> prevent<00:00:54.149> next<00:00:54.570> raid<00:00:54.719> and

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
up will probably prevent next raid and

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.650 
up will probably prevent next raid and
look<00:00:55.020> good<00:00:55.170> stuff<00:00:55.610> and<00:00:56.610> uh<00:00:56.850> yeah<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.480> have

drawer<00:02:29.970> computer<00:02:30.599> is<00:02:30.750> gonna<00:02:30.959> you<00:02:31.140> know<00:02:31.230> be

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
drawer computer is gonna you know be

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.870 
drawer computer is gonna you know be
touching<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:31.980> stand<00:02:32.280> so<00:02:32.459> there's<00:02:32.610> a<00:02:32.700> lot<00:02:32.849> of

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
touching the stand so there's a lot of

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.750 
touching the stand so there's a lot of
friction<00:02:33.410> hopefully<00:02:34.410> not<00:02:34.560> lost<00:02:34.799> slipping<00:02:35.310> um

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
friction hopefully not lost slipping um

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.539 
friction hopefully not lost slipping um
it<00:02:36.660> doesn't<00:02:36.840> seem<00:02:37.140> a<00:02:37.260> lil<00:02:37.530> flip<00:02:37.769> a<00:02:37.860> lot<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.220> so

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
it doesn't seem a lil flip a lot and so

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.910 
it doesn't seem a lil flip a lot and so
we<00:02:38.610> have<00:02:38.700> this<00:02:38.790> very<00:02:39.090> sturdy<00:02:39.769> aluminum<00:02:40.769> it's

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
we have this very sturdy aluminum it's

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.509 
we have this very sturdy aluminum it's
very<00:02:41.130> solid<00:02:42.049> well<00:02:43.049> weighted<00:02:43.440> in<00:02:43.890> this<00:02:44.250> plastic

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
very solid well weighted in this plastic

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.089 
very solid well weighted in this plastic
holding<00:02:44.940> together<00:02:45.319> it's<00:02:46.319> not<00:02:46.440> Fleming<00:02:46.829> at<00:02:46.950> all

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
holding together it's not Fleming at all

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.390 
holding together it's not Fleming at all
it's<00:02:47.400> like<00:02:47.670> very<00:02:48.000> tough<00:02:49.069> trying<00:02:50.069> to<00:02:50.130> think

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
it's like very tough trying to think

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.370 
it's like very tough trying to think
what<00:02:50.730> would<00:02:50.970> this<00:02:51.239> plastic<00:02:51.810> be<00:02:52.049> made<00:02:52.079> out<00:02:52.230> of

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
what would this plastic be made out of

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.170 
what would this plastic be made out of
any<00:02:53.250> other<00:02:53.340> things<00:02:53.609> are<00:02:53.730> made<00:02:53.819> of<00:02:53.940> this<00:02:54.030> kind

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
any other things are made of this kind

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.789 
any other things are made of this kind
of<00:02:54.269> plastic<00:02:54.690> but<00:02:54.840> let<00:02:54.959> me<00:02:54.989> think<00:02:55.200> about<00:02:55.350> it<00:02:55.530> um

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
of plastic but let me think about it um

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.699 
of plastic but let me think about it um
I<00:02:56.430> don't<00:02:57.389> know<00:02:57.510> it's<00:02:57.810> even<00:02:58.109> hear<00:02:58.290> it<00:02:58.440> slap

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
I don't know it's even hear it slap

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.379 
I don't know it's even hear it slap
against<00:02:58.950> my<00:02:59.069> hand<00:02:59.190> it's<00:02:59.370> really<00:02:59.670> solid<00:02:59.880> so<00:03:00.209> I'm

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:00.389 
against my hand it's really solid so I'm

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:02.770 
against my hand it's really solid so I'm
not<00:03:00.510> very<00:03:00.750> worried<00:03:01.109> about<00:03:01.200> putting<00:03:01.500> this

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
not very worried about putting this

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.270 
not very worried about putting this
underneath<00:03:03.780> my<00:03:03.959> macbook<00:03:04.350> so<00:03:04.680> all<00:03:04.920> you<00:03:04.950> just

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
underneath my macbook so all you just

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:12.500 
underneath my macbook so all you just
slide<00:03:05.579> this<00:03:05.730> in<00:03:06.049> very<00:03:07.049> simple<00:03:11.180> there<00:03:12.180> you<00:03:12.299> have

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
slide this in very simple there you have

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.430 
slide this in very simple there you have
it<00:03:12.950> like<00:03:13.950> so<00:03:14.280> looks<00:03:14.609> like<00:03:14.730> this<00:03:15.079> the<00:03:16.079> feet<00:03:16.260> on

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
it like so looks like this the feet on

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.640 
it like so looks like this the feet on
the<00:03:16.590> bottom<00:03:16.880> there's<00:03:17.880> four<00:03:18.299> feet<00:03:18.690> two<00:03:19.230> long

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
the bottom there's four feet two long

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:20.720 
the bottom there's four feet two long
ones<00:03:19.859> and<00:03:20.100> they'll<00:03:20.190> actually<00:03:20.370> a<00:03:20.549> little

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
ones and they'll actually a little

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.190 
ones and they'll actually a little
taller<00:03:20.970> so<00:03:21.389> it<00:03:21.540> gives<00:03:21.630> you<00:03:21.780> that<00:03:21.900> kind<00:03:22.109> of

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
taller so it gives you that kind of

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.229 
taller so it gives you that kind of
raised<00:03:22.470> elevation<00:03:23.100> you<00:03:23.700> would<00:03:23.819> want<00:03:24.060> when

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
raised elevation you would want when

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.009 
raised elevation you would want when
you're<00:03:24.329> surfing<00:03:24.600> on<00:03:24.989> all<00:03:25.200> computer<00:03:27.019> really

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
nice so previously my macbook did have a

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.420 
nice so previously my macbook did have a
sin<00:03:30.840> to<00:03:30.870> rest<00:03:31.200> on<00:03:31.350> pond<00:03:31.530> but<00:03:31.829> as<00:03:32.040> you<00:03:32.310> can<00:03:32.370> tell

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
sin to rest on pond but as you can tell

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.160 
sin to rest on pond but as you can tell
it's<00:03:32.849> very<00:03:33.209> low<00:03:33.359> to<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.540> ground<00:03:33.599> it<00:03:33.959> only

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
it's very low to the ground it only

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.839 
it's very low to the ground it only
helped<00:03:34.530> for<00:03:34.680> ventilation<00:03:35.040> it<00:03:35.579> didn't<00:03:35.760> help

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
helped for ventilation it didn't help

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.309 
helped for ventilation it didn't help
you<00:03:36.060> when<00:03:36.269> you're<00:03:36.450> actually<00:03:36.720> surfing<00:03:37.200> on<00:03:37.290> the

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
you when you're actually surfing on the

you when you're actually surfing on the
computer<00:03:37.680> very<00:03:38.310> low<00:03:38.549> it's<00:03:38.940> almost<00:03:39.269> the<00:03:39.450> same

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
computer very low it's almost the same

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.660 
computer very low it's almost the same
height<00:03:39.750> you<00:03:39.959> would<00:03:40.079> put<00:03:40.260> your<00:03:40.380> laptop<00:03:40.650> on<00:03:41.040> so

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
height you would put your laptop on so

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.330 
height you would put your laptop on so
me<00:03:41.849> to<00:03:41.970> pop<00:03:42.299> off<00:03:42.989> and<00:03:43.620> it's<00:03:43.859> just<00:03:43.920> as<00:03:44.130> very

me to pop off and it's just as very
basic<00:03:45.620> very<00:03:46.620> basic<00:03:47.040> but<00:03:47.489> just<00:03:47.790> this<00:03:47.880> plastic<00:03:48.630> X

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
basic very basic but just this plastic X

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.259 
basic very basic but just this plastic X
I<00:03:49.410> guessing<00:03:49.769> and<00:03:49.889> pulled<00:03:50.190> together<00:03:50.310> so<00:03:51.150> it's

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
I guessing and pulled together so it's

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:52.759 
I guessing and pulled together so it's
really<00:03:51.359> great<00:03:51.540> for<00:03:51.599> travel<00:03:52.079> but<00:03:52.290> I<00:03:52.470> wanted

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
really great for travel but I wanted

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.099 
really great for travel but I wanted
something<00:03:53.280> a<00:03:53.489> little<00:03:53.700> higher<00:03:53.910> so<00:03:54.720> I<00:03:54.780> can<00:03:54.959> look

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
something a little higher so I can look

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:56.449 
something a little higher so I can look
at<00:03:55.230> my<00:03:55.380> macbook<00:03:55.739> easier<00:03:56.040> when<00:03:56.220> I'm<00:03:56.280> dual

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.160 
risk your macbook right on top like this
and<00:04:27.920> you<00:04:28.850> can<00:04:28.970> see<00:04:29.090> how<00:04:29.120> tall<00:04:29.540> it<00:04:29.690> is<00:04:29.750> from<00:04:30.020> up

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
and you can see how tall it is from up

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.950 
and you can see how tall it is from up
from<00:04:30.530> the<00:04:30.760> bottom<00:04:31.760> of<00:04:31.970> the<00:04:32.030> desk<00:04:32.240> Larry<00:04:32.720> shape

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
height the height of one MX revolution I

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.660 
height the height of one MX revolution I
guess<00:04:36.410> I<00:04:36.440> can<00:04:36.560> say<00:04:36.770> you<00:04:37.460> open<00:04:37.700> it<00:04:37.760> up<00:04:39.670> it's

actually<00:04:40.940> on<00:04:41.060> a<00:04:41.090> tilt<00:04:41.570> I'm<00:04:41.990> sure<00:04:42.380> it<00:04:43.130> actually

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
actually on a tilt I'm sure it actually

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.460 
actually on a tilt I'm sure it actually
on<00:04:43.520> a<00:04:43.550> tilt<00:04:44.030> because<00:04:44.330> it's<00:04:45.170> easier<00:04:45.440> for

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
on a tilt because it's easier for

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.130 
on a tilt because it's easier for
surfing<00:04:46.180> and<00:04:47.180> there's<00:04:47.390> all<00:04:47.510> a<00:04:47.540> lot<00:04:47.900> of<00:04:48.020> room
