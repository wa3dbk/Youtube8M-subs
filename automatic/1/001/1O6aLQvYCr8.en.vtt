00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.280
Hi folks, this is Rahul from MySmartPrice
and it’s time for a detailed review of Xiaomi’s

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.809
Mi 4i - the Chinese firm’s latest mid-range
offering.

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.360
The MI4i claimed to be the first true global
smart phone from Xiaomi, and is priced

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.910
at an attractive price tag of ₹12,999 - with
a compelling feature-list on &nbsp;paper.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.160
Does the Mi 4i have what it takes to solidify Xiaomi’s
foothold in India? Let’s find out.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.040
The Mi 4i - like most other Xiaomi devices
has great build quality - which is at the

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.359
same level as that of the Samsungs, LGs and
HTCs of the world. At the front of the

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:44.609
Mi 4i is the large 5-inch, full HD display. The
back of the Mi 4i has a matte finish that

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:49.489
gives better in-hand feel. Currently the white
&amp; grey colour versions are available for sale

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.170
in India. The back is non-removable, so if
you were looking to get a different back shell

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.710
to customise the look of the Mi 4i, you're
out of luck. The left side of the Mi 4i is

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.300
where the buttons are located, with the volume
rockers sitting above the power button. The

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.420
3.5mm audio jack is located at the top, whereas
a microUSB charging port sits at the bottom.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.430
The Mi 4i features a 5-inch full-HD display
which also gets a glass-laminated One Glass

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:22.049
Solution by the Corning. The full HD display
on the Mi 4i is an IPS panel with a 441ppi

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.990
pixel density. The LCD screen is not as contrast-rich
as that of an AMOLED display, but has vivid

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.159
colours and good amount of brightness. A new
feature introduced with the Mi 4i is the Sunlight

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.180
Display, which automatically increases or
decreases the brightness of the screen when

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.450
outdoors - to enhance readability.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.840
The device features 2GB RAM, 16GB of non expandable
storage, there is a 13MP camera at the back along with

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:59.000
5MP camera at the front. Moving onto the processor, Qualcomm Snapdragon 615
SoC with eight Cortex A53 cores takes cares of the processing.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.130
The phone has dual band Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.1 and
dual-SIM connectivity.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:11.340
The battery is rated at 3,120mAh and in non removable. A noticeable
omission is a microSD card slot, which is

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.130
the only major drawback in an otherwise well-rounded
feature set. The phone has a thickness of

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.150
7.8mm and an overall weight of just 130g.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.710
The MI4i has a clean audio output but suffers
from below average sound output to our test

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:30.900
earphones which included Apple EarPods and
Creative Aurvana 2. Xiaomi claimed a lot about

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.180
its audiophile grade audio output to the headphones
but the real world performance was underwhelming.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.780
The rear speaker of the MI4i has one of the
weakest outputs we have experienced so far

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.190
in this price range. There are chances that
you may even miss calls due to the subpar

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.140
ringer volume.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.180
Xiaomi Mi 4i doesn't features a separate video
app, but you can use File Explorer or Gallery

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.500
app to find all of your videos.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.740
The video player interface is very basic but
there is rich video codec support. It managed

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:03.540
to play everything we threw at it including
MKV and WMV files. The AC3 audio codec is

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.110
supported too.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:11.630
Thanks to the Adreno 405 GPU, the MI4i can
play graphics intensive games like Real Racing

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.870
3 without any major frame drops. But if you
are playing for a longer duration, the phone

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.400
heats up considerably.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.560
The phone managed an Antutu score of 39,431
which is better than MI3 but lower than the

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.060
MI4.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.560
The Mi 4i comes with the excellent Sony IMX214
imaging sensor at the back for the main camera

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.280
- which is a module used in several high-end
phones, including last year’s LG G3. But

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.560
the end result isn’t outstanding in daylight
photography. The Mi4I camera suffered heavily

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.290
with inaccurate white balance in our many
day light shots. Our expectations were much

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.040
higher and we were disappointed by the real
world camera performance. The front camera

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.500
has 5MP resolution that can take good selfies
in brightly-lit conditions. Here are some samples...

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.740

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.860
The camera UI has a variety of settings that
allow you to tweak your images, and there

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.090
are two HDR modes available: Normal and Live.

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.830
Full-HD video performance is also decent.
MI4i lacks the Electronic image stabilisation

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:31.090
too and many times we got shaky videos in
handheld video shoots. Here are some video samples.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.680
MI4i has many software-based filters and modes
that allows you to edit your photos through

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.340
a series of filters and other enhancements.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.409
When it comes to the battery life, Xiaomi
claims that the Mi 4i can go two days on a

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:01.909
full charge. But, we observed that our device
lasted a day and a half with normal usage.

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:04.800
In heavy usage scenarios, the phone will just
last a day.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.520
The Mi 4i runs MIUI 6 atop an Android 5.0.2
Lollipop core out of the box. &nbsp;We observed

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.129
frequent stutters in the UI while using the
phone while performing day to day tasks. This

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:16.919
in spite of the fact that we were on the &nbsp;latest
stable ROM released by Xiaomi. We also noticed

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:21.259
that the phone takes an abnormally long time
to perform google play Store app updates

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:26.499
MIUI offers lots of options to users looking
to customise every facet of the UI. There’s

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:31.389
a theming engine that allows you to change
the font, backgrounds, icons and overall looks

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:32.389
of the MIUI.

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:36.449
Call quality is decent but it is definitely
not as good as the MI4.

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:42.129
We generally had a good experience till now
with the MIUI 6 on various devices including

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:48.499
MI4, MI3, Redmi Note 4G but the experience
was laggy on MI4i.

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:54.159
The Mi 4i has lots of points in its favour
on paper but in real world the device excels

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:58.879
only in display and battery performance. You
will also be let down by the software as it

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:04.759
feels unpolished on Android Lollipop. Also,
the limited 16GB of storage without a microSD

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:09.669
slot is simply too low in today's age and
time. Overall we were disappointed by the

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:15.779
complete experience of the Mi4i and believe
it could have been a much better device. Besides

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:20.259
you can get the Mi4 - a much better phone,
for slightly more money.
