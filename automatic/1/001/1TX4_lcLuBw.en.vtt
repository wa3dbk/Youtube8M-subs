kill<00:01:03.420> streaks<00:01:03.719> are<00:01:04.170> pretty<00:01:04.379> good<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:04.710> map

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
kill streaks are pretty good in this map

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.410 
kill streaks are pretty good in this map
just<00:01:04.920> because<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.519> how<00:01:05.610> open<00:01:05.790> East<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.299> not

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
just because of how open East is not

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.270 
just because of how open East is not
many<00:01:06.600> places<00:01:06.869> where<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.439> can<00:01:07.860> hide<00:01:08.040> from<00:01:08.070> a

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
many places where you can hide from a

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.280 
many places where you can hide from a
kill<00:01:08.460> streak<00:01:08.549> but<00:01:08.970> I<00:01:09.030> don't<00:01:09.299> think<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.750> think

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
kill streak but I don't think I think

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.600 
kill streak but I don't think I think
I'll<00:01:10.380> get<00:01:10.439> like<00:01:10.590> one<00:01:10.830> kill<00:01:11.040> with<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.400> game

a you know when you do stuff like that

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.260 
a you know when you do stuff like that
it<00:02:02.159> just<00:02:02.340> takes<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.579> little<00:02:02.640> bit<00:02:02.790> longer<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.149> do

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
it just takes a little bit longer to do

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.480 
it just takes a little bit longer to do
it<00:02:03.390> but<00:02:03.630> if<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.140> know<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.619> unlock<00:02:05.130> tokens

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
it but if you know the unlock tokens

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.499 
it but if you know the unlock tokens
that<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.640> get<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.000> start<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.360> game

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
that you get to the start of the game

aren't<00:02:06.780> enough<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.259> buy<00:02:07.409> everything<00:02:07.740> in<00:02:07.920> the

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
game so I thought you know it's an

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.230 
game so I thought you know it's an
opportune<00:02:10.200> time<00:02:10.229> and

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
opportune time and

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.900 
strike one I've got millions of them
I've<00:03:29.600> got<00:03:29.630> those<00:03:29.930> in<00:03:29.960> abundance<00:03:30.560> I<00:03:30.860> just<00:03:31.610> I

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
I've got those in abundance I just I

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.970 
I've got those in abundance I just I
always<00:03:32.210> mess<00:03:32.480> up<00:03:32.630> before<00:03:32.900> I<00:03:32.930> go<00:03:33.080> nuclear<00:03:33.260> so<00:03:33.740> I

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
always mess up before I go nuclear so I

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.800 
always mess up before I go nuclear so I
would<00:03:34.550> have<00:03:34.610> said<00:03:34.790> that<00:03:34.940> game<00:03:35.090> playing<00:03:35.360> but<00:03:35.570> I

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
would have said that game playing but I

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.210 
would have said that game playing but I
wasn't<00:03:36.050> recording<00:03:36.230> what<00:03:36.740> I<00:03:36.770> was<00:03:36.950> recording

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
wasn't recording what I was recording

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.280 
wasn't recording what I was recording
but<00:03:37.940> I<00:03:37.970> deleted<00:03:38.270> the<00:03:38.450> file<00:03:38.660> and<00:03:38.900> it<00:03:39.020> was<00:03:39.110> too

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
but I deleted the file and it was too

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.900 
but I deleted the file and it was too
large<00:03:39.440> for<00:03:39.560> my<00:03:39.770> recycling<00:03:40.280> bin<00:03:40.340> because<00:03:40.640> I

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
large for my recycling bin because I

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.030 
large for my recycling bin because I
used<00:03:41.120> a<00:03:41.240> black<00:03:41.420> magic<00:03:41.750> which<00:03:41.960> records<00:03:42.440> from

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
used a black magic which records from

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.130 
used a black magic which records from

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
HDMI tend to have huge file sizes so I

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.990 
HDMI tend to have huge file sizes so I
deleted<00:03:48.470> it<00:03:48.800> it<00:03:48.950> was<00:03:49.040> too<00:03:49.190> big<00:03:49.340> to<00:03:49.370> supplement

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
deleted it it was too big to supplement

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000 
deleted it it was too big to supplement
