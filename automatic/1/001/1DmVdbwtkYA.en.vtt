00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
our mind ready to beat them I think I I

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.780 
our mind ready to beat them I think I I
think<00:01:15.659> it's<00:01:15.780> always<00:01:15.930> been<00:01:16.229> true<00:01:16.520> we're<00:01:17.520> never

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
think it's always been true we're never

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.030 
think it's always been true we're never
really<00:01:18.000> supposed<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.390> wear<00:01:18.600> red<00:01:18.869> in<00:01:19.080> in<00:01:19.650> doubt

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
really supposed to wear red in in doubt

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.960 
really supposed to wear red in in doubt
ward<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:21.170> so<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.200> think<00:01:22.680> that<00:01:22.920> he<00:01:23.220> he<00:01:23.610> may<00:01:23.820> have

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
ward and so I think that he he may have

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.490 
ward and so I think that he he may have
stepped<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.390> up<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.600> little<00:01:24.750> bit<00:01:24.869> being<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.350> he

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
stepped it up a little bit being that he

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.399 
stepped it up a little bit being that he
went<00:01:25.740> went<00:01:26.189> here<00:01:26.430> he<00:01:26.640> played<00:01:26.909> here<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:28.140> I

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
went went here he played here and so I

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.520 
went went here he played here and so I
mean<00:01:28.590> but<00:01:28.799> it's<00:01:29.310> definitely<00:01:29.549> been<00:01:30.530> evident

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
mean but it's definitely been evident

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.490 
mean but it's definitely been evident
that<00:01:31.650> we<00:01:31.710> we<00:01:32.520> have<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.970> be<00:01:33.090> Nebraska

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.820 

I<00:01:39.360> mean<00:01:40.360> I<00:01:40.630> think<00:01:40.990> everybody<00:01:41.500> has<00:01:41.620> to<00:01:41.650> play

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830
