heads gonna come down as well what
that's<00:01:45.739> to<00:01:45.920> do<00:01:46.069> something<00:01:46.489> we<00:01:46.580> talked<00:01:46.789> about

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:46.879 
that's to do something we talked about

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:48.850 
that's to do something we talked about
earlier<00:01:47.390> with<00:01:47.599> getting<00:01:47.810> your<00:01:47.899> hips<00:01:48.170> up<00:01:48.379> if<00:01:48.709> her

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
head is down it's gonna be a lot easier

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:51.940 
head is down it's gonna be a lot easier
for<00:01:50.420> him<00:01:50.690> to<00:01:50.750> get<00:01:51.020> up<00:01:51.080> and<00:01:51.470> she<00:01:51.679> won't<00:01:51.830> be

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
for him to get up and she won't be

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.350 
for him to get up and she won't be
dragging<00:01:52.399> for<00:01:52.550> lower<00:01:52.729> half<00:01:53.030> through<00:01:53.270> the

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
dragging for lower half through the

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.300 
dragging for lower half through the
water<00:01:53.599> if<00:01:53.869> she<00:01:54.050> goes<00:01:54.140> breaststroke<00:01:54.709> so<00:01:55.160> it's

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
water if she goes breaststroke so it's

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.100 
water if she goes breaststroke so it's
periods<00:01:55.700> of<00:01:55.819> moving<00:01:56.179> and<00:01:56.300> periods<00:01:56.660> of<00:01:56.660> waiting

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
periods of moving and periods of waiting

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.779 
periods of moving and periods of waiting
she's<00:01:57.530> gonna<00:01:57.619> move<00:01:57.830> with<00:01:58.039> their<00:01:58.160> arms<00:01:58.459> to<00:01:58.580> get

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
she's gonna move with their arms to get

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:00.999 
she's gonna move with their arms to get
some<00:01:59.209> momentum<00:01:59.330> coming<00:01:59.869> forward<00:02:00.349> and<00:02:00.470> as<00:02:00.830> she

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
some momentum coming forward and as she

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.219 
some momentum coming forward and as she
comes<00:02:01.250> through<00:02:01.399> so<00:02:02.209> I'll<00:02:02.330> be<00:02:02.479> moving<00:02:02.720> herself

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
comes through so I'll be moving herself

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:04.300 
comes through so I'll be moving herself
forward<00:02:03.440> with<00:02:03.590> their<00:02:03.649> arms<00:02:03.800> anymore<00:02:04.099> so

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
forward with their arms anymore so

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.130 
forward with their arms anymore so
that's<00:02:04.429> when<00:02:04.610> the<00:02:04.700> legs<00:02:04.910> take<00:02:05.179> over<00:02:05.539> she'll

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
that's when the legs take over she'll

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.919 
that's when the legs take over she'll
pull<00:02:06.379> take<00:02:06.890> a<00:02:06.920> breath<00:02:07.190> come<00:02:07.759> through<00:02:08.060> and<00:02:08.239> kick

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
pull take a breath come through and kick

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.930 
pull take a breath come through and kick
to<00:02:09.140> finish<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.560> stroke<00:02:09.860> out<00:02:10.069> hopefully<00:02:10.819> in

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
to finish the stroke out hopefully in

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.820 
to finish the stroke out hopefully in
this<00:02:11.120> streamline<00:02:11.569> position<00:02:11.750> be

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
this streamline position be

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.950 
this streamline position be
tuck<00:02:13.370> frozen<00:02:13.640> meals<00:02:13.850> together<00:02:14.060> head<00:02:14.780> between

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
tuck frozen meals together head between
