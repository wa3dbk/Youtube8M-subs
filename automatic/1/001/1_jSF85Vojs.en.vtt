Antonio and it's not much of a flight so
I<00:00:52.110> really<00:00:52.320> don't<00:00:52.469> have<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.649> worry<00:00:52.860> about<00:00:52.980> a

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
I really don't have to worry about a

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.920 
I really don't have to worry about a
swelling<00:00:53.760> too<00:00:53.969> much<00:00:54.149> with<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.360> short<00:00:54.660> flight

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
swelling too much with that short flight

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.709 
swelling too much with that short flight
from<00:00:55.140> Dallas<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.620> San<00:00:55.800> Antonio<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:56.760> his<00:00:57.059> really

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
from Dallas to San Antonio so his really

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.389 
from Dallas to San Antonio so his really
Tony<00:00:58.079> Parker<00:00:58.410> could<00:00:58.590> turn<00:00:58.949> around<00:00:58.980> his<00:00:59.250> game

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
Tony Parker could turn around his game

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.150 
Tony Parker could turn around his game
for<00:00:59.640> Game<00:01:00.120> four<00:01:00.149> performance<00:01:00.989> if<00:01:01.649> indeed<00:01:01.980> he's

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
for Game four performance if indeed he's

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.700 
for Game four performance if indeed he's
a<00:01:02.190> little<00:01:02.460> bit<00:01:02.579> healthier<00:01:02.760> heading<00:01:03.270> into<00:01:03.710> into

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
a little bit healthier heading into into

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.620 
a little bit healthier heading into into
tonight<00:01:05.010> but<00:01:05.220> either<00:01:05.400> way<00:01:05.670> Wednesday<00:01:06.420> night<00:01:06.450> I

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
tonight but either way Wednesday night I

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.630 
tonight but either way Wednesday night I
think<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.049> best<00:01:07.260> play<00:01:07.619> for<00:01:07.860> this<00:01:07.950> game<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.430> the

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
think the best play for this game is the

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.399 
think the best play for this game is the
total<00:01:08.970> instead<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.630> spread<00:01:09.960> here<00:01:10.110> six

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
total instead of the spread here six

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.109 
total instead of the spread here six
points<00:01:10.740> with<00:01:10.830> Tony<00:01:11.070> Parker<00:01:11.280> injury<00:01:11.790> looming

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
points with Tony Parker injury looming

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.899 
points with Tony Parker injury looming
not<00:01:12.270> much<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.750> value<00:01:13.080> i<00:01:13.110> think<00:01:13.409> but<00:01:13.560> however

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
not much of a value i think but however

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.999 
not much of a value i think but however
198<00:01:14.909> points<00:01:15.150> is<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:16.049> lowest<00:01:16.470> total<00:01:16.890> that

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
198 points is the lowest total that

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.740 
198 points is the lowest total that
we've<00:01:17.159> seen<00:01:17.400> so<00:01:17.640> far<00:01:17.670> with<00:01:18.090> this<00:01:18.210> series<00:01:18.600> and

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
we've seen so far with this series and

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.450 
we've seen so far with this series and
even<00:01:19.350> though<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.530> seems<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.920> little<00:01:20.100> bit<00:01:20.280> odd

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
even though it seems a little bit odd

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.190 
even though it seems a little bit odd
that<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.759> books<00:01:20.970> might<00:01:21.180> be<00:01:21.270> baiting<00:01:21.630> us<00:01:21.750> to

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
that the books might be baiting us to

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.810 
that the books might be baiting us to
bet<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.470> over<00:01:22.650> i<00:01:22.799> think<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.340> could<00:01:23.369> still

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
bet the over i think that it could still

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.420 
bet the over i think that it could still
cash<00:01:24.150> here<00:01:24.509> between<00:01:25.140> these<00:01:25.530> two<00:01:25.799> teams<00:01:26.040> total

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
cash here between these two teams total

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.249 
cash here between these two teams total
is<00:01:26.700> like<00:01:27.060> i<00:01:27.150> said<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.450> lowest<00:01:27.600> it's<00:01:27.900> been<00:01:27.960> and

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
is like i said the lowest it's been and

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.990 
is like i said the lowest it's been and
is<00:01:28.619> now<00:01:28.799> cashed<00:01:29.070> in<00:01:29.280> two<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.700> last<00:01:29.850> three

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
is now cashed in two of the last three

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
think between these two teams both not

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.920 
think between these two teams both not
very<00:01:35.610> known<00:01:35.820> for<00:01:36.030> their<00:01:36.119> defense<00:01:36.509> at<00:01:36.689> times

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
very known for their defense at times

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.690 
very known for their defense at times
they<00:01:37.170> can<00:01:37.409> play<00:01:37.590> pretty<00:01:37.799> good<00:01:37.979> defense<00:01:38.130> but<00:01:38.490> at

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
they can play pretty good defense but at

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.700 
they can play pretty good defense but at

total diss lobe in San Antonio I think
the<00:01:57.659> Spurs<00:01:57.869> offense<00:01:58.140> will<00:01:58.469> likely<00:01:58.710> improve

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.210
