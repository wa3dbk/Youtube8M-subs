00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:08.980
 hey i am dominik of test.de 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:11.570
 here a short video is waiting for 62 35 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.049
 a higher priced sandwich maker in 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.049
 stainless steel look 

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.360
 This club sandwich maker looks thank you 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.750
 of his stainless steel case very much 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.210
 high quality and robust from positive falls 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.740
 the three-tier closure on so can 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.670
 even thicker sandwich easily 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.650
 getting tested 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.330
 the closure often one 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.230
 weak spot makes a very stable 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.120
 impression 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.580
 The metal plates are as usual 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.190
 are non-stick coated highlight 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:41.040
 these two statements here in front and 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.000
 behind the possibly expiring cheese 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.829
 to catch 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.160
 but it does not hit so much cheese 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.410
 because that belongs 62 35 does not try 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.370
 to separate the sandwich chain like many 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.680
 other devices 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.600
 because often it is like this 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.280
 Separation he ensures that the filling 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.780
 is squeezed out of the strings 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.120
 not to this device 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.910
 the only criticism is the form of the 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.200
 metal plates as you can see here 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.299
 Is not she great on big sandwich 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.840
 we designed the top and the slice 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.610
 below 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.820
 but space and on the sides of the enough 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.820
 not place 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.479
 I have 26 for demonstration 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.430
 prepared once with normal 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.530
 toast and once with sandwich 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.530
 toast slices is sandwiched 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:35.790
 salami mushrooms cheese mayonnaise and 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:38.430
 ketchup in small on a sandwich 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.520
 fits in pretty well when you look at yourself 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:47.369
 top down place and the big sandwich 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:59.729
 as already mentioned fits just like that 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:02:01.229
 far the indicator light up here 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.270
 signals that the sandwiches are ready 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.610
 are anyone able to recognize a page 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:12.959
 the big beast asks something from the 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:14.390
 sandwich maker out so the planning 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.440
 looks good 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.319
 Of course, the program will not be like this 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.790
 optimally sealed at the places where 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.790
 there was too much room in the sandwich maker 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:35.959
 but you can tell that the cheese 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.959
 melted inside is very hot 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.130
 he clarifies 2 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.170
 35 is a sandwich maker from the 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.819
 upscale price segment with his 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.900
 Stainless steel housing made one 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.480
 high quality impression 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.800
 positively striking that he is the cent 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.360
 not trying to separate more middle 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.030
 so that the coating is not one side 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.489
 squeezed out is the negative form 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.110
 the metal plates cleaning the 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.700
 sandwich maker it is relatively easy 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.489
 because the cheese is in these 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.080
 Dents caught here 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.090
 the detailed test report included 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.069
 Pictures of this sandwich maker or too 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.450
