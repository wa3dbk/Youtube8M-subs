00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
I think that the most important part is

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.149 
I think that the most important part is
that<00:03:23.049> you<00:03:23.140> can<00:03:23.290> have<00:03:23.409> something<00:03:23.680> for<00:03:24.010> this

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:24.159 
that you can have something for this

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:24.750 
that you can have something for this
kind<00:03:24.400> of<00:03:24.459> money
