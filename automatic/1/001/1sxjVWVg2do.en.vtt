00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
bases but they're not on this well this

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.410 
bases but they're not on this well this
thing<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.100> gonna<00:01:56.219> be<00:01:56.399> fast<00:01:56.700> right<00:01:56.880> out<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.180> the

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
thing is gonna be fast right out of the

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.209 
thing is gonna be fast right out of the
box<00:01:57.570> you're<00:01:57.750> not<00:01:57.930> going<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.229> need<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.710> wax<00:01:58.979> it

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
box you're not going to need to wax it

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.209 
box you're not going to need to wax it
as<00:01:59.520> much<00:02:00.000> as<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.270> sinker<00:02:00.930> base<00:02:01.140> or<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:01.950> base

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
as much as a sinker base or a base

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.130 
as much as a sinker base or a base
that's<00:02:02.640> more<00:02:03.210> porous<00:02:03.659> intense

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
that's more porous intense

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.960 
that's more porous intense
the<00:02:04.710> edges<00:02:05.130> are<00:02:05.509> the<00:02:06.509> cruise<00:02:06.780> control

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
the edges are the cruise control

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.780 
the edges are the cruise control
so<00:02:08.300> they're<00:02:08.509> there<00:02:09.380> a<00:02:09.590> little<00:02:10.460> bit<00:02:10.580> more

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
so they're there a little bit more

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.270 
so they're there a little bit more
mellow<00:02:11.090> they're<00:02:11.330> not<00:02:11.450> going<00:02:11.690> to<00:02:12.100> catch<00:02:13.100> you<00:02:13.250> up

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280
