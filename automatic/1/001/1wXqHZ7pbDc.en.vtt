 Poaching reduces the stock of animals in the area 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.520
 That's why the WWF continues to insist on regular patrols 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.080
 trained gamekeepers especially patrols walking through the rainforest 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:17.820
 Each year, around 500 of these control tours are conducted each year 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.460
 Team consists of at least seven individuals wild-seeking clues and and 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.380
 carriers 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.890
 Their walk takes five to seven days to equip their weapons and equipment 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.410
 Ammunition navigation equipment catering and very important drugs for the 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.260
 emergency 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.840
 The goal is to track down the heavily armed poachers in the rainforest and get stuck 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.820
 close 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.170
 Winnenden 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.320
 There are also patrols on the only Lindenstraße through the 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.079
 rainforest 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:56.940
 the project area with the outside world the work of the patrols in dense 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.650
 Rainforest is risky 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.650
 like steel for when you can not see 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.950
 and sometimes it also changes on foot 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.300
 or they encounter filling or elephants that are often immobile in the forest 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.899
 stand 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:12.899
 and suddenly attack when approaching 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.120
 The goal is above all to make the cruel fall of the pictures harmless 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.490
 With the help of PID can take more than twenty thousand slings in 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.220
 found and neutralized in the last half a year 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.630
 Clarify moment 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.920
 and Prof more 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.620
 betting 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.580
 compared to 11 percent 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.840
 Löwenberg be determined 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.640
 Now you can keep it anyway 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.660
 Gladbeck 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.660
 we are far from it 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.670
 by almost 5 percent 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.670
 Reutlingen dpa 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.010
 not affected were the 5 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:11.080
 Vaduz this is now Dez's the VR leasing fun secondly 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.080
 hospital ship 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:18.340
 Jan Hommen of course, the testers can get the lead 

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:21.889

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:38.419
 one had to start 

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:42.359
 this number shows the enormous extent of the forbidden hunt in the national park 

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:46.759
 That's why it's so important that the WWF is here
