have to do is go find out what or find
your<00:00:31.669> your<00:00:32.669> download<00:00:33.120> so<00:00:33.660> in<00:00:33.780> my<00:00:33.899> case<00:00:33.960> I've

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
your your download so in my case I've

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
dot f XP file types in here now I'll

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.810 
dot f XP file types in here now I'll
show<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.120> on<00:00:42.480> for<00:00:43.260> loops<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.590> do<00:00:43.820> what

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
show you on for loops to do what

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.990 
show you on for loops to do what
typically<00:00:45.180> happens<00:00:45.800> so<00:00:46.800> once<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.640> go<00:00:47.730> here

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
typically happens so once you go here

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.779 
typically happens so once you go here
open<00:00:48.570> up<00:00:48.600> your<00:00:49.850> Nexus<00:00:51.110> and<00:00:52.579> normally<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.670> go

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
open up your Nexus and normally you go

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.200 
open up your Nexus and normally you go
to<00:00:53.850> system<00:00:54.590> import<00:00:55.590> data<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.100> then<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:56.879> look

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
to system import data and then you look

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.029 
to system import data and then you look
for<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.420> expansion<00:00:58.289> pack<00:00:58.500> however<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.010> course

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
for the expansion pack however of course

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.459 
for the expansion pack however of course
even<00:00:59.670> with<00:00:59.760> all<00:00:59.940> type<00:01:00.210> selected<00:01:00.780> you're<00:01:01.289> not

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
even with all type selected you're not

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.939 
even with all type selected you're not
going<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.680> see<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.239> files<00:01:03.589> so<00:01:04.589> what<00:01:04.830> I've

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
go to Program Files and this may vary

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.539 
go to Program Files and this may vary
depending<00:01:21.990> where<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.380> install<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.799> mines<00:01:23.369> at

VST plugins they've got a nexus content
and<00:01:29.640> now<00:01:29.820> we're<00:01:30.479> going<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.659> presets<00:01:31.200> now<00:01:32.189> all

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
and now we're going to presets now all

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:40.069 
and now we're going to presets now all
here<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:33.060> where<00:01:33.720> most<00:01:34.439> of<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.750> Nexus<00:01:39.079> Nexus

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
here is where most of the Nexus Nexus

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.899 
here is where most of the Nexus Nexus
type<00:01:40.470> things<00:01:40.740> on<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.040> library<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.460> know<00:01:41.610> the

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
type things on the library you know the

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:48.889 
type things on the library you know the
arpeggio<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.780> base<00:01:42.990> Gaskell<00:01:47.090> so<00:01:48.090> in<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.630> case

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
arpeggio is base Gaskell so in this case

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:49.969 
arpeggio is base Gaskell so in this case
what<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.079> want<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.290> do<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.680> you're<00:01:49.799> going<00:01:49.920> to

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
what you want to do is you're going to

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.800 
what you want to do is you're going to
get<00:01:50.100> your<00:01:50.520> expansion<00:01:50.909> pack<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.509> you're<00:01:51.689> going

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
get your expansion pack and you're going

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.660 
get your expansion pack and you're going
to<00:01:51.869> drag<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.439> drop<00:01:52.500> or<00:01:53.009> copy<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.340> paste<00:01:53.399> for

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
to drag and drop or copy and paste for

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.590 
to drag and drop or copy and paste for
everyone<00:01:54.119> into<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.140> presets<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.799> know<00:01:56.600> so

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
everyone into the presets you know so

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.020 
everyone into the presets you know so
you<00:01:58.170> just<00:01:58.320> continue<00:01:58.649> adding<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.579> Sherpas<00:01:59.939> a

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
you just continue adding the Sherpas a

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.780 
you just continue adding the Sherpas a
little<00:02:00.719> bit<00:02:00.920> administrative<00:02:01.920> permission<00:02:02.520> and

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
little bit administrative permission and

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.410 
little bit administrative permission and
it<00:02:03.420> should<00:02:03.570> be<00:02:03.960> on<00:02:04.049> here<00:02:04.229> not<00:02:04.409> so<00:02:04.770> chapter<00:02:05.100> die

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
it should be on here not so chapter die

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.589 
it should be on here not so chapter die
so<00:02:06.420> now<00:02:06.570> we'll<00:02:06.750> go<00:02:06.869> back<00:02:06.899> onto<00:02:07.320> FL<00:02:07.740> Studio<00:02:08.099> and

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
so now we'll go back onto FL Studio and

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:14.030 
so now we'll go back onto FL Studio and
we'll<00:02:09.599> check<00:02:09.899> our<00:02:10.520> Nexus<00:02:11.520> again

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.280 

now<00:02:15.040> in<00:02:15.250> this<00:02:15.340> case<00:02:15.610> we<00:02:16.000> may<00:02:16.210> have<00:02:16.510> to<00:02:16.750> restart

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
now in this case we may have to restart

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.920 
now in this case we may have to restart

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:37.260 

alright<00:02:30.959> so<00:02:31.959> place<00:02:32.709> that<00:02:33.040> with<00:02:33.340> Nexus<00:02:36.270> and

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270
