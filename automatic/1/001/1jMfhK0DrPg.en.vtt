00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:03.840
 a day so I'm going to introduce you not wrong 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.770
 it consists of a tube of glue 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.770
 you are looking for the most accomplished 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.819
 it's a small tube of glue 

00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:14.929
 so I ripped off I'm going to remove the cap and sarah from us 

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:17.800
 on the side where I pulled off the plug 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.550
 the coconut team 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.260
 it's a simple marker or cuttings the little tube of 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:25.079
 glue 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:28.079
 on the big tube of hot glue two holes here 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.150
 she forecasts 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.660
 the iron wire 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.760
 who goes in the first little scoop and then to hang on to the party 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.890
 mechanical here 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.250
 very important otherwise it will not be very well 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.990
 will have to put your finger on electric wires and so it's a little 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.940
 very bad 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.350
 then the small dg hole here that we see the entity 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.400
 because if we are neither speech is possible 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.250
 the final customs officers in career this one what is appropriate 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.100
 pharmaceutical if you do not have 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.420
 but yes 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.750
 clear 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.280
 what to do then 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.220
 he also writes that when he attended a few days ago a small 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.220
 spark 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.370
 autonomy 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.410
 then we will do 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.410
 do you commit does not agree it's actually inside 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.400
 he's not wrong 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.100
 but he has to come inside the truck in the form of gaston kelman 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.060
 but if it's an in the game 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.590
 with small oxygen stuff what 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.060
 and the limitations of lacc odile 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.520
 marry as 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.500
 smells so if the products and main is that if the products of 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.380
 toilet happened 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.380
 it's so it will not work 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.210
 a family 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.630
 once is not customary it's sure it's easier 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.240
 everywhere and that's annoying it's because 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.250
 to shoot it's not very easy to use 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.800
 Me personally 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.190
 I do not take the potatoes the controversy took pole because a few weeks 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.019
 so it took everything I want 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.019
 but what can I talk about 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.989
 we want you to take a tomato what's going on as long as it's this sect 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.689
 his morning coat 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:22.939
 it takes oxygen 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:24.629
 so we blow 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.629
 they have lost their roofs 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:38.509
 it's no longer charter 08 

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:41.509
 exit for life or their transfer 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.679
 a performance that support the team air france 

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:48.389
 the C 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:51.389
 because it was 4 5 times 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:55.659
 French patience and oxygen touchscreen 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:57.819
 r if I mean 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.019
 cdi
