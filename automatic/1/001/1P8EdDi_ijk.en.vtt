00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.509 
made friends sort of there and then a
while<00:02:29.659> stalking<00:02:30.230> in<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.590> cage<00:02:30.799> I<00:02:31.069> let<00:02:31.280> them

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
while stalking in the cage I let them

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.280 
while stalking in the cage I let them
run<00:02:31.700> around<00:02:31.730> in<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.180> bathroom<00:02:32.719> with

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
run around in the bathroom with

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.559 
run around in the bathroom with
supervision<00:02:33.980> just<00:02:34.489> in<00:02:34.639> case<00:02:34.849> any<00:02:35.120> of<00:02:35.209> them<00:02:35.389> did

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
supervision just in case any of them did

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.619 
supervision just in case any of them did
fight<00:02:35.810> and<00:02:36.489> I<00:02:37.489> left<00:02:37.819> them<00:02:38.000> in<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.180> bathroom

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
fight and I left them in the bathroom

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:40.629 
fight and I left them in the bathroom
for<00:02:38.870> about<00:02:38.900> an<00:02:39.139> hour<00:02:39.290> and<00:02:39.769> because<00:02:40.519> it's

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:40.639 
for about an hour and because it's

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:43.059 
for about an hour and because it's
neutral<00:02:40.969> territory<00:02:41.450> and<00:02:41.719> there<00:02:41.930> none<00:02:42.769> of<00:02:42.799> them

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
neutral territory and there none of them

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:44.890 
neutral territory and there none of them
could<00:02:43.250> really<00:02:43.609> claim<00:02:43.969> it<00:02:44.000> as<00:02:44.269> their<00:02:44.299> own<00:02:44.480> so<00:02:44.840> it

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
could really claim it as their own so it

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.949 
could really claim it as their own so it
couldn't<00:02:45.139> really<00:02:45.260> be<00:02:45.379> dominant<00:02:45.799> and<00:02:46.810> all<00:02:47.810> that

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
couldn't really be dominant and all that

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.640 
couldn't really be dominant and all that
went<00:02:48.139> on<00:02:48.319> there<00:02:48.379> was<00:02:48.590> a<00:02:48.680> lot<00:02:48.980> of<00:02:49.239> sniffing<00:02:50.239> and

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
went on there was a lot of sniffing and

went on there was a lot of sniffing and
goose<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:51.799> Hercules<00:02:52.220> because<00:02:52.549> they're<00:02:52.730> a

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
goose and Hercules because they're a

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.179 
goose and Hercules because they're a
little<00:02:52.939> bit<00:02:53.150> older<00:02:53.569> and<00:02:53.810> they<00:02:54.590> were<00:02:54.650> sniffing

lot of purring and strutting and

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.069 
lot of purring and strutting and
wiggling<00:03:03.019> their<00:03:03.230> bum<00:03:03.439> side<00:03:03.859> to<00:03:04.099> side<00:03:04.340> and<00:03:05.120> a

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
wiggling their bum side to side and a

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:07.780 
wiggling their bum side to side and a
little<00:03:06.439> bit<00:03:06.500> of<00:03:06.560> mounting<00:03:07.099> went<00:03:07.340> on<00:03:07.549> but

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
little bit of mounting went on but

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.119 
little bit of mounting went on but
that's<00:03:08.000> also<00:03:08.269> just<00:03:08.510> again<00:03:09.109> to<00:03:09.379> assert<00:03:09.829> who's

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:10.129 
that's also just again to assert who's

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:13.149 
that's also just again to assert who's
the<00:03:10.400> dominant<00:03:11.150> pig<00:03:11.389> and<00:03:12.260> as<00:03:12.500> you<00:03:12.650> can<00:03:12.799> see<00:03:12.829> now

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:13.159 
the dominant pig and as you can see now

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:15.699 
the dominant pig and as you can see now
Hercules<00:03:13.489> the<00:03:14.000> sort<00:03:14.269> of<00:03:14.359> sniffing<00:03:15.319> almost

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
Hercules the sort of sniffing almost

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.270 
Hercules the sort of sniffing almost
kissing<00:03:16.120> chewy<00:03:17.349> which<00:03:18.349> i<00:03:18.650> think<00:03:18.829> is<00:03:19.040> another

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
kissing chewy which i think is another

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.559 
kissing chewy which i think is another
way<00:03:19.430> of<00:03:19.459> them<00:03:19.729> getting<00:03:19.940> to<00:03:20.150> know<00:03:20.269> each<00:03:20.299> other

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
way of them getting to know each other

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.199 
way of them getting to know each other
and<00:03:21.459> they've<00:03:22.459> been<00:03:22.549> in<00:03:22.669> there<00:03:22.760> a<00:03:22.819> couple<00:03:22.879> of

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
and they've been in there a couple of

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.420 
and they've been in there a couple of
days<00:03:23.359> now<00:03:23.419> but<00:03:23.900> as<00:03:24.109> you<00:03:24.349> can<00:03:24.500> see<00:03:24.769> the<00:03:24.949> the<00:03:25.220> baby

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
days now but as you can see the the baby

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.030 
days now but as you can see the the baby
guinea<00:03:25.669> pigs<00:03:25.970> they're<00:03:26.239> not<00:03:26.359> scared<00:03:26.810> of<00:03:27.079> course

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
guinea pigs they're not scared of course

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.939 
guinea pigs they're not scared of course
or<00:03:28.189> Hercules<00:03:28.370> at<00:03:28.849> all<00:03:29.060> and<00:03:29.479> they<00:03:30.049> in<00:03:30.379> fact<00:03:30.650> they

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:30.949 
or Hercules at all and they in fact they

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:33.819 
or Hercules at all and they in fact they
follow<00:03:31.220> them<00:03:31.370> around<00:03:31.459> all<00:03:31.849> day<00:03:32.060> and<00:03:32.530> I<00:03:33.530> think

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
follow them around all day and I think

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:35.259 
follow them around all day and I think
Hercules<00:03:34.220> and<00:03:34.340> Gus<00:03:34.519> might<00:03:34.699> get<00:03:34.879> a<00:03:34.909> little<00:03:35.120> bit

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
Hercules and Gus might get a little bit

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.349 
Hercules and Gus might get a little bit
sick<00:03:35.479> of<00:03:35.599> it<00:03:35.720> after<00:03:35.959> a<00:03:35.989> while<00:03:36.079> and<00:03:37.359> but

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359 
sick of it after a while and but

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:39.939 
sick of it after a while and but
Hercules<00:03:38.510> now<00:03:38.989> with<00:03:39.199> him<00:03:39.349> being<00:03:39.530> the<00:03:39.650> dominant

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:39.949 
Hercules now with him being the dominant

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:42.369 
Hercules now with him being the dominant
guinea<00:03:40.189> pig<00:03:40.459> him<00:03:40.729> Gus<00:03:41.329> is<00:03:41.479> hiding<00:03:41.900> because<00:03:42.109> he

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:42.379 
guinea pig him Gus is hiding because he

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:44.409 
guinea pig him Gus is hiding because he
used<00:03:42.590> to<00:03:42.650> be<00:03:42.739> the<00:03:42.829> dominant<00:03:42.919> one<00:03:43.220> so<00:03:43.609> I<00:03:43.849> think

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:44.419 
used to be the dominant one so I think

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:47.349 
used to be the dominant one so I think
he's<00:03:44.750> having<00:03:44.840> a<00:03:45.079> bit<00:03:45.199> of<00:03:45.229> a<00:03:45.349> shock<00:03:46.209> well<00:03:47.209> there
