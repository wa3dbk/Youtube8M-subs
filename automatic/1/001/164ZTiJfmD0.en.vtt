for those of you who disagree with me

for those of you who disagree with me
that's<00:05:58.290> fine<00:05:58.530> because<00:05:58.770> this<00:05:59.760> is<00:05:59.910> only<00:06:00.090> my

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
that's fine because this is only my

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.880 
that's fine because this is only my
theory<00:06:00.660> and<00:06:01.010> in<00:06:02.010> fact<00:06:02.280> he<00:06:03.180> is<00:06:03.710> hasn't<00:06:04.710> really

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:04.890 
theory and in fact he is hasn't really

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.370 
theory and in fact he is hasn't really
revealed<00:06:05.190> himself<00:06:05.340> yet<00:06:06.050> but<00:06:07.050> it<00:06:07.110> is<00:06:07.140> a<00:06:07.260> nice

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 
revealed himself yet but it is a nice

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.500 
revealed himself yet but it is a nice
little<00:06:07.590> theory<00:06:07.920> and<00:06:08.130> I'm<00:06:08.820> hoping<00:06:09.180> it<00:06:09.390> comes

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:09.510 
little theory and I'm hoping it comes

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.960 
little theory and I'm hoping it comes
true<00:06:09.780> but<00:06:10.650> even<00:06:10.800> if<00:06:11.010> it<00:06:11.160> doesn't<00:06:11.370> is<00:06:11.670> really

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:11.970 
true but even if it doesn't is really

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.350 
true but even if it doesn't is really
fun<00:06:12.180> to<00:06:12.210> imagine<00:06:12.420> that<00:06:12.840> it<00:06:12.990> could<00:06:13.140> be<00:06:14.090> but<00:06:15.090> all

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
fun to imagine that it could be but all

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.210
