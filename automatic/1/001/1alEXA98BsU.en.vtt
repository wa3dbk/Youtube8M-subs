00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:03.570
 the report that we are going to show now is for diabetics 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.920
 researchers at the federal university of são paulo found that using the 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.999
 glucose meter most often during the day helps and a lot in the 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:15.249
 control of blood sugar 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:19.160
 and we will also teach you how to calculate the amount of carbohydrates from 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.160
 each food 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:27.640
 the device that measures the blood sugar rate 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.399
 old acquaintance of people with diabetes the novelty and how it is being used 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.290
 physicians at the federal university of são paulo guide patients to 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.010
 several tests in a single day the patient receives the meter and does the tests at home 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.690
 for three consecutive days 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.180
 before and after the main meals 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.430
 doctors analyze the results and thus 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.440
 more accurate information 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.400
 for example when variations in the disease occur or where 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.410
 time of day the highest blood sugar rate the low 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.400
 after one month of treatment 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.250
 with 70% of the patients being able to control the disease and to eliminate the risks 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.550
 of other health problems 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.980
 one of them is terminal enough besides being cause of blindness 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.540
 hindi vascular problems leading to amputation 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.020
 Henry was all a thousand falling. 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.310
 among men 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.070
 all this can be caused by day 10 control so 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.250
 as important as me 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.420
 another factor that can aggravate the disease 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.460
 it is carelessness with meals 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.100
 I chose to feed 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.439
 so correct it seems that the person with diabetes should take very seriously 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:39.700
 on this 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.830
 the moment of crime 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.570
 the patient learns to count the carbohydrates 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.570
 the 'newspaper today' will teach this technique that the 21 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.740
 the nutritionist explains that we each year more about two thousand calories 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.980
 vital as a reference also by gram of 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.280
 carbohydrate day 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.520
 It's a pleasure to work with a banana has nothing. 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.850
 the carbohydrate program 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.680
 the downgrade to 79 during the day is weak in redistribution this 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.869
 during Sunday afternoon a greater concentration in front of ect 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.200
 informed that the delivery of a work has to cut 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.259
 the position 

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:17.999
 in the case of the state and 50 grams a share and contains 23 grams of 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:18.729
 carbohydrate 

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:22.669
 also in that comparison a person with two thousand calories could construct 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:28.409
 200 grams of carbohydrate would miss 1% 77 grams of beautiful presses during the day 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:33.289
 carbohydrate sugar banishment so it has to come to the blood glucose to 

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:37.149
 people then buy the carbohydrate to have a glycemic control perfectly 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:39.940
 all sides go to the supermarket 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.599
 already keeps an eye on the product label 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.089
 After you started doing this 

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:49.119
 started to eat better than with this low text, so it was also 

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:52.170
 superbom today the council ate everything without worrying 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.109
 much with the issue of planting in the country 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:58.400
 listen to the story you just saw was suggested by yourselves 

00:02:58.399 --> 00:03:00.440
 our viewers 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.820
 and for six they also asked us to put our peace on the internet and the table to 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.870
