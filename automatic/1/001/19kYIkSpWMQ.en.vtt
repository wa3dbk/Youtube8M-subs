00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
well filtered with a you know high-end

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.490 
well filtered with a you know high-end
filtration<00:00:58.440> system<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.420> you<00:01:00.420> know<00:01:00.539> it's<00:01:01.140> it's

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
filtration system and you know it's it's

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.780 
filtration system and you know it's it's
a<00:01:01.590> good<00:01:01.739> tank<00:01:03.290> so<00:01:04.290> if<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:04.920> wanted<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.369> grow<00:01:05.549> this

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
a good tank so if I wanted to grow this

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.580 
a good tank so if I wanted to grow this
in<00:01:05.939> here<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.450> would<00:01:06.689> obviously<00:01:06.840> have<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.560> have

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
in here I would obviously have to have

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.000 
in here I would obviously have to have
the<00:01:08.189> top<00:01:08.580> exposed<00:01:09.380> that<00:01:10.380> means<00:01:10.619> above<00:01:10.890> the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
the top exposed that means above the

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
the top exposed that means above the
surface<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.630> could<00:01:12.630> not<00:01:12.780> in<00:01:13.110> fact<00:01:13.350> fully

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
surface I could not in fact fully

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.070 
surface I could not in fact fully
submerge<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.210> stock<00:01:15.479> because<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:15.960> would

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
submerge the stock because it would

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.260 
submerge the stock because it would
never<00:01:16.259> grow<00:01:16.610> the<00:01:17.610> reason<00:01:17.909> why<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.119> because

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
never grow the reason why is because

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.380 
never grow the reason why is because
when<00:01:18.780> things<00:01:18.960> enter<00:01:19.500> into<00:01:19.759> the<00:01:20.759> center<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.299> the

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
when things enter into the center of the

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.899 
when things enter into the center of the
plant<00:01:21.630> right<00:01:21.840> there<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:22.770> damages<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.700> growth

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
plant right there it damages the growth

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.330 
plant right there it damages the growth
and<00:01:24.750> when<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.080> damages<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.619> growth<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.130> plant

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
and when it damages the growth the plant

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.770 
and when it damages the growth the plant
will<00:01:26.460> no<00:01:26.580> longer<00:01:26.790> grow<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.299> eventually<00:01:27.450> it

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
will no longer grow and eventually it

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.590 
will no longer grow and eventually it
will<00:01:27.810> rot<00:01:28.080> or<00:01:28.590> turn<00:01:28.860> yellow<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.600> effectively

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
will rot or turn yellow and effectively

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.770 
will rot or turn yellow and effectively
just<00:01:30.960> die<00:01:31.310> so<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.729> can't<00:01:32.970> actually<00:01:33.210> do<00:01:33.570> that

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
just die so you can't actually do that

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.770 
just die so you can't actually do that
so<00:01:33.930> when<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.110> see<00:01:34.290> these<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.770> in<00:01:35.549> stores<00:01:36.450> and

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
so when you see these and in stores and

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.940 
so when you see these and in stores and
things<00:01:36.930> like<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.530> they're<00:01:37.650> showing

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
things like that and they're showing

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.649 
things like that and they're showing
them<00:01:38.130> fully<00:01:38.520> submerged<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.270> they're<00:01:39.390> alive

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
them fully submerged and they're alive

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.539 
them fully submerged and they're alive
well<00:01:40.470> trust<00:01:40.770> me<00:01:40.920> they're<00:01:41.070> only<00:01:41.100> going<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.430> be

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
well trust me they're only going to be

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.580 
well trust me they're only going to be
alive<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.240> in<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:43.020> know<00:01:43.140> display

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
alive in that in that you know display

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.069 
alive in that in that you know display
tank<00:01:43.860> at<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.280> store<00:01:45.090> for<00:01:45.360> me<00:01:45.479> about<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.810> week

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
tank at the store for me about a week

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.130 
tank at the store for me about a week
until<00:01:46.259> they<00:01:46.530> finally<00:01:46.890> die<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.390> can<00:01:48.600> grow

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
until they finally die so you can grow

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.840 
until they finally die so you can grow
it<00:01:49.229> like<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.890> have<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.310> have<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.640> top

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
it like that you have to have the top

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.359 
it like that you have to have the top
you<00:01:51.299> know<00:01:51.420> exposed<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.890> bottom<00:01:53.189> root

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
you know exposed and the bottom root

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.429 
you know exposed and the bottom root
system<00:01:53.850> anchored<00:01:54.689> down<00:01:54.869> into<00:01:55.229> something

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
system anchored down into something

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.080 
system anchored down into something
obviously<00:01:56.009> with<00:01:56.219> this<00:01:56.369> tank<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.790> could<00:01:56.939> never

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
obviously with this tank I could never

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.920 
obviously with this tank I could never
do<00:01:57.329> that<00:01:57.509> because<00:01:57.689> it's<00:01:58.500> just<00:01:58.590> too<00:01:58.890> damn<00:01:59.100> tall

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
do that because it's just too damn tall

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.330 
do that because it's just too damn tall
but<00:02:00.930> with<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.140> smaller<00:02:01.500> like<00:02:01.770> ten<00:02:02.009> gallon<00:02:02.310> tank

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
but with a smaller like ten gallon tank

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.450 
but with a smaller like ten gallon tank
you<00:02:02.670> could<00:02:03.149> do<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.710> now<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.770> people<00:02:05.219> say

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
you could do that now the people say

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.330 
you could do that now the people say
that<00:02:05.490> they<00:02:06.000> put<00:02:06.540> they<00:02:06.869> have<00:02:07.170> put<00:02:07.710> lucky<00:02:08.190> bamboo

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
that they put they have put lucky bamboo

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.690 
that they put they have put lucky bamboo
stalks<00:02:08.670> in<00:02:09.259> filters<00:02:10.259> so<00:02:10.890> this<00:02:11.220> filter<00:02:11.430> would

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
stalks in filters so this filter would

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.370 
stalks in filters so this filter would
be<00:02:11.819> impossible<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.480> do<00:02:12.599> that<00:02:12.629> with

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
be impossible to do that with

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.650 
be impossible to do that with
just<00:02:14.010> because<00:02:14.250> there's<00:02:14.400> no<00:02:14.550> room<00:02:14.850> for<00:02:14.880> a<00:02:15.240> lucky

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
just because there's no room for a lucky

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.770 
just because there's no room for a lucky
bamboo<00:02:15.810> stalk<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.580> main<00:02:17.760> reason<00:02:18.090> why<00:02:18.240> you

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
bamboo stalk and the main reason why you

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.600 
bamboo stalk and the main reason why you
know<00:02:18.900> people<00:02:19.260> that<00:02:19.350> me<00:02:19.560> or<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:20.100> companies<00:02:20.460> I

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
know people that me or the companies I

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.160 
know people that me or the companies I
make<00:02:20.790> filters<00:02:21.120> don't<00:02:21.270> leave<00:02:21.540> extra<00:02:21.870> room<00:02:22.080> in

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
make filters don't leave extra room in

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.450 
make filters don't leave extra room in
there<00:02:22.320> because<00:02:22.680> there's<00:02:22.830> really<00:02:22.950> no<00:02:23.190> need<00:02:23.220> to

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
there because there's really no need to

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.660 
there because there's really no need to
add<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:24.480> know<00:02:24.510> plants<00:02:25.140> as<00:02:25.350> a<00:02:25.380> an<00:02:25.920> extra<00:02:26.340> filter

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
add you know plants as a an extra filter

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.970 
add you know plants as a an extra filter
which<00:02:26.880> you<00:02:27.000> know<00:02:27.060> plants<00:02:27.390> do<00:02:27.570> help<00:02:28.440> some<00:02:28.800> way

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
which you know plants do help some way

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.670 
which you know plants do help some way
in<00:02:29.220> filtering<00:02:29.610> stuff<00:02:29.970> but<00:02:30.300> not<00:02:30.540> as<00:02:31.230> much<00:02:31.500> as<00:02:31.650> a

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
in filtering stuff but not as much as a

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.980 
in filtering stuff but not as much as a
filter<00:02:32.070> so<00:02:32.820> that's<00:02:33.420> why<00:02:33.570> they<00:02:33.720> don't<00:02:33.870> add

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
filter so that's why they don't add

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.060 
filter so that's why they don't add
extra<00:02:34.260> space<00:02:34.350> in<00:02:34.620> there<00:02:34.740> because<00:02:34.860> they're

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
extra space in there because they're

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.300 
extra space in there because they're
just<00:02:35.520> as<00:02:35.760> no<00:02:35.880> point<00:02:36.320> now<00:02:37.320> when<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:37.680> add<00:02:37.890> a

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
just as no point now when you add a

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.040 
just as no point now when you add a
lucky<00:02:38.670> bamboo<00:02:38.820> stalk<00:02:39.180> into<00:02:39.420> an<00:02:39.510> aquarium<00:02:39.900> say

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
lucky bamboo stalk into an aquarium say

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.570 
lucky bamboo stalk into an aquarium say
that<00:02:40.200> you<00:02:40.290> could<00:02:40.500> actually<00:02:40.680> do<00:02:41.010> it<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.310> keep

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
that you could actually do it and keep

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.880 
that you could actually do it and keep
the<00:02:41.730> top<00:02:41.910> you<00:02:42.210> know<00:02:42.300> not<00:02:42.510> submerge<00:02:42.960> when<00:02:43.770> you

do it how are you gonna fertilize the

do it how are you gonna fertilize the
planet<00:02:46.790> because<00:02:48.290> I've<00:02:49.290> been<00:02:49.410> telling<00:02:49.740> people

planet because I've been telling people
for<00:02:50.010> years<00:02:50.220> you<00:02:50.670> know<00:02:50.700> lucky<00:02:51.090> bamboo<00:02:51.210> is<00:02:51.480> not

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
for years you know lucky bamboo is not

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.170 
for years you know lucky bamboo is not
an<00:02:51.720> aquatic<00:02:52.020> plant<00:02:52.200> so<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.550> fertilizers

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
an aquatic plant so the the fertilizers

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.260 
an aquatic plant so the the fertilizers
they<00:02:54.330> sell<00:02:54.570> at<00:02:54.810> fish<00:02:55.080> stores<00:02:55.350> you<00:02:55.650> know<00:02:55.710> for

they sell at fish stores you know for

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.570 
they sell at fish stores you know for
aquarium<00:02:57.270> plants<00:02:57.690> are<00:02:57.870> not<00:02:58.050> the<00:02:58.320> same<00:02:58.500> and<00:02:58.890> are

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
aquarium plants are not the same and are

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.360 
aquarium plants are not the same and are

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
not going to do the same things to lucky

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.100 
not going to do the same things to lucky
bamboo<00:03:02.520> or<00:03:02.850> and<00:03:02.940> it's<00:03:03.060> not<00:03:03.180> going<00:03:03.300> to<00:03:03.390> give<00:03:03.990> it

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
bamboo or and it's not going to give it

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.140 
bamboo or and it's not going to give it
the<00:03:04.140> same<00:03:04.440> ability<00:03:04.980> to<00:03:05.070> grow<00:03:05.280> you<00:03:05.580> know<00:03:05.700> faster

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
the same ability to grow you know faster

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.480 
the same ability to grow you know faster
and<00:03:06.300> things<00:03:06.510> like<00:03:06.690> that<00:03:06.900> so<00:03:07.530> you<00:03:07.950> really<00:03:07.980> can't

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
and things like that so you really can't

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.210 
and things like that so you really can't
fertilize<00:03:08.940> it<00:03:09.120> at<00:03:09.270> all<00:03:09.420> and<00:03:09.720> you<00:03:10.650> also<00:03:10.800> run<00:03:11.100> the

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
fertilize it at all and you also run the

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.890 
fertilize it at all and you also run the
risk<00:03:11.430> of<00:03:11.700> you<00:03:11.910> know<00:03:12.000> hurting<00:03:12.240> your<00:03:12.420> fish<00:03:12.660> by

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
risk of you know hurting your fish by

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.630 
risk of you know hurting your fish by
them<00:03:13.200> eating<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.650> roots<00:03:13.890> because<00:03:14.340> lucky

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
them eating the roots because lucky

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.090 
them eating the roots because lucky
bamboo<00:03:14.880> once<00:03:15.330> again<00:03:15.630> is<00:03:15.810> not<00:03:16.040> meant<00:03:17.040> for

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
bamboo once again is not meant for

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.250 
bamboo once again is not meant for
aquariums<00:03:17.760> and<00:03:18.030> who's<00:03:18.360> to<00:03:18.510> say<00:03:18.690> that<00:03:18.720> it's<00:03:19.110> not

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
aquariums and who's to say that it's not

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.440 
aquariums and who's to say that it's not
toxic<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:20.070> roots<00:03:20.310> aren't<00:03:20.460> toxic<00:03:20.940> for<00:03:21.120> plants

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
toxic the roots aren't toxic for plants

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.540 
toxic the roots aren't toxic for plants
all<00:03:21.870> right<00:03:22.050> or<00:03:22.290> this<00:03:22.500> sorry<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.160> roots<00:03:23.370> aren't

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
all right or this sorry the roots aren't

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.810 
all right or this sorry the roots aren't
toxic<00:03:23.790> for<00:03:24.180> fish<00:03:24.560> so<00:03:25.560> that's<00:03:26.280> another<00:03:26.610> risk

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
toxic for fish so that's another risk

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.810 
toxic for fish so that's another risk
that<00:03:26.940> you<00:03:27.120> run<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:28.220> some<00:03:29.220> more<00:03:29.370> risks<00:03:29.700> are

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
that you run and some more risks are

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.670 
that you run and some more risks are
basically<00:03:30.270> that<00:03:30.600> you<00:03:30.840> know<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:31.230> plant<00:03:31.500> will

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
basically that you know the plant will

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.650 
basically that you know the plant will
just<00:03:31.890> eventually<00:03:32.820> rot<00:03:33.030> and<00:03:33.210> die<00:03:33.390> because

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
just eventually rot and die because

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.080 
just eventually rot and die because
they're<00:03:34.200> not<00:03:34.320> meant<00:03:34.620> to<00:03:34.680> be<00:03:34.890> you<00:03:35.220> know<00:03:35.340> grown

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
they're not meant to be you know grown

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.920 
they're not meant to be you know grown
in<00:03:36.240> water<00:03:36.560> now<00:03:37.560> I<00:03:37.950> know<00:03:38.880> you<00:03:39.030> may<00:03:39.420> see<00:03:39.480> that<00:03:39.750> I

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
in water now I know you may see that I

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.440
