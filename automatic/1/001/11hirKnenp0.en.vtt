00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.660
 [Music] 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:26.989
 [Music] 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:36.249
 for the base we choose a card of 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.249
 medium thickness we take the measurements 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.579
 and Italian 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:52.830
 with a daughter we mark the points of 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.410
 fold as indicated in the template then 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:01:17.730
 fold 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:17.730
 [Music] 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.910
 Now choose the covering paper 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:28.010
 internal and external 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:30.570
 [Music] 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.690
 then we apply it with tape 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:02:08.130
 biadhesive 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:02:08.130
 [Music] 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.739
 before applying the coating in the 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.440
 part with the fold of the bottom in the part 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.650
 internal 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.970
 we make a small cut in the bordeaux 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.740
 so that we can pass 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:31.119
 through a closing ribbon 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.119
 [Music] 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.560
 and then we fix by applying over the 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.560
 coating 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:49.610
 [Music] 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:58.920
 take two more cards and 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.340
 we draw framed inside 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:22.879
 leaving a cm from the edge 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:22.879
 [Music] 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.819
 we cut off one of the four sides 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.220
 [Music] 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:36.729
 and also the remaining corners 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:36.729
 [Music] 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:43.330
 draw the second square leaving 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.670
 always one centimeter from the first 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.270
 [Music] 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:52.929
 we cut avenues the second square 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.929
 [Music] 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:01.030
 we will have thus obtained a frame with three 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.780
 fins we're going to bend with 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:29.959
 the aid of night 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:29.959
 [Music] 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:41.000
 we apply the frames inside the 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:43.210
 mini album with v adhesive on the three 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.210
 sides 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:05:21.850
 [Music] 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:45.400
 we decorate to taste 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:48.040
 [Music] 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:56.120
 It's time to insert our photos 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:56.120
 [Music] 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:15.580
 now we glue on the front tab 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:47.050
 another piece of tape is one 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:48.840
 floral decoration in this way 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:07:02.710
 we can close the bag 

00:06:48.840 --> 00:07:06.580
 [Music] 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:09.590
 this mini album is quick and easy 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:13.760
 suitable to be given to the best 

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:15.710
 friend to the boyfriend or as a souvenir 

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:18.740
 if you want you can also apply a 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:21.760
 handle with another ribbon and make 

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.760
 complete the bag 

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:43.079
 I hope you enjoyed it next time 

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:43.079
