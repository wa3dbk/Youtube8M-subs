 discs with the falafel let's add 2 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.920
 tablespoons of flour this will help us 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.860
 that sticks a little more our 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.290
 chickpea from our onion and so on 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.840

 with the total of ingredients that I 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.820
 Say and be in about 8 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.460
 burgers I'm going to do 4 this time 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.770
 but I'm going to keep my falafel I'm going to 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.500
 store in the freezer and you can 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.899
 last up to a month if they have falafel 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.610

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.290
 size of one according to say and fry 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.940
 they are also very very rich this 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.820
 saucer since we have completely 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.440
 fried our falafel records let's go 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.960
 to make the assembly of our hamburger 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.340
 for this we are going to take a bit of 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:28.760
 our tahini let's put the part 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.760
 of bread 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.490
 it's a little bit we're going to take our disk 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:41.310
 we are going to put it 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:45.680
 if we are going to put a little tomato 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.680
 and we are going to finish 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.330
 with our avocado humus 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.690

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.310
 and also put lettuce is a choice 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.020
 of each person and at the time of 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.070
 try those hamburgers to see how 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:09.740
 they are very very very rich in 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:13.100
 versions I recommend that you make them 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:15.599
 As you can see they are a little 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:20.580
 they are going to stain their fingers 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:24.390
 they are delicious here I have my family 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.390
