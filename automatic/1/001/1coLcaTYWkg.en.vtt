next<00:02:36.450> two<00:02:36.569> games<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.230> if<00:02:37.980> we<00:02:38.190> play<00:02:38.519> the<00:02:38.730> way<00:02:38.880> we

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
next two games and if we play the way we

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.930 
next two games and if we play the way we
did<00:02:39.269> today<00:02:39.450> we<00:02:40.170> certainly<00:02:40.590> should<00:02:41.010> win<00:02:41.549> gold

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
did today we certainly should win gold

did today we certainly should win gold
but<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.660> big<00:02:42.840> question<00:02:42.870> is<00:02:43.440> can<00:02:43.590> we<00:02:43.829> sustain

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
but the big question is can we sustain

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.640 
but the big question is can we sustain
this<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:44.970> if<00:02:45.690> we're<00:02:45.930> going<00:02:46.019> to<00:02:46.079> have<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.380> rely

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
this and if we're going to have to rely

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.380 
this and if we're going to have to rely
