00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
used on a regular basis might have been

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.229 
used on a regular basis might have been
the<00:00:34.170> lethal<00:00:35.070> weapons<00:00:35.399> stunt<00:00:35.730> show<00:00:35.910> back<00:00:36.120> in

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
SNS free spin like we saw in Fiesta

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.210 
SNS free spin like we saw in Fiesta
Texas<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:21.030> year<00:01:21.090> or<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.869> B&amp;M<00:01:22.710> wing<00:01:22.950> coaster

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
Texas this year or a B&amp;M wing coaster

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.800 
Texas this year or a B&amp;M wing coaster
and<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:24.210> mean<00:01:24.330> if<00:01:24.420> they're<00:01:24.540> going<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.720> do

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
and I mean if they're going to do

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:25.609 
and I mean if they're going to do
something<00:01:24.960> that's<00:01:25.140> going<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.290> take<00:01:25.409> up<00:01:25.530> this

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
something that's going to take up this

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.060 
something that's going to take up this
whole<00:01:25.830> plot<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.369> land<00:01:26.869> here<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:28.439> will<00:01:28.650> not<00:01:28.799> be

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
whole plot of land here it will not be

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.649 
whole plot of land here it will not be
the<00:01:29.220> free<00:01:29.460> spin<00:01:29.759> because<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.119> free<00:01:30.270> spin<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.570> a

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
the free spin because the free spin is a

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.499 
the free spin because the free spin is a
relatively<00:01:31.320> compact<00:01:31.770> ride<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:33.240> mean<00:01:33.390> this

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
relatively compact ride and I mean this

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.969 
relatively compact ride and I mean this
is<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.659> great<00:01:33.990> piece<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.229> property<00:01:34.350> here<00:01:34.829> can

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
is a great piece of property here can

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.130 
is a great piece of property here can
you<00:01:35.009> get<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.250> lake<00:01:35.490> right<00:01:36.000> there<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:37.049> you

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
you get the lake right there so you

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.390 
you get the lake right there so you
