00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 This has turned you into 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.870
 the real conqueror of the trophic routes 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.529
 all the work on fine-tuning the author 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.230
 the project 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.059
 did the actual manual detailed 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.370
 knowledge of the material part is necessary 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:19.170
 conditions of successful overcoming of off-road 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.240
 I 've seen exactly the same number of times 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.140
 described the picture when a person took away 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.630
 heaps of cars 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.000
 dumping there a large amount of money 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.570
 getting such a prepared SUV 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.780
 his requests, he immediately sat behind the wheel 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.230
 I was driving far away on the way I was moving 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.230
 from the road 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:43.290
 technique he broke and that's it 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.379
 stayed there for a few days in 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.450
 while waiting to come to his aid in 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.829
 such cases as I have already seen 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.309
 countless exactly when 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.980
 ignorance of own car not 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.550
 ability to foresee his failure of ignorance 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.410
 the technical part about how it works 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.600
 result in that instead of getting 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.299
 pleasures you have on your head 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.380
 problems associated with stopping vehicles 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.330
 from evacuation off-road arsenal any 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.330
 off-road cars is determined by several 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.700
 the main components of the wheel road 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.439
 clearance motor all-wheel drive system 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.770
 surely the wheels up first 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:25.479
 this is unconditionally any car on 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.850
 right wheels becomes already 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.140
 serious SUV wheels first 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.539
 all come first 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:37.360
 why wheels are desirable 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:40.299
 official tread I had the property 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.000
 ride a small diameter 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:45.369
 wheels 33 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.289
 quite evil figure and compare 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.240
 your car system cars 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:50.890
 which is on the big wheels more about 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.810
 why not 35 35 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:57.069
 but relatively without evil I can say 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.560
 what little angry wheels 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:05.579
 permeability is significantly higher than large but 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:08.170
 slicks so put in first place 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:12.340
 wheels to second place unconditional 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:14.349
 the ground clearance is higher than he 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.819
 farther you can drive in but the road 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.150
 lumen ok I'm the second time 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.560
 big by angry wheels he's about something 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.299
 can only be useful on some 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.079
 rough terrain with solid 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:27.220
 mud cover 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:29.829
 useless without even sitting on the lights on 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.709
 what not moschino moschino what machine 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:34.329
 will just polish the dirt and nowhere 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.340
 move and say it according to your experience 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:39.370
 land cruiser cars which was 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.950
 equipped with rubber class and you are relatively 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.400
 big without touching a single detail 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.530
 car for soil nowhere sitting on that 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.410
 no less had the opportunity often 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.940
 move just stand and grind like 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:56.540
 over the ice wheel 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:59.750
 reduction reduction than she 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.750
 perhaps below a certain level 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:06.490
 the better the car rides because cues 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.480
 big tariff 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.460
 transmission ratio 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:15.830
 allows you to move to wear on slow 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:19.240
 speed without tearing the wheels in boxes with this 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:21.590
 most do not bury the car even deeper 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.690
 but to a certain limit too 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.540
 a big reduction turns a car into 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.850
 snail and this is frequent he just doesn't have 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.500
 inertial course to drive 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:35.060
 some place after redux and worth 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.550
 engine in my opinion next 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.200
 our list is by far the engine for 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:43.150
 The SUV should have a big 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:46.630
 torque shifted down and 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:50.480
 it is desirable to be resistant to 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:53.660
 all sorts of things like water and mud 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.230
 so that it does not happen to check in ford 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.230
 for example not 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:01.790
 not bad bones from water 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.830
 preferably engine of course have 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.500
 large volume since large 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.810
 innovative mass of 2 moving parts 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.090
 The engine allows you to move 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.040
 lets fall in love with tension but here 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.470
 conflicting what engine 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.150
 should be easier than lighter engine 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.400
 the lighter the machine, the further it can 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:22.280
 drive in a big heavy car with a big 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.590
 good powerful low torque motor 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.360
 high torque low reduction 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.160
 darker can't drive as far as 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.410
 let's say some kind of light car 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.740
 scraping racist engine that is here 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.660
 must watch 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:39.150
 weight proportions walking support points 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:41.099
 wheel widths and so on preparing 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.520
 off-road technology to professional 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:46.889
 freak requires large financial costs 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.940
 wheels on the winch installation work on 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:50.190
 everyone needs money 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.360
 wanting to save money and turn to 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.000
 domestic products 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.030
 automakers the main argument is not 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.250
 the benefit of our machines is low reliability and 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.860
 but Oise is still in service 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.370
 no event trail is complete 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:07.530
 without the participation of Ulyanovsk SUVs 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.569
 real frame jeeps on the continuous 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.440
 bridges are gradually removed from 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:14.430
 production 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:17.360
 Well , you donkey showing the conveyor to leave 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.360
 not going
