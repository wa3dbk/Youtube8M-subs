00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.309
 union hold on are a collection of 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.620
 indie games or developed freely 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:07.720
 by its creators but that its creators 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:10.360
 they are not ea or lego nor sony nor director 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.330

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.840
 games inter game game main beach 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.220
 tomorrow corporation that surely if 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.050
 you have heard about them is 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.000
 because I had already played indie games and 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.070
 they have previously developed 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.020
 another or because I loan all of you 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.539
 friends but it's also not known as 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.100
 if they tell you nintendo they are developers 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:31.000
 independents who make their own 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.310
 games 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.539
 most are very simple games but 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.899
 that can have very 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:39.940
 interesting and be very very entertaining 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:43.780
 because he lives this because I am 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.130
 talking about computing them because I 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.890
 for example, 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.979
 last time I wanted to buy this great game that 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.780
 is lawson outs what happens with a sounded 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.990
 that had a price of nine euros in 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:59.200
 steam is a game a tower of fendt that 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.750
 it is to the smell but in 2d and with a view a 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.579
 little different and the truth that has very 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.079
 very good looking to the game I have friends 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.000
 who are currently playing and there is a 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:08.500
 great community of players and the truth 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.700
 I really wanted to play it but 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.970
 Now that was worth 9 eurazos then yesterday 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:20.700
 my friend pepe tells me 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:25.740

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.540
 it cost only 0 82 cents and I say 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.600
 I do not believe it I do not believe it 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.850
 because because a game that's worth 9 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.070
 dollars this worth another 5 dollars 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.930

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.840
