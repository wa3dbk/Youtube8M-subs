00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
but I recommend only doing slams so

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.170 
but I recommend only doing slams so
probably<00:01:10.350> greco-roman<00:01:11.070> style<00:01:11.460> fighters<00:01:12.000> or

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
probably greco-roman style fighters or

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.120 
probably greco-roman style fighters or
just<00:01:12.390> straight<00:01:12.570> up<00:01:12.600> wrestlers<00:01:13.170> just<00:01:13.710> for<00:01:13.950> you

you<00:01:17.430> want<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.759> be<00:01:17.850> creative<00:01:18.299> because<00:01:18.720> this

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
you want to be creative because this

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.990

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.300 
takedowns while I'm in the clinch mainly
because<00:01:30.840> my<00:01:31.170> opponent<00:01:31.380> won't<00:01:31.650> be<00:01:31.829> as<00:01:31.950> fit<00:01:32.159> them

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
because my opponent won't be as fit them

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.069 
because my opponent won't be as fit them
to<00:01:32.400> take<00:01:32.640> them<00:01:32.880> if<00:01:33.119> he's<00:01:33.570> suspecting<00:01:34.020> the

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
to take them if he's suspecting the

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.240 
to take them if he's suspecting the
takedown<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.619> course<00:01:34.799> it's<00:01:35.009> going<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.189> be

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
takedown of course it's going to be

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.520 
takedown of course it's going to be
easier<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.909> stop<00:01:36.180> so<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:36.689> want<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.110> creative

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
easier to stop so you want you creative

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.170 
easier to stop so you want you creative
with<00:01:37.710> these<00:01:37.829> takedowns<00:01:38.340> getting<00:01:39.030> in<00:01:39.119> the

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
with these takedowns getting in the

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.359 
with these takedowns getting in the
clinch<00:01:39.479> then<00:01:39.900> take<00:01:40.140> them<00:01:40.290> down<00:01:40.500> or<00:01:40.920> get<00:01:41.220> your

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
clinch then take them down or get your

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.399 
clinch then take them down or get your
opponent<00:01:41.729> up<00:01:41.820> against<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.270> cage<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.930> go<00:01:43.170> for

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
opponent up against the cage and go for

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.440 
opponent up against the cage and go for
a<00:01:43.439> trip<00:01:43.710> those<00:01:44.070> are<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.340> best<00:01:44.549> ways<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:45.119> get

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
a trip those are the best ways to get

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.789 
a trip those are the best ways to get
your<00:01:45.600> opponent<00:01:45.930> down<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.290> ground<00:01:46.439> in<00:01:46.770> my

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
your opponent down to the ground in my

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.649 
your opponent down to the ground in my
opinion<00:01:47.399> that's<00:01:47.700> what<00:01:47.880> worked<00:01:48.060> for<00:01:48.119> me<00:01:48.270> anyway

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
opinion that's what worked for me anyway

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.420

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
you so you see right here I'm just

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.760 
you so you see right here I'm just
spinning<00:02:06.360> through<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.719> takedown<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.469> course

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
spinning through the takedown of course

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.350 
spinning through the takedown of course
I'm<00:02:07.890> stopping<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.340> few<00:02:08.489> but<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:09.030> know<00:02:09.090> my

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
I'm stopping a few but I know my

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.180 
I'm stopping a few but I know my
opponent<00:02:09.810> wants<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.200> go<00:02:10.319> for<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.560> takedown<00:02:10.770> so<00:02:11.129> I

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
opponent wants to go for a takedown so I

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.770 
opponent wants to go for a takedown so I
keep<00:02:11.370> doing<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.730> same<00:02:11.760> kick<00:02:12.270> and

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
keep doing the same kick and

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.360 
keep doing the same kick and
you<00:02:12.990> see<00:02:13.170> how<00:02:13.290> that<00:02:13.350> ends<00:02:13.650> up<00:02:13.830> for<00:02:14.100> him<00:02:14.190> right

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
you see how that ends up for him right

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.460 
you see how that ends up for him right
so<00:02:15.000> you<00:02:15.090> can't<00:02:15.420> become<00:02:15.720> predictable<00:02:16.350> with

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
so you can't become predictable with

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.440 
so you can't become predictable with
takedowns<00:02:16.920> and<00:02:17.220> when<00:02:17.550> it<00:02:17.730> comes<00:02:17.940> to<00:02:18.120> take<00:02:18.300> down

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
takedowns and when it comes to take down

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.660 
takedowns and when it comes to take down
the<00:02:18.600> fence<00:02:18.810> you<00:02:19.380> want<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.650> be<00:02:19.770> fast<00:02:20.100> you<00:02:20.400> want

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
the fence you want to be fast you want

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.550 
the fence you want to be fast you want
