every<00:05:02.810> day<00:05:02.990> in<00:05:03.289> Russia<00:05:03.560> is<00:05:03.830> a<00:05:03.860> surprise<00:05:04.310> you

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
every day in Russia is a surprise you

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 
know there's this there's only like

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.560 
know there's this there's only like
there<00:05:07.310> are<00:05:07.400> certain<00:05:07.700> countries<00:05:07.880> that<00:05:08.300> you<00:05:08.390> can

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
there are certain countries that you can

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.730 
there are certain countries that you can
generalize<00:05:09.110> about<00:05:09.350> you<00:05:10.250> know<00:05:10.370> you<00:05:10.430> can<00:05:10.729> say<00:05:10.940> in

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
generalize about you know you can say in

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.120 
generalize about you know you can say in
Sweden<00:05:12.740> the<00:05:12.919> taxes<00:05:13.340> are<00:05:13.460> high<00:05:13.610> you<00:05:13.970> can<00:05:14.840> say<00:05:15.130> in

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
Sweden the taxes are high you can say in

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.330 
Sweden the taxes are high you can say in
Norway<00:05:16.550> the<00:05:16.729> people<00:05:17.030> are<00:05:17.120> very<00:05:17.270> modest<00:05:18.340> most

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
Norway the people are very modest most

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.379 
Norway the people are very modest most
countries<00:05:19.760> you<00:05:19.880> can<00:05:20.030> give<00:05:20.150> a<00:05:20.180> good

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:20.389 
countries you can give a good

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:24.010 
countries you can give a good
generalization<00:05:22.270> in<00:05:23.270> Russia<00:05:23.570> there's<00:05:23.840> only

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
generalization in Russia there's only

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.230 
generalization in Russia there's only
one<00:05:24.229> generalization<00:05:25.039> you<00:05:25.070> can<00:05:25.340> say<00:05:25.580> only<00:05:25.850> one

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
one generalization you can say only one

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.930 
one generalization you can say only one
and<00:05:26.530> that<00:05:27.530> is<00:05:27.680> you<00:05:28.070> can't<00:05:28.310> generalize<00:05:28.729> about

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
and that is you can't generalize about

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.350 
and that is you can't generalize about
Russia<00:05:29.320> that's<00:05:30.320> the<00:05:30.440> only<00:05:30.680> thing<00:05:30.860> you<00:05:30.950> can<00:05:31.100> say

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
Russia that's the only thing you can say

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.640 
Russia that's the only thing you can say
everything<00:05:32.360> here<00:05:32.720> is<00:05:32.870> a<00:05:32.900> contradiction

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
everything here is a contradiction

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.659 
everything here is a contradiction
so<00:05:34.400> every<00:05:34.700> day<00:05:35.740> even<00:05:36.740> your<00:05:36.860> most<00:05:37.039> standard

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669 
so every day even your most standard

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:39.640 
so every day even your most standard
routines<00:05:38.060> every<00:05:38.389> day<00:05:38.510> will<00:05:38.720> come<00:05:39.260> out<00:05:39.410> as<00:05:39.620> a

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
routines every day will come out as a

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.129 
routines every day will come out as a
surprise<00:05:40.360> sometimes<00:05:41.360> good<00:05:41.539> sometimes<00:05:41.570> bad

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:42.139 
surprise sometimes good sometimes bad

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:44.469 
surprise sometimes good sometimes bad
but<00:05:42.560> a<00:05:42.590> surprise<00:05:43.039> was<00:05:43.190> that<00:05:43.389> thank<00:05:44.389> you<00:05:44.419> very

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 
but a surprise was that thank you very

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:46.750 
but a surprise was that thank you very
much
