 gear<00:00:56.570> now<00:00:57.570> we<00:00:58.140> can<00:00:58.290> open<00:00:58.500> up<00:00:58.860> the

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
 gear now we can open up the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:06.260 
 gear now we can open up the
motor

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:19.999 

French<00:01:12.170> several<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.259> those<00:01:19.009> they're

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:31.759 

did<00:02:25.049> it<00:02:25.170> work<00:02:25.319> Oh<00:02:30.049> your<00:02:31.049> pry<00:02:31.230> there<00:02:31.470> around<00:02:31.620> the

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
did it work Oh your pry there around the

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:48.590

this<00:02:50.040> you're<00:02:51.040> staying<00:02:51.250> okay<00:02:57.150> so<00:02:58.150> here<00:02:58.569> is<00:02:58.630> in

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
this you're staying okay so here is in

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.740 
this you're staying okay so here is in
there<00:02:58.959> right<00:03:01.350> we<00:03:02.350> got<00:03:02.500> some<00:03:02.709> cleaning<00:03:02.950> to<00:03:03.069> do

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
there right we got some cleaning to do

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.080 
there right we got some cleaning to do
you<00:03:04.750> gotta<00:03:04.900> clean<00:03:05.140> off<00:03:05.320> all<00:03:05.650> this<00:03:06.459> stuff<00:03:06.790> here

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
you gotta clean off all this stuff here

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.960 
you gotta clean off all this stuff here
make<00:03:07.570> sure<00:03:07.720> there's<00:03:07.870> no<00:03:07.990> sand<00:03:08.550> okay<00:03:09.550> here's

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
make sure there's no sand okay here's

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.280 
make sure there's no sand okay here's
the<00:03:10.120> case<00:03:10.300> that<00:03:10.570> is<00:03:10.660> split

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
the case that is split

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.400 
the case that is split
there's<00:03:11.680> the<00:03:11.860> crank<00:03:12.280> there's<00:03:13.209> the<00:03:13.390> gears

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.180 

here's<00:03:17.410> the<00:03:17.560> reason<00:03:17.830> why<00:03:18.040> the<00:03:18.569> yfz<00:03:19.569> 450<00:03:20.560> can

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
here's the reason why the yfz 450 can

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.960 
here's the reason why the yfz 450 can
only<00:03:21.340> go<00:03:21.550> to<00:03:21.610> a<00:03:21.670> 4<00:03:22.030> plus<00:03:22.239> stroker<00:03:22.860> this

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
only go to a 4 plus stroker this

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.030 
only go to a 4 plus stroker this
aluminum<00:03:24.970> barrier<00:03:25.390> here<00:03:25.780> which<00:03:26.560> is<00:03:26.709> an<00:03:26.830> oil

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
aluminum barrier here which is an oil

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.470 
aluminum barrier here which is an oil
shield<00:03:27.660> it<00:03:28.660> actually<00:03:29.110> develops<00:03:29.860> a<00:03:30.100> draft<00:03:30.550> as

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
shield it actually develops a draft as

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.810 
shield it actually develops a draft as
the<00:03:31.690> piston<00:03:32.050> rotates<00:03:32.500> and<00:03:32.830> pushes

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
the piston rotates and pushes

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.759 
the piston rotates and pushes
high-pressure<00:03:34.360> air<00:03:34.720> into<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.410> crankcase

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
high-pressure air into the crankcase

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.520 
high-pressure air into the crankcase
blowing<00:03:36.459> the<00:03:36.550> oil<00:03:36.760> all<00:03:37.030> over<00:03:37.060> and<00:03:37.540> then<00:03:38.440> you

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
blowing the oil all over and then you

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.350 
blowing the oil all over and then you
get<00:03:38.650> a<00:03:38.709> return<00:03:39.100> on<00:03:39.160> the<00:03:39.400> bottom<00:03:39.790> of<00:03:39.970> the<00:03:40.060> tract

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
get a return on the bottom of the tract

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.790 
get a return on the bottom of the tract
here<00:03:40.750> so<00:03:41.350> you<00:03:41.440> get<00:03:41.560> and<00:03:41.860> the<00:03:42.550> oil<00:03:42.730> air<00:03:43.800> mixture

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
here so you get and the oil air mixture

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.210 
here so you get and the oil air mixture
movement<00:03:45.390> so<00:03:46.390> you<00:03:46.450> get<00:03:46.750> this<00:03:47.220> aluminum

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
movement so you get this aluminum

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:59.990 
movement so you get this aluminum
barrier<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:49.840> crank<00:03:52.049> has<00:03:53.049> recessed<00:03:54.510> flush

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.400 

with<00:04:00.510> a<00:04:00.540> crank<00:04:00.900> wait<00:04:01.140> it's<00:04:01.860> flush<00:04:02.220> here<00:04:03.410> when

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
with a crank wait it's flush here when

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.500 
with a crank wait it's flush here when
we<00:04:04.530> make<00:04:04.680> a<00:04:04.710> stroker<00:04:05.100> it<00:04:05.400> hangs<00:04:05.640> out<00:04:05.940> two

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
we make a stroker it hangs out two

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.650 
we make a stroker it hangs out two
millimeters<00:04:07.050> on<00:04:07.230> this<00:04:07.380> side<00:04:07.970> and<00:04:08.970> two

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
millimeters on this side and two

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.760 
millimeters on this side and two
millimeters<00:04:10.080> on<00:04:10.200> this<00:04:10.380> side<00:04:10.560> three

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
millimeters on this side three

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.210 
millimeters on this side three
millimeters<00:04:11.310> touches<00:04:12.410> so<00:04:13.410> you<00:04:13.470> can't<00:04:13.800> go<00:04:13.950> six
