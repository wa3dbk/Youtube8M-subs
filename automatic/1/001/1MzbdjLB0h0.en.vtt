00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
kept regenerating as you can see I'm

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.370 
kept regenerating as you can see I'm
using<00:00:57.140> the<00:00:57.500> kidneys<00:00:58.600> fangs<00:00:59.600> here<00:01:00.050> is<00:01:00.170> my

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:00.380 
using the kidneys fangs here is my

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.550 
using the kidneys fangs here is my
secondary<00:01:01.280> in<00:01:01.610> this<00:01:01.820> pretty<00:01:02.780> decent-size<00:01:03.350> is

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:03.560 
secondary in this pretty decent-size is

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.340 
secondary in this pretty decent-size is
my<00:01:03.710> primary<00:01:04.269> I'm<00:01:05.269> mostly<00:01:05.600> using<00:01:05.689> the<00:01:06.079> fangs

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
my primary I'm mostly using the fangs

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.789 
my primary I'm mostly using the fangs
however<00:01:07.659> as<00:01:08.659> you'll<00:01:08.840> see<00:01:09.020> as<00:01:09.140> the<00:01:09.290> video<00:01:09.530> goes

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
however as you'll see as the video goes

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.140 
however as you'll see as the video goes
along<00:01:11.470> I'm<00:01:12.470> relying<00:01:12.860> heavily<00:01:13.250> upon<00:01:13.670> the<00:01:13.880> fangs

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
along I'm relying heavily upon the fangs

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.870 
along I'm relying heavily upon the fangs
to<00:01:14.479> keep<00:01:14.659> my<00:01:14.840> health<00:01:15.049> up<00:01:15.350> I<00:01:15.619> usually<00:01:16.579> don't<00:01:16.700> get

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
to keep my health up I usually don't get

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.639 
to keep my health up I usually don't get
down<00:01:17.090> more<00:01:17.390> than<00:01:17.420> about<00:01:17.749> a<00:01:17.810> quarter<00:01:18.439> of<00:01:18.499> my

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
down more than about a quarter of my

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:21.190 
down more than about a quarter of my
health<00:01:18.890> and<00:01:19.280> then<00:01:19.999> I<00:01:20.090> also<00:01:20.240> have<00:01:20.539> some<00:01:20.810> health

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
health and then I also have some health

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.459 
health and then I also have some health
regeneration<00:01:21.770> gear<00:01:22.249> and<00:01:22.999> gear<00:01:23.390> that<00:01:23.600> gives<00:01:24.319> me

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:24.469 
regeneration gear and gear that gives me

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:29.109 
regeneration gear and gear that gives me
health<00:01:24.649> on<00:01:24.890> crits<00:01:25.249> so<00:01:27.369> faster<00:01:28.369> I<00:01:28.399> can<00:01:28.520> swing<00:01:28.909> my

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
health on crits so faster I can swing my

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.749 
health on crits so faster I can swing my
weapon<00:01:29.689> and<00:01:29.899> get<00:01:30.139> crits<00:01:30.499> the<00:01:30.829> higher<00:01:31.460> my

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
weapon and get crits the higher my

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.169 
weapon and get crits the higher my
health<00:01:32.060> health<00:01:32.749> stay<00:01:33.109> so<00:01:33.850> through<00:01:34.850> this<00:01:34.969> first

mistake I made the first couple go

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.719 
mistake I made the first couple go
through<00:01:51.499> is<00:01:51.560> hitting<00:01:51.950> him<00:01:52.069> anywhere<00:01:52.369> but<00:01:52.609> in

through is hitting him anywhere but in

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.419 
through is hitting him anywhere but in
that<00:01:52.880> mask<00:01:53.240> a<00:01:53.600> little<00:01:53.990> full<00:01:54.889> thing<00:01:55.189> that<00:01:55.310> he's

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:55.429 
that mask a little full thing that he's

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:57.160

wearing<00:01:55.639> over<00:01:55.999> his<00:01:56.119> face<00:01:56.420> there<00:01:56.749> you<00:01:56.990> got<00:01:57.139> to

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
wearing over his face there you got to

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.959 
wearing over his face there you got to
sit<00:01:57.439> there<00:01:57.649> and<00:01:57.770> hammer<00:01:57.979> on<00:01:58.249> that<00:01:58.279> every<00:01:58.759> time

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
sit there and hammer on that every time

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:02.969 
sit there and hammer on that every time
he<00:01:59.090> hits<00:01:59.299> the<00:01:59.479> ground<00:01:59.649> and<00:02:00.649> the<00:02:00.799> second<00:02:01.219> phase

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
he hits the ground and the second phase

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.359 
he hits the ground and the second phase
turn<00:02:03.979> into<00:02:04.189> like<00:02:04.340> a<00:02:04.369> pillar<00:02:04.729> of<00:02:04.850> you<00:02:05.630> know

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
turn into like a pillar of you know

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.380 
turn into like a pillar of you know
moving<00:02:07.369> light<00:02:07.639> and<00:02:07.999> you'll<00:02:08.740> spawn<00:02:09.740> a<00:02:09.770> bunch<00:02:10.099> of

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
moving light and you'll spawn a bunch of

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.949 
moving light and you'll spawn a bunch of
I<00:02:11.560> guess<00:02:12.560> ghosts<00:02:12.950> skeletons<00:02:13.340> basically<00:02:14.330> so

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
I guess ghosts skeletons basically so

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.470 
I guess ghosts skeletons basically so
you<00:02:15.020> have<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.410> deal<00:02:15.650> with<00:02:15.800> a<00:02:16.180> bunch<00:02:17.180> of<00:02:17.300> those

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
you have to deal with a bunch of those

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.809 
you have to deal with a bunch of those
as<00:02:18.080> you<00:02:18.230> can<00:02:18.410> see<00:02:18.620> my<00:02:18.830> health<00:02:19.010> isn't<00:02:19.400> moving<00:02:19.550> it

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
as you can see my health isn't moving it

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.180 
as you can see my health isn't moving it
I'll<00:02:20.570> link<00:02:21.050> through<00:02:21.350> a<00:02:21.410> lot<00:02:21.650> of<00:02:21.680> this<00:02:21.890> even

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
I'll link through a lot of this even

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.670 
I'll link through a lot of this even
though<00:02:22.310> I'm<00:02:22.370> getting<00:02:22.490> hit<00:02:22.760> a<00:02:22.790> little<00:02:23.090> bit

of the extra special attacks some of the
harvest<00:02:34.260> stuff<00:02:34.850> mostly<00:02:35.850> just<00:02:36.120> swinging<00:02:36.420> with

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
harvest stuff mostly just swinging with

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.890 
harvest stuff mostly just swinging with
what<00:02:39.480> they<00:02:39.660> put<00:02:39.990> the<00:02:40.110> fangs<00:02:40.410> there<00:02:40.709> though

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
what they put the fangs there though

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.900 
what they put the fangs there though
so<00:02:42.920> you<00:02:43.920> basically<00:02:44.070> kill<00:02:44.610> all<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:46.910> skeleton

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
so you basically kill all the skeleton

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.030 
so you basically kill all the skeleton
guys<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:48.540> then<00:02:48.630> he'll<00:02:48.870> basically<00:02:49.170> come<00:02:49.830> back

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
guys and then he'll basically come back

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.610 
guys and then he'll basically come back
down<00:02:50.370> into<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:51.120> pit<00:02:51.360> and<00:02:51.690> then<00:02:52.080> come<00:02:52.410> back<00:02:52.440> up

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
down into the pit and then come back up

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.810 
down into the pit and then come back up
so<00:02:53.040> you<00:02:53.130> can<00:02:53.420> you<00:02:54.420> can<00:02:54.600> beat<00:02:54.840> him<00:02:55.580> down<00:02:56.580> again

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.640 

fortunately<00:02:59.820> this<00:02:59.880> is<00:03:00.030> a<00:03:00.060> pretty<00:03:00.959> long<00:03:01.260> fight

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
fortunately this is a pretty long fight

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.500 
fortunately this is a pretty long fight
I<00:03:01.920> mean<00:03:01.980> I<00:03:02.190> think<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.430> entire<00:03:02.700> fight<00:03:03.060> lasted

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
I mean I think the entire fight lasted

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.880 
I mean I think the entire fight lasted
somewhere<00:03:03.870> between<00:03:04.080> seven<00:03:04.680> and<00:03:04.739> eight

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
somewhere between seven and eight

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.840 
somewhere between seven and eight
minutes<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:06.239> second<00:03:06.959> wave<00:03:07.140> after<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:08.250> deal

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
minutes the second wave after you deal

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.520 
minutes the second wave after you deal
with<00:03:09.030> these<00:03:09.180> skeletons<00:03:09.750> they'll<00:03:10.080> basically

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
with these skeletons they'll basically

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.490 
with these skeletons they'll basically
spawn<00:03:11.250> while<00:03:11.550> he's<00:03:12.420> trying<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:12.900> smash<00:03:13.200> your

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
spawn while he's trying to smash your

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.160 
spawn while he's trying to smash your
flat<00:03:13.800> with<00:03:14.040> his<00:03:14.190> arms<00:03:14.720> it's<00:03:15.720> basically<00:03:16.020> the

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
flat with his arms it's basically the

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.660 
flat with his arms it's basically the
same<00:03:16.350> thing<00:03:16.410> deal<00:03:16.830> with<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.040> skeletons<00:03:17.520> as

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
same thing deal with the skeletons as

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.199 
same thing deal with the skeletons as
you<00:03:17.790> need<00:03:18.000> to<00:03:19.190> beat<00:03:20.190> them<00:03:20.370> up<00:03:20.400> for<00:03:20.760> crits<00:03:21.030> in

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
you need to beat them up for crits in

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.760 
you need to beat them up for crits in
life<00:03:21.420> if<00:03:21.660> you<00:03:21.690> use<00:03:21.930> them<00:03:23.360> using<00:03:24.360> the<00:03:24.480> fangs<00:03:24.770> and

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
life if you use them using the fangs and

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.570 
life if you use them using the fangs and

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.830 

wailing<00:05:33.240> soul<00:05:33.570> basically<00:05:34.200> pops<00:05:34.470> back<00:05:34.770> up<00:05:35.840> and

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
wailing soul basically pops back up and

now it's all about hitting them in the

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.480 
now it's all about hitting them in the
pink<00:05:38.430> face<00:05:38.760> avoiding<00:05:39.479> his<00:05:39.780> tentacles<00:05:40.320> can<00:05:41.070> I

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
pink face avoiding his tentacles can I

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.760 
pink face avoiding his tentacles can I
really<00:05:41.820> just<00:05:42.000> went<00:05:42.750> for<00:05:42.900> the<00:05:43.020> frontal<00:05:43.380> assault

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
really just went for the frontal assault

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.280 
really just went for the frontal assault
took<00:05:44.070> the<00:05:44.190> damage<00:05:44.430> and<00:05:44.970> regenerated<00:05:45.810> it<00:05:45.930> as<00:05:46.140> I

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
took the damage and regenerated it as I

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.010 
took the damage and regenerated it as I
was<00:05:46.440> killing<00:05:46.830> things<00:05:47.100> I<00:05:47.600> guess<00:05:48.600> it's<00:05:48.780> kind<00:05:48.990> of

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
was killing things I guess it's kind of

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:54.710 
was killing things I guess it's kind of
a<00:05:49.169> brute<00:05:49.410> force<00:05:49.440> way<00:05:49.919> to<00:05:49.979> do<00:05:50.250> it<00:05:50.430> but<00:05:53.419> it's<00:05:54.419> the

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 
a brute force way to do it but it's the

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.830 
a brute force way to do it but it's the
way<00:05:54.840> that<00:05:55.020> worked<00:05:55.200> for<00:05:55.380> me<00:05:56.150> it<00:05:57.150> could<00:05:57.360> be<00:05:57.390> very

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
way that worked for me it could be very

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.520 
way that worked for me it could be very
well<00:05:59.330> combination<00:06:00.330> of<00:06:00.479> the<00:06:00.660> kidneys<00:06:01.260> fangs

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
well combination of the kidneys fangs

well combination of the kidneys fangs
and<00:06:01.830> some<00:06:02.039> of<00:06:02.130> the<00:06:02.220> gear<00:06:02.460> I<00:06:02.490> was<00:06:03.030> using<00:06:04.460> so
