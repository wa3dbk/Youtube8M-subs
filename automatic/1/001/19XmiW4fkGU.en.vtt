you<00:05:06.700> know<00:05:06.820> power<00:05:07.120> grid<00:05:07.420> so<00:05:07.690> I<00:05:08.440> think<00:05:08.560> that

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:08.920 
you know power grid so I think that

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.530 
you know power grid so I think that

that<00:05:11.410> would<00:05:12.280> better<00:05:12.490> quantify<00:05:12.910> the<00:05:13.750> model<00:05:14.080> is

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
that would better quantify the model is

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.240 
that would better quantify the model is
very<00:05:14.710> important

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
very important
