00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.919
 Hello everyone 

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:12.839
 It is called Shinshu Nakano January 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:15.549
 Nice to meet you 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:16.949
 Today to everyone 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.769
 What was the deterioration of Shinshu 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:23.500
 Talk about what to learn again 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:25.989
 Let me do it 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:27.839
 If you ask Shinshu 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:30.609
 Most people think of sectarian names 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:32.160
 I think 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.580
 But originally 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.050
 When I use Shinshu when I get tired 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.480
 Makoto chest 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.660
 It means really important things for human beings 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.460
 We will clarify the really important things 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.540
 It's just Shinshu Nakano 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.590
 I always live with a certainty 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.720
 But he sent me that it was true 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.630
 That is the word Shinshu 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.750
 For example, I think some people are proud of what they can imagine 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.970
 That's a very good thing 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.750
 But what if I can not play sports 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.080
 Will 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.070
 Such body is not my body 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.970
 I can not live if I can not play sports 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.970
 It may not be to bother you 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.120
 It is a temporary source but a true basis 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.930
 I can not read 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.220
 A base that never changes under any circumstances 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.230
 The diagnosis was called Shinshu 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.560
 So what's really important to me 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.260
 27 days a day 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.840
 Ask this together 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.270
 That's all about Shinshu 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.770
 middle 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.850
 The words I wrote are certainly 800 years old from now 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.650
 So it may be difficult for you 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.930
 But my relative 800 years ago was a modern person 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.320
 I met when I thought about how to live in that time 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.679
 Through the words of that person we too 

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:14.039
 In the present age 

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:17.469
 I want to think about how to live and how to live 

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:19.459
 is 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.429
 When in 12th grade 

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:23.839
 To get words in 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:27.489
 We have you shake to high temperature and executive 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.349
 And if you can read the words of relatives 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.689
 In addition, I asked the words of China, India, and Buddha. 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:37.459
 Come 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.739
 Based on that, in the third grade and fourth grade 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:44.269
 Organize your thoughts 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.269
 That is the breed is quite at home 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:51.159
 In the form of graduation thesis at the end of the fourth grader 

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:54.249
 How did you take it 

00:02:54.249 --> 00:02:57.900
 If you think about it, I will summarize this 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:00.639
 With you all 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:04.539
 I look forward to learning with this poem concentration
