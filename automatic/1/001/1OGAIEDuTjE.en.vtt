00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.200 

chera<00:00:33.129> hollow

4000<00:00:38.200> feet

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.980 

on<00:00:41.000> our<00:00:41.240> earth

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:46.990 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.500 

is<00:00:47.500> that<00:00:47.740> these<00:00:47.890> big<00:00:48.160> roads<00:00:48.430> will<00:00:48.730> teach<00:00:48.940> you<00:00:49.180> a

is that these big roads will teach you a

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.270 
is that these big roads will teach you a
lot<00:00:50.440> about<00:00:51.210> speed<00:00:52.210> and

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
lot about speed and

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.720 
lot about speed and
and<00:00:53.399> then<00:00:53.579> your<00:00:53.699> bike<00:00:53.879> down

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.510 

this<00:00:56.970> year<00:00:57.329> but<00:00:57.540> any<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:58.380> buy<00:00:58.590> when<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.280> break

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
this year but any you buy when you break

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.299 
this year but any you buy when you break
down<00:01:00.090> hill<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.809> it's<00:01:00.989> not<00:01:01.230> different<00:01:01.470> great

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
down hill and it's not different great

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.880 
down hill and it's not different great
you<00:01:03.150> have<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.510> negotiate<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.290> same<00:01:04.530> curve

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
you have to negotiate the same curve

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.370 
you have to negotiate the same curve
going<00:01:05.220> uphill

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
going uphill

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.859 
going uphill
all<00:01:07.920> sets<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.430> frame<00:01:08.700> because<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.390> force<00:01:09.659> is

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
all sets the frame because the force is

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.170 
all sets the frame because the force is
pushing<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.350> down<00:01:10.500> here

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.380 

as<00:01:13.720> much<00:01:13.960> because<00:01:14.290> you<00:01:14.710> have<00:01:14.890> the<00:01:15.390> hill

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
as much because you have the hill

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.000 
as much because you have the hill
helping<00:01:16.900> you<00:01:17.050> out<00:01:17.110> and<00:01:19.320> pushing<00:01:20.320> you<00:01:20.560> faster

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
helping you out and pushing you faster

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.100 
helping you out and pushing you faster
and<00:01:21.130> faster<00:01:21.310> and<00:01:21.670> that<00:01:21.820> can<00:01:22.000> be<00:01:22.030> a<00:01:22.480> good<00:01:23.320> day

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
and faster and that can be a good day

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.430 
and faster and that can be a good day
that<00:01:25.260> can<00:01:25.410> be<00:01:25.440> very<00:01:25.530> treacherous<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.490> your<00:01:26.850> not

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.820 

so

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.220 

this<00:01:35.340> early

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179 
not pushing it hard but with these her

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:02.880 
not pushing it hard but with these her
sharp<00:02:01.509> curves<00:02:01.810> there's<00:02:02.109> a<00:02:02.170> lot<00:02:02.320> of<00:02:02.350> traffic<00:02:02.649> on

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
sharp curves there's a lot of traffic on

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.030 
sharp curves there's a lot of traffic on
this<00:02:03.069> road

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
this road

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.400
