some<00:01:50.729> charging<00:01:51.180> problems<00:01:51.570> by<00:01:51.720> replace<00:01:52.110> the

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
some charging problems by replace the

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.460 
some charging problems by replace the

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
I haven't even needed a battery tender

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:26.450 
pulled it out even if it's been a week
or<00:03:17.860> so

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.340 

you<00:03:27.000> can<00:03:27.120> get<00:03:27.240> going<00:03:27.450> pretty<00:03:27.660> fast<00:03:27.960> that's

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
you can get going pretty fast that's

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:38.040 
you can get going pretty fast that's
obviously<00:03:28.920> not<00:03:29.130> for<00:03:29.490> bike

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.790 

the<00:03:38.620> front<00:03:38.950> brake<00:03:39.190> pads<00:03:39.490> of<00:03:39.730> bird<00:03:39.970> how<00:03:40.210> about

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
the front brake pads of bird how about

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.890 
the front brake pads of bird how about
50%<00:03:41.800> life<00:03:42.100> on<00:03:42.430> them

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
50% life on them

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.960 
50% life on them
I<00:03:43.930> could<00:03:44.440> San<00:03:44.680> be<00:03:44.860> replaced<00:03:45.190> and<00:03:45.400> believe<00:03:45.670> they

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
I could San be replaced and believe they

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.630 
I could San be replaced and believe they
are<00:03:46.030> the<00:03:46.150> original<00:03:46.270> ones<00:03:46.660> from<00:03:47.460> 1997<00:03:48.460> so

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
are the original ones from 1997 so

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.390 
are the original ones from 1997 so
they're<00:03:48.790> probably<00:03:48.940> kind<00:03:49.270> of<00:03:49.300> old<00:03:50.130> the<00:03:51.130> back

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
they're probably kind of old the back

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.780 
they're probably kind of old the back
ones<00:03:52.110> I<00:03:53.110> can't<00:03:53.860> remember<00:03:53.920> I<00:03:54.280> think<00:03:54.520> we<00:03:54.580> have

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
ones I can't remember I think we have
