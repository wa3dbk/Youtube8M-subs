00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:10.860
 we did a little workout for at 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.139
 simulate a small pour and then we have 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.750
 buried that case so is the dog to 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.070
 work then capped his research and 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.070
 then find there the victim 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.239
 we have dogs that are trained for the 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.120
 avalanche research then the interest 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.360
 is that the dog is a very 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.519
 fast since at active offensive level 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.559
 at the level of the authors he will go see 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:01.949
 year much more developed than we 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.570
 and so he will find very quickly wars 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.610
 generally also everything goes well in 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.850
 4 5 minutes on a dog casting goes 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.350
 will find the person 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.690
 the avalanche that needed very quickly 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.179
 fast it means that statistically 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:19.500
 it's a person and buried 

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:20.729
 for about a quarter of an hour 97 95% 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.070
 chances to survive 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.509
 about one meter of snow at the end 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.009
 half an hour we are already 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:31.979
 50% and very quickly its decline then 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.450
 that's Czech Statistical trackers 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.569
 every rescuer who arrives on a 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.679
 avalanche in have well in mind this 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:39.720
 statistic goes very quickly the fourth 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:41.130
 quarter of an hour it exists 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.720
 unfortunately, but it does not prevent 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.280
 special cases and the avalanche 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.909
 against is that day it's a case 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.310
 particular 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.429
 and as long as the person is not cleared 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.810
 and she is not declared dead 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:53.810
 for us she is free
