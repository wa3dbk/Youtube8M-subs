00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.380
 the tire contains air but this air 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.790
 constantly seeking to go outside and little 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.000
 little by little he descends the pressure in 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.760
 tire falls that entails 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.530
 certain consequences 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.740
 since the shape of the tire family is distorted under 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.760
 load the tire heats up more 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.110
 wear much faster 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.740
 control accuracy deteriorates 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.519
 fuel consumption is growing 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.319
 at best, it may lead to 

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:26.710
 loss of traffic management 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.710
 means and tires can burst 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:32.940
 it is therefore very important to check regularly 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.190
 tire pressure 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.070
 however, this operation requires some 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.150
 explanations 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.790
 actually required values 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.250
 tire pressures for different types of cars 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.320
 usually given for cold tires what 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.570
 such a cold tire this tire which is not 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.410
 moved at least for two 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.850
 last hours 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.810
 the tire heats up quickly for example 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.570
 after three kilometers of mezin ride 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.250
 by the city 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.390
 Minsk it means that in most 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.500
 Cases during pressure check 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.580
 the tire will be the hot capital in this case 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.200
 it is considered normal that the pressure which 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.420
 increases with increase 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.000
 temperature will be higher than set for 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.510
 cold tires more precisely the pressure is 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.240
 the solution must exceed the pressure 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.710
 cold at 4 pounds per square inch or 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.340
 hope three tenths of the atmosphere 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.080
 if it is wrong to hold 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.950
 pressure is normal for an example let's take a tire 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.850
 cold with recommended 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.200
 the pressure of two apartments after 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.300
 trips tire heated by imams this 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.790
 shows pressure of about two point 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.060
 one-tenth of the atmosphere though it 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.890
 pressure higher recommend rest 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.670
 still burst noise can 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.330
 let the part about two 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.080
 tenths of the atmosphere that is to reach 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.780
 normal rate for burning 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.360
 tires in 2008 three tenths of the atmosphere that 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.300
 same to do if the gauges more than 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.030
 two point three atmospheres when 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.340
 apply the golden rule never 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.840
 put the hot tires down in others 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.630
 circumstances may be required 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.620
 pressure more than recommended 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.400
 for example two tenths of the atmosphere 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.940
 more if you plan to publish 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.189
 now and for more than two hours 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:10.639
 or 3 4 tenths more cases 

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:14.290
 use trailers or else 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.069
 more if it is recommended 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.499
 manufacturer 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:19.939
 as you can see tire pressure requires special 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:23.059
 attention 

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:25.219
 pressure must be checked at least 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:26.679
 once a month they are systematically 

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:30.159
 advanced travel do not forget 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:32.839
 screw the caps back for a week and 

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:35.009
 something else do not forget to check 

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:36.010
 spare tire pressure
