 I am anxious street thiers by 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.960
 moments there is something wrong there 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.960

 three currencies - snow-white and there 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.299
 I snapped my fingers and I did 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.280
 to appear this guy 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.770
 no it's not you who made me 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.119
 to appear his I'm conscious but 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.070
 what do you know about it you are my 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.659
 creation made us appear from nothingness 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.119
 ch it's still better than you I 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.249
 traveled it turns out I'm 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.969
 appeared under your nose when you 

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:36.590
 snap your fingers 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:36.590
 but I repeat it is a coincidence 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:44.179
 you are told I am a god outright 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.469
 a god who was made without anyone 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:46.670
 to make me laugh but you're not going 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:48.079
 fall into the panel he takes himself for 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.439
 a god just because he appeared from 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:49.850
 nowhere 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.709
 so he believes that the help of the powers 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.530
 all this but no it's just me that with 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:56.119
 the bar be yes besides you you 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.030

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.829
 make teams appear 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.969
 I'm a god I'm not just a 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:05.840
 type yeah no but I did not do it on purpose 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:08.200

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.329
 in gis raf 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.349
 apparently I messed up my metamorphosis 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:20.090
 why do you want to transform about 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:21.920

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.260

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.160
 person huh you prefer to leave him 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.290
 on the floor and talk about giraffes or 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.870
 so he's a spy of a kingdom 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.799
 enemies times it gets heavy 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.890
 why did you bring up a 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:37.400
 spy and it's not him who made me 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.620
 appear 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.269
 I was traveling he snapped his fingers and 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.670

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.260

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.750
 it's lucky that I do yoga 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:24.770

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.840

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.270

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.180
 Giraffe transport 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.180
 but on the other hand I can disintegrate you 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.510
 suddenly the thesis of hope in force 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.760
 he does not aim to be able to 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.459

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.959

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.100
 in front - door to drink and to eat even 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.660
 time if you teleported the 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.190
 road did not take place very grueling but 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.780
 that's not the question it's the principle 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.430

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.250

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:38.120
 when she pissed off you came why 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.390
 by the way 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:45.170

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:48.050
 displeased there by cons if he says the 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:49.610
 truth is tense because the gods 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.070
 disgruntled it's cool to manage anyway 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.570
 you surprise me you're on the verge of 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.850
 curse of divine wrath and I 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.340
 happening and without the support of the gods more than 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.410
 power for the magi a real thing 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.980
 a mage who can not turn 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:05.690

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:08.660

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.640

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.080
 inventing a painful song 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.730

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.870

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.690

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.010
