00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.210
 What's happening, good kids, it's concluded 

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:07.100
 an experiment that I have been doing since 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.010
 about a month ago maybe it 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.110
 month and a half that shows how long it took the 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.360
 coral algae expanding into a rock 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.390
 totally virgin but virgin virgin 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.770
 this one that was outside and is precisely 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.820
 this rock from here it seems that the 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.820
 fish know that the way of the sea 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.930
 it was completely white to see the 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.989
 previous videos we will take advantage of 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.279
 zoom in as they are left to wash vale 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:34.280
 As you can see, it already has high nuclei with 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.890
 purple alina red color of 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.320
 green color this rock can already be given 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:43.160
 As a living rock, it takes approximately 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.140
 a month and it takes a month that really 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.460
 interesting was without having contact or 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.980
 that is, not supporting it, because everything is 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.320
 this rock as you see in the coral here 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.600
 the truth is that it is done very well by the 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.149
 additives I ask to throw it then separately 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.469
 the temperature and for something quite 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.930
 important that are the changes of 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.269
 salinity within a range you can 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.039
 make some very big changes because 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.869
 you have fish but for them to expand 

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:11.660
 in the coral area you have to do 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:14.740
 Exit changes just like right now 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.179
 I'm doing periods of light 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.650
 there's going to be about two 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:23.140
 Weeks a 50% light drop 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.150
 coinciding with the full moon the reason 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.280
 it's quite simple is that I want to do 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.580
 the reproduction of the corals of a 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.160
 sexual way with the gametes see how 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.350
 they fertilize see how they alight on 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.790
 certain areas and see how by 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.970
 example you can get to leave a 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.820
 Colostrum from scratch is not complained about 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.200
 any area of ​​the coral that's what 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.820
 really interesting in an aquarium 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.970
 marine he is complained let's say he's from 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.200
 an artificial way and the most complex 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.580
 of a marine aquarium is the reproduction 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.840
 sexual activity of the corals for that 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.750
 you need to have a lot of knowledge 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.220
 because they live, you need to control 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:05.070
 salinity see the lunar cycles 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.350
 and above all to know what kind of light to put 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.630
 I have removed the blue and I have removed the 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.870
 of 10000 Kelvin and leaves only the technique 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.750
 of one of 10000 kelvin I will not leave then 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.510
 that for two weeks to provoke the 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.870
 reproduction I have also taken the 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.550
 I've lowered the temperature a lot 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.160
 I was is now about 23 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.260
 degrees 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.470
 and then also 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.780
 within 34 days for the pumps and 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.640
 within 34 days later it will return to 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.520
 put an extra pump at maximum power 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.319
 simply to recreate then the time of 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.069
 reproduction of the corals that usually 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.959
 always be on a full moon 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.549
 well done this also because here 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.920
 they talk about the corals of the bases we 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.780
 account when it says the forest this 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.060
 you said that the bases stayed 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.560
 very ugly gum color are already 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.300
 totally with the coral mouth if you 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.099
 dais account it seems that it is born directly 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.910
 of the stone this is a very stone 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.010
 pretty 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.370
 same as these corals because if you give 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.349
 account and the bases are not seen 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.110
 Here I can show you an example of 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.730
 how he started playing the 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.890
 plants that is the easiest thing in a way 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.860
 natural 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.390
 we go around here this I put them or 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.069
 this is not a natural reproduction but 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.490
 here there is a natural reproduction of 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.490
 faults 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.580
 there you can see with the action saints of 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.370
 the nothing 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.780
 and that is a natural reproduction 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.160
 complaint engines 2 complained then we have it 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.410
 here and take advantage of it taught us 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.570
 materials that go well this would be a 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.940
 forced reproduction that is cutting the 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.640
 head and then they started to come out more 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.830
 heads but a natural reproduction 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:47.100
 there we have a clear example that 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.680
 visa and that fluff of there accordros 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.910
 which is the lawn from when he was here 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.290
 the effect you asked me why 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.740
 has taken him from the wall of being to 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.750
 marin we go there 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.120
 taking advantage of the fact that I have the house arranged 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.770
 and of no problem already with the 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.440
 transfer and everything as you can see everything is very 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.790
 organized 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.790
 the grass that we have here 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.500
 and you asked me why did you 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.810
 removed to the wall does not really 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.819
 removes from the wall on the wall still 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.910
 damage that has stained and appears 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:18.709
 the gum that's from there is grass I 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.900
 I put with the stone and as has already been 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.510
 expanded by the wall because we're going to 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.970
 leave that core of grass so that it 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.800
 distribute all over the wall and then already 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.570
 because the major nucleus we have left 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.860
 here then nothing to leave 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.860
 also repopulating the senate 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:36.860
 As you can see, it is beautiful to be yellow 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.900
 true that is 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:44.030
 Well, if someone does not know it too 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:45.289
 the skimmer I already put the tech3 pintos I made 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.050
 a fix back here with the 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:49.729
 filler with everything and that's why now 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.069
 same as if you realize everything looks 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:54.729
 rather better and there is the same lie 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:57.099
 the amount of coral is very large 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:59.310
 here you can also see since the line 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:01.320
 well, it has made its effect 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.990
 the truth that brought me a good boss of 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.180
 coral and noticed how good are 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:09.590
 making a 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:11.770
 what is a soma disc called 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.289
 I was not there before 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.319
 that is new 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:19.430
 Well here you have it green is 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:20.980
 precious process 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.510
 Well, I hope you liked it 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.950
 then the mini experiment of the living rock 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.960
 that I already told you that I was going to do it 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:30.020
 It takes about a month and a half one 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:34.420
 thing like that in passing a dead rock of 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.420
 rock alive so nothing guys a greeting
