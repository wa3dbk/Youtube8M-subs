00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
okay I guess that is not good that B has

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:29.460 
okay I guess that is not good that B has
a<00:03:08.470> high<00:03:08.680> opinion<00:03:08.799> of<00:03:09.220> me<00:03:09.390> okay<00:03:28.290> this<00:03:29.290> is<00:03:29.440> a

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
class selection mechanics I guess that's

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:55.890
