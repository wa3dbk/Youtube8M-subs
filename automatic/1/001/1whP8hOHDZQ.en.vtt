 two diplomas of higher education 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.480

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:46.110

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:51.480

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.650
 I had exactly the same hairstyle clean 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.909

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.670
 know something freaked out went to 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.540

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.090

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:18.439
 can so moment to goal to the feet why not 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.439
 said and student 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:28.259
 you washed the car and the groups so I 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:31.189
 haircut today but still you are now 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.189
 no money to wash 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.930
 general father is an amazing person recently 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.030
 I approach him say sushi published 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.590
 long time with my mother went to the country can we 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.840
 there we will go with friends beer we will drink 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.330
 let's sit did a serious face looked 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.690
 on my son just says maybe 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:56.260
 better to go to church and all the more 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.960
 Now the post is so correct that all 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:02.770
 is in an instant from bati to papa 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.600
 turned for me no expectations it would be 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.000
 if he said smog could be better in 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.410
 mosque go 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.970
 it seems to me if my father would have been taken 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.520
 captive Germans it would look like this 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.330
 nations so now we lead the rear to 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:20.400
 Russian, and there we all shoot well 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:23.860
 better balcony can sort the flag of the court 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.190
 there are already quite passable and the seedlings 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.180
 nowhere to put 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.250
 wash out of some amazing 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.990
 they come up with their own quality 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.600
 classification for example such a quality 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.670
 how pseudo aestheticism will explain now 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.760
 pseudo aesthetics is when me and dad 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.610
 in the country we make a drain from plastic 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.950
 pipe wire and electrical tape and it does not burn 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:49.330
 something tape did not cut ugly 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:51.250
 ugly what beautiful can 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.000
 look like something out of plastic tape 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.000
 wire bottles 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.550
 beauty in similar structures can 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.790
 find only my dad and archa oral 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:07.270
 contemporary artist i see in this 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.340
 compositions rebellious spirit of early works 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.470
 andy warhol 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:19.750
 In general from this drain I simply not 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:21.370
 noticed that the tape is not cut off and how 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.870
 I would not argue my father is impossible 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.880
 persuade especially during all time 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.150
 support his school friends 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.600
 the creator of the program while everyone is at home 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:34.000
 heading modern pens respectively 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.989
 my dad barely curses but 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.140
 at least in humans 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.760
 whether it's TV these are sitting like that 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.000
 hear mate think about 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:46.390
 8-hour news is exactly at all if 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.190
 my father was a militant consultant 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.709
 Hollywood they would not have lasted longer 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.760
 20 minutes well, that they would not gazelle 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.620
 caught up bv 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.049
 yes how many platoons does it have 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.019
 a pistol and would give would not survive after that 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:01.299
 fired seriously my father 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.680
 broke only once when came to 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:07.359
 him for help in composing 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:10.060
 why do we love our country know father 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:11.350
 was just unemployed and time 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.680
 speculate on this subject he had 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.320
 plenty they sort of responded after 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.579
 what I specified is not 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.190
 a tautology of so many 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.640
 cognates in the sentence each friend 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.640
 a friend 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.690
 to which he answered me with several more 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.030
 tautology my so say root root 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.190
 chased the essence left alone 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.330
 I know without it was hard in 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.819
 school because guys me now 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.889
 understand the worst when on 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:42.220
 physical education team in order to choose 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:45.550
 last there is such a chosen me 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:48.069
 the last one is a pancake even worse these 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.289
 you think I have not the last but I 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:53.740
 realist and understand that the competition between 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:56.289
 lahami communicate dubious achievement 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:05:00.719
 once the name sounds after the phrase yes poher 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:04.150
 let's poher let's viburnum 

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:06.639
 but that even more soup gave birth to me in 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.379
 school this school cook knife such 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:12.190
 feeling that they were not taken to work 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:14.310
 by weight only in case 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.469
 suddenly she will forget the bun shape 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:22.330
 He looked at his colleague when everyone gave 

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:24.860
 saw ready oven nikolay tishchenko 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.860
 thank 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.860
 but 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:34.150
 these wall is the man who most 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:38.190
 your friends girls phone book 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.190
 recorded as never to lift
