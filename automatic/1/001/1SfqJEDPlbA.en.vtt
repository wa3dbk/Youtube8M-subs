00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:31.310
 little hay salt and we'll turn 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.310

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.630
 white pepper 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.390
 this can only be on one side so as not to 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:47.340
 to spice up a lot of people will come 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.750
 beer that will give a taste here and 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.549

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.500
 the lemon cookie we'll use the 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:01.619
 then we can put the zest 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:03.659
 first always at the time of shaving not 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.119
 let arrive in the white part 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:11.270
 lemon white is the bitter part then 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.270
 shave only the yellow and it's turning 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.780
 so that it really tastes 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:25.170
 sour but not bitter and can also 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:29.950
 be on one side only 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:32.340
 and then we 'll squeeze the juice from the 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.510
 Lemon I'm Using Sicilian Lemon 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.489
 because it has a distinct taste it 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.730
 It is a little softer than usual lemon 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:43.269
 but I can and lemon clove can be lemon 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:46.379

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:53.440
 after the lemon 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:58.750
 We come with an Englishman who will give 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:04.180
 a taste of meat spices to 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:06.989
 parsley and chives pretty much a pot 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.989
 like this 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:18.400
 the potato we will slice 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:19.329
 thick and goes around the 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.139
 beef 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:24.879
 finally we will squeeze three 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:28.480
 garlic cloves 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:33.459
 we will crush to release flavor 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:35.739
 put over the meat is to use 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.530
 foil in the first ten minutes 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:41.590
 cooking and then we retire 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.739
 for the next twenty minutes of 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.739
 cooking 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:58.269
 we cover the aluminum is not a 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:02.230
 direitinha if they are not holes and he 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:07.840
 goes to the oven at 200 degrees for 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.840
 approximately 30 minutes 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:19.790
 ten minutes with aluminum and then the 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:21.590
 rest without then in 20 minutes to half 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.990
 we 'll have dinner at the most 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.530
 for at least four people 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.530
 ready 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.430
 It's been 15 minutes now. 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:40.520
 will take a look at our flesh 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:47.990
 to see if you can get the domain already 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:52.250
 It's scent you can take it, you know. 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:55.280
 taste and now it will last 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:05:00.950
 also the soft potato is already taking 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:04.060
 a beautiful meat in the oven at 200 degrees and 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.060
 so continue 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:11.030
 and I believe that in more who knows not 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:16.180
 be ready now our flesh is 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:20.919
 ready and we 'll get it out of the oven 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.919
 Our smell is really very good. 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:31.560
 potato is already looking wrong 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:35.099
 the meat is well roasted and here the people 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:38.990
 already has a full meal can beat 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:43.500
 the meat right here 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:48.150
 usually thin slices and we will go 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:50.699
 make a super decoration this dish if 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:54.180
 want to drop a little more pink 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:56.340
 You can take it about ten minutes before 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:59.280
 is a cooking time is even more 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.090
 fast now is to do the decoration of the 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.460
 dish 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.470
 I always leave in the refrigerator a 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.970
 container like this with vinegar 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.070
 reduced balsamic and a little bit of 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.509
 Sometimes wine came from the port but 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.520
 It's always cool for you to play 

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:13.710
 I got home and did not have to have the 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:20.340
 work to do that so we 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:23.360
 can make a beautiful decoration and a 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:26.849
 dinner that was super fast 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.699
 it looks like it was a great dish 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:33.449
 elaborate 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:36.289
 Now we'll get the meat. 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:36.289
 the three slices 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:45.419
 I usually use three slices per dish 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:47.880
 but if you want it to be better 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:54.380
 served no problem 

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:54.380
 the potato that is already super golden 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:03.400
 I always have my home some 

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:05.590
 had something then this time the 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:08.169
 basil I usually vary with rosemary 

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:09.550
 With salvio, you only have to buy 

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:13.690
 plant and can leave inside a 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:14.650
 mug that gets thing including of 

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:17.290

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:20.889
 so we're going to put a blue whiting 

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:24.490
