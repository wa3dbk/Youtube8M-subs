00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:23.190 
through the winter is definitely a step
forward<00:07:18.450> it's<00:07:19.450> a<00:07:21.180> justice<00:07:22.180> engine<00:07:22.570> problem

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:23.200 
forward it's a justice engine problem

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.680 
forward it's a justice engine problem
this<00:07:23.620> is<00:07:23.800> a<00:07:23.830> new<00:07:24.040> problem<00:07:24.250> and<00:07:24.640> we've<00:07:25.450> got<00:07:25.600> to

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:25.690 
this is a new problem and we've got to

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:27.450 
this is a new problem and we've got to
find<00:07:25.840> out<00:07:25.960> what's<00:07:26.140> caused<00:07:26.440> it<00:07:26.680> and<00:07:26.800> there's

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:27.460 
find out what's caused it and there's

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.220 
find out what's caused it and there's
clock's<00:07:27.670> ticking<00:07:28.030> in<00:07:28.150> the<00:07:28.210> run-up<00:07:28.390> in<00:07:28.510> to<00:07:29.020> the

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:29.230 
clock's ticking in the run-up in to the

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:31.140 
clock's ticking in the run-up in to the
24<00:07:29.620> hours<00:07:29.800> at<00:07:29.980> the<00:07:30.070> wall<00:07:30.190> so<00:07:30.820> we've<00:07:30.970> got<00:07:31.120> a

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:31.150 
24 hours at the wall so we've got a

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.690 
24 hours at the wall so we've got a
final<00:07:31.360> answer
