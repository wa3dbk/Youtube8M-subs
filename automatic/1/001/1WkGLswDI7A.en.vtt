00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.400
 a lot of people asking for video over land. 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.410

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.769
 people are only depending on the time 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.450
 people who play on our team that they 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.470
 They will participate with us

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.840
 in another video that has a lot of people 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.369
 asking is bill of package the beque is that 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:32.700
 video who will do is ask

 understand the first April better 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.840
 simple you will make the position of 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.260
 exit the ball and will walk back up 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.260
 the harbor 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.300
 Once you get to where you're going to 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:51.870
 ball would run with it and go walking 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:53.909
 up time until next year and so 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.289
 successively I put six things 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:57.289
 so you're going to go back 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.420
 crises and ran towards the two 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.680
 the last time you launch the 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.680
 circuit everything stays this way 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.030
 O 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.750
 on Monday saw us going to use the stairs 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.490
 high is good you ask the help of 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.600
 Someone you're going to need somebody 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.640
 that it is talking about the things you 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.050
 Open if you're not okay, you? 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.520
 out of your head but you can call them 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.200
 What's friend anyone have 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.590
 trained with you for this video 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.960
 ticket will attract that shit they take 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.050
 5 when the person speaks to you front 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:03.180
 you will bypass the statement taken 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:04.830
 end of her speech, you're going to go through 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.200
 top 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:12.390
 if she talks behind you will get around 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:15.420
 per drive and so on a 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:21.200
 idea of a return with the time you go 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.200
 to the ball in the street 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:31.180

 right 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.490

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.490
 right 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.200
