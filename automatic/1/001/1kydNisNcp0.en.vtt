why<00:03:52.460> did<00:03:52.580> was<00:03:52.700> Ross<00:03:52.850> killed<00:03:53.090> right<00:03:53.240> now<00:03:53.290> one

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
why did was Ross killed right now one

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.660 
why did was Ross killed right now one
turned<00:03:54.470> too<00:03:54.590> late<00:03:54.770> and<00:03:54.920> he<00:03:54.980> doesn't<00:03:55.430> get<00:03:55.550> his

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
turned too late and he doesn't get his

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.190 
turned too late and he doesn't get his
fact<00:03:55.880> for<00:03:56.090> a<00:03:56.120> light<00:03:56.420> pole<00:03:56.600> so<00:03:56.690> he<00:03:56.750> gets<00:03:56.960> missed

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
fact for a light pole so he gets missed

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.540 
fact for a light pole so he gets missed
the<00:03:57.320> timing<00:03:57.530> because<00:03:57.830> he<00:03:57.950> goes<00:03:58.070> first<00:03:58.280> synchro

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
the timing because he goes first synchro

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.080 
the timing because he goes first synchro
so<00:03:59.300> we<00:03:59.480> will<00:03:59.570> set<00:03:59.720> this<00:03:59.900> and<00:04:00.170> maybe<00:04:01.040> my<00:04:01.310> it's

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
so we will set this and maybe my it's

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.600 
so we will set this and maybe my it's
game<00:04:02.300> there's<00:04:03.700> almost<00:04:04.700> nothing<00:04:05.180> I<00:04:06.400> say<00:04:07.400> almost

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
game there's almost nothing I say almost

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.100 
game there's almost nothing I say almost
because<00:04:07.880> he<00:04:08.120> can<00:04:08.240> still<00:04:08.420> drop<00:04:08.540> our<00:04:08.750> call<00:04:08.960> and
