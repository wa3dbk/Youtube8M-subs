00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.430
 they explain it to the trainer 9 of the trainer 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.430
 in front of him one drives home one brings up 

00:00:09.069 --> 00:00:13.199
 But I never played Poleschner Marl I would like to do this 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:16.199
 dfb game not winter proof so play 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:21.269
 the process becomes 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.859
 then it will not 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:29.409
 so you have to see very far picture SN APA is forgotten » 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:33.359
 However, they do not have to set working hours by about two and a half 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.040
 You can start using travelers but hear me 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.470
 now it is clear 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.800
 Bangkok 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.280
 the Hamburg awesome game 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.410
 Percent 20 845 million 92 have been commented on 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.710
 we were projecting the flames and way the player can 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.710
 Of course we are more rek 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:01.930
 4 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.710
 finally turned a version and unfortunately the German version because 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.780
 here they are far from good 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.770
 also a bad weather Niedersachsens same see that I again 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.570
 left the left to put is a person and appropriate criminal proceedings 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.180
 on the ground floor place to the election winner 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.070
 Yes, yes, thank you very much for being here 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.490
 just as much going on 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.660
 The "Rheinische Post" "It was not that difficult 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.530
 I was so badly damaged that he made his ship so heavy 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.530
 damaged that he can not fly anymore 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.330
 ca 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.210
 Well, well, if I want to know this smart then I have to go to them 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.950
 come 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.950
 neither Veh nor closer will appear 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.080
 No 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.850
 Bayern Munich is still unclear 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:58.770
 Menden 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.630
 that his team had to 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.630
 Christoph Strässer 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.650
 Well, so the page overnight on Tuesday 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.810
 that's good to know that means when they are in teams right 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.459
 the Bund 

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:32.199
 the small truck 

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:35.039
 from ours 

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:36.580
 the three wins on the Main 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.580
 Year and two days booked 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:44.129
 So who that means that the club need to feel despite their children 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.359
 is a once to be completed at 4:30 pm are quite obvious 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:52.299
 Hansa Rostock is also a translation error 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:57.229
 or just her right in the Zeitz celebration on it all clear 

00:02:57.229 --> 00:03:00.229
 Of course, this information is very useful at the beginning 

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:03.129
 hardly anything from Kirdorf 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:04.799
 similar 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.299
 we have achieved three locations with each other 

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:12.229
 Maniac Research is enough 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.039
 what can the user be? 

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:18.039
 object 

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:24.979
 as obviously risked the best 28-year-old five missions 

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:27.339
 we are very bad 

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:30.339
 that would be Anna 

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:34.189
 then come every time hope the players take the already 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:37.419
 this meadow 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:39.690
 the cots in the pc version the indigenous ones 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.239
 the press reports 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.939
 which does not save the entire memory system the same passwords always saved 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:49.800
 a system all players and coaches in the highest tones password 

00:03:50.529 --> 00:03:53.819
 Constanze Matthes playing with our system abroad 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.009
 then the whole thing does not play in the front of all your senses or make 

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:59.159
 but it does not matter 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:02.459
 116 in a pretty tight tie 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.459
 a medal gives possible political change 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:09.729
 but that is changing 

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:12.729
 so the first mission was too long to show in itself 

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:16.199
 because the players stop hiring 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.900
 and if one does not hope there, despite a toe bruise, very first missions and 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.319
 the next time something different than a year ago
