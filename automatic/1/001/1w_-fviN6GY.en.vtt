00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.700 
alright everyone so I'm back it is a new
day<00:00:03.210> I<00:00:03.449> am<00:00:03.689> somewhere<00:00:04.020> different<00:00:04.230> now<00:00:04.500> than

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
day I am somewhere different now than

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.299 
day I am somewhere different now than
last<00:00:04.890> time<00:00:05.330> so<00:00:06.330> this<00:00:07.259> actually<00:00:07.440> does<00:00:07.830> work<00:00:07.980> now

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
last time so this actually does work now

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.400 
last time so this actually does work now
I<00:00:09.980> can<00:00:10.980> join<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:11.460> disjoined<00:00:11.940> so<00:00:12.780> I<00:00:13.049> think<00:00:13.320> I

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
I can join I disjoined so I think I

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.810 
I can join I disjoined so I think I
might<00:00:13.530> be<00:00:13.559> able<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:13.830> make<00:00:13.920> my<00:00:14.099> own<00:00:14.280> world<00:00:14.580> and

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
might be able to make my own world and

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.330 
might be able to make my own world and
this<00:00:15.660> is<00:00:15.809> minecraft<00:00:16.260> realms<00:00:16.500> so<00:00:16.830> I'm<00:00:17.010> not

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
inconvenience but always I wouldn't be

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.799 
inconvenience but always I wouldn't be
doing<00:00:29.820> this<00:00:30.000> well<00:00:30.359> that's<00:00:30.570> like<00:00:30.840> man<00:00:32.809> okay

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
there we go morlak so this I don't know

there we go morlak so this I don't know
how<00:00:36.630> this<00:00:36.780> system<00:00:37.020> works<00:00:37.230> like<00:00:37.649> seriously<00:00:38.010> I

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
how this system works like seriously I

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.270 
how this system works like seriously I
think<00:00:39.719> maybe<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.079> kind<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.379> works<00:00:40.590> like<00:00:40.800> Xbox

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
think maybe it kind of works like Xbox

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.630 
think maybe it kind of works like Xbox

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.520 
know if there's going to be a friends
list<00:00:48.210> system<00:00:48.420> but<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:48.930> should<00:00:49.500> probably

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
list system but I should probably

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.130 
list system but I should probably
actually<00:00:49.890> pause<00:00:50.250> this<00:00:50.430> right<00:00:50.640> now<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.140> search

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
actually pause this right now and search

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.080 
actually pause this right now and search

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
cool if you don't in a way maybe you can

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.789 
cool if you don't in a way maybe you can
make<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:01.859> people<00:01:01.890> can<00:01:02.250> build<00:01:02.430> oh<00:01:03.619> you<00:01:04.619> can

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
make it so people can build oh you can

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.760 
make it so people can build oh you can
build<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.990> so<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.140> kind<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.439> like<00:01:07.530> some

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
build that so this kind of like some

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.620
