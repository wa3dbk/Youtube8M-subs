00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:05.240
 they come here I have a man who says because he thinks that riquelme is the best 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.760
 Argentine player that was 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.759
 therefore of the time 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:11.019
 the world ana miranda 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:15.279
 Roberto Torres de San just but enormous talent added that think that what 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:17.970
 it could be said 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.380
 at some point the best Argentine player 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.989
 at least 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:27.479
 I want to tell you that not only the pines, not Emilio, before the World Cup, 

00:00:27.479 --> 00:00:30.789
 only Argentine player who was among the 50 best in wealth 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:32.560
 be more an idea of ​​mine 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.960
 in it the European commentators that the only player they placed 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.300
 in the sahara 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.570
 the deputy patrick helmes 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.570
 but 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:46.950
 if a guy we are 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.860
 wheel said is also the best 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.900
 there are those who evaluated their technique usually its effectiveness 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.059
 its strategic location 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.140
 this title because its aesthetics I do not believe that riquelme is a player who 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.180
 think throughout the game 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.550
 r who have a technical command 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.860
 erik the terrible morals had no major problems 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.140
 this guy is certain that he can think that what worries him I do not know where 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.220
 is the ball outside has perfectly controlled 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.530
 vélez that has a good shot that has 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.690
 it's a very good game reading very well 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.990
 very fast mobility the figure my engineer the mipymes in this case 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.850
 did not like it either 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.159
 nec that scares me a little slow but objective is that of this event 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.580
 borges 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.900
 remember 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.660
 cygan lose it 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.360
 nobody simplifies a lot 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.770
 the attitude of don benito juárez place has that he proposed 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:42.609
 but he can not 

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:45.629
 he says it because he's late, I do not doubt what wealth his coastal fleet has 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.070
 now that riquelme resolves 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.049
 certainly is that the agreement has a lack 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.049
 that's what he agreed to be slow 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.610
 see what it is that suits you something to be cured 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.500
 it seems to me that riquelme has 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.430
 virtues like to become the best player 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.429
 Argentinian thing that others do not have 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.599
 I do not know if he is the best Argentinean but he has virtues as a good 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.179
 moment dies a superior period of high performance as last name 

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:19.179
 Become the best Argentine player 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.459
 I can not say the same thing in more than five or six players 

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:26.479
 well clinton 

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:29.769
 played badly the world which may be that the curve I think that 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.829
 we do not remember mar I think there is another charge but what happens is that if 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.609
 they expected more desperate mother that the epoc is much better player 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:42.639
 while the other has out there reached its ceiling and it seems to me that 

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:45.639
 there are some said that it's way below the floor 

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:49.899
 if so, no matter how much they say what they want 

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:52.719
 maybe some friends 

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:55.109
 this one of the corporations 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:58.449
 n journalistic that they have taken with their own thing and then 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:04.239
 I like how the central defenders play the numbers 5 and 15 h 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.399
 I do not even receive it as serious 

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:09.399
 there will be five that kicked her strong grill 

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:14.369
 the best players that have detected process the court forward has 

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:15.299
 explained 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:20.650
 r what does not mean that you have to play without 4 told you what you mean is 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.749
 that the best of us we put four 

00:03:23.749 --> 00:03:27.339
 the best of us can live without you popular comes mouth listening is one 

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:29.639
 of the best not because it is one of the worst 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:30.689
 the turks landete
