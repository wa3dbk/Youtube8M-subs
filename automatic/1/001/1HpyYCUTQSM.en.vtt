banana<00:00:03.510> and<00:00:04.040> this<00:00:05.040> one's<00:00:05.250> gonna<00:00:05.430> be<00:00:05.670> a<00:00:05.700> little

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
banana and this one's gonna be a little

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.560 
banana and this one's gonna be a little
bit<00:00:06.240> of<00:00:06.359> a<00:00:06.450> tricky<00:00:06.870> one<00:00:07.080> and<00:00:08.330> I'll<00:00:09.330> probably

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
bit of a tricky one and I'll probably

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.299 
bit of a tricky one and I'll probably
just<00:00:09.780> have<00:00:10.019> to<00:00:10.050> show<00:00:10.320> you<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.559> theory<00:00:10.980> and

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
just have to show you the theory and

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.079 
just have to show you the theory and
maybe<00:00:11.610> not<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.120> actual<00:00:13.280> banana<00:00:14.280> which<00:00:14.759> sounds

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
maybe not the actual banana which sounds

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.060 
maybe not the actual banana which sounds
confusing<00:00:15.509> now<00:00:15.929> but<00:00:16.260> trust<00:00:16.470> me<00:00:16.619> you'll<00:00:16.830> get<00:00:16.980> it

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
confusing now but trust me you'll get it

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.480 
confusing now but trust me you'll get it

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
the beetle and finish with 50 coins and

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:29.830 
the beetle and finish with 50 coins and
leave<00:01:23.060> I<00:01:26.380> recommend<00:01:27.380> hitting<00:01:27.770> the<00:01:27.860> beetle<00:01:28.840> it

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
leave I recommend hitting the beetle it

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.150 
leave I recommend hitting the beetle it
always<00:01:30.230> worked<00:01:30.500> for<00:01:30.710> me<00:01:32.440> now<00:01:33.440> I<00:01:33.470> might<00:01:33.800> not<00:01:33.980> win

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
always worked for me now I might not win

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.930 
always worked for me now I might not win
the<00:01:34.280> first<00:01:34.520> try<00:01:34.790> but<00:01:35.210> I<00:01:36.310> probably<00:01:37.310> also<00:01:37.640> will

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
the first try but I probably also will

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.700 
the first try but I probably also will
not<00:01:38.090> record<00:01:38.480> every<00:01:38.930> attempt<00:01:39.290> at<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:39.470> beetle

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
not record every attempt at the beetle

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.910 
not record every attempt at the beetle
until<00:01:39.950> I<00:01:40.040> win<00:01:40.250> but<00:01:40.900> I'll<00:01:41.900> just<00:01:42.200> record<00:01:42.380> enough

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
until I win but I'll just record enough

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.170 
until I win but I'll just record enough
to<00:01:43.280> where<00:01:43.400> you<00:01:43.520> get<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:43.760> point

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
to where you get the point

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.750 
to where you get the point
and<00:01:44.390> just<00:01:44.930> leave<00:01:45.110> it<00:01:45.260> at<00:01:45.350> that<00:01:45.580> just<00:01:46.580> because

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
and just leave it at that just because

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.290 
and just leave it at that just because
it's<00:01:47.770> the<00:01:48.770> most<00:01:48.979> battery<00:01:49.220> saving<00:01:49.760> thing<00:01:50.090> for

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
it's the most battery saving thing for

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.480 
it's the most battery saving thing for
me<00:01:50.390> to<00:01:50.479> do<00:01:53.080> you<00:01:54.080> can<00:01:54.259> fall<00:01:54.500> off<00:01:54.530> those<00:01:55.040> types<00:01:55.310> of

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
me to do you can fall off those types of

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.630 
me to do you can fall off those types of
edges<00:01:55.790> so<00:01:55.970> watch<00:01:56.150> out

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.730 

remember<00:02:01.390> you<00:02:01.510> have<00:02:01.630> to<00:02:01.660> have<00:02:01.840> 50<00:02:02.020> coins<00:02:02.380> and

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
remember you have to have 50 coins and

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:09.700 
remember you have to have 50 coins and
win<00:02:03.220> so<00:02:04.980> it's<00:02:05.980> a<00:02:06.160> little<00:02:06.400> bit<00:02:06.550> tricky

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:16.310 

all<00:02:10.400> right

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:23.580 

you<00:02:17.320> can<00:02:17.470> hit<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.710> Beagle<00:02:18.010> at<00:02:18.100> the<00:02:18.190> end<00:02:18.340> -<00:02:22.590> if

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
you can hit the Beagle at the end - if

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.280 
you can hit the Beagle at the end - if
he<00:02:23.740> gets<00:02:23.920> in<00:02:24.130> front<00:02:24.340> of<00:02:24.430> you<00:02:24.520> at<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:24.730> end<00:02:24.760> here

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
he gets in front of you at the end here

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.200 
he gets in front of you at the end here
you<00:02:26.290> can<00:02:26.440> hit<00:02:26.560> him<00:02:26.710> in<00:02:26.890> two

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:38.080 

but<00:02:31.810> I<00:02:31.840> think<00:02:32.110> I<00:02:32.200> got<00:02:32.380> it

you<00:02:40.980> don't<00:02:41.070> know<00:02:41.190> how<00:02:41.370> rare<00:02:41.760> that<00:02:41.790> is<00:02:42.060> I<00:02:42.510> just

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
you don't know how rare that is I just

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:52.430 
you don't know how rare that is I just
barely<00:02:43.530> beat<00:02:43.830> him<00:02:43.980> -<00:02:46.730> okay<00:02:50.960> and<00:02:51.960> that<00:02:52.170> makes
