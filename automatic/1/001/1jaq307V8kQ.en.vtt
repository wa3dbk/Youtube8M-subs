00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.479
 hello how about this time I'm going to 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:12.820
 teach how to fix our panel 

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:15.549
 the door of a ford k the rest all 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:18.849
 usually a majority of those because 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:23.349
 here in that problem that is broken because 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:24.810
 this cardboard as we see it here is from 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.720
 paperboard 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.689
 and the use or moisture will 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.720
 is going is breaking then what we're going 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.630
 to do is very simple very simple 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:40.680
 in the back we're going to see we're going to 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:43.800
 put a cardboard 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.340
 hard gast칩n we are going to give him the form of 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.660
 what it is 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:52.660
 it rests all 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:56.070
 let's use a glue type h what 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:59.320
 resistol 5000 a glue that really 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.970
 stick interest that well to be able to give 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.900
 the way and that little dejes charm 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.130
 one night 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.659
 so that it will stick very well 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.509
 So what we are going to do is very 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:13.120
 simple let's use the technique of the 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:16.290
 pi침ata we are going to use 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:19.530
 what is resistor 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.540
 white glue that the arteries are worth 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.630
 15 pesos a half liter and we 're going to 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.490
 occupy less underground newspapers 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.740
 that we all have in our house 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.440
 so not to spend so much we're going to 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.770
 do the following I tell them that we use 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:38.380
 the pi침ata technique we break 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.990
 little pieces we can not cachito 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:45.090
 of newspaper and with the same glue what 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:48.420
 we are sticking bits in several layers 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.750
 and we are giving the form so that it is 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.050
 very well several layers of glue with 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:59.300
 newspaper will more or less be like this 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:02.150
 well this is almost finished 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:05.000
 here as you see here I put many layers 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.890
 of glue with a newspaper style 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.289
 pi침ata I think many have done 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:15.280
 customers at home with balloons 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:19.130
 and it 's a paste and glue newspaper 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.050
 and as you can see if it hardens very well 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.790
 we can 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:27.510
 then to chop it well 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.410
 and put the door and as you can see that also 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.350
 You can put him on this side 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.680
 or as you like to reinforce it more good 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.710
 Well, that's all very simple, very 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:42.600
 economic to fix our panel 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.600
 see you thank you very much
