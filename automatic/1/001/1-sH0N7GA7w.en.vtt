00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
and this way you're going to get a

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.530 
and this way you're going to get a
really<00:00:39.000> clean<00:00:39.540> reading<00:00:40.020> on<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:41.010> tuner<00:00:41.540> now

registers we're going to start with our

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.310 
registers we're going to start with our
a<00:00:55.289> string

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.520

dinner we do have a D registering
however<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.820> needle<00:02:05.149> is<00:02:05.270> not<00:02:05.509> pointing

this means that the note is too high

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.320 
this means that the note is too high
it's<00:02:18.410> too<00:02:18.590> sharp<00:02:18.890> we<00:02:19.430> need<00:02:19.610> to<00:02:19.730> lower<00:02:20.000> the

let's<00:03:01.459> also<00:03:01.700> watch<00:03:02.120> a<00:03:02.420> brief<00:03:02.690> clip<00:03:03.020> of<00:03:03.380> tuning

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
let's also watch a brief clip of tuning

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.479 
let's also watch a brief clip of tuning
our<00:03:04.280> cello<00:03:05.470> here<00:03:06.470> we're<00:03:06.620> also<00:03:06.800> going<00:03:07.100> to<00:03:07.190> start

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
our cello here we're also going to start

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:13.180 
our cello here we're also going to start
with<00:03:07.580> our<00:03:07.640> a<00:03:07.940> string<00:03:10.510> if<00:03:11.560> we<00:03:12.560> look<00:03:12.709> the<00:03:12.920> tuner

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
with our a string if we look the tuner

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.670 
with our a string if we look the tuner
is<00:03:13.310> actually<00:03:13.910> reading<00:03:14.180> a<00:03:14.450> b-flat<00:03:15.050> right<00:03:15.470> now

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
is actually reading a b-flat right now

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.910 
is actually reading a b-flat right now
and<00:03:16.010> our<00:03:16.910> first<00:03:17.120> rule<00:03:17.510> is<00:03:17.750> to<00:03:17.900> make<00:03:18.019> sure<00:03:18.290> that

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
and our first rule is to make sure that

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.370 
and our first rule is to make sure that
note<00:03:19.220> made<00:03:19.250> matches<00:03:19.849> our<00:03:20.000> string<00:03:20.360> name<00:03:20.569> right

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
note made matches our string name right

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.830 
note made matches our string name right
now<00:03:21.530> that's<00:03:21.680> not<00:03:21.860> the<00:03:22.099> case<00:03:22.220> we<00:03:22.760> want<00:03:23.000> an<00:03:23.120> A<00:03:23.510> and

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
now that's not the case we want an A and

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.380 
now that's not the case we want an A and
right<00:03:24.050> now<00:03:24.170> we're<00:03:24.350> getting<00:03:24.560> a<00:03:24.650> b-flat<00:03:25.269> we<00:03:26.269> have

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
right now we're getting a b-flat we have

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.300 
right now we're getting a b-flat we have
to<00:03:26.510> use<00:03:26.660> our<00:03:26.810> musical<00:03:27.230> knowledge<00:03:27.410> to<00:03:27.860> know<00:03:28.040> if

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
to use our musical knowledge to know if

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.180 
to use our musical knowledge to know if
B<00:03:28.910> flat<00:03:29.180> is<00:03:29.390> going<00:03:29.540> to<00:03:29.600> be<00:03:29.690> higher<00:03:29.989> or<00:03:30.350> lower

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
B flat is going to be higher or lower

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.910 
B flat is going to be higher or lower
than<00:03:31.730> a<00:03:32.390> I<00:03:32.690> always<00:03:33.560> use<00:03:33.950> our<00:03:34.310> alphabet<00:03:35.920> with

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
than a I always use our alphabet with

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.670 
than a I always use our alphabet with
the<00:03:36.950> music<00:03:38.530> abcdefg<00:03:39.530> a<00:03:39.739> is<00:03:40.489> below<00:03:40.970> B<00:03:41.680> becomes

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
the music abcdefg a is below B becomes

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.070 
the music abcdefg a is below B becomes
after<00:03:43.100> a<00:03:43.370> that<00:03:43.970> means<00:03:44.209> the<00:03:44.420> B<00:03:44.569> is<00:03:44.720> going<00:03:44.900> to<00:03:44.959> be

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
after a that means the B is going to be

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.860 
after a that means the B is going to be
higher<00:03:45.470> than<00:03:46.190> the<00:03:46.400> a<00:03:46.640> right<00:03:47.330> now<00:03:47.600> that<00:03:47.840> means

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
higher than the a right now that means

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.570 
higher than the a right now that means
it's<00:03:48.230> too<00:03:48.470> sharp<00:03:48.860> and<00:03:49.100> we're<00:03:49.310> going<00:03:49.430> to<00:03:49.459> be

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
it's too sharp and we're going to be

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:57.670 
it's too sharp and we're going to be
turning<00:03:49.819> it<00:03:50.150> to<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:51.380> left

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
and as you see we're starting to get to

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.309 
and as you see we're starting to get to
the<00:03:59.989> a<00:04:00.019> on<00:04:00.939> the<00:04:01.939> right<00:04:02.150> side<00:04:02.420> and<00:04:02.750> as<00:04:02.930> we<00:04:03.109> turn

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 
the a on the right side and as we turn

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.649 
the a on the right side and as we turn
to<00:04:03.500> the<00:04:03.620> left<00:04:03.799> we<00:04:04.219> get<00:04:04.400> closer<00:04:04.609> and<00:04:05.000> closer<00:04:05.209> to

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:05.659 
to the left we get closer and closer to

to the left we get closer and closer to
in<00:04:06.469> tune

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.910
