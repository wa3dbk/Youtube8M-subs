gonna<00:00:14.250> make<00:00:14.490> this<00:00:14.639> teleport<00:00:15.299> machine<00:00:15.719> that

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
gonna make this teleport machine that

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.349 
gonna make this teleport machine that
teleports<00:00:16.650> us<00:00:16.800> up<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.400> surface<00:00:18.000> of<00:00:18.240> the

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
teleports us up to the surface of the
