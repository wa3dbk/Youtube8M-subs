and you know dipping as you get closer
to<00:01:04.320> empty<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.460> know<00:01:05.729> when<00:01:05.939> it's<00:01:06.090> time<00:01:06.360> to

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.399 
to empty so you know when it's time to
recharge<00:01:06.990> but<00:01:08.119> recharging<00:01:09.119> from<00:01:09.510> empty<00:01:10.080> takes

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.280 
a long four hours out of the box it's

own and yet it's light and maneuverable
I<00:01:19.439> kind<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.070> thought<00:01:20.280> it'd<00:01:20.490> be<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.640> nice

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
I kind of thought it'd be a nice

I kind of thought it'd be a nice
combination<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:22.200> being<00:01:22.439> sturdy<00:01:22.979> like<00:01:23.250> an

combination of being sturdy like an

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.149 
combination of being sturdy like an
upright<00:01:23.670> while<00:01:24.330> still<00:01:24.750> having<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.380> ease<00:01:25.860> of

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
upright while still having that ease of

upright while still having that ease of
maneuverability<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.299> stick<00:01:27.659> but<00:01:28.020> it

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
maneuverability of a stick but it

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.170 
maneuverability of a stick but it
certainly<00:01:28.590> does<00:01:28.920> not<00:01:28.950> have<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.640> power<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:30.090> an
