00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.009
 Hello everyone for this first video 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.010
 of retouching we will focus our 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.559
 thinking about intention research 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.059
 of a good image level for this purpose I do not 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.429
 will not show you tools that 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.740
 I use to retouch in order to 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.570
 focus our attention first 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.910
 the photo itself and on the way 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.130
 which are sold evolved I'm working on 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.230
 this view but with a chisel effect 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.180
 is pretty interesting but a rendering 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.179
 maybe a little bland the colors a 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.460
 little indented and a contrast maybe 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.660
 slightly to boost then I'm going 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.280
 try to voice at first 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.890
 how can I think about doing 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.370
 evolve its colors its contrast its 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.770
 brightness to get more renderings 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.160
 wear with a better visual impact and 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.950
 also to change his mood and 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.020
 the member also more personal yes we 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.239
 can be at first if I 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.610
 can try to boost a small or the 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.640
 colors without getting a 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.460
 effect on saturated I try both to 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.610
 warm up the atmosphere to develop the 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.600
 color of the water and then obviously of 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.640
 still retain a contract this enough 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.229
 pleasant to the eye 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.530
 that's what it could give like 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.290
 first reaction where is the photo of 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.299
 raw was a little bit a little bland 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.590
 colors a tel meal that's how I 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.170
 can try to get a first 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.170
 contrasted reaction and especially with a 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.290
 intent focused on the development of 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.799
 his colors with this blue duo and then 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.400
 other orange and it's interesting to 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.500
 develop 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.439
 I come back to the photo crane and I try 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.020
 to imagine another rendering for example 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.799
 with brighter contrast always 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.960
 in colors 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:50.060
 actually something more than 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.810
 clearer more dynamic at the level 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:57.020
 contrast of brightness a small 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.869
 silhouettes effect that's interesting 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.899
 while staying on colors this 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.209
 times here present but passed and a 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.469
 made quite clear I'll even if 

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:10.160
 maybe from your job and the 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:12.769
 colors to have a little atmosphere 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.299
 more how to say more vintage a 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.099
 side a little to cross processing 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:18.049
 that makes it possible to have a rendering 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.640
 original because could give a 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.530
 second sold for this photo to 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.180
 again I come back on the raw photo 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.629
 to show you a bit of what 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.629
 way 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:28.280
 I changed the aspect of this 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:31.040
 photo and its atmosphere also it 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.459
 happens lighter more light more 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.440
 why not also 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:39.349
 maybe consider a black treatment 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.970
 and white of this photo is the excess 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:44.930
 kind of silhouette effects is enough 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:47.180
 conducive to imagine a photo immediately 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.269
 black and white even like that with a 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.519
 made quite classic also a first 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.109
 so art and white gassion but it can 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.569
 be interesting to try to imagine 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:58.220
 as well as to members modely contrast 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.639
 to be more personal more 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.650
 original also black and white 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:05.690
 why not with this photo search 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.840
 a little darker a bit more 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.680
 more dramatic or that would be dominated 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.810
 by the black 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.120
 yes for example with a wind maybe 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.650
 that this one would have smoky it was 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.359
 really also a good enhancement 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.140
 of the silhouette and materials of the 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:19.760
 beach 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.220
 really also a very rendering 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.350
 interesting through this first 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.600
 demonstration I propose to encourage you 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.840
 during your alterations to not always 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.640
 pasted 100% mom on the picture and her 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.830
 rank from the beginning by just doing 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.810
 a simple optimization a little shy 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.360
 but really whether it's on the 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.850
 contract what are you going to work if 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.170
 it's more about the color of what 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.800
 way you're going to want to do them 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.860
 evolve 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.410
 for a rather airy and bright rendering 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.870
 or rather dramatic do not hesitate to 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.910
 implement ideas during your 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.610
 touch-ups to get 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.080
 made particularly creative when 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.720
 our next videos I will show you 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.959
 how do I use audi some 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.560
 tools different tools to get this 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:08.120
 type of sold by then do not hesitate to 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.670
 discover my book edit your photos 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.190
 by to go further and follow them 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.550
 on my site off to 4 points as a 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.550
 very quickly
