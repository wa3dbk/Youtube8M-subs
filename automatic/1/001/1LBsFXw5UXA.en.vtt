00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.290 
matter whether it's a foundation it is
my<00:00:42.989> strength<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.739> very<00:00:43.770> full<00:00:44.340> coverage<00:00:44.760> or<00:00:45.120> very

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
my strength a very full coverage or very

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.330 
my strength a very full coverage or very
light<00:00:45.510> coverage<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.320> just<00:00:46.739> lightens<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.250> up

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
light coverage it just lightens it up

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.889 
light coverage it just lightens it up
beautifully<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.329> doesn't<00:00:48.600> interrupt

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
beautifully and it doesn't interrupt

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.040 
beautifully and it doesn't interrupt
with<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.969> consistency<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.449> products<00:00:51.870> so

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
with the consistency of the products so

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.900 
with the consistency of the products so
it<00:00:52.170> doesn't<00:00:52.440> make<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.710> too<00:00:52.890> watery<00:00:53.520> or<00:00:53.640> too

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
it doesn't make it too watery or too

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.360 
it doesn't make it too watery or too
thin<00:00:53.940> it's<00:00:54.870> also<00:00:55.050> not<00:00:55.320> oil-based<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.219> goes

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
thin it's also not oil-based so it goes

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.979 
thin it's also not oil-based so it goes
well<00:00:56.640> with<00:00:56.820> water-based<00:00:57.149> products<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.960> I

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
well with water-based products and I

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.630 
well with water-based products and I
just<00:00:58.199> think<00:00:58.350> it's<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.530> beautiful<00:00:58.980> foundation

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
just think it's a beautiful foundation

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.520 
just think it's a beautiful foundation
and<00:00:59.879> actually<00:01:00.359> have<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.629> on<00:01:00.750> today<00:01:00.899> mixed<00:01:01.410> with

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
and actually have it on today mixed with

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.799 
and actually have it on today mixed with
my<00:01:01.680> mac<00:01:01.859> studio<00:01:02.160> sculpt<00:01:02.609> foundation<00:01:02.760> melt<00:01:03.600> I

my mac studio sculpt foundation melt I

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.420

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
wouldn't be able to work the majority of

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.039 
wouldn't be able to work the majority of
foundations<00:01:06.060> because<00:01:06.390> they<00:01:06.479> just<00:01:06.659> pass<00:01:06.840> you

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
foundations because they just pass you

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.840

dark<00:01:07.320> for<00:01:07.530> me<00:01:07.560> even<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.950> lighter<00:01:08.189> shades<00:01:08.760> you

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
dark for me even a lighter shades you

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.690 
dark for me even a lighter shades you
know<00:01:08.970> they'll<00:01:09.479> call<00:01:09.780> them<00:01:09.930> like<00:01:09.990> porcelain

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
know they'll call them like porcelain

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.520 
know they'll call them like porcelain
ivory<00:01:11.700> fear<00:01:12.240> when<00:01:12.780> actually<00:01:13.170> they're<00:01:13.380> quite

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
ivory fear when actually they're quite

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.469 
ivory fear when actually they're quite

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
deep orange on two terms and if you have

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.240 
deep orange on two terms and if you have
incredibly<00:01:15.930> fair<00:01:16.229> skin<00:01:16.530> like<00:01:16.710> me<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.009> can<00:01:17.159> be

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
incredibly fair skin like me it can be

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.950 
incredibly fair skin like me it can be
so<00:01:17.490> difficult<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:18.180> find<00:01:18.390> matches<00:01:18.810> of

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
so difficult to find matches of

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.960 
so difficult to find matches of
foundations<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.430> why<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.580> will<00:01:20.790> date

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
foundations so this is why I will date

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.370 
foundations so this is why I will date
you<00:01:21.000> don't<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.450> i<00:01:21.479> literally<00:01:21.840> just<00:01:21.930> need<00:01:22.170> one

hand in with whatever products I'm using
as<00:01:26.580> my<00:01:26.759> base<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.600> just<00:01:27.750> works<00:01:27.960> beautifully

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
as my base and it just works beautifully

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.530

so I highly recommend this is a little

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.210 
so I highly recommend this is a little
bit<00:01:30.630> difficult<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.170> get<00:01:31.320> hold<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.770> but<00:01:32.009> you

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
bit difficult to get hold of but you

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
got it the right way around that's what

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.090 
got it the right way around that's what
I<00:02:14.120> really<00:02:14.450> like<00:02:14.600> about<00:02:14.630> this<00:02:14.960> product<00:02:15.410> is<00:02:15.530> the

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
I really like about this product is the

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.530 
I really like about this product is the
fact<00:02:16.310> that<00:02:16.370> because<00:02:16.670> it's<00:02:16.820> a<00:02:16.880> cream

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
fact that because it's a cream

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.900 
fact that because it's a cream
goes<00:02:17.780> on<00:02:17.990> so<00:02:18.290> much<00:02:18.470> more<00:02:18.710> naturally<00:02:19.220> and<00:02:19.760> also

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
goes on so much more naturally and also

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.300 
goes on so much more naturally and also
I<00:02:20.360> find<00:02:20.660> that<00:02:20.750> sometimes<00:02:20.990> when<00:02:21.830> I<00:02:21.890> apply<00:02:22.280> a

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
I find that sometimes when I apply a

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.790 
I find that sometimes when I apply a
powder<00:02:22.700> blush<00:02:23.060> sometimes<00:02:23.870> it<00:02:24.290> can<00:02:24.440> sit<00:02:24.620> very

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
powder blush sometimes it can sit very

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.990 
powder blush sometimes it can sit very
heavy<00:02:25.100> on<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.370> skin<00:02:25.700> and<00:02:25.730> if<00:02:25.910> you

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
heavy on the skin and if you

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.810 
heavy on the skin and if you

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
that I was a shade too because I thought

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.440 
that I was a shade too because I thought
I<00:04:22.790> might<00:04:22.880> be<00:04:23.210> shamed<00:04:23.750> one<00:04:24.080> or<00:04:24.440> whatever<00:04:24.770> but

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
I might be shamed one or whatever but

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.700 
I might be shamed one or whatever but
the<00:04:26.450> lady<00:04:26.630> actually<00:04:27.050> said<00:04:27.230> it's<00:04:27.380> not<00:04:27.500> about

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710

the lady actually said it's not about
your<00:04:27.890> skin<00:04:28.220> tone<00:04:28.490> with<00:04:28.670> these<00:04:28.820> bronzers

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
your skin tone with these bronzers

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.910 
your skin tone with these bronzers
actually<00:04:29.720> about<00:04:29.870> the<00:04:30.050> undertones<00:04:30.560> to<00:04:30.800> your

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
actually about the undertones to your

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.280 
actually about the undertones to your
skin<00:04:31.310> and<00:04:31.460> I<00:04:32.180> got<00:04:32.390> quite<00:04:32.630> cool<00:04:32.930> fair

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
undertones and so this just sits well

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.060

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
and have to say that it does add a lot

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:45.930 
about shade 16 is the fact that it's so

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.389 
about shade 16 is the fact that it's so
beautiful<00:06:46.930> against<00:06:47.319> most<00:06:47.740> skin<00:06:47.979> tones<00:06:48.249> but

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:48.399 
beautiful against most skin tones but

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:50.760 
beautiful against most skin tones but
especially<00:06:48.610> pale<00:06:49.119> skin<00:06:49.449> tones<00:06:49.719> because<00:06:49.959> it

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:50.770 
especially pale skin tones because it

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.279 
especially pale skin tones because it
just<00:06:51.069> glides<00:06:51.430> on<00:06:51.759> beautifully<00:06:52.689> and<00:06:52.990> it<00:06:53.080> works

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:53.289 
just glides on beautifully and it works

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:54.779 
just glides on beautifully and it works
while<00:06:53.619> the<00:06:53.800> skin<00:06:54.039> tone<00:06:54.249> it<00:06:54.369> adds<00:06:54.520> a<00:06:54.610> bit<00:06:54.729> of

00:06:54.779 --> 00:06:54.789 
while the skin tone it adds a bit of

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:56.760 
while the skin tone it adds a bit of
life<00:06:55.059> and<00:06:55.270> color<00:06:55.449> without<00:06:55.990> being<00:06:56.319> too<00:06:56.529> much

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:56.770 
life and color without being too much

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:58.079 
life and color without being too much
and<00:06:57.039> I<00:06:57.099> think<00:06:57.309> actually<00:06:57.430> a<00:06:57.639> lot<00:06:57.759> of<00:06:57.879> skin

00:06:58.079 --> 00:06:58.089 
and I think actually a lot of skin

00:06:58.089 --> 00:07:00.329 
and I think actually a lot of skin
actually<00:06:58.809> think<00:06:59.229> a<00:06:59.349> lot<00:06:59.529> of<00:06:59.559> skin<00:06:59.889> tones<00:07:00.159> could

00:07:00.329 --> 00:07:00.339 
actually think a lot of skin tones could

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:01.980 
actually think a lot of skin tones could
get<00:07:00.520> away<00:07:00.610> with<00:07:00.729> wearing<00:07:01.089> this<00:07:01.419> it's<00:07:01.689> such<00:07:01.959> a
