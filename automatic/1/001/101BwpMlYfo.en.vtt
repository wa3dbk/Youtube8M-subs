00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:08.540
 hello my name is a nature ibicenca and 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.820
 I also live in ibiza 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.879
 I currently run a radio station 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.400
 and he combined it with my work as 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:19.990
 disc-jockey for two years now the 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.280
 true the place where I reside is 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:26.770
 one of the main points for the 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:30.110
 which I decided to involve myself in a career 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:33.829
 publicist with the theme of music 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.839
 also being on a radio then 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.910
 some way 100% electronic music from 

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:41.480
 some way then 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:44.120
 is what I've seen all my life and one day 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:48.660
 I said go for it and forward the 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.760
 learning has been long and a little 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.899
 to 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:58.379
 in privacy because by being exposed 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.559
 in a showcase as it is ibiza and surrounded 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.739
 of so many talents as I find myself 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:08.610
 my work I have done many hours at home 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.320
 and in studies before putting me on a 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.940
 scenario about a cabin has been very 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.820
 sure that I really could 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.740
 play the job and 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.100
 and not 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.350
 and not throw myself ahead of time to do 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.020
 something that perhaps did not correspond with what 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:29.460
 that with my purpose one of my djs 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.909
 of reference without a doubt is wally lopez me 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.470
 I really like how he transmits the message in 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.520
 the cabin and through the music 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.869
 as well 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:44.159
 both in one slope and in another and a 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:47.469
 maybe model that to see that I like 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.500
 as not only artists but model of 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:53.799
 business and philosophy of carrying a 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:57.310
 company or a richie hawtin brand 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.990
 possibly my favorite artist is a 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.719
 where I would like to click on 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.149
 truth is in an ibiza amnesia that I think 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:07.289
 that the only club on the island where I have not 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:09.009
 state and maybe the new york sky 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.500
 I would like to work professionally 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.710
 with several artists one of them would be 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.100
 wally lopez who 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:20.580
 as I have told you before your line and 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.890
 his musical roll goes a lot with me and 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.320
 other artists would be for me a 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.680
 honor to work with richie hawtin with 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.350
 steve lawler with carola frame and with this 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.800
 line of artists possibly in the ade 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:37.350
 also in Amsterdam dance festival I think 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.240
 that women djs and have a value 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.180
 added and perhaps does not have the man that 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.400
 it's a little the feeling that touch 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.470
 Sensitive sensitivity that can be 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.560
 give a session or even a 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.890
 production this industry has always 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.290
 predominantly the male figure and 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.580
 good little by little women too 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.430
 we are making a hole in this 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.310
 market and I think we do not do it badly what 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.110
 we are doing well my goal is therefore 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.570
 out a little 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.060
 of the environment where I already am 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:13.290
 working and somehow so power 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:16.350
 expose my work so much in the 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.260
 disc jokey sessions like 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.740
 productions internationally I 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.410
 I would like my name to be recognized 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.480
 within this industry like as a 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.480
 figure of professionalism and not as 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.030
 maybe a celebrity figure to say it 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.840
 some way I want I would like that 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.690
 really my music is identified and that 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.050
 be loved and that people enjoy with 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.050
 she
