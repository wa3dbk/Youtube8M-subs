00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
reddish color and then they kind of went

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.099 
reddish color and then they kind of went
to<00:03:12.620> like<00:03:12.860> a<00:03:12.890> purpley<00:03:13.850> pinky<00:03:14.329> color<00:03:14.630> and<00:03:14.959> but

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
they still stood out a little bit and

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.910 
they still stood out a little bit and
some<00:03:17.450> of<00:03:17.570> them<00:03:17.750> I<00:03:18.019> only<00:03:18.170> had<00:03:18.380> to<00:03:18.470> use<00:03:18.500> it<00:03:18.739> once

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
some of them I only had to use it once

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.140 
some of them I only had to use it once
on<00:03:19.160> and<00:03:19.370> then<00:03:19.459> there<00:03:19.609> were<00:03:19.670> a<00:03:19.700> few<00:03:19.940> that<00:03:20.090> I

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
on and then there were a few that I

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.640 
on and then there were a few that I
applied<00:03:20.390> it<00:03:20.510> to<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:20.720> second<00:03:21.109> time<00:03:21.320> because

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
applied it to the second time because

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.280 
applied it to the second time because
they<00:03:21.950> were<00:03:22.040> just<00:03:22.160> still<00:03:22.340> a<00:03:22.370> bit<00:03:22.549> obvious<00:03:22.700> and

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
they were just still a bit obvious and

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.630 
they were just still a bit obvious and
those<00:03:24.290> were<00:03:24.470> the<00:03:24.560> ones<00:03:24.739> that<00:03:24.829> kind<00:03:25.250> of<00:03:25.340> a<00:03:25.430> more

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
those were the ones that kind of a more

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.910 
those were the ones that kind of a more
purple<00:03:26.120> than<00:03:26.150> pink<00:03:26.600> so<00:03:27.290> I<00:03:27.319> just<00:03:27.590> applied<00:03:27.890> it

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
purple than pink so I just applied it

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.890 
purple than pink so I just applied it

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
again in the middle of the month put it

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.960 
again in the middle of the month put it
on<00:03:30.019> and<00:03:30.350> the<00:03:30.829> next<00:03:31.130> day<00:03:31.280> they<00:03:31.489> were<00:03:31.549> lit<00:03:31.790> they

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
on and the next day they were lit they

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.500

would like oh less purple more pinky and

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.319 
would like oh less purple more pinky and
they<00:03:35.630> just<00:03:35.810> they<00:03:36.350> faded<00:03:36.769> a<00:03:37.100> lot<00:03:37.430> whose<00:03:37.940> bio-oil

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
they just they faded a lot whose bio-oil

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:40.210 
they just they faded a lot whose bio-oil
before<00:03:38.959> me<00:03:39.170> I<00:03:39.200> would<00:03:39.410> use<00:03:39.560> it<00:03:39.739> and<00:03:39.829> I<00:03:39.920> said<00:03:40.069> yeah

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
before me I would use it and I said yeah

before me I would use it and I said yeah
this<00:03:40.340> is<00:03:40.489> great<00:03:40.670> and<00:03:40.940> then<00:03:41.060> I<00:03:41.180> stopped<00:03:41.540> because

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
this is great and then I stopped because

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:43.960 
this is great and then I stopped because
my<00:03:42.109> bottom<00:03:42.500> run<00:03:42.709> out<00:03:42.889> I<00:03:43.069> stopped<00:03:43.370> applying<00:03:43.579> it

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
my bottom run out I stopped applying it

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.940 
my bottom run out I stopped applying it
thought<00:03:44.600> that<00:03:44.840> okay<00:03:45.019> that's<00:03:45.380> cool<00:03:45.560> it's<00:03:45.769> done

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.590 
thought that okay that's cool it's done
now<00:03:46.160> like<00:03:46.370> it's<00:03:46.549> lightened<00:03:46.910> and<00:03:47.209> as<00:03:47.299> soon<00:03:47.480> as

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
now like it's lightened and as soon as

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.120 
now like it's lightened and as soon as
you<00:03:47.720> stop<00:03:47.930> applying<00:03:48.230> it<00:03:48.500> or<00:03:48.620> what<00:03:48.829> for<00:03:49.040> me

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
anyway it stopped working

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.720 
anyway it stopped working
it<00:03:50.959> was<00:03:51.079> amazed<00:03:51.470> to<00:03:51.650> see<00:03:51.739> that<00:03:52.160> the<00:03:52.400> lemon

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
it was amazed to see that the lemon

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.379 
it was amazed to see that the lemon
juice<00:03:52.940> which<00:03:53.750> is<00:03:53.900> natural<00:03:54.440> cheaper<00:03:55.160> and<00:03:55.430> all

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:56.389 
juice which is natural cheaper and all

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:57.220 
juice which is natural cheaper and all
that<00:03:56.600> stuff

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
that stuff

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.789 
that stuff
lightened<00:03:58.100> it<00:03:58.250> straight<00:03:58.850> away<00:03:59.060> without<00:03:59.209> any

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
lightened it straight away without any

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.830 
lightened it straight away without any
more<00:04:00.799> touch-ups<00:04:01.519> like<00:04:01.850> of<00:04:02.299> course<00:04:02.569> there<00:04:02.750> were

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
more touch-ups like of course there were

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.539 
more touch-ups like of course there were
the<00:04:03.049> bigger<00:04:03.319> ones<00:04:03.650> that<00:04:03.859> I<00:04:03.889> have<00:04:04.160> to<00:04:04.310> use<00:04:04.400> it

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
the bigger ones that I have to use it

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.340 
the bigger ones that I have to use it
more<00:04:04.670> than<00:04:04.730> once<00:04:05.120> I<00:04:05.510> only<00:04:05.810> had<00:04:05.989> to<00:04:06.079> apply<00:04:06.230> it

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
more than once I only had to apply it

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.500 
more than once I only had to apply it
twice<00:04:06.590> sing<00:04:06.889> it<00:04:06.980> like<00:04:07.130> a<00:04:07.160> pinky<00:04:07.730> color<00:04:08.060> and

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
twice sing it like a pinky color and

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.569 
twice sing it like a pinky color and
that<00:04:08.900> was<00:04:09.019> really<00:04:09.170> how<00:04:09.650> far<00:04:09.680> I<00:04:09.920> wanted<00:04:10.250> to<00:04:10.370> go

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
that was really how far I wanted to go

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:13.030 
that was really how far I wanted to go
because<00:04:11.329> I've<00:04:11.480> heard<00:04:11.750> stories<00:04:12.109> if<00:04:12.410> you<00:04:12.590> use<00:04:12.859> it

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
because I've heard stories if you use it

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.069 
because I've heard stories if you use it
too<00:04:13.220> much<00:04:13.430> it<00:04:14.000> can<00:04:14.180> kind<00:04:14.450> of<00:04:14.480> be<00:04:14.540> lighter<00:04:14.810> than

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
too much it can kind of be lighter than

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:16.930 
too much it can kind of be lighter than
your<00:04:15.230> skin<00:04:15.260> it's<00:04:16.039> never<00:04:16.250> going<00:04:16.370> to<00:04:16.430> be<00:04:16.519> perfect

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
your skin it's never going to be perfect

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.339 
your skin it's never going to be perfect
but<00:04:17.000> it's<00:04:17.150> just<00:04:17.239> a<00:04:17.389> natural<00:04:17.630> light<00:04:18.019> another

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:18.349 
but it's just a natural light another

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:19.629 
but it's just a natural light another
bull<00:04:18.620> light<00:04:18.859> in<00:04:19.099> it

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
bull light in it

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.849 
bull light in it
not<00:04:19.909> as<00:04:19.999> obvious<00:04:20.419> and<00:04:20.629> I<00:04:21.019> am<00:04:21.289> happy<00:04:21.620> with<00:04:21.799> the

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
not as obvious and I am happy with the

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.610 
not as obvious and I am happy with the

results the things you have to know are

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.580 
results the things you have to know are
very<00:04:24.949> crucial<00:04:25.909> the<00:04:26.780> first<00:04:27.020> thing<00:04:27.229> is<00:04:27.379> that<00:04:27.409> you

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
very crucial the first thing is that you

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.399 
very crucial the first thing is that you
cannot<00:04:27.919> use<00:04:28.219> it<00:04:28.249> on<00:04:28.580> fresh<00:04:29.210> self-harm<00:04:29.990> cuts

00:04:30.399 --> 00:04:30.409 
cannot use it on fresh self-harm cuts
