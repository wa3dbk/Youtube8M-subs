lift like this or using a jack or

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:47.979 
lift like this or using a jack or
sometimes<00:00:47.059> you<00:00:47.239> don't<00:00:47.330> even<00:00:47.510> need<00:00:47.690> to<00:00:47.839> lift

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
sometimes you don't even need to lift

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:49.119 
sometimes you don't even need to lift
the<00:00:48.140> car<00:00:48.320> up<00:00:48.350> because<00:00:48.680> there<00:00:48.860> is<00:00:48.949> already

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
the car up because there is already

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:50.890 
the car up because there is already
enough<00:00:49.280> clearance<00:00:50.089> between<00:00:50.360> the<00:00:50.570> ground<00:00:50.720> and

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:50.900 
enough clearance between the ground and

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.690 
enough clearance between the ground and
the<00:00:50.989> bottom<00:00:51.290> of<00:00:51.379> the<00:00:51.500> car

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:54.700 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.120 

during<00:00:55.700> the<00:00:55.790> oil<00:00:56.560> this<00:00:57.560> is<00:00:57.710> the<00:00:57.800> transmission

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.130 
during the oil this is the transmission

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.430 
during the oil this is the transmission
fluid<00:00:58.730> oh<00:00:58.850> okay<00:00:59.720> wouldn't<00:01:00.050> want<00:01:00.170> to<00:01:00.230> drain

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
fluid oh okay wouldn't want to drain

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.990 
fluid oh okay wouldn't want to drain
that

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000

okay<00:01:03.900> so<00:01:04.170> well<00:01:04.559> looks<00:01:04.830> like<00:01:04.890> we're<00:01:05.070> gonna<00:01:05.129> have

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
okay so well looks like we're gonna have

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.130 
okay so well looks like we're gonna have
to<00:01:05.400> take<00:01:05.519> these<00:01:05.760> skid<00:01:06.120> plate<00:01:06.420> here<00:01:06.630> off<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.810> get

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
to take these skid plate here off to get

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.860 
to take these skid plate here off to get
to<00:01:07.290> our<00:01:07.320> oil<00:01:07.470> pan<00:01:08.070> okay<00:01:09.060> wait<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.540> can<00:01:09.690> tell

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:09.870 
to our oil pan okay wait you can tell

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.180 
to our oil pan okay wait you can tell
the<00:01:09.990> difference<00:01:10.170> between<00:01:10.380> where<00:01:11.160> the

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
the difference between where the

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.340 
the difference between where the
transmission<00:01:11.910> fluid<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.300> and<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.780> oil<00:01:12.990> plan

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
transmission fluid is and the oil plan

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.130 
transmission fluid is and the oil plan
is<00:01:13.680> by<00:01:14.550> seeing<00:01:14.880> if<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.180> drive<00:01:15.450> shaft<00:01:15.780> or<00:01:16.050> the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
is by seeing if the drive shaft or the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.410 
is by seeing if the drive shaft or the
drive<00:01:16.410> axles<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.040> connected<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.820> if<00:01:18.150> they

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
drive axles is connected to it if they

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.600 
drive axles is connected to it if they
are<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:19.140> are<00:01:19.470> in<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.770> wrong<00:01:19.920> place<00:01:20.310> that's

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
are you are in the wrong place that's

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.700 
are you are in the wrong place that's
where<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.880> transmission<00:01:21.450> fluid<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:21.869> look<00:01:22.500> for

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
where the transmission fluid is look for

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.560 
where the transmission fluid is look for
the<00:01:22.800> one<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.400> not<00:01:23.580> connected<00:01:25.640> in<00:01:26.640> some

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
the one that is not connected in some

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.030 
the one that is not connected in some
cases<00:01:27.840> you'll<00:01:28.140> have<00:01:28.260> to<00:01:28.380> take<00:01:28.500> off<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.830> skid

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
cases you'll have to take off the skid

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.710 
cases you'll have to take off the skid
plate<00:01:29.280> in<00:01:29.430> order<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.729> get<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.060> oil<00:01:30.360> filter

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
plate in order to get to the oil filter

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.830 
plate in order to get to the oil filter
and<00:01:31.080> the<00:01:31.410> oil<00:01:31.619> pan<00:01:31.890> do<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:32.910> by<00:01:33.060> removing<00:01:33.270> cap

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
and the oil pan do this by removing cap

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.270 
and the oil pan do this by removing cap
screws<00:01:35.030> this<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.360> oil<00:01:36.540> tank

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
screws this is the oil tank

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:46.680 
screws this is the oil tank
position

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.600 

first<00:01:47.690> proceeded<00:01:48.200> to<00:01:48.500> loosen<00:01:49.130> the<00:01:49.190> drain<00:01:49.430> plug

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
first proceeded to loosen the drain plug

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.300 
first proceeded to loosen the drain plug
by<00:01:49.940> using<00:01:50.659> a<00:01:50.840> socket<00:01:51.050> wrench<00:01:51.229> or<00:01:51.530> rash<00:01:51.740> once

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
by using a socket wrench or rash once

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.250 
by using a socket wrench or rash once
it's<00:01:52.490> loose<00:01:52.640> enough<00:01:52.940> to<00:01:53.110> continue<00:01:54.110> with<00:01:54.200> your

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
it's loose enough to continue with your

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.380 
it's loose enough to continue with your
fingers<00:01:54.710> just<00:01:54.950> cannot<00:01:55.340> finish<00:01:55.820> it<00:01:56.060> that<00:01:56.240> way

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
fingers just cannot finish it that way

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.480 
fingers just cannot finish it that way
and<00:01:56.720> one<00:01:57.440> thing<00:01:57.680> you<00:01:57.770> might<00:01:57.920> do<00:01:58.100> to<00:01:58.220> protect
