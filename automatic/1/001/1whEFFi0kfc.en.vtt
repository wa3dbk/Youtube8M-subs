00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:08.450
 Hi I am going to leave you in this video 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.370
 see how to tidy and simple your needle 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.050
 can stick then as you see I have 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.620
 accidentally done alone without 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:18.800
 I already have a film as a basecoat 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:22.999
 applied the nail repair from trind 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.579
 a thin layer and we go as a base coat 

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:30.789
 use this piece of ciaté 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:30.789
 and p-spot in the color 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.339
 mainstage 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.340
 well i'm going to zoom you in a little bit so 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.340
 you can see it well 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.630
 So what you do is you start with 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.090
 nail polish so just open and 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.490
 brush your tassel like on one side 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.840
 so that a drop comes on one side 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.840
 sit and then nothing can 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:09.800
 do you do I have a drop in the 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.800
 one side 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:21.420
 then you put the drop on your nail most of the time 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.670
 alec get away from it and be a part 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.870
 I flatten my brush a little 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.729
 and then I bring him to the end 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:33.350
 and then in a pair 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.350
 iron you bring it forward 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.950
 does not give on the edges well 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.660
 take 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.660
 so and this is a layer 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:57.360
 so descend to one side and most 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:00.770
 the weighing and then careful 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.770
 after an end of your nail deal 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:26.180
 so this is a layer but as you can 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.840
 are not visible on all nails at all 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.870
 opaque 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.920
 so we apply a second layer 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.970
 and you actually do that just for the 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.970
 exactly the same way 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:43.049
 brush the brush well and apply 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.910
 it backwards 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:48.810
 well now it is actually still a bit 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.459
 become easy because you already see where 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.269
 you have your first layer so I am there 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.269
 just go over it 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.140
 make sure you thank you nicely 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:14.090
 cuticles provokes a myth 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:17.930
 comes to that just doesn't look so pretty 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:20.800
 and it is also very bad 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.800
 for your cuticles 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:57.360
 then this is the result after two layers 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.850
 well covering nicely 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.150
 the color is quite a appears 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.830
 so maybe a little fierce 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.400
 a little yes a little 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.980
 easter roll as barry like it says and 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.250
 you just the very nice color 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:16.410
 well what are we going to do now grab one 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.470
 little nail polish remover 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:23.130
 I have such a pump dispenser 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.570
 this is from p2 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.110
 but you can also just get out and about 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:30.000
 from a container and a very small one 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.460
 brush I have 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.980
 and with that you can still if you still 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.660
 what you have on your edges or you 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:40.970
 think from the captured still not very 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.970
 very nice then you can take it away 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:48.920
 so I will do that for a while 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.920
 make lines even sharper 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:06.289
 if you have cleaned all the edges 

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:09.199
 then you see you next to you look neat and tidy 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:11.689
 neatly varnished and we actually have to 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:14.719
 just one more step and that 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:17.899
 is naturally top coat application and top 

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:19.909
 coat you apply to the shelf life of 

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:21.409
 to extend your nail polish and to be the one 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:23.719
 give it a nice shine 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:27.039
 no this nail polish shines very much already 

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:27.039
 found himself as you can see 

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:31.399
 but for the shelf life is a top 

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:33.529
 coat is always desirable 

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:35.539
 well you actually apply top coat 

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:37.279
 same way on one side 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:39.709
 get off 

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:43.759
 so there is a droplet on one side 

00:05:39.709 --> 00:05:45.589
 and you actually put it 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:46.999
 over your nail 

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:49.879
 your nail polish is not yet completely 

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:51.439
 to be dry but don't do it too 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:53.389
 little top coat another piece 

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:56.889
 indents 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:56.889
 and that is not the intention of course 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:26.730
 so and then you are completely done with you 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:29.610
 manicure and then this is it 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:32.400
 result with 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:39.090
 yes with only a few trind products 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:41.220
 nail repair as the basis for the ciaté paintpot 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:44.280
 in 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:49.770
 I'll forget mainstage as 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:55.080
 I should say base coat or base lacquer then 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:57.330
 nail polish remover and a brush and over 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:01.530
 finish it 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:03.090
 top coat well this was a how to of how 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:05.340
 it is best to paint your nails 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.840
 I hope you enjoyed it and and 

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.460
 what to have 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.870
 thanks for looking and see you 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.870
