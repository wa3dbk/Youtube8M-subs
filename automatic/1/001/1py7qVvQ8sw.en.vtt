00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
more information on the other maps as we

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.230 
more information on the other maps as we
get<00:03:23.690> closer<00:03:23.900> to<00:03:24.020> release<00:03:24.350> awesome<00:03:24.950> so<00:03:25.400> now<00:03:25.580> as

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.910 
when you're no designing it for the
spies<00:03:29.810> thinking<00:03:30.290> of<00:03:30.350> all<00:03:30.470> the<00:03:30.590> nooks<00:03:30.800> and

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
spies thinking of all the nooks and

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.290 
spies thinking of all the nooks and
crannies<00:03:31.250> that<00:03:31.280> they<00:03:31.550> can<00:03:31.670> climb<00:03:31.850> up<00:03:32.060> and<00:03:32.240> jump

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
crannies that they can climb up and jump

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.830 
crannies that they can climb up and jump
out<00:03:32.630> of<00:03:32.660> and<00:03:33.110> I<00:03:33.290> mean<00:03:34.030> we<00:03:35.030> basically<00:03:35.300> start<00:03:35.660> off

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
out of and I mean we basically start off

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.740 
out of and I mean we basically start off
designing<00:03:36.380> a<00:03:36.590> shooter<00:03:37.520> friendly<00:03:38.060> Merck<00:03:38.360> place

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
designing a shooter friendly Merck place

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.330 
designing a shooter friendly Merck place
and<00:03:39.020> then<00:03:39.170> we<00:03:39.350> add<00:03:39.590> all<00:03:39.620> of<00:03:40.040> this

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
and then we add all of this

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.150 
and then we add all of this
infrastructure<00:03:41.060> and<00:03:41.630> extra<00:03:41.930> spy<00:03:42.230> roots<00:03:42.560> to

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
infrastructure and extra spy roots to

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.160 
infrastructure and extra spy roots to
the<00:03:43.190> maps<00:03:43.490> it's<00:03:43.760> a<00:03:43.940> fun<00:03:44.270> design<00:03:44.570> process<00:03:44.960> for

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
the maps it's a fun design process for

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.870 
the maps it's a fun design process for
us<00:03:45.260> what's<00:03:46.040> your<00:03:46.190> favorite<00:03:46.610> thing<00:03:46.670> about

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
us what's your favorite thing about

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.910 
us what's your favorite thing about
being<00:03:47.270> a<00:03:47.360> level<00:03:47.600> designer<00:03:47.920> honestly

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
being a level designer honestly

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.140 
being a level designer honestly
especially<00:03:49.910> in<00:03:50.030> this<00:03:50.240> game<00:03:50.510> I<00:03:50.990> think<00:03:51.710> the

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
especially in this game I think the

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.420 
especially in this game I think the
environment<00:03:53.150> is<00:03:53.330> the<00:03:53.720> spies<00:03:53.990> best<00:03:54.500> gadget<00:03:55.160> you

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
environment is the spies best gadget you

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.310 
environment is the spies best gadget you
know<00:03:55.610> the<00:03:55.760> map<00:03:55.940> really<00:03:56.480> well<00:03:56.660> you're<00:03:56.930> super

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
know the map really well you're super

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.130 
know the map really well you're super
powerful<00:03:57.620> as<00:03:57.890> a<00:03:57.920> spy<00:03:58.280> and<00:03:58.520> I<00:03:59.510> think<00:03:59.960> that's

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
powerful as a spy and I think that's

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.600 
powerful as a spy and I think that's
been<00:04:00.380> the<00:04:00.410> coolest<00:04:00.650> thing<00:04:01.010> for<00:04:01.220> me<00:04:01.340> is<00:04:01.370> that

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
been the coolest thing for me is that

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.480 
been the coolest thing for me is that
the<00:04:02.270> levels<00:04:03.110> are<00:04:03.260> such<00:04:03.500> an<00:04:03.650> integral<00:04:03.980> part<00:04:04.160> of

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.490 
the levels are such an integral part of

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.730 
the levels are such an integral part of
the<00:04:04.550> spy<00:04:04.790> experience<00:04:05.380> what<00:04:06.380> are<00:04:06.470> you<00:04:06.530> most

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:06.740 
the spy experience what are you most

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.430 
the spy experience what are you most
excited<00:04:06.950> for<00:04:07.250> fans<00:04:07.520> to<00:04:07.700> see<00:04:08.080> for<00:04:09.080> me<00:04:09.230> I<00:04:09.260> think

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
excited for fans to see for me I think

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.190 
excited for fans to see for me I think
I'm<00:04:09.860> most<00:04:10.160> excited<00:04:10.400> to<00:04:10.730> watch<00:04:11.270> the<00:04:11.600> old<00:04:11.810> fans

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
I'm most excited to watch the old fans

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.610 
I'm most excited to watch the old fans
play<00:04:13.070> the<00:04:13.400> classic<00:04:13.850> mode<00:04:14.060> and<00:04:14.360> then<00:04:15.290> try<00:04:15.590> the

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
play the classic mode and then try the

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.320 
play the classic mode and then try the
new<00:04:15.890> black<00:04:16.130> list<00:04:16.400> mode<00:04:16.610> I<00:04:16.850> think<00:04:17.030> we're<00:04:17.180> really

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 
new black list mode I think we're really

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.600 
new black list mode I think we're really
going<00:04:17.540> to<00:04:17.630> hook<00:04:17.750> them<00:04:17.960> with<00:04:18.350> a<00:04:18.650> game<00:04:19.280> mode<00:04:19.460> that

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:19.610 
going to hook them with a game mode that

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.640 
going to hook them with a game mode that
has<00:04:19.790> the<00:04:20.030> same<00:04:20.390> intensity<00:04:21.230> the<00:04:21.470> same

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
has the same intensity the same

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.950 
has the same intensity the same
emotional<00:04:22.190> sort<00:04:22.520> of<00:04:22.640> need<00:04:23.510> to<00:04:23.750> not<00:04:23.930> be

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
emotional sort of need to not be

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.660 
emotional sort of need to not be
discovered<00:04:24.680> when<00:04:24.860> you're<00:04:25.010> on<00:04:25.100> the<00:04:25.130> spy<00:04:25.430> team

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670 
discovered when you're on the spy team

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.570 
discovered when you're on the spy team
and<00:04:25.910> the<00:04:26.000> same<00:04:26.240> sort<00:04:26.570> of<00:04:26.600> like<00:04:26.920> hunter<00:04:27.920> seeker

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
and the same sort of like hunter seeker

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.820 
and the same sort of like hunter seeker
feeling<00:04:29.030> on<00:04:29.150> the<00:04:29.240> Merc<00:04:29.420> side<00:04:29.660> only<00:04:30.650> at<00:04:30.800> a

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
feeling on the Merc side only at a

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.860 
feeling on the Merc side only at a
faster<00:04:31.310> pace<00:04:31.340> in<00:04:31.970> a<00:04:32.120> different<00:04:32.750> environment

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
faster pace in a different environment

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.510 
faster pace in a different environment
when<00:04:33.440> you<00:04:33.560> played<00:04:33.800> in<00:04:33.950> black<00:04:34.130> list<00:04:34.370> mode
