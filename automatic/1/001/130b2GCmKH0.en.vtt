this<00:02:30.900> year<00:02:31.080> was<00:02:31.200> struggle<00:02:32.130> we<00:02:32.700> really<00:02:32.910> had<00:02:33.090> to

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
this year was struggle we really had to

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.059 
this year was struggle we really had to
make<00:02:33.240> a<00:02:33.360> lot<00:02:33.569> of<00:02:33.599> changes<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.380> you<00:02:34.950> know

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
really didn't think that was gonna

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.180

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.650 
put it into the game it was it was just
great<00:03:15.270> I<00:03:15.900> was<00:03:16.349> yelling<00:03:16.590> about<00:03:17.550> entire<00:03:17.970> game<00:03:18.330> I

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
great I was yelling about entire game I

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.900 
great I was yelling about entire game I
might<00:03:18.840> lose<00:03:19.050> my<00:03:19.200> voice<00:03:19.349> tonight<00:03:19.770> but<00:03:20.190> it<00:03:20.700> was

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
might lose my voice tonight but it was

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.520 
might lose my voice tonight but it was
so<00:03:21.060> fun<00:03:21.300> to<00:03:21.330> watch<00:03:21.540> I<00:03:21.900> think<00:03:22.200> we're<00:03:22.379> at<00:03:22.500> our

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
so fun to watch I think we're at our

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.229 
so fun to watch I think we're at our
best<00:03:22.680> when<00:03:22.980> we're<00:03:23.129> playing<00:03:23.280> you<00:03:23.670> know<00:03:23.760> team

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
best when we're playing you know team

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.900 
best when we're playing you know team
offense<00:03:24.930> and<00:03:25.170> defense<00:03:25.500> and<00:03:25.770> I<00:03:25.980> think<00:03:26.489> you<00:03:26.790> know

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
offense and defense and I think you know

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.460 
offense and defense and I think you know
we<00:03:27.209> were<00:03:27.239> offensive<00:03:27.599> ly<00:03:27.870> stagnant<00:03:28.349> in<00:03:28.410> the

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
we were offensive ly stagnant in the

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.930 
we were offensive ly stagnant in the
beginning<00:03:28.830> but<00:03:29.010> it<00:03:29.190> was<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.430> matter<00:03:29.550> of<00:03:29.670> just

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
beginning but it was the matter of just

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:44.930 
beginning but it was the matter of just
common<00:03:30.150> down<00:03:30.420> and<00:03:30.780> getting<00:03:31.140> through<00:03:31.319> it<00:03:43.940> I

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
common down and getting through it I

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.740 
common down and getting through it I
think<00:03:45.540> when<00:03:45.890> when<00:03:46.890> you<00:03:47.069> get<00:03:47.370> to<00:03:47.819> the<00:03:48.420> point

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
think when when you get to the point

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.690 
think when when you get to the point
where<00:03:48.930> we<00:03:49.080> are<00:03:49.260> and<00:03:49.709> what<00:03:50.310> we've<00:03:50.459> done

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
where we are and what we've done

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.759 
where we are and what we've done
obviously<00:03:51.030> it's<00:03:51.480> it's<00:03:52.019> important<00:03:52.620> it's

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
obviously it's it's important it's

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.210 
obviously it's it's important it's
significant<00:03:53.370> it's<00:03:53.660> it's<00:03:54.660> something<00:03:54.870> that

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
significant it's it's something that

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.920 
significant it's it's something that
it's<00:03:56.220> really<00:03:56.340> incredibly<00:03:57.000> hard<00:03:57.269> to<00:03:57.390> do<00:03:57.540> and<00:03:57.780> if

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
it's really incredibly hard to do and if

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.479 
it's really incredibly hard to do and if
it<00:03:58.080> wasn't<00:03:58.290> a<00:03:58.560> lot<00:03:58.769> of<00:03:58.860> other<00:03:58.980> people<00:03:59.250> would<00:03:59.340> do

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
it wasn't a lot of other people would do

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:04.399 
it wasn't a lot of other people would do
it<00:03:59.610> you<00:04:01.099> know<00:04:02.099> I'm<00:04:02.340> not<00:04:02.519> I'm<00:04:02.909> not<00:04:03.239> big<00:04:04.140> on

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:04.409 
it you know I'm not I'm not big on

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:07.550 
it you know I'm not I'm not big on
comparisons<00:04:05.280> you<00:04:05.790> know<00:04:05.940> I<00:04:06.569> just<00:04:07.140> like<00:04:07.319> to

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
comparisons you know I just like to

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.160

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
we played against we've done pretty well
