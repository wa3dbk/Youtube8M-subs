warfare<00:00:38.790> 2<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:40.550> I'm<00:00:41.550> trying<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.000> figure<00:00:42.270> out

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
warfare 2 and I'm trying to figure out

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.279 
warfare 2 and I'm trying to figure out
ways<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.660> defend<00:00:43.170> myself<00:00:43.550> so<00:00:44.550> I've<00:00:44.700> decided<00:00:44.850> to

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
ways to defend myself so I've decided to

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.799 
ways to defend myself so I've decided to
maybe<00:00:46.289> decide<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.190> no<00:00:47.309> pickup<00:00:48.030> at<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.270> 8<00:00:48.480> 12

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
maybe decide you no pickup at a 8 12

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.810 
maybe decide you no pickup at a 8 12
which<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.230> deemed<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.890> pretty<00:00:50.160> cheap<00:00:50.520> shotgun

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
which I deemed is a pretty cheap shotgun

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.200 
which I deemed is a pretty cheap shotgun
a<00:00:51.030> long<00:00:51.270> time<00:00:51.539> ago<00:00:52.520> decided<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.730> use<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.090> this

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
a long time ago decided to use it this

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.360 
a long time ago decided to use it this
time<00:00:54.270> around<00:00:54.629> maybe<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.320> can<00:00:55.559> get<00:00:55.710> close<00:00:56.100> i'm

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
time around maybe I can get close i'm

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.410 
time around maybe I can get close i'm
using<00:00:56.699> marathon<00:00:58.160> stopping<00:00:59.160> power<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.850> ninja

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
using marathon stopping power and ninja

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.389 
using marathon stopping power and ninja
you<00:01:01.410> know<00:01:01.500> just<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:01.890> can<00:01:01.980> get<00:01:02.160> nice<00:01:02.370> and

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
you know just so I can get nice and

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.880 
you know just so I can get nice and
close<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.570> guys<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.989> are<00:01:04.049> you

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
close to the to the guys that are you

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.830 
close to the to the guys that are you
know<00:01:05.040> new<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.670> battalion<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.390> figured<00:01:06.659> if<00:01:06.750> I

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
know new to battalion and I figured if I

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.570 
know new to battalion and I figured if I
get<00:01:06.990> close<00:01:07.170> enough<00:01:07.470> maybe<00:01:07.979> it'd<00:01:08.100> be<00:01:08.159> harder

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
get close enough maybe it'd be harder

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.940 
get close enough maybe it'd be harder
for<00:01:08.610> them<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.880> move<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.560> so<00:01:10.560> that's<00:01:10.710> kind<00:01:10.920> of

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
for them to move to so that's kind of

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.109 
for them to move to so that's kind of
the<00:01:11.010> strategy<00:01:11.460> i'm<00:01:11.549> going<00:01:11.790> with<00:01:11.909> in<00:01:12.030> this

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
the strategy i'm going with in this

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.789 
the strategy i'm going with in this
round<00:01:12.390> you're<00:01:12.780> going<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:12.960> see<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.200> lot<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.530> the
