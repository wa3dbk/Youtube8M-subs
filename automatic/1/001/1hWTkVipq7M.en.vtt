to<00:03:42.229> show<00:03:42.409> ya<00:03:43.209> it<00:03:44.209> would<00:03:44.449> just<00:03:44.599> be

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
to show ya it would just be

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.390 
to show ya it would just be
straightforward<00:03:45.169> the<00:03:45.590> same<00:03:45.829> as<00:03:46.010> what<00:03:46.159> you<00:03:46.190> did

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
straightforward the same as what you did

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.069 
straightforward the same as what you did
before<00:03:46.549> but<00:03:47.239> you<00:03:47.359> just<00:03:47.540> have<00:03:47.750> to<00:03:47.959> be<00:03:48.049> extra

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
before but you just have to be extra

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.920 
before but you just have to be extra
careful<00:03:48.440> because<00:03:49.069> and<00:03:49.519> with<00:03:50.329> liquid<00:03:50.780> you

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
careful because and with liquid you

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.319 
careful because and with liquid you
haven't<00:03:51.260> got<00:03:51.379> as<00:03:51.500> much<00:03:51.709> in<00:03:52.129> scope<00:03:52.699> to<00:03:52.940> go<00:03:53.090> wrong

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
haven't got as much in scope to go wrong

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:55.420 
haven't got as much in scope to go wrong
so<00:03:54.019> we've<00:03:54.169> liquid<00:03:54.620> I<00:03:54.709> just<00:03:54.889> show<00:03:55.069> you<00:03:55.099> on<00:03:55.310> the

so we've liquid I just show you on the

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.030 
so we've liquid I just show you on the
either<00:03:55.579> already<00:03:56.150> done<00:03:56.449> earlier<00:03:56.870> you<00:03:57.560> just<00:03:57.799> go

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
either already done earlier you just go

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.319 
either already done earlier you just go
straight<00:03:58.519> across<00:03:58.970> like<00:03:59.510> that<00:04:00.280> and<00:04:01.280> painter<00:04:02.180> um

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
straight across like that and painter um

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.649 
straight across like that and painter um
now<00:04:02.900> that<00:04:02.930> the<00:04:03.650> good<00:04:03.859> side<00:04:04.099> with<00:04:04.310> liquid<00:04:04.790> em<00:04:05.060> as

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:05.659 
now that the good side with liquid em as

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:09.129 
now that the good side with liquid em as
opposed<00:04:06.260> to<00:04:06.560> the<00:04:06.739> N<00:04:07.040> pencil<00:04:07.790> is<00:04:08.030> that<00:04:08.900> the

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:09.139 
opposed to the N pencil is that the
