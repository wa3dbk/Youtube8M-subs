00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.070 
a and C which is big because it's pretty
much<00:01:36.700> like<00:01:36.760> a<00:01:36.909> three<00:01:37.210> cap<00:01:37.390> except<00:01:37.780> it's<00:01:37.960> like<00:01:38.049> a

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
much like a three cap except it's like a

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.899 
much like a three cap except it's like a
two<00:01:38.409> cap<00:01:38.710> but<00:01:39.070> you're<00:01:39.189> still<00:01:39.340> gaining<00:01:39.580> two

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
two cap but you're still gaining two

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:41.190 
two cap but you're still gaining two
points<00:01:40.270> every<00:01:40.450> five<00:01:40.600> seconds<00:01:40.930> instead<00:01:41.140> of

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
points every five seconds instead of

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.200 
points every five seconds instead of
three<00:01:41.470> so<00:01:41.920> it's<00:01:42.040> better<00:01:42.220> at<00:01:42.369> holding<00:01:42.460> it's

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
three so it's better at holding it's

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.969 
three so it's better at holding it's
better<00:01:43.360> holding<00:01:43.720> on<00:01:43.810> to<00:01:44.020> cap<00:01:44.260> losing<00:01:44.650> alpha

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
better holding on to cap losing alpha

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:46.560 
better holding on to cap losing alpha
with<00:01:45.189> him<00:01:45.340> having<00:01:45.610> no<00:01:45.640> flags<00:01:45.970> in<00:01:46.150> him<00:01:46.299> having

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
with him having no flags in him having

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.390 
with him having no flags in him having
one<00:01:46.750> flag<00:01:46.990> so<00:01:47.320> at<00:01:47.380> this<00:01:47.500> point<00:01:47.680> he's<00:01:47.979> gonna<00:01:48.159> go

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
one flag so at this point he's gonna go

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.280 
one flag so at this point he's gonna go
a<00:01:48.640> because<00:01:49.210> he<00:01:49.240> pretty<00:01:49.479> much<00:01:49.689> spot<00:01:49.990> on<00:01:50.020> there

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
a because he pretty much spot on there

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.710 
a because he pretty much spot on there
cuz<00:01:50.409> I<00:01:50.470> kind<00:01:50.710> of<00:01:50.770> messed<00:01:50.920> up<00:01:51.070> spawns<00:01:51.600> chance<00:01:52.600> to

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
cuz I kind of messed up spawns chance to

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.060 
cuz I kind of messed up spawns chance to
name<00:01:52.900> me<00:01:53.080> there<00:01:53.229> was<00:01:53.320> a<00:01:53.409> film<00:01:53.619> day<00:01:53.770> and<00:01:53.890> then<00:01:53.979> I

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
name me there was a film day and then I

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.370 
name me there was a film day and then I
do<00:01:54.130> need<00:01:54.460> him<00:01:54.580> off<00:01:54.729> a<00:01:54.909> so<00:01:55.840> at<00:01:55.930> this<00:01:56.020> point<00:01:56.200> I'm

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
do need him off a so at this point I'm

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.960 
do need him off a so at this point I'm
gonna<00:01:56.530> have<00:01:56.740> a<00:01:56.770> three<00:01:57.340> cap<00:01:57.580> I'm<00:01:57.729> gonna<00:01:57.880> be

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970

getting<00:01:58.240> B<00:01:58.570> so<00:01:59.170> I'm<00:01:59.380> gonna<00:01:59.500> try<00:01:59.740> to<00:01:59.770> stack<00:02:00.490> up

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
getting B so I'm gonna try to stack up

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.819 
getting B so I'm gonna try to stack up
on<00:02:00.909> the<00:02:01.119> secured<00:02:01.600> maintain<00:02:02.079> I<00:02:02.200> want<00:02:02.500> to<00:02:02.590> stack

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:02.829 
on the secured maintain I want to stack

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:04.230 
on the secured maintain I want to stack
up<00:02:02.860> on<00:02:03.130> this<00:02:03.369> side<00:02:03.579> but<00:02:03.700> he's<00:02:03.820> gonna<00:02:03.970> spawn

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
up on this side but he's gonna spawn

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.210 
up on this side but he's gonna spawn
there<00:02:04.479> originally<00:02:04.960> because<00:02:05.530> that's<00:02:05.829> where<00:02:06.189> I

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
there originally because that's where I

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.880 
there originally because that's where I
spawn<00:02:06.909> yeah<00:02:07.390> we<00:02:07.780> actually<00:02:07.990> did<00:02:08.379> spawn<00:02:08.649> there

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
spawn yeah we actually did spawn there

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.649 
spawn yeah we actually did spawn there
because<00:02:09.429> I<00:02:09.549> was<00:02:09.640> empty<00:02:09.939> when<00:02:10.060> he<00:02:10.119> spawned<00:02:10.509> up

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:10.659 
because I was empty when he spawned up

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:12.089 
because I was empty when he spawned up
and<00:02:11.110> then<00:02:11.799> I<00:02:11.829> do

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
and then I do

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.670 
and then I do
kill<00:02:12.280> them<00:02:12.569> so<00:02:13.569> the<00:02:13.719> side<00:02:13.930> that<00:02:14.109> I'm<00:02:14.349> on<00:02:14.650> right

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
kill them so the side that I'm on right

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.009 
kill them so the side that I'm on right
now<00:02:15.249> I<00:02:15.489> want<00:02:15.700> to<00:02:15.730> stack<00:02:15.969> up<00:02:16.209> I<00:02:16.329> want<00:02:16.510> to<00:02:16.599> force

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
now I want to stack up I want to force

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:18.809 
now I want to stack up I want to force
them<00:02:17.200> by<00:02:17.379> bird's<00:02:17.680> nest<00:02:18.010> or<00:02:18.189> whatever<00:02:18.459> your

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
them by bird's nest or whatever your

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.610 
them by bird's nest or whatever your
cots<00:02:19.150> are<00:02:19.359> like<00:02:19.629> that<00:02:19.810> second<00:02:20.170> hard<00:02:20.349> point

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
cots are like that second hard point

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.470 
cots are like that second hard point
like<00:02:20.920> I<00:02:21.040> wanted<00:02:21.400> to<00:02:21.549> spawn<00:02:21.849> in<00:02:21.969> that<00:02:22.120> area

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
like I wanted to spawn in that area

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.449 
like I wanted to spawn in that area
because<00:02:23.109> you<00:02:23.230> can<00:02:23.379> control<00:02:23.560> spawns<00:02:24.040> easier

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
because you can control spawns easier

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.059 
because you can control spawns easier
that<00:02:24.639> way<00:02:24.819> and<00:02:25.209> I<00:02:25.870> feel<00:02:26.230> like<00:02:26.349> you<00:02:26.499> have<00:02:26.620> easier

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
that way and I feel like you have easier

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.780 
that way and I feel like you have easier
kills<00:02:27.400> like<00:02:28.060> if<00:02:28.359> he<00:02:28.569> jumps<00:02:28.900> on<00:02:28.989> a<00:02:29.019> flag<00:02:29.319> so<00:02:30.280> as

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
kills like if he jumps on a flag so as

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.780 
kills like if he jumps on a flag so as
you<00:02:31.000> see<00:02:31.239> he's<00:02:31.450> gonna<00:02:31.599> jump<00:02:31.930> see<00:02:32.170> I<00:02:32.439> do<00:02:33.370> kill

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
you see he's gonna jump see I do kill

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.940 
you see he's gonna jump see I do kill
him<00:02:33.879> at<00:02:34.120> this<00:02:34.629> point<00:02:34.900> I<00:02:34.989> have<00:02:35.139> a<00:02:35.170> three<00:02:35.469> cap<00:02:35.680> I'm

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
him at this point I have a three cap I'm

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.410 
him at this point I have a three cap I'm
pretty<00:02:36.310> much<00:02:36.430> controlling<00:02:36.879> the<00:02:36.969> game<00:02:37.120> I'm<00:02:37.299> up

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420

not<00:03:16.900> getting<00:03:17.199> three<00:03:17.439> cap<00:03:17.650> my<00:03:18.489> the<00:03:19.239> mindset<00:03:19.689> I

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
not getting three cap my the mindset I

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.319 
not getting three cap my the mindset I
have<00:03:20.079> is<00:03:20.409> just<00:03:20.799> to<00:03:20.949> ply<00:03:21.159> to<00:03:21.220> not<00:03:21.669> get<00:03:21.849> three<00:03:22.120> cap

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
have is just to ply to not get three cap

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:23.759 
have is just to ply to not get three cap
don't<00:03:22.569> get<00:03:22.780> three<00:03:23.019> cap<00:03:23.229> that's<00:03:23.409> the<00:03:23.560> worst

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
don't get three cap that's the worst

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.439 
don't get three cap that's the worst
situation<00:03:24.310> you<00:03:24.400> can<00:03:24.549> put<00:03:24.669> yourself<00:03:24.759> in<00:03:25.120> and

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:25.449 
situation you can put yourself in and

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:27.539 
situation you can put yourself in and
Dom<00:03:25.599> singles<00:03:26.079> like<00:03:26.620> that's<00:03:26.889> the<00:03:27.129> worst<00:03:27.340> thing

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
Dom singles like that's the worst thing

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.360 
Dom singles like that's the worst thing
because<00:03:27.819> you're<00:03:27.939> losing<00:03:28.060> three<00:03:28.449> points<00:03:28.840> every

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
because you're losing three points every

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.580 
because you're losing three points every
five<00:03:30.370> seconds<00:03:30.849> and<00:03:31.060> 32<00:03:31.659> points<00:03:31.989> every<00:03:32.259> minute

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
five seconds and 32 points every minute

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.689 
five seconds and 32 points every minute
and<00:03:33.239> it's<00:03:34.239> not<00:03:34.359> the<00:03:34.479> best<00:03:34.689> thing<00:03:34.900> but<00:03:35.579> as<00:03:36.579> you

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:36.699 
and it's not the best thing but as you

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:38.369 
and it's not the best thing but as you
see<00:03:36.879> I'm<00:03:37.150> kind<00:03:37.329> of<00:03:37.479> like<00:03:37.629> I'm<00:03:37.840> just<00:03:38.139> playing

and I believe I actually get raped there

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.319 
and I believe I actually get raped there
kind<00:04:07.840> of<00:04:08.310> but<00:04:09.310> at<00:04:09.430> this<00:04:09.609> point<00:04:09.909> the<00:04:10.120> game's

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
kind of but at this point the game's

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:11.520 
kind of but at this point the game's
pretty<00:04:10.629> much<00:04:10.810> out<00:04:10.959> of<00:04:11.109> hand

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
pretty much out of hand

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.219 
pretty much out of hand
it's<00:04:11.709> like<00:04:12.129> mathematically<00:04:12.909> over<00:04:13.209> for<00:04:14.139> the

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:14.229 
it's like mathematically over for the

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:16.770 
it's like mathematically over for the
most<00:04:14.439> part<00:04:15.030> usually<00:04:16.030> at<00:04:16.120> this<00:04:16.209> point<00:04:16.329> I<00:04:16.599> would

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
most part usually at this point I would

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.140 
most part usually at this point I would
just<00:04:16.959> shut<00:04:17.530> down<00:04:17.709> or<00:04:18.250> like<00:04:18.519> just<00:04:18.549> put<00:04:18.909> down<00:04:19.000> my

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
just shut down or like just put down my

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.849 
just shut down or like just put down my
controller<00:04:19.570> honestly<00:04:20.380> because<00:04:20.650> it's

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
controller honestly because it's

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.129 
controller honestly because it's
mathematically<00:04:21.039> over<00:04:21.669> and<00:04:21.789> I<00:04:21.849> feel

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
mathematically over and I feel

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:23.510 
mathematically over and I feel
there's<00:04:22.289> no<00:04:22.469> point<00:04:22.710> in<00:04:22.830> playing<00:04:22.949> once<00:04:23.340> it's

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
there's no point in playing once it's

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.279 
there's no point in playing once it's
over<00:04:23.849> that's<00:04:24.120> just<00:04:24.360> them<00:04:24.479> I<00:04:24.569> said<00:04:24.780> I<00:04:24.810> have<00:04:25.020> once

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
over that's just them I said I have once

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:27.860 
over that's just them I said I have once
it's<00:04:25.469> over<00:04:25.650> I<00:04:26.039> just<00:04:26.460> don't<00:04:27.210> feel<00:04:27.389> like<00:04:27.449> a<00:04:27.599> point

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
it's over I just don't feel like a point

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.779 
it's over I just don't feel like a point
in<00:04:27.960> play<00:04:28.080> and<00:04:28.139> that's<00:04:28.259> me<00:04:28.560> some<00:04:29.400> people<00:04:29.580> may

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789 
in play and that's me some people may

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:31.820 
in play and that's me some people may
feel<00:04:30.270> like<00:04:30.449> playing<00:04:30.719> some<00:04:31.259> don't<00:04:31.499> I<00:04:31.620> just

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
feel like playing some don't I just

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:32.959 
feel like playing some don't I just
think<00:04:31.949> it's<00:04:32.069> like<00:04:32.189> a<00:04:32.279> waste<00:04:32.460> of<00:04:32.580> time<00:04:32.729> for<00:04:32.939> both

00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:32.969 
think it's like a waste of time for both

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:35.119 
think it's like a waste of time for both
people<00:04:33.469> there's<00:04:34.469> no<00:04:34.590> why<00:04:34.680> I<00:04:34.710> kept<00:04:34.949> playing

00:04:35.119 --> 00:04:35.129 
people there's no why I kept playing

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:36.559 
people there's no why I kept playing
here<00:04:35.400> it<00:04:35.520> was<00:04:35.610> good<00:04:35.789> to<00:04:35.879> kind<00:04:36.090> of<00:04:36.150> show<00:04:36.360> like

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:36.569 
here it was good to kind of show like

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:38.149 
here it was good to kind of show like
you<00:04:36.719> know<00:04:36.749> not<00:04:36.990> to<00:04:37.139> get<00:04:37.259> cocky<00:04:37.529> after<00:04:37.949> first

00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:38.159 
you know not to get cocky after first

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:39.230 
you know not to get cocky after first
rap<00:04:38.370> and<00:04:38.490> I<00:04:38.520> felt<00:04:38.699> like<00:04:38.759> it<00:04:38.879> was<00:04:38.969> a<00:04:39.029> pretty

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
rap and I felt like it was a pretty

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.290 
rap and I felt like it was a pretty
decent<00:04:39.419> game<00:04:39.990> play<00:04:40.199> for<00:04:40.650> the<00:04:41.009> second<00:04:41.310> side<00:04:41.460> or

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
decent game play for the second side or

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.540 
decent game play for the second side or
not<00:04:42.479> first<00:04:42.719> side<00:04:43.139> I<00:04:43.169> got<00:04:43.499> cocky<00:04:43.710> not<00:04:44.039> math<00:04:44.279> and

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
not first side I got cocky not math and

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.850 
not first side I got cocky not math and
then<00:04:45.180> second<00:04:45.779> side<00:04:45.960> you<00:04:46.349> know<00:04:46.469> it<00:04:46.710> was<00:04:46.800> a

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
then second side you know it was a

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.709 
then second side you know it was a
decent<00:04:47.009> game<00:04:47.279> play<00:04:47.520> so<00:04:47.999> I<00:04:48.060> decided<00:04:48.389> to<00:04:48.569> keep

00:04:48.709 --> 00:04:48.719 
decent game play so I decided to keep

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:50.059 
decent game play so I decided to keep
playing<00:04:49.020> but<00:04:49.289> like<00:04:49.379> I<00:04:49.499> said<00:04:49.560> I<00:04:49.740> would<00:04:49.860> normally

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:50.069 
playing but like I said I would normally

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:54.080 
playing but like I said I would normally
put<00:04:50.550> down<00:04:50.849> my<00:04:50.969> controller<00:04:51.389> this<00:04:52.110> kid<00:04:52.639> was<00:04:53.639> not

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
put down my controller this kid was not

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.050 
put down my controller this kid was not
that<00:04:54.300> good<00:04:54.719> in<00:04:54.930> my<00:04:55.110> opinion<00:04:55.199> when<00:04:55.800> I<00:04:55.830> tried<00:04:56.370> but

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
that good in my opinion when I tried but

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.089 
that good in my opinion when I tried but
he<00:04:57.120> was<00:04:57.419> better<00:04:57.689> than<00:04:57.900> I<00:04:58.259> you<00:04:58.409> know<00:04:58.680> gave<00:04:58.889> him

00:04:59.089 --> 00:04:59.099 
he was better than I you know gave him

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:01.010 
he was better than I you know gave him
the<00:04:59.219> respect<00:04:59.610> for<00:04:59.789> so<00:05:00.120> I<00:05:00.150> got<00:05:00.360> props<00:05:00.629> to<00:05:00.779> him<00:05:00.900> he

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
the respect for so I got props to him he

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.209 
the respect for so I got props to him he
is<00:05:01.050> a<00:05:01.139> little<00:05:01.289> better<00:05:01.469> than<00:05:01.740> I<00:05:01.800> thought<00:05:01.979> he<00:05:02.039> was

00:05:02.209 --> 00:05:02.219 
is a little better than I thought he was

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:04.850 
is a little better than I thought he was
gonna<00:05:02.310> be<00:05:02.840> so<00:05:03.840> this<00:05:03.990> point<00:05:04.199> it's<00:05:04.409> definitely

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
gonna be so this point it's definitely

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.350 
gonna be so this point it's definitely
mathematically<00:05:05.460> over<00:05:05.669> he<00:05:05.789> can't<00:05:06.000> come<00:05:06.180> back

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
mathematically over he can't come back

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.480 
mathematically over he can't come back
at<00:05:06.719> this<00:05:06.810> point<00:05:07.020> I<00:05:07.169> won<00:05:07.349> the<00:05:07.469> match<00:05:07.680> because<00:05:08.219> I

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
at this point I won the match because I

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.119 
at this point I won the match because I
did<00:05:08.669> win<00:05:08.849> the<00:05:08.939> first<00:05:09.150> two<00:05:09.360> maps<00:05:09.560> by<00:05:10.560> I<00:05:10.590> think<00:05:11.069> I

00:05:11.119 --> 00:05:11.129 
did win the first two maps by I think I

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:13.579 
did win the first two maps by I think I
pretty<00:05:11.250> decent<00:05:11.699> amount<00:05:12.020> it<00:05:13.020> was<00:05:13.139> like<00:05:13.289> 20

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:13.589 
pretty decent amount it was like 20

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:15.829 
pretty decent amount it was like 20
seconds<00:05:13.979> left<00:05:14.099> Dom<00:05:14.819> I<00:05:15.089> think<00:05:15.150> on<00:05:15.449> this<00:05:15.599> game

00:05:15.829 --> 00:05:15.839 
seconds left Dom I think on this game

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:18.290 
seconds left Dom I think on this game
mathematically<00:05:16.469> over<00:05:16.740> is<00:05:16.860> like<00:05:16.889> about<00:05:17.279> 171<00:05:18.180> or

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
mathematically over is like about 171 or

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.269 
mathematically over is like about 171 or
172<00:05:19.020> and<00:05:19.469> the<00:05:19.560> other<00:05:19.740> games<00:05:19.979> runs<00:05:20.159> like

00:05:20.269 --> 00:05:20.279 
172 and the other games runs like

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:23.179 
172 and the other games runs like
straight<00:05:20.520> ten<00:05:20.729> minutes<00:05:20.999> it's<00:05:21.180> a<00:05:21.830> 175<00:05:22.830> because

00:05:23.179 --> 00:05:23.189 
straight ten minutes it's a 175 because

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:24.409 
straight ten minutes it's a 175 because
it's<00:05:23.339> not<00:05:23.460> like<00:05:23.580> there's<00:05:23.729> rounds<00:05:24.150> and<00:05:24.240> you'll

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
it's not like there's rounds and you'll

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:25.760 
it's not like there's rounds and you'll
have<00:05:24.569> to<00:05:24.659> like<00:05:24.779> recap<00:05:25.199> the<00:05:25.349> flags<00:05:25.560> in<00:05:25.710> the

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
have to like recap the flags in the

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.050 
have to like recap the flags in the
together<00:05:25.949> around<00:05:26.189> 10<00:05:26.490> minutes<00:05:26.729> are<00:05:26.819> straight

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
together around 10 minutes are straight

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.279 
together around 10 minutes are straight
through<00:05:27.710> so<00:05:28.710> you<00:05:29.430> know<00:05:29.689> maybe<00:05:30.689> this<00:05:30.900> will<00:05:31.050> help

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:31.289 
through so you know maybe this will help

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:32.809 
through so you know maybe this will help
you<00:05:31.379> for<00:05:31.560> the<00:05:31.620> map<00:05:31.770> Yemen<00:05:32.129> Yemen<00:05:32.159> you<00:05:32.639> don't

00:05:32.809 --> 00:05:32.819

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:34.289 
have to play a little smart because you

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:36.469 
have to play a little smart because you
can<00:05:34.409> unbolt<00:05:34.830> all<00:05:35.490> the<00:05:35.610> flags<00:05:35.819> you<00:05:36.089> can<00:05:36.210> kind<00:05:36.419> of

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
can unbolt all the flags you can kind of

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:37.879 
can unbolt all the flags you can kind of
nade<00:05:36.719> people<00:05:36.990> off<00:05:37.080> flag<00:05:37.289> so<00:05:37.439> it's<00:05:37.560> not<00:05:37.649> like

nade people off flag so it's not like

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:39.260 
nade people off flag so it's not like
other<00:05:38.159> maps<00:05:38.430> where<00:05:38.669> you<00:05:38.699> can't<00:05:39.029> reach<00:05:39.240> the

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
other maps where you can't reach the

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.600 
other maps where you can't reach the
edge<00:05:39.539> so<00:05:39.689> you<00:05:39.779> can't<00:05:39.899> have<00:05:39.990> to<00:05:40.080> place<00:05:40.259> tomorrow

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610
