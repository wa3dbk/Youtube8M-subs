00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:10.010
 agroscience presents agro saints harvest 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.860
 greater gains the weeds here that 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.380
 strong is not taking it away but the 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.599
 groundwater level here is quite 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.029
 superficial then are weeds of 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:22.069
 deep roots and live their wide and 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.409
 they work 24 hours a day 

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:27.690
 happy as those who conditions 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:30.570
 It has the sun and humidity 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:33.270
 that you put agroscience here blacks 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:39.640
 has been handling phosphorus that is from the 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:42.910
 puig and amino acids xp amino boron 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:46.000
 calcium where you put it in the 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:49.840
 prepared from the beds and then still 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.079
 folio to folio to folio in 100 are used 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:57.339
 equipment of 3000 liters of water with 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:01:00.670
 gable and nozzles works for all 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:04.330
 the sizes of the tables that improves 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:07.180
 you saw when you used this product the 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.850
 greater assimilation of nitrogen potassium 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:14.070
 that go along with those products that 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:17.649
 I make a mixture and cultivate only 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.570
 He worked 100% and took it right away to 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:22.050
 see chat month apart and it seems very 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.789
 interesting sometimes as almost like magic 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.130
 the nutrients can be in the soil 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:30.250
 but then and the ground may be fine 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.200
 but it may be that the plant not 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.990
 want to absorb by the root system 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.960
 if you have problems in roots maybe 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.509
 Do not absorb what you have on the floor 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.210
 then the pineapple is designed to 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:46.690
 capture is a bromeliad that 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.750
 is a pipita plant that migrated from the 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.729
 trees to the ground then the system 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.890
 account to the people of the city not 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.890
 we know it's like it came from the trees 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:00.460
 of the soil of the bromeliads are 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:03.520
 plants that parasitic type that 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.780
 adapted to live from others and 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.470
 especially in the trees 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:11.230
 then the pineapple is taken out and migrated to 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.239
 soil is well adapted to soil has 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.340
 a good root structure and 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:19.360
 take advantage of soil nutrients but 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:22.330
 apart the spiracle of the whole organ 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.840
 of the plant is also made to 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.090
 capture from above water is captured 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.370
 nutrients what gives you right 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.160
 then it has two forms of recruitment 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.860
 let's say these plants 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.020
 it can be then that you have problems 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.350
 at the root and then do not catch what 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.580
 enough and the plant dies 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.100
 we were talking about conditions of 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.650
 floor long ago on ground you can 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.230
 generate problems in its structure 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.720
 root and can not take advantage of what 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.520
 there is then if you give up the 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.820
 plant assimilates it very well because it has 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:00.490
 throughout the stem has roots 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.920
 adventitious than those areas that are 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.230
 take advantage of what you give at the level 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.710
 rent from the leaf or from the same plant 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.740
 each each axilla every leaf that has a 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:14.440
 armpit that out there is soaking up and 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:17.980
 that's why you put it in that hand is 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:21.070
 a pretty practical way that is done 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.410
 and I think globally and you shall 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:26.410
 I improve with that the assimilation of 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:29.380
 nutrients that will eventually have the 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:32.350
 result in the fruit well is a way 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.850
 a little cheaper to nourish in a 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.480
 plant 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:40.120
 this more more efficient still because if 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.790
 you do not have good root structure and 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.580
 you apply there maybe you are not 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.490
 absorbing it gets it up and 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:51.430
 It works very well because I thank you very much 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:54.430
 your testimony bedi how they treated you 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.590
 ok how are these people behaving 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:01.620
 agroscience we go pretty well enough 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:05.550
 well thank you thank agro saint 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.550
 harvest greater profits 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.629
 agroscience I present
