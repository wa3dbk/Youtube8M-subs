00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 Y 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.640
 or the Swiss who sang there welcome 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.490
 to this photoshop tutorial in which 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.099
 let's see how we can create an effect 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.220
 of artificial light as if these streetlamps 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:28.480
 they were giving 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.480
 a ray of light 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:36.860
 ok let's take the polygonal loop 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.750
 of this tool here 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.030
 and we are going to mark 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.940
 where do we want to go to our ray 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.940
 because part of the light we go down to what 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.620
 and we're going to get pretty 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.620
 space 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.660
 and we mark and close 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:05.170
 so that we have our selection of what 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:07.490
 that will be the ray we give a new layer 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.970
 of adjustment curves 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:15.820
 and we will raise it a little 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.820
 to simulate the beam that we already have there 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.490
 now let's filter out blur 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.930
 Gaussian blur 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:28.520
 and let's give it a size 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:32.020
 approximately 25 or 27 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.020
 more or less there is good 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.500
 this would be the basis to do it now 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.659
 with the polygonal lasso tool 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.670
 let's do again exactly what 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.319
 same but a little smaller by 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.319
 within the radius that we had already created 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.289
 and we close our selection 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.970
 we re-create an adjustment layer of 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.970
 curves 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.380
 we are a little 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.450
 let's filter blur blur 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:12.430
 Gaussians and this time we are going to put 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:15.850
 a little bit bigger again 1 3637 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.850
 34 I'm going to give 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.180
 and we repeat a third time this time 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.460
 making it a little smaller 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:28.510
 still always above inside d 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:31.110
 which we had previously done 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.110
 we repeat 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.819
 and we have it within that focus 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.040
 and we left the same value that we had 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.260
 before 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.130
 with this we would have created our 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.970
 artificial light effect 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.920
 but there is still something we can do 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.680
 to improve a little bit that way 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.120
 pretty good just if we want 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.370
 we could change the tone a little 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.410
 to give it a yellow in this case as 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.200
 the lights of the spotlights are white I 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.239
 I leave white 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.890
 well we create a new layer and we're going to 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.890
 interpret clouds 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.860
 we do not see a filter interpret 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.770
 and clouds of difference 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:28.920
 we are not going to play with the 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.920
 let's see he went in to see how it is 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.989
 we create a layer mask and we make 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.090
 control and to invert the mask and that 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.540
 do not see anything with a brush 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.700
 round 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.700
 and a hardness of 0% 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.380
 the average size is not going to be very 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.940
 big either 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:57.910
 and the opacity more or less 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.910
 approximately 50% going to paint 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:05.770
 we have a little bit to give 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.770
 since there we see how it is appreciated 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.700
 and we would have our artificial light 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.530
 I hope you liked it 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.480

 thank you
