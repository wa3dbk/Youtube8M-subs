up<00:02:18.069> in<00:02:18.220> there<00:02:18.540> we've<00:02:19.540> got<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:20.099> what<00:02:21.099> I'm

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:21.219 
up in there we've got the what I'm

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:23.129 
up in there we've got the what I'm
thinking<00:02:21.549> is<00:02:21.639> the<00:02:21.819> coldest<00:02:22.359> shoe<00:02:22.510> adapter<00:02:22.780> now

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:23.139 
thinking is the coldest shoe adapter now

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:24.150 
thinking is the coldest shoe adapter now
this<00:02:23.319> doesn't<00:02:23.560> have

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
this doesn't have

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.070 
this doesn't have
not<00:02:24.370> threaded<00:02:24.790> so<00:02:25.420> it<00:02:25.510> doesn't<00:02:25.750> look<00:02:25.810> like<00:02:25.960> we

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
not threaded so it doesn't look like we

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.540 
not threaded so it doesn't look like we
can<00:02:26.200> screw<00:02:26.410> that<00:02:26.530> into<00:02:26.770> a<00:02:26.800> light<00:02:27.010> stand<00:02:27.220> but

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
can screw that into a light stand but

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.490 
can screw that into a light stand but
you<00:02:27.700> know<00:02:27.790> you<00:02:27.850> can't<00:02:28.090> have<00:02:28.240> everything<00:02:28.500> we've

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
got the instruction manual and we have

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.470 
got the instruction manual and we have
ourselves<00:02:32.290> a<00:02:32.890> flash<00:02:33.430> so<00:02:33.790> let's<00:02:33.970> pull<00:02:34.180> this<00:02:34.300> out

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
ourselves a flash so let's pull this out

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.020 
ourselves a flash so let's pull this out
right<00:02:34.690> here<00:02:34.930> and<00:02:35.170> you<00:02:35.370> know<00:02:36.370> just<00:02:36.400> looking<00:02:36.910> at

nikon<00:02:47.170> SB<00:02:47.940> 800<00:02:48.940> or<00:02:49.090> 900<00:02:49.270> would<00:02:49.750> have<00:02:50.340> but<00:02:51.340> you

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
nikon SB 800 or 900 would have but you

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.920 
nikon SB 800 or 900 would have but you
know<00:02:51.520> it's<00:02:51.670> very<00:02:51.790> nice<00:02:52.030> i<00:02:52.270> mean<00:02:52.420> you<00:02:52.540> can<00:02:52.690> see

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
here oh hello that was the battery door

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.100 
here oh hello that was the battery door
i'm<00:02:59.890> just<00:03:00.010> going<00:03:00.190> to<00:03:00.220> close<00:03:00.370> that<00:03:00.430> back<00:03:00.820> up

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
full 360 degree range so I'll just

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.710 
full 360 degree range so I'll just
demonstrate<00:03:10.720> that<00:03:11.230> to<00:03:11.290> you<00:03:11.500> guys<00:03:11.710> right<00:03:11.950> here

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
panel so let's put a few batteries in

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.680 
panel so let's put a few batteries in
here<00:03:32.650> just<00:03:32.680> kind<00:03:33.340> of<00:03:33.400> see<00:03:33.640> how<00:03:34.209> this<00:03:34.450> thing

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
here just kind of see how this thing

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.720 
here just kind of see how this thing
looks<00:03:34.959> when<00:03:35.530> we<00:03:35.650> fire<00:03:35.920> it<00:03:35.950> up<00:03:36.160> now<00:03:36.400> for<00:03:36.640> the

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
looks when we fire it up now for the

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.820 
looks when we fire it up now for the
time<00:03:36.940> being<00:03:37.240> i'm<00:03:37.900> just<00:03:38.110> going<00:03:38.230> to<00:03:38.260> throw<00:03:38.350> some

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
time being i'm just going to throw some

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.800 
time being i'm just going to throw some
conventional<00:03:39.430> alkaline<00:03:40.030> batteries<00:03:40.510> in<00:03:40.630> here

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
conventional alkaline batteries in here

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.960 
conventional alkaline batteries in here
but<00:03:40.959> i<00:03:40.990> don't<00:03:41.290> recommend<00:03:41.770> alkaline<00:03:42.520> batteries

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
but i don't recommend alkaline batteries

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.530 
but i don't recommend alkaline batteries
i<00:03:43.150> do<00:03:43.630> recommend<00:03:44.400> using<00:03:45.400> nicad<00:03:46.030> batteries

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
i do recommend using nicad batteries

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.740 
i do recommend using nicad batteries
because<00:03:46.900> they<00:03:47.440> tend<00:03:47.740> to<00:03:47.920> not<00:03:48.250> or<00:03:48.580> nickel<00:03:49.570> Mel

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
because they tend to not or nickel Mel

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.840 
because they tend to not or nickel Mel
hydrate<00:03:50.380> battles<00:03:50.770> because<00:03:50.950> they<00:03:51.220> tend<00:03:51.459> to<00:03:51.670> not

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
hydrate battles because they tend to not

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.810 
hydrate battles because they tend to not
overheat<00:03:52.510> and<00:03:52.980> you<00:03:53.980> don't<00:03:54.220> want<00:03:54.430> your<00:03:54.580> flash

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
overheat and you don't want your flash

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.280 
overheat and you don't want your flash
just<00:03:55.000> over<00:03:55.300> he<00:03:55.420> particularly<00:03:55.870> if<00:03:56.170> you're

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
just over he particularly if you're

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.500 
just over he particularly if you're
cycling<00:03:56.739> them<00:03:57.190> quite<00:03:57.489> a<00:03:57.520> bit<00:03:57.640> because<00:03:58.060> that<00:03:58.360> is

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
cycling them quite a bit because that is

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.990 
cycling them quite a bit because that is
that<00:03:59.170> is<00:03:59.320> not<00:03:59.530> going<00:03:59.709> to<00:03:59.770> be<00:03:59.920> good<00:04:00.040> alright<00:04:00.610> so

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
that is not going to be good alright so

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.630 
that is not going to be good alright so
let's<00:04:01.180> get<00:04:01.360> these<00:04:01.510> this<00:04:02.470> battery<00:04:02.920> situation

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
let's get these this battery situation

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.960 
let's get these this battery situation
