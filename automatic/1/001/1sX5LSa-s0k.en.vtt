 [Music] 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.260
 Hi, everyone, I'm surfing and 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.900
 salty and in this video I'm going to show you 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.510
 how arequipe pastries are made 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.980
 or dulce de leche cakes and as in 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.289
 the previous video we learned to do 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.690
 arequipe then we are ready to 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:22.060
 make these cakes the link of the 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.840
 full recipe will be available at 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.840
 end of the video 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.490
 so here we have the arequipe that 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.410
 We prepared was in the fridge for one or 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.380
 two days 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.290
 and how the arequipe tends to be exploited 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.200
 When you put it in the oven, listen 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.030
 that adding an egg yolk helps 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.220
 that the arequipe do not leave the 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.720
 that's why I added him 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.160
 this bud 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:52.160
 [Music] 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.800
 after stirring well then we go 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.809
 to work the puff pastry the 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.360
 place on a surface that is in 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.910
 Flour gives then we put a little 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.879
 more than flour above 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.650
 [Music] 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.430
 and we will also place flour 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.740
 roller 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:14.630
 [Music] 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.850
 flattens the puff pastry for 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.720
 that is about one inch of 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:23.640
 width on all four sides 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.240
 i 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.770
 [Music] 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:32.950
 and then we cut it into four squares 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.950
 [Music] 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.950
 i 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.230
 and then we're going to put more or less one 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.530
 spoonful of the arequipe in the center of 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:58.359
 each square 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:58.359
 [Music] 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.400
 and to seal the edges we're going to 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.330
 put them together with an egg wash that 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.130
 make 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.130
 stirring an egg with a spoonful 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.070
 of water this will help them to dry 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.689
 well the edges 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:17.410
 [Music] 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:19.090
 i 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.430
 [Music] 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.800
 and then we double each square by 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.530
 on top of the equipment and we seal well with 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.000
 the fingers 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.080
 Y 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.809
 ah 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.809
 [Music] 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.310
 we can also seal them well with a 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:46.730
 fork 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:49.330
 [Music] 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.330
 do not 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.600
 I have 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:00.000
 with the same egg varnish we are going to 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:08.950
 Spread the top of the cakes 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:11.170
 [Music] 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.170
 and to finish decorating the 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.260
 we put a little sugar 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.260
 to 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.849
 then we bake these cakes in a 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:29.739
 oven at 350 degrees for 20 minutes and 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:32.590
 after 20 minutes we will leave them 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:34.900
 cool in a grid and as you can see 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.180
 the yolk trick did not work 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.450
 but the taste of these cakes was 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.519
