the main advantage of the liner Matic
the<00:01:01.430> lux<00:01:01.670> is<00:01:02.149> this<00:01:02.449> on<00:01:02.960> the<00:01:03.140> automatic<00:01:03.469> this

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
the lux is this on the automatic this

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.920 
the lux is this on the automatic this
cord<00:01:04.070> would<00:01:04.250> hang<00:01:04.489> which<00:01:05.149> sits<00:01:05.449> on<00:01:05.509> the<00:01:05.660> ground

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
cord would hang which sits on the ground

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.930 
cord would hang which sits on the ground
it'd<00:01:06.560> be<00:01:06.740> ideal<00:01:06.920> it<00:01:07.340> wouldn't<00:01:07.550> be<00:01:07.610> a<00:01:07.640> problem

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
it'd be ideal it wouldn't be a problem

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.109 
it'd be ideal it wouldn't be a problem
but<00:01:08.210> this<00:01:08.600> now<00:01:08.840> retract<00:01:09.349> back<00:01:09.470> in<00:01:10.119> completed

but this now retract back in completed
nice<00:01:11.270> and<00:01:11.479> tidy<00:01:12.700> as<00:01:13.700> I<00:01:13.849> said<00:01:14.030> this<00:01:14.149> here<00:01:14.360> this

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
nice and tidy as I said this here this

nice and tidy as I said this here this
picked<00:01:14.750> it<00:01:14.840> as<00:01:14.929> a<00:01:14.959> 50<00:01:15.319> meter<00:01:15.759> rotary<00:01:16.759> and<00:01:17.030> with

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
picked it as a 50 meter rotary and with

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.139 
picked it as a 50 meter rotary and with
the<00:01:18.140> liner<00:01:18.470> Mattox<00:01:18.890> they're<00:01:19.310> 40<00:01:19.729> 50<00:01:20.000> and<00:01:20.030> 60

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:20.149 
the liner Mattox they're 40 50 and 60

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:22.330 
the liner Mattox they're 40 50 and 60
heat<00:01:20.569> they<00:01:20.869> get<00:01:21.020> as<00:01:21.170> the<00:01:21.349> lines<00:01:21.590> get<00:01:21.830> larger

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
heat they get as the lines get larger

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.370 
heat they get as the lines get larger
the<00:01:23.060> turning<00:01:23.420> server<00:01:23.599> get<00:01:23.780> larger<00:01:24.110> they<00:01:24.200> make

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
the turning server get larger they make

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.440 
the turning server get larger they make
the<00:01:24.530> arms<00:01:24.830> longer<00:01:25.099> depending<00:01:25.910> on<00:01:25.970> the<00:01:26.030> size<00:01:26.330> of

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
the arms longer depending on the size of

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.680 
the arms longer depending on the size of
the<00:01:26.569> rotary<00:01:26.929> so<00:01:27.830> this<00:01:28.250> is<00:01:28.369> a<00:01:28.399> 50<00:01:28.819> this<00:01:29.240> 50<00:01:29.539> is<00:01:29.599> a

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
the rotary so this is a 50 this 50 is a

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.219 
the rotary so this is a 50 this 50 is a
turning<00:01:30.080> circle<00:01:30.110> of<00:01:30.910> 328<00:01:31.910> centimeters<00:01:32.630> now

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
turning circle of 328 centimeters now

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.260 
turning circle of 328 centimeters now
the<00:01:33.289> 40<00:01:33.920> be<00:01:34.399> exactly<00:01:34.819> the<00:01:35.000> same

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
the 40 be exactly the same

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.839 
the 40 be exactly the same
looking<00:01:36.110> rotary<00:01:36.590> but<00:01:36.979> it<00:01:37.069> have<00:01:37.250> this<00:01:37.369> would<00:01:37.759> be

00:01:37.839 --> 00:01:37.849 
looking rotary but it have this would be

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:40.449 
looking rotary but it have this would be
lacking<00:01:38.209> this<00:01:38.479> mine<00:01:38.720> so<00:01:38.989> they<00:01:39.110> make<00:01:39.289> the<00:01:39.500> the

washing<00:01:58.429> so<00:01:59.030> as<00:01:59.179> I<00:01:59.300> say<00:01:59.420> with<00:01:59.539> a<00:01:59.569> 60<00:01:59.989> all<00:02:00.110> they

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
washing so as I say with a 60 all they

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:01.930 
washing so as I say with a 60 all they
do<00:02:00.380> they<00:02:00.500> make<00:02:00.649> that<00:02:00.679> law<00:02:01.009> arm<00:02:01.280> that<00:02:01.729> little

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
do they make that law arm that little

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.699 
do they make that law arm that little
bit<00:02:02.060> longer<00:02:02.270> out<00:02:02.810> of<00:02:02.989> somewhere<00:02:03.259> about<00:02:03.440> here

bit longer out of somewhere about here

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:06.430 
bit longer out of somewhere about here
and<00:02:03.950> there's<00:02:04.910> an<00:02:05.000> extra<00:02:05.209> line<00:02:05.450> on<00:02:05.690> it<00:02:05.840> over<00:02:06.289> top

that Leifheit supply with the rotary is
the<00:03:06.799> ground<00:03:07.010> tube<00:03:07.219> but<00:03:07.639> my<00:03:07.730> fight<00:03:07.939> believe

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
the ground tube but my fight believe

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.750 
the ground tube but my fight believe
that<00:03:08.510> concrete<00:03:09.260> in<00:03:09.379> any<00:03:09.680> is<00:03:09.859> better<00:03:10.400> for<00:03:10.669> the

that concrete in any is better for the

that concrete in any is better for the

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
rotary for the longevity of the rotary

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.589 
rotary for the longevity of the rotary
than<00:03:12.919> it<00:03:13.010> is<00:03:13.099> put<00:03:13.280> it<00:03:13.370> in<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:13.489> soil<00:03:13.790> you<00:03:14.030> can

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
than it is put it in the soil you can

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.800 
than it is put it in the soil you can
get<00:03:14.989> a<00:03:15.230> soil<00:03:15.500> sphere<00:03:16.209> it<00:03:17.209> actually<00:03:17.510> screws

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
get a soil sphere it actually screws

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.240 
get a soil sphere it actually screws
into<00:03:18.019> the<00:03:18.109> ground<00:03:18.379> with<00:03:18.560> a<00:03:18.620> LifeFlight<00:03:18.980> but

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
into the ground with a LifeFlight but

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.830 
into the ground with a LifeFlight but
they<00:03:19.730> believe<00:03:20.000> that<00:03:20.030> concrete<00:03:20.450> and<00:03:20.540> in<00:03:20.719> I

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
they believe that concrete and in I

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.839 
they believe that concrete and in I
believe<00:03:21.079> also<00:03:21.709> it<00:03:21.829> is<00:03:21.919> actually<00:03:22.220> a<00:03:22.250> more

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849 
believe also it is actually a more

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:24.789 
believe also it is actually a more
permanent<00:03:23.150> fitting<00:03:23.750> and<00:03:23.959> it's<00:03:24.470> not<00:03:24.590> going<00:03:24.739> to

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
permanent fitting and it's not going to

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.409 
permanent fitting and it's not going to
rip<00:03:24.919> out<00:03:25.069> the<00:03:25.250> ground<00:03:25.549> and<00:03:25.819> it's<00:03:25.909> it's<00:03:26.269> gonna

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:26.419 
rip out the ground and it's it's gonna

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:28.750 
rip out the ground and it's it's gonna
inevitably<00:03:27.229> make<00:03:27.979> your<00:03:28.129> rotary<00:03:28.459> last<00:03:28.639> a

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
inevitably make your rotary last a

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.879 
inevitably make your rotary last a
little<00:03:28.909> bit<00:03:29.030> longer<00:03:29.120> so<00:03:30.019> what<00:03:30.470> it<00:03:30.590> comes<00:03:30.739> with

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:30.889 
little bit longer so what it comes with
