there's<00:00:30.739> plenty<00:00:31.189> of<00:00:31.310> games<00:00:31.550> I<00:00:31.789> have<00:00:31.819> here<00:00:32.390> that

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
there's plenty of games I have here that

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.820 
there's plenty of games I have here that
are<00:00:33.110> full<00:00:33.530> of<00:00:33.890> area<00:00:34.850> control<00:00:35.390> so<00:00:35.720> is<00:00:35.930> one<00:00:36.530> more

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:36.830 
are full of area control so is one more

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.860 
are full of area control so is one more
going<00:00:37.100> to<00:00:37.190> matter<00:00:37.460> well<00:00:37.910> this<00:00:38.120> one<00:00:38.300> here<00:00:38.750> is

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
going to matter well this one here is

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.220 
going to matter well this one here is
area<00:00:39.860> control<00:00:40.310> mixed<00:00:40.700> with<00:00:41.030> die<00:00:41.510> rolling<00:00:42.050> and

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
area control mixed with die rolling and

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.290 
area control mixed with die rolling and
certainly<00:00:42.680> has<00:00:42.890> a<00:00:42.920> bit<00:00:43.160> of<00:00:43.280> in-your-face<00:00:43.550> feel

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
certainly has a bit of in-your-face feel

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.590 
certainly has a bit of in-your-face feel
to<00:00:44.510> it<00:00:44.570> it's<00:00:45.560> very<00:00:45.920> short<00:00:46.340> it's<00:00:46.670> those<00:00:47.390> of<00:00:47.510> the

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
to it it's very short it's those of the

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.510 
to it it's very short it's those of the
five<00:00:47.750> players<00:00:48.050> and<00:00:48.320> takes<00:00:48.530> about<00:00:48.710> 15<00:00:49.160> to<00:00:49.280> 30

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
five players and takes about 15 to 30

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.130 
five players and takes about 15 to 30
minutes<00:00:49.760> although<00:00:50.150> I<00:00:50.300> would<00:00:50.630> say<00:00:50.810> if<00:00:50.870> you<00:00:50.960> play

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
minutes although I would say if you play

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.140 
minutes although I would say if you play
in<00:00:51.200> 30<00:00:51.500> minutes<00:00:51.740> you're<00:00:52.430> playing<00:00:52.610> with<00:00:52.790> people

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.150 
in 30 minutes you're playing with people

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.140 
in 30 minutes you're playing with people
who<00:00:53.330> are<00:00:53.510> very<00:00:53.800> analytical<00:00:54.800> and<00:00:55.280> there's<00:00:55.970> an

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
who are very analytical and there's an

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.970 
who are very analytical and there's an
slow<00:00:56.510> and<00:00:56.720> they're<00:00:56.870> thinking<00:00:57.290> it's<00:00:57.860> probably

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
slow and they're thinking it's probably

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.460 
slow and they're thinking it's probably
leans<00:00:58.340> more<00:00:58.550> towards<00:00:58.820> 15<00:00:59.240> minutes<00:00:59.570> that

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.470 
leans more towards 15 minutes that

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.950 
leans more towards 15 minutes that
sounds<00:01:00.770> interesting<00:01:01.220> let's<00:01:01.700> check<00:01:01.940> it<00:01:02.090> out<00:01:02.210> so

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
sounds interesting let's check it out so

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.630 
sounds interesting let's check it out so
here's<00:01:03.170> the<00:01:03.350> board<00:01:03.560> for<00:01:03.740> Cambria<00:01:04.220> which

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
here's the board for Cambria which

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.580 
here's the board for Cambria which
actually<00:01:04.879> has<00:01:05.600> another<00:01:05.990> board<00:01:06.290> on<00:01:06.380> the<00:01:06.440> other

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
actually has another board on the other

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.550 
actually has another board on the other
side<00:01:06.890> for<00:01:07.490> Cumbria<00:01:08.270> it's<00:01:08.630> actually<00:01:09.200> just

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
side for Cumbria it's actually just

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.250 
side for Cumbria it's actually just
another<00:01:09.860> layout<00:01:10.159> you<00:01:10.610> know<00:01:10.700> so<00:01:10.909> you<00:01:10.940> have

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
another layout you know so you have

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
another layout you know so you have
alternate<00:01:12.260> ways<00:01:12.440> to<00:01:12.650> play<00:01:12.830> and<00:01:12.980> you<00:01:13.040> don't<00:01:13.190> get

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
alternate ways to play and you don't get

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.649 
alternate ways to play and you don't get
bored<00:01:13.490> with<00:01:13.670> playing<00:01:13.790> the<00:01:13.940> same<00:01:14.180> bored<00:01:14.510> all

and so the second-place player will get

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.130 
and so the second-place player will get
the<00:02:03.650> second<00:02:04.100> token<00:02:04.549> if<00:02:04.939> there<00:02:05.750> is<00:02:05.869> such<00:02:06.110> a

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
the second token if there is such a

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.520 
the second token if there is such a
thing<00:02:06.939> so<00:02:07.939> this<00:02:08.660> is<00:02:08.810> the<00:02:08.929> way<00:02:09.050> that<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.319> game

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
thing so this is the way that the game

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.990 
thing so this is the way that the game
is<00:02:09.679> initially<00:02:10.160> set<00:02:10.399> up<00:02:10.550> and<00:02:10.900> let

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
is initially set up and let

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.080 
is initially set up and let
quickly<00:02:12.870> finish<00:02:13.260> this<00:02:13.440> for<00:02:14.190> you<00:02:14.400> here<00:02:15.290> and

roll two dice you're going to look at

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.650 
roll two dice you're going to look at
the<00:02:32.010> two<00:02:32.190> numbers<00:02:32.580> that<00:02:32.610> you've<00:02:32.940> rolled<00:02:33.270> let's

will be doing for most of the turns if
they<00:02:52.230> roll<00:02:52.970> doubles<00:02:54.230> let's<00:02:55.230> say<00:02:55.380> roll<00:02:55.560> double

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
a cube here I can kick the cube out and

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.690 
a cube here I can kick the cube out and
the<00:03:24.480> Tribune<00:03:24.810> takes<00:03:24.989> a<00:03:25.110> spot<00:03:25.350> and<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:26.400> Tribune

the Tribune takes a spot and the Tribune

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.009 
the Tribune takes a spot and the Tribune
just<00:03:26.880> basically<00:03:27.150> gets<00:03:27.390> in<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.540> way<00:03:27.690> and<00:03:27.720> is

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
just basically gets in the way and is

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.660 
just basically gets in the way and is
basically<00:03:28.560> an<00:03:28.650> annoyance<00:03:29.040> although<00:03:29.310> I<00:03:29.340> can

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
basically an annoyance although I can

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.340 
basically an annoyance although I can
displace<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.450> Tribune<00:03:30.750> and<00:03:30.840> send<00:03:31.080> them<00:03:31.140> back

fortunately I have a guy on three I can
use<00:03:45.480> him<00:03:45.750> instead<00:03:46.110> and<00:03:46.320> put<00:03:46.470> him<00:03:46.590> next<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:46.860> a

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
use him instead and put him next to a

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.229 
use him instead and put him next to a
city<00:03:47.190> that's<00:03:47.370> three<00:03:47.989> now<00:03:48.989> when<00:03:49.680> you<00:03:49.709> are<00:03:50.239> done

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
city that's three now when you are done

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.270 
city that's three now when you are done
completely<00:03:51.690> surrounding<00:03:52.290> a<00:03:52.380> city<00:03:52.620> so<00:03:53.130> let's

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
completely surrounding a city so let's

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.120 
completely surrounding a city so let's
say<00:03:53.400> have<00:03:53.579> a<00:03:53.610> three-city<00:03:54.150> here<00:03:54.540> and<00:03:54.720> on<00:03:55.650> two<00:03:56.100> of

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
say have a three-city here and on two of

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.680 
say have a three-city here and on two of
the<00:03:56.220> lines<00:03:56.430> there's<00:03:56.730> a<00:03:56.790> blue<00:03:57.000> and<00:03:57.030> on<00:03:57.390> one<00:03:57.570> line

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
the lines there's a blue and on one line

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.690 
the lines there's a blue and on one line
is<00:03:57.870> agreements<00:03:58.290> completely<00:03:58.709> surrounded<00:03:59.130> Blue

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
is agreements completely surrounded Blue

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.610 
is agreements completely surrounded Blue
has<00:03:59.730> a<00:03:59.940> majority<00:04:00.450> so<00:04:00.810> blue<00:04:00.989> takes<00:04:01.260> this<00:04:01.470> as

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
has a majority so blue takes this as

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.800 
has a majority so blue takes this as
victory<00:04:02.220> points<00:04:02.579> up<00:04:03.090> here<00:04:03.450> this<00:04:03.600> one's

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
victory points up here this one's

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.449 
victory points up here this one's
finished<00:04:04.019> yellow<00:04:04.530> and<00:04:04.739> blue<00:04:04.860> but<00:04:05.070> is<00:04:05.160> its<00:04:05.310> high

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
finished yellow and blue but is its high

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.180 
finished yellow and blue but is its high
so<00:04:05.760> nobody<00:04:06.120> gets<00:04:06.299> it<00:04:06.540> if<00:04:06.690> that's<00:04:07.380> changed<00:04:07.799> for

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
so nobody gets it if that's changed for

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.039 
so nobody gets it if that's changed for
any<00:04:08.370> instance<00:04:09.030> let's<00:04:09.269> say<00:04:09.329> blue<00:04:09.630> gets<00:04:09.840> another

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
any instance let's say blue gets another

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.830 
any instance let's say blue gets another
cube<00:04:10.410> in<00:04:10.500> there<00:04:10.680> then<00:04:11.370> blue<00:04:11.700> will<00:04:11.910> get<00:04:12.060> it<00:04:12.209> the

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
cube in there then blue will get it the

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.500 
cube in there then blue will get it the
bigger<00:04:13.049> cities<00:04:13.260> as<00:04:13.530> i<00:04:13.650> already<00:04:13.769> said<00:04:14.130> are<00:04:14.549> set

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
bigger cities as i already said are set

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.330 
bigger cities as i already said are set
up<00:04:15.630> so<00:04:15.660> that<00:04:15.810> if<00:04:16.049> someone<00:04:16.229> wins<00:04:16.440> then<00:04:16.680> they<00:04:17.190> get

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
up so that if someone wins then they get

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.860 
up so that if someone wins then they get
first<00:04:17.609> place<00:04:17.850> and<00:04:18.090> if<00:04:18.150> there<00:04:18.299> is<00:04:18.329> a<00:04:18.419> second

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
first place and if there is a second

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.199 
first place and if there is a second
place<00:04:19.049> which<00:04:19.470> usually<00:04:19.890> doesn't<00:04:20.430> happen<00:04:20.459> then

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
place which usually doesn't happen then

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.300 
place which usually doesn't happen then
they<00:04:21.390> get<00:04:21.539> the<00:04:21.690> extra<00:04:22.109> points<00:04:22.470> and<00:04:22.650> you<00:04:23.130> keep

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
they get the extra points and you keep

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.910 
they get the extra points and you keep
going<00:04:23.640> until<00:04:23.820> there's<00:04:24.180> six<00:04:24.720> or<00:04:24.960> less<00:04:25.200> of<00:04:25.530> these

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
going until there's six or less of these

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.760 
going until there's six or less of these
less<00:04:26.070> than<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.370> border<00:04:27.410> one<00:04:28.410> two<00:04:28.530> three<00:04:28.560> four

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
less than the border one two three four

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.680 
less than the border one two three four
five<00:04:28.920> six<00:04:29.220> that's<00:04:29.700> it<00:04:29.880> the<00:04:30.060> game's<00:04:30.270> over<00:04:30.480> at

anything<00:05:17.880> that's<00:05:18.060> exactly<00:05:18.660> like<00:05:18.900> it<00:05:19.140> yeah<00:05:19.620> I

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
anything that's exactly like it yeah I

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.380 
anything that's exactly like it yeah I
can<00:05:19.860> think<00:05:19.980> of<00:05:20.040> lots<00:05:20.160> of<00:05:20.370> area<00:05:20.790> control<00:05:21.150> games

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:21.390 
can think of lots of area control games

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:22.790 
can think of lots of area control games
and<00:05:21.660> trying<00:05:21.840> to<00:05:21.900> control<00:05:22.200> different<00:05:22.440> routes

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
and trying to control different routes

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.710 
and trying to control different routes
in<00:05:22.980> the<00:05:23.100> cities<00:05:23.400> but<00:05:24.030> I<00:05:24.090> don't<00:05:24.270> know<00:05:24.390> one<00:05:24.600> that

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
in the cities but I don't know one that

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.020 
in the cities but I don't know one that
uses<00:05:24.990> dice<00:05:25.560> to<00:05:25.830> let<00:05:26.010> you<00:05:26.100> place<00:05:26.400> those<00:05:26.610> figures

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
uses dice to let you place those figures

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.670 
uses dice to let you place those figures
I<00:05:27.240> think<00:05:27.960> it<00:05:28.020> could<00:05:28.110> have<00:05:28.230> used<00:05:28.350> a<00:05:28.440> little<00:05:28.470> bit

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
I think it could have used a little bit

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.950 
I think it could have used a little bit
of<00:05:28.800> maybe<00:05:29.520> small<00:05:29.910> soldiers<00:05:30.270> instead<00:05:30.660> of<00:05:30.840> the

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
of maybe small soldiers instead of the

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.250 
of maybe small soldiers instead of the
cubes<00:05:31.280> but<00:05:32.280> other<00:05:32.970> than<00:05:33.270> that<00:05:33.330> and<00:05:33.930> the<00:05:34.110> fact

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
cubes but other than that and the fact

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.070 
cubes but other than that and the fact
that<00:05:34.440> it's<00:05:34.620> really<00:05:34.800> not<00:05:35.120> terribly<00:05:36.120> deep<00:05:36.450> it<00:05:36.720> is

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
that it's really not terribly deep it is

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.460 
that it's really not terribly deep it is
an<00:05:37.410> interesting<00:05:38.040> light<00:05:38.550> filler<00:05:38.940> that<00:05:39.470> several

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
an interesting light filler that several

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.530 
an interesting light filler that several
those<00:05:40.620> I<00:05:40.740> played<00:05:40.950> it<00:05:41.070> with<00:05:41.160> we're<00:05:41.400> like<00:05:41.550> okay

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:42.540 
those I played it with we're like okay

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:43.610 
those I played it with we're like okay
that<00:05:42.720> seemed<00:05:42.900> to<00:05:42.930> be<00:05:43.080> the<00:05:43.110> general<00:05:43.470> reaction

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
that seemed to be the general reaction

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.710 
that seemed to be the general reaction
but<00:05:44.430> I<00:05:44.460> wonder<00:05:44.730> if<00:05:44.880> it<00:05:44.970> might<00:05:45.000> have<00:05:45.270> more<00:05:45.450> legs

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 
but I wonder if it might have more legs

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.400 
but I wonder if it might have more legs
