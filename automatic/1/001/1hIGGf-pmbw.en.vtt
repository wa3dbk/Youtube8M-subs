00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
left and then we can see all my custom

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.240 
left and then we can see all my custom
ones<00:01:36.900> I've<00:01:37.049> got<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.320> there<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.619> can<00:01:37.770> add<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:37.979> new

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
ones I've got in there you can add a new

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.370 
ones I've got in there you can add a new
one<00:01:38.430> which<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.850> based<00:01:39.090> always<00:01:39.720> on<00:01:39.990> one<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.200> the

one which is based always on one of the
standard<00:01:41.009> ones<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:41.430> for<00:01:41.579> example<00:01:41.970> this<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.119> a

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
standard ones so for example this is a

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.420 
standard ones so for example this is a
mixer<00:01:42.689> one<00:01:42.840> which<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.649> all<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.860> bells<00:01:44.280> and

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
mixer one which is the all the bells and

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.370 
mixer one which is the all the bells and
whistles<00:01:44.820> on<00:01:44.970> there<00:01:45.210> all<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.930> governs<00:01:46.290> that

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
whistles on there all the governs that

whistles on there all the governs that
you<00:01:46.500> could<00:01:46.619> possibly<00:01:46.950> want<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.340> can<00:01:47.520> rename

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
you could possibly want you can rename

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.819 
you could possibly want you can rename

down I'm going to move that one to the
top<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:55.020> my<00:01:55.170> list<00:01:55.909> now<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:57.149> far<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:57.600> simple<00:01:58.020> but

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
top of my list now so far so simple but

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.569 
top of my list now so far so simple but
you<00:01:58.259> need<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.680> bear<00:01:58.829> in<00:01:58.860> mind<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.250> not<00:01:59.399> every

single thing that you change in these

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.149 
single thing that you change in these
preferences<00:02:02.430> will<00:02:03.119> go<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:04.200> will<00:02:04.259> be<00:02:04.590> different

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
preferences will go it will be different

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.469 
preferences will go it will be different
for<00:02:05.369> each<00:02:05.430> layout<00:02:05.729> they<00:02:05.969> have<00:02:06.210> for<00:02:06.420> example

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
for each layout they have for example

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.570 
for each layout they have for example
the<00:02:06.930> deck<00:02:07.140> flavor<00:02:07.530> we're<00:02:08.129> going<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.399> deck

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
the deck flavor we're going to deck

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.040 
the deck flavor we're going to deck
layout<00:02:08.970> on<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.149> left<00:02:09.300> hand<00:02:09.420> side<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.810> we<00:02:09.869> look

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
layout on the left hand side and we look

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.020 
layout on the left hand side and we look
at<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.319> let's<00:02:10.770> change<00:02:11.039> deck<00:02:11.310> seat<00:02:11.520> or<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:11.670> remix

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
at the let's change deck seat or a remix

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.880 
at the let's change deck seat or a remix
deck<00:02:12.209> now<00:02:12.330> I've<00:02:12.420> changed<00:02:12.599> it<00:02:12.840> for<00:02:13.020> this<00:02:13.230> layout

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
deck now I've changed it for this layout

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.680 
deck now I've changed it for this layout
but<00:02:14.100> if<00:02:14.190> I<00:02:14.310> then<00:02:14.610> go<00:02:14.670> through<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.270> my<00:02:15.420> other

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
but if I then go through to my other

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.900 
but if I then go through to my other
four<00:02:16.410> deck<00:02:16.620> layouts<00:02:16.980> you'll<00:02:17.160> see<00:02:17.370> that<00:02:17.490> Dexy

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
four deck layouts you'll see that Dexy

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.540 
four deck layouts you'll see that Dexy
is<00:02:18.150> still<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.510> remix<00:02:18.900> deck<00:02:19.110> so<00:02:19.350> that<00:02:19.590> persists

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
is still a remix deck so that persists

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.450 
is still a remix deck so that persists
across<00:02:20.730> all<00:02:21.240> your<00:02:21.360> different<00:02:21.480> layouts<00:02:22.070> one<00:02:23.070> so

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
across all your different layouts one so

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.800 
across all your different layouts one so
you<00:02:23.520> need<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.880> bear<00:02:24.060> thy<00:02:24.210> mind<00:02:24.420> one<00:02:24.600> thing

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
you need to bear thy mind one thing

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.360 
you need to bear thy mind one thing
which<00:02:24.960> does<00:02:25.200> change<00:02:25.500> is<00:02:25.740> obviously<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.160> deck

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
which does change is obviously the deck

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.190 
which does change is obviously the deck
size<00:02:26.670> themselves<00:02:27.300> so<00:02:27.420> deck<00:02:27.600> layout<00:02:27.930> we<00:02:28.050> can

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
size themselves so deck layout we can

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.750 
size themselves so deck layout we can
choose<00:02:28.410> between<00:02:28.560> advanced<00:02:29.100> right<00:02:29.430> down<00:02:29.610> to

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
choose between advanced right down to

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.080 
choose between advanced right down to
micro<00:02:30.210> and<00:02:30.530> you<00:02:31.530> can<00:02:31.740> show<00:02:32.010> C<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.430> D<00:02:32.610> as<00:02:32.820> well

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
micro and you can show C and D as well

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.910 
micro and you can show C and D as well
they're<00:02:33.360> on<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:33.990> right<00:02:34.140> hand<00:02:34.350> so<00:02:34.500> I<00:02:34.530> just<00:02:34.740> turn

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
they're on the right hand so I just turn

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.680 
they're on the right hand so I just turn
those<00:02:35.100> on<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.340> off<00:02:35.580> now<00:02:35.820> one<00:02:36.360> thing<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.570> keep

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
those on and off now one thing to keep

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.050 
those on and off now one thing to keep
in<00:02:37.020> mind<00:02:37.290> with<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.860> actual<00:02:38.160> deck<00:02:38.340> sizing<00:02:38.880> is

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
in mind with the actual deck sizing is

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.690 
in mind with the actual deck sizing is
that<00:02:39.300> for<00:02:39.930> example<00:02:39.959> I've<00:02:40.410> got<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.590> 1280<00:02:41.130> by<00:02:41.459> 800

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
that for example I've got a 1280 by 800

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.820 
that for example I've got a 1280 by 800
screen<00:02:42.420> resolution<00:02:43.110> screen<00:02:43.410> here<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:43.709> one

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
screen resolution screen here and one

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.740 
screen resolution screen here and one
method<00:02:43.950> pro<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:44.970> means<00:02:45.180> I<00:02:45.300> haven't<00:02:45.480> got<00:02:45.660> the

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
method pro that means I haven't got the

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.090 
method pro that means I haven't got the
highest<00:02:45.990> resolution<00:02:46.140> out<00:02:46.590> there<00:02:46.800> if<00:02:46.950> you've

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
highest resolution out there if you've

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.740 
highest resolution out there if you've

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
the highest settings then you can fit

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.800

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
large the C and D as well as the a and B

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.070 
large the C and D as well as the a and B
then<00:03:02.520> I'm<00:03:02.670> actually<00:03:02.850> going<00:03:03.000> to<00:03:03.180> have<00:03:03.390> a<00:03:03.570> not

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
then I'm actually going to have a not

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.710 
then I'm actually going to have a not
only<00:03:04.350> much<00:03:04.560> in<00:03:04.830> terms<00:03:05.040> of<00:03:05.310> track<00:03:06.300> browsing

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
only much in terms of track browsing

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.810 
only much in terms of track browsing
ability<00:03:07.080> but<00:03:07.200> also<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.560> global<00:03:07.830> bar<00:03:08.280> here<00:03:08.700> at

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
ability but also the global bar here at

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.460 
ability but also the global bar here at
the<00:03:08.910> top<00:03:09.120> with<00:03:09.270> the<00:03:09.300> effect<00:03:09.660> settings<00:03:10.110> in<00:03:10.320> the

the top with the effect settings in the
master<00:03:11.100> clock<00:03:11.489> and<00:03:11.670> so<00:03:11.790> on<00:03:11.850> will<00:03:12.330> just

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
master clock and so on will just

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.780 
master clock and so on will just
disappear<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:13.140> tractor<00:03:13.620> will<00:03:13.830> prioritize

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
disappear the tractor will prioritize

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.840 
disappear the tractor will prioritize
the<00:03:15.390> decks<00:03:15.690> on<00:03:15.989> your<00:03:16.560> layout<00:03:16.800> so<00:03:17.310> you<00:03:17.370> just

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
the decks on your layout so you just

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.850 
the decks on your layout so you just
something<00:03:18.390> to<00:03:18.480> bear<00:03:18.630> in<00:03:18.690> mind<00:03:19.019> as<00:03:19.290> you're<00:03:19.590> you

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
something to bear in mind as you're you

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.140 
something to bear in mind as you're you
know<00:03:19.950> making<00:03:20.430> up<00:03:20.489> these<00:03:20.640> layouts<00:03:21.030> for

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
know making up these layouts for

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.120 
know making up these layouts for
different<00:03:21.209> situations<00:03:21.930> remember<00:03:22.830> what

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
different situations remember what

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.680 
different situations remember what
you're<00:03:23.310> going<00:03:23.459> to<00:03:23.519> have<00:03:23.640> in<00:03:23.820> your<00:03:23.850> individual

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
you're going to have in your individual

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.220 
you're going to have in your individual
outs<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.380> platter<00:03:25.890> scope<00:03:26.640> displays<00:03:27.060> do<00:03:27.330> come

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
outs the platter scope displays do come

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.140 
outs the platter scope displays do come
and<00:03:28.380> go<00:03:28.440> with<00:03:28.890> each<00:03:29.160> layout<00:03:29.549> so<00:03:29.760> you<00:03:29.850> can<00:03:30.000> have

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
and go with each layout so you can have

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.490 
and go with each layout so you can have
them<00:03:30.330> in<00:03:30.450> one<00:03:30.630> and<00:03:30.810> not<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:30.989> other<00:03:31.019> that's<00:03:31.350> why

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
them in one and not the other that's why

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.470 
them in one and not the other that's why
I've<00:03:31.560> got<00:03:31.620> them<00:03:31.799> in<00:03:31.860> my<00:03:31.920> DVS<00:03:32.430> one<00:03:32.640> and<00:03:32.910> all<00:03:33.450> the

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
I've got them in my DVS one and all the

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.710 
I've got them in my DVS one and all the
other<00:03:33.690> ones<00:03:33.870> your<00:03:34.860> grid<00:03:35.250> stuff<00:03:35.730> will<00:03:36.090> assist

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
other ones your grid stuff will assist

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.870 
other ones your grid stuff will assist
across<00:03:37.170> all<00:03:37.410> your<00:03:37.560> different<00:03:37.650> layouts<00:03:38.130> so<00:03:38.400> you

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
across all your different layouts so you

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.190 
across all your different layouts so you
set<00:03:39.090> that<00:03:39.180> once<00:03:39.420> and<00:03:39.690> then<00:03:39.840> forget<00:03:40.170> it

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
set that once and then forget it

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.020 
set that once and then forget it
whatever<00:03:40.530> layout<00:03:41.100> you<00:03:41.280> using<00:03:41.640> that<00:03:41.760> will<00:03:41.880> stay

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
whatever layout you using that will stay

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.970 
whatever layout you using that will stay
the<00:03:42.180> same<00:03:42.209> but<00:03:42.930> what<00:03:43.110> does<00:03:43.260> change<00:03:43.290> is<00:03:43.680> cover

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
the same but what does change is cover

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.190 
the same but what does change is cover
art<00:03:44.250> so<00:03:44.459> cover<00:03:44.730> art<00:03:44.940> you<00:03:45.060> can<00:03:45.209> show<00:03:45.450> it<00:03:45.630> in<00:03:45.900> one

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
art so cover art you can show it in one

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.160 
art so cover art you can show it in one
layout<00:03:46.560> and<00:03:46.820> you<00:03:47.820> can<00:03:48.000> hide<00:03:48.239> it<00:03:48.450> in<00:03:48.720> another

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
layout and you can hide it in another

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.370 
layout and you can hide it in another
one<00:03:49.380> quite<00:03:49.709> simply<00:03:50.420> so<00:03:51.420> for<00:03:51.570> example<00:03:52.019> I've<00:03:52.200> got

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
one quite simply so for example I've got

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.470 
one quite simply so for example I've got
it<00:03:52.470> shown<00:03:52.680> in<00:03:52.709> my<00:03:52.920> DJ<00:03:53.220> TT<00:03:53.640> layout<00:03:53.970> but<00:03:54.209> it's<00:03:54.330> not

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
it shown in my DJ TT layout but it's not

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.259 
it shown in my DJ TT layout but it's not
there<00:03:54.690> in<00:03:54.840> my<00:03:54.959> other<00:03:55.140> ones<00:03:55.459> same<00:03:56.459> goes<00:03:56.700> for<00:03:56.730> the

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
there in my other ones same goes for the

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.020 
there in my other ones same goes for the
phase<00:03:57.630> meter<00:03:57.900> as<00:03:58.290> well<00:03:58.530> that<00:03:59.040> one<00:03:59.280> will<00:04:00.000> change

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
phase meter as well that one will change

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.670 
phase meter as well that one will change
according<00:04:00.750> to<00:04:00.780> each<00:04:00.989> lap<00:04:01.170> so<00:04:01.290> you<00:04:01.350> can<00:04:01.500> have<00:04:01.650> it

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
according to each lap so you can have it

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.979 
according to each lap so you can have it
in<00:04:01.830> one<00:04:01.980> layout<00:04:02.190> and<00:04:02.489> not<00:04:02.700> the<00:04:02.820> other<00:04:02.970> so<00:04:03.630> it's

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
in one layout and not the other so it's

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.350 
in one layout and not the other so it's
gone<00:04:04.140> there<00:04:04.410> in<00:04:04.530> that<00:04:04.620> one<00:04:04.739> and<00:04:05.010> it's<00:04:05.790> back

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
gone there in that one and it's back

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.509 
gone there in that one and it's back
normal<00:04:07.049> moves<00:04:07.230> to<00:04:07.380> my<00:04:07.560> pre-existing<00:04:08.489> ones

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
normal moves to my pre-existing ones

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.449 
normal moves to my pre-existing ones
that<00:04:08.790> I've<00:04:08.910> built<00:04:09.120> before<00:04:09.650> so<00:04:10.650> there's<00:04:11.130> lots

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
that I've built before so there's lots

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:12.800 
that I've built before so there's lots
of<00:04:11.579> different<00:04:11.640> options<00:04:12.180> that<00:04:12.269> you<00:04:12.360> can<00:04:12.450> tweak

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
of different options that you can tweak

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.449 
of different options that you can tweak
around<00:04:12.989> with<00:04:13.380> all<00:04:13.769> these<00:04:14.010> stuff<00:04:14.190> like<00:04:14.340> your

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
around with all these stuff like your

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.219 
around with all these stuff like your
deck<00:04:14.610> header<00:04:14.850> information<00:04:15.120> that<00:04:15.630> will<00:04:15.900> assist

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
deck header information that will assist

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.020 
deck header information that will assist
across<00:04:16.799> different<00:04:17.100> layouts<00:04:17.370> as<00:04:17.549> well<00:04:17.579> there's

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
across different layouts as well there's

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.610 
across different layouts as well there's
no<00:04:18.239> changing<00:04:18.930> of<00:04:18.989> that<00:04:19.169> as<00:04:19.350> you<00:04:19.470> go<00:04:19.590> through

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
no changing of that as you go through

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.560 
no changing of that as you go through
obviously<00:04:20.190> different<00:04:20.669> exercises<00:04:21.030> do<00:04:21.329> show

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
obviously different exercises do show

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.630 
obviously different exercises do show
different<00:04:21.930> amounts<00:04:22.200> of<00:04:22.289> stuff<00:04:22.530> and<00:04:22.830> there's

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
different amounts of stuff and there's

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.000 
different amounts of stuff and there's
also<00:04:23.789> the<00:04:24.090> mixer<00:04:24.510> parameters<00:04:25.169> and

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
also the mixer parameters and

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.470 
also the mixer parameters and
the<00:04:26.220> actual<00:04:26.580> layout<00:04:26.730> of<00:04:26.820> the<00:04:26.910> mixer<00:04:27.270> will

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
the actual layout of the mixer will

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.540 
the actual layout of the mixer will
change<00:04:27.930> according<00:04:28.410> to<00:04:28.440> your<00:04:28.530> preset<00:04:29.220> layout

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
change according to your preset layout

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.460 
change according to your preset layout
so<00:04:29.880> for<00:04:30.180> example<00:04:30.630> we've<00:04:30.750> got<00:04:30.780> on<00:04:31.050> display<00:04:31.350> on

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
so for example we've got on display on

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.590 
so for example we've got on display on
this<00:04:31.590> one<00:04:31.800> we've<00:04:31.920> got<00:04:31.950> the<00:04:32.220> EQs<00:04:33.180> we've<00:04:33.390> got<00:04:33.510> the

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
this one we've got the EQs we've got the

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.360 
this one we've got the EQs we've got the
crossfader<00:04:34.080> we've<00:04:34.440> got<00:04:34.560> the<00:04:34.650> up<00:04:34.770> faders<00:04:35.190> it's

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
don't really need to see that stuff you

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.140 
don't really need to see that stuff you
might<00:04:52.950> do<00:04:53.130> this<00:04:53.250> up<00:04:53.430> to<00:04:53.550> you<00:04:53.700> and<00:04:53.850> that<00:04:53.910> gives

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
might do this up to you and that gives

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.460 
might do this up to you and that gives
you<00:04:54.210> a<00:04:54.240> bit<00:04:54.360> more<00:04:54.390> space<00:04:54.540> for<00:04:54.780> the<00:04:54.990> waveforms

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
you a bit more space for the waveforms

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.770 
you a bit more space for the waveforms
there<00:04:55.710> as<00:04:55.980> well<00:04:56.250> I<00:04:56.490> do<00:04:56.790> like<00:04:57.060> to<00:04:57.210> have<00:04:57.360> this<00:04:57.570> one

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
there as well I do like to have this one

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.900 
there as well I do like to have this one
the<00:04:57.990> filter<00:04:58.470> key<00:04:58.680> game<00:04:59.010> cute<00:04:59.400> and<00:04:59.580> balanced

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
the filter key game cute and balanced

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.330 
the filter key game cute and balanced
all<00:05:00.570> there<00:05:00.930> and<00:05:01.290> so<00:05:01.560> just<00:05:01.740> so<00:05:01.860> I<00:05:01.890> can<00:05:02.040> have<00:05:02.160> the

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
all there and so just so I can have the

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.000 
all there and so just so I can have the
auto<00:05:02.580> gain<00:05:03.000> and<00:05:03.300> tweak<00:05:04.080> those<00:05:04.320> gains<00:05:04.620> that

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
auto gain and tweak those gains that

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.860 
auto gain and tweak those gains that
it's<00:05:05.190> preset<00:05:05.670> if<00:05:05.790> I<00:05:05.940> feel<00:05:06.180> the<00:05:06.300> need<00:05:06.330> to<00:05:06.510> I<00:05:06.690> do

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
it's preset if I feel the need to I do

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.330 
it's preset if I feel the need to I do
use<00:05:07.110> auto<00:05:07.290> going<00:05:07.620> on<00:05:07.740> though<00:05:07.830> some<00:05:08.040> people

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
use auto going on though some people

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.620 
use auto going on though some people
hate<00:05:08.460> it<00:05:08.490> and<00:05:08.760> some<00:05:08.880> people<00:05:08.910> love<00:05:09.240> it<00:05:09.300> but<00:05:09.510> I

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
hate it and some people love it but I

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.230 
hate it and some people love it but I
tend<00:05:10.140> to<00:05:10.230> use<00:05:10.290> it<00:05:10.650> just<00:05:11.640> finally<00:05:11.940> makes<00:05:12.120> it<00:05:12.210> a

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
tend to use it just finally makes it a

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.750 
tend to use it just finally makes it a
little<00:05:12.330> bit<00:05:12.480> easier<00:05:12.780> externally<00:05:13.410> mixing<00:05:13.760> so

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
little bit easier externally mixing so

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.630 
little bit easier externally mixing so
there<00:05:15.600> we<00:05:15.720> go<00:05:15.750> very<00:05:16.170> very<00:05:16.470> straightforward<00:05:16.800> in

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
there we go very very straightforward in

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.680 
there we go very very straightforward in
terms<00:05:17.940> of<00:05:18.060> getting<00:05:18.240> that<00:05:18.300> done<00:05:18.360> now<00:05:18.540> the

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
terms of getting that done now the

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.690 
terms of getting that done now the
global<00:05:19.170> section<00:05:19.560> itself<00:05:19.890> is<00:05:20.100> quite<00:05:20.400> useful

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
global section itself is quite useful

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.280 
global section itself is quite useful
and<00:05:21.090> if<00:05:21.180> I<00:05:21.300> have<00:05:21.480> space<00:05:21.690> for<00:05:21.750> it<00:05:21.930> I<00:05:22.050> like<00:05:22.260> to

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
and if I have space for it I like to

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.410 
and if I have space for it I like to
have<00:05:22.590> it<00:05:22.740> displayed<00:05:23.160> but<00:05:23.700> as<00:05:23.820> I<00:05:23.850> say<00:05:24.120> if<00:05:24.300> I

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.420 
have it displayed but as I say if I

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.630 
have it displayed but as I say if I
don't<00:05:24.660> have<00:05:24.870> the<00:05:25.020> space<00:05:25.290> for<00:05:25.560> my<00:05:26.100> actual<00:05:26.250> decks

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640 
don't have the space for my actual decks

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.430 
don't have the space for my actual decks
then<00:05:26.910> yeah<00:05:27.270> it's<00:05:27.450> got<00:05:27.660> a<00:05:27.690> go<00:05:27.870> unfortunately

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
then yeah it's got a go unfortunately

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.500 
then yeah it's got a go unfortunately
that's<00:05:28.980> the<00:05:29.130> one<00:05:29.280> thing<00:05:29.460> that<00:05:29.640> will<00:05:29.790> be<00:05:30.030> pushed

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
that's the one thing that will be pushed

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.660 
that's the one thing that will be pushed
off<00:05:30.690> but<00:05:31.380> what<00:05:31.560> you<00:05:31.620> can<00:05:31.800> do<00:05:31.950> is<00:05:32.100> maybe<00:05:32.310> tweak

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:32.670 
off but what you can do is maybe tweak

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.700 
off but what you can do is maybe tweak
your<00:05:32.940> browser<00:05:33.360> so<00:05:33.870> for<00:05:34.020> example<00:05:34.380> get<00:05:34.500> rid<00:05:34.650> of

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
your browser so for example get rid of

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.190 
your browser so for example get rid of
the<00:05:34.890> browser<00:05:35.280> details<00:05:35.850> the<00:05:36.120> browser<00:05:36.840> error

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.200 
the browser details the browser error

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.020 
the browser details the browser error
messages<00:05:37.710> and<00:05:37.740> so<00:05:38.010> on<00:05:38.040> down<00:05:38.310> at<00:05:38.430> the<00:05:38.520> bottom<00:05:38.670> in

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030

the browser section of the preset of the

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.160 
the browser section of the preset of the
Preferences<00:05:42.420> and<00:05:42.570> that<00:05:42.780> will<00:05:42.900> give<00:05:43.020> you<00:05:43.110> a

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:43.170 
Preferences and that will give you a

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.020 
Preferences and that will give you a
little<00:05:43.350> bit<00:05:43.530> more<00:05:43.650> space<00:05:43.920> I<00:05:44.220> have<00:05:44.550> to<00:05:44.760> fit<00:05:44.910> that

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
little bit more space I have to fit that

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.240 
little bit more space I have to fit that
global<00:05:45.450> section<00:05:45.810> in<00:05:45.990> at<00:05:46.200> the<00:05:46.320> top<00:05:46.530> as<00:05:46.740> well<00:05:46.920> so

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
global section in at the top as well so

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.520 
global section in at the top as well so
as<00:05:47.910> you<00:05:48.150> can<00:05:48.270> see<00:05:48.450> there's<00:05:48.750> lots<00:05:49.110> of<00:05:49.320> ways<00:05:49.500> to

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
as you can see there's lots of ways to

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.470 
as you can see there's lots of ways to
tweak<00:05:49.890> around<00:05:50.130> with<00:05:50.520> this<00:05:50.640> you<00:05:50.910> know<00:05:51.030> you<00:05:51.090> can

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:51.480 
tweak around with this you know you can

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.720 
tweak around with this you know you can
basically<00:05:52.050> have<00:05:52.500> a<00:05:52.560> setup<00:05:52.950> for<00:05:53.250> every

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:53.730 
basically have a setup for every
