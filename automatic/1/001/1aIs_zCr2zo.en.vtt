00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:17.419
 gave you 

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:20.909
 and as you can see which one we are going to talk about the prosas pp de gijón 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.960
 As you well know in the current market we can find hair routes 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:26.619
 true 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.479
 synthetic hair prose and today we are going to look at badger hair bags 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.520
 we will also look at what characteristics we should look for in a 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.780
 bag when we go to buy it 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.410
 first I would like to tell you that in most badger bags 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.929
 I'm seeing exceeded comes from china 

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:47.400
 in China not only 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.140
 caffarel badger by his hair but also by their faces 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.570
 and as you see here in this table 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.880
 I have several things but john 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.350
 because there are certain degrees 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.820
 and badger hair d differences 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.850
 I would like to tell you that the teruel de john quality team 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.610
 nevertheless unanimously 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.930
 agreed by all brands 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.700
 but if there are some common characteristics 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.480
 of which I would like to speak to you now 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.120
 The perote juan load types from highest to lowest are 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.140
 if amuse 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.870
 a point to the silver 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.110
 super departed for homeland purposes a spanish badger white boat with two 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.320
 bands 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.539
 vespa teac that we could work in Spanish but with light gray 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.170
 antier baker 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.170
 that mirror did not leave a cigar in English 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.150
 the characteristic of each one differ 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.060
 I would like 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.450
 drowned of the brush has decided to explain 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.590
 in the silver meeting in Spanish as we can see 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.320
 it was processed they have some tips 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.090
 pretty clear 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.690
 and they are close is the consensus among all manufacturers 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.710
 travel towards him but he left a higher quality 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.020
 hair of silveti is badger's skirt 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.710
 close to highlight the neck and is a very soft dog that have like 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.930
 main feature they retain we wanted more water than the other classes 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.359
 of john's hair 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:21.170
 It usually has a darker color band as you can see here 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.709
 that cut the hair transversally 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.049
 it's also super vallespín that band 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:30.489
 but for me there are no differences between what is very superfluous 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:31.300
 silver that 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.300
 only that you walk with two sides as a know now 

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:36.299
 percent 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:42.329
 but if the Betis Suarez is very very very soft and have little firmness to me I do not 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.589
 like to use this route for example 

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:47.769
 with soaps a few stables to see it more appropriate 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.359
 for for creams 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:52.049
 It's a rose 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.340
 that if you have sensitive skin conceives that take off a luxury 

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:58.869
 but I astarte 100 euros or 250 euros in it 

00:02:59.369 --> 00:03:00.809
 it's going to be very good for you 

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:04.169
 but it does not mean it's the best dt john prose 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:10.899
 price is determined by the rarity of hair dt john that is because it is not so 

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:15.760
 easy to find this but they must of silver city apart there is very little much or 

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:18.399
 very few cassez there is country that makes is real 

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:20.870
 as we can check this route also has 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.729
 I did not pray for a forum 

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:24.459
 which is very elegant 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:25.539
 what beats 

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:27.949
 a pretty brush 

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:29.639
 interesting 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:32.439
 the second thing delage denied being and talking 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:35.569
 that for me are my favorite cities 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.009
 this is the John Patier's goal 

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:41.029
 or two as bands that is one of the best promises 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.879
 one of the best kind of hair we can against 

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:49.239
 the cinep yesterday as you can check 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.609
 he has two bands that's why he likes like humans in Spanish 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:57.269
 one of them is much darker while the joints are very clear 

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:02.529
 he usually has a hair a slightly longer than him kenshil bertie 

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:06.809
 sad but it also comes from the badger's skirt but from a 

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:09.809
 certain class of that juanes 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:12.299
 as has been said of a firmness 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.829
 gimeno has for example is to invest 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:18.209
 but the board are equally suárez what's left 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.209
 duke of the board of prose of silver struts 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.650
 may be the best choice for people who like to use 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:28.210
 so much 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.240
 I hope you join as creams 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.249
 since it is a very versatile brush 

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:35.549
 it's one thing that is wanting to want that still works 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.330
 so much to favor walls 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.149
 like to make her face juma because of the firmness of her hair 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:48.689
 costs usually usually like a little less than truly silveti but not 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:51.990
 in all cases because for example pri are used 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.449
 a badger of two bands that already majagual monday note john of high mountain 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:59.339
 It's pretty weird but I think it's more about marketing issues 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:02.420
 the next brossard we're going to talk about 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.550
 is what we call immersion in English 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:06.870
 costumes 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.650
 or also 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.300
 de jong ii pleaded 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.930
 this kind of hair 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.510
 also ask for a beer 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.610
 the tips pañella if they are a little rougher betis crisis 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.400
 count on two bands 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.680
 But it comes from the sides in Badger 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.759
 As you can see it is a hair a little darker than the silveti 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:28.350
 you can still see it 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.270
 the cross band that crossed entire 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.340
 and is that javi this class but is perfect for example for soaps 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.520
 cigars 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.020
 ok is also published in particular steel in japan I do not recommend it much the 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.509
 disbande to 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:45.749
 to make it foam the face unless you're looking 

00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:47.860
 a student brush 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.800
 it's much cheaper I was the john makumbe silver has two bands 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.169
 because this one but it's much easier to 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:58.469
 d to find 

00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:59.810
 an antiquity 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.110
 hair class for endesa 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.920
 is looking for an economic brush and that gives us good performance is a 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:07.559
 very good class of brossa 

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:09.229
 to start 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:13.169
 of the seven that you would like to talk about that is the last kind of dangers that 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:14.240
 let's talk 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.059
 this one left her a pure Jewish baker 

00:06:17.059 --> 00:06:18.339
 in English 

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:19.180
 this 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.869
 but it usually comes in the neck of men 

00:06:22.869 --> 00:06:26.360
 even of the abdomen or dewlap sendel of the badger 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.590
 It is a dog that is normally one color 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.369
 floor healed and quite foreign 

00:06:31.369 --> 00:06:35.889
 because sometimes manufacturers trim their hair the same way 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:38.889
 mckellen isaac pérez aralar at meetings not 

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:41.740
 it's a fight that does not 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.340
 that does not absorb so much water that does not retain as much water as for example has been 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.379
 written hello hotel count two bands 

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:53.250
 but the animac collects the amount of water that the nativity scene of the light gray the 

00:06:53.249 --> 00:06:54.759
 from Spain 

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:58.060
 is usually not working bands are for example 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.539
 It was costing between 20 to 22 euros 

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:06.330
 i like to use this prose put you looking for some bellows will end with 

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.770
 one left the beard for two or three days and I want to exfoliate from me 

00:07:11.399 --> 00:07:15.099
 the piolp yesterday is not recommended for people who have the skin 

00:07:15.099 --> 00:07:16.990
 extremely sensitive 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:20.759
 Marin is recommended for those who have a hard beard and a hard skin 

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:22.180
 as well 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:23.199
 as I say 

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:28.199
 it is not endemic right now my favorite is the one of john of two bands but if you have 

00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:30.520
 the opportunity to buy mates with 

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.029
 pure or it can be worth 

00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:34.339
 then let's recap
