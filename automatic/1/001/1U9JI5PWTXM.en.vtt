00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.990

so<00:01:40.920> you're<00:01:41.070> looking<00:01:41.340> for<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.520> lines<00:01:41.700> got<00:01:41.970> a

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
so you're looking for a lines got a

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.740 
so you're looking for a lines got a
longer

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
longer

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.780 
longer
it<00:01:43.960> doesn't<00:01:44.380> solve<00:01:44.560> the<00:01:44.650> presentation<00:01:45.460> it<00:01:45.670> was

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
it doesn't solve the presentation it was

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.690 
it doesn't solve the presentation it was
efficient<00:01:46.600> much

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
efficient much

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.510 
efficient much
so<00:01:47.880> there's<00:01:48.090> just<00:01:48.180> two<00:01:48.570> simple<00:01:48.930> ways<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.590> sit

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
so there's just two simple ways to sit

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.510 
so there's just two simple ways to sit
choosing<00:01:51.910> apply<00:01:52.270> for<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:52.690> idea<00:01:52.960> translation

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
choosing apply for the idea translation

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.310 
choosing apply for the idea translation
and<00:01:54.970> then<00:01:55.090> the<00:01:55.210> only<00:01:55.329> other<00:01:55.509> thing<00:01:56.020> I'd<00:01:56.140> know

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
and then the only other thing I'd know

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.190 
and then the only other thing I'd know
her

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
her

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.499 
her
and<00:01:57.560> this<00:01:57.680> is<00:01:57.799> kinda<00:01:58.130> like<00:01:58.159> the<00:01:58.460> gray<00:01:58.970> area<00:01:59.390> of

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
and this is kinda like the gray area of

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.260 
and this is kinda like the gray area of
my<00:01:59.689> vision<00:02:00.080> skyline<00:02:00.740> design<00:02:01.100> and<00:02:01.880> that<00:02:01.970> is<00:02:02.150> the

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
my vision skyline design and that is the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.490 
my vision skyline design and that is the
weight<00:02:02.479> of

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
weight of

then<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:49.989> ex<00:02:50.200> a<00:02:50.349> little<00:02:50.560> bit<00:02:50.650> of<00:02:50.769> weight

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
then the ex a little bit of weight

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.430 
then the ex a little bit of weight
really<00:02:51.250> help<00:02:51.609> to<00:02:51.760> get<00:02:51.879> out

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.440 

so<00:02:55.590> a<00:02:55.860> real<00:02:56.070> grad<00:02:56.370> is<00:02:56.610> a<00:02:56.640> great<00:02:56.940> line<00:02:57.180> for

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
so a real grad is a great line for

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.350 
so a real grad is a great line for
people<00:02:57.540> to<00:02:57.720> start<00:02:58.020> off

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
people to start off

I<00:03:01.080> think<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.350> Harper<00:03:01.800> line<00:03:01.950> is<00:03:02.100> too<00:03:02.280> much<00:03:02.460> so<00:03:02.730> a

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
I think the Harper line is too much so a

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.910 
I think the Harper line is too much so a
real<00:03:03.090> gold

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
real gold

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.120 
real gold
the<00:03:05.069> line<00:03:05.310> size<00:03:05.610> heavier

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
the line size heavier

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.560 
the line size heavier
it's<00:03:07.280> just<00:03:07.730> a<00:03:07.940> little<00:03:08.060> bit<00:03:08.270> about<00:03:08.420> the

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
it's just a little bit about the

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.780 
it's just a little bit about the
standard<00:03:09.110> has<00:03:09.620> enough<00:03:09.920> weight<00:03:10.160> there<00:03:10.430> again

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
standard has enough weight there again

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.610 
standard has enough weight there again
to<00:03:10.940> load<00:03:11.090> up
