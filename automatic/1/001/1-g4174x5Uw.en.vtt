this<00:03:07.100> season<00:03:07.340> so<00:03:07.520> I'll<00:03:07.850> be<00:03:07.970> signing<00:03:08.270> them<00:03:08.510> all

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660

with<00:03:09.170> the<00:03:09.290> exception<00:03:09.560> of<00:03:09.800> Darren<00:03:10.130> Bent

with the exception of Darren Bent

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.370 
with the exception of Darren Bent
because<00:03:10.760> I<00:03:10.940> don't<00:03:11.120> feel<00:03:11.300> like<00:03:11.510> he<00:03:11.720> justifies

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
because I don't feel like he justifies

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.350 
because I don't feel like he justifies
the<00:03:12.620> wage<00:03:12.860> that<00:03:13.130> we're<00:03:13.670> currently<00:03:13.850> paying<00:03:14.180> in

just sending on loan it's really not

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.290 
just sending on loan it's really not

just I tried to overcommit on the
defense<00:03:48.950> which<00:03:49.160> seems<00:03:49.430> to<00:03:49.640> work<00:03:49.850> pretty<00:03:49.880> well

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
defense which seems to work pretty well

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.420 
defense which seems to work pretty well
against<00:03:51.050> the<00:03:51.170> lower<00:03:51.350> rated<00:03:51.680> teams<00:03:51.890> but<00:03:52.190> they

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
against the lower rated teams but they

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.460 
against the lower rated teams but they
just<00:03:52.790> made<00:03:53.060> me<00:03:53.209> pay<00:03:53.360> for<00:03:53.420> that<00:03:53.690> and<00:03:53.930> they

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
just made me pay for that and they

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.010 
just made me pay for that and they
managed<00:03:54.770> to<00:03:54.920> tie<00:03:55.580> things<00:03:55.640> up<00:03:56.000> one<00:03:56.240> to<00:03:56.390> one<00:03:56.600> but

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
managed to tie things up one to one but

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.780 
managed to tie things up one to one but

luckily for us in the 78th minute we

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.100 
luckily for us in the 78th minute we
managed<00:03:59.060> to<00:03:59.090> go<00:03:59.209> on<00:03:59.300> the<00:03:59.360> counter-attack<00:03:59.720> and

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
managed to go on the counter-attack and

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.650

Karen<00:04:00.800> Richardson<00:04:01.190> is<00:04:01.520> looking<00:04:01.970> to<00:04:02.120> get<00:04:02.390> by

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
Karen Richardson is looking to get by

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.350 
Karen Richardson is looking to get by
this<00:04:02.720> defense<00:04:03.410> right<00:04:03.650> here<00:04:03.950> but<00:04:04.850> after<00:04:05.270> a

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
this defense right here but after a

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.840 
this defense right here but after a
couple<00:04:05.720> of<00:04:05.780> missed<00:04:05.959> opportunities<00:04:06.770> if<00:04:06.950> I<00:04:07.490> does

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
couple of missed opportunities if I does

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.640 
couple of missed opportunities if I does
finally<00:04:08.209> fall<00:04:08.420> to<00:04:08.630> Karen<00:04:08.900> Richardson<00:04:09.200> and<00:04:09.560> he

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
finally fall to Karen Richardson and he

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.620 
finally fall to Karen Richardson and he
heads<00:04:09.920> at<00:04:10.100> home<00:04:10.310> make<00:04:10.820> it<00:04:10.850> a<00:04:11.000> two<00:04:11.150> to<00:04:11.270> one<00:04:11.300> for

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
heads at home make it a two to one for

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:12.910 
heads at home make it a two to one for
us<00:04:11.720> and<00:04:11.900> I<00:04:12.110> thought<00:04:12.290> that<00:04:12.500> would<00:04:12.680> pretty<00:04:12.800> much

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
us and I thought that would pretty much

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.060 
us and I thought that would pretty much
secure<00:04:13.459> the<00:04:13.610> win<00:04:13.820> but<00:04:14.480> Coventry<00:04:15.080> City<00:04:15.320> pretty

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
secure the win but Coventry City pretty

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.860 
secure the win but Coventry City pretty
much<00:04:16.250> just<00:04:16.459> pressed<00:04:16.730> forward<00:04:17.000> and<00:04:17.239> didn't

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
much just pressed forward and didn't

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.440 
much just pressed forward and didn't
give<00:04:17.989> up<00:04:18.230> and<00:04:18.500> somehow<00:04:19.010> they<00:04:19.730> managed<00:04:20.270> to<00:04:20.299> get

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
give up and somehow they managed to get

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:21.969 
give up and somehow they managed to get
a<00:04:20.510> goal<00:04:20.780> back<00:04:21.049> pretty<00:04:21.530> much<00:04:21.620> right<00:04:21.950> after

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
a goal back pretty much right after

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:24.760 
a goal back pretty much right after
kickoff<00:04:22.550> making<00:04:23.030> it<00:04:23.150> to<00:04:23.330> 2-2<00:04:23.630> in<00:04:23.930> the<00:04:24.080> 83rd

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
kickoff making it to 2-2 in the 83rd

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.940 
kickoff making it to 2-2 in the 83rd
minute<00:04:24.940> things<00:04:25.940> weren't<00:04:26.180> over<00:04:26.419> yet

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
minute things weren't over yet

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.070

in<00:04:27.100> the<00:04:27.220> 86<00:04:27.880> minute<00:04:28.240> a<00:04:28.270> through<00:04:28.540> Paul<00:04:28.720> to<00:04:28.840> Karen

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
in the 86 minute a through Paul to Karen

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.410 
in the 86 minute a through Paul to Karen
Richardson<00:04:29.440> he<00:04:29.980> somehow<00:04:30.310> managed<00:04:30.880> to<00:04:31.000> get<00:04:31.240> to

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
Richardson he somehow managed to get to

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.810 
Richardson he somehow managed to get to
it<00:04:31.540> and<00:04:31.720> that<00:04:32.500> alone<00:04:32.830> was<00:04:33.040> an<00:04:33.190> incredible<00:04:33.640> feat

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
it and that alone was an incredible feat

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.250 
it and that alone was an incredible feat
but<00:04:34.000> then<00:04:34.120> he<00:04:34.210> just<00:04:34.510> beats<00:04:34.750> the<00:04:34.960> defender

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
but then he just beats the defender

is just an incredible player for a 74

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.430 
is just an incredible player for a 74
rated<00:04:45.790> player<00:04:46.000> I<00:04:46.270> think<00:04:46.660> that's<00:04:46.840> his<00:04:47.020> rating

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
rated player I think that's his rating

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.520 
rated player I think that's his rating
and<00:04:47.620> if<00:04:48.250> that's<00:04:48.370> the<00:04:48.520> case<00:04:48.760> he<00:04:49.120> is<00:04:49.170> just<00:04:50.170> doing

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
and if that's the case he is just doing

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.530 
and if that's the case he is just doing
so<00:04:50.740> well<00:04:50.920> this<00:04:51.070> season<00:04:51.130> and<00:04:52.000> we<00:04:52.150> did<00:04:52.330> pick<00:04:52.480> up

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
so well this season and we did pick up

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.320 
so well this season and we did pick up

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
the result and to finish up the episode

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.540 
the result and to finish up the episode
we<00:04:56.050> have<00:04:56.140> a<00:04:56.170> match<00:04:56.380> against<00:04:56.650> Chelsea<00:04:56.890> to<00:04:57.460> be

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
we have a match against Chelsea to be

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.070 
we have a match against Chelsea to be
fair<00:04:57.790> they're<00:04:57.970> underperforming<00:04:58.900> in<00:04:58.960> the

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
fair they're underperforming in the

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.170 
fair they're underperforming in the
league<00:04:59.290> only<00:04:59.890> five<00:05:00.130> points<00:05:00.520> in<00:05:00.640> four<00:05:00.910> games

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
league only five points in four games

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.660 
league only five points in four games
but<00:05:01.600> their<00:05:01.780> lineup<00:05:02.260> is<00:05:02.500> just<00:05:03.190> as<00:05:03.310> strong<00:05:03.460> as

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:03.670 
but their lineup is just as strong as

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.340 
but their lineup is just as strong as
ever<00:05:03.850> with<00:05:04.180> the<00:05:04.300> exception<00:05:04.750> that<00:05:04.780> they<00:05:04.990> don't

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
ever with the exception that they don't

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.890 
ever with the exception that they don't
have<00:05:05.680> eaten<00:05:06.100> hazard<00:05:06.670> believe<00:05:07.270> they<00:05:07.420> sold<00:05:07.780> them

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
have eaten hazard believe they sold them

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.600 
have eaten hazard believe they sold them
at<00:05:08.020> the<00:05:08.170> start<00:05:08.410> of<00:05:08.500> the<00:05:08.560> season<00:05:08.800> so<00:05:09.340> that's

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
at the start of the season so that's

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.850 
at the start of the season so that's
really<00:05:10.030> the<00:05:10.180> only<00:05:10.210> change<00:05:10.720> in<00:05:10.990> Chelsea's

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
really the only change in Chelsea's

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.260 
really the only change in Chelsea's
lineup<00:05:12.250> and<00:05:12.400> they<00:05:12.460> haven't<00:05:12.700> really<00:05:13.090> brought

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
lineup and they haven't really brought

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.730 
lineup and they haven't really brought
in<00:05:13.450> a<00:05:13.540> player<00:05:14.460> to<00:05:15.460> uh<00:05:15.490> I<00:05:15.990> guess<00:05:16.990> mitigate<00:05:17.530> that

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
in a player to uh I guess mitigate that

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.670 
in a player to uh I guess mitigate that
change<00:05:18.180> but<00:05:19.180> here<00:05:19.420> Jack<00:05:19.720> really<00:05:20.140> does<00:05:20.530> get

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
change but here Jack really does get

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.560 
change but here Jack really does get
fouled<00:05:20.980> by<00:05:21.160> Evanovich<00:05:21.640> I<00:05:21.940> didn't<00:05:22.300> show<00:05:22.420> the

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
fouled by Evanovich I didn't show the

fouled by Evanovich I didn't show the
earlier<00:05:22.900> yellow<00:05:23.170> card<00:05:23.500> he<00:05:23.560> picked<00:05:23.800> up<00:05:23.950> but<00:05:24.100> I

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
earlier yellow card he picked up but I

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.610 
earlier yellow card he picked up but I
guess<00:05:24.250> he<00:05:24.610> guys<00:05:24.790> can<00:05:25.060> expect<00:05:25.510> what's<00:05:26.140> coming

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
guess he guys can expect what's coming

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.350 
guess he guys can expect what's coming
Ivanovich<00:05:27.250> picks<00:05:27.490> up<00:05:27.610> a<00:05:27.700> second<00:05:28.090> yellow<00:05:28.240> card

and is sent off in the 21st minute so

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.170 
and is sent off in the 21st minute so
that<00:05:32.470> was<00:05:32.650> a<00:05:32.680> huge<00:05:32.950> opportunity<00:05:33.370> for<00:05:33.730> us<00:05:33.940> to

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
that was a huge opportunity for us to

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.320 
that was a huge opportunity for us to
break<00:05:34.780> through<00:05:35.050> the<00:05:35.260> 10-man<00:05:35.680> Chelsea<00:05:36.310> and<00:05:36.520> try
