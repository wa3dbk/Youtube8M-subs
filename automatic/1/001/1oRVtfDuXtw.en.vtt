00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:30.550
 way to have a mixture is homogeneous or 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:33.250
 at salty cried come now we 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.330
 will put our chicken pieces in 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.990
 this marinade 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:40.360
 so if you have pieces of 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.560
 chicken like this with where there is the 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.820
 little wing tip and more so you 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.710
 take the air and you pass it over 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.070
 that's the way we're going to put it 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.990
 in 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:53.070
 hop we'll cover it with marinade 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.030
 that it is well soaked everywhere 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.830
 and I 'm going to put it in a corner 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.900
 if I will continue with the others 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.240
 now I had filmed the play with a 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.480
 food film and store it at 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.580
 fridge for two hours well this 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.129
 it's been two hours since our chicken wings 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.430
 well marine in the marinade in the fridge 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:13.629
 so I took them out 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.300
 so let's see a little bit 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:16.770
 looks like a past they are well soaked 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.260
 there no problem then now 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.740
 the operation is very simple we will 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.270
 take 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.970
 we will listen to them a little bit and we will 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.610
 put them on a war that will go 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.860
 baked then baked well in paris I 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.870
 already prepared a drip tray that is going to be 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.220
 underneath which will collect well the 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.220
 tide remains date that will sink 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.390
 during cooking 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.430
 regularly I will take a brush and 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.110
 I basij would give a little marinade 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.940
 on my chicken wings to make sure 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.880
 that they are well there that is the 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.550
 oven is preheating at 180 degrees 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.740
 so I'm going to bake them for 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.140
 take five to forty minutes in 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.120
 returning from time to time forty 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.070
 minutes later our chicken wings 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.030
 are cooked so I took them out of 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.460
 emulated in a serving dish 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.620
 so during all cooking I am 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.880
 come regularly to add them to the 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.370
 marinade on and brush them 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.290
 using a with a brush 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.880
 well they are cooked there is no 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:17.090
 worry it looks really good it smells 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.090
 super good there is more than going to table
