Hazuki<00:01:05.670> she<00:01:06.090> loses<00:01:07.760> well<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:08.790> guess<00:01:09.299> it's<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.570> be

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
Hazuki she loses well I guess it's to be

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:10.460 
Hazuki she loses well I guess it's to be
expected

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
expected

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.859 
expected
she<00:01:11.369> just<00:01:11.549> recently<00:01:12.000> started<00:01:12.270> playing<00:01:12.659> her

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
she just recently started playing her

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.810 
she just recently started playing her
musical<00:01:13.229> instruments<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:13.979> for<00:01:14.250> her<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.400> lose

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
musical instruments so for her to lose

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.399 
musical instruments so for her to lose
it<00:01:15.150> kind<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.390> makes<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.630> lot<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.869> sense<00:01:16.200> it

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
it kind of makes a lot of sense it

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.950 
it kind of makes a lot of sense it
really<00:01:16.590> does<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:18.210> guess<00:01:18.450> it's<00:01:18.720> more

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
really does so I guess it's more

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.039 
really does so I guess it's more
realistic<00:01:19.470> in<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:20.009> regard<00:01:20.600> but<00:01:21.600> what<00:01:21.900> was

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
realistic in that regard but what was

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.840 
realistic in that regard but what was
really<00:01:22.409> sad<00:01:22.740> was<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.310> other<00:01:23.430> girl<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.790> way

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.440 
embarrassing if so I'll just walk to
your<00:03:21.250> room<00:03:21.400> and<00:03:21.520> did<00:03:21.640> something<00:03:21.940> like<00:03:22.060> that<00:03:22.120> to

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
your room and did something like that to

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.210 
your room and did something like that to
you<00:03:22.570> so<00:03:22.930> those<00:03:23.110> are<00:03:23.260> the<00:03:23.410> two<00:03:23.770> highlight

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
you so those are the two highlight

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.770 
you so those are the two highlight
points<00:03:24.580> of<00:03:24.670> the<00:03:24.760> episode<00:03:25.090> besides<00:03:25.390> scene<00:03:25.600> of

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
points of the episode besides scene of

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.410 
points of the episode besides scene of
the<00:03:25.870> URI<00:03:26.080> moment<00:03:26.470> I<00:03:26.620> guess<00:03:26.920> three<00:03:27.280> big<00:03:27.970> points

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
the URI moment I guess three big points

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.720 
the URI moment I guess three big points
on<00:03:28.690> this<00:03:28.810> episode<00:03:29.110> I<00:03:29.380> really<00:03:29.440> enjoyed<00:03:30.400> a<00:03:30.430> lot

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:31.890 
on this episode I really enjoyed a lot
especially<00:03:31.030> when<00:03:31.390> it<00:03:31.450> came<00:03:31.540> to<00:03:31.600> like<00:03:31.780> the

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
especially when it came to like the

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.470 
especially when it came to like the
animation<00:03:32.260> seeds<00:03:33.070> that<00:03:33.190> just<00:03:33.430> really<00:03:33.790> piqued

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
animation seeds that just really piqued

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.500 
animation seeds that just really piqued
my<00:03:34.570> interest<00:03:34.890> so<00:03:35.890> in<00:03:36.250> terms<00:03:36.700> of<00:03:37.030> what<00:03:37.420> this

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
my interest so in terms of what this

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.420 
my interest so in terms of what this
episode<00:03:37.930> stood<00:03:38.200> for<00:03:38.440> I<00:03:38.620> guess<00:03:38.920> he<00:03:39.100> gave<00:03:39.220> us<00:03:39.340> a

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.950 
episode stood for I guess he gave us a
lot<00:03:39.550> of<00:03:39.610> different<00:03:39.970> information<00:03:40.180> on<00:03:40.600> certain

we saw a couple episodes back when Rey

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.160 
we saw a couple episodes back when Rey
know<00:03:54.700> she<00:03:54.760> was<00:03:55.030> praising<00:03:55.570> the<00:03:55.660> teacher<00:03:55.900> and<00:03:56.110> at

know she was praising the teacher and at

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.540 
know she was praising the teacher and at
first<00:03:56.410> when<00:03:56.680> I<00:03:56.770> first<00:03:56.800> saw<00:03:57.130> the<00:03:57.190> volume

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
first when I first saw the volume

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.430 
first when I first saw the volume
majority<00:03:58.060> of<00:03:58.120> us<00:03:58.240> when<00:03:58.420> we<00:03:58.630> saw<00:03:58.930> it<00:03:59.110> we

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
majority of us when we saw it we

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.410 
majority of us when we saw it we
probably<00:03:59.740> assumed<00:04:00.190> that<00:04:00.340> Reyna<00:04:00.610> was<00:04:00.910> in<00:04:01.090> love

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
probably assumed that Reyna was in love

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.940 
probably assumed that Reyna was in love
with<00:04:01.750> the<00:04:01.900> teacher<00:04:02.110> that's<00:04:02.380> what<00:04:02.530> I<00:04:02.560> thought

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
with the teacher that's what I thought

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.650 
with the teacher that's what I thought
right<00:04:03.160> that's<00:04:03.430> what<00:04:03.610> I<00:04:03.670> instantly<00:04:04.360> thought

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
right that's what I instantly thought

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.270 
right that's what I instantly thought
when<00:04:05.200> I<00:04:05.230> saw<00:04:05.470> her<00:04:05.590> trying<00:04:05.830> to<00:04:05.890> praise<00:04:06.100> the

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
when I saw her trying to praise the

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.190 
when I saw her trying to praise the
teacher<00:04:06.610> and<00:04:06.730> defend<00:04:07.030> him<00:04:07.270> so<00:04:07.660> after<00:04:08.110> this

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
why Reyna defended the teacher was

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.410 
why Reyna defended the teacher was
because<00:04:11.680> he<00:04:11.800> was<00:04:11.920> some<00:04:12.130> big<00:04:12.340> hotshot<00:04:12.580> that<00:04:13.180> was

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
mean the Train CGI it doesn't look the

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.550 
mean the Train CGI it doesn't look the
best<00:04:48.790> of<00:04:49.240> course<00:04:49.390> but<00:04:49.750> compared<00:04:50.200> to<00:04:50.260> normal

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
best of course but compared to normal

best of course but compared to normal
CGI<00:04:51.040> I<00:04:51.160> usually<00:04:51.820> see<00:04:52.060> the<00:04:52.690> CGL<00:04:53.080> is<00:04:53.170> pretty<00:04:53.380> damn

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
CGI I usually see the CGL is pretty damn

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.830
