00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:26.680 
and here's the texture you want I'll

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.859 
and here's the texture you want I'll
just<00:00:27.070> trimming<00:00:27.430> right<00:00:27.640> yeah<00:00:28.000> so<00:00:28.420> I<00:00:28.480> was<00:00:28.510> your

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:28.869 
just trimming right yeah so I was your

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.650 
just trimming right yeah so I was your
trimming<00:00:29.260> it<00:00:29.380> yeah<00:00:29.890> point<00:00:30.460> cut<00:00:30.699> style<00:00:31.000> she's

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:31.660 
trimming it yeah point cut style she's

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.210 
trimming it yeah point cut style she's
getting<00:00:32.020> giving<00:00:32.439> more<00:00:32.590> texture<00:00:33.010> to<00:00:33.040> the

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.220 
getting giving more texture to the

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.390 
getting giving more texture to the
answers<00:00:33.579> their<00:00:33.850> lesson<00:00:34.329> says<00:00:34.860> me<00:00:35.860> looking<00:00:36.220> and

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.400 
answers their lesson says me looking and

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.030 
answers their lesson says me looking and

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
Romans of the far right and serve a good

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.890 
Romans of the far right and serve a good
way<00:00:44.410> down<00:00:44.649> better<00:00:44.950> to<00:00:45.329> otherwise

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.780 

if<00:00:49.830> you<00:00:49.980> don't<00:00:50.190> have<00:00:50.430> like<00:00:50.670> an<00:00:50.790> undercut<00:00:52.790> when

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
if you don't have like an undercut when

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:54.950 
if you don't have like an undercut when
we<00:00:53.880> leave<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.060> line<00:00:54.300> then<00:00:54.570> it's<00:00:54.690> more<00:00:54.810> like<00:00:54.930> a

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
we leave a line then it's more like a

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.890 
we leave a line then it's more like a
bowl<00:00:55.260> cut<00:00:55.940> bowl<00:00:56.940> cuts<00:00:57.270> don't<00:00:57.570> lay<00:00:57.690> down

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:57.900 
bowl cut bowl cuts don't lay down

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.400 
bowl cut bowl cuts don't lay down
undercuts<00:00:58.860> do<00:00:59.510> and<00:01:00.510> then<00:01:00.630> just<00:01:00.870> continue<00:01:01.020> to

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
undercuts do and then just continue to

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.580 
undercuts do and then just continue to
texturize<00:01:02.070> back<00:01:02.900> here<00:01:03.900> those<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.350> gotta

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:04.590 
texturize back here those you gotta

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.680 
texturize back here those you gotta
people<00:01:05.309> turn<00:01:05.490> to<00:01:05.520> the<00:01:05.670> chin<00:01:05.850> like<00:01:06.000> them<00:01:06.180> you've

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
people turn to the chin like them you've

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.090 
people turn to the chin like them you've
gotta<00:01:06.990> comb<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.440> hair<00:01:07.560> down<00:01:08.000> wet<00:01:09.650> so<00:01:10.650> kind<00:01:11.010> of

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
gotta comb the hair down wet so kind of

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.740 
gotta comb the hair down wet so kind of
sick<00:01:11.340> work<00:01:11.580> naturally<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:12.150> going<00:01:12.300> to<00:01:12.360> be<00:01:12.510> and

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
sick work naturally is going to be and

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.010 
sick work naturally is going to be and
then<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.080> extra<00:01:13.560> little<00:01:13.740> bit<00:01:14.510> to<00:01:15.510> see<00:01:15.720> here<00:01:15.990> I

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
then the extra little bit to see here I

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.900 
then the extra little bit to see here I
don't<00:01:16.260> know<00:01:16.320> if<00:01:16.410> it<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:17.280> can't<00:01:17.550> it's<00:01:17.880> just

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:17.910 
don't know if it is I can't it's just

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.270 
don't know if it is I can't it's just
this<00:01:18.150> extra<00:01:18.540> bits<00:01:18.840> going<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.080> thin<00:01:19.830> out<00:01:19.980> and

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
this extra bits going to thin out and

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.230 
this extra bits going to thin out and
take<00:01:20.520> out<00:01:20.810> so<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.960> still<00:01:22.260> got<00:01:22.410> that<00:01:22.440> good

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
take out so you still got that good

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.850 
take out so you still got that good
texture<00:01:24.240> but<00:01:24.869> you're<00:01:25.020> not<00:01:25.140> cleaning<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.740> up

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
texture but you're not cleaning it up

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.170 
texture but you're not cleaning it up
short<00:01:26.190> like<00:01:26.400> I'll<00:01:26.550> prove<00:01:26.729> any<00:01:26.910> of<00:01:26.970> the

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
short like I'll prove any of the

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.940 
short like I'll prove any of the
Clippers<00:01:27.590> and<00:01:28.590> in<00:01:28.740> there<00:01:30.590> and<00:01:31.590> then<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.800> just

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
Clippers and in there and then you just

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.450 
Clippers and in there and then you just
continue<00:01:32.720> reading<00:01:33.720> your<00:01:34.020> hand<00:01:34.280> all<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.430> way

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
continue reading your hand all the way

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.600 
continue reading your hand all the way
around<00:01:36.320> and<00:01:37.320> do<00:01:37.440> the<00:01:37.560> same<00:01:37.800> thing<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.369> can

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
around and do the same thing and you can

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.060 
around and do the same thing and you can
do<00:01:38.729> this<00:01:38.910> as<00:01:39.090> well<00:01:39.300> on<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.080> bangs<00:01:40.320> and

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
do this as well on the bangs and

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.310 
do this as well on the bangs and
sideburns<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:41.940> front<00:01:42.240> because<00:01:43.050> you're

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
sideburns in the front because you're

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.770 
sideburns in the front because you're
going<00:01:43.410> to<00:01:43.500> need<00:01:43.650> to<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.119> whole<00:01:45.300> cut<00:01:45.600> and

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
going to need to so the whole cut and

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.390 
going to need to so the whole cut and
the<00:01:45.869> same<00:01:46.110> texture<00:01:46.560> all<00:01:46.650> the<00:01:46.770> way<00:01:46.860> around<00:01:46.950> the

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
the same texture all the way around the

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:53.120 
the same texture all the way around the
perimeter<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:47.910> it<00:01:51.350> and<00:01:52.350> getting<00:01:52.619> filterheadz

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
same type of a backline shape you would

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.510 
same type of a backline shape you would
normally<00:01:58.140> do<00:02:00.440> you<00:02:01.440> know<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:01.680> follow<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.250> same
