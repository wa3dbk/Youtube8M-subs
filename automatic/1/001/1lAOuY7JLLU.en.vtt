 of a good new color that is 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.500
 wonderful because it leaves hair with 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.840
 luminosity transparency 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.610
 moisturizes hair is a color 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.710
 fantastic to work on

 pre-rinse hair that is what we're going 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.640
 to be doing today and now I want them 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.280
 present the carmen zerón our 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.570
 color technique the next step in the 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.869
 coll de illumina is to apply 10 size 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.610
 38 to qualify the hair 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.250
 this is a tone that is a pearly blond 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.610
 As you can see, it's in the stage 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.880
 already clarified and now we want to clarify the 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.460
 hair so it has a bright color 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.259
 light with a lot of light will notice the 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.600
 difference quality of hair that is going 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.380
 to see well hydrated important to emphasize 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.080
 that the color illuminates has a coverage 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.970
 of awesome channel also keeps 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.700
 that luminosity that made it stand out 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.899
 because it's the one with the most properties 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.899
 important that the color has 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.580
 and now that we were 15 minutes to 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.500
 greater nuances in the hair then 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.500
 we wash and process alcohol 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.299
 and here we have the hair totally 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.190
 tinged with right-handed tone and 38 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:28.849
 look at how spectacular the 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.879
 color that a pearly blond well neutral 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:34.099
 and now you are in totana that you go to 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:36.680
 cut that we are going to do in season that 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:38.959
 is going to be a cut comes there well avant 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.879
 garde with an effect of where with the 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:44.560
 laterals leaving the hair to 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.560
 totally long surface 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:58.450
 and here we see the avant garde cut 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:01.269
 done and we go to the next step that 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.640
 it would be color and now the next step is 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:07.629
 interesting because we're going to use 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:10.840
 illuminates the color 9-4 3 that is a blonde 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:13.150
 Coppery but as a record it is totally 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.880
 offline we will create different 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:20.280
 color panels with that coppery tone 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.670
 that we are going to apply but we are going to create 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.370
 an effect of like a veil of color 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.100
 blond so that according to the 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.620
 movement that is given to the cut the 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.020
 color will also change what is going to be 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.290
 very interesting the final effect when 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.290
 let's see it 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:06.969
 and here we have the final design I hope 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:09.159
 that you liked and until the next one 

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:11.409

 rinsed are usually opaque and without 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:19.150
 brightness with illuminates the results are 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.829
