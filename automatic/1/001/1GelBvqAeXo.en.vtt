 You're a big fan of bone 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.719
 colorado soccer on the court like 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.359
 I will be the truth I am very very 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.250
 happy because almost nothing is needed to 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.439
 that the world cup of brasilia begins 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.570
 almost nothing so that the beautiful peralta 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.760
 while his first goal against Cameroon in 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.099
 end we are now to nothing that this year 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.050
 be unforgettable at the moment we are going to 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.730
 give you with all this tutorial and we are going to 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.680
 learn to sharpen your aim that only 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.570
 I'll tell you one thing just for 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.180
 that you cheer and check this video if you 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.690
 you do not have much condition you are not fast 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.770
 never sometimes well do not hit with the 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.690
 two legs 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.360
 Finally, you do not have many things 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.140
 good to play but if you have good 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.059
 aim for the holder of the same 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.039
 Czech so this video will not 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.039
 you stay on the bench let's start 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:22.130
 the secret is in practice not because 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.130
 put it once in the hoop 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.960
 you're going to say that you're going to put it there 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.960
 the times you want 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.569
 If you already got to put it in the hoop or 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.429
 hitting some object returns to 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:48.189
 try it and paste the times that more 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:50.079
 you can so you will perfect and 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:53.340
 educating your foot so you can put 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:53.340
 the ball wherever 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.380
 after she practices putting 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.810
 the ball many times in the same 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.660
 place what follows is the size so that 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.430
 see that size does matter to size 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:21.090
 I mean, first you put on a 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:23.840
 big goal since you gave it vÃ©lez 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.840
 reducing the size 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:47.790
 and so on and so on until you hit 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.790
 practically an ant 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.700
 ok we already saw the size now let's see 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.670
 Distance is not the same as putting the 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.430
 ball does not hit the crossbar from here to 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.439
 hit him from here 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.569
 an exercise that will help you measure your 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:11.000
 distance and your shooting power is this 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:13.790
 you can wear maybe four or five 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.560
 goals or distances the joke is 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.069
 hit the crossbar from the first 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.560
 distance or the nearest one try it 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:24.170
 until you hit him since you gave him a go 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:29.170
 at distance 2 then at distance 3 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.170
 and so on and then back 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.540
 or not 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.230
 believe me it will help you a lot to measure 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.310
 strength in your shots and especially to 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.310
 improve your aim 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.409
 Y 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:25.139
 then already improvements that your aim 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:27.330
 sticking to the same goal many 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:28.830
 times since you were hitting gradually 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.870
 until you reduce your goal to 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.849
 practically nothing, you gave me the 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.469
 distance and strength at the moment of 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:37.499
 hit him only is to give him the last 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:40.129
 polished to your aim practice it in 

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:40.129
 movement 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:46.449
 now imagine if you are a starter you hit 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.210
 good with both legs 

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:52.090
 you know how to nod correctly you're fast 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:55.030
 and you put the ball where you hit the 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:57.400
 wins millionaire contract I'll take it 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:59.379
 they will be a chulada of players like no 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.330
 but good, I say goodbye and I hope you put 

00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:03.430
 in practice these humble tips that
