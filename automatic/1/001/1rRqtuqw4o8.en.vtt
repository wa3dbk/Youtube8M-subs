00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
see pretty well you've got there just

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.790 
see pretty well you've got there just
through<00:00:43.100> a<00:00:43.190> just<00:00:43.460> like<00:00:43.609> on<00:00:43.940> a<00:00:43.999> push<00:00:44.239> body<00:00:44.800> the

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
through a just like on a push body the

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.610 
through a just like on a push body the
cable<00:00:47.350> really<00:00:48.350> not<00:00:48.499> through<00:00:48.739> the<00:00:49.460> under<00:00:49.699> tray

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
cable really not through the under tray

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.989 
cable really not through the under tray
that<00:00:51.620> is<00:00:52.120> attached<00:00:53.120> to<00:00:53.300> a<00:00:53.479> bar<00:00:53.960> here<00:00:54.530> but

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:54.999 
that is attached to a bar here but

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:59.379 
that is attached to a bar here but
inside<00:00:55.999> that<00:00:56.239> bar<00:00:57.069> is<00:00:58.069> like<00:00:58.339> a<00:00:58.370> spring<00:00:58.909> it

00:00:59.379 --> 00:00:59.389 
inside that bar is like a spring it

00:00:59.389 --> 00:01:01.869 
inside that bar is like a spring it
you've<00:00:59.600> got<00:00:59.719> the<00:00:59.809> spring<00:01:00.019> which<00:01:00.769> one<00:01:01.159> one<00:01:01.670> side

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
you've got the spring which one one side

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.229 
you've got the spring which one one side
of<00:01:01.969> the<00:01:02.120> spring<00:01:02.269> runs<00:01:02.629> this<00:01:03.050> way<00:01:03.309> and<00:01:04.309> then<00:01:04.580> the

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
of the spring runs this way and then the

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.560 
of the spring runs this way and then the
other<00:01:05.269> side<00:01:05.630> of<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:05.900> spring<00:01:06.110> runs<00:01:06.530> that<00:01:07.220> way

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.140 

so<00:01:11.570> it<00:01:11.690> can<00:01:11.840> spring<00:01:12.080> back<00:01:12.320> and<00:01:12.500> forth<00:01:13.150> about

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
so it can spring back and forth about

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.430 
so it can spring back and forth about
that<00:01:14.210> bar<00:01:14.630> welded<00:01:14.900> on<00:01:15.230> with<00:01:15.680> the<00:01:15.770> cable<00:01:16.190> just

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
that bar welded on with the cable just

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.150 
that bar welded on with the cable just
pull<00:01:18.440> tied<00:01:18.740> to<00:01:19.730> that<00:01:20.470> but<00:01:21.470> this<00:01:21.620> is<00:01:21.860> this

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
pull tied to that but this is this

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.180 
pull tied to that but this is this
bracket<00:01:22.640> is<00:01:22.670> gonna<00:01:22.880> hinge<00:01:23.230> here<00:01:24.230> straight<00:01:24.890> the

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
bracket is gonna hinge here straight the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:33.520 
bracket is gonna hinge here straight the
way<00:01:25.340> through<00:01:26.680> all<00:01:27.680> the<00:01:27.740> way<00:01:27.980> through<00:01:32.320> plate<00:01:33.320> is

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
way through all the way through plate is

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.290 
way through all the way through plate is
mounted<00:01:33.710> on<00:01:34.010> the<00:01:34.040> back<00:01:34.220> of<00:01:34.370> that<00:01:34.460> one<00:01:35.410> there

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300

you how it works if you can see the

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.710 
you how it works if you can see the
leaver<00:01:55.180> right<00:01:56.210> there's<00:01:57.200> a<00:01:57.290> leaver<00:01:57.500> for<00:01:57.830> it

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
leaver right there's a leaver for it

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.080 
leaver right there's a leaver for it
it's<00:01:59.720> a<00:01:59.780> lock<00:01:59.990> lever<00:02:00.290> so<00:02:00.920> the<00:02:01.790> pin<00:02:02.030> on<00:02:02.180> it<00:02:02.210> here

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
it's a lock lever so the pin on it here

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.020 
it's a lock lever so the pin on it here
if<00:02:05.090> I<00:02:05.240> squeeze<00:02:05.600> do<00:02:05.900> believe<00:02:06.440> it<00:02:06.590> ain't<00:02:07.030> that

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
if I squeeze do believe it ain't that

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.680 
if I squeeze do believe it ain't that
pinned<00:02:08.530> pop<00:02:09.530> site<00:02:09.789> which<00:02:10.789> Eliza<00:02:11.150> leave<00:02:11.450> it<00:02:11.599> to

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
pinned pop site which Eliza leave it to

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:25.650 
pinned pop site which Eliza leave it to
go<00:02:11.810> back<00:02:12.670> just<00:02:13.670> in<00:02:13.940> that<00:02:15.010> things<00:02:17.230> playoff<00:02:19.120> see

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.590 

obviously<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:27.200> harder<00:02:27.860> you<00:02:28.360> squeeze<00:02:29.360> the

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
obviously the harder you squeeze the

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.930 
obviously the harder you squeeze the
lever<00:02:29.750> and<00:02:30.110> flip<00:02:30.770> the<00:02:30.890> plate<00:02:31.130> real<00:02:31.550> quick

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
lever and flip the plate real quick

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.540 
lever and flip the plate real quick
release<00:02:32.480> it<00:02:32.690> quick<00:02:34.720> debates<00:02:35.720> on<00:02:36.310> how<00:02:37.310> much

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
release it quick debates on how much

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:43.840 
release it quick debates on how much
behind<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:38.630> bike<00:02:38.870> that<00:02:39.110> you<00:02:39.319> can<00:02:39.350> see<00:02:42.700> you<00:02:43.700> can

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
behind the bike that you can see you can

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.430 
behind the bike that you can see you can
probably<00:02:44.090> spend<00:02:44.569> a<00:02:44.630> little<00:02:44.750> bit<00:02:44.930> more<00:02:45.020> time<00:02:45.410> in

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
probably spend a little bit more time in

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.570 
probably spend a little bit more time in
doing<00:02:48.440> a<00:02:48.470> little<00:02:48.770> bit<00:02:48.890> better<00:02:49.300> but<00:02:50.300> it's<00:02:50.600> my

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
doing a little bit better but it's my

00:02:51.580 --> 00:03:00.430 
doing a little bit better but it's my
first<00:02:52.580> attempt<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:54.620> flip<00:02:54.890> play<00:02:59.380> show<00:03:00.380> you

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:45.070 

that's<00:03:38.130> it<00:03:38.310> really

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.930 

ideally<00:03:46.080> though<00:03:46.260> where<00:03:47.250> it<00:03:47.400> is<00:03:47.520> there<00:03:47.790> it's

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
ideally though where it is there it's

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
it's actually hidden behind my my leg so

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.509 
it's actually hidden behind my my leg so
it's<00:03:54.840> a<00:03:54.900> bit<00:03:55.050> of<00:03:55.080> a<00:03:55.230> hello<00:03:55.680> metal<00:03:56.099> clip<00:03:56.310> it<00:03:56.430> up

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
it's a bit of a hello metal clip it up

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.900 
it's a bit of a hello metal clip it up
when<00:03:56.910> you're<00:03:57.900> riding<00:03:58.170> we<00:03:59.129> can<00:03:59.310> get<00:03:59.489> a<00:03:59.519> longer

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
when you're riding we can get a longer

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.900 
when you're riding we can get a longer
cable<00:04:00.560> and<00:04:01.560> mount<00:04:01.890> it<00:04:02.099> up<00:04:02.190> on<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:02.489> front<00:04:02.670> of

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
cable and mount it up on the front of

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.280 
cable and mount it up on the front of
the<00:04:02.970> bike<00:04:03.180> somewhere<00:04:03.870> I<00:04:05.330> don't<00:04:06.330> know<00:04:06.510> below

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
the bike somewhere I don't know below

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.030 
the bike somewhere I don't know below
where<00:04:07.590> you<00:04:08.430> can't<00:04:08.760> even<00:04:09.030> might<00:04:09.420> be<00:04:09.660> a<00:04:10.040> good

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
where you can't even might be a good

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.449 
where you can't even might be a good
idea<00:04:12.470> which<00:04:13.470> you<00:04:13.620> probably<00:04:13.830> will<00:04:14.069> get<00:04:14.250> naked

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
idea which you probably will get naked

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:15.830 
idea which you probably will get naked
up<00:04:14.640> there<00:04:14.819> as<00:04:14.940> soon<00:04:14.970> as<00:04:15.209> a<00:04:15.299> little<00:04:15.569> on<00:04:15.720> your
