here that's going to the tree is

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.549 
here that's going to the tree is
absolutely<00:00:44.190> saturated<00:00:44.930> as<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.079> can<00:00:46.170> see<00:00:46.350> it's

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
this has been absolutely wikked through

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.220 
this has been absolutely wikked through
we<00:00:56.160> water<00:00:56.690> all<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:58.230> way<00:00:58.379> down<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:59.460> here

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
we water all the way down to here

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.509 
we water all the way down to here
obviously<00:01:01.230> we<00:01:01.649> can't<00:01:02.280> wick<00:01:02.520> any<00:01:02.730> further<00:01:04.519> and

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
obviously we can't wick any further and

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.890 
obviously we can't wick any further and
just<00:01:06.270> for<00:01:06.510> added<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:08.630> resistance<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.810> the

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
just for added and resistance to the

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.070 
just for added and resistance to the
water<00:01:11.240> the<00:01:12.240> other<00:01:12.360> carabiner<00:01:12.930> here

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
water the other carabiner here

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.929 
water the other carabiner here
don't<00:01:16.080> use<00:01:16.320> cheap<00:01:16.650> carabiners<00:01:17.520> they<00:01:17.759> won't

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
don't use cheap carabiners they won't

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.480 
don't use cheap carabiners they won't
last<00:01:18.180> these<00:01:18.840> ones<00:01:19.580> the<00:01:20.580> real<00:01:21.509> McCoy<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.490> think

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
last these ones the real McCoy I think

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.359 
last these ones the real McCoy I think
the<00:01:23.610> Kospi<00:01:24.200> $6.99<00:01:26.990> and<00:01:27.990> as<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.439> can<00:01:28.619> see<00:01:28.829> this

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
the Kospi $6.99 and as you can see this

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.969 
the Kospi $6.99 and as you can see this
piece<00:01:29.640> here<00:01:30.470> it's<00:01:31.470> completely<00:01:32.159> dry

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
piece here it's completely dry

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.460 
piece here it's completely dry
absolutely<00:01:34.979> dry<00:01:35.659> most<00:01:36.659> people<00:01:36.990> get<00:01:37.140> problems

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
absolutely dry most people get problems

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.770 
absolutely dry most people get problems
if<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.280> if<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.880> string<00:01:39.150> got<00:01:39.270> with<00:01:39.420> just<00:01:39.659> the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
if the if the string got with just the

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.249 
if the if the string got with just the
webbing<00:01:40.110> they<00:01:41.100> get<00:01:41.310> wet<00:01:41.520> here<00:01:41.880> on<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.899> end<00:01:43.049> of

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
webbing they get wet here on the end of

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.830 
webbing they get wet here on the end of
the<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:44.009> hammock<00:01:44.310> which<00:01:45.000> we<00:01:45.299> really<00:01:45.720> don't

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
the the hammock which we really don't

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.889 
the the hammock which we really don't
want<00:01:46.460> anyway<00:01:47.460> move<00:01:47.790> around<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.060> think<00:01:48.299> moving

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
want anyway move around I think moving

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.969 
want anyway move around I think moving
down

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.710 

as<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.100> can<00:01:53.220> see<00:01:55.940> what's<00:01:56.940> the<00:01:57.120> water<00:01:57.330> on<00:01:57.570> the

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
as you can see what's the water on the

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:04.980 
as you can see what's the water on the
top

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.889 

and<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:06.759> other<00:02:06.909> end<00:02:07.090> here<00:02:07.630> we<00:02:07.810> just<00:02:07.960> tie<00:02:08.229> knots

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
and the other end here we just tie knots

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.559 
and the other end here we just tie knots
another<00:02:10.899> not<00:02:12.000> another<00:02:13.000> knot

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
another not another knot

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.860 
another not another knot
I<00:02:13.599> always<00:02:14.290> say<00:02:14.560> we<00:02:14.680> can<00:02:14.830> adjust<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:16.390> carabiner

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
I always say we can adjust the carabiner

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.130 
I always say we can adjust the carabiner
and<00:02:17.200> clamp<00:02:18.190> it<00:02:18.370> on<00:02:18.489> here<00:02:18.790> if<00:02:19.690> you<00:02:19.870> want<00:02:20.020> some

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
and clamp it on here if you want some

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.860 
and clamp it on here if you want some
extra<00:02:20.260> tension<00:02:20.680> I<00:02:21.160> can<00:02:21.610> clamp<00:02:22.120> it<00:02:22.330> off<00:02:22.480> between

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
extra tension I can clamp it off between

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.589 
extra tension I can clamp it off between
this<00:02:23.050> point<00:02:23.290> here<00:02:23.790> very<00:02:24.790> straightforward

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
this point here very straightforward

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.309 
this point here very straightforward
same<00:02:26.530> so<00:02:26.769> up<00:02:26.830> here<00:02:27.540> you<00:02:28.540> see<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:28.810> dark<00:02:29.050> color

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
same so up here you see the dark color

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.839 
same so up here you see the dark color
there<00:02:29.560> it's<00:02:29.800> wet<00:02:30.450> on<00:02:31.450> to<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:31.780> next<00:02:31.989> one

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
there it's wet on to the next one

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.430 
there it's wet on to the next one
that's<00:02:33.849> the<00:02:33.970> birdbath<00:02:34.180> by<00:02:34.630> the<00:02:34.690> way<00:02:34.900> in<00:02:35.230> the

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
that's the birdbath by the way in the

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.120 
that's the birdbath by the way in the
garden<00:02:35.849> okay<00:02:36.849> so<00:02:36.910> anyone<00:02:37.269> was<00:02:37.450> wondering<00:02:38.130> and

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
garden okay so anyone was wondering and

see<00:02:43.450> the<00:02:43.569> contrast<00:02:44.730> dark<00:02:45.730> green<00:02:46.000> wet<00:02:46.650> it's<00:02:47.650> it

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
see the contrast dark green wet it's it

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:52.830 
see the contrast dark green wet it's it
completely<00:02:48.310> dry<00:02:50.819> and<00:02:51.819> very<00:02:52.299> novel<00:02:52.569> way<00:02:52.810> of

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
completely dry and very novel way of

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.050 
completely dry and very novel way of
setting<00:02:53.799> this<00:02:53.920> up<00:02:54.100> in<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.370> garden<00:02:54.670> by<00:02:54.819> the<00:02:54.880> way

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
setting this up in the garden by the way

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.789 
setting this up in the garden by the way
I<00:02:55.890> couldn't<00:02:56.890> get<00:02:57.069> the<00:02:57.190> height<00:02:58.019> on<00:02:59.019> that<00:02:59.319> end<00:02:59.530> so

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
I couldn't get the height on that end so

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.920 
I couldn't get the height on that end so
you<00:03:00.610> can<00:03:00.910> see<00:03:01.060> those<00:03:01.180> ladders<00:03:01.420> are<00:03:01.660> actually

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
you can see those ladders are actually

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.250 
you can see those ladders are actually
floating<00:03:02.170> in<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:02.680> air<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:04.360> tie<00:03:04.720> it<00:03:04.840> onto<00:03:04.989> the

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
floating in the air and tie it onto the

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.060 
floating in the air and tie it onto the
ladders<00:03:06.180> at<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:07.330> anchor<00:03:07.690> point<00:03:08.010> there<00:03:09.010> you

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
ladders at the anchor point there you

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.250 
ladders at the anchor point there you
can<00:03:09.190> see<00:03:09.400> there<00:03:09.670> and<00:03:10.570> on<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.840> other<00:03:10.930> side<00:03:11.230> of

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
can see there and on the other side of
