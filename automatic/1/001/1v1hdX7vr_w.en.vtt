00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
come out of you stand here look into

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.520 
come out of you stand here look into
your<00:02:59.220> map<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.730> then<00:02:59.880> boom<00:03:00.090> they<00:03:00.270> spawn<00:03:00.570> ok<00:03:00.960> now

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
your map and then boom they spawn ok now

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.550 
your map and then boom they spawn ok now
you<00:03:01.950> over<00:03:02.400> here<00:03:02.610> shoot<00:03:03.360> them<00:03:03.510> all<00:03:03.720> now

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
you over here shoot them all now

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.950 
you over here shoot them all now
unfortunately<00:03:05.250> in<00:03:05.850> this<00:03:06.030> video<00:03:06.360> I<00:03:06.660> did<00:03:06.810> not

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
unfortunately in this video I did not

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.870 
unfortunately in this video I did not
get<00:03:07.110> anything<00:03:07.500> but<00:03:08.100> I<00:03:08.160> only<00:03:08.370> do<00:03:08.550> it<00:03:08.580> two<00:03:08.850> times

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
get anything but I only do it two times

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.170 
get anything but I only do it two times
so<00:03:09.420> that's<00:03:09.630> probably<00:03:09.900> why<00:03:10.260> I<00:03:10.580> did<00:03:11.580> this<00:03:11.760> 30

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
so that's probably why I did this 30

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.870 
so that's probably why I did this 30
minutes<00:03:12.870> straight<00:03:13.830> just<00:03:14.280> to<00:03:14.400> check<00:03:14.580> it<00:03:14.760> out

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
minutes straight just to check it out

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.700 
minutes straight just to check it out
and<00:03:15.180> I<00:03:15.990> got<00:03:16.320> to<00:03:16.530> Purple's<00:03:17.010> five<00:03:17.850> blue<00:03:18.210> egg<00:03:18.360> Rams

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
and I got to Purple's five blue egg Rams

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.730 
and I got to Purple's five blue egg Rams
20<00:03:19.710> on<00:03:19.860> commons<00:03:20.570> which<00:03:21.570> is<00:03:21.750> pretty<00:03:21.960> pretty<00:03:22.440> I

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
20 on commons which is pretty pretty I

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.730 
20 on commons which is pretty pretty I
mean<00:03:22.920> to<00:03:23.790> Purple's<00:03:24.420> is<00:03:24.660> really<00:03:25.050> good<00:03:25.260> its

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
mean to Purple's is really good its

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.310 
mean to Purple's is really good its
outstanding<00:03:26.100> I<00:03:27.000> think<00:03:27.780> this<00:03:27.870> might<00:03:27.930> be<00:03:28.140> the

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
outstanding I think this might be the

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:34.340 
outstanding I think this might be the
faster<00:03:28.860> than<00:03:29.550> even<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:31.070> first<00:03:33.110> n-gram<00:03:34.110> one

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
faster than even the first n-gram one

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.060 
faster than even the first n-gram one
with<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.880> look<00:03:35.880> cave<00:03:36.120> farming<00:03:36.870> but<00:03:37.560> this<00:03:37.920> is

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
with the look cave farming but this is

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.860 
with the look cave farming but this is
really<00:03:38.220> good<00:03:38.490> see<00:03:38.820> you<00:03:39.120> see<00:03:39.270> them<00:03:39.420> spawn<00:03:39.690> up

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
really good see you see them spawn up

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.410 
really good see you see them spawn up
there<00:03:40.080> now<00:03:40.740> you<00:03:40.800> go<00:03:40.980> back<00:03:41.010> up<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:41.640> the<00:03:42.210> real

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
there now you go back up and the real

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.620 
there now you go back up and the real
quick<00:03:42.630> I<00:03:43.580> swear<00:03:44.580> this<00:03:44.790> is<00:03:44.970> one<00:03:45.180> of<00:03:45.270> the<00:03:45.330> best

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
quick I swear this is one of the best

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.950 
quick I swear this is one of the best
i've<00:03:45.960> ever<00:03:46.110> seen<00:03:46.770> so<00:03:47.460> far<00:03:47.760> and<00:03:48.090> they<00:03:48.570> have<00:03:48.750> not

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:48.960 
i've ever seen so far and they have not

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.390 
i've ever seen so far and they have not
patched<00:03:49.170> it<00:03:49.530> even<00:03:49.770> though<00:03:49.860> it<00:03:50.010> came<00:03:50.190> out<00:03:50.370> like

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
patched it even though it came out like

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.450 
patched it even though it came out like
i<00:03:50.760> think<00:03:50.970> two<00:03:51.180> days<00:03:51.360> ago<00:03:51.680> but<00:03:52.680> i<00:03:52.980> don't<00:03:53.430> know

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.460 
i think two days ago but i don't know

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.130 
i think two days ago but i don't know
why<00:03:53.640> not<00:03:53.910> a<00:03:53.940> lot<00:03:54.240> of<00:03:54.270> people<00:03:54.600> are<00:03:54.690> doing<00:03:54.990> it

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
why not a lot of people are doing it

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.740 
why not a lot of people are doing it
probably<00:03:56.100> because<00:03:56.430> i<00:03:56.760> don't<00:03:56.940> know<00:03:57.030> they<00:03:57.720> just

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
probably because i don't know they just

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.090 
probably because i don't know they just
it<00:03:58.530> just<00:03:58.680> kind<00:03:58.950> of<00:03:59.010> gave<00:03:59.190> up<00:03:59.430> on<00:04:00.650> engrams<00:04:01.650> but

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
it just kind of gave up on engrams but

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.860 
it just kind of gave up on engrams but
the<00:04:02.280> glimmer<00:04:02.580> it's<00:04:02.910> getting<00:04:03.360> packed<00:04:03.570> out<00:04:03.840> i

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
the glimmer it's getting packed out i

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.870 
the glimmer it's getting packed out i
was<00:04:04.080> actually<00:04:04.260> lucky<00:04:05.040> enough<00:04:05.370> to<00:04:05.490> find<00:04:05.520> a

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
was actually lucky enough to find a

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.520 
was actually lucky enough to find a
world<00:04:06.090> that<00:04:06.330> no<00:04:06.690> one<00:04:06.840> was<00:04:06.960> doing<00:04:06.990> the<00:04:07.260> glimmer

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
world that no one was doing the glimmer

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.100 
world that no one was doing the glimmer
thing<00:04:07.830> but<00:04:08.610> you<00:04:08.850> know<00:04:08.970> it's<00:04:09.210> up<00:04:09.390> you<00:04:09.990> know

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
thing but you know it's up you know

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.590 
thing but you know it's up you know
there's<00:04:10.500> about<00:04:11.280> person<00:04:12.000> there<00:04:12.180> every<00:04:12.420> time

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
there's about person there every time

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.180 
there's about person there every time
you<00:04:12.780> go<00:04:12.870> into<00:04:13.020> the<00:04:13.170> world<00:04:13.380> but<00:04:13.530> i<00:04:13.710> guess<00:04:13.920> i<00:04:14.040> got

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
you go into the world but i guess i got

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.450 
you go into the world but i guess i got
lucky<00:04:14.840> so<00:04:15.840> this<00:04:16.710> is<00:04:16.859> where<00:04:17.010> they<00:04:17.100> usually

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:17.460 
lucky so this is where they usually

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.550 
lucky so this is where they usually
spawn<00:04:17.790> and<00:04:18.120> if<00:04:18.239> you<00:04:18.330> do<00:04:18.540> not<00:04:18.690> kill<00:04:19.109> them<00:04:19.350> they

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
spawn and if you do not kill them they
