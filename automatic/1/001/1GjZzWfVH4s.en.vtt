00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.080 

now<00:04:19.810> this<00:04:20.260> obviously<00:04:20.799> was<00:04:21.130> just<00:04:21.489> with<00:04:21.609> one<00:04:21.820> mic

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
now this obviously was just with one mic

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.300 
now this obviously was just with one mic
and<00:04:22.389> if<00:04:22.510> you<00:04:22.600> add<00:04:22.750> a<00:04:22.780> second<00:04:23.320> mic<00:04:23.500> kind<00:04:24.190> of<00:04:24.250> a

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
and if you add a second mic kind of a

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.610 
and if you add a second mic kind of a
bonus<00:04:24.669> idea<00:04:25.060> is<00:04:25.270> that<00:04:25.690> you<00:04:25.990> have<00:04:26.020> now<00:04:26.560> two

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
bonus idea is that you have now two

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.280 
bonus idea is that you have now two
positions<00:04:27.430> you<00:04:27.580> have<00:04:27.610> two<00:04:28.389> different<00:04:28.630> angles

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
positions you have two different angles

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.939 
positions you have two different angles
of<00:04:29.800> attack<00:04:29.889> on<00:04:30.370> these<00:04:30.610> cymbals<00:04:31.120> so<00:04:31.389> one<00:04:32.080> one

microphone<00:04:33.430> may<00:04:33.760> be<00:04:33.820> getting<00:04:34.180> a<00:04:34.210> little<00:04:34.300> bit

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:34.449 
microphone may be getting a little bit

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:36.990 
microphone may be getting a little bit
more<00:04:34.720> character<00:04:35.169> one<00:04:35.590> symbol<00:04:36.130> and<00:04:36.340> as<00:04:36.760> that

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
more character one symbol and as that

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.540 
more character one symbol and as that
symbol<00:04:37.419> is<00:04:37.540> sway<00:04:37.900> the<00:04:38.680> other<00:04:38.860> mic<00:04:39.130> is<00:04:39.310> getting

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
symbol is sway the other mic is getting

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.010 
symbol is sway the other mic is getting
a<00:04:39.580> slightly<00:04:39.850> different<00:04:40.060> character<00:04:40.870> of<00:04:40.960> that

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
a slightly different character of that

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.370 
a slightly different character of that
symbol<00:04:41.620> at<00:04:41.860> a<00:04:42.400> different<00:04:42.910> time<00:04:43.120> and<00:04:43.479> as<00:04:44.080> the

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
symbol at a different time and as the

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.290 
symbol at a different time and as the
symbol<00:04:44.740> rocks<00:04:45.010> it<00:04:45.340> actually<00:04:45.760> kind<00:04:45.970> of<00:04:46.000> makes<00:04:46.180> a

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
symbol rocks it actually kind of makes a

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.930 
symbol rocks it actually kind of makes a
little<00:04:46.330> bit<00:04:46.570> of<00:04:46.660> a<00:04:46.780> swirling<00:04:47.380> sound<00:04:47.710> now<00:04:48.580> we

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
little bit of a swirling sound now we

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.640 
little bit of a swirling sound now we
had<00:04:49.060> talked<00:04:49.270> in<00:04:49.479> a<00:04:49.660> previous<00:04:49.690> issue<00:04:50.350> about<00:04:50.470> the

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
had talked in a previous issue about the

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.770 
had talked in a previous issue about the
Glyn<00:04:50.860> John's<00:04:50.889> method<00:04:51.610> about<00:04:51.820> how<00:04:52.030> there's

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
Glyn John's method about how there's

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.900 
Glyn John's method about how there's
actually<00:04:53.199> an<00:04:53.289> O<00:04:53.560> at<00:04:53.800> the<00:04:53.919> edge<00:04:54.100> of<00:04:54.280> that<00:04:54.400> symbol

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
actually an O at the edge of that symbol

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.750 
actually an O at the edge of that symbol
and<00:04:55.060> if<00:04:55.840> you<00:04:56.020> go<00:04:56.169> to<00:04:56.229> the<00:04:56.410> extreme<00:04:56.889> where<00:04:57.190> a<00:04:57.430> mic

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
and if you go to the extreme where a mic

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.300 
and if you go to the extreme where a mic
is<00:04:57.940> so<00:04:58.210> far<00:04:58.479> down<00:04:58.510> so<00:04:59.050> far<00:04:59.229> low<00:04:59.530> there's

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
is so far down so far low there's

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.070 
is so far down so far low there's
actually<00:05:00.699> this<00:05:00.910> void<00:05:01.210> of<00:05:01.389> sound<00:05:01.660> and<00:05:01.930> it

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
actually this void of sound and it

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.600 
actually this void of sound and it
creates<00:05:02.410> this<00:05:02.560> cancellation<00:05:03.130> where<00:05:03.520> the

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
creates this cancellation where the

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.820 
creates this cancellation where the
cymbal<00:05:03.940> actually<00:05:04.240> jumps<00:05:04.690> and<00:05:05.260> this<00:05:05.500> is<00:05:05.650> not

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
cymbal actually jumps and this is not

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.430 
cymbal actually jumps and this is not
that<00:05:05.860> this<00:05:06.699> is<00:05:06.850> more<00:05:07.060> a<00:05:07.090> subtle<00:05:07.810> effect<00:05:07.960> if

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
that this is more a subtle effect if

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.010 
that this is more a subtle effect if
you're<00:05:08.770> you<00:05:09.250> know<00:05:09.280> hard<00:05:09.820> panning<00:05:10.300> you<00:05:10.630> know<00:05:10.780> a

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
you're you know hard panning you know a

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.250 
you're you know hard panning you know a
space<00:05:11.590> pair<00:05:11.979> is<00:05:12.160> overheads<00:05:12.699> just<00:05:13.660> by<00:05:14.020> having

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
space pair is overheads just by having

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.320 
space pair is overheads just by having
two<00:05:14.620> different<00:05:14.770> angles<00:05:15.039> attack<00:05:15.550> on<00:05:15.760> cymbals

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
two different angles attack on cymbals

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.779 
two different angles attack on cymbals
there<00:05:17.110> actually<00:05:17.590> is<00:05:17.710> a<00:05:17.740> slight<00:05:18.190> swirling

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:18.789 
there actually is a slight swirling

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:20.250 
there actually is a slight swirling
sound<00:05:19.000> that<00:05:19.150> you<00:05:19.270> get<00:05:19.479> it's<00:05:19.720> actually<00:05:20.020> pretty

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 
sound that you get it's actually pretty

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.290 
sound that you get it's actually pretty
cool<00:05:20.560> I<00:05:20.860> actually<00:05:21.370> find<00:05:21.729> pretty<00:05:21.970> pleasing

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
cool I actually find pretty pleasing

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.600 
cool I actually find pretty pleasing
when<00:05:22.690> it<00:05:22.780> comes<00:05:23.020> to<00:05:23.349> when<00:05:24.010> it<00:05:24.039> comes<00:05:24.280> to<00:05:24.400> mix
