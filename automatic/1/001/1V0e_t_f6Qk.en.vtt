00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.480
 hello and welcome again i am cs and today 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:24.860
 I bring you a trick here on the map 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.690
 transit in the call of duty black ops 2 and 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.880
 good for this trick what are we going to 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.080
 need is going to be just like 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.989
 you are seeing here that I am 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.970
 building the shield and also what 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.580
 we will need it will be justly 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.470
 the turbine that gives us 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.890
 electricity to open our 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:45.080
 dear secret doors worth what 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.540
 what must be done before anything is 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.430
 just place the turbine there because 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.650
 is going to be where we are going to do the 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.120
 trick is how you see right there in 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.729
 that corner of agreement as you have seen 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.129
 there once placed there what 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:01.339
 we need now is the shield so 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.500
 let's go for him okay now I'm lame 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:06.140
 I'm going to put the valet we make a cut 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.900
 here and we take the shield as you see 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.479
 right here I pick it up I'm going 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.700
 new making a cut and we come for 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.640
 here it's worth and now what you have to do is 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.260
 put yourself in this corner and aim little at 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.280
 little let's go forward 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.970
 right there we stop 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.380
 As you can see there is , just put 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.770
 we give the change we give to the 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.049
 square or x in xbox and if we get 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.479
 well, he will put us here in agreement 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.100
 if you do not try to run a little 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.170
 that maybe you get lucky with 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.570
 agreement is a trick that can cost you 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.090
 a little but I already tell you these tricks to 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.450
 final if you insist you end up leaving t 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.360
 especially if you do them well according 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.890
 well one thing about this trick is that the 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.900
 zombies 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.400
 we will not be able to choose the 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.590
 bonuses in agreement since the 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.780
 zombies die just in front of 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.270
 us but this has a good thing 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.820
 because if there is a colleague outside you can 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.979
 collect the bonuses and even 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.200
 we could revive him from here 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.479
 if there is not much zombie, it's worth everything 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.370
 be careful that it depends where you 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.740
 I can place a host 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.570
 The zombies are accurate and if they arrive 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.160
 to hit several hosts without a titan is 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.340
 logical that they will end up killing you 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.620
 good agreement because nothing left you with this 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.870
 great trick I hope you liked it already 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.130
 you know how to give to the one to subscribe ospar 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.130
