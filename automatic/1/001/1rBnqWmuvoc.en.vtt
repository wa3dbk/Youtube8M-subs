00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
unique about it so i'll probably just

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.270

put it in a drawer or pass it along

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.699 
put it in a drawer or pass it along
because<00:03:46.280> i<00:03:47.120> don't<00:03:48.080> know<00:03:48.140> when<00:03:48.290> i'll<00:03:48.380> reach<00:03:48.500> for
