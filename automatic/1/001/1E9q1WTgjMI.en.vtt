the roads for two years the first thing
I'm<00:00:17.460> going<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.760> show<00:00:17.880> you<00:00:18.150> is<00:00:18.570> that<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:19.050> legs

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:19.349 
I'm going to show you is that the legs

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:23.390 
I'm going to show you is that the legs
act<00:00:20.220> as<00:00:20.610> walking<00:00:21.119> poles<00:00:21.740> as<00:00:22.740> if<00:00:23.009> there<00:00:23.250> was

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
act as walking poles as if there was

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.249 
act as walking poles as if there was
sticks<00:00:24.349> your<00:00:25.349> knee<00:00:25.920> is<00:00:26.160> locked<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.989> you<00:00:27.989> just

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
roll forward just as a vaulting pole

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.290 
roll forward just as a vaulting pole
working<00:00:32.310> now<00:00:33.270> if<00:00:33.989> we<00:00:34.890> put<00:00:35.700> one<00:00:35.880> foot<00:00:36.149> in<00:00:36.270> front

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
working now if we put one foot in front

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.770 
working now if we put one foot in front
of<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.780> other<00:00:37.020> like<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.800> then<00:00:38.280> step

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
of the other like that and then step

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.690 
of the other like that and then step
forward<00:00:39.780> like<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.829> can<00:00:41.010> see<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.520> the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
forward like that you can see that the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.169 
forward like that you can see that the
foot<00:00:41.969> stays<00:00:42.300> still<00:00:42.690> but<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:44.429> top<00:00:44.699> part

00:00:45.169 --> 00:00:45.179 
foot stays still but that the top part

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:47.990 
foot stays still but that the top part
of<00:00:45.269> the<00:00:45.420> leg<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:46.199> moving<00:00:46.500> forward<00:00:47.039> just<00:00:47.399> like<00:00:47.640> a

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
running our vaulting process just like

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.869 
running our vaulting process just like
that<00:00:53.609> you've<00:00:54.269> walked<00:00:54.570> from<00:00:55.230> one<00:00:55.440> foot<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.339> the

that you've walked from one foot to the

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.779 
that you've walked from one foot to the
next<00:00:57.179> foot<00:00:57.510> which<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.350> another<00:00:59.010> vaulting<00:00:59.519> Pole

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
going to show you that gravity and

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.720 
going to show you that gravity and
momentum<00:01:06.720> does<00:01:07.710> what<00:01:07.890> get<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.550> move

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:08.730 
momentum does what get you to move

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.470

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
only way you could start if i press with

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.950 
only way you could start if i press with
my<00:01:40.350> toes<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:41.219> put<00:01:41.729> my<00:01:41.909> foot<00:01:42.180> one<00:01:42.570> foot<00:01:42.600> in
