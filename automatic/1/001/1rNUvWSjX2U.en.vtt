I know you can't even see the lashes but

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.619 
I know you can't even see the lashes but
these<00:00:59.969> start<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.449> here<00:01:01.489> in<00:01:02.489> my<00:01:02.699> eye<00:01:02.730> they're

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
these start it here in my eye they're

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.810 
these start it here in my eye they're
fairly<00:01:03.960> long<00:01:04.939> well<00:01:06.740> the<00:01:07.740> only<00:01:07.950> reason<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.549> like

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
fairly long well the only reason I like

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.390 
fairly long well the only reason I like
to<00:01:09.000> use<00:01:09.210> these<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.689> because<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.740> gives<00:01:11.010> me<00:01:11.130> more

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
to use these is because it gives me more

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.030 
to use these is because it gives me more
length<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.850> my<00:01:12.119> eyes<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.810> doesn't<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.770> see<00:01:13.950> how

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
length to my eyes it doesn't you see how

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.320 
length to my eyes it doesn't you see how
it<00:01:14.159> doesn't<00:01:14.310> weight<00:01:14.640> them<00:01:14.760> down<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.180> doesn't

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
it doesn't weight them down and doesn't

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.960 
it doesn't weight them down and doesn't
look<00:01:15.509> like<00:01:15.659> I'm<00:01:15.780> wearing<00:01:15.900> so<00:01:16.290> many<00:01:16.520> lashes<00:01:17.520> so

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
look like I'm wearing so many lashes so

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.950 
look like I'm wearing so many lashes so
I<00:01:18.710> wanted<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.830> say<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.820> quick<00:01:21.420> tip<00:01:21.720> when

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
I wanted to say that a quick tip when

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.570 
I wanted to say that a quick tip when
you're<00:01:22.049> putting<00:01:22.380> on<00:01:22.530> your<00:01:22.650> lashes<00:01:23.220> if<00:01:23.430> they

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
you're putting on your lashes if they

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.460 
you're putting on your lashes if they
feel<00:01:23.820> uncomfortable<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.869> didn't<00:01:25.200> put<00:01:25.350> them

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
feel uncomfortable you didn't put them

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.020 
feel uncomfortable you didn't put them
on<00:01:25.590> right<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:25.979> know<00:01:26.100> that's<00:01:26.460> like<00:01:26.580> an<00:01:26.820> obvious

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
on right I know that's like an obvious

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.030 
on right I know that's like an obvious
sign<00:01:27.479> but<00:01:28.080> sometimes<00:01:28.500> they<00:01:28.650> feel<00:01:28.860> comfortable

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
sign but sometimes they feel comfortable

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.980 
sign but sometimes they feel comfortable
with<00:01:29.369> your<00:01:29.610> eyes<00:01:29.790> open<00:01:30.150> but<00:01:30.360> when<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.720> close

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
with your eyes open but when you close

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.200 
with your eyes open but when you close
them<00:01:31.200> they<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:32.220> feel<00:01:32.490> them<00:01:32.610> they're<00:01:32.759> you're

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
them they you feel them they're you're

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.969 
them they you feel them they're you're
not<00:01:33.360> supposed<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.840> feel<00:01:34.079> your<00:01:34.229> lashes<00:01:34.619> at<00:01:34.829> all

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
not supposed to feel your lashes at all

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.910 
not supposed to feel your lashes at all
so<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.700> good<00:01:36.420> tip<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:36.869> when<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.560> put<00:01:37.829> them

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
so a good tip is that when you put them

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.190 
so a good tip is that when you put them
on<00:01:38.070> point<00:01:38.850> your<00:01:39.030> eyes<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.600> if<00:01:39.659> they<00:01:39.780> still

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
on point your eyes and if they still

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.020 
on point your eyes and if they still
feel<00:01:40.439> really<00:01:40.650> uncomfortable<00:01:40.950> like<00:01:41.549> take<00:01:41.850> them

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
feel really uncomfortable like take them

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.550 
feel really uncomfortable like take them
off<00:01:42.180> because<00:01:42.360> it's<00:01:42.600> not<00:01:42.780> worth<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.409> be

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
off because it's not worth it to be

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.499 
off because it's not worth it to be
uncomfortable<00:01:43.799> all<00:01:44.250> night<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:45.329> know<00:01:45.420> you

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
uncomfortable all night you know you

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.940 
uncomfortable all night you know you
want<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.810> have<00:01:45.899> your<00:01:46.079> lashes<00:01:46.500> feel<00:01:46.770> like
