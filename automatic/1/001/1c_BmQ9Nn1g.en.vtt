it looks like loose powder you can see

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.100 
it looks like loose powder you can see
right<00:02:59.810> here<00:03:00.519> but<00:03:01.519> when<00:03:01.940> you<00:03:02.060> put<00:03:02.299> it<00:03:02.420> on<00:03:02.630> it

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
right here but when you put it on it

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.009 
right here but when you put it on it
feels<00:03:03.950> like<00:03:04.160> a<00:03:04.220> liquid<00:03:04.579> now<00:03:05.329> it<00:03:05.540> says<00:03:05.750> that

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019

it's made with coconut water and I think

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.039

the<00:03:10.190> coconut<00:03:10.730> water<00:03:10.970> has<00:03:11.269> something<00:03:11.690> to<00:03:11.840> do

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
the coconut water has something to do

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.710 
the coconut water has something to do
with<00:03:12.349> how<00:03:12.860> it<00:03:13.160> feels<00:03:13.579> because<00:03:14.269> when<00:03:14.420> you<00:03:14.510> put

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
with how it feels because when you put

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.809 
with how it feels because when you put
it<00:03:14.810> on<00:03:14.900> it<00:03:15.200> gives<00:03:15.500> you<00:03:15.650> like<00:03:15.829> this<00:03:15.980> cool<00:03:16.370> water
