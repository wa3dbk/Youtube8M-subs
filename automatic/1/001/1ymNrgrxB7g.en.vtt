00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.830
 hello good today we are here to 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:12.160
 explain how to create a user in 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:15.370
 windows server 2012 we will start playing 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.020
 the start key of the keyboard in the 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.270
 simplest and fastest way to 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.420
 get to the start menu of the world 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.670
 notice how we can see here there are many 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.109
 types of icons we have to go to the icon 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.010
 of the poles of users and teams 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:31.950
 gasteiz directory and click there 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.030
 now a new window will open 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.650
 that depending on the speed of our 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.220
 computer will take longer or it will take less 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:42.489
 load colombo as we can see already 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.110
 we have here the folder agreed by 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.270
 example, we will do it where 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:51.610
 puts user that is the group three vouchers 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:53.080
 we click on the folder of them is and you see 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.790
 Here you will see a lot of 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.260
 administrators et cetera etcetera but 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.540
 that folder we are not going to use it from 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.190
 moment we go to users we click 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.700
 with the right mouse button 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:07.300
 this little screen appears 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:10.600
 we go to new and here they appear 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.540
 different options and we go to the new 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.400
 user 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.380
 the agreed upon we are told this little screen 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.940
 in the name of a battery is obligatory and the 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.790
 Home User login name 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.410
 the first name is also obligatory 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.570
 you can put the name that more you 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.550
 fancy you and in the name of 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.040
 user login equally 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.230
 what you prefer us 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.240
 example let's put the name of the 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:37.840
 two components of the group that are in 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:41.609
 these moments by my side for example 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.609
 esteban and Ã¡lvaro 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.409
 the domain name we are going to put my 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:52.310
 name for example more 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:54.679
 Manuel agreed once having these 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.390
 data do not forget us because they are 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:58.159
 mandatory to be able to start later 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.659
 the session with our users about 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.670
 all the most important is the name of 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:05.670
 initiation of users remember you well 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:08.399
 that name and we give to next 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.080
 okay now here he asks us for a 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.720
 password this password has to be 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.380
 alphanumeric has to contain numbers 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.970
 letters and signs for example the one 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:25.260
 we usually use here in class 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:31.140
 is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 pointed 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:35.579
 and we repeat them 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 to points 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.439
 okay and now here we have several 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:40.750
 options agreement and will give the 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:43.770
 option that the password never expires 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.770
 and click there 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.340
 okay now we give it to next 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:52.700
 Here we see the data we have 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:56.540
 introduced is valid and we give it to finalize 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.720
 and how can we see our user already 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.720
