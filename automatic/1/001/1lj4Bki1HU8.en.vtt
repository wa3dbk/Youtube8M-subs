saving<00:01:12.840> battery<00:01:13.229> quick<00:01:14.070> capture<00:01:14.280> has<00:01:14.520> another

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
saving battery quick capture has another

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.940 
saving battery quick capture has another
advantage<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.380> because<00:01:16.799> your

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
advantage and that is because your

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.760 
advantage and that is because your
camera<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.610> cooler<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.900> also<00:01:19.110> means<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.530> your

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
camera is cooler it also means that your

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.120 
camera is cooler it also means that your
camera<00:01:20.009> fogs<00:01:20.430> less<00:01:20.729> easily<00:01:21.259> even<00:01:22.259> if<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.680> use
