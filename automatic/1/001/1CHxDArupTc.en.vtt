00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
reason this has gone come under a lot of

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.620 
reason this has gone come under a lot of
controversy<00:02:03.610> from<00:02:04.650> players<00:02:05.650> from<00:02:06.630> just

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
controversy from players from just

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.509 
controversy from players from just
everybody<00:02:08.259> in<00:02:08.379> the<00:02:08.440> community<00:02:08.530> because<00:02:09.039> they

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
everybody in the community because they

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.480 
everybody in the community because they
don't<00:02:09.700> like<00:02:09.849> the<00:02:09.970> price<00:02:10.149> of<00:02:10.479> $15<00:02:11.260> and<00:02:11.500> really

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
don't like the price of $15 and really

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.309 
don't like the price of $15 and really
what<00:02:12.700> I<00:02:12.730> don't<00:02:12.940> understand<00:02:13.569> is<00:02:13.720> why<00:02:13.780> they

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
what I don't understand is why they

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.430 
what I don't understand is why they
don't<00:02:14.530> like<00:02:14.770> that<00:02:15.010> price<00:02:15.569> now<00:02:16.569> I

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
don't like that price now I

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.980 
don't like that price now I
can<00:02:17.530> see<00:02:17.740> why<00:02:18.010> because<00:02:18.550> $15<00:02:19.210> is<00:02:19.450> a<00:02:19.480> lot<00:02:19.840> of

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
can see why because $15 is a lot of

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.480 
can see why because $15 is a lot of
money<00:02:20.020> for<00:02:20.260> some<00:02:20.560> people<00:02:20.890> who<00:02:21.040> let's<00:02:21.280> say<00:02:21.400> our

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
money for some people who let's say our

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.730 
money for some people who let's say our
13<00:02:22.030> years<00:02:22.210> old<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:22.570> blue<00:02:22.750> don't<00:02:22.900> have<00:02:22.990> jobs<00:02:23.350> or

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
13 years old and blue don't have jobs or

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.250 
13 years old and blue don't have jobs or
they<00:02:24.490> aren't<00:02:24.880> exactly<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.510> most<00:02:25.630> wealthy

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
they aren't exactly the most wealthy

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.670 
they aren't exactly the most wealthy
people<00:02:26.760> so<00:02:27.870> that's<00:02:28.870> probably<00:02:29.260> one<00:02:29.500> of<00:02:29.530> the

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
people so that's probably one of the

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.380 
people so that's probably one of the
reasons<00:02:29.710> that<00:02:30.190> they<00:02:30.640> don't<00:02:30.820> like<00:02:30.880> the<00:02:31.060> fifteen

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
reasons that they don't like the fifteen

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.580 
reasons that they don't like the fifteen
dollars<00:02:31.750> and<00:02:31.900> if<00:02:31.960> I'm<00:02:32.050> insulting<00:02:32.410> anybody
