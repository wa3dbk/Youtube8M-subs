00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
the tutorial help text but like I said

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.390 
the tutorial help text but like I said
you<00:04:23.760> have<00:04:23.880> to<00:04:24.030> have<00:04:24.180> the<00:04:24.390> data<00:04:24.570> bins<00:04:24.900> in<00:04:25.230> of<00:04:26.160> an

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
you have to have the data bins in of an

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.700 
you have to have the data bins in of an
account<00:04:26.760> that's<00:04:27.180> already<00:04:27.870> beating<00:04:28.320> it<00:04:28.500> and

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
account that's already beating it and

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.910 
account that's already beating it and
then<00:04:29.670> delete<00:04:29.820> the<00:04:30.090> dative<00:04:30.420> in<00:04:30.510> 48<00:04:31.020> only<00:04:31.350> and

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
then delete the dative in 48 only and

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.980 
then delete the dative in 48 only and
then<00:04:32.730> this<00:04:32.850> is<00:04:32.910> the<00:04:33.060> part<00:04:33.360> where<00:04:33.750> you<00:04:33.840> got<00:04:33.960> to

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
then this is the part where you got to

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.680 
then this is the part where you got to
do<00:04:34.170> it<00:04:34.350> you<00:04:34.560> click<00:04:34.770> a<00:04:34.800> starter<00:04:35.250> dragon<00:04:35.690> anyone

the multi-tasking takes a little longer
to<00:04:48.540> close<00:04:48.750> but<00:04:49.080> it<00:04:49.170> still<00:04:49.380> works<00:04:50.660> so<00:04:51.660> then<00:04:51.980> when

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
to close but it still works so then when

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.950
