00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.819
 grapes to all boys and girls how about you 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:08.029
 I'm going to teach a little trick to enter 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:10.010
 basically in that kind of tower in 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:13.520
 concrete let's enter 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.990
 and right in that little area it's worth 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.090
 At this moment, all you have to do is 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.900
 enter patrol of - and go to the 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.900
 area on the left 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:36.430
 It's worth it once you get to this area 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.200
 just keep pulling what's coming 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.300
 being would be almost like circling the map 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.300
 go through this area and go straight 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.750
 ok guys, go straight through this area 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.000
 once I got to this area friend that 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.369
 you would have to do would be to arrive at a 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.680
 area there is generally in 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.509
 in here, it's worth, guys, the only thing 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.790
 had and was pursuing to continue advancing 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.850
 forward 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.070
 and I recommend that you bring a 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.220
 sorcerer because the planning would be more 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.850
 easy to climb so you have to 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:33.270
 climb and if not the titan the hunter 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.950
 You can also do it but I tell you 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.290
 that you are going to have a very difficult time with 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.930
 hunter you have to do would be in this 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.460
 area we have to clean up enemies to 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.650
 basically while you are trying 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.080
 go up that does not bother us 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.910
 basically it's worth guys once you have 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.500
 cleaned of enemies the next thing that 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.850
 you will have to do it does not have to 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.060
 users of this rock I already tell you 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.950
 you have to climb that one, not those not to that 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.810
 then you would have to go up there once 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.880
 you get there you go up on the rod 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.619
 above and the next thing would be to go up there and 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.990
 then up there after up 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.250
 you have to jump to the cylinder this 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.750
 you see this thing has a kind of 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.190
 barrier is really a 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.520
 teleporter that goes upwards 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:15.090
 as you see and let us pass as you see 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.280
 bounce jce then to climb you go 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.900
 teach how you have to do it I already 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.600
 I'm saying that he's going to leave us 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.710
 first nor chiripa this is very chungo 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.680
 it's a trick the truth 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:29.700
 complicated as you can see I just 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.700
 climb to that and I've fallen 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.659
 It's okay guys, you see, I'm here 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.599
 arriving in this area and once you see 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:15.159
 here as you can see, you will notice 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.100
 upwards upwards or towards 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:18.750
 up above watering 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.180
 and when you get to the top 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.610
 turn 'aces' and bony poke inside 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.770
 an area that goes from a dlc a mission or 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.350
 something probably do not think this is 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:31.260
 the root neither of cunt as you see I'm already 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.510
 up here and nothing basically there's no 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.240
 absolutely nothing will not hold to look 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.800
 that is very strange and nothing the following 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.710
 I would be going to tell you where there are three 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.240
 Specters here in this area here 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.740
 there would be some here up here and here 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.080
 in this little corner there would be some arrivals 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.940
 has caught and the truth do not worry 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.170
 for picking them up because they're going to ban us 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.090
 nothing 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.870
 let's the chosen ones do not go banned I know 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.870
 do not worry 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.180
 the next spectrum would be inside the 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.980
 next aspect would be on top of this 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.350
 thing as you see coming from there 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.900
 in this rock I would think that here or in 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.400
 an area of these and the last spectrum 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.870
 I would be there 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.870
 as you see we are going to go for it 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.849
 As you can see, guys would be up there 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.780
 what we have to do is go up a bit 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:32.700
 little from platform to platform you see 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.360
 here 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.500
 and here I would have is the next spectrum 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.790
 well, well, guys, I hope you guys 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.200
 liked the favorite light video 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.580
 subscribe you onu you are not and see you in 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.240
