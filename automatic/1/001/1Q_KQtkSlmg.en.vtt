what<00:03:48.780> a<00:03:48.810> little<00:03:49.680> bit<00:03:49.799> of<00:03:49.860> a<00:03:49.950> look<00:03:50.129> at<00:03:50.340> how

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
what a little bit of a look at how

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.309 
what a little bit of a look at how
different<00:03:51.000> external<00:03:51.569> views<00:03:51.930> give<00:03:52.200> them

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
different external views give them

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.100 
different external views give them
different<00:03:52.560> use<00:03:53.220> up<00:03:53.549> the<00:03:53.819> aircraft<00:03:54.330> while<00:03:54.900> you

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
different use up the aircraft while you

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.530 
different use up the aircraft while you
are<00:03:55.230> flying<00:03:55.500> you<00:03:56.159> do<00:03:56.340> not<00:03:56.519> see<00:03:56.940> these<00:03:57.180> views

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
are flying you do not see these views

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.920 
are flying you do not see these views
usually<00:03:58.230> in<00:03:58.379> other<00:03:58.620> freeware<00:03:59.190> aircraft<00:04:00.060> in<00:04:00.690> a

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
usually in other freeware aircraft in a

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.899 
usually in other freeware aircraft in a
few<00:04:01.140> but<00:04:01.319> not<00:04:01.500> very<00:04:01.769> many<00:04:02.010> I'd<00:04:02.340> also<00:04:02.519> like<00:04:02.730> you

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:02.909 
few but not very many I'd also like you

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.839 
few but not very many I'd also like you
notice<00:04:03.090> that<00:04:03.269> the<00:04:03.739> sunlight<00:04:04.739> does<00:04:05.250> affect<00:04:05.700> the

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
notice that the sunlight does affect the

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:07.640 
notice that the sunlight does affect the
textures<00:04:06.390> very<00:04:06.659> well<00:04:06.870> it<00:04:07.019> kind<00:04:07.230> of<00:04:07.319> makes<00:04:07.530> it

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
textures very well it kind of makes it

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.210 
textures very well it kind of makes it
glow<00:04:08.450> shadows<00:04:09.560> those<00:04:10.560> are<00:04:10.709> very<00:04:10.829> nice<00:04:11.159> and

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
glow shadows those are very nice and

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.979 
glow shadows those are very nice and
makes<00:04:11.610> it<00:04:11.730> a<00:04:11.760> little<00:04:11.879> bit<00:04:12.030> more<00:04:12.180> realistic<00:04:12.540> a

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
makes it a little bit more realistic a

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.199 
makes it a little bit more realistic a
lot<00:04:13.709> of<00:04:13.890> work<00:04:14.099> probably<00:04:14.489> went<00:04:14.909> into<00:04:15.060> this

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
lot of work probably went into this

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.449 
lot of work probably went into this
aircraft<00:04:15.750> just<00:04:16.019> and<00:04:16.320> do<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:16.709> little<00:04:16.919> thing<00:04:17.190> I

land<00:05:27.000> here<00:05:27.530> landing<00:05:28.530> this<00:05:28.680> aircraft<00:05:28.920> is

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
land here landing this aircraft is

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.160 
land here landing this aircraft is
actually<00:05:30.600> pretty<00:05:31.110> easy<00:05:31.280> for<00:05:32.280> a<00:05:32.340> tail<00:05:33.170> tail

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.170 
actually pretty easy for a tail tail

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.740 
actually pretty easy for a tail tail
dragger<00:05:34.620> I<00:05:34.650> think<00:05:34.950> they're<00:05:35.070> called<00:05:35.600> does<00:05:36.600> it

dragger I think they're called does it
bounce<00:05:36.930> that<00:05:37.230> much<00:05:37.470> you<00:05:37.830> just<00:05:37.860> have<00:05:38.190> to<00:05:38.520> land

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
bounce that much you just have to land

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.510 
bounce that much you just have to land
it<00:05:39.330> slowly<00:05:40.020> don't<00:05:40.650> try<00:05:40.920> and<00:05:40.950> force<00:05:41.310> it<00:05:41.460> down

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
it slowly don't try and force it down

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
much to me you just have to take it in a

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.700 
much to me you just have to take it in a
little<00:06:02.520> bit<00:06:02.850> slower<00:06:03.120> watch<00:06:04.050> your<00:06:04.260> throttle

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
little bit slower watch your throttle
