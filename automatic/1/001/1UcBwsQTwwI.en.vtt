00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
the very first thing that you do know

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.720 
the very first thing that you do know
before<00:00:07.230> you<00:00:07.350> start<00:00:07.620> in<00:00:07.710> your<00:00:07.740> game<00:00:08.010> and<00:00:08.040> before

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
before you start in your game and before

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.640 
before you start in your game and before
you<00:00:08.849> turn<00:00:09.059> off<00:00:09.210> subtitles<00:00:09.420> and<00:00:10.050> before<00:00:10.469> you

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
you turn off subtitles and before you

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.249 
you turn off subtitles and before you
invert<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.190> x-axis<00:00:11.790> on<00:00:11.940> your<00:00:12.090> mouse<00:00:12.269> no<00:00:12.960> wait

sweet<00:00:48.210> sexy<00:00:48.510> graphics<00:00:55.820> ok<00:00:56.820> let's<00:00:57.180> start<00:00:57.390> with

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
sweet sexy graphics ok let's start with

sweet sexy graphics ok let's start with
the<00:00:57.719> easy<00:00:57.870> one<00:00:58.190> resolution<00:00:59.190> this<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.879> simply<00:01:00.239> a

the easy one resolution this is simply a

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.670 
the easy one resolution this is simply a
measure<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.930> number<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.440> horizontal

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
measure of the number of horizontal

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.130 
measure of the number of horizontal

console<00:01:07.170> gaming<00:01:07.380> there<00:01:07.710> are<00:01:07.770> typically<00:01:08.100> a

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
console gaming there are typically a

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.190 
console gaming there are typically a

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
PC at a load of weird and wonderful

PC at a load of weird and wonderful
aspect<00:01:12.780> ratios<00:01:13.369> so<00:01:14.369> why<00:01:14.610> does<00:01:14.790> resolution

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
aspect ratios so why does resolution

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.999 
aspect ratios so why does resolution
matter<00:01:15.570> well<00:01:16.080> ultimately<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.799> higher

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
matter well ultimately the higher

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.620 
matter well ultimately the higher
resolution<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.670> display<00:01:18.119> at<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.479> more

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
resolution you display at the more

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.630 
resolution you display at the more
detail<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.020> get<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.650> therefore<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.400> better

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
detail you get and therefore the better

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.149 
detail you get and therefore the better
the<00:01:20.880> image<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.810> also<00:01:21.990> helps<00:01:22.439> prevent<00:01:22.560> unwanted

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
the image it also helps prevent unwanted

graphical oddities like aliasing and
speaking<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.490> which<00:01:29.180> have<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.210> ever<00:01:30.360> looked

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
speaking of which have you ever looked

speaking of which have you ever looked
really<00:01:30.840> closely<00:01:31.079> while<00:01:31.350> playing<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.740> game<00:01:31.950> and

really closely while playing a game and

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.039 
really closely while playing a game and
noticed<00:01:32.790> some<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.270> edges<00:01:33.570> can<00:01:33.750> appear

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
noticed some of the edges can appear

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.710 
noticed some of the edges can appear
Jaggi<00:01:34.470> well<00:01:35.189> this<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.610> because<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:36.060> aliasing

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
Jaggi well this is because of aliasing

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.359 
Jaggi well this is because of aliasing
and<00:01:36.930> it's<00:01:37.079> an<00:01:37.290> artifact<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:37.920> displaying

diagonal things go a bit weird and bumpy

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.100 
diagonal things go a bit weird and bumpy
ok<00:01:50.369> let's<00:01:50.670> use<00:01:50.880> Photoshop<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.600> demonstrate

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
ok let's use Photoshop to demonstrate

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.260 
ok let's use Photoshop to demonstrate
this<00:01:52.259> here<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.070> straight<00:01:53.430> line<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.850> pixels

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
this here is a straight line of pixels

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.380 
this here is a straight line of pixels
all<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:54.930> good<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.290> nice<00:01:55.590> crisp<00:01:56.100> edge<00:01:56.310> however<00:01:57.119> if

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
all is good a nice crisp edge however if

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.359 
all is good a nice crisp edge however if
I<00:01:57.479> try<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.780> draw<00:01:58.110> something<00:01:58.380> at<00:01:58.799> an<00:01:58.890> angle<00:01:59.219> now

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
I try to draw something at an angle now

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.209 
I try to draw something at an angle now
suddenly<00:02:00.299> things<00:02:00.960> get<00:02:01.259> old<00:02:01.530> Jaggi

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
suddenly things get old Jaggi

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.730 
suddenly things get old Jaggi
now<00:02:02.880> what<00:02:03.030> anti-aliasing<00:02:03.960> does<00:02:04.229> is<00:02:04.500> try<00:02:04.710> to

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
now what anti-aliasing does is try to

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.410 
now what anti-aliasing does is try to
get<00:02:04.920> rid<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.310> those<00:02:05.430> jagged<00:02:05.759> edges<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.240> make

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
get rid of those jagged edges and make

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.559 
get rid of those jagged edges and make
everything<00:02:06.750> look<00:02:07.020> silky<00:02:07.500> smooth<00:02:07.740> by

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
everything look silky smooth by

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.569 
everything look silky smooth by
changing<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:08.959> color<00:02:09.200> of<00:02:09.379> pixels<00:02:09.859> around<00:02:10.369> the

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:10.579 
changing the color of pixels around the

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:12.879 
changing the color of pixels around the
edge<00:02:10.729> so<00:02:11.390> that<00:02:11.540> there's<00:02:11.719> a<00:02:11.780> gradual<00:02:12.260> blend<00:02:12.650> of

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:12.889 
edge so that there's a gradual blend of

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:15.220 
edge so that there's a gradual blend of
color<00:02:13.280> interestingly<00:02:14.120> you<00:02:14.510> can<00:02:14.540> turn<00:02:14.900> this<00:02:15.019> on

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
color interestingly you can turn this on

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.179 
color interestingly you can turn this on
as<00:02:15.590> an<00:02:15.739> effect<00:02:16.040> in<00:02:16.189> Photoshop<00:02:16.489> check<00:02:17.450> it<00:02:17.540> out

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:18.189 
as an effect in Photoshop check it out

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:20.649 
as an effect in Photoshop check it out
now<00:02:19.189> if<00:02:19.370> we<00:02:19.519> zoom<00:02:19.549> out<00:02:19.909> a<00:02:19.969> little<00:02:20.030> much

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:20.659 
now if we zoom out a little much

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:26.649 
now if we zoom out a little much
smoother<00:02:24.519> while<00:02:25.519> anti-aliasing<00:02:26.329> can<00:02:26.510> have<00:02:26.629> a

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:26.659 
smoother while anti-aliasing can have a

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:28.839

the<00:03:01.849> reason<00:03:02.180> is<00:03:02.329> that<00:03:02.480> it<00:03:02.569> doesn't<00:03:02.810> use<00:03:02.959> high

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
the reason is that it doesn't use high

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.439 
the reason is that it doesn't use high
resolution<00:03:03.349> frame<00:03:04.159> data<00:03:04.400> instead<00:03:05.209> it's

resolution frame data instead it's

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:07.420

really<00:03:51.680> notice<00:03:51.919> those<00:03:52.159> jaggies<00:03:52.489> at<00:03:52.729> all<00:03:52.879> now

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:53.419 
really notice those jaggies at all now

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:54.339

they<00:03:53.540> are<00:03:53.599> still<00:03:53.870> there

if<00:03:54.409> we<00:03:54.560> zoom<00:03:54.590> right<00:03:54.919> in<00:03:55.099> you<00:03:55.280> can<00:03:55.310> see<00:03:55.729> but<00:03:56.209> the

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
if we zoom right in you can see but the

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:58.390 
if we zoom right in you can see but the
resolution<00:03:56.540> is<00:03:56.840> so<00:03:56.870> great<00:03:57.500> the<00:03:57.799> size<00:03:58.099> of<00:03:58.280> each

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:03.069 
pixel relative to the whole shape is
much<00:04:00.979> smaller<00:04:01.459> and<00:04:01.790> so<00:04:02.150> that<00:04:02.299> stare<00:04:02.599> effect<00:04:02.930> is

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
much smaller and so that stare effect is

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:06.159 
much smaller and so that stare effect is
really<00:04:03.469> reduced<00:04:03.979> the<00:04:04.609> fact<00:04:04.909> that<00:04:05.000> 4k<00:04:05.509> aliasing

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:06.169 
really reduced the fact that 4k aliasing

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:07.569 
really reduced the fact that 4k aliasing
pretty<00:04:06.620> much<00:04:06.799> stops<00:04:07.159> being<00:04:07.370> an<00:04:07.489> issue
