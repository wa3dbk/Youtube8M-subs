00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
hey everybody it is Aaron here today we

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.950 
hey everybody it is Aaron here today we
got<00:00:10.200> something<00:00:10.500> pretty<00:00:10.560> cool

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:11.960 
got something pretty cool

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.560 
got something pretty cool
this<00:00:12.260> one's<00:00:12.470> an<00:00:12.590> LED<00:00:13.330> Optima<00:00:14.440> ml<00:00:15.440> 500<00:00:16.300> so<00:00:17.300> that

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
this one's an LED Optima ml 500 so that

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:24.359 
this one's an LED Optima ml 500 so that
as<00:00:17.810> 500<00:00:18.500> lumens<00:00:18.620> this<00:00:19.250> is<00:00:19.460> an<00:00:19.610> Acer<00:00:22.150> x12<00:00:23.150> 6<00:00:23.750> one

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:24.369 
as 500 lumens this is an Acer x12 6 one

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.810 
as 500 lumens this is an Acer x12 6 one
projector<00:00:25.369> which<00:00:25.580> is<00:00:25.760> running<00:00:26.029> on<00:00:26.390> a<00:00:27.010> lamp<00:00:28.010> all

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
projector which is running on a lamp all

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.710 
projector which is running on a lamp all
right<00:00:29.000> so<00:00:29.150> this<00:00:29.210> is<00:00:29.440> 2,600<00:00:30.440> lumens<00:00:30.800> so<00:00:30.860> we<00:00:31.070> have

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
right so this is 2,600 lumens so we have

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.270 
right so this is 2,600 lumens so we have
DLP<00:00:32.720> DLP<00:00:33.230> both<00:00:33.590> TLPs

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
DLP DLP both TLPs

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.330 
DLP DLP both TLPs
this<00:00:35.030> is<00:00:35.210> what<00:00:35.360> they're<00:00:35.510> throwing<00:00:36.340> okay

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
this is what they're throwing okay

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.799 
this is what they're throwing okay
obviously<00:00:37.760> you<00:00:37.820> can<00:00:37.940> see<00:00:37.970> off<00:00:38.150> to<00:00:38.270> the<00:00:38.360> right

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
obviously you can see off to the right

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.160 
obviously you can see off to the right
at<00:00:39.140> 2,600<00:00:39.710> lumens<00:00:40.330> you<00:00:41.330> are<00:00:41.540> a<00:00:41.570> little<00:00:42.050> bit

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
at 2,600 lumens you are a little bit

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.920 
at 2,600 lumens you are a little bit
brighter<00:00:42.820> actually<00:00:43.820> shows<00:00:44.060> up<00:00:44.300> on<00:00:44.480> the<00:00:44.600> camera

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
brighter actually shows up on the camera

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.810 
brighter actually shows up on the camera
that<00:00:45.050> they're<00:00:45.200> pretty<00:00:45.410> much<00:00:45.530> the<00:00:45.710> same<00:00:45.950> but

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
that they're pretty much the same but

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.760 
that they're pretty much the same but
that<00:00:47.120> one<00:00:47.360> is<00:00:47.450> definitely<00:00:48.050> a<00:00:48.440> little<00:00:48.560> bit

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
that one is definitely a little bit

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.819 
that one is definitely a little bit
brighter<00:00:48.980> so<00:00:49.220> the<00:00:50.180> difference<00:00:50.750> there<00:00:51.620> at<00:00:51.710> the

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
brighter so the difference there at the

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.810 
brighter so the difference there at the
same<00:00:52.010> distances<00:00:52.640> and<00:00:54.070> obviously<00:00:55.070> the<00:00:55.309> LED<00:00:55.700> is

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
same distances and obviously the LED is

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.590 
same distances and obviously the LED is
throwing<00:00:56.210> a<00:00:56.270> much<00:00:56.540> larger<00:00:57.530> screen<00:00:58.370> so<00:00:59.270> that's

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
throwing a much larger screen so that's

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.380 
throwing a much larger screen so that's
interesting<00:01:00.309> it<00:01:01.309> seems<00:01:01.520> as<00:01:01.670> though<00:01:01.790> the<00:01:01.940> LED<00:01:02.360> I

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
interesting it seems as though the LED I

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.060 
interesting it seems as though the LED I
cannot<00:01:02.960> get<00:01:03.500> it<00:01:04.180> to<00:01:05.180> be<00:01:05.479> exactly<00:01:06.320> focused

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
cannot get it to be exactly focused

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.760 
cannot get it to be exactly focused
which<00:01:07.610> kind<00:01:07.880> of<00:01:07.910> irritates<00:01:08.300> me<00:01:08.509> because<00:01:09.050> we

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
which kind of irritates me because we

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.840 
which kind of irritates me because we
are<00:01:09.800> so<00:01:10.190> close<00:01:10.399> with<00:01:10.820> the<00:01:11.060> Acer<00:01:12.520> looks<00:01:13.520> pretty

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
are so close with the Acer looks pretty

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.580 
are so close with the Acer looks pretty
much<00:01:14.000> perfectly<00:01:14.570> in<00:01:14.930> focus<00:01:16.960> yeah<00:01:17.960> both

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
much perfectly in focus yeah both

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.460 
much perfectly in focus yeah both
projectors<00:01:18.940> will<00:01:19.940> turn<00:01:20.659> out<00:01:20.840> of<00:01:20.869> focus<00:01:21.140> in

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
projectors will turn out of focus in

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.020 
projectors will turn out of focus in
five<00:01:21.860> or<00:01:22.040> seven<00:01:22.280> minutes<00:01:22.310> because<00:01:22.790> of<00:01:22.909> the

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
five or seven minutes because of the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.180 
five or seven minutes because of the
heat<00:01:23.270> bends<00:01:23.570> the<00:01:23.810> lenses<00:01:24.200> just<00:01:24.710> the<00:01:24.890> way<00:01:24.979> they

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
heat bends the lenses just the way they

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.340 
heat bends the lenses just the way they
are<00:01:25.220> so<00:01:26.000> I'm<00:01:26.060> going<00:01:26.270> to<00:01:26.390> run<00:01:26.600> a<00:01:26.630> video<00:01:26.990> and

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
are so I'm going to run a video and

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.710 
are so I'm going to run a video and
you're<00:01:28.100> going<00:01:28.220> to<00:01:28.250> see<00:01:28.520> the<00:01:28.909> difference<00:01:29.299> is<00:01:29.479> in

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
you're going to see the difference is in

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.510 
you're going to see the difference is in
quality<00:01:32.950> alright<00:01:33.950> so<00:01:34.040> let's<00:01:34.189> just<00:01:34.250> play<00:01:34.460> a

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
quality alright so let's just play a

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.660 
quality alright so let's just play a
video<00:01:35.350> this<00:01:36.350> is<00:01:36.680> video<00:01:37.100> for<00:01:37.250> my<00:01:37.340> channel<00:01:37.580> if

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
video this is video for my channel if

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.810 
video this is video for my channel if
you<00:01:37.700> want<00:01:37.850> to<00:01:37.880> see<00:01:38.000> you<00:01:38.060> head<00:01:38.180> on<00:01:38.210> over<00:01:38.360> to<00:01:38.570> that

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
you want to see you head on over to that

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.710 
you want to see you head on over to that
so<00:01:40.990> that's<00:01:41.990> my<00:01:42.170> big<00:01:42.350> bolt<00:01:42.560> head<00:01:43.330> the<00:01:44.330> colors

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
so that's my big bolt head the colors

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.999 
so that's my big bolt head the colors
off<00:01:44.990> to<00:01:45.229> the<00:01:45.320> left<00:01:45.650> I<00:01:46.450> actually<00:01:47.450> like<00:01:48.380> more

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
off to the left I actually like more

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.539 
off to the left I actually like more
than<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:49.159> colors<00:01:49.460> off<00:01:49.610> to<00:01:49.729> the<00:01:49.850> right<00:01:51.490> okay<00:01:52.490> so

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
than the colors off to the right okay so

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.850 
than the colors off to the right okay so
I<00:01:52.790> like<00:01:53.210> the<00:01:53.360> colors<00:01:53.630> from<00:01:53.750> this<00:01:53.990> compared<00:01:54.799> to

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
I like the colors from this compared to

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.149 
I like the colors from this compared to
that<00:01:55.100> it<00:01:55.430> shows<00:01:56.299> up<00:01:56.479> a<00:01:56.540> little<00:01:56.689> skew<00:01:57.170> on<00:01:57.439> the

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
that it shows up a little skew on the

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.069 
that it shows up a little skew on the
film<00:01:58.460> here<00:01:58.850> but<00:01:59.030> you<00:01:59.119> get<00:01:59.299> more<00:01:59.479> in<00:01:59.630> depth<00:01:59.900> on

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
film here but you get more in depth on

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:01.929 
film here but you get more in depth on
this<00:02:00.290> side<00:02:00.500> than<00:02:00.680> you<00:02:00.710> do<00:02:00.890> on<00:02:01.070> that<00:02:01.100> side<00:02:01.520> it's

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
this side than you do on that side it's

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.260 
this side than you do on that side it's
kind<00:02:02.150> of<00:02:02.180> washed<00:02:02.450> out<00:02:02.689> over<00:02:02.960> there<00:02:03.110> but<00:02:04.270> the

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
kind of washed out over there but the

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.990 
kind of washed out over there but the
projector<00:02:05.840> this<00:02:06.740> one<00:02:07.009> is<00:02:07.130> not<00:02:07.250> running<00:02:07.520> in<00:02:07.729> Eco

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
projector this one is not running in Eco

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.229 
projector this one is not running in Eco
mode

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
mode

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:12.280 
mode
neither<00:02:08.660> is<00:02:08.840> this<00:02:08.989> one<00:02:10.600> okay<00:02:11.600> so<00:02:11.750> you<00:02:11.989> kind<00:02:12.260> of

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
neither is this one okay so you kind of

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.960 
neither is this one okay so you kind of
get<00:02:12.410> an<00:02:12.530> idea<00:02:12.590> it<00:02:12.980> is<00:02:13.010> pretty<00:02:13.340> bright<00:02:13.610> off<00:02:13.790> to

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
get an idea it is pretty bright off to

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.949 
get an idea it is pretty bright off to
the<00:02:14.060> right<00:02:14.209> four<00:02:15.200> feet<00:02:15.530> from<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.040> projectors

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
the right four feet from the projectors

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.680 
the right four feet from the projectors
to<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.110> screen<00:02:18.470> and<00:02:18.709> you're<00:02:19.700> getting<00:02:19.970> I<00:02:20.209> would

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
to the screen and you're getting I would

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.040 
to the screen and you're getting I would
say<00:02:21.489> 30%<00:02:22.489> more<00:02:23.030> off<00:02:23.269> to<00:02:23.720> the

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
say 30% more off to the

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.770 
say 30% more off to the

anything different it just means you

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.550 
anything different it just means you
have<00:02:28.280> to<00:02:28.340> move<00:02:28.490> your<00:02:28.640> mount<00:02:28.930> further<00:02:29.930> closer
