very very quick now to get the honey up
from<00:00:15.080> my<00:00:16.080> frame<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:16.859> need<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.850> get<00:00:18.000> rid<00:00:18.180> of<00:00:18.270> this

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
from my frame I need to get rid of this

from my frame I need to get rid of this
wax<00:00:18.690> capping<00:00:19.230> that<00:00:19.260> these<00:00:19.859> are<00:00:20.100> put<00:00:20.279> on<00:00:20.369> the

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
wax capping that these are put on the

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.359 
wax capping that these are put on the
outside<00:00:20.880> so<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.210> do<00:00:21.449> that<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:22.020> have<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:23.070> nun

sharp so what I'm going to do is make a
messy<00:00:32.009> credit<00:00:32.640> put<00:00:32.820> your<00:00:32.910> mouths<00:00:33.120> open<00:00:33.329> the

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
messy credit put your mouths open the

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.110 
messy credit put your mouths open the
front<00:00:33.840> rows<00:00:34.140> I'm<00:00:34.440> on<00:00:34.590> flick<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.010> up<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:36.030> I'm

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
front rows I'm on flick it up so I'm

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.110 
front rows I'm on flick it up so I'm
going<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.300> slice<00:00:36.920> down<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.250> top<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.790> cell

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
going to slice down the top of the cell

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.160 
going to slice down the top of the cell
and<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.840> can<00:00:39.989> see<00:00:40.260> underneath<00:00:40.649> there<00:00:41.840> all<00:00:42.840> my

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
and you can see underneath there all my

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.610 
and you can see underneath there all my
honey<00:00:43.670> is<00:00:44.670> exposed<00:00:45.239> underneath<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.379> let's

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
honey is exposed underneath and let's

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.580 
honey is exposed underneath and let's
see<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:47.070> showing<00:00:47.370> them<00:00:47.610> away<00:00:47.820> there<00:00:48.120> now<00:00:48.809> to

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
see that showing them away there now to

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.590 
see that showing them away there now to
get<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.980> honey<00:00:50.219> out<00:00:50.340> from<00:00:50.700> there<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:51.329> goes

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
get the honey out from there it goes

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.319 
get the honey out from there it goes
into<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:52.020> machine<00:00:52.230> this<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.620> called<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.460> honey

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
into this machine this is called a honey

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.389 
into this machine this is called a honey
extractor<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.170> basically<00:00:55.739> eccentric<00:00:56.250> you

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
extractor and is basically eccentric you

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.020 
extractor and is basically eccentric you
use<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:56.969> centrifugal<00:00:57.629> force<00:00:58.020> so<00:00:58.620> as<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:58.949> spin<00:00:59.820> it

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
use a centrifugal force so as I spin it

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.030 
use a centrifugal force so as I spin it
around<00:01:00.680> if<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:02.190> wash<00:01:02.399> your<00:01:02.579> spy<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.300> glass

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
around if you wash your spy to the glass

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.590 
around if you wash your spy to the glass
if<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.220> see<00:01:05.430> little<00:01:05.670> bits<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:05.939> honey<00:01:06.150> flicking

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
if I see little bits of honey flicking

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.190 
if I see little bits of honey flicking
out<00:01:06.720> there<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.110> getting<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.409> side<00:01:07.820> so<00:01:09.140> on<00:01:10.140> a

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
out there and getting the side so on a

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.219 
out there and getting the side so on a
commercial<00:01:10.619> scale<00:01:11.270> same<00:01:12.270> principle<00:01:12.630> applies

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
commercial scale same principle applies

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.679 
commercial scale same principle applies
but<00:01:13.979> obviously<00:01:14.670> there's<00:01:14.970> not<00:01:15.150> someone<00:01:15.390> doing

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
but obviously there's not someone doing

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.929 
but obviously there's not someone doing
this<00:01:15.960> all<00:01:16.170> day<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:17.040> push<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.340> button<00:01:17.670> the

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
this all day you push a button the

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.820 
this all day you push a button the
machine<00:01:18.270> does<00:01:18.509> this<00:01:18.720> whole<00:01:18.900> process<00:01:19.170> for<00:01:19.710> it

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
machine does this whole process for it

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.710 
machine does this whole process for it
what's<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.549> principle<00:01:21.119> still<00:01:21.360> using

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
what's a principle still using

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.620 
what's a principle still using
centrifuge<00:01:22.320> now<00:01:22.890> gravity<00:01:23.850> takes<00:01:24.119> over<00:01:24.330> and

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
centrifuge now gravity takes over and

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.370 
centrifuge now gravity takes over and
that<00:01:24.750> honey

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
that honey

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.830 
that honey
already<00:01:25.619> see<00:01:25.829> it<00:01:25.950> starting<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.790> run<00:01:27.570> down<00:01:27.810> to

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
already see it starting to run down to

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.310 
already see it starting to run down to
the<00:01:28.110> bottom<00:01:28.289> down<00:01:28.590> there<00:01:29.000> most<00:01:30.000> honey<00:01:30.479> will

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
the bottom down there most honey will

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.969 
the bottom down there most honey will
undergo<00:01:32.840> some<00:01:33.840> level<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:35.869> filtration<00:01:36.979> now

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
undergo some level of filtration now

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.429 
undergo some level of filtration now
that<00:01:38.130> takes<00:01:38.369> out<00:01:38.700> bits<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:39.149> wax<00:01:39.390> pits<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:40.110> feed

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
want to get in our honey and then you

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.990 
want to get in our honey and then you
get<00:01:45.329> left<00:01:45.659> with<00:01:47.569> pure<00:01:48.569> raw<00:01:49.429> I'm<00:01:50.429> not<00:01:50.729> going<00:01:50.909> to

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
get left with pure raw I'm not going to

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.550 
get left with pure raw I'm not going to
pour<00:01:54.890> that<00:01:55.890> costs<00:01:56.159> extra<00:01:56.420> so<00:01:57.420> pure<00:01:58.289> raw

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
pour that costs extra so pure raw

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
natural honey all of our honey out in

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.770 
natural honey all of our honey out in
the<00:02:00.840> shop<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.319> pure<00:02:01.830> honey<00:02:02.159> we<00:02:02.849> do<00:02:03.060> not<00:02:03.330> change

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
the shop is pure honey we do not change

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.169 
the shop is pure honey we do not change
it<00:02:04.229> we<00:02:04.349> do<00:02:04.530> not<00:02:04.709> add<00:02:04.920> anything<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.580> it<00:02:05.789> it's<00:02:06.030> not

heated excessively which kills the

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.669 
heated excessively which kills the
goodness<00:02:08.640> in<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.940> honey<00:02:09.149> so<00:02:09.959> it's<00:02:10.200> all<00:02:10.410> pure

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679
