is one shift clicking while crafting
makes<00:00:53.610> as<00:00:53.879> much<00:00:53.910> as<00:00:54.390> possible<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.530> moves<00:00:55.860> it

straight<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.489> inventory<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.960> here<00:00:58.289> you

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
straight to the inventory so here you

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.860 
straight to the inventory so here you
can<00:00:58.469> see<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.859> dead<00:00:59.219> shrubs<00:00:59.609> they<00:01:00.329> don't<00:01:00.539> do

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
can see the dead shrubs they don't do

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.039 
can see the dead shrubs they don't do
anything<00:01:01.109> they're<00:01:01.440> just<00:01:01.469> like<00:01:01.800> dead<00:01:02.190> saplings

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
anything they're just like dead saplings

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:07.120 
anything they're just like dead saplings
you<00:01:04.049> can't<00:01:04.320> get<00:01:04.500> them<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:04.710> your<00:01:04.860> inventory

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
you can't get them in your inventory

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.590 
you can't get them in your inventory
rather<00:01:08.130> pointless<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.909> probably<00:01:09.240> make<00:01:09.450> the

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
rather pointless and probably make the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.230 
rather pointless and probably make the
world<00:01:09.810> look<00:01:09.990> ugly<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:11.040> let's<00:01:11.280> make<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:11.909> map

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
world look ugly so let's make this map

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.270 
world look ugly so let's make this map
so<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.960> need<00:01:13.140> 8<00:01:13.350> bits<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.920> paper<00:01:14.570> in<00:01:16.280> that

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
so you need 8 bits of paper in that

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.280 
so you need 8 bits of paper in that
configuration<00:01:17.610> right<00:01:18.150> there<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.570> one

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
configuration right there and one

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.640 
configuration right there and one
compass<00:01:19.860> which<00:01:20.580> will<00:01:20.790> make<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.150> map<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.689> what

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
compass which will make the map and what

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.420 
compass which will make the map and what
you<00:01:22.740> do<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.159> look<00:01:23.670> down<00:01:25.009> and<00:01:26.009> when<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.250> walk

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
you do is look down and when you walk

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.880 
you do is look down and when you walk
around<00:01:28.009> it<00:01:29.009> updates<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.670> map<00:01:30.740> simple<00:01:31.740> as<00:01:31.860> that

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
around it updates the map simple as that

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.640 
around it updates the map simple as that
and<00:01:32.689> at<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.780> moment<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:34.140> don't<00:01:34.170> think<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.530> can

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
and at the moment I don't think you can

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.620 
and at the moment I don't think you can
set<00:01:34.950> waypoints<00:01:35.189> because<00:01:35.850> when<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.090> do<00:01:36.270> when

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
set waypoints because when you do when

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.789 
set waypoints because when you do when
you<00:01:36.720> try<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:36.990> click<00:01:37.200> on<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.439> map<00:01:37.619> or

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
you try and click on the map or

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.710 
you try and click on the map or
something<00:01:37.920> nothing<00:01:38.250> happens<00:01:40.700> so<00:01:41.700> yeah<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.299> will

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
trap doors the one thing that sucks is

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.690 
trap doors the one thing that sucks is
it<00:02:32.940> can<00:02:33.090> only<00:02:33.270> go<00:02:33.630> on<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.440> bottom<00:02:35.370> of<00:02:35.580> the

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
it can only go on the bottom of the

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.240 
it can only go on the bottom of the
block<00:02:35.910> not<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.450> top<00:02:36.690> so<00:02:37.440> if<00:02:37.560> I<00:02:37.650> wanted<00:02:37.890> it<00:02:38.070> to

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
block not the top so if I wanted it to

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.760 
block not the top so if I wanted it to
go<00:02:38.460> at<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.120> top<00:02:39.390> here<00:02:39.630> it<00:02:39.900> wouldn't<00:02:40.440> it'll<00:02:40.620> go

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
go at the top here it wouldn't it'll go

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.800 
go at the top here it wouldn't it'll go
down<00:02:40.800> there<00:02:41.190> so<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.120> have<00:02:42.270> to<00:02:42.390> have<00:02:42.510> a<00:02:42.540> block

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
down there so you have to have a block

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.970 
down there so you have to have a block
like<00:02:42.990> that<00:02:44.300> so<00:02:45.300> let<00:02:45.450> me<00:02:45.480> try<00:02:45.870> it<00:02:45.930> like<00:02:46.740> what<00:02:46.950> I

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
like that so let me try it like what I

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.100 
like that so let me try it like what I
was<00:02:47.160> trying<00:02:47.459> to<00:02:47.490> say<00:02:47.700> here<00:02:47.970> so<00:02:48.180> instead<00:02:48.930> of<00:02:48.990> it

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
was trying to say here so instead of it

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.720 
was trying to say here so instead of it
on<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.320> bottom<00:02:49.530> of<00:02:49.770> this<00:02:49.860> block<00:02:50.160> I<00:02:50.310> wanted<00:02:50.610> at

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
on the bottom of this block I wanted at

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.730 
on the bottom of this block I wanted at
the<00:02:50.910> top<00:02:51.150> of<00:02:51.180> that<00:02:51.390> block<00:02:51.570> but<00:02:52.050> it<00:02:52.170> won't<00:02:52.380> we'll

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
the top of that block but it won't we'll

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:59.180 
the top of that block but it won't we'll
go<00:02:52.920> down<00:02:53.100> there<00:02:54.680> which<00:02:55.680> is<00:02:55.890> rather<00:02:56.100> I<00:02:58.190> don't

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
go down there which is rather I don't

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.930 
go down there which is rather I don't
really<00:02:59.340> like<00:02:59.670> that<00:03:01.100> so<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.370> sum<00:03:02.580> of<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.760> new

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
really like that so the sum of the new

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.020 
really like that so the sum of the new
changes<00:03:03.270> was<00:03:03.660> disabling<00:03:04.350> advanced<00:03:05.010> OpenGL<00:03:05.670> so

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
changes was disabling advanced OpenGL so

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.090 
changes was disabling advanced OpenGL so
I<00:03:06.060> was<00:03:06.180> a<00:03:06.239> few<00:03:06.450> bugs<00:03:06.690> made<00:03:07.350> Brewster<00:03:07.800> tracks

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
I was a few bugs made Brewster tracks

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.740 
I was a few bugs made Brewster tracks
pedia<00:03:08.580> and<00:03:09.080> the<00:03:10.080> when<00:03:10.800> two<00:03:11.220> carts<00:03:12.000> go<00:03:12.480> right

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
pedia and the when two carts go right

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.900 
pedia and the when two carts go right
next<00:03:13.019> to<00:03:13.110> each<00:03:13.200> other<00:03:13.380> they<00:03:13.560> used<00:03:13.769> to<00:03:14.010> go

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
next to each other they used to go

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.780 
next to each other they used to go
really<00:03:15.150> fast<00:03:15.540> and<00:03:16.160> now<00:03:17.160> it<00:03:17.310> doesn't<00:03:17.670> they

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
really fast and now it doesn't they

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.830 
really fast and now it doesn't they
don't<00:03:18.030> create<00:03:18.630> any<00:03:18.720> friction<00:03:19.340> so<00:03:20.340> they<00:03:20.519> don't

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
don't create any friction so they don't

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.540 
don't create any friction so they don't
speed<00:03:21.840> anyway<00:03:22.170> they<00:03:22.410> just<00:03:22.620> stay<00:03:23.040> there<00:03:23.280> like

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
speed anyway they just stay there like

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.070 
speed anyway they just stay there like
normal<00:03:23.940> carts<00:03:24.300> like<00:03:24.480> they're<00:03:24.690> not<00:03:24.810> even

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
normal carts like they're not even

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.670 
normal carts like they're not even
touching<00:03:25.350> each<00:03:25.650> other<00:03:26.720> 107<00:03:27.720> bugs<00:03:28.019> fixed<00:03:28.530> or

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
touching each other 107 bugs fixed or

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.100 
touching each other 107 bugs fixed or
