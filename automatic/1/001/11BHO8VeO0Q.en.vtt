this<00:01:19.460> is<00:01:19.610> a<00:01:19.640> very<00:01:19.760> simple<00:01:20.150> one<00:01:20.750> penny<00:01:21.080> solution

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
this is a very simple one penny solution

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:33.820 
this is a very simple one penny solution
slip<00:01:23.869> it<00:01:23.990> inside<00:01:31.330> let<00:01:32.330> there<00:01:32.510> be<00:01:32.540> light<00:01:32.840> so

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
slip it inside let there be light so

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.120 
slip it inside let there be light so
clearly<00:01:34.310> that<00:01:34.430> works<00:01:35.229> now<00:01:36.229> the<00:01:36.860> next<00:01:36.890> question

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
clearly that works now the next question

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.219 
clearly that works now the next question
is<00:01:37.580> does<00:01:38.060> that<00:01:38.299> work<00:01:38.540> with<00:01:40.840> standard<00:01:41.840> alkaline

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
is does that work with standard alkaline

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.130 
is does that work with standard alkaline
battery<00:01:42.590> will<00:01:42.890> show<00:01:43.070> you<00:01:43.159> that<00:01:43.280> it<00:01:43.400> does<00:01:44.140> take

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
battery will show you that it does take

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.789
