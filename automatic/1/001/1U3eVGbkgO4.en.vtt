00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.510 
we just had a lot of moisture stream in
that<00:02:03.570> front<00:02:03.780> allowing<00:02:04.380> us<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.920> spark<00:02:05.340> off<00:02:05.490> the

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
that front allowing us to spark off the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.789 
that front allowing us to spark off the
showers<00:02:06.030> in<00:02:06.180> our<00:02:06.299> area<00:02:06.689> they<00:02:07.079> are<00:02:07.110> beginning

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
to taper they continue to push off

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.210 
to taper they continue to push off
towards<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.780> south<00:02:10.020> will<00:02:10.470> be<00:02:10.619> left<00:02:10.950> with

overnight<00:02:13.540> now<00:02:14.050> here's<00:02:14.319> the<00:02:14.440> one<00:02:14.620> thing<00:02:14.830> wins

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
overnight now here's the one thing wins

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.280 
overnight now here's the one thing wins
they<00:02:15.640> will<00:02:15.790> start<00:02:16.000> to<00:02:16.060> shift<00:02:16.450> overnight<00:02:17.080> they

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
they will start to shift overnight they

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.750 
they will start to shift overnight they
will<00:02:17.410> start<00:02:17.590> to<00:02:17.680> move<00:02:17.890> in<00:02:18.010> from<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:18.310> north<00:02:18.550> and

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.280 
will start to move in from the north and
the<00:02:18.819> Northeast<00:02:19.300> so<00:02:19.450> this<00:02:19.630> is<00:02:19.780> going<00:02:20.050> to<00:02:20.170> allow

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
the Northeast so this is going to allow

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.470 
the Northeast so this is going to allow
some<00:02:20.680> lake<00:02:20.860> effect<00:02:20.890> cloud<00:02:21.370> cover<00:02:21.670> and<00:02:21.849> also

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
some lake effect cloud cover and also
