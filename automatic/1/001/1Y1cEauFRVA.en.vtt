00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:09.160
 so hello and welcome to the sprints 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.480
 in the running mode for the twin copies 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.210
 As you can see , the video will be something again 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.070
 played faster than with you one 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.510
 Insight into the fight and what 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.710
 to pay attention to this quarter 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:22.000
 have to do practically 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:24.220
 we are there two opponents and once 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.040
 you start the fiercely strong in 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.560
 the so-called naked phase and it is 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.379
 the real opponent active and the second 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.320
 queen appears only briefly and 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:36.789
 caused damage so you can with 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.489
 ignore us skillfully then you have to 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:40.899
 just go on the twin and pay attention 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.480
 you should do that later 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:45.670
 in the video you can see these flowers as it 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.609
 appear over the entire surface 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.039
 such plants continue to sink in the picture 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:53.050
 could already recognize these and the 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:55.359
 but a green cloud and wants 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.129
 I sleep the green cloud until then 

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:58.839
 your character current stood in 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.659
 Austria will become the picture or 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:05.350
 wait is applause and these greens 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:07.780
 Fields of green puddles are moving 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.580
 constant again and again by the raiders 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.710
 who have no fixed did but we 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.660
 can also turn around and so, therefore, 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.300
 always make sure that he is far 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:19.380
 enough of them to stand with you 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.380
 just do not get caught 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.620
 otherwise it takes about three minutes 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.480
 fighting time so after three minutes the 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.150
 sportbundes starts the day in the 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:38.790
 did we lower then the other is active 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:41.410
 and the opponent only appears 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.570
 briefly and positioned one with 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.880
 higher but equal to that more me 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.940
 then only relevant for the tanks 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.100
 as they pull the posthumously with the 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.110
 and that is why so that 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.510
 stacks expire it starts at the 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:59.260
 nose there is simply distributed 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.370
 again around the opponent and the whole makes 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.800
 normal with it already by the post 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.630
 stuck up high who the harm 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.850
 increased and now you can right and with 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.479
 She landed and she had to 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.280
 the tank simply the active tenk 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.930
 practically just pull and post 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.999
 then the stacks turns on itself 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.450
 started the fund tuned and the 

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:21.010
 middle does not stay there forever but he 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.680
 also has a life bar and 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.319
 more detailed of the match always 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.659
 again hp and then of course down 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.219
 what we have seen before the big one 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:32.290
 they will wake up later, too 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:35.439
 see a big winner and that 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.799
 it is so on the ends so in the times 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:40.659
 there is a room from this room 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.950
 respective symbol to click on and if 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:45.879
 you then click here comes one 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.980
 parallel parallel world and there would have to 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:49.329
 then practically a star pattern 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.939
 trace which is given and 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:55.239
 as soon as you've done that, activate the 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:57.459
 practically the bass so that the 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.549
 for example the tiger or the cranes 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.170
 which then intervene in the fight above 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:04.180
 if you are nice to do that 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.099
 can not necessarily now in 11er 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.450
 necessary but first want to see the 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.680
 I would like to do so, too 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.079
 walk to the side 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.879
 Click the icon and then it will be 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:15.129
 you down below and then the world counts 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:16.959
 He had to draw as soon as possible 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:18.909
 you 've drawn that lay and right 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.430
 he has traced again 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:24.209
 above and then i asked the bug 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.209
 area 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:34.020
 now are the three minutes for the 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.790
 second opponent left and so over and 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.980
 now you can see are both 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.970
 active at the same time and that changes 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.010
 not anymore 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.200
 that means the second one is active for so long 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.880
 so far both have killed or so far 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.489
 practically remains overlapping now 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.790
 some skills with it is on 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:53.069
 easiest if you just nice to 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.560
 the bosses tries to get in the middle 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:58.920
 Keep and also pay attention that you 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.930
 is looking forward to chile reach 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.060
 and then you kill those bets 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.709
 come before the previous phase 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.120
 and only have relatively little life left 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.640
 point so here is the best 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.800
 possibility to fight and 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.580
 after that you just kill these and that 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.830
 That's it 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.019
 I hope we could communicate with ours 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.930
 give ambitious good insight we have 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.579
 Now all ler now complete and 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.140
 blowing in the playlist for all bosses 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.880
 should there be any questions 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.919
 this just right in the video in the 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.160
 come and ask there and see you next 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.160
 times
