moment to recognize some other stove

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:20.430 
moment to recognize some other stove
builders<00:00:18.670> and<00:00:18.820> I<00:00:18.910> think<00:00:19.179> are<00:00:19.300> doing<00:00:19.570> a<00:00:19.750> really

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:20.440 
builders and I think are doing a really

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.600 
builders and I think are doing a really
good<00:00:20.740> job<00:00:20.800> I<00:00:22.470> know<00:00:23.470> that's<00:00:23.680> uncommon<00:00:24.160> for<00:00:24.550> a

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:24.610 
good job I know that's uncommon for a

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.120 
good job I know that's uncommon for a
builder<00:00:25.090> to<00:00:25.360> talk<00:00:26.199> about<00:00:26.380> his<00:00:26.590> competition
