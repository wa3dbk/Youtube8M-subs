changed<00:02:46.620> to<00:02:46.890> diamond<00:02:47.790> so<00:02:48.450> that's<00:02:48.630> a<00:02:48.750> little

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
changed to diamond so that's a little

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.430 
changed to diamond so that's a little
bit<00:02:49.050> different<00:02:49.440> there<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:51.080> bandit<00:02:52.080> is<00:02:52.260> going

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
bit different there and bandit is going

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.030 
bit different there and bandit is going
to<00:02:52.500> be<00:02:52.620> quartz<00:02:53.100> so<00:02:53.850> that's<00:02:54.060> all<00:02:54.300> eight

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
to be quartz so that's all eight
