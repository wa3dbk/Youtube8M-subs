Airs<00:00:20.130> are<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.310> bit<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.609> special<00:00:20.820> case<00:00:21.000> unlike

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
Airs are a bit of a special case unlike

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.779 
Airs are a bit of a special case unlike
the<00:00:22.140> traditional<00:00:22.289> windows-based<00:00:23.160> notebook

or even the older Mac based notebooks it
doesn't<00:00:26.460> actually<00:00:26.580> have<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:27.000> discrete<00:00:27.689> SSD

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470

drive in the shape of an old hard drive
inside<00:00:30.689> this<00:00:31.199> case<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.619> just<00:00:31.740> uses<00:00:32.189> something

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
inside this case it just uses something

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.240 
inside this case it just uses something
called<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.850> module<00:00:33.530> now<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.559> module<00:00:34.950> contains

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
called a module now a module contains

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.709 
called a module now a module contains
all<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.489> same<00:00:35.670> components<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.300> regular

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
all the same components that a regular

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.420 
all the same components that a regular
SSD<00:00:37.170> drive<00:00:37.380> does<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.770> just<00:00:37.920> doesn't<00:00:38.160> have<00:00:38.280> all

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
SSD drive does it just doesn't have all

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.160 
SSD drive does it just doesn't have all
the<00:00:38.550> packaging<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.239> fit<00:00:39.480> into<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.899> space<00:00:40.140> and

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
the packaging to fit into the space and

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.470 
the packaging to fit into the space and
an<00:00:40.410> old<00:00:40.590> hard<00:00:40.890> drive<00:00:41.070> would<00:00:41.250> have<00:00:41.399> vacated<00:00:41.820> so

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
an old hard drive would have vacated so

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.450 
an old hard drive would have vacated so
it<00:00:42.540> allows<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.899> SSD<00:00:43.440> module<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.040> be<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.160> lot

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
it allows the SSD module to be a lot

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.459 
it allows the SSD module to be a lot
smaller<00:00:44.969> than<00:00:45.300> an<00:00:45.480> old-school<00:00:45.809> hard<00:00:46.230> drive

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
smaller than an old-school hard drive

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.229 
smaller than an old-school hard drive
now<00:00:47.250> what<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.399> means<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:47.879> can't<00:00:48.090> just

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
now what that means is you can't just

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.000 
now what that means is you can't just
walk<00:00:48.450> into<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.750> store<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.110> buy<00:00:49.320> one<00:00:49.710> off<00:00:49.860> the

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
walk into a store and buy one off the

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.290 
walk into a store and buy one off the
shelf<00:00:50.039> like<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.550> could<00:00:50.730> with<00:00:50.850> an<00:00:50.969> SSD

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
shelf like you could with an SSD

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.060 
shelf like you could with an SSD
designed<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.899> replace<00:00:52.140> an<00:00:52.410> old<00:00:52.590> hard<00:00:52.890> drive

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
designed to replace an old hard drive

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.310 
designed to replace an old hard drive
and<00:00:53.250> fit<00:00:53.399> into<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.730> same<00:00:53.910> space<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:55.110> can

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
and fit into the same space you can

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.049 
and fit into the same space you can
order<00:00:55.710> them<00:00:55.860> online<00:00:56.070> however<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.820> we<00:00:56.910> got

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
order them online however and we got

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.549 
order them online however and we got

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
fact you can take the old one out and

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.280 
fact you can take the old one out and
take<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.210> new<00:01:06.360> one<00:01:06.540> in<00:01:06.689> this<00:01:06.780> case<00:01:06.960> we've<00:01:07.170> got

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
take the new one in this case we've got

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.500 
take the new one in this case we've got
the<00:01:07.409> mercury<00:01:07.830> Pro<00:01:08.130> or<00:01:08.340> Express<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.119> just

slide<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:09.900> back<00:01:10.020> into<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.380> same<00:01:10.530> interface

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
slide it back into the same interface

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.490 
slide it back into the same interface
that<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.220> old<00:01:11.369> SSD<00:01:11.909> drive<00:01:12.150> came<00:01:12.420> out<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.810> in

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
that the old SSD drive came out of in

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.030 
that the old SSD drive came out of in
the<00:01:13.590> past

the past

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.620 
the past
Apple<00:01:14.280> used<00:01:14.460> something<00:01:14.610> called<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.939> Torx<00:01:15.330> screw

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
Apple used something called a Torx screw

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.149 
Apple used something called a Torx screw
to<00:01:15.750> fasten<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.140> backing<00:01:16.530> plates<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.009> back

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
to fasten the backing plates to the back

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.280 
to fasten the backing plates to the back
of<00:01:17.340> MacBooks<00:01:17.820> but<00:01:18.570> they<00:01:18.720> try<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:18.960> keep<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.259> out

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
of MacBooks but they try to keep you out

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.480 
of MacBooks but they try to keep you out
of<00:01:19.530> these<00:01:19.619> things<00:01:19.860> for<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.100> most<00:01:20.220> part

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
switched over to a newer type of screw

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.550 
switched over to a newer type of screw
that<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.450> less<00:01:27.689> common<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.290> might<00:01:28.439> have

trouble finding the screw driver for
this<00:01:30.210> it's<00:01:30.600> called<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.900> pentalobe<00:01:31.380> now<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:32.280> this

case you do get the screw drivers inside
the<00:01:34.470> kit<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.159> don't<00:01:35.400> have<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.640> worry<00:01:35.820> about

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
the kit so you don't have to worry about

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.789 
the kit so you don't have to worry about
that<00:01:36.180> so<00:01:36.450> much<00:01:36.630> if<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.409> do<00:01:37.530> find<00:01:37.740> a

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
that so much if you do find a

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.410 
that so much if you do find a

replacement module for the MacBook Air

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.550 
replacement module for the MacBook Air
but<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.720> don't<00:01:39.900> have<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.200> screw<00:01:40.439> driver

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
but you don't have the screw driver

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.380 
but you don't have the screw driver
itself<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.369> can<00:01:41.610> order<00:01:41.880> these<00:01:42.000> separately

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
itself you can order these separately

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.929 
itself you can order these separately
online<00:01:42.869> as<00:01:43.079> well<00:01:43.320> now<00:01:44.310> before<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.640> start<00:01:44.700> the

online as well now before you start the

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.340 
online as well now before you start the
process<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.420> swapping<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.869> modules<00:01:46.229> out

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
process of swapping the modules out

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.350 
process of swapping the modules out
because<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.799> modules<00:01:47.159> do<00:01:47.579> function<00:01:47.970> like<00:01:48.210> the

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
because the modules do function like the

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.940 
because the modules do function like the
hard<00:01:48.509> drives<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.899> will<00:01:49.140> want<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.439> backup<00:01:49.710> the

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950

external drive and then copy it over to
the<00:01:54.210> new<00:01:54.329> one<00:01:54.479> once<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:54.840> have<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.140> installed

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
the new one once you have that installed

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.109 
the new one once you have that installed
now<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.399> can<00:01:56.610> use<00:01:56.759> something<00:01:56.969> like

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
now you can use something like

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.910 
now you can use something like
superduper<00:01:57.899> or<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.170> can<00:01:58.290> just<00:01:58.439> use<00:01:58.500> time

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
superduper or you can just use time

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.709 
superduper or you can just use time
machine<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.430> backup<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.850> an<00:02:00.060> external<00:02:00.390> drive

machine to backup to an external drive

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.539 
machine to backup to an external drive
and<00:02:00.750> then<00:02:00.960> pull<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.259> information<00:02:01.469> over<00:02:02.009> once

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
and then pull that information over once

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.280 
and then pull that information over once
you're<00:02:02.729> done<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.810> first<00:02:03.990> step<00:02:04.140> in<00:02:04.229> the

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
you're done so the first step in the

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.600 
you're done so the first step in the
process<00:02:04.380> of<00:02:04.710> course<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.130> power<00:02:05.310> down<00:02:05.430> your

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
process of course is to power down your

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.100 
process of course is to power down your
macbook<00:02:05.969> air<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.329> remove<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.659> from<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.930> power

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
keep them in a safe place so you don't

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.550 
keep them in a safe place so you don't
lose<00:02:11.849> them<00:02:11.879> they're<00:02:12.209> very<00:02:12.239> hard<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:12.690> replace

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
lose them they're very hard to replace

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.440 
lose them they're very hard to replace
inside<00:02:14.430> you'll<00:02:14.640> see<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.790> bunch<00:02:14.970> of<00:02:15.060> battery

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450
