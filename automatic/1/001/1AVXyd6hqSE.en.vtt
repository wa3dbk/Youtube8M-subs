00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 that I would be very rich I knew 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:10.590
 it seems from early childhood 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:13.519
 just knew that's all with the fact that i 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.580
 almost gras messenger of the Great Depression 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:20.189
 born in 30 mahi nebraska father 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.199
 trader on the stock exchange is very successful from him 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.230
 then I probably inherited a love for 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.240
 numbers any numbers memorized on the fly in 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.730
 three years all amazed at what he could without 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.090
 errors name the amount of population in 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.640
 All the big cities of the United States and my grandfather was 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.309
 the store was small I was 6 when in 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.660
 grandfather in the store I bought my blood 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.260
 pocket money 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.500
 6 bottles of cola 25 cents each 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.149
 do not worry do not drink and has not pitched well 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.910
 dragged this considerable for me 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.039
 six-year cargo to the house where with 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.340
 easily sold all six bottles 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:00.300
 price of 50 cents per unit sold 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.430
 mom dad and other homework twisting 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.860
 this terrible good deal 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.450
 I got into my children's hands 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:13.470
 a colossal sum for three dollars but 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:17.640
 the main thing was not even this feeling 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.740
 incomparable sunny ringing 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:25.680
 sense of success 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:28.409
 absolutely priceless at 11 I got 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.320
 five dollars on the sale of the first three 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.330
 of my shares and also generally rejoiced 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.080
 I bought them at thirty-eight 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:40.020
 bucks for each and suddenly they fell to 27 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.780
 and then soared to 40 here I am naturally 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.789
 decided to get rid of them and fix 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.789
 bubble in a couple of days 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:53.689
 I saw that their price had broken 200 dollars 

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:03.539
 what I felt at this moment is not 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.940
 I will only say that the feelings are extremely 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:09.299
 foul but extremely useful 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.880
 that's when i swore that never 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:12.690
 never again rush to 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.250
 by decisions 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:19.590
 if it comes to money so here to now 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.920
 pore between these two feeling live like 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.500
 between the sun and darkness by the way now i'm not 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.850
 just not in a hurry to sell stocks I them 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.430
 I do not sell at all 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.280
 because the action then I have just the best of 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.590
 outstanding companies and therefore can 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.290
 only go up to fluctuations of course 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.079
 happen but if you do not save full 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.930
 calm when course owned 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:45.450
 you shares fall by 50 percent on 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.730
 Exchange you have nothing to do at least 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.400
 so says one of my brand 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.440
 aphorisms and by the way is considered one of 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.170
 the main financial gurus of the planet 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.180
 my name is not the best investor in the world 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.880
 so long ago i was one of the most 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.280
 the rich people on earth have not yet given away two 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.580
 third of the state for charity 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.220
 I agree 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.920
 to do that besides exact 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.430
 some more 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.440
 the breadth of feeling still me all the time 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.020
 ask if wealth changes 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.260
 I answer the person does not change but only 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.630
 underlines the true essence here among 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.280
 my billionaires have such acquaintances 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.340
 who are not rich yet 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.520
 were complete nonentities now they 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:37.270
 Exactly the same insignificance only 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:39.970
 a billion bucks warren baffet one of 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.000
 the largest and most famous investors in 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.000
 the world
