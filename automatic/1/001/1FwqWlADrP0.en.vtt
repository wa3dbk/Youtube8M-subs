00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.130
 helau sexy boys here would be a tutorial 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:09.929
 by just ketchup how to get the character 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:13.620
 lets talk or how to get the 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:16.109
 I synchronize fundamental movements 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.880
 use the program papagayo where 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.830
 you downloaded it and how her 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.070
 installed because you extra German 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.390
 language package needs that you will find 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.160
 in the video description 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.619
 I'll just show you how to do it 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.210
 as I do that I like the 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.390
 Synchronize mouth movements 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:38.100
 So we have in the tutorial before 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.110
 movements mouth movements sight these 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.309
 Mouth movements also uses the program 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:48.559
 papagayo open my audio file now 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:53.030
 I love ketchup and breasts 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:54.860
 I say now in the text I love 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:02.190
 Ketchup 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:06.540
 And that would be the text I love 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.760
 ketchup and breasts so now i have that 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.620
 insert text 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.820
 Now I'm going to breakdown you see 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.330
 here i have the german language 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:19.350
 you can also do it for other languages 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:23.040
 breakdown now he breaks my 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.479
 whole words in this and movements 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.479
 which I have in here too 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:36.540
 and that makes me a practical one 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.440
 this mobile here and now has to stop 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.450
 to adjust 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:56.520
 that means it's a nice one 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:02:09.030
 effort there is the word I am then 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:12.360
 Here comes a break I had to love 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.060
 ketchup and breasts you see that 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.480
 Mouth movements will be in the program 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:24.090
 indicated and that I am here 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:27.000
 the sound effects adapted the the 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:31.110
 words to the audio track fit the 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.110
 Mouth movements love ketchup and breasts 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.239
 Now I have this all 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.220
 split 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:42.530
 Now I go here and say export 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:46.760
 voice That's what we're all talking about here 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.760
 I'll just call it now 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:59.010
 breasts legs just say I call 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:03:02.200
 It my store exactly the record 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.330
 closes now I save the 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.180
 most of the time I do not export at all 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.970
 only the audio file so the project 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.030
 I do not think so now I go 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:18.950
 into the tutorial pure got my 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:24.980
 audio recording she throws the one here 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:28.670
 I love ketchup and so can the breasts 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:31.129
 things that push even above so 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.420
 Something like I get the file in me 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:40.760
 go on my train bat on mouth 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:42.980
 and then I tell him so that I am here 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.989
 I like to switch starter case 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.379
 just exported 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:54.140
 want to import the on audio and the 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:55.220
 This set is the most complete 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:00.019
 after all, that's the way it is 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:01.459
 window from the focus house then I see 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:03.079
 here the mouth movements and now must 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:07.610
 I still hold the mouth movements 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:11.120
 It's just the beginning here 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:13.459
 decided accordingly because here how 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:17.030
 We see that now also the right of 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.979
 against the single mode movement now 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:23.710
 I let him out of the program 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:28.729
 I have love ketchup and 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:30.740
 breasts and that's all the magic 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:37.090
 behind it, then I say at the end because he 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:43.250
 the party 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:44.000
 I love ketchup and breasts and that 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.910
 That's it 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.840
 I create the sync because of that 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:53.090
 export the audio file via papagayo 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.760
 then import the file into the 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.620
 created player then with the 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.620
 Mouth movements that I have in here 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.630
 works and that's it 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.320
 Thank you for watching the tutorial 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.320
 Until next time
