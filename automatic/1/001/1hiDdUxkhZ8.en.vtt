00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.490 
show but it's basically just a non
frosted<00:01:33.119> part<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.479> case<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.350> the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
frosted part of the case so that the

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.960 
frosted part of the case so that the
oneplus<00:01:34.860> one<00:01:34.920> logo<00:01:35.220> on<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.520> back<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.700> the

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
oneplus one logo on the back of the

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.880 
oneplus one logo on the back of the
oneplus<00:01:36.299> one<00:01:36.420> isn't<00:01:36.990> blurred<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.710> looks

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
oneplus one isn't blurred so it looks

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.350 
oneplus one isn't blurred so it looks
pretty<00:01:38.130> nice<00:01:38.250> this<00:01:38.579> case<00:01:38.759> is<00:01:38.909> made<00:01:39.030> from<00:01:39.240> a

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
pretty nice this case is made from a

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.420 
pretty nice this case is made from a
polycarbonate<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.170> it's<00:01:40.590> super<00:01:41.009> flexible

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
polycarbonate and it's super flexible

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.920 
polycarbonate and it's super flexible
now<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:41.850> really<00:01:42.210> wouldn't<00:01:42.479> worry<00:01:42.630> about<00:01:42.750> it

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
now I really wouldn't worry about it

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.480 
now I really wouldn't worry about it
breaking<00:01:43.140> or<00:01:43.560> snapping<00:01:43.860> at<00:01:44.100> all<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.399> could

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
breaking or snapping at all you could

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.980 
breaking or snapping at all you could
pretty<00:01:44.670> much<00:01:44.759> bend<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.210> thing<00:01:45.420> at<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.600> 90

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
pretty much bend this thing at a 90

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.480 
pretty much bend this thing at a 90
degree<00:01:46.020> angle<00:01:46.290> where<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.920> volume<00:01:47.189> rocker<00:01:47.250> and

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
degree angle where the volume rocker and

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.760 
degree angle where the volume rocker and
power<00:01:47.880> button<00:01:48.149> sit<00:01:48.420> it's<00:01:49.200> just<00:01:49.439> super

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
power button sit it's just super

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.440 
power button sit it's just super
flexible<00:01:50.220> which<00:01:50.820> is<00:01:50.970> really<00:01:51.149> nice<00:01:51.270> because

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
flexible which is really nice because

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.969 
flexible which is really nice because
it's<00:01:51.689> definitely<00:01:52.320> going<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.500> hold<00:01:52.680> up<00:01:52.799> over

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
it's definitely going to hold up over

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.859 
it's definitely going to hold up over
time<00:01:53.009> now<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.670> does<00:01:53.759> have<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.000> small<00:01:54.329> lip<00:01:54.540> on<00:01:54.750> the

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
time now it does have a small lip on the

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.149 
time now it does have a small lip on the
front<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.200> prevent<00:01:55.470> scratches<00:01:55.860> on<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.040> screen

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
front to prevent scratches on the screen

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.830 
front to prevent scratches on the screen
if<00:01:56.610> you're<00:01:56.790> somebody<00:01:57.000> who<00:01:57.210> likes<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.570> lay<00:01:57.719> your

phone facedown but if you have something

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.670 
phone facedown but if you have something

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
like a debrand skin on the back of your

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.109 
like a debrand skin on the back of your
oneplus<00:02:01.890> one<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.610> lip<00:02:02.759> is<00:02:02.880> going<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.060> be

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
oneplus one the lip is going to be

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.060 
oneplus one the lip is going to be
pretty<00:02:03.299> much<00:02:03.479> non-existent<00:02:03.719> since<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.799> skin

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
pretty much non-existent since that skin

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.770 
pretty much non-existent since that skin
is<00:02:05.219> going<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.460> add<00:02:05.549> just<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.880> small<00:02:06.299> amount<00:02:06.689> of

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
is going to add just a small amount of

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.240 
is going to add just a small amount of
thickness<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.619> doesn't<00:02:07.829> really<00:02:07.920> bother<00:02:08.099> me

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
thickness that doesn't really bother me

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.410 
thickness that doesn't really bother me
at<00:02:08.399> all<00:02:08.459> since<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:08.819> didn't<00:02:08.970> replace<00:02:09.179> my<00:02:09.390> phone

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
at all since I didn't replace my phone

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.420 
at all since I didn't replace my phone
facedown<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.440> it's<00:02:10.709> not<00:02:10.890> like<00:02:10.979> it<00:02:11.160> makes<00:02:11.310> the

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
facedown and it's not like it makes the

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.190 
facedown and it's not like it makes the
case<00:02:11.610> fall<00:02:11.849> off<00:02:12.060> or<00:02:12.270> anything<00:02:12.480> like<00:02:12.629> that<00:02:12.780> so

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
case fall off or anything like that so

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.059 
case fall off or anything like that so
overall<00:02:13.739> this<00:02:13.860> is

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
overall this is

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.349 
overall this is
an<00:02:14.129> awesome<00:02:14.489> case<00:02:14.670> for<00:02:14.879> the<00:02:14.939> money<00:02:15.090> if<00:02:15.269> you're
