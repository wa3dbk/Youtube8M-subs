this<00:00:07.980> makes<00:00:08.280> a<00:00:08.610> nice<00:00:08.990> stretchy<00:00:09.990> bind-off<00:00:10.620> and

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
this makes a nice stretchy bind-off and

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.379 
this makes a nice stretchy bind-off and
there<00:00:11.160> are<00:00:11.280> a<00:00:11.309> few<00:00:11.520> different<00:00:11.820> ways<00:00:11.969> that<00:00:12.150> you

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
there are a few different ways that you

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.350 
there are a few different ways that you
can<00:00:12.570> do<00:00:12.780> this<00:00:13.250> the<00:00:14.250> first<00:00:14.490> way<00:00:14.820> that<00:00:14.850> I'm<00:00:15.120> going

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
can do this the first way that I'm going

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.359 
can do this the first way that I'm going
to<00:00:15.450> show<00:00:15.750> you<00:00:15.780> is<00:00:16.200> by<00:00:16.530> working<00:00:16.800> through<00:00:17.280> the

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
to show you is by working through the

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.130 
to show you is by working through the
back<00:00:17.400> loops<00:00:18.619> you'll<00:00:19.619> knit<00:00:19.890> two<00:00:20.580> together

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
back loops you'll knit two together

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:29.040 
back loops you'll knit two together
through<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.320> back<00:00:22.350> loop

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.230 

then<00:00:29.679> you'll<00:00:29.859> return<00:00:30.250> the<00:00:30.310> stitch<00:00:30.759> that's<00:00:31.029> on

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.240 
then you'll return the stitch that's on

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.960 
then you'll return the stitch that's on
your<00:00:31.419> left<00:00:31.660> needle<00:00:32.190> to<00:00:33.190> the<00:00:33.220> right<00:00:33.370> needle

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:33.970 
your left needle to the right needle

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.030 
your left needle to the right needle
just<00:00:34.780> like<00:00:35.050> that<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:38.410> then<00:00:38.530> again<00:00:38.800> you'll

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
just like that and then again you'll

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:52.670 
just like that and then again you'll
knit<00:00:39.220> two<00:00:39.699> together<00:00:41.250> through<00:00:42.250> the<00:00:42.550> back<00:00:42.579> loop

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.200 
stitch from the light needle goes back

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.870 
stitch from the light needle goes back
to<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.620> left<00:00:55.830> needle<00:00:58.490> that's<00:00:59.490> all<00:00:59.730> you're

00:00:59.870 --> 00:00:59.880 
to the left needle that's all you're

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.560 
to the left needle that's all you're
doing<00:00:59.989> knitting<00:01:00.989> two<00:01:01.410> together<00:01:02.420> through<00:01:03.420> the

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
doing knitting two together through the

doing knitting two together through the
back<00:01:03.600> loop

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.540 

returning<00:01:11.870> the<00:01:12.170> stitch<00:01:12.470> to<00:01:12.500> your<00:01:12.950> left<00:01:13.160> needle

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
returning the stitch to your left needle

00:01:13.550 --> 00:02:55.920 
returning the stitch to your left needle
to<00:01:13.940> be<00:01:14.060> worked<00:01:14.270> again

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.800 

the<00:02:56.379> last<00:02:56.590> two<00:02:56.980> stitches

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
the last two stitches

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.260 
the last two stitches
in<00:02:59.230> it<00:02:59.410> together<00:02:59.830> through<00:03:00.160> the<00:03:00.400> back<00:03:00.430> loop

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.780 

and<00:03:04.140> then<00:03:04.260> you<00:03:04.410> would<00:03:04.560> cut<00:03:04.800> your<00:03:05.040> tail<00:03:05.340> and

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
and then you would cut your tail and

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:12.950 
and then you would cut your tail and
weave<00:03:06.210> in<00:03:06.390> your<00:03:06.420> ends<00:03:11.570> makes<00:03:12.570> a<00:03:12.720> pretty

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
weave in your ends makes a pretty

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:19.520 
weave in your ends makes a pretty
flexible<00:03:13.290> bind<00:03:13.920> off<00:03:14.160> edge<00:03:18.110> instead<00:03:19.110> of

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
flexible bind off edge instead of

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.560 
flexible bind off edge instead of
knitting<00:03:20.010> two<00:03:20.340> together<00:03:20.460> through<00:03:21.240> the<00:03:21.540> back

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
knitting two together through the back

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.260 
knitting two together through the back
loop<00:03:21.780> you<00:03:22.620> can<00:03:22.770> just<00:03:22.950> knit<00:03:23.130> two<00:03:23.640> together<00:03:23.790> as

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
loop you can just knit two together as

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.190 
loop you can just knit two together as
you<00:03:24.450> normally<00:03:24.690> would

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
you normally would

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.350 
you normally would
through<00:03:25.710> the<00:03:25.830> front<00:03:26.070> loops<00:03:28.940> put<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:30.060> stitch

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
through the front loops put the stitch

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.280 
through the front loops put the stitch
back<00:03:30.630> on<00:03:30.870> your<00:03:31.020> left<00:03:31.230> needle<00:03:32.900> knit<00:03:33.900> two

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
back on your left needle knit two

00:03:34.290 --> 00:04:12.220 
back on your left needle knit two
together<00:03:34.440> through<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.160> front<00:03:35.430> loop

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.600 

and<00:04:13.230> then<00:04:13.380> the<00:04:13.470> same<00:04:13.650> thing<00:04:13.920> when<00:04:14.069> you<00:04:14.099> get<00:04:14.340> to

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
and then the same thing when you get to

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.539 
and then the same thing when you get to
the<00:04:14.760> end<00:04:14.970> of<00:04:15.240> this<00:04:15.420> you<00:04:15.690> would<00:04:16.100> work<00:04:17.100> your<00:04:17.280> last

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
the end of this you would work your last

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.750 
the end of this you would work your last
two<00:04:17.970> stitches<00:04:19.130> by<00:04:20.130> netting<00:04:20.459> with<00:04:20.579> you

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
two stitches by netting with you

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.820 
two stitches by netting with you
together<00:04:20.940> pulling<00:04:21.810> your<00:04:21.989> tail<00:04:22.230> through<00:04:22.590> and

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
together pulling your tail through and

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:28.210 
together pulling your tail through and
cutting<00:04:23.220> your<00:04:23.990> and<00:04:25.580> to<00:04:26.580> weave<00:04:26.760> in<00:04:26.940> the<00:04:27.090> tail

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
cutting your and to weave in the tail

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:36.760 
cutting your and to weave in the tail
but<00:04:29.220> that<00:04:29.460> also<00:04:30.770> gives<00:04:31.770> you<00:04:31.860> a<00:04:31.889> flexible<00:04:32.669> edge

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.020 

a<00:04:38.740> third<00:04:39.740> way<00:04:39.979> that<00:04:40.190> you<00:04:40.280> can<00:04:40.490> work<00:04:40.669> to

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
a third way that you can work to

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.360 
a third way that you can work to
decrease<00:04:41.210> bind<00:04:41.690> off<00:04:41.900> is<00:04:42.110> by<00:04:42.289> purling<00:04:43.039> two

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
decrease bind off is by purling two

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.189 
decrease bind off is by purling two
stitches<00:04:43.940> together<00:04:45.940> so<00:04:46.940> you<00:04:47.030> just<00:04:47.210> purl<00:04:47.780> two

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:48.199 
stitches together so you just purl two

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:51.850 
stitches together so you just purl two
together

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.160 

and<00:04:52.370> then<00:04:52.580> that<00:04:52.730> stitch<00:04:53.120> goes<00:04:53.450> back<00:04:53.810> to<00:04:54.080> the

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.170 
and then that stitch goes back to the

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
and then that stitch goes back to the
left<00:04:54.410> needle<00:04:55.750> just<00:04:56.750> like<00:04:57.590> the<00:04:57.740> other<00:04:57.890> two

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
left needle just like the other two

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:14.309 
left needle just like the other two
methods<00:04:58.520> that<00:04:58.850> I<00:04:59.060> showed<00:04:59.300> you

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:14.319 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:16.379 

so<00:05:14.800> you<00:05:14.949> can<00:05:15.099> use<00:05:15.249> the<00:05:15.430> decrease<00:05:15.849> bind<00:05:16.149> off

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:16.389 
so you can use the decrease bind off

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:19.619 
so you can use the decrease bind off
anywhere<00:05:16.899> that<00:05:17.110> you<00:05:17.229> need<00:05:17.259> a<00:05:18.330> flexible<00:05:19.330> edge

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:19.629 
anywhere that you need a flexible edge

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:25.409 
anywhere that you need a flexible edge
like<00:05:20.169> maybe<00:05:20.409> on<00:05:20.649> toe<00:05:21.249> up<00:05:21.460> socks<00:05:23.849> or<00:05:24.849> around<00:05:25.210> the

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
like maybe on toe up socks or around the

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:36.899 
like maybe on toe up socks or around the
neckline<00:05:25.659> of<00:05:26.169> a<00:05:26.379> sweater<00:05:33.839> and<00:05:34.839> of<00:05:35.020> course<00:05:35.909> with

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:36.909 
neckline of a sweater and of course with

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:39.749 
neckline of a sweater and of course with
the<00:05:37.149> purl<00:05:37.419> method<00:05:37.930> you<00:05:38.110> would<00:05:38.259> just<00:05:38.490> purl<00:05:39.490> your

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:39.759 
the purl method you would just purl your

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:42.389 
the purl method you would just purl your
last<00:05:39.939> two<00:05:40.419> stitches<00:05:41.050> together<00:05:41.259> cut<00:05:41.860> your<00:05:42.009> tail

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:42.399 
last two stitches together cut your tail

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:51.290 
last two stitches together cut your tail
and<00:05:43.349> leave<00:05:44.349> in<00:05:44.529> your<00:05:44.710> end

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.850 

another<00:05:52.300> nice<00:05:53.490> flexible<00:05:54.490> edge<00:05:54.759> here<00:05:55.860> let's

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
another nice flexible edge here let's

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.300 
another nice flexible edge here let's
decrease<00:05:57.339> bind<00:05:57.639> off<00:05:57.819> three<00:05:58.119> ways
