being serious so open it up you got

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.820 
being serious so open it up you got
another<00:03:14.760> small<00:03:15.060> PCB<00:03:15.390> in<00:03:15.600> there<00:03:15.780> dumont<00:03:16.470> it<00:03:16.560> the

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
another small PCB in there dumont it the

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.140 
another small PCB in there dumont it the
only<00:03:17.040> thing<00:03:17.190> different<00:03:17.400> about<00:03:17.520> the<00:03:17.700> PCB<00:03:18.090> is

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
only thing different about the PCB is

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.230 
only thing different about the PCB is
almost<00:03:18.570> exactly<00:03:18.720> same<00:03:19.290> as<00:03:19.320> a<00:03:19.470> tes<00:03:20.120> like<00:03:21.120> the

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
almost exactly same as a tes like the

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.120 
almost exactly same as a tes like the
Chumley's<00:03:21.630> taken<00:03:22.050> the<00:03:22.140> smaller<00:03:22.440> imola<00:03:22.950> the

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
Chumley's taken the smaller imola the

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.800 
Chumley's taken the smaller imola the
other<00:03:23.280> tes<00:03:23.820> tix<00:03:24.030> with<00:03:24.180> no<00:03:24.270> sighs<00:03:24.510> you<00:03:24.720> know

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
other tes tix with no sighs you know

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.390 
other tes tix with no sighs you know
smaller<00:03:25.140> tease<00:03:25.320> I'll<00:03:25.920> probably<00:03:26.100> put<00:03:26.340> a

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
smaller tease I'll probably put a

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.699 
smaller tease I'll probably put a
picture<00:03:26.610> up<00:03:26.850> is<00:03:27.600> that<00:03:27.870> when<00:03:28.170> you<00:03:28.260> plug<00:03:28.440> into<00:03:28.620> a

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
picture up is that when you plug into a

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.130 
picture up is that when you plug into a
PC<00:03:29.100> it<00:03:29.280> says<00:03:29.490> fight<00:03:29.910> stick<00:03:30.180> Neal<00:03:30.450> so<00:03:30.870> it<00:03:30.959> must

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
PC it says fight stick Neal so it must

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.740 
PC it says fight stick Neal so it must
be<00:03:31.200> better<00:03:31.440> right<00:03:31.740> not<00:03:32.430> really<00:03:32.790> it<00:03:33.510> seems

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
be better right not really it seems

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.229 
be better right not really it seems
exactly<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.200> same<00:03:34.410> I<00:03:34.980> don't<00:03:35.489> know<00:03:35.550> is<00:03:35.730> easy<00:03:36.150> to

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
exactly the same I don't know is easy to

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:37.550 
exactly the same I don't know is easy to
do<00:03:36.360> them<00:03:36.480> on<00:03:36.630> so<00:03:36.810> I'm<00:03:36.870> happy<00:03:37.019> about<00:03:37.200> that<00:03:37.440> this

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
do them on so I'm happy about that this

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.050 
do them on so I'm happy about that this
actually<00:03:37.739> works<00:03:38.010> on<00:03:38.130> both<00:03:38.160> systems<00:03:38.519> so<00:03:38.910> that's

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
actually works on both systems so that's

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.420 
actually works on both systems so that's
good<00:03:39.269> news<00:03:39.450> that's<00:03:39.810> actually<00:03:40.260> a<00:03:40.320> plus<00:03:40.560> I'm

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
good news that's actually a plus I'm

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.300 
good news that's actually a plus I'm
putting<00:03:41.760> things<00:03:41.940> there<00:03:42.150> oh<00:03:43.040> but<00:03:44.040> in<00:03:44.130> general

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
putting things there oh but in general

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.460 
putting things there oh but in general
let's<00:03:44.910> actually<00:03:45.239> get<00:03:45.480> to<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.750> price<00:03:46.170> point<00:03:46.350> of

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
let's actually get to the price point of

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.100 
let's actually get to the price point of
stick<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:46.980> stick<00:03:47.220> is<00:03:47.370> solid<00:03:47.790> right<00:03:48.110> good

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
stick the stick is solid right good

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.440 
stick the stick is solid right good
stick<00:03:49.440> these<00:03:50.250> are<00:03:50.430> half<00:03:50.640> is<00:03:50.820> actually<00:03:51.239> lighter

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
stick these are half is actually lighter

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.090 
stick these are half is actually lighter
than<00:03:51.600> the<00:03:51.690> T<00:03:51.870> which<00:03:52.140> is<00:03:52.170> not<00:03:52.470> a<00:03:52.500> plus<00:03:52.769> for<00:03:52.920> me<00:03:52.980> I

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
than the T which is not a plus for me I

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.280 
than the T which is not a plus for me I
don't<00:03:53.790> you<00:03:54.120> know<00:03:54.150> we<00:03:54.720> don't<00:03:54.810> want<00:03:54.989> to<00:03:55.080> stick

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
don't you know we don't want to stick

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.840 
don't you know we don't want to stick
move<00:03:55.440> around<00:03:55.680> when<00:03:55.830> it's<00:03:55.980> on<00:03:56.070> your<00:03:56.220> lap<00:03:56.370> it's

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
move around when it's on your lap it's

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.790 
move around when it's on your lap it's
actually<00:03:57.300> real<00:03:57.690> negative<00:03:57.900> I'm<00:03:58.260> surprising<00:03:58.739> to

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
actually real negative I'm surprising to

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.220 
actually real negative I'm surprising to
put<00:03:58.950> know<00:03:59.070> my<00:03:59.850> you<00:04:00.150> know<00:04:00.269> I'm<00:04:00.510> form-fitting

PDP<00:04:04.830> I'm<00:04:05.130> te<00:04:05.340> 6<00:04:05.730> this<00:04:05.970> actually<00:04:06.150> I<00:04:06.330> thought<00:04:06.510> it

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
PDP I'm te 6 this actually I thought it

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.570 
PDP I'm te 6 this actually I thought it
was<00:04:06.630> the<00:04:06.750> next<00:04:06.900> revision<00:04:07.200> but<00:04:07.530> it<00:04:08.220> seems<00:04:08.430> like

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
was the next revision but it seems like

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.610 
was the next revision but it seems like
it's<00:04:08.820> just<00:04:09.060> to<00:04:09.209> you<00:04:10.080> know<00:04:10.110> quench<00:04:10.470> the<00:04:10.590> thirst

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
it's just to you know quench the thirst

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.610 
it's just to you know quench the thirst
of<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.040> hungry<00:04:11.700> hungry<00:04:12.150> hungry<00:04:12.690> stick<00:04:13.260> lovers

of the hungry hungry hungry stick lovers

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.620 
of the hungry hungry hungry stick lovers
like<00:04:13.739> me<00:04:13.920> while<00:04:14.160> that<00:04:14.340> sounds<00:04:14.459> weird<00:04:14.700> but<00:04:15.030> yeah

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
like me while that sounds weird but yeah

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.240 
like me while that sounds weird but yeah
like<00:04:15.959> we<00:04:16.229> would<00:04:16.320> bother<00:04:16.500> mark<00:04:16.859> may<00:04:17.010> they

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
like we would bother mark may they

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.789 
like we would bother mark may they
released<00:04:17.609> a<00:04:17.700> thousand<00:04:18.180> i<00:04:18.510> bought<00:04:18.930> it<00:04:19.049> in<00:04:19.140> if

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
released a thousand i bought it in if

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.469 
released a thousand i bought it in if
you're<00:04:20.310> not<00:04:20.400> stick<00:04:20.700> collected<00:04:21.150> you<00:04:21.269> should

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
you're not stick collected you should

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.990 
you're not stick collected you should
probably<00:04:21.780> stray<00:04:22.440> away<00:04:22.620> and<00:04:23.010> I<00:04:23.490> can<00:04:23.700> see<00:04:23.850> why

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
probably stray away and I can see why

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.730 
probably stray away and I can see why
the<00:04:24.060> marketing<00:04:24.540> push<00:04:24.690> ISM<00:04:24.990> is<00:04:25.110> so<00:04:25.229> strong<00:04:25.530> on

the marketing push ISM is so strong on

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.350 
the marketing push ISM is so strong on
the<00:04:25.830> stick<00:04:26.040> because<00:04:26.400> they<00:04:26.610> feel<00:04:26.880> the<00:04:27.000> same<00:04:27.210> way

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.940 
negatives compared to original T the
original<00:04:35.580> team

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
original team

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.180 
original team
te<00:04:36.340> has<00:04:36.640> more<00:04:36.970> it's<00:04:37.900> actually<00:04:38.050> a<00:04:38.320> lot<00:04:38.770> not<00:04:39.160> a

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
te has more it's actually a lot not a

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.470 
te has more it's actually a lot not a
lot<00:04:39.310> heavier<00:04:39.550> stick<00:04:39.850> but<00:04:39.970> these<00:04:40.090> are<00:04:40.210> heavier

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
lot heavier stick but these are heavier

cheaper<00:05:09.600> if<00:05:10.600> for<00:05:10.960> the<00:05:11.020> fact<00:05:11.230> this<00:05:11.470> is

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
cheaper if for the fact this is

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.830
