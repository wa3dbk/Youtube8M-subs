00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:06.810
 Hello everyone and now I want to show you 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:11.849
 very cool shaders for mycraft 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.429
 Pocket edishn so well, and the cat is all 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.230
 It looks like a case 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:20.609
 the sand is generally crazy even at night here 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.800
 Now we have to glow on the water 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.140
 the waves 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:28.170
 so here you can see them and Diana and 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.119
 like foliage of the horns and we stand but just 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.239
 we turn our heads 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:40.339
 only when we go is it all noticeable 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:45.690
 also we are the same weed only weed 

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:50.300
 also dancing like that later 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:55.160
 all good water in her all kind 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.640
 on yes and under it too ok well 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.550
 these here 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.140
 shadows they should already disappear because 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:08.110
 there is no sun but they still remain 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:14.390
 I do not know why this is where we have here 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:14.780
 where the moon is there the sun and the moon where there is clearly no 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.250
 the moon 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:24.110
 but I have to lose in normal 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:28.030
 in a regular game and it will come out because 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:34.280
 then what kind of crap and the torch stands there exactly 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:38.360
 how here we have here a torch and so here 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.789
 me tank is going on the whole chang perry fig 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.420
 for this we just need 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:46.520
 collapse and expand our block launcher 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.380
 it is put as regular textures though 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.530
 this is the usual textures on just 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.170
 modified as well they are based on 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.470
 faint cool 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.940
 32 by 32 but everything looks like we have a sword 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.319
 such as an ordinary sword and but here 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:08.509
 there is such a pretty torch here we 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:11.810
 We set and he at us Verkhovsky simply not 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.220
 replaced icons and everything is also this bug 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.980
 for example, here we are right here at 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:20.720
 break so 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:24.230
 here we put the torch to the torch and everything is well 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.840
 instead of so interesting to us if 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.700
 I was just yes and the block means we set 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.140
 normal block like this either like this 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:35.420
 here we go we go and we all 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.660
 reload and everything works as well 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.090
 we have here at least I know 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:45.319
 who shoots with these shaders and he 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:48.019
 everything is okay even lat's play saws so we 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.410
 Here such here sometimes happens not at me 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:54.680
 progruzhat well, in general, here are 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:57.140
 cultures are pretty good but everyone 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.410

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:07.069
 leave in the description and here we are not 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:10.280
 I remember that it was so generally set 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:14.140

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:17.599
