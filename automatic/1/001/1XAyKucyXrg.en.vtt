the game plays I come on yeah I'm saying
it<00:01:40.110> could<00:01:40.229> be<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.350> little<00:01:40.590> more<00:01:40.740> fluid<00:01:41.159> controls

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
it could be a little more fluid controls

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.200 
it could be a little more fluid controls
enormous<00:01:42.509> earn<00:01:42.689> shit<00:01:43.409> like<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:44.090> now<00:01:45.090> with

enormous earn shit like that now with
that<00:01:45.240> being<00:01:45.390> said<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.840> think<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.500> that's

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
that being said I think that that's

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.859 
that being said I think that that's
another<00:01:47.430> reason<00:01:47.729> that's<00:01:48.329> another<00:01:48.630> reason

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
another reason that's another reason

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.170 
another reason that's another reason

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
found that modern warfare two played his

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.130 
found that modern warfare two played his
best<00:02:37.900> when<00:02:38.650> I<00:02:38.740> played<00:02:39.040> on<00:02:39.510> when<00:02:40.510> I<00:02:40.600> play<00:02:40.810> a<00:02:40.840> game

modern<00:02:51.070> warfare<00:02:51.310> 2<00:02:51.730> is<00:02:51.880> Ravi<00:02:52.330> person<00:02:52.810> but<00:02:53.560> uh

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.370 

well<00:02:58.120> yeah<00:02:58.239> like<00:02:58.360> I<00:02:58.510> was<00:02:58.540> saying<00:02:58.660> though<00:02:58.959> but

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
well yeah like I was saying though but

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.530 
well yeah like I was saying though but
but<00:03:00.280> that's<00:03:00.489> the<00:03:00.670> reason<00:03:01.030> know<00:03:01.120> that<00:03:01.300> i<00:03:01.330> was

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
but that's the reason know that i was

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.600 
but that's the reason know that i was
thinking<00:03:01.600> that<00:03:02.140> you<00:03:02.709> know<00:03:02.770> black<00:03:03.130> ops<00:03:03.370> should

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
thinking that you know black ops should

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.060 
thinking that you know black ops should
be<00:03:03.760> better<00:03:03.940> because<00:03:04.120> one<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:05.320> system<00:03:05.830> should

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
be better because one the system should

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.550 
be better because one the system should
be<00:03:06.130> running<00:03:06.550> as<00:03:07.120> high<00:03:07.390> performance<00:03:08.020> as<00:03:08.200> far<00:03:08.440> as

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
be running as high performance as far as

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.380 
be running as high performance as far as
worrying<00:03:08.920> about<00:03:09.040> putting<00:03:09.580> out<00:03:09.670> good<00:03:09.880> graphic

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
worrying about putting out good graphic

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.870 
worrying about putting out good graphic
so<00:03:10.660> it<00:03:11.440> should<00:03:11.680> be<00:03:11.709> able<00:03:11.950> to<00:03:12.100> deliver<00:03:12.430> a<00:03:12.610> better

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
so it should be able to deliver a better

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.750 
so it should be able to deliver a better
connection<00:03:13.709> more<00:03:14.709> smoother<00:03:15.160> game<00:03:15.370> you<00:03:15.670> know

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
connection more smoother game you know

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.420 
connection more smoother game you know
