00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
really well ok so sup wat some features

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.460 
really well ok so sup wat some features
were<00:02:12.480> quickly<00:02:12.720> that

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
were quickly that

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.990 
were quickly that
from<00:02:13.590> two<00:02:13.710> 10<00:02:13.980> millimeter<00:02:14.010> titanium<00:02:14.790> driver

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
from two 10 millimeter titanium driver

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.700 
from two 10 millimeter titanium driver
like<00:02:15.180> I<00:02:15.300> said<00:02:15.540> that<00:02:16.110> really<00:02:16.320> helps<00:02:16.590> with<00:02:16.650> the

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
like I said that really helps with the

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.080 
like I said that really helps with the
low<00:02:16.890> base<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.370> power<00:02:17.610> that<00:02:17.670> these<00:02:17.910> do

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
low base and the power that these do

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.640 
low base and the power that these do
deliver<00:02:18.390> you<00:02:18.870> have<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.140> twenty<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:19.440> twenty

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
deliver you have the twenty and twenty

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.770 
deliver you have the twenty and twenty
thousand<00:02:20.010> frequency<00:02:20.400> range<00:02:20.640> you<00:02:21.330> also<00:02:21.480> have

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
thousand frequency range you also have

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.950 
thousand frequency range you also have
an<00:02:21.870> efficiency<00:02:22.290> decibels<00:02:22.800> of<00:02:22.890> 166<00:02:23.700> so<00:02:24.600> what

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
an efficiency decibels of 166 so what

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.300 
an efficiency decibels of 166 so what
else<00:02:25.110> is<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.470> headphones<00:02:25.830> have<00:02:25.980> you<00:02:26.130> have<00:02:26.220> the

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
gold plated plug 1.2 meters in length

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.590 
gold plated plug 1.2 meters in length
and<00:02:28.650> also<00:02:29.280> great<00:02:29.610> comfort<00:02:30.000> I<00:02:30.150> do<00:02:30.210> love<00:02:30.510> the

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
sound and you go into the highs I mean

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.140 
sound and you go into the highs I mean
these<00:03:04.770> aren't<00:03:05.010> couple<00:03:05.760> hundred<00:03:06.000> dollar

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
these aren't couple hundred dollar

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.060 
these aren't couple hundred dollar
headphones<00:03:06.630> are<00:03:06.840> not<00:03:06.990> going<00:03:07.170> to<00:03:07.290> have<00:03:07.920> the

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
headphones are not going to have the

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.949 
headphones are not going to have the
greatest<00:03:08.310> highs<00:03:08.580> but<00:03:08.790> it's<00:03:08.970> actually<00:03:09.180> it's
