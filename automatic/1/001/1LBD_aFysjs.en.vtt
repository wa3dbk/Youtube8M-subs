00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:11.769
 [Music] 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.650
 this Thursday, April 17, 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.550
 2014 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.420
 nasa has officially announced the 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.710
 discovery of the first planet 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:31.650
 potentially habitable the planet is 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.030
 keppler flame 86 efe 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:39.210
 is part of the kepler-11 system 86 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:42.120
 located in the Cygnus constellation the 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.739
 planet is almost the same size as the 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:50.219
 land surrounded only 10% larger than 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.550
 our planet is also more 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.360
 near its star having a year in 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.859
 who wants to read very well to eff about 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.160
 130 Earth days 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.680
 but this is not a problem since 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.070
 class stars in red are more 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.939
 and therefore the habitable zone is 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:16.080
 closest to the star or either 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:18.479
 black 86 fmi is in the habitable zone that 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.630
 means that the planet is not even 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.880
 far from his star to the point of 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.400
 be too cold to keep water 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.430
 and an atmosphere conducive to 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.040
 life and not too close to the point 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:37.680
 that radiation and heat can 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:40.530
 86 excessively hot planet EFE 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:44.220
 is the fifth of your system is there 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.490
 500 light years from Earth 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.270
 the star wants very half is one in 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.119
 red 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.479
 this type of star is even very 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:58.259
 common in the milky way representing about 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.090
 of 70% of all stars found 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.340
 in our galaxy 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.960
 another important detail is that 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.420
 lose 1 86 efe 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.149
 is also far enough away from the 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.970
 star not to suffer a lock 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.650
 what would the planet do 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.439
 turn this way 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.519
 which would always show the same face to the 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:20.939
 star 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:25.260
 ie have the next day would be forever 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:28.909
 in another eternally night like the 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.319
 which occurs with our moon if the planet 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:34.620
 I was really in this race 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.030
 gravitational potential could still have 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.310
 to shelter life 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.799
 the atmosphere would take care of 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.760
 carry the heat of the illuminated region 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:46.489
 to the dark region and the dark region 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.180
 the heat of the region called 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:51.409
 sending cold 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:56.250
 even so the chances of harboring life 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:03:00.030
 would be reduced but fortunately this did not 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:03.299
 This is the case of quepe 186 efe 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:06.090
 The great challenge now is to study more 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:08.569
 this planet since even with 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.629
 state-of-the-art space telescopes 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:16.650
 it is very difficult to have more information from 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:19.949
 than those already collected on pepe et etf 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:23.010
 but the star has a very low brightness 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:26.430
 summing up the discovery the planet has 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:31.250
 everything to be identical to the earth with sky 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:36.389
 blue earth water net drinking water oceans 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:38.819
 animals and intelligent beings 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:42.449
 for now it also becomes impossible 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:45.900
 send a mission there even if it does not 

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:47.190
 manned by the gigantic distance 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.680
 involved 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:54.419
 to get a sense of the speed of 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:56.940
 light is the fastest in the universe does not have 

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:59.790
 how to be outdated 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.129
 even if we had the technology to 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:06.150
 sending a mission traveling at speed 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:09.599
 of light to keppler 186 ef 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.650
 it would take us about 500 years to arrive 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:13.349
 there 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:17.159
 counting on the luck that nothing of 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:21.630
 the way it would take another 500 

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:22.620
 years to come back and bring the result of 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:27.450
 search 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:29.940
 and even sending information from there 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:33.720
 earth as with probes that 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:36.780
 on Mars would be impossible since 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.570
 each information would have to travel through a 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:43.020
 long time without receiving any 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:46.110
 interference during your journey but 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.780
 discovery is already a great achievement and is the 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.780
 the beginning of the realization of something 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.710
 all of us who like ecology already 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.310
 we know 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:59.490
 we are not alone in the universe 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:03.060
 and we hope that in a few years we can 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:05.940
 even if from here on earth confirm this 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:09.420
 information and that in a future who knows 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:13.160
 go there and make personal contact 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:15.930
 with another civilization being this time 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:20.030
 we the aliens 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:23.040
 And you, what do you think, do not stop commenting. 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:25.590
