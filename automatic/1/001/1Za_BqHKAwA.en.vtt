is<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.559> verbal<00:00:53.460> sets<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.289> we<00:00:55.289> gonna<00:00:55.530> use<00:00:56.100> the

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
is the verbal sets and we gonna use the

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.170 
is the verbal sets and we gonna use the
times<00:00:57.090> if<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:58.109> have<00:00:58.289> seen<00:00:58.620> my<00:00:58.890> previous

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
times if you have seen my previous

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.420 
times if you have seen my previous
tutorials<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.809> know<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.410> global<00:01:01.680> variables

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
tutorials you know the global variables

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.560 
tutorials you know the global variables
x<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.780> dates<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:05.339> time<00:01:05.700> inside

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
x is the dates and the time inside

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.760 
x is the dates and the time inside
seconds<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:08.010> we<00:01:08.310> gonna<00:01:08.520> put<00:01:08.880> all<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.780> inside

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
seconds so we gonna put all that inside

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.660 
seconds so we gonna put all that inside
a<00:01:11.040> new<00:01:11.490> variable<00:01:12.180> start<00:01:13.110> sleep<00:01:13.770> that's<00:01:14.340> what

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
a new variable start sleep that's what

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.960 
a new variable start sleep that's what
we<00:01:14.850> are<00:01:14.880> doing<00:01:15.049> when<00:01:16.049> we<00:01:16.080> go<00:01:16.439> into<00:01:16.650> sleep<00:01:17.189> okay

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
we are doing when we go into sleep okay

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
to know how long we have slept so we

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.740 
to know how long we have slept so we
perform<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.900> task<00:01:25.229> called<00:01:25.920> time<00:01:26.549> slept<00:01:27.060> let<00:01:27.570> me

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
perform a task called time slept let me

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.410 
perform a task called time slept let me
open<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:29.189> will<00:01:29.400> see<00:01:29.610> here<00:01:29.970> several

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
open that and you will see here several

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.490 
open that and you will see here several
things<00:01:30.930> first<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.770> all<00:01:31.979> let's<00:01:32.520> play<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:36.140> and<00:01:37.140> it

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
things first of all let's play it and it

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.149 
things first of all let's play it and it
says<00:01:37.829> we<00:01:38.610> have<00:01:38.939> slept<00:01:39.270> nine<00:01:39.689> hours<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.439> 19

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
says we have slept nine hours and 19

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.880 
says we have slept nine hours and 19
minutes<00:01:41.540> the<00:01:42.540> first<00:01:42.810> thing<00:01:43.140> we're<00:01:43.350> gonna<00:01:43.560> do

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
minutes the first thing we're gonna do

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.870 
minutes the first thing we're gonna do
is<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.579> variable<00:01:45.210> sex<00:01:45.540> stop<00:01:46.229> sleep<00:01:46.619> two<00:01:47.189> times

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
is a variable sex stop sleep two times

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.960 
is a variable sex stop sleep two times
so<00:01:48.450> we're<00:01:48.840> putting<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.290> times<00:01:50.009> right<00:01:50.700> now

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
so we're putting the times right now

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.219 
so we're putting the times right now
inside<00:01:51.689> stop<00:01:52.470> sleep<00:01:52.799> it's<00:01:53.250> quite<00:01:53.520> easy<00:01:53.820> and

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
inside stop sleep it's quite easy and

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.800 
inside stop sleep it's quite easy and
then<00:01:55.229> we're<00:01:55.680> gonna<00:01:55.920> do<00:01:56.250> some<00:01:56.280> math<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:57.329> we're

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
then we're gonna do some math so we're

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.800 
then we're gonna do some math so we're
gonna<00:01:58.079> do<00:01:58.350> also<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:59.100> variable<00:01:59.490> set<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.180> we

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
gonna do also a variable set and we

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.280 
gonna do also a variable set and we
gonna<00:02:01.110> create<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.950> new<00:02:02.430> verbal<00:02:03.210> time<00:02:03.659> sleep<00:02:04.079> and

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
gonna create a new verbal time sleep and

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.330 
gonna create a new verbal time sleep and
time<00:02:04.770> sleep<00:02:05.130> will<00:02:05.700> be<00:02:05.939> stopped<00:02:06.479> sleep<00:02:06.810> -<00:02:07.680> start

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
time sleep will be stopped sleep - start

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.979 
time sleep will be stopped sleep - start
sleep<00:02:09.060> divided<00:02:09.959> by<00:02:11.120> 3600<00:02:12.120> we're<00:02:12.300> gonna<00:02:12.540> divide

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
sleep divided by 3600 we're gonna divide

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.280 
sleep divided by 3600 we're gonna divide
that<00:02:13.230> by

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
that by

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.560 
that by
3,600<00:02:15.290> because<00:02:15.740> we<00:02:16.100> want<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.820> result<00:02:17.300> in

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
3,600 because we want the result in

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.360 
3,600 because we want the result in
hours<00:02:18.380> and<00:02:18.590> minutes<00:02:18.940> so<00:02:19.940> we're<00:02:20.390> gonna<00:02:20.570> do

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
hours and minutes so we're gonna do

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.190 
hours and minutes so we're gonna do
3,600<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:22.490> of<00:02:22.850> course<00:02:23.150> when<00:02:23.570> we<00:02:23.750> divide

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
3,600 and of course when we divide

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.910 
3,600 and of course when we divide
something<00:02:24.800> we<00:02:25.490> have<00:02:25.970> to<00:02:26.240> do<00:02:26.450> maths<00:02:27.050> of<00:02:27.350> course

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
something we have to do maths of course

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.580 
something we have to do maths of course
that's<00:02:28.490> quite<00:02:28.850> easy<00:02:29.150> let's<00:02:29.630> go<00:02:29.810> back<00:02:30.050> and<00:02:30.290> then

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
that's quite easy let's go back and then

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.820 
that's quite easy let's go back and then
I'm<00:02:30.890> using<00:02:31.060> flash<00:02:32.060> time<00:02:32.600> sleep<00:02:33.170> I'm<00:02:33.560> using

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
I'm using flash time sleep I'm using

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.540 
I'm using flash time sleep I'm using
this<00:02:34.190> only<00:02:34.490> for<00:02:35.300> showing<00:02:36.080> you<00:02:36.290> what<00:02:36.980> the

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
this only for showing you what the

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.270 
this only for showing you what the
result<00:02:38.000> is<00:02:38.270> so<00:02:39.050> you<00:02:39.110> could<00:02:39.440> follow<00:02:39.680> what's

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
result is so you could follow what's

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.580 
result is so you could follow what's
happening<00:02:40.850> right<00:02:41.150> now<00:02:41.210> after<00:02:41.690> that<00:02:42.230> I<00:02:42.470> will

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
happening right now after that I will

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.820 
happening right now after that I will
delete<00:02:43.160> or<00:02:43.490> disable<00:02:44.000> that<00:02:44.630> action<00:02:45.200> so<00:02:45.500> while

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
delete or disable that action so while

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.600 
delete or disable that action so while
we<00:02:46.010> play<00:02:46.250> that<00:02:46.490> again<00:02:46.730> let's<00:02:47.450> play<00:02:47.840> that<00:02:48.170> and

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
we play that again let's play that and

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:56.580 
we play that again let's play that and
watch<00:02:49.610> to<00:02:50.090> the<00:02:50.300> number<00:02:50.840> inside<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:52.070> flesh

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.010 

thank<00:02:57.590> you<00:02:57.830> so<00:02:58.100> in<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.490> flesh<00:02:58.790> nine<00:02:59.420> point

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
thank you so in the flesh nine point

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.350 
thank you so in the flesh nine point
three<00:03:00.350> six<00:03:01.190> six<00:03:01.820> okay<00:03:02.540> so<00:03:03.470> we<00:03:03.980> have<00:03:04.340> to<00:03:04.700> split

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
three six six okay so we have to split

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.500 
three six six okay so we have to split
the<00:03:05.930> verbal<00:03:06.500> time<00:03:06.950> sleep<00:03:07.340> with<00:03:07.940> a<00:03:08.120> splitter

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
the verbal time sleep with a splitter

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.890 
the verbal time sleep with a splitter
points<00:03:09.440> and<00:03:09.650> the<00:03:10.400> numbers<00:03:10.820> before<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:11.420> points

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
points and the numbers before the points

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.280 
points and the numbers before the points
are<00:03:12.080> our<00:03:12.620> hours<00:03:13.490> so<00:03:14.060> we're<00:03:14.390> gonna<00:03:14.600> set<00:03:15.020> a

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
are our hours so we're gonna set a

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.340 
are our hours so we're gonna set a
variable<00:03:15.620> sets<00:03:16.070> oversleep<00:03:17.060> to<00:03:17.420> time<00:03:17.840> sleep

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
variable sets oversleep to time sleep

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.280 
variable sets oversleep to time sleep
one<00:03:18.830> the<00:03:19.100> first<00:03:19.310> part<00:03:19.700> of<00:03:19.970> that<00:03:20.480> then<00:03:20.960> the

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
one the first part of that then the

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.540 
one the first part of that then the
second<00:03:21.740> part<00:03:22.070> we<00:03:22.520> gonna<00:03:22.730> convert<00:03:23.390> that<00:03:23.690> to<00:03:24.140> our

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
second part we gonna convert that to our

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.300 
second part we gonna convert that to our
numbers<00:03:25.550> so<00:03:25.580> we're<00:03:26.330> gonna<00:03:26.570> to<00:03:27.020> time<00:03:27.590> sleep<00:03:27.980> to

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
numbers so we're gonna to time sleep to

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.500 
numbers so we're gonna to time sleep to
the<00:03:28.610> numbers<00:03:29.240> after<00:03:29.480> the<00:03:30.140> point<00:03:30.530> two<00:03:31.130> zero

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
the numbers after the point two zero

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.860 
the numbers after the point two zero
point<00:03:32.510> and<00:03:32.750> then<00:03:33.290> those<00:03:33.890> numbers<00:03:34.280> so<00:03:35.060> remember

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
point and then those numbers so remember

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.550 
point and then those numbers so remember
our<00:03:36.080> number<00:03:36.890> was<00:03:37.310> nine<00:03:37.970> point<00:03:38.480> three<00:03:38.630> six<00:03:39.260> six

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
our number was nine point three six six

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.910 
our number was nine point three six six
that<00:03:40.190> was<00:03:40.520> our<00:03:40.820> number<00:03:41.240> so<00:03:41.900> in<00:03:42.320> this<00:03:42.590> case

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
that was our number so in this case

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.910 
that was our number so in this case
we're<00:03:43.520> gonna<00:03:43.730> put<00:03:44.060> three<00:03:44.390> six<00:03:44.810> six<00:03:45.110> two<00:03:45.590> zero

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
we're gonna put three six six two zero

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.880 
we're gonna put three six six two zero
point<00:03:46.670> three<00:03:47.180> six<00:03:47.600> six<00:03:47.840> that's<00:03:48.470> what's

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
point three six six that's what's

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:49.990 
point three six six that's what's
happening<00:03:49.430> here

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
happening here

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.200 
happening here
inside<00:03:50.540> action<00:03:51.230> number<00:03:51.560> six<00:03:51.920> and<00:03:52.220> then<00:03:52.670> we're

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:53.210 
inside action number six and then we're

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.720 
inside action number six and then we're
gonna<00:03:53.510> do<00:03:53.930> action<00:03:54.500> number<00:03:54.800> seven<00:03:55.280> we're<00:03:55.520> gonna

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
gonna do action number seven we're gonna

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.410 
gonna do action number seven we're gonna
do<00:03:56.060> that's<00:03:56.480> times<00:03:57.130> 60<00:03:58.130> times<00:03:58.310> 60

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
do that's times 60 times 60

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:06.100 
do that's times 60 times 60
okay<00:04:00.080> so<00:04:00.620> we<00:04:01.220> have<00:04:03.040> 21.96<00:04:04.040> and<00:04:04.760> as<00:04:05.240> we<00:04:05.660> see<00:04:05.900> the

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
okay so we have 21.96 and as we see the

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.940 
okay so we have 21.96 and as we see the
results<00:04:06.680> you<00:04:06.830> will<00:04:07.190> see<00:04:07.250> here<00:04:07.910> 22<00:04:08.540> minutes<00:04:08.960> so

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
results you will see here 22 minutes so

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.120 
results you will see here 22 minutes so
we<00:04:10.190> gonna<00:04:10.430> around<00:04:11.030> that<00:04:11.600> number<00:04:12.290> and<00:04:12.500> for<00:04:12.920> that

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
we gonna around that number and for that

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.780 
we gonna around that number and for that
case<00:04:13.460> we<00:04:13.850> can<00:04:14.060> in<00:04:14.210> use<00:04:14.540> the<00:04:15.110> method<00:04:15.530> rounds<00:04:16.310> so

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
case we can in use the method rounds so

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.560 
case we can in use the method rounds so
here<00:04:17.270> we<00:04:17.450> do<00:04:17.690> the<00:04:18.560> verbal<00:04:19.010> my<00:04:19.220> slim<00:04:19.580> to<00:04:19.970> around

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
here we do the verbal my slim to around

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.280 
here we do the verbal my slim to around
times<00:04:21.140> flip<00:04:21.470> two<00:04:21.770> times<00:04:22.360> 60<00:04:23.360> and<00:04:23.510> then<00:04:23.870> we<00:04:24.050> use

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
times flip two times 60 and then we use

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.200 
times flip two times 60 and then we use
say<00:04:24.740> commands<00:04:25.340> and<00:04:25.550> at<00:04:26.090> the<00:04:26.360> ends

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
say commands and at the ends

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.200 
say commands and at the ends
we<00:04:27.270> also<00:04:27.539> doing<00:04:28.289> an<00:04:28.530> otter<00:04:29.030> notification<00:04:30.030> and

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
we also doing an otter notification and

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.770 
we also doing an otter notification and
we<00:04:31.050> sound<00:04:31.380> that's<00:04:31.710> right<00:04:32.280> here<00:04:32.669> so<00:04:33.120> we<00:04:33.360> do<00:04:33.539> a

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
we sound that's right here so we do a

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.700 
we sound that's right here so we do a
title<00:04:34.080> time<00:04:35.280> and<00:04:35.669> our<00:04:36.360> text<00:04:36.810> is<00:04:37.169> you<00:04:37.410> have

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
title time and our text is you have

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.870 
title time and our text is you have
slept<00:04:38.460> in<00:04:38.940> our<00:04:39.120> sleep<00:04:39.660> hours<00:04:40.199> and<00:04:40.500> men<00:04:41.310> sleep

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
slept in our sleep hours and men sleep

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.010 
slept in our sleep hours and men sleep
variable<00:04:42.630> minutes<00:04:43.500> and<00:04:43.830> we<00:04:44.310> also<00:04:44.610> use<00:04:45.030> an<00:04:45.330> icon

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
variable minutes and we also use an icon

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.379 
variable minutes and we also use an icon
that's<00:04:46.229> the<00:04:46.440> only<00:04:46.650> thing<00:04:46.800> what<00:04:47.400> happens<00:04:47.880> there

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
that's the only thing what happens there

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.840 
that's the only thing what happens there
let's<00:04:48.660> go<00:04:48.870> back<00:04:49.050> so<00:04:49.440> that's<00:04:49.770> the<00:04:50.039> task<00:04:50.340> for

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
let's go back so that's the task for

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.689 
let's go back so that's the task for
retrieving<00:04:51.810> the<00:04:51.960> time<00:04:52.199> you<00:04:52.620> have<00:04:52.889> slept<00:04:53.220> and

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:53.699 
retrieving the time you have slept and

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:56.629 
retrieving the time you have slept and
then<00:04:54.000> our<00:04:54.300> weather<00:04:55.100> forecasts<00:04:56.100> the<00:04:56.400> weather

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
then our weather forecasts the weather

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.920 
then our weather forecasts the weather
forecast<00:04:57.389> is<00:04:57.690> quite<00:04:58.020> easy<00:04:58.410> we<00:04:59.130> use<00:04:59.520> an<00:04:59.930> HTTP

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
forecast is quite easy we use an HTTP
