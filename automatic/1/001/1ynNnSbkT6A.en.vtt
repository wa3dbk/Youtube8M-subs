00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 in this 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.330
 the nike mercurial shoes 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:11.760
 that exist in the market 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:14.040
 we are talking and we would be informing 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.849
 that there is no other model of 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:21.330
 recumbent line shoe only 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:24.420
 these two models do not exist and mercurial 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.939
 sneakers super fly nor does it 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.180
 all models happen to steam 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.279
 are shoes or the line or 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.630
 the reading in all colors and 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.550
 all your presentations 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.550
 this time we have the two models 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.630
 how 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.560
 little bit of sole for guys this art 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.000
 special 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.100
 are not differences that can help the 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.290
 potential, much less to a better 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.650
 performance are simply differences 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.650
 aesthetics 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.420
 state schemes between them by 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.180
 example the sole 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.750
 this is a law 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.750
 one of them 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.600
 that is a law and this is a virtue 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.420
 the difference 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.340
 the soil type is the same as the 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.340
 rubber but it just changes 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:30.410
 It is the symbol of anger 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.390
 Regarding the skin, the skin is 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.970
 exactly the same material 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.460
 synthetic yes but nevertheless the 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.130
 'glivec' certain difference for example 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.830
 in this part you have a booster or a 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.420
 silicone type detail as a common 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.610
 adhesive that they put on the shoe 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.979
 both on the bottom of the of the 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.130
 shoe as in the part near the 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.500
 lasso to the pins to the 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.560
 laces and also has a detail in 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.300
 this part that is fiberglass in 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.190
 the model of victories does not have it 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.110
 with which simply that is the only 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.310
 detail and then the combination of 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.940
 colors in the part 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.500
 as I repeat and this is a habit 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.090
 regarding the template template 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.880
 as by far they are not very 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.160
 similar 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.290
 that they are reinforced come padded 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:22.099
 both a victory and 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.099
 once 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.659
 and the only thing they have in common 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.640
 it's a different material in the likes a 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:31.799
 material a little more synthetic than 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.079
 would slip less and now it is vÃ­ctor and 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:36.989
 they are like dt the jail would see a lot 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:39.659
 a little more memory perspiration 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.030
 also that they can record what is it 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:45.300
 that you want so much flag name 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.610
 or if they want name number i 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.360
 but this video came out a bit chosen 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.090
 distinguish them 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.090
 those that exist of grace
