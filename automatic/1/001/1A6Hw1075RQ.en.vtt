kind of take it away and put like I
figured<00:00:28.320> she<00:00:28.410> was<00:00:28.500> gonna<00:00:28.590> have<00:00:28.710> some<00:00:28.859> pretty

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
figured she was gonna have some pretty

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.460 
figured she was gonna have some pretty
bad<00:00:29.189> hands<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:29.849> just<00:00:30.359> decided<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.750> for<00:00:31.289> bet

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
bad hands so I just decided to for bet

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.180 
bad hands so I just decided to for bet
38<00:00:31.980> K<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.510> she<00:00:33.510> takes<00:00:33.840> about<00:00:33.989> 20<00:00:34.350> seconds<00:00:34.829> she

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
38 K and she takes about 20 seconds she

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.700 
38 K and she takes about 20 seconds she
decides<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.520> call<00:00:35.730> so<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:37.050> kind<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.500> thought<00:00:37.649> she

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
decides to call so I kind of thought she

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.130 
decides to call so I kind of thought she
was<00:00:38.010> just<00:00:38.100> trying<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.550> take<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.600> away<00:00:39.660> pull<00:00:39.870> off

was just trying to take it away pull off

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.049 
was just trying to take it away pull off
from<00:00:40.350> me<00:00:40.469> because<00:00:41.010> she<00:00:41.489> has<00:00:41.579> all<00:00:41.700> these<00:00:41.790> chips

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
from me because she has all these chips

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.420 
from me because she has all these chips
and<00:00:42.270> didn't<00:00:43.079> really<00:00:43.230> believe<00:00:43.379> her<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:44.219> flop

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
and didn't really believe her the flop

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.270 
and didn't really believe her the flop
comes<00:00:44.670> six<00:00:45.000> six<00:00:45.210> seven<00:00:45.360> rainbow<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.469> bet<00:00:46.710> 28

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
comes six six seven rainbow and I bet 28

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.380

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
much thought and I just really didn't

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.270 
much thought and I just really didn't
think<00:00:54.420> she'd<00:00:54.600> play<00:00:54.780> picking<00:00:55.079> out<00:00:55.170> like<00:00:55.260> this<00:00:55.440> I
