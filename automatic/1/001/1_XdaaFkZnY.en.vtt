00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
all right here's the drawing mini-map

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.260 
all right here's the drawing mini-map
the<00:01:39.770> red<00:01:39.979> area<00:01:40.340> is<00:01:40.429> obviously<00:01:40.880> where<00:01:41.030> we're<00:01:41.240> at

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
the red area is obviously where we're at

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.740 
the red area is obviously where we're at
we're<00:01:41.689> in<00:01:42.579> to<00:01:43.579> call<00:01:43.729> the<00:01:43.850> helipad<00:01:44.270> building

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
we're in to call the helipad building

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.319 
we're in to call the helipad building
and<00:01:44.899> you<00:01:45.590> can<00:01:45.740> see<00:01:45.859> all<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:46.070> blue<00:01:46.399> dots<00:01:46.670> or<00:01:47.179> is

and you can see all the blue dots or is
where<00:01:47.479> the<00:01:47.570> enemies<00:01:47.869> that<00:01:47.960> you<00:01:48.109> got<00:01:48.229> to<00:01:48.259> worry

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:48.469 
where the enemies that you got to worry

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:51.489 
where the enemies that you got to worry
about<00:01:48.500> spawning<00:01:49.009> a<00:01:49.280> time<00:01:49.549> I<00:01:50.170> think<00:01:51.170> there<00:01:51.320> may

00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:51.499 
about spawning a time I think there may

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:54.279 
about spawning a time I think there may
be<00:01:51.530> a<00:01:51.649> spawn<00:01:51.979> as<00:01:52.219> well<00:01:52.640> on<00:01:53.030> the<00:01:53.420> other<00:01:53.450> side<00:01:54.020> of

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
be a spawn as well on the other side of

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:56.709 
be a spawn as well on the other side of
the<00:01:54.560> building<00:01:54.950> and<00:01:55.130> the<00:01:55.159> bottom<00:01:55.939> most<00:01:56.179> right

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 
the building and the bottom most right

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:59.080 
the building and the bottom most right
circle<00:01:57.200> they<00:01:57.799> did<00:01:57.979> a<00:01:58.009> little<00:01:58.189> L<00:01:58.490> building<00:01:58.999> is

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
circle they did a little L building is

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.730 
circle they did a little L building is
that<00:01:59.240> there's<00:01:59.479> a<00:01:59.570> spawn<00:02:00.229> right<00:02:00.469> on<00:02:00.619> the<00:02:00.710> other

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
that there's a spawn right on the other

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.380 
that there's a spawn right on the other
side<00:02:00.890> of<00:02:01.039> the<00:02:01.130> building<00:02:01.429> too<00:02:01.579> and<00:02:02.090> I'm<00:02:02.210> unsure

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
side of the building too and I'm unsure

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.690 
side of the building too and I'm unsure
about<00:02:02.749> that<00:02:03.049> one<00:02:03.229> but<00:02:03.890> I<00:02:04.009> know<00:02:04.039> for<00:02:04.369> certain<00:02:04.490> is

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
about that one but I know for certain is
