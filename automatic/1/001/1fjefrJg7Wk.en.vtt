00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.869
 Integrative medicine has been 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.309
 normalized in Brazil in 2006 in the 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:18.390
 albert einstein already has a department 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.730
 just for it alone and expensive and of course only 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.829
 the sus has also have some hospitals 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.579
 they are already applying what is the 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:25.649
 what 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:27.840
 besides the remedy besides the treatments that 

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:29.369
 We already know the treatments. 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.130
 of the doctor 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.590
 besides these treatments have the 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.300
 alternative complementary treatments 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:42.420
 and Chinese medicines where ana or 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.980
 they make a combo everything they have 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.100
 willingness and willingness of psychiatrists to 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.399
 doctors in general start to cluster 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.199
 even to use that the focus is not disease 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.850
 So let's treat depression is not 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.249
 you 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.100
 because even the mental disorders each 

00:00:56.249 --> 00:01:01.920
 one will be you take such a remedy will not 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.040
 working for me is very specific 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.320
 It's personal, then you have that person. 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.290
 her history you have to background 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.490
 then in addition to the analysis in addition to taking a 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.930
 medicine 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.149
 Let's also change the way of life. 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.640
 Let's do yoga, which is a practice that 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:20.909
 promotes a super well being time 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.009
 the people demand has several places 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.189
 has a cheap price for free? 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.799
 yoga that helps to have well-being is 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.259
 an unusual business and it is a practice 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.729
 What I think should be in schools. 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.549
 because it helps even in this 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:39.119
 process of self-knowledge of you 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:42.240
 Knowing your body is only you 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:46.229
 all that people are not just bodies or 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.030
 head people are the body mind you 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.189
 have to treat everything medicine 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.329
 integrative this she treats you all 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.869
 total 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:57.810
 and there is also uses meditation meditation 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.859
 the findings that 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.200
 were made thanks to the meditation of 

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:06.210
 improvements in patients and this is already 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.970
 identify mind proven then they 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.970
 using various techniques to help 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.430
 You to have well-being that even I did not 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.450
 Everybody gives you better and this was a 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.170
 This is the only process that is not 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.170
 like this 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.930
 no it's not a repressive or you have the 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.819
 bipolar disorder and bipolar disorder and 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.920
 Suddenly you talk like this, I improved. 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.930
 sarney does not exist 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.390
 all this is why you have to accept 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.280
 and accept the same as another 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.440
 diabetes that will live with diabetes 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.760
 life you will have to deal with a 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.200
 upset mind 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.150
 so you have to know your 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.010
 why these 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.200
 practices help so much that the 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.209
 psychotherapy helps both because you have 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.030
 that is in addition to all the medication 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.560
 Sometimes it feels so bad when I started. 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.910
 practicing yoga was greater because it was 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.920
 I could not force myself and everything 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.110
 but it was very difficult then the ideal 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.569
 would be first is better then you take 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.549
 remedies and from that improved to 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:09.120
 you behind this change in style 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:11.640
 Life is changing Everything is eating is 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.890
 There is no miracle there is no use finding 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.590
 a girl asked me what his was in his 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.010
 therapist with a session is better 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.840
 impossible 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.260
 There are these people. I'll make you. 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.049
 exception to the rule in life has not and is 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.000
 accept this I have this limitation has 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:30.239
 which then keep an eye on my routine 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.570
 I stopped drinking today, I do not drink anymore 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.709
 I stopped smoking everything I used to run away 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.079
 of that malaise 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.260
 I traded for other things than yoga 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:42.810
 meditation and sometimes physical is a life 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.829
 completely different and different from 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.720
 normal so these are things I would love 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:50.790
 know to have known when I was 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.100
 teenage child and did not know that 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.440
 there was none of this then I would have 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.170
 Helped a lot, I knew back pole. 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.140
 oh, there's something stopping that was what I 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.730
 I saw still occurs and played what and when 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.130
 was to make discover that with nothing 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.630
 Jack is the business that brings a 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:10.709
 It is too 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:13.019

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:16.609
