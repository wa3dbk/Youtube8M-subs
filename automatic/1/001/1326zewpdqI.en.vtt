00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
of all you have to have to port forward

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.480 
of all you have to have to port forward
your<00:00:23.789> router<00:00:24.060> or<00:00:24.570> modem<00:00:24.920> or<00:00:25.920> whatever<00:00:26.340> you

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
using now you don't port forward then

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.249 
using now you don't port forward then
you<00:00:29.039> won't<00:00:29.279> be<00:00:29.400> able<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.939> do<00:00:30.060> it<00:00:30.210> now<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.900> port

realize<00:03:23.280> that<00:03:23.730> we<00:03:23.879> brought<00:03:24.120> forward<00:03:24.329> 80<00:03:24.689> and

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:25.439 
realize that we brought forward 80 and

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:28.869 
realize that we brought forward 80 and
the<00:03:26.250> Apache<00:03:26.879> needs<00:03:27.239> to<00:03:27.419> listen<00:03:27.599> to<00:03:27.959> port<00:03:28.229> 80<00:03:28.440> so

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 
the Apache needs to listen to port 80 so

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:32.509 
the Apache needs to listen to port 80 so
people<00:03:29.879> can<00:03:30.030> access<00:03:30.209> it<00:03:30.599> so<00:03:30.629> them<00:03:31.519> basically

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
people can access it so them basically

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.000 
people can access it so them basically
