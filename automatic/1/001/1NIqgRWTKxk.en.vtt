00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.330
 in children with deficit disorder 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.640
 of attention and hyperactivity or tdh as 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.560
 it is usually called the symptoms of 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.110
 lack of attention hyperactivity e 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.039
 Impulsivity hinder realization 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.289
 of daily activities 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.179
 How the symptom profile can vary 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.040
 it is important that the treatment be 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:35.520
 adapt to the individual needs of 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.520
 each child 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.740
 the combination of treatments 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.329
 psychosocial and pharmacological 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.879
 required 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.260
 investigations have been carried out 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.879
 scientific studies to determine the effects 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.559
 of psychosocial treatments and 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.260
 pharmacological tests on the brain of 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.510
 patient with tdh has been proven that 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.859
 the drugs for the cdh act 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.390
 about the functions of certain 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:00.299
 natural chemicals 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.519
 brain in particular dopamine and the 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:05.350
 noradrenaline and that are compounds that 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:07.060
 transmit messages between neurons 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.860
 these chemicals are 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.920
 important for the brain to work 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.850
 normally in terms of movement 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.830
 attention learning and activation 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.540
 the evidence suggests that the systems 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.280
 that control concentrations of 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.130
 these chemical compounds are 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.960
 altered in the ph and that it contributes 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.500
 to generate the symptoms of lack of 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.390
 attention hyperactivity and impulsivity 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.830
 it is believed that the medicines for the cdh 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.540
 act on these systems to 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.210
 stimulate chemical communication between 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.830
 nerve cells for example has been 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.840
 pointed out that they could reduce the 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.159
 elimination of dopamine that could 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.600
 cause the improvement of symptoms 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.600
 cdh nuclear 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.799
 stimulate chemical communication 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.600
 this way could improve the connection 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.780
 between the wider networks of cells 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.780
 nervous 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.080
 there are neuroimaging studies that indicate 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.670
 that the drugs for the cdh could 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.470
 operate acting on networks 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.880
 brain that affect the attention already 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.880
 the inhibition of impulsive behavior 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.280
 along with these effects has been observed 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.050
 that over time the use of stimulants 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.210
 It also helps to normalize the size of 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.160
 these brain structures that at 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.200
 general are smaller in children 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.890
 with tdh than in those who do not suffer from this 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.870
 disorder 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.270
 these structures are intervened in 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.010
 processes like memory attention the 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.330
 thought and language 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.459
 also with treatments 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.560
 Psychosocial have observed some 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.750
 structural brain changes and 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.860
 functional although the data available 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.050
 they are limited 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.210
 As with all medications 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.460
 those of the cdh can produce effects 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.680
 secondary is important to use the 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.690
 medication as directed by the doctor and 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.430
 have a defined plan to monitor and 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.920
 control side effects 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.930
 tea treatment can help 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.189
 control the most important symptoms 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.739
 being able to improve the skills 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:05.349
 social self-esteem and in some 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:08.079
 academic performance and with the 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:09.640
 adequate support children with tdh could 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:12.410
 get to have fuller lives and 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.120
 satisfactory 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.250
 and understand the effects of treatment 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.290
 about the brain and why they vary from one 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.850
 child to another could contribute to improve 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.830
 treatment options for 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.000
 provide better assistance to all 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.000
 people with td h
