Tuesday and today we'll be looking at

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.599 
Tuesday and today we'll be looking at
more<00:00:17.880> accents<00:00:18.630> in<00:00:19.410> last<00:00:19.740> week's<00:00:20.010> video<00:00:20.220> we

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
more accents in last week's video we

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.599 
more accents in last week's video we
studied<00:00:21.090> playing<00:00:21.480> accents<00:00:22.289> on<00:00:22.439> 16th<00:00:23.310> note

subdivisions<00:00:23.910> in<00:00:24.779> today's<00:00:25.470> video<00:00:25.740> we'll<00:00:26.460> be

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
subdivisions in today's video we'll be

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.439 
subdivisions in today's video we'll be
doing<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.939> same<00:00:27.150> thing<00:00:27.210> but<00:00:27.990> with<00:00:28.230> triplets

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
doing the same thing but with triplets

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:31.970 
doing the same thing but with triplets
now<00:00:30.449> we<00:00:30.510> can<00:00:30.720> count<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.080> subdivision<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.890> a

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
now we can count the subdivision of a

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.900 
now we can count the subdivision of a
triplet<00:00:32.250> as<00:00:32.690> one<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:33.960> up<00:00:34.320> two<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.920> three<00:00:35.340> and

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
triplet as one and up two and three and

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.440 
triplet as one and up two and three and
four<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.930> up<00:00:37.550> first<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.730> all<00:00:38.850> we<00:00:39.120> should<00:00:39.180> just

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
four and up first of all we should just

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.479 
four and up first of all we should just
practice<00:00:39.660> getting<00:00:40.140> our<00:00:40.379> accents<00:00:40.950> on<00:00:41.129> each<00:00:41.309> of

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
practice getting our accents on each of

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.520 
practice getting our accents on each of
those<00:00:41.610> subdivisions<00:00:42.090> we'll<00:00:43.079> start<00:00:43.320> with<00:00:43.500> just

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
those subdivisions we'll start with just

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.130 
those subdivisions we'll start with just
the<00:00:43.800> down<00:00:44.010> stroke<00:00:44.489> on<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:45.090> one<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.570> two<00:00:45.600> three

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
the down stroke on the one the two three

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.670 
the down stroke on the one the two three
and<00:00:46.170> four<00:00:46.530> one<00:00:46.969> and<00:00:47.969> up<00:00:48.270> two<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.780> A<00:00:49.110> three<00:00:49.140> and

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
and four one and up two and A three and

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:58.729 
and four one and up two and A three and
a<00:00:50.039> four<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.640> ER<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:57.530> that's<00:00:58.530> pretty

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
a four and ER so that's pretty

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.229 
a four and ER so that's pretty
straightforward<00:00:59.070> but<00:00:59.609> just<00:00:59.789> remember<00:01:00.120> that

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
straightforward but just remember that

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.240 
straightforward but just remember that
we're<00:01:00.539> alternating<00:01:00.930> between<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.739> right<00:01:02.010> and

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
we're alternating between the right and

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.740 
we're alternating between the right and
the<00:01:02.340> left<00:01:02.399> hand<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.969> play<00:01:03.000> those<00:01:03.359> accents

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
the left hand to play those accents

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.719 
the left hand to play those accents
they're<00:01:04.080> now<00:01:04.739> in<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:04.949> middle<00:01:05.189> here<00:01:05.309> we<00:01:05.549> have

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
they're now in the middle here we have

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.620 
they're now in the middle here we have
the<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.650> one<00:01:07.650> end<00:01:07.890> up<00:01:08.250> two<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.820> up<00:01:09.150> three<00:01:09.450> and

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
the and one end up two and up three and

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:21.380 
the and one end up two and up three and
up<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:18.020> finally<00:01:19.020> we<00:01:19.259> have<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.590> AH<00:01:19.820> one<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.119> AH

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
up and finally we have the AH one and AH

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:30.910 
up and finally we have the AH one and AH
two<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.960> AH<00:01:22.259> three<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.650> AH<00:01:23.159> four<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.880> Oh

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.289 

before<00:01:31.920> we<00:01:32.130> move<00:01:32.400> on<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.759> next<00:01:32.939> part<00:01:33.210> of

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
before we move on to the next part of

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.179 
before we move on to the next part of
this<00:01:33.420> lesson<00:01:33.659> just<00:01:34.290> spend<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.560> bit<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.740> time<00:01:34.829> if

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
this lesson just spend a bit of time if

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.770 
this lesson just spend a bit of time if
you<00:01:35.280> metronome<00:01:35.700> practicing<00:01:36.299> each<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.630> those

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
you metronome practicing each of those

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.530 
you metronome practicing each of those
accents<00:01:37.380> now<00:01:38.130> like<00:01:38.400> last<00:01:38.700> week<00:01:38.970> we're<00:01:39.450> going

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
accents now like last week we're going

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.240 
accents now like last week we're going
to<00:01:39.600> put<00:01:39.780> all<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:39.930> into<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.380> same<00:01:40.590> exercise

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
to put all that into the same exercise

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.980 
to put all that into the same exercise
but<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:41.939> time<00:01:42.150> we'll<00:01:42.270> just<00:01:42.299> be<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.509> three<00:01:42.810> bar

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
but this time we'll just be a three bar

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.499 
but this time we'll just be a three bar
pattern<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.979> first<00:01:44.220> bar<00:01:44.490> will<00:01:44.700> be<00:01:44.790> accents<00:01:45.390> on

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
pattern the first bar will be accents on

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.020 
pattern the first bar will be accents on
those<00:01:45.659> down<00:01:45.930> strikes<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.250> 1<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.640> 2<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.850> 3

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
those down strikes so the 1 the 2 the 3

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.810 
those down strikes so the 1 the 2 the 3
and<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.479> 4<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:49.320> second<00:01:49.740> bar<00:01:49.979> will<00:01:50.189> be<00:01:50.280> accents

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
and the 4 the second bar will be accents

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.969 
and the 4 the second bar will be accents
on<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.030> end<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.689> then<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.200> third<00:01:52.530> bar<00:01:52.799> will

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
on the end and then the third bar will

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.880 
on the end and then the third bar will
be<00:01:53.070> accents<00:01:53.670> on<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:54.000> are<00:01:54.350> so<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.380> have<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.619> one

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
be accents on the are so I have a one

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.410 
be accents on the are so I have a one
and<00:01:55.920> A<00:01:56.159> two<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.340> A<00:01:56.549> three<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.909> four<00:01:56.939> all<00:01:57.390> the

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
and A two and A three and a four all the

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.969 
and A two and A three and a four all the
way<00:01:57.509> through<00:01:57.840> there<00:01:58.140> are<00:01:58.200> different<00:01:58.500> accents

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
way through there are different accents

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.950 
way through there are different accents
so<00:01:59.310> have<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.670> go<00:01:59.850> out<00:01:59.969> playing<00:02:00.210> along<00:02:00.570> with<00:02:00.600> this

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
so have a go out playing along with this

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.440 
so have a go out playing along with this
and<00:02:01.229> count<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.040> out<00:02:02.159> as<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.490> go<00:02:02.670> if<00:02:03.119> you're<00:02:03.329> on

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
and count it out as you go if you're on

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.639 
and count it out as you go if you're on
YouTube<00:02:03.840> or<00:02:04.020> watching<00:02:04.290> this<00:02:04.380> at<00:02:04.530> your

YouTube or watching this at your

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.069 
YouTube or watching this at your
computer<00:02:05.070> just<00:02:05.250> tap<00:02:06.030> out<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.509> rhythm<00:02:06.659> on<00:02:06.899> your

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
computer just tap out the rhythm on your

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.130 
computer just tap out the rhythm on your
knees<00:02:07.229> if<00:02:07.590> you're<00:02:07.740> not<00:02:07.860> need

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
knees if you're not need

on our snare drum drum kit whatever you
want<00:02:10.720> to<00:02:10.780> practice<00:02:10.929> on<00:02:11.230> okay<00:02:12.010> I'll<00:02:12.100> try<00:02:12.310> and

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
want to practice on okay I'll try and

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.010 
want to practice on okay I'll try and
count<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:12.940> play<00:02:13.330> this<00:02:13.569> but<00:02:13.810> I'll<00:02:13.900> probably

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
count and play this but I'll probably

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.570 
count and play this but I'll probably
out<00:02:14.230> of<00:02:14.410> breath<00:02:14.650> house<00:02:14.890> way<00:02:15.100> through<00:02:15.400> or

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
out of breath house way through or

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.650 
out of breath house way through or
something<00:02:16.650> one<00:02:17.650> end<00:02:17.950> up<00:02:18.190> to<00:02:18.430> end<00:02:18.760> up<00:02:19.000> three<00:02:19.330> and

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
something one end up to end up three and

00:02:19.660 --> 00:03:01.380 
something one end up to end up three and
four<00:02:20.200> and<00:02:20.440> one<00:02:42.000> two<00:02:43.000> three<00:02:59.820> okay<00:03:00.820> so<00:03:01.000> that<00:03:01.269> was

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
four and one two three okay so that was

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.240 
four and one two three okay so that was
just<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:01.660> basic<00:03:02.080> outline<00:03:02.470> of<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.650> exercise

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
just the basic outline of the exercise

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.729 
just the basic outline of the exercise
so<00:03:03.640> it's<00:03:04.510> a<00:03:04.570> pretty<00:03:04.750> good<00:03:04.840> exercise<00:03:05.470> to

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
so it's a pretty good exercise to

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.610 
so it's a pretty good exercise to
practice<00:03:05.950> counting<00:03:06.810> accents<00:03:07.810> and<00:03:08.050> so<00:03:08.260> on

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
practice counting accents and so on

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.009 
practice counting accents and so on
but<00:03:09.100> I'm<00:03:09.340> not<00:03:09.760> really<00:03:09.970> a<00:03:10.090> fan<00:03:10.360> of<00:03:10.390> the<00:03:10.690> three

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
but I'm not really a fan of the three

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.110 
but I'm not really a fan of the three
bar<00:03:11.320> loop<00:03:11.800> that<00:03:12.100> we've<00:03:12.220> got<00:03:12.400> going<00:03:12.640> here

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
bar loop that we've got going here

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.750 
bar loop that we've got going here
so<00:03:13.650> here's<00:03:14.650> something<00:03:14.890> that<00:03:15.130> I<00:03:15.190> think<00:03:15.280> sounds

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
so here's something that I think sounds

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.789 
so here's something that I think sounds
a<00:03:15.850> little<00:03:15.970> bit<00:03:16.180> better<00:03:16.239> we'll<00:03:17.079> just<00:03:17.230> play<00:03:17.500> a

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
a little bit better we'll just play a

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.400 
a little bit better we'll just play a
bar<00:03:18.310> other<00:03:18.790> accents<00:03:19.299> on<00:03:19.420> the<00:03:19.510> downstairs<00:03:20.049> one

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
bar other accents on the downstairs one

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.380 
bar other accents on the downstairs one
two<00:03:20.620> three<00:03:20.890> four<00:03:21.220> and<00:03:21.459> then<00:03:21.820> the<00:03:21.850> next<00:03:22.180> bar

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
two three four and then the next bar

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.900 
two three four and then the next bar
just<00:03:22.720> on<00:03:22.900> the<00:03:23.019> one<00:03:23.739> end<00:03:24.010> of<00:03:24.190> two<00:03:24.400> and<00:03:24.700> A<00:03:24.880> three

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
just on the one end of two and A three

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:45.170 
just on the one end of two and A three
and<00:03:25.360> a<00:03:25.570> four<00:03:25.600> and<00:03:26.019> up

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
can do the same thing alternating

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.560 
can do the same thing alternating
between<00:04:07.870> a<00:04:08.320> downstroke<00:04:08.980> accent<00:04:09.580> and<00:04:09.790> accents
