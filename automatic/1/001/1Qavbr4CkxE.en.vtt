00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
 all right 

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:08.590
 Welcome to online drawing before 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.019
 we draw this corpulent character type 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.730
 american if you have not seen it will be from 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:14.860
 very useful to see it for the class of 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.140
 today there are many types of characters 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.710
 strong today we will draw this character 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:23.050
 well known and very corpulent the most 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.580
 basic and important that we should know is 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.260
 that these types of characters have 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.170
 body and extremities and exaggeratedly 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.370
 wide and small head if your 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.259
 look for they have these qualities 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.230
 you will surely make your characters 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.520
 look very strong observe in color 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.070
 red like shoulders and hips 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.510
 they are very far apart and the hands and feet 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.550
 they are so big that maybe they are more 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.290
 big that the head 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.579
 being the same principles that 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.379
 we just commented 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.390
 we make a sketch with more movement 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.100
 suddenly these characters more than 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.960
 strong they might look fat 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.750
 but by adding some muscles 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.110
 they acquire a more definitive form now 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.480
 we will draw this character step by step 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.520
 in green we draw two divisions 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.110
 the top part is the size of the 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.600
 body and the bottom part will be the 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.490
 size of the legs we draw the area 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.470
 of the legs slightly smaller 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.390
 that the body area 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.729
 next we will draw the head in 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.440
 oval shape its size is less than 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.690
 fourth part of the body size 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.730
 we draw two sloping lines that 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.830
 pass inside the head as seen in 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.860
 the dotted line which will be the 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.540
 trapeze these lines are very long with 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.720
 the purpose that the shoulders are 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.090
 very separated we draw two lines towards 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.000
 the waist in this case the waist is not 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.490
 very thin and then other lines towards 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.700
 the hip slightly wider than the 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.730
 Waist from the end of the body 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.590
 we draw a very wide arm observes the 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:51.260
 point where the arm makes contact with 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.080
 the body this point almost reaches the 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.900
 waist in the same way we draw the other 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.150
 arm arms end up at height 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.010
 where the legs begin we draw 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.860
 the hands in a circular shape under the 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.150
 green line where the legs begin 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.520
 to draw the legs we draw 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.100
 first a little line this because 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.870
 the legs by voluminous come together and 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.850
 from this point we draw the 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.130
 legs wide and slightly 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.830
 curves to the base that marks the line 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.140
 green and finally we draw the feet 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.240
 using the shape as of a triangle 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.100
 curved 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.560
 look at the area of ​​the feet that 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.440
 protrudes from the legs so we end up 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.360
 the general form of this body 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.730
 now let's check some details in 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.800
 circular shape we draw the shoulders and 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.260
 the area of ​​the biceps using a line 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.150
 inclined to make them look better as 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.700
 Mark the green arrow and then 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.660
 we draw the forearm we do the same 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.660
 in the other arm 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.260
 we mark a point for the knees 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.940
 on which we draw a few lines 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.459
 inclined as marked by 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.930
 arrows these inclined lines will serve 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.330
 of reference so that the legs are 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.000
 see better on the knees we draw 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.370
 the legs in a circular shape and also 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.560
 the part of the pimples observes that 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.599
 the widest section is where we mark 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.510
 the slanted lines as marked by 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:13.080
 green dots we draw a kind of 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.120
 letter for the pubis 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.400
 we draw the chest to the same height as 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.540
 the shoulders and the clavicles slightly 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.130
 inclined 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.470
 under the chest and we draw two small 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.210
 lines to give body shape and 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.760
 under the chest we draw the muscles 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:30.000
 abdominals observe that the navel is 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.980
 slightly above the waist now in the 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.450
 part of the obliques we continue some 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.510
 lines on which we draw the 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.980
 muscles that connect to the ribs 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.620
 these are drawn more or less as seen 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.230
 in the diagram we draw some lines 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.090
 curves on the chest the lines on 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.040
 the shoulders have a similar curvature 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.930
 to the chest lines 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.970
 we remark the abdominal muscles and 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.980
 under the neck we draw something like 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.900
 a letter v that are the muscles 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.989
 main neck 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.269
 the biceps part of the tip of the shoulder and 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.700
 of the tip of the biceps part a line 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.739
 that divides the forearm to vary a 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.299
 little we draw the other arm slightly 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.040
 gotten up 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.930
 we emphasize the knees and on them 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.870
 we draw something like the shape of a 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:15.209
 drop like this is this muscle we draw the 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.389
 cufflinks and ankles with square shapes 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.889
 and the slightly curved pimples the 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:22.500
 drawing of hands and feet 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.390
 we will teach later 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.640
 we complained about the face and added 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.080
 details such as clothing and a proposal 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.880
 shadows on the body 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.920
 the small arrows indicate the place of 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.850
 where the light comes from and that's how we end up 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.960
 our drawing just have to add color 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.240
 first we draw some shadows 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.730
 heavy following the shadows that before 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.790
 we draw in our stroke and the shapes 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:47.370
 muscle and then we add some 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.900
 lights on the side of the body little by little 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.690
 our character adopts a form 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.910
 three-dimensional we add all kinds of 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.880
 details at the end we will even add 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.870
 some veins in the extremities 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.910
 we hope this class will be useful 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.730

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.340
 the next
