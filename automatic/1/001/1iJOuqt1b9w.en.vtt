00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.970 

I<00:00:30.519> began<00:00:31.449> teaching<00:00:31.720> before<00:00:32.140> I<00:00:32.410> was<00:00:32.739> married

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
I began teaching before I was married

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.010 
I began teaching before I was married
and<00:00:33.550> definitely<00:00:34.329> before<00:00:34.540> having<00:00:34.989> children

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.020 
and definitely before having children

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.979 
and definitely before having children
and<00:00:35.500> so<00:00:35.770> I<00:00:35.800> watched<00:00:36.340> children<00:00:37.000> firsthand<00:00:37.360> lose

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
and so I watched children firsthand lose

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:43.080 
and so I watched children firsthand lose
the<00:00:38.470> light<00:00:38.649> and<00:00:38.949> love<00:00:39.430> of<00:00:39.699> learning

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.220

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
instead of just to get my kids a good

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.500 
instead of just to get my kids a good
education<00:00:45.920> I<00:00:46.130> wanted<00:00:46.820> to<00:00:46.910> get<00:00:47.120> given
