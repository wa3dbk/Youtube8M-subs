this<00:00:01.020> is<00:00:01.260> a<00:00:01.380> gamecube<00:00:01.740> controller<00:00:03.410> that's

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
this is a gamecube controller that's

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:11.839 
this is a gamecube controller that's
wire<00:00:08.870> and<00:00:09.870> this<00:00:10.080> is<00:00:10.380> my<00:00:10.620> Lego<00:00:10.950> representation

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
wire and this is my Lego representation

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:12.320 
wire and this is my Lego representation
of<00:00:11.940> it

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
of it

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:19.840 
of it
it's<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.620> wire<00:00:18.050> yeah

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
it's the wire yeah

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:27.410 
it's the wire yeah
analog<00:00:20.850> stick<00:00:21.529> I'll<00:00:23.269> start<00:00:25.010> d-pad<00:00:26.420> handle

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
analog stick I'll start d-pad handle

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:39.459 
analog stick I'll start d-pad handle
spit<00:00:28.140> sticks<00:00:28.769> out<00:00:29.449> see<00:00:30.449> stick<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:33.050> B<00:00:34.050> Y<00:00:34.530> X<00:00:37.610> Z<00:00:38.610> are

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:39.469 
spit sticks out see stick a B Y X Z are

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:41.209 
spit sticks out see stick a B Y X Z are
of<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.649> handle

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
of the handle

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.010 
of the handle
there's<00:00:42.149> your<00:00:42.239> molding<00:00:42.629> on<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.750> bottom

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
there's your molding on the bottom

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.400 
there's your molding on the bottom
though<00:00:43.170> which<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:43.920> unfortunate<00:00:44.750> because<00:00:45.750> if

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
though which is unfortunate because if

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.040 
though which is unfortunate because if
you<00:00:46.500> look<00:00:46.730> from<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.820> actual<00:00:48.570> game<00:00:48.840> view

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
you look from the actual game view

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.069 
you look from the actual game view
controller<00:00:49.110> there's<00:00:49.710> lots<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:49.950> molding<00:00:51.079> which

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
controller there's lots of molding which

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.389 
controller there's lots of molding which
is<00:00:52.230> really<00:00:52.500> nice<00:00:54.739> and<00:00:55.739> yes<00:00:56.160> this<00:00:56.340> is

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
is really nice and yes this is

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.549 
is really nice and yes this is
third-party<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.780> normal<00:00:58.109> one<00:00:58.230> doesn't<00:00:58.469> have

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
third-party the normal one doesn't have

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.119 
third-party the normal one doesn't have
two<00:00:58.710> below<00:00:59.190> this<00:00:59.430> logo<00:01:00.320> all<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.590> second<00:01:01.949> set

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
two below this logo all the second set

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.469 
two below this logo all the second set
but<00:01:02.520> look<00:01:04.010> and<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.220> d-pad<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.820> lot<00:01:06.060> better

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
but look and the d-pad is a lot better

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.660 
but look and the d-pad is a lot better
well<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.350> think<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.830> d-pads<00:01:08.189> better<00:01:08.400> on<00:01:08.549> this

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
well I think the d-pads better on this

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:16.280 
well I think the d-pads better on this
way<00:01:13.400> and<00:01:14.400> yes<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:15.210> LEGO<00:01:15.390> version<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.930> lot

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
way and yes the LEGO version is a lot

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.060 
way and yes the LEGO version is a lot
bigger<00:01:16.619> than<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.100> actual<00:01:17.340> vision<00:01:18.049> again

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.130 

actually<00:01:23.070> no<00:01:23.220> it's<00:01:23.490> not<00:01:23.580> bigger<00:01:24.180> not<00:01:24.960> much

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
actually no it's not bigger not much

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.520 
actually no it's not bigger not much
bigger<00:01:25.409> but<00:01:25.740> still<00:01:25.770> bigger<00:01:27.140> so<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.970> also

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
bigger but still bigger so it is also

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.109 
bigger but still bigger so it is also
smaller<00:01:31.530> in<00:01:31.829> height<00:01:31.860> than<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.700> last<00:01:32.880> one

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
smaller in height than the last one

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.390 
smaller in height than the last one
there's<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.750> Game<00:01:33.990> Boy<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:36.229> this<00:01:37.229> one<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.829> n64

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
there's a Game Boy and this one the n64

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.310 
there's a Game Boy and this one the n64
one<00:01:38.759> went<00:01:39.450> all<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.659> way<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.020> end<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.229> the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
one went all the way to the end of the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.080 
one went all the way to the end of the
Gameboy<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.890> this<00:01:41.250> one<00:01:41.400> only<00:01:41.549> goes<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:42.000> the

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
Gameboy and this one only goes to the

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.109 
Gameboy and this one only goes to the
top<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.659> screen<00:01:43.579> it's<00:01:44.579> not<00:01:44.670> as<00:01:44.880> thick<00:01:45.000> as

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
top of the screen it's not as thick as

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.130 
top of the screen it's not as thick as
the<00:01:45.210> game<00:01:45.360> lower<00:01:45.540> though<00:01:45.659> it's<00:01:45.810> about<00:01:45.960> two

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
the game lower though it's about two

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:53.710 
the game lower though it's about two
thick<00:01:46.290> as<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.560> 3ds

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:01.600
