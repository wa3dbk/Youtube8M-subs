a tractor and it was lucky it was that
no<00:01:07.080> current<00:01:08.070> there<00:01:08.430> at<00:01:08.549> all<00:01:08.700> in<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.659> Yukon<00:01:10.110> is

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
no current there at all in the Yukon is

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.340 
no current there at all in the Yukon is
very<00:01:11.250> muddy<00:01:11.610> but<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.330> Yukon<00:01:12.810> was<00:01:13.049> about<00:01:13.320> a

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
very muddy but the Yukon was about a

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.770 
very muddy but the Yukon was about a
mile<00:01:13.680> away<00:01:13.890> on<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.369> North<00:01:14.610> Shore<00:01:14.780> Yukoners

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
mile away on the North Shore Yukoners

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.310 
mile away on the North Shore Yukoners
real<00:01:16.140> wide<00:01:16.439> there<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.509> so<00:01:18.509> this<00:01:18.720> tractor<00:01:19.200> was

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
real wide there and so this tractor was

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.640 
real wide there and so this tractor was
in<00:01:19.470> there<00:01:19.619> in<00:01:20.340> there<00:01:20.640> for<00:01:20.850> two<00:01:21.030> weeks<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.650> we

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
in there in there for two weeks and we

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.440 
in there in there for two weeks and we
pulled<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.159> ashore<00:01:23.250> under<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.909> ice<00:01:24.060> with<00:01:24.420> a

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
pulled it ashore under the ice with a

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.920 
pulled it ashore under the ice with a
cable<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.430> this<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.670> Travis<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.420> taking<00:01:27.810> the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
cable and this is Travis is taking the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.780 
cable and this is Travis is taking the
bulldozer<00:01:28.650> out<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.130> water<00:01:29.340> here<00:01:29.700> the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
roots coming out

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.679 
roots coming out
we<00:01:31.829> put<00:01:32.100> big<00:01:32.310> poles<00:01:32.640> under<00:01:33.090> their<00:01:33.299> tracks

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
we put big poles under their tracks

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.730 
we put big poles under their tracks
because<00:01:34.229> this<00:01:34.470> was<00:01:36.320> because<00:01:37.320> there<00:01:37.560> was<00:01:37.680> a

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
because this was because there was a

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.770 
because this was because there was a
cutback<00:01:38.460> there<00:01:38.850> they<00:01:39.030> were<00:01:39.090> about<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.390> four<00:01:39.689> or

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
five foot cutback and we had to put

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.460 
five foot cutback and we had to put
poles<00:01:42.030> under<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.570> tracks<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:43.140> pull<00:01:43.350> the

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
poles under the tracks to pull the
