00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:51.280
 just about everything you need it is 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.089
 asparagus as much as you 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.399

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:55.750
 he is now well washed off so the 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:57.910
 I have really good under 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.929
 washed off running water it is 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.910
 important because we do not shells 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:03.010
 throw away but later for the 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.490
 Do you need something magic master need 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.340
 salt some sugar and some butter and 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.340
 of course, the magic master so now 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:15.360
 It's preparing ans and go with 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.360
 the schiller 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:50.350
 now you take this whole bowl and 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.360
 do that in the clean master and pure 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.649
 Although it will later on the rods 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.649
 prayed asparagus 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.509
 of course, the ends have to be done now 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.509
 the woody ends are cut off 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.370
 Yes 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:32.319
 and the whole looks now first like 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.319
 yes you need a teaspoon of salt now 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:47.000
 he just sprinkles over that 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:47.750
 asparagus in silver over in tampa beautiful 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.549
 distributed 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:54.879
 wonderful then he asks a teaspoon 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.879
 sugar 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.740
 and a few flakes of butter comes after 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.740
 above 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:21.530
 So here looks like the blanket 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.750
 on top of that is the wizard 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.580
 whole goes now as always on the rust 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.040
 and that is a school subject upper 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.050
 I have the oven now 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.100
 preheated to 200 degrees 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.510
 and I think so 25 to 30 minutes 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.070
 that would have to stay in the oven now 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.170
 I'll bring you back and show you 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.450
 you then the finished result until then 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.310
 take care 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.900
 my asparagus are now as far as I get 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.480
 Get it out now, but I'll say it too 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.250
 I'll have one soon 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.640
 relatively new oven and I have to 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:55.850
 my temperatures as rausfinden 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.070
 oven because it now needed 230 degrees 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.420
 and he also needed a little longer and 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.820
 Although 40 minutes 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.070
 you just have to do it with your oven 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.690
 try you can not generally there 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.690
 say she is now at this 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.640
 number of degrees and as long as you have to 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.520
 Simply test and malta fork 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.100
 pierce and I'll show you now 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.510
 I dare it have become great 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.750
 I've had it before now 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.750
 tested 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:32.030

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.580
 the lid so and now you look now 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:38.300

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:41.480

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:49.130

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.069

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:19.750

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:23.680
