00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:03.829
 and 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:13.519
 very good to all the kids well 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:16.300
 measured from u and what happens to my knees 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.300
 Hello 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:20.480
 nonsense good guys welcome to 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.130
 a new video and it is that today I bring you a 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.250
 way a subscriber had told me 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.830
 by twitter pension ticket the mobile that 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.580
 so cool that such and I did not know 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.900
 break mod 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.760
 apparently it will only be for the version 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.780
 1.6 points that I will not bring because a 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.940
 very old review and for 16.412 sorry 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.140
 and it's a monster that does get 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.140
 as you see animations for example 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.989
 Quite a lot more and more fun 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.760
 is super funny has more in 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.240
 images but the one of correctly super 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.390
 cool affection 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.460
 when it jumped what seems like a 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.170
 little crappy that for example have not 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.550
 done as in the moving sea that when 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.240
 fly looks like soft but it looks 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:15.210
 like when nothing looks exactly the same 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.610
 they try to go the same is a bit ugly 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.690
 the truth that looks like that but good 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.390
 it's true that they put you on 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.020
 university are cool for example from 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.020
 what was it like 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.550
 that more life for example with the sword 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.900
 I have a year here 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.900
 the pagans in front 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.540
 say that all this is noticeable when you're 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.220
 in external view like this in view of 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.500
 inside it looks like mainka of all the 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.390
 life is worth so we find it 6 weird 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.740
 this is also because they do not look like this 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.850
 moving people the odd pay ni 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.040
 nothing but to be after as always 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.960
 however, here it looks different 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.130
 good when you block it gets a little 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.570
 you see when what does not have 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.730
 animation gets like the abnormal mike 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.090
 it's not a little ugly but when it hits 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.090
 so it's going 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.020
 it is quite then for example the arc 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.230
 also has animation after the archi 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.230
 is there 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:16.640
 it gets cooler 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.020
 it does not really change much but then 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.460
 there are also some enemies for example 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.290
 they are micro that are the only ones in fact 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.910
 because others do not notice anything 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.050
 rare but the zombies and they have 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.490
 new animations and they are quite 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.299
 pretty cool 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.140
 also make night so you see 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:34.330
 thanks to that it is already there as with the 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:38.790
 knees crouched and if you look like 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.560
 I'm going for you all 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.739
 put the hands for before in plan and 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.739
 as well 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.390
 I'm very, very cool guys, yes 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.620
 I've seen that for example the clippers and 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.940
 otherwise I have not seen any animation 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.010
 special look at me the skeletons now 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.050
 that I think well see if they 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.550
 is totally animation weird you do not see 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.470
 the secrets are normal and current to 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.730
 that does not change all the characters 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.930
 for now but I guess with the 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.940
 update and that but putting 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.590
 animations to the cristeros what sender and 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.180
 others because people also seen it 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.950
 exactly the same 20 move by how 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.060
 I have also always seen that 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.060
 bichejos is me 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.130
 the sheep are the same as the cows 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.430
 truth that I have not tried distributing 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:24.640
 cow with me from the balls 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.590
 for example cow cows do not know if 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.810
 my knees have them a little 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.430
 more flexed does not appear from behind 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.590
 look when you hit him in this 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.050
 part of here how has the 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.580
 knee flexed from behind but it 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.680
 moves very similar or is it really not 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.510
 they notice practically nothing difference and 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.650
 let's see now with the pigs for 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:46.060
 example which is what we would have left 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:49.330
 look practically we look have changed 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.750
 of name pigs if you have put me as 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.750
 the zombies 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.040
 and this is zombies as always so 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.270
 nothing guys really what changes the most 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.740
 our character that are very very 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.180
 pimps I love this audio the 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.700
 animation of running is a past is 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:08.340
 super cool but the one to hit is or are or 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:10.890
 be the one of pepe thus in plan 26 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.200
 is super cool dude so let's see 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.180
 how the mode is installed let's move on to 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.169
 windows to see how it installs that already 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.609
 You will see that it is very simple because 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.739
 We are usually to have me 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.019
 new images usually always 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.790
 they have always have to put several 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.960
 files and more but this one is not 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.479
 simply in a file is already well 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.130
 that we're going to see as if the wii is 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:31.320
 is in this mode we need a force and 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.880
 steve as with all the others and 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.770
 you have the description how to install it 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.510
 you will also have the description a link 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.940
 where is my whole moody list where 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.380
 you will find the mobile is worth once 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.370
 have it downloaded from that list what 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.650
 what you have to do is put it in the 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.810
 folder your minecraft demo like 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.760
 we do this very simple because we have 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.440
 that press the windows button and rr the 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.700
 two at a time worth the windows button 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.200
 you have on the keyboard on the left 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.510
 next to control and high is rather 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.010
 between control and us the windows button 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.960
 and it was both or fits window 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:01.639
 execute you put percentage pp data 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:04.020
 percentage accept or put in minecraft 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:06.120
 mods and there you would have to copy it 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.430
 just take the file you copy it to 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.930
 500 and you would already have the mode 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.270
 installed and when you enter minecraft 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.800
 it would work to warn those of us 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.450
 some incompatibilities with some 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.630
 others who also have animations for 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.280
 more moving example or things like that you're not going to 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.930
 being able to put it on will not work well 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.030
 so I did not even 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.979
 I was trying so do not put that as 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.080
 that in itself also animations of 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:29.849
 other characters because not just 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.260
 work and fall to the air so the 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:32.910
 girl, I hope you've been there a lot 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.919
 so much adjusted to the law that is more 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.900
 with a mike doll here 6 boxing in 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:39.979
 plan rock and and see you in the next 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.979
 video to another
