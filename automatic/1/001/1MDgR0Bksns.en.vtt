for<00:03:59.570> you<00:03:59.630> guys<00:03:59.660> I<00:04:00.080> think<00:04:00.740> the<00:04:00.980> biggest<00:04:01.190> was

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.490 
for you guys I think the biggest was

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.520 
for you guys I think the biggest was
just<00:04:01.790> getting<00:04:02.510> the<00:04:02.780> lines<00:04:03.140> of<00:04:03.380> communication

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
just getting the lines of communication

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.920 
just getting the lines of communication
open<00:04:04.340> they<00:04:04.730> think<00:04:04.970> that<00:04:05.120> was<00:04:05.240> number<00:04:05.420> one<00:04:05.720> we

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
open they think that was number one we

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.870 
open they think that was number one we
were<00:04:06.140> a<00:04:06.440> little<00:04:06.770> individuals<00:04:07.520> kind<00:04:07.790> of

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
were a little individuals kind of

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.240 
were a little individuals kind of
running<00:04:08.120> much<00:04:08.420> and<00:04:08.660> just<00:04:08.810> not<00:04:09.650> coming<00:04:10.040> with

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
running much and just not coming with

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.310 
running much and just not coming with
any<00:04:10.400> kind<00:04:10.640> of<00:04:10.730> cohesion<00:04:11.180> or<00:04:11.900> any<00:04:12.080> family

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320
