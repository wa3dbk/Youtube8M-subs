the case family history shows
these<00:04:01.740> problems<00:04:02.130> start<00:04:02.340> around<00:04:02.580> the<00:04:02.730> age<00:04:02.880> 35

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
these problems start around the age 35

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.660 
these problems start around the age 35
and<00:04:03.780> I<00:04:03.930> can<00:04:04.110> show<00:04:04.260> our<00:04:04.290> patient<00:04:04.890> patient<00:04:05.460> is

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
and I can show our patient patient is

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.140 
and I can show our patient patient is
very<00:04:06.830> so<00:04:07.830> this<00:04:08.040> is<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.460> most<00:04:08.610> likely<00:04:08.880> cause

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
very so this is the most likely cause

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.090 
very so this is the most likely cause
