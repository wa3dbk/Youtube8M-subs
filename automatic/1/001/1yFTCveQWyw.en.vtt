begin threading is to bring this thread
guide<00:00:08.010> up<00:00:08.220> and<00:00:08.429> you<00:00:08.490> can<00:00:08.639> do<00:00:08.790> that<00:00:08.940> by<00:00:09.179> rotating

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
guide up and you can do that by rotating

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.749 
guide up and you can do that by rotating
the<00:00:09.630> hand<00:00:09.780> wheel<00:00:09.929> towards<00:00:10.349> yourself<00:00:10.740> so<00:00:11.670> you

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
the hand wheel towards yourself so you

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.860 
the hand wheel towards yourself so you
see<00:00:12.059> while<00:00:12.360> we're<00:00:12.509> rotating<00:00:12.690> it<00:00:14.509> this<00:00:15.509> thread

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
see while we're rotating it this thread

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.990 
see while we're rotating it this thread
guide<00:00:16.080> comes<00:00:16.289> up<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.650> top<00:00:16.680> as<00:00:17.550> does<00:00:17.880> the

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
guide comes up to the top as does the

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.900 
guide comes up to the top as does the
needle<00:00:18.270> come<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.660> top<00:00:18.810> here<00:00:19.730> so<00:00:20.730> you're

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
needle come to the top here so you're

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.509 
needle come to the top here so you're
gonna<00:00:21.029> take<00:00:21.270> your<00:00:21.330> spool<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:21.840> thread<00:00:22.519> and

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
gonna take your spool of thread and

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.519 
gonna take your spool of thread and
you're<00:00:23.670> gonna<00:00:23.760> place<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.300> onto<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.230> spool<00:00:25.500> pin

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
you're gonna place it onto the spool pin

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.890 
you're gonna place it onto the spool pin
like<00:00:26.099> so<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.910> want<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.210> thread<00:00:27.449> coming<00:00:27.720> off

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
like so you want the thread coming off

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.970 
like so you want the thread coming off
of<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.170> front<00:00:28.380> not<00:00:29.010> off<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.460> back<00:00:30.050> okay<00:00:31.109> so

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
of the front not off of the back okay so

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.760 
of the front not off of the back okay so
the<00:00:32.070> first<00:00:32.309> step<00:00:32.960> is<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.230> bring<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.530> thread

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
the first step is to bring the thread

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.770 
the first step is to bring the thread
through<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.100> first<00:00:35.130> thread<00:00:37.250> thread<00:00:38.250> guide

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
through the first thread thread guide

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.840 
through the first thread thread guide
and<00:00:39.780> then<00:00:39.930> down<00:00:40.309> you're<00:00:41.309> gonna<00:00:41.430> bring<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.670> up

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
and then down you're gonna bring it up

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.069 
and then down you're gonna bring it up
and<00:00:42.059> around<00:00:42.120> so<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.510> see<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.719> little<00:00:42.840> arrow

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
and around so you see it a little arrow

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.440 
and around so you see it a little arrow
tells<00:00:43.290> us<00:00:43.500> where<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.710> go<00:00:44.000> so<00:00:45.000> we're<00:00:45.120> gonna<00:00:45.210> come

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
tells us where to go so we're gonna come

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.080 
tells us where to go so we're gonna come
back<00:00:45.570> up<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.370> always<00:00:47.370> go<00:00:47.610> from<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.940> right

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
back up and you always go from the right

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.060 
back up and you always go from the right
to<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.360> left<00:00:48.629> up<00:00:48.809> here<00:00:48.890> so<00:00:49.890> you're<00:00:49.980> gonna

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
to the left up here so you're gonna

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.250 
to the left up here so you're gonna
bring<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.370> through<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:51.360> little<00:00:51.660> thread

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
bring it through this little thread

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.569 
bring it through this little thread
guide<00:00:52.469> right<00:00:52.649> there<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.100> can<00:00:53.250> see<00:00:53.430> that

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
there's a hole it's important that your

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.650 
there's a hole it's important that your
thread<00:00:56.699> goes<00:00:56.879> through<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.210> hole<00:00:57.360> from<00:00:57.390> the

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
thread goes through the hole from the

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.619 
thread goes through the hole from the
right<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.289> left<00:00:58.969> once<00:00:59.969> we've<00:01:00.239> done<00:01:00.420> that

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.389 
the bobbins gonna be rotating in a
counterclockwise<00:01:53.970> direction<00:01:55.310> you're<00:01:56.310> gonna

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
counterclockwise direction you're gonna

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
place that while holding the thread into

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.080 
place that while holding the thread into
the<00:01:59.640> bobbin<00:02:00.060> case<00:02:00.110> like<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.939> you're<00:02:02.939> gonna

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
the bobbin case like so and you're gonna

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.520 
the bobbin case like so and you're gonna
bring<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:04.290> thread<00:02:04.590> into<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:04.950> notch<00:02:05.159> and

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
bring that thread into that notch and

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.559 
bring that thread into that notch and
pull<00:02:07.580> with<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.640> little<00:02:08.910> bit<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.060> pressure<00:02:09.239> over

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
pull with a little bit of pressure over

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.380 
pull with a little bit of pressure over
here<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:10.140> that's<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.009> thread<00:02:11.400> guide<00:02:11.640> for<00:02:12.330> the

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
here and that's the thread guide for the

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.500 
here and that's the thread guide for the
bobbin<00:02:12.569> case

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
bobbin case

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.970 
bobbin case
your<00:02:13.780> next<00:02:14.019> step<00:02:14.170> you're<00:02:14.470> gonna<00:02:14.590> hold<00:02:14.860> it

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
your next step you're gonna hold it

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.809 
your next step you're gonna hold it
tightly<00:02:15.250> and<00:02:15.580> you're<00:02:16.540> gonna<00:02:16.659> pull<00:02:17.310> this<00:02:18.310> again

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
tightly and you're gonna pull this again

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.270 
tightly and you're gonna pull this again
and<00:02:19.439> that's<00:02:20.439> going<00:02:20.620> to<00:02:20.680> hold<00:02:20.829> the<00:02:21.040> bobbin

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
and that's going to hold the bobbin

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.550 
and that's going to hold the bobbin
tightly<00:02:21.790> inside<00:02:21.939> of<00:02:22.269> there<00:02:22.450> then<00:02:23.439> you're

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
tightly inside of there then you're

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.610 
tightly inside of there then you're
gonna<00:02:23.680> place<00:02:23.980> it<00:02:24.120> inside<00:02:25.120> of<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.299> machine<00:02:25.620> so

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
gonna place it inside of the machine so

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.990 
gonna place it inside of the machine so
it's<00:02:26.739> important<00:02:27.159> that<00:02:27.989> you<00:02:28.989> put<00:02:29.200> it<00:02:29.319> in

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
it's important that you put it in

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.050 
it's important that you put it in
straight<00:02:33.720> like<00:02:34.720> so<00:02:35.019> and<00:02:35.349> you<00:02:36.250> let<00:02:36.430> go<00:02:36.640> of<00:02:36.849> the

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
straight like so and you let go of the

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.330 
straight like so and you let go of the
lever<00:02:37.239> once<00:02:37.569> it's<00:02:37.750> all<00:02:38.019> the<00:02:38.170> way<00:02:38.260> in<00:02:38.409> so<00:02:38.620> you

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
lever once it's all the way in so you

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.270 
lever once it's all the way in so you
know<00:02:39.640> that<00:02:39.879> it's<00:02:40.000> put<00:02:40.239> in<00:02:40.359> properly<00:02:41.069> when<00:02:42.069> this

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
know that it's put in properly when this

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.429 
know that it's put in properly when this
stem<00:02:42.519> is<00:02:42.730> pointing<00:02:43.180> up<00:02:43.299> towards<00:02:43.989> the<00:02:44.230> space

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:44.439 
stem is pointing up towards the space

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:46.440 
stem is pointing up towards the space
and<00:02:44.739> you<00:02:45.310> wiggle<00:02:45.640> it<00:02:45.760> it<00:02:45.879> doesn't<00:02:46.030> go<00:02:46.209> anywhere

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
and you wiggle it it doesn't go anywhere

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.890 
and you wiggle it it doesn't go anywhere
so<00:02:47.409> for<00:02:47.620> example<00:02:48.540> if<00:02:49.540> it<00:02:49.780> looks<00:02:49.959> like<00:02:50.200> this

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
so for example if it looks like this

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.190 
so for example if it looks like this
it's<00:02:52.900> not<00:02:53.079> right<00:02:53.349> it's<00:02:54.220> incorrect<00:02:54.870> so<00:02:55.870> it<00:02:56.019> has

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
it's not right it's incorrect so it has

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.509 
it's not right it's incorrect so it has
to<00:02:56.500> be<00:02:56.819> all<00:02:57.819> the<00:02:58.180> way<00:02:58.299> inside<00:02:59.190> so<00:03:00.190> our<00:03:00.340> last

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
to be all the way inside so our last

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.869 
to be all the way inside so our last
step<00:03:00.849> is<00:03:01.180> to<00:03:01.329> get<00:03:01.599> this<00:03:01.810> thread<00:03:02.139> up<00:03:02.379> top<00:03:02.739> and<00:03:03.099> we

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
step is to get this thread up top and we

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:06.110 
step is to get this thread up top and we
do<00:03:04.060> that<00:03:04.269> by<00:03:04.959> taking<00:03:04.989> the<00:03:05.409> hand<00:03:05.620> wheel

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
do that by taking the hand wheel

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.509 
do that by taking the hand wheel
rotating<00:03:07.120> towards<00:03:07.569> ourselves<00:03:08.190> and<00:03:09.190> you<00:03:09.370> see

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
rotating towards ourselves and you see

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.300 
rotating towards ourselves and you see
the<00:03:09.639> needle<00:03:09.879> goes<00:03:10.030> down<00:03:10.299> and<00:03:10.859> all<00:03:11.859> the<00:03:11.980> way<00:03:12.099> up

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
the needle goes down and all the way up

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.330 
the needle goes down and all the way up
and<00:03:12.700> you<00:03:13.510> see<00:03:13.780> right<00:03:14.260> there<00:03:14.319> the<00:03:14.980> thread<00:03:15.220> is

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
and you see right there the thread is

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.180 
and you see right there the thread is
coming<00:03:15.579> across<00:03:16.500> once<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:17.680> needles<00:03:17.949> all<00:03:18.099> the

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
coming across once the needles all the

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.170 
coming across once the needles all the
way<00:03:18.250> up<00:03:18.340> at<00:03:18.430> the<00:03:18.459> top<00:03:18.699> and<00:03:18.730> that<00:03:18.940> has<00:03:19.030> happened

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
way up at the top and that has happened

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.640 
way up at the top and that has happened
you're<00:03:19.480> gonna<00:03:19.599> pull<00:03:20.280> on<00:03:21.280> that<00:03:21.579> thread<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:23.470> top

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
you're gonna pull on that thread the top

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.170 
you're gonna pull on that thread the top
thread<00:03:23.919> and<00:03:24.340> that'll<00:03:24.609> bring<00:03:24.730> the<00:03:24.879> bobbin

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
thread and that'll bring the bobbin

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.349 
thread and that'll bring the bobbin
thread<00:03:25.209> up<00:03:25.569> and<00:03:26.019> what<00:03:26.799> you<00:03:26.980> can<00:03:27.190> do<00:03:27.400> is<00:03:27.730> if<00:03:28.209> you

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
thread up and what you can do is if you

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:30.449 
thread up and what you can do is if you
can't<00:03:28.629> reach<00:03:28.810> it<00:03:28.959> with<00:03:28.989> your<00:03:29.169> fingers<00:03:29.530> you<00:03:30.280> can

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
can't reach it with your fingers you can

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:31.830 
can't reach it with your fingers you can
sweep<00:03:30.760> with<00:03:31.090> a<00:03:31.120> pair<00:03:31.329> of<00:03:31.359> scissors<00:03:31.540> underneath

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
sweep with a pair of scissors underneath

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.229 
sweep with a pair of scissors underneath
the<00:03:32.379> presser<00:03:32.530> foot<00:03:32.889> and<00:03:33.310> then<00:03:33.849> your<00:03:34.000> final

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
the presser foot and then your final

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.800 
the presser foot and then your final
step<00:03:34.569> is<00:03:35.139> to<00:03:35.319> take<00:03:35.470> those<00:03:35.769> threads<00:03:36.660> put<00:03:37.660> them

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
step is to take those threads put them

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.550 
step is to take those threads put them
underneath<00:03:38.109> and<00:03:38.590> behind<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:39.910> presser<00:03:40.239> foot

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
underneath and behind the presser foot

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.589 
underneath and behind the presser foot
you<00:03:41.560> put<00:03:41.769> your<00:03:41.949> cover<00:03:42.819> on<00:03:43.030> and<00:03:43.299> you're<00:03:43.449> ready

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 
you put your cover on and you're ready

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.930 
you put your cover on and you're ready
to<00:03:43.750> sell
