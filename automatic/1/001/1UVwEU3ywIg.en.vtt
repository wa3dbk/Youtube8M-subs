00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:55.870
 You can count. 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:03:00.400
 When you perform a personnel job while keeping a clear affinity to keep shooting 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:06.780
 This is the key to securing. 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.780
 It is better to have a habit of making the other person's words rather than 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:16.880
 As the recent interest in hiring and employment hotter than ever in the global HR 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:21.260
 Interest and popularity is growing even more.

 It's really cheap, or you do not even have a cup of coffee 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:09.000
 I heard you are a group of practitioners and the free house 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:10.260

 I hold out a lot of things you'll get to go to great lengths 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:28.500
 The job of HR is to provide more opportunities than to build up qualifications or expertise. 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:33.570

 Unlike other duties, HR duties are based on 4 employees 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:51.930
 It's a job with a unique charm. 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:57.390
 Lee Sang-deok said that the HR function is to manage the nearest person 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:05:00.570
