00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.680
 how you did it will always be one 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.300
 riddle remain just one of the hard ones 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.820
 discs and actually one of the 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.700
 partitions that you always explore in you 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.410
 suddenly there is no longer happy 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.840
 the partition and then to this is 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.789
 no longer visible in this likes how 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.800
 see how you can make partitions visible 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.210
 and how you free up space for it 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.680
 a new partition 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.769
 i show it and windows may 8 at 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.269
 windows 7 works the same way 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.790
 I moved the mouse pointer to the 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.600
 bottom left corner the windows button 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.030
 appears 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.750
 I right click on this 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.989
 and choose 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.989
 disk management 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.190
 the window will be in the desktop 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.530
 views of windows 8 opened for the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.820
 For clarity, I enlarge the window 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.710
 you see an overview of the 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.469
 available letter including the 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.230
 CD-ROM drive 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.289
 you can see that this disk is in partitions 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.910
 distributed of equal size 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.859
 and of course the partitions are the 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.120
 letters that you explore 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.610
 as different disks 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.320
 shown in this case are with the 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.670
 partitions of a station sluts 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.200
 to provide 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.439
 if the letter is missing, the 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.030
 partition not shown in the explorer 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.729
 if you right-click on one 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.560
 partition you can choose 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.560
 change drive letter and paths 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.200
 this partition has d as the drive letter 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.830
 if the letter is missing you can click on this 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.659
 add way and drive letter 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.080
 in this case it can not do anything because the 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.530
 letter has already been assigned but if I choose 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.899
 in front of 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.929
 change where it's the same way 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.520
 you can work another letter 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:47.009
 choose 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.450
 fit this on shortcuts and 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.670
 other references to this 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.819
 drive letter will of course not work 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.819
 more 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:01.540
 if you want the size of the partition 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.540
 adjust choose decrease volume 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.480
 you do this if you have a new partition 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.880
 want to make because for that you need one 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:11.950
 free up space 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.950
 I'll reduce this by 1000 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.930
 and you see that one is not assigned 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.700
 partition has been added 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.980
 if you right click on this 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.659
 you can click this partition to one 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:32.420
 assign drive letter 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:36.010
 this way but I cancel because I 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.010
 want to delete this partition 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.540
 I do that through this option in my d 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:45.379
 to choose a partition 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.450
 Increase volume and thus ensure 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:50.860
 that all available space again 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.860
 this partition is used 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.510
 you can see it is 2 party again 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.920
 c as far as this keeps how 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.920
 partitions in windows 8
