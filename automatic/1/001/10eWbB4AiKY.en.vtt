video<00:00:08.340> talks<00:00:08.760> about<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.809> attenuation<00:00:10.410> and

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
video talks about the attenuation and

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.610 
video talks about the attenuation and
absorption<00:00:11.460> of<00:00:11.670> x-rays<00:00:12.059> once<00:00:12.630> they<00:00:12.929> penetrate

absorption of x-rays once they penetrate
tissue<00:00:14.099> in<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.790> body<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.509> that's<00:00:16.170> all<00:00:16.320> going

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
tissue in the body and that's all going

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.820 
tissue in the body and that's all going
to<00:00:16.590> talk<00:00:16.740> about<00:00:16.949> so<00:00:17.190> let's<00:00:17.220> go<00:00:17.520> going<00:00:18.650> okay

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
to talk about so let's go going okay

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.650 
to talk about so let's go going okay
it's<00:00:20.279> worth<00:00:20.460> just<00:00:20.580> spending<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.240> little<00:00:21.359> minute

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
it's worth just spending a little minute

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.390 
it's worth just spending a little minute
talking<00:00:21.990> about<00:00:22.170> this<00:00:22.289> word<00:00:22.500> attenuation<00:00:23.220> and

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
talking about this word attenuation and

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.720 
talking about this word attenuation and
what<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:23.609> means<00:00:23.960> attenuation<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:25.109> effectively

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
what it means attenuation is effectively

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.250 
what it means attenuation is effectively
jet<00:00:26.730> in<00:00:26.910> general<00:00:27.300> it's<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.599> opposite<00:00:28.109> of

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
jet in general it's the opposite of

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.650 
jet in general it's the opposite of
amplification<00:00:28.740> so<00:00:29.400> it's<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.939> decrease<00:00:30.840> in

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
amplification so it's a decrease in

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.190 
amplification so it's a decrease in
amplitude<00:00:33.660> or<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.649> decrease<00:00:35.460> in<00:00:35.489> intensity

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
amplitude or a decrease in intensity

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.440 
amplitude or a decrease in intensity
okay<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:37.260> we<00:00:37.890> can<00:00:38.070> see<00:00:38.280> here<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.879> says<00:00:38.910> the

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
okay so we can see here that it says the

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.240 
okay so we can see here that it says the
attenuation<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.230> gradual<00:00:40.649> decrease<00:00:41.100> in

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
attenuation is the gradual decrease in

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.590 
attenuation is the gradual decrease in
energy<00:00:42.120> as<00:00:42.410> the<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.800> X<00:00:43.950> rays<00:00:44.190> enter<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.270> pass

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
energy as the the X rays enter and pass

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.959 
energy as the the X rays enter and pass
through<00:00:45.870> any<00:00:46.200> absorbing<00:00:47.039> material<00:00:47.550> and

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
through any absorbing material and

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.430 
through any absorbing material and
obviously<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.450> absorbing<00:00:48.870> material<00:00:49.320> that

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
obviously the absorbing material that

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.090 
obviously the absorbing material that
we're<00:00:49.649> interested<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.550> tissue<00:00:51.530> so<00:00:52.530> the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
we're interested in is tissue so the

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.400 
we're interested in is tissue so the
actual<00:00:53.640> quantity<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.629> we<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:55.260> we're

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
actual quantity that we that we're

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.630 
actual quantity that we that we're
interested<00:00:55.649> in<00:00:55.949> when<00:00:56.129> we're<00:00:56.280> talking<00:00:56.399> about

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
interested in when we're talking about

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.819 
interested in when we're talking about
attenuation<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.600> what<00:00:57.899> we<00:00:58.020> call<00:00:58.260> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
attenuation is what we call the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.229 
attenuation is what we call the
intensity<00:00:59.719> the<00:01:00.719> intensity<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:02.820> X<00:01:02.969> rays

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
intensity the intensity of the X rays

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.539 
intensity the intensity of the X rays
now<00:01:03.960> if<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.199> remember<00:01:04.530> from<00:01:04.680> your<00:01:04.979> unit<00:01:05.339> two

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
now if you remember from your unit two

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.250 
now if you remember from your unit two
studies<00:01:05.970> you're<00:01:06.150> g48<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.810> you'll<00:01:07.049> remember

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
studies you're g48 to you'll remember

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.530 
studies you're g48 to you'll remember
that<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.740> intensity<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.549> defined<00:01:09.060> as<00:01:09.450> the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
that the intensity is defined as the

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.530 
that the intensity is defined as the
power<00:01:09.810> per<00:01:10.560> unit<00:01:11.159> cross<00:01:11.460> sectional<00:01:12.000> area

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
power per unit cross sectional area

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.249 
power per unit cross sectional area
alright<00:01:13.470> or<00:01:13.710> here<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:15.000> equal<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.630> P<00:01:15.900> which<00:01:16.200> is

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
alright or here I is equal to P which is

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.219 
alright or here I is equal to P which is
the<00:01:16.470> power<00:01:16.759> divided<00:01:17.759> by<00:01:17.930> unit<00:01:18.930> cross

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
the power divided by unit cross

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.820 
the power divided by unit cross
sectional<00:01:19.680> area<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:21.110> okay<00:01:22.110> now<00:01:22.710> obviously

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
sectional area a okay now obviously

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.670 
sectional area a okay now obviously
power<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.580> measured<00:01:23.759> in<00:01:24.000> what<00:01:24.180> an<00:01:24.500> area<00:01:25.500> is

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
power is measured in what an area is

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.170 
power is measured in what an area is
measured<00:01:26.040> in<00:01:26.159> meter<00:01:26.490> squared<00:01:26.880> so<00:01:26.970> I've

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
measured in meter squared so I've

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.330 
measured in meter squared so I've
effectively<00:01:27.750> got<00:01:27.930> watts<00:01:28.350> per<00:01:28.650> meter<00:01:28.950> squared

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
effectively got watts per meter squared

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.210 
effectively got watts per meter squared
and<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:30.180> SI<00:01:30.450> unit<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:30.990> intensity<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.799> indeed

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
and the SI unit of intensity is indeed

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.780 
and the SI unit of intensity is indeed
watts<00:01:33.150> per<00:01:33.600> meter<00:01:34.140> squared<00:01:34.590> all<00:01:35.460> right<00:01:35.610> so

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
watts per meter squared all right so

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.490 
watts per meter squared all right so
this<00:01:35.939> is<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.270> quantity<00:01:36.479> we're<00:01:36.930> interested<00:01:37.409> in

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
this is the quantity we're interested in

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.260 
this is the quantity we're interested in
and<00:01:37.770> if<00:01:38.280> you're<00:01:38.400> not<00:01:38.610> familiar<00:01:38.939> with

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
and if you're not familiar with

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.420 
and if you're not familiar with
intensity<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:40.530> need<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.740> go<00:01:40.890> back<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.250> have<00:01:41.369> a

remember what's going on with intensity
all<00:01:48.509> right<00:01:48.659> but<00:01:48.810> it's<00:01:48.930> just<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.229> power<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.770> the

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
all right but it's just the power I the

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.460 
all right but it's just the power I the

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
back though all right well it's an

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.430 
back though all right well it's an
exponential<00:02:08.280> decay<00:02:08.780> effectively<00:02:09.780> all<00:02:10.259> right

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
exponential decay effectively all right

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.440 
exponential decay effectively all right
so<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.830> intensity<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.580> X<00:02:11.730> rays<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.209> power

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
so the intensity of the X rays the power

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.850 
so the intensity of the X rays the power
per<00:02:12.900> square<00:02:13.230> meter

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
per square meter

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.480 
per square meter
x-rays<00:02:14.220> will<00:02:15.030> decrease<00:02:15.810> exponentially<00:02:16.590> as<00:02:17.010> it

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
x-rays will decrease exponentially as it

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.140 
x-rays will decrease exponentially as it
enters<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.180> passes<00:02:18.960> through<00:02:19.200> tissue<00:02:20.150> all

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.470 
enters and passes through tissue all
right

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
right

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.940

and<00:02:22.470> as<00:02:22.680> exponential<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:24.570> the<00:02:25.350> intensity

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950

at any given thickness X which is this I

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.180 
at any given thickness X which is this I
here<00:02:29.370> is<00:02:29.720> equal<00:02:30.720> to<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.990> initial<00:02:31.500> intensity

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
here is equal to the initial intensity

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.920 
here is equal to the initial intensity
by<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.580> intensity<00:02:33.180> arriving<00:02:33.960> at<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.350> surface

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
by the intensity arriving at the surface

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:48.350 
by the intensity arriving at the surface
arriving<00:02:36.930> at<00:02:41.600> surface<00:02:42.830> of<00:02:43.830> tissue<00:02:47.360> right

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
arriving at surface of tissue right

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.330 
arriving at surface of tissue right
multiplied<00:02:49.200> by<00:02:49.440> this<00:02:49.500> exponential<00:02:50.160> decay

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
multiplied by this exponential decay

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.760 
multiplied by this exponential decay
factor<00:02:50.850> all<00:02:51.750> right<00:02:51.900> so<00:02:52.080> we<00:02:52.170> get<00:02:52.260> e<00:02:52.440> to<00:02:52.530> the

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
factor all right so we get e to the

power<00:02:52.950> minus<00:02:53.520> and<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:54.000> minus<00:02:54.030> denotes<00:02:54.690> that

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
power minus and the minus denotes that

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.410 
power minus and the minus denotes that
it's<00:02:55.080> exponential<00:02:55.709> decay<00:02:56.100> and<00:02:56.760> then<00:02:57.330> this

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
it's exponential decay and then this

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.110 
it's exponential decay and then this
quantity<00:02:57.630> mu<00:02:58.260> all<00:02:58.830> right<00:02:59.040> now<00:02:59.250> mu<00:02:59.580> is<00:02:59.880> the

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
quantity mu all right now mu is the

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.699 
quantity mu all right now mu is the
absorption<00:03:00.480> coefficient<00:03:00.840> which<00:03:01.350> we'll<00:03:01.560> talk

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709

about in a minute and X is the thickness

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.490 
about in a minute and X is the thickness
of<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.190> material<00:03:05.280> ie<00:03:05.940> how<00:03:06.540> much<00:03:06.930> depth<00:03:07.290> is

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
of the material ie how much depth is

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.949 
of the material ie how much depth is
penetrated<00:03:08.220> so<00:03:08.550> if<00:03:09.030> that's<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.300> surface<00:03:09.570> of

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
penetrated so if that's the surface of

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.460 
penetrated so if that's the surface of
your<00:03:10.770> tissue<00:03:11.760> for<00:03:12.090> example<00:03:12.510> and<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:13.110> x<00:03:13.260> rays

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
your tissue for example and the x rays

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.710 
your tissue for example and the x rays
are<00:03:13.650> incident<00:03:13.709> in<00:03:14.190> this<00:03:14.400> direction<00:03:14.910> this

distance<00:03:16.500> here<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:18.000> thickness<00:03:18.299> or<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:18.780> depth

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
distance here the thickness or the depth

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.090 
distance here the thickness or the depth
of<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.560> tissue<00:03:19.799> is<00:03:20.580> called<00:03:21.060> X<00:03:21.799> okay<00:03:22.799> and

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.610 
of the tissue is called X okay and
that's<00:03:23.280> this<00:03:23.549> one<00:03:23.760> in<00:03:24.000> in<00:03:24.390> this<00:03:24.620> exponential

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
that's this one in in this exponential

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.460 
that's this one in in this exponential
decay<00:03:25.769> equation<00:03:26.489> here<00:03:26.959> all<00:03:27.959> right<00:03:28.140> so<00:03:28.350> the

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
decay equation here all right so the

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.850 
decay equation here all right so the
intensity<00:03:28.830> any<00:03:29.250> given<00:03:29.580> depth<00:03:29.850> is<00:03:30.230> equal<00:03:31.230> to

intensity any given depth is equal to

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.380 
intensity any given depth is equal to
the<00:03:31.980> initial<00:03:32.130> intensity<00:03:32.760> arriving<00:03:33.239> at<00:03:33.330> the

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
the initial intensity arriving at the

the initial intensity arriving at the
surface<00:03:33.720> of<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:33.870> tissue<00:03:34.340> multiplied<00:03:35.340> by<00:03:35.790> this

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
surface of the tissue multiplied by this

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.350 
surface of the tissue multiplied by this
factor<00:03:36.390> here<00:03:37.010> now<00:03:38.010> we<00:03:38.070> need<00:03:38.400> to<00:03:38.519> talk<00:03:38.670> a<00:03:38.700> little

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
factor here now we need to talk a little

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.000 
factor here now we need to talk a little
bit<00:03:39.600> more<00:03:39.720> depth<00:03:39.959> about<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.560> absorption

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
bit more depth about the absorption

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.150 
bit more depth about the absorption
coefficient<00:03:41.840> all<00:03:42.840> right<00:03:43.080> so<00:03:43.739> the<00:03:43.890> absorption

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
coefficient all right so the absorption

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.940 
coefficient all right so the absorption
coefficient<00:03:44.780> effectively<00:03:45.780> is<00:03:45.959> how<00:03:46.200> well<00:03:46.590> or

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
coefficient effectively is how well or

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.610 
coefficient effectively is how well or
how<00:03:47.010> poorly<00:03:47.280> a<00:03:48.090> certain<00:03:49.019> type<00:03:49.230> of<00:03:49.260> tissue

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
how poorly a certain type of tissue

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.660 
how poorly a certain type of tissue
absorbs<00:03:50.280> x-rays<00:03:51.080> all<00:03:52.080> right<00:03:52.230> so<00:03:52.650> any<00:03:52.980> best

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
absorbs x-rays all right so any best

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.250 
absorbs x-rays all right so any best
explained<00:03:54.090> I<00:03:54.180> think<00:03:54.209> from<00:03:54.570> this<00:03:54.720> little<00:03:54.870> graph

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
explained I think from this little graph

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.410 
explained I think from this little graph
here<00:03:55.290> so<00:03:55.769> this<00:03:56.340> is<00:03:56.519> the<00:03:56.549> distance<00:03:57.030> that<00:03:57.180> the

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
here so this is the distance that the

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.240 
here so this is the distance that the
x-rays<00:03:57.750> are<00:03:57.870> traveling<00:03:58.290> into<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:58.650> tissue<00:03:58.890> ie

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
x-rays are traveling into the tissue ie

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.759 
x-rays are traveling into the tissue ie
how<00:03:59.610> far<00:03:59.970> they've<00:04:00.150> penetrated<00:04:00.360> and<00:04:01.019> this<00:04:01.620> is

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
how far they've penetrated and this is

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.800 
how far they've penetrated and this is
the<00:04:01.890> intensity<00:04:02.400> of<00:04:02.549> the<00:04:02.640> x-rays<00:04:03.120> at<00:04:03.420> that

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
the intensity of the x-rays at that

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.190 
the intensity of the x-rays at that
depth<00:04:04.170> okay<00:04:04.920> so<00:04:04.980> as<00:04:05.160> you<00:04:05.220> can<00:04:05.310> see<00:04:05.430> air<00:04:06.200> doesn't

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
depth okay so as you can see air doesn't

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.199 
depth okay so as you can see air doesn't
really<00:04:07.440> absorb<00:04:07.799> x-rays<00:04:08.340> at<00:04:08.580> all<00:04:08.790> but<00:04:08.940> as<00:04:09.030> soon

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
really absorb x-rays at all but as soon

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.479 
really absorb x-rays at all but as soon
as<00:04:09.299> it<00:04:09.390> enters<00:04:09.660> the<00:04:09.780> body<00:04:10.070> in<00:04:11.070> soft<00:04:11.400> tissue

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
as it enters the body in soft tissue

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.850 
as it enters the body in soft tissue
such<00:04:11.940> as<00:04:11.970> flesh<00:04:12.450> the<00:04:12.989> intensity<00:04:13.530> will

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
such as flesh the intensity will

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.120 
such as flesh the intensity will
decrease<00:04:14.340> in<00:04:14.700> this<00:04:14.970> fashion<00:04:15.380> right<00:04:16.410> whereas

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
decrease in this fashion right whereas

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.539 
decrease in this fashion right whereas
in<00:04:17.250> bone<00:04:18.169> the<00:04:19.169> intensity<00:04:19.680> of<00:04:19.859> the<00:04:19.950> x-rays<00:04:20.340> will

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
in bone the intensity of the x-rays will

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.880 
in bone the intensity of the x-rays will
decrease<00:04:20.910> much<00:04:21.180> quicker<00:04:21.510> with<00:04:21.750> distance<00:04:22.200> all

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
decrease much quicker with distance all

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.140 
decrease much quicker with distance all
right<00:04:22.950> and<00:04:23.250> that's<00:04:23.400> what<00:04:23.580> we<00:04:23.700> want<00:04:23.940> really

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
right and that's what we want really

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.760 
right and that's what we want really
because<00:04:24.479> we<00:04:24.599> want<00:04:24.810> to<00:04:24.960> see<00:04:25.200> a<00:04:25.229> difference

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
because we want to see a difference

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:26.690 
because we want to see a difference
between

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
between

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.660 
between
soft<00:04:27.000> tissues<00:04:27.450> and<00:04:27.660> bone<00:04:28.260> alright<00:04:29.040> so<00:04:29.250> we<00:04:29.430> need

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
soft tissues and bone alright so we need

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.300 
soft tissues and bone alright so we need
at<00:04:30.000> any<00:04:30.240> given<00:04:30.540> distance<00:04:30.990> X<00:04:31.290> we<00:04:31.560> need<00:04:31.980> a

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
at any given distance X we need a

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.580 
at any given distance X we need a
difference<00:04:33.060> in<00:04:33.210> the<00:04:33.330> intensity<00:04:33.750> and

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
difference in the intensity and

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.770 
difference in the intensity and
obviously<00:04:34.950> that<00:04:35.400> that<00:04:35.610> will<00:04:35.970> show<00:04:36.480> up<00:04:36.630> as

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
obviously that that will show up as

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.480 
obviously that that will show up as
different<00:04:36.960> shades<00:04:37.380> on<00:04:37.710> on<00:04:37.980> the<00:04:38.130> x-ray

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
different shades on on the x-ray

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.090 
different shades on on the x-ray

alright<00:04:41.100> so<00:04:41.820> bone<00:04:42.510> is<00:04:42.690> a<00:04:42.720> better<00:04:43.020> absorbs

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
alright so bone is a better absorbs

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.950 
alright so bone is a better absorbs
absorber<00:04:44.190> of<00:04:44.220> x-rays<00:04:44.640> the<00:04:45.270> decay<00:04:45.630> is<00:04:45.690> much

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
absorber of x-rays the decay is much

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.430 
absorber of x-rays the decay is much
quicker<00:04:46.230> and<00:04:46.590> therefore<00:04:47.520> it<00:04:47.730> has<00:04:47.970> a<00:04:48.000> higher

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
quicker and therefore it has a higher

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.110 
quicker and therefore it has a higher
absorption<00:04:49.440> coefficient<00:04:50.250> alright<00:04:50.670> so

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
absorption coefficient alright so

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.460 
absorption coefficient alright so
something<00:04:51.360> with<00:04:51.570> a<00:04:51.630> higher<00:04:51.870> absorption

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
something with a higher absorption

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.440 
something with a higher absorption
coefficient<00:04:53.040> mu<00:04:53.190> means<00:04:53.850> it's<00:04:54.030> a<00:04:54.120> better

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
coefficient mu means it's a better

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.380 
coefficient mu means it's a better
absorber<00:04:55.170> of<00:04:55.320> x-rays<00:04:55.890> it's<00:04:56.820> not<00:04:56.940> quite<00:04:57.210> as

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
absorber of x-rays it's not quite as

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.090 
absorber of x-rays it's not quite as
simple<00:04:57.540> as<00:04:57.720> that<00:04:57.810> because<00:04:58.020> it<00:04:58.290> also<00:04:58.440> depends

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
simple as that because it also depends

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.760 
simple as that because it also depends
on<00:04:59.130> the<00:04:59.760> energy<00:05:00.000> of<00:05:00.510> the<00:05:00.810> incident<00:05:01.050> x-ray

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
on the energy of the incident x-ray

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.620 
on the energy of the incident x-ray
photons<00:05:02.280> right<00:05:02.940> and<00:05:03.090> we'll<00:05:03.180> have<00:05:03.300> a<00:05:03.330> look<00:05:03.480> at

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
photons right and we'll have a look at

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.680 
photons right and we'll have a look at
how<00:05:03.750> that<00:05:03.810> works<00:05:04.140> in<00:05:04.350> a<00:05:04.380> minute<00:05:04.820> now<00:05:05.820> the<00:05:06.210> unit

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
how that works in a minute now the unit

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.630 
how that works in a minute now the unit
of<00:05:06.900> the<00:05:07.470> intent<00:05:07.950> the<00:05:08.130> attenuation

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
of the intent the attenuation

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.830 
of the intent the attenuation
coefficient<00:05:09.330> is<00:05:09.450> per<00:05:09.960> meter<00:05:10.010> all<00:05:11.010> right<00:05:11.840> just

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
coefficient is per meter all right just

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.640 
coefficient is per meter all right just
meters<00:05:13.170> to<00:05:13.260> the<00:05:13.320> minus<00:05:13.680> one<00:05:15.020> okay<00:05:16.050> now<00:05:16.470> we<00:05:16.530> go

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
meters to the minus one okay now we go

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:17.960 
meters to the minus one okay now we go
back<00:05:16.680> a<00:05:16.860> little<00:05:16.980> bit<00:05:17.160> we<00:05:17.400> skipped<00:05:17.640> over<00:05:17.820> this

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
back a little bit we skipped over this

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.580 
back a little bit we skipped over this
question<00:05:18.240> basically<00:05:18.900> because<00:05:19.170> it<00:05:19.290> was<00:05:19.380> in<00:05:19.500> the

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
question basically because it was in the

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.610 
question basically because it was in the
wrong<00:05:19.680> place<00:05:19.740> in<00:05:20.300> your<00:05:21.300> slides<00:05:21.630> so<00:05:22.410> there's<00:05:22.590> a

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
wrong place in your slides so there's a

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.410 
wrong place in your slides so there's a
little<00:05:22.830> question<00:05:23.220> here<00:05:23.520> that<00:05:23.670> you<00:05:24.090> can<00:05:24.240> have<00:05:24.390> a

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.420 
little question here that you can have a

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.770 
little question here that you can have a
go<00:05:24.630> at<00:05:24.810> and<00:05:25.100> if<00:05:26.100> you<00:05:26.220> pause<00:05:26.520> the<00:05:27.270> video<00:05:27.480> for<00:05:27.540> a

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
go at and if you pause the video for a

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.270 
go at and if you pause the video for a
moment<00:05:27.870> while<00:05:28.170> you<00:05:28.200> do<00:05:28.440> that<00:05:28.470> and<00:05:28.800> then<00:05:29.190> if

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
moment while you do that and then if

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.860 
moment while you do that and then if
you've<00:05:29.400> got<00:05:29.520> any<00:05:29.700> problems<00:05:29.760> we'll<00:05:30.360> go<00:05:30.600> through

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
you've got any problems we'll go through

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:41.589 
you've got any problems we'll go through
it<00:05:31.020> in<00:05:31.380> lesson

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:41.599 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:47.029 

okay<00:05:42.599> so<00:05:43.319> here<00:05:43.949> are<00:05:44.219> some<00:05:44.459> typical<00:05:46.039> absorption

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 
okay so here are some typical absorption

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:48.829 
okay so here are some typical absorption
coefficients<00:05:47.639> for<00:05:47.789> bone<00:05:47.969> and<00:05:48.300> muscle<00:05:48.479> and

00:05:48.829 --> 00:05:48.839 
coefficients for bone and muscle and

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:51.350 
coefficients for bone and muscle and
this<00:05:49.769> is<00:05:49.979> quite<00:05:50.159> interesting<00:05:50.639> because<00:05:50.759> you

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
this is quite interesting because you

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.269 
this is quite interesting because you
can<00:05:51.539> see<00:05:51.599> how<00:05:52.080> it<00:05:52.259> depends<00:05:52.679> on<00:05:52.769> the<00:05:52.889> energy<00:05:53.249> of

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:53.279 
can see how it depends on the energy of

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:55.939 
can see how it depends on the energy of
the<00:05:53.429> x-rays<00:05:53.569> so<00:05:54.569> up<00:05:55.050> here<00:05:55.379> we've<00:05:55.529> got<00:05:55.619> very

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:55.949 
the x-rays so up here we've got very

00:05:55.949 --> 00:06:00.259 
the x-rays so up here we've got very
very<00:05:56.219> high<00:05:56.669> energy<00:05:57.419> very<00:05:58.759> high<00:05:59.759> frequency

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:00.269 
very high energy very high frequency

00:06:00.269 --> 00:06:03.079 
very high energy very high frequency
x-rays<00:06:00.569> four<00:06:01.110> mega<00:06:01.469> electron<00:06:01.649> volts<00:06:02.339> then

00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:03.089 
x-rays four mega electron volts then

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:05.059 
x-rays four mega electron volts then
that's<00:06:03.300> pretty<00:06:03.449> much<00:06:03.569> the<00:06:03.839> highest<00:06:04.259> we<00:06:04.439> can<00:06:04.679> we

00:06:05.059 --> 00:06:05.069 
that's pretty much the highest we can we

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:07.699 
that's pretty much the highest we can we
can<00:06:05.279> produce<00:06:05.519> in<00:06:05.909> in<00:06:06.119> x-ray<00:06:06.479> tube<00:06:06.749> going<00:06:07.439> all

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:07.709 
can produce in in x-ray tube going all

00:06:07.709 --> 00:06:10.759 
can produce in in x-ray tube going all
the<00:06:07.800> way<00:06:07.830> down<00:06:07.919> to<00:06:08.339> about<00:06:08.550> 50<00:06:09.029> ke<00:06:09.300> V<00:06:09.809> and<00:06:10.050> you

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:10.769 
the way down to about 50 ke V and you

00:06:10.769 --> 00:06:14.899 
the way down to about 50 ke V and you
can<00:06:10.949> see<00:06:11.189> that<00:06:11.669> as<00:06:11.819> the<00:06:11.999> x-ray<00:06:12.689> energies<00:06:13.909> go

00:06:14.899 --> 00:06:14.909 
can see that as the x-ray energies go

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:19.129 
can see that as the x-ray energies go
down<00:06:15.289> the<00:06:16.639> absorption<00:06:17.719> coefficients<00:06:18.719> for

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:19.139 
down the absorption coefficients for

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:23.209 
down the absorption coefficients for
bone<00:06:19.409> and<00:06:19.709> for<00:06:20.159> muscle<00:06:20.519> both<00:06:21.029> increase<00:06:22.039> okay

00:06:23.209 --> 00:06:23.219 
bone and for muscle both increase okay

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:26.509 
bone and for muscle both increase okay
so<00:06:23.699> low<00:06:24.240> energy<00:06:24.389> x-rays<00:06:25.110> both<00:06:26.039> bone<00:06:26.339> and

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:26.519 
so low energy x-rays both bone and

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:29.179 
so low energy x-rays both bone and
muscle<00:06:26.669> is<00:06:27.089> better<00:06:27.539> at<00:06:27.899> absorbing<00:06:28.019> x-rays<00:06:28.889> ie

00:06:29.179 --> 00:06:29.189 
muscle is better at absorbing x-rays ie

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:32.059 
muscle is better at absorbing x-rays ie
it<00:06:29.550> absorbs<00:06:29.999> low<00:06:30.419> energy<00:06:30.749> x-rays<00:06:31.199> much<00:06:31.769> better

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:32.069 
it absorbs low energy x-rays much better

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:34.609 
it absorbs low energy x-rays much better
than<00:06:32.789> it<00:06:32.939> does<00:06:33.089> high-energy<00:06:33.779> x-rays<00:06:34.289> which<00:06:34.499> is

00:06:34.609 --> 00:06:34.619 
than it does high-energy x-rays which is

00:06:34.619 --> 00:06:38.419 
than it does high-energy x-rays which is
kind<00:06:34.829> of<00:06:34.860> what<00:06:35.039> you<00:06:35.129> expect<00:06:36.860> also<00:06:37.860> you<00:06:37.919> can<00:06:38.189> see

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:38.429 
kind of what you expect also you can see

00:06:38.429 --> 00:06:41.059 
kind of what you expect also you can see
that<00:06:38.929> high-energy<00:06:39.929> x-rays<00:06:40.439> the<00:06:40.619> difference

00:06:41.059 --> 00:06:41.069 
that high-energy x-rays the difference

00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:45.829 
that high-energy x-rays the difference
is<00:06:42.169> fairly<00:06:43.169> minimal<00:06:43.909> whereas<00:06:44.909> at<00:06:45.240> very<00:06:45.599> low

00:06:45.829 --> 00:06:45.839 
is fairly minimal whereas at very low

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:48.499 
is fairly minimal whereas at very low
energies<00:06:46.319> bone<00:06:47.009> is<00:06:47.219> very<00:06:47.519> very<00:06:47.879> good<00:06:48.269> at

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:48.509 
energies bone is very very good at

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:50.899 
energies bone is very very good at
absorbing<00:06:48.929> x-rays<00:06:49.559> and<00:06:49.829> therefore<00:06:50.729> you're

00:06:50.899 --> 00:06:50.909 
absorbing x-rays and therefore you're

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:52.850 
absorbing x-rays and therefore you're
going<00:06:51.059> to<00:06:51.209> get<00:06:51.389> quite<00:06:51.659> a<00:06:51.689> large<00:06:52.050> difference<00:06:52.529> in

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:52.860 
going to get quite a large difference in

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.399 
going to get quite a large difference in
contrast<00:06:53.429> here<00:06:53.699> if<00:06:53.879> you<00:06:54.360> leave<00:06:54.659> if<00:06:54.899> you<00:06:55.079> use

00:06:55.399 --> 00:06:55.409 
contrast here if you leave if you use

00:06:55.409 --> 00:06:58.669 
contrast here if you leave if you use
lower<00:06:55.769> energy<00:06:56.429> x-rays<00:06:57.169> okay<00:06:58.169> and<00:06:58.409> you<00:06:58.499> can<00:06:58.619> see

00:06:58.669 --> 00:06:58.679 
lower energy x-rays okay and you can see

00:06:58.679 --> 00:07:01.100 
lower energy x-rays okay and you can see
from<00:06:58.949> this<00:06:59.039> table<00:06:59.249> how<00:06:59.909> those<00:07:00.269> two<00:07:00.539> absorption

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:01.110 
from this table how those two absorption

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:06.589 
from this table how those two absorption
coefficients<00:07:01.709> vary<00:07:01.979> with<00:07:02.789> energy<00:07:03.449> of<00:07:03.629> x-rays
