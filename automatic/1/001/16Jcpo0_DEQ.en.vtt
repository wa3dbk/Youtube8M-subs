00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 and greetings to all swami we are tyrannical 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.040
 continue to build houses with you in 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:11.309
 In the last issue, we built a huge 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.340
 especially the corner by the doctors very much 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.020
 he likes small sizes and guys 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.789
 already the eleventh issue and that means that 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.010
 next issue I will lay out the cards you 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.410
 be able to track with this strictly altitude 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.949
 personally but in this issue I built 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.199
 Here is such a healthy home will give with 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.599
 at first glance it looks like a box but 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.300
 to understand that he is not a box, we need 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.760
 go behind we see that he's already here 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.000
 not at all the box is determined exactly 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.730
 You see them as if you were not 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.420
 sounded but this does not look like yet 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.390
 me dikin house is also large but u 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.260
 we did not speak length because I 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.190
 it just formed here 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.960
 how much space I have it here 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.510
 formed a spare knew what his 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.309
 I decided to build this house like 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.770
 for me it is pretty good out and 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.420
 let's consider it guys i'm here 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.170
 again did not put the lighting not 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.939
 any series 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.549
 all so that when you download 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:13.740
 this house is half done by themselves 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:16.200
 as you see in the house once and about absolutely 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.750
 the walls are absolutely not walls this I decided 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.330
 do because 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:24.450
 dock modern house as they like to call 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.549
 rationality to others I decided why not 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.520
 will turn to extremes for who needs a common 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.770
 the walls I decided to make something like a mountain 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.540
 things like here here 's room 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.430
 a room like this 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.150
 carbon monoxide poisoning on the wall do not even have doors 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.439
 as I have it is even very interesting but 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.380
 Of course I donâ€™t listen to music 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.440
 because it will be heard in the whole house but 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.320
 what kind of music minecraft I have you 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:51.230
 so we also have a way out here 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.000
 managed the pool to the pool and we still 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.790
 back and now let's go on 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.050

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:02.240
 the same house, you see only the absolutely 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:06.020
 undisputed code little color graphics 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:10.660

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.000
 I know that you can do anything here 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.850
 rather big loaders and 1 way out yes 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.550

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.070
 healthy balcony wants interesting and good 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.290
 submitted we have a huge pool 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.140
 the largest pool that builds 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:36.800
 eyes that look at us with this 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:42.590
 you understand the man we have two pool 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:45.470
