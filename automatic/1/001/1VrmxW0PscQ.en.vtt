internet<00:01:11.340> connection<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.909> can<00:01:11.970> shoot<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.750> all

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
internet connection you can shoot it all

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.320 
internet connection you can shoot it all
the<00:01:12.990> way<00:01:13.080> up<00:01:13.189> if<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.250> need<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.790> sort<00:01:15.210> of

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
the way up if you need to sort of

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.880 
the way up if you need to sort of
compromise<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.810> bit<00:01:15.960> because<00:01:16.290> your<00:01:16.590> internet

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
compromise a bit because your internet

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.620 
compromise a bit because your internet
can't<00:01:17.340> handle<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.759> sort<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.060> upload<00:01:18.360> speed

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
can't handle that sort of upload speed

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.179 
can't handle that sort of upload speed
and<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.140> bring<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.439> down<00:01:19.560> somewhere<00:01:19.979> in<00:01:20.040> the

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
and you bring it down somewhere in the

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.710 
and you bring it down somewhere in the
middle<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.729> can<00:01:20.850> also<00:01:20.970> adjust<00:01:21.180> your<00:01:21.509> frame

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
middle you can also adjust your frame

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.350 
middle you can also adjust your frame
rate<00:01:21.890> what<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.009> volume<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.820> your<00:01:24.119> game

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
rate what the volume is of your game

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.940 
rate what the volume is of your game
that<00:01:24.540> you're<00:01:24.659> broadcasting<00:01:24.869> your<00:01:25.439> microphone

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
that you're broadcasting your microphone

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.819 
that you're broadcasting your microphone
volume<00:01:26.869> compression<00:01:27.869> so<00:01:28.200> on<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:28.590> forth

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
volume compression so on and so forth

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.020 
volume compression so on and so forth
and<00:01:28.890> they're<00:01:29.009> also<00:01:29.159> chat<00:01:29.490> settings<00:01:29.880> so

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
and they're also chat settings so

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.789 
and they're also chat settings so
basically<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.540> way<00:01:30.600> this<00:01:30.750> works<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:31.170> that

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
basically the way this works is that

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.580 
basically the way this works is that
when<00:01:31.979> someone<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:33.030> twitch<00:01:33.390> TV<00:01:33.630> chat<00:01:34.020> types<00:01:34.439> a

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
when someone in twitch TV chat types a

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.609 
when someone in twitch TV chat types a
message<00:01:34.920> it'll<00:01:35.400> actually<00:01:35.640> show<00:01:36.119> up<00:01:36.329> as<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.619> chat

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
message it'll actually show up as a chat
