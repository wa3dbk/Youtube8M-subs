in<00:00:00.120> this<00:00:00.989> video<00:00:01.319> I'm<00:00:01.650> going<00:00:01.800> to<00:00:01.890> show<00:00:02.070> you<00:00:02.129> how

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
in this video I'm going to show you how

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.730 
in this video I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:02.399> make<00:00:02.639> miniature<00:00:03.120> water<00:00:03.510> bottles<00:00:03.929> using<00:00:04.440> UV

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
to make miniature water bottles using UV

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:23.770 
to make miniature water bottles using UV
resin

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:23.780 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:29.890 

here's<00:00:24.530> a<00:00:24.650> list<00:00:24.950> of<00:00:25.130> everything<00:00:25.730> I<00:00:25.970> used<00:00:28.869> so<00:00:29.869> I

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
here's a list of everything I used so I

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.200 
here's a list of everything I used so I
started<00:00:30.619> by<00:00:30.770> making<00:00:30.800> these<00:00:31.310> little<00:00:31.849> water

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
started by making these little water

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.270 
started by making these little water
bottles<00:00:32.689> and<00:00:33.020> each<00:00:33.530> one<00:00:33.830> has<00:00:34.130> a<00:00:34.160> different

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
bottles and each one has a different

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.240 
bottles and each one has a different
shape<00:00:34.809> but<00:00:35.809> basically<00:00:36.470> you<00:00:36.710> can<00:00:36.860> just<00:00:37.070> make

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
shape but basically you can just make

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.110 
shape but basically you can just make
any<00:00:37.730> kind<00:00:38.030> that<00:00:38.330> you<00:00:39.140> prefer<00:00:39.860> I<00:00:40.129> want<00:00:40.850> to<00:00:40.970> make

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
any kind that you prefer I want to make

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.720 
any kind that you prefer I want to make
a<00:00:41.330> variety<00:00:41.900> so<00:00:41.930> I<00:00:42.260> started<00:00:42.860> with<00:00:43.040> like<00:00:43.160> a<00:00:43.220> basic

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
a variety so I started with like a basic

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.780 
a variety so I started with like a basic
shape<00:00:44.410> which<00:00:45.410> you<00:00:45.440> can<00:00:45.739> find<00:00:45.980> like<00:00:46.220> in<00:00:46.430> any

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
shape which you can find like in any

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.450 
shape which you can find like in any
grocery<00:00:47.239> store<00:00:47.269> and<00:00:47.750> then<00:00:47.930> I<00:00:48.080> made<00:00:49.010> something

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
grocery store and then I made something

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.490 
grocery store and then I made something
that<00:00:49.640> looks<00:00:49.820> a<00:00:50.180> little<00:00:50.269> more<00:00:50.420> odd<00:00:50.750> like<00:00:51.470> a

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
that looks a little more odd like a

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.939 
that looks a little more odd like a
Pellegrino<00:00:52.010> bottle<00:00:52.730> which<00:00:53.030> is<00:00:53.080> still<00:00:54.080> simple

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
Pellegrino bottle which is still simple

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:00.790 
Pellegrino bottle which is still simple
to<00:00:55.190> make<00:00:55.370> but<00:00:55.580> just<00:00:56.000> a<00:00:56.120> little<00:00:56.360> bit<00:00:56.450> different

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.260 

ok<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:01.860> now<00:01:02.280> we're<00:01:02.550> going<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.730> make<00:01:02.880> the<00:01:03.030> mold

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
ok so now we're going to make the mold

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.149 
ok so now we're going to make the mold
so<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.900> we<00:01:04.019> can<00:01:04.170> make<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.500> little<00:01:04.860> water

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
so that we can make the little water

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.450 
so that we can make the little water
bottles<00:01:05.750> basically<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:06.780> took<00:01:06.930> part<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.950> V<00:01:08.190> of

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
bottles basically I took part a and V of

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.730 
bottles basically I took part a and V of
the<00:01:08.640> mold<00:01:08.850> putty<00:01:09.060> mix<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.630> together<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.350> then

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
the mold putty mix it together and then

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.149 
the mold putty mix it together and then
made<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.810> mold<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.500> little<00:01:13.710> water<00:01:13.920> bottle

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
made a mold of the little water bottle

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.070 
made a mold of the little water bottle
by<00:01:14.460> just<00:01:14.700> pressing<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.180> in<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.630> leaving<00:01:15.960> the

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
by just pressing it in and leaving the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.810 
by just pressing it in and leaving the
back<00:01:16.290> open<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.130> that's<00:01:17.310> where<00:01:17.610> you're<00:01:17.790> going

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
back open and that's where you're going

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.900 
back open and that's where you're going
to<00:01:17.970> pour<00:01:18.270> in<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.540> UV<00:01:19.110> resin<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.740> by<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.670> way

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
to pour in the UV resin and by the way

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.460 
to pour in the UV resin and by the way
UV<00:01:21.509> resin<00:01:21.720> or<00:01:22.229> magic<00:01:22.770> gloss<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.369> by<00:01:24.030> elisa

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
UV resin or magic gloss is by elisa

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.010 
UV resin or magic gloss is by elisa
Pavelka<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.710> it's<00:01:26.580> basically<00:01:27.240> like<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.509> resin

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
Pavelka and it's basically like a resin

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.070 
Pavelka and it's basically like a resin
but<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.530> cures<00:01:29.369> in<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:30.030> sunlight<00:01:30.509> or<00:01:30.780> with<00:01:31.050> a

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
but it cures in the sunlight or with a

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.450 
but it cures in the sunlight or with a
UV<00:01:31.850> light<00:01:32.850> or<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.180> lamp<00:01:33.539> and<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:34.440> cures<00:01:34.860> in<00:01:35.190> about

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
UV light or a lamp and it cures in about

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.080 
UV light or a lamp and it cures in about
30<00:01:35.940> to<00:01:36.180> 45<00:01:36.509> minutes<00:01:36.690> versus<00:01:37.649> regular<00:01:38.280> epoxy

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
30 to 45 minutes versus regular epoxy

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.749 
30 to 45 minutes versus regular epoxy
resin<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.690> takes<00:01:40.350> like<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:41.130> know<00:01:41.250> overnight

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
resin it takes like you know overnight

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.639 
resin it takes like you know overnight
or<00:01:42.090> 12<00:01:42.420> hours<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.050> this<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.890> really<00:01:44.280> quick<00:01:45.649> so

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
or 12 hours and this is really quick so

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.710 
or 12 hours and this is really quick so
where<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:46.979> live<00:01:47.280> there's<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.850> lot<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.330> cloudy

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
where I live there's a lot of cloudy

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.590 
where I live there's a lot of cloudy
days<00:01:49.080> so<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.560> got<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.160> UV<00:01:50.580> lamp<00:01:50.789> so<00:01:51.179> I<00:01:51.210> wouldn't

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
days so I got the UV lamp so I wouldn't

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.109 
days so I got the UV lamp so I wouldn't
have<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.929> wait<00:01:52.770> for<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.220> Sun<00:01:53.429> to<00:01:53.460> come<00:01:53.700> out<00:01:53.820> to

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
have to wait for the Sun to come out to

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.850 
have to wait for the Sun to come out to
be<00:01:54.270> able<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.509> cure<00:01:54.750> these<00:01:54.929> and<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.560> took<00:01:55.740> about

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
be able to cure these and it took about

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.660 
be able to cure these and it took about
45<00:01:56.789> minutes<00:01:57.179> like<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.600> said<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.200> these<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:59.130> mixed

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
45 minutes like I said and these I mixed

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.880 
45 minutes like I said and these I mixed
food<00:01:59.910> coloring<00:02:00.360> in<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:01.050> important<00:02:01.679> thing<00:02:01.860> to

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
food coloring in the important thing to

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.520 
food coloring in the important thing to
remember<00:02:02.520> what<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.210> food<00:02:03.420> coloring<00:02:03.630> is<00:02:03.929> you

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
remember what the food coloring is you

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.529 
remember what the food coloring is you
have<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.890> use<00:02:05.069> a<00:02:05.280> mold<00:02:05.610> that's<00:02:05.789> pretty<00:02:06.209> large

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
have to use a mold that's pretty large

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:08.449 
have to use a mold that's pretty large
so<00:02:07.140> that<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.470> have<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.649> really<00:02:08.099> large<00:02:08.340> amount

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
so that you have a really large amount

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.410 
so that you have a really large amount
of<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.720> UV<00:02:10.140> resin<00:02:10.790> mixed<00:02:11.790> in<00:02:11.940> with<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.209> food

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
of the UV resin mixed in with the food

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.120 
of the UV resin mixed in with the food
coloring<00:02:12.660> because<00:02:13.050> I<00:02:13.080> tried<00:02:13.410> it<00:02:13.590> with<00:02:13.709> smaller

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
coloring because I tried it with smaller

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.510 
coloring because I tried it with smaller
ones<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.700> it<00:02:14.940> didn't<00:02:15.330> cure<00:02:15.660> like<00:02:16.380> it<00:02:16.620> it<00:02:17.160> took

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
ones and it didn't cure like it it took

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.600 
ones and it didn't cure like it it took
like<00:02:18.330> three<00:02:19.140> hours<00:02:19.260> later<00:02:19.709> it<00:02:20.010> was<00:02:20.190> still<00:02:20.430> not

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
like three hours later it was still not

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.850 
like three hours later it was still not
cured<00:02:20.910> so<00:02:21.209> it<00:02:21.660> was<00:02:21.810> just<00:02:21.989> not<00:02:22.170> enough<00:02:22.290> resin

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
cured so it was just not enough resin

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.890 
cured so it was just not enough resin
mixed<00:02:23.760> in<00:02:23.849> with<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.120> food<00:02:24.300> coloring<00:02:24.540> so

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
mixed in with the food coloring so

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.430 
mixed in with the food coloring so
that's<00:02:25.140> just<00:02:25.349> something<00:02:25.739> to<00:02:26.040> think<00:02:26.390> about

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
that's just something to think about

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.710 
that's just something to think about
here<00:02:28.440> I<00:02:28.500> just<00:02:28.800> added<00:02:29.040> some<00:02:29.250> canes<00:02:29.880> to<00:02:30.450> look

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
here I just added some canes to look

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.770 
here I just added some canes to look
like<00:02:30.930> fruit<00:02:31.770> in<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.190> Voss<00:02:32.520> water<00:02:33.180> bottle<00:02:33.599> and

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
like fruit in a Voss water bottle and

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.900 
like fruit in a Voss water bottle and
then<00:02:34.560> this<00:02:34.770> is<00:02:34.950> another<00:02:35.220> one<00:02:35.459> that's<00:02:35.760> just

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
then this is another one that's just

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.059 
then this is another one that's just
like<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.270> square<00:02:36.569> shaped<00:02:36.959> water<00:02:37.349> bottle<00:02:37.739> same

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
like a square shaped water bottle same

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.610 
like a square shaped water bottle same
principle<00:02:38.880> and<00:02:39.150> this<00:02:39.840> one's<00:02:40.110> a<00:02:40.260> little<00:02:40.380> bit

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
principle and this one's a little bit

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.699 
principle and this one's a little bit
round<00:02:40.920> and<00:02:41.480> I'm<00:02:42.480> just<00:02:42.690> popping<00:02:43.170> them<00:02:43.470> out<00:02:43.590> of

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
round and I'm just popping them out of

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.210 
round and I'm just popping them out of
the<00:02:43.770> molds<00:02:44.450> again<00:02:45.450> this<00:02:45.629> one's<00:02:45.870> a<00:02:46.050> like<00:02:46.500> a<00:02:46.530> made

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
the molds again this one's a like a made

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.820 
the molds again this one's a like a made
to<00:02:47.400> look<00:02:47.489> like<00:02:47.550> a<00:02:47.700> boss<00:02:47.940> water<00:02:48.629> bottle<00:02:49.050> it's

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
to look like a boss water bottle it's

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.210 
to look like a boss water bottle it's
just<00:02:50.010> a<00:02:50.129> cylinder<00:02:50.459> really<00:02:50.910> simple<00:02:51.300> and<00:02:52.220> now

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
just a cylinder really simple and now

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.670 
just a cylinder really simple and now
I'm<00:02:53.340> just<00:02:53.489> painting<00:02:53.819> the<00:02:54.060> top<00:02:54.360> so<00:02:55.110> that<00:02:55.140> they

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
I'm just painting the top so that they

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.309 
I'm just painting the top so that they
look<00:02:56.220> like<00:02:56.250> they're<00:02:56.670> plastic<00:02:57.300> tops<00:02:58.050> instead

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
look like they're plastic tops instead

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.430 
look like they're plastic tops instead
of<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.650> clear<00:02:58.920> umm<00:03:00.170> resin

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
of the clear umm resin

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.770 
of the clear umm resin
and<00:03:03.440> now<00:03:04.280> they're<00:03:04.610> starting<00:03:05.150> to<00:03:05.180> come

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
and now they're starting to come

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.260 
and now they're starting to come
together<00:03:05.960> they<00:03:06.410> look<00:03:06.650> a<00:03:06.800> little<00:03:07.070> more<00:03:07.520> like

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
together they look a little more like

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.840 
together they look a little more like
the<00:03:08.420> actual<00:03:08.600> bottles<00:03:09.470> I<00:03:09.770> was<00:03:10.370> starting<00:03:10.730> it

the actual bottles I was starting it
nervous<00:03:11.240> I<00:03:11.420> thought<00:03:11.600> they<00:03:11.750> were<00:03:11.840> really<00:03:12.530> ugly

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740
