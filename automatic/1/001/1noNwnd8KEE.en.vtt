00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:18.050
 one day we started the development of 214 a 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:19.849
 mid-2000 after macbook as 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.220
 you know I worked in the game during 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:24.890
 a long time since 2005 and good nantha 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.390
 you know we never stop when we finish 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.110
 with a game we started preproduction 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.700
 next's 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.800
 and therefore I could tell you that we have 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:38.110
 worked on this title for a long time 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.110
 time since october 2012 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:46.129
 so we have a lot of shooting as soon as 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:48.530
 to the title regarding how we have improved 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.829
 it's something that we always do at a 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.829
 global 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:58.280
 with animations movements gameplay 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.230
 in everything we try to improve ourselves by this 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.850
 year specifically we have focused on 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.679
 improve basic navigation and 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.610
 clear animations in vital for what 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:07.220
 we make 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.820
 to unfold on stage is to paint 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.820
 in a game 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.490
 have these types in a square environment 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.170
 you must offer the feeling that the 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.750
 player controls the people they 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.390
 copies we also have some emotions 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.760
 that seem more realistic more alive have 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.310
 note that many people follow the 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.410
 show because they see every week like this 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.630
 that it is very complicated to compare that 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.220
 you've seen the rock very often because 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.140
 you face what comes out in the game 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.210
 There is a lot of work to do to avoid 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:42.950
 that everything you have assimilated throughout 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:45.050
 of time in general every year we 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.000
 We strive to improve and bring each 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.190
 again and the reality 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.050
 it's not a total evolution but it's a 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.759
 improvement for example in the 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.570
 moves around the stage and the 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.570
 animation system 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.340
 everything is more experience the 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.350
 gameplay in general we work it 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.239
 every year the rating rotates in 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.520
 The movement is not a pure idea 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.100
 Each fighter is different and when 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.240
 releases unleashes his emotions to be able 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.550
 change 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.250
 you can stop two men or three 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.350
 according to the situation they face in 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.430
 this succession of combats in which they advance 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.630
 and they recede 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.340
 we wanted to aggravate whatever it is 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.470
 a good job for now we have only 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.570
 showed a little appetizer but 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.980
 there are much more of his class 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.200
 as the launch approaches 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.120
 You will know more formal but I trust that 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.340
 we have started in the best way with 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.860
 the game one we have worked on 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.320
 for a long time and I think that one 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.850
 really special after things 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.420
 that have happened now we have a great 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.370
 support for 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.650
 the whole team is really delivered 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.970
 you know the license the commitment of the 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.700
 ww 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.230
 and what they offer to the fans is the best 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.730
 representation that has been made in a 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.820
 video game and that's what you have 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.820
 found at www 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:45.200
 because we think it is very important 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:45.200
 but at the same time when 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:07.919
 the game will have its special place be it 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.970
 I can tell in detail how it 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:12.150
 will involve 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:15.290
 that is not the time yet but if this 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.290
 year they will have their vacancy 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:24.380
 perhaps more than in other occasions inside 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.380
 of the ww matches 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.450
 we've seen a few attacks that 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.220
 you can do outside the rival but this 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.230
 it's just a small drop in everything 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.060
 we have prepared we have great things in 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.770
 the chamber and we'll show them according 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.840
 the fans approach 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.760
 They will be very happy with the surprises 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.680
 that we have prepared and the activity was 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.930
 the environment to literally exploit 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.930
 an optimal 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:02.040
 this is so because whenever the 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.860
 Most of the action takes place in the 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:12.560
 train but also as a character more 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:12.560
 It has a lot of value and much more
