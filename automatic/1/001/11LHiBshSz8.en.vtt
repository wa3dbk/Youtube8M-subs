when it comes out so we're just getting

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.290 
when it comes out so we're just getting
a<00:00:22.779> look<00:00:22.900> early<00:00:23.560> so<00:00:24.070> one<00:00:24.220> of<00:00:24.250> the<00:00:24.400> first<00:00:24.430> changes

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
a look early so one of the first changes

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.750 
a look early so one of the first changes
that<00:00:25.480> I<00:00:25.510> noticed<00:00:25.930> in<00:00:26.170> Iowa<00:00:26.949> seven<00:00:27.310> I<00:00:27.430> believe

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.760 
that I noticed in Iowa seven I believe

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.220 
that I noticed in Iowa seven I believe
this<00:00:27.939> wasn't<00:00:28.359> included<00:00:28.600> in<00:00:28.840> all<00:00:29.020> the<00:00:29.199> other

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
this wasn't included in all the other

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.189 
this wasn't included in all the other
betas<00:00:29.710> is<00:00:29.890> the<00:00:30.880> option<00:00:31.240> to<00:00:31.269> create<00:00:31.539> a<00:00:31.660> passcode

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:32.199 
betas is the option to create a passcode

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:34.710 
betas is the option to create a passcode
while<00:00:32.890> you're<00:00:33.430> starting<00:00:33.910> your<00:00:34.059> device<00:00:34.420> so<00:00:34.630> if

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:34.720 
while you're starting your device so if

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.210 
while you're starting your device so if
you<00:00:34.780> set<00:00:34.989> up<00:00:35.050> your<00:00:35.079> device<00:00:35.290> as<00:00:35.590> a<00:00:35.649> new<00:00:35.950> device

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.220 
you set up your device as a new device

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.520 
you set up your device as a new device
along<00:00:36.760> with<00:00:37.030> connecting<00:00:37.690> to<00:00:37.809> Wi-Fi<00:00:37.960> network

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
along with connecting to Wi-Fi network

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.400 
along with connecting to Wi-Fi network
and<00:00:39.399> all<00:00:39.790> those<00:00:39.910> other<00:00:40.210> steps<00:00:40.510> it<00:00:40.809> prompts<00:00:41.350> you

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
and all those other steps it prompts you

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.830 
and all those other steps it prompts you
to<00:00:41.500> create<00:00:42.399> a<00:00:42.520> passcode<00:00:42.940> now<00:00:43.149> you<00:00:43.210> can<00:00:43.480> skip

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
to create a passcode now you can skip

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.479 
to create a passcode now you can skip
this<00:00:44.050> but<00:00:44.559> you<00:00:44.649> can<00:00:44.680> just<00:00:44.800> see<00:00:45.100> that<00:00:45.309> they're

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
this but you can just see that they're

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.270 
this but you can just see that they're
putting<00:00:46.300> more<00:00:46.450> emphasis<00:00:47.050> on<00:00:47.320> having<00:00:48.070> a

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
putting more emphasis on having a

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.389 
putting more emphasis on having a
passcode<00:00:49.059> for<00:00:49.090> your<00:00:49.540> device<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:51.070> the<00:00:51.100> first

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 
passcode for your device so the first

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:54.209 
passcode for your device so the first
thing<00:00:51.489> you'll<00:00:51.700> probably<00:00:51.969> notice<00:00:52.480> when<00:00:53.219> using

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:54.219 
thing you'll probably notice when using

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:56.639 
thing you'll probably notice when using
this<00:00:54.520> fifth<00:00:54.940> beta<00:00:55.239> is<00:00:55.510> that<00:00:56.200> in<00:00:56.350> the<00:00:56.469> settings

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
this fifth beta is that in the settings

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:58.830 
this fifth beta is that in the settings
application<00:00:57.340> the<00:00:57.520> icons<00:00:58.000> on<00:00:58.270> the<00:00:58.300> left<00:00:58.420> are

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
application the icons on the left are

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.389 
application the icons on the left are
now<00:00:58.989> colored<00:00:59.320> and<00:00:59.710> they're<00:01:00.219> a<00:01:00.250> little

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
now colored and they're a little

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:02.160 
now colored and they're a little
different<00:01:00.520> than<00:01:01.090> they<00:01:01.210> were<00:01:01.239> previously<00:01:01.809> as

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
different than they were previously as

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.990 
different than they were previously as
like<00:01:02.469> blue<00:01:02.739> outlines<00:01:03.160> so<00:01:03.610> that's<00:01:03.789> a<00:01:03.879> pretty

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
like blue outlines so that's a pretty

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.749 
like blue outlines so that's a pretty
big<00:01:04.180> change<00:01:05.039> another<00:01:06.039> change<00:01:06.279> that<00:01:06.429> caught<00:01:06.579> my

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 
big change another change that caught my

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:09.179 
big change another change that caught my
eye<00:01:06.789> is<00:01:07.209> when<00:01:07.600> you<00:01:07.810> turn<00:01:08.109> your<00:01:08.499> device<00:01:08.649> off

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:09.189 
eye is when you turn your device off

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:11.399 
eye is when you turn your device off
there's<00:01:09.939> a<00:01:10.090> slightly<00:01:10.420> different<00:01:10.749> power<00:01:11.170> down

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
there's a slightly different power down

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:14.219 
there's a slightly different power down
where<00:01:12.219> when<00:01:12.549> you<00:01:12.579> slide<00:01:13.119> to<00:01:13.539> the<00:01:13.569> right<00:01:13.779> sort

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
where when you slide to the right sort

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.260 
where when you slide to the right sort
of<00:01:14.319> fades<00:01:14.529> out<00:01:14.679> the<00:01:14.859> whole<00:01:15.039> screen<00:01:15.279> and<00:01:15.670> it's

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
of fades out the whole screen and it's

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.029 
of fades out the whole screen and it's
completely<00:01:17.049> different<00:01:17.200> than<00:01:17.469> it<00:01:17.709> used<00:01:17.740> to<00:01:17.979> be

00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:18.039 
completely different than it used to be

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:21.809 
completely different than it used to be
so<00:01:18.340> that's<00:01:18.520> definitely<00:01:19.270> cool<00:01:19.659> a<00:01:20.549> new<00:01:21.549> option

00:01:21.809 --> 00:01:21.819 
so that's definitely cool a new option

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:24.330 
so that's definitely cool a new option
that<00:01:22.359> was<00:01:22.479> added<00:01:22.869> is<00:01:23.049> on/off<00:01:23.649> labels<00:01:24.130> so<00:01:24.249> you

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
that was added is on/off labels so you

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.940 
that was added is on/off labels so you
can<00:01:24.490> see<00:01:24.639> the<00:01:25.359> demo1<00:01:25.689> right<00:01:26.020> here<00:01:26.259> already<00:01:26.529> has

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
can see the demo1 right here already has

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.010 
can see the demo1 right here already has
it<00:01:27.189> where<00:01:27.459> it<00:01:27.670> says<00:01:27.999> off<00:01:28.270> right<00:01:28.659> there<00:01:28.869> was<00:01:28.990> a

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
it where it says off right there was a

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.099 
it where it says off right there was a
little<00:01:29.289> oh<00:01:29.469> and<00:01:29.770> then<00:01:30.249> there's<00:01:30.459> an<00:01:30.609> eye<00:01:31.049> or<00:01:32.049> a

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:32.109 
little oh and then there's an eye or a

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:35.309 
little oh and then there's an eye or a
line<00:01:32.590> when<00:01:33.009> it's<00:01:33.159> on<00:01:33.399> so<00:01:33.849> once<00:01:34.719> you<00:01:34.929> apply<00:01:35.229> the

setting it applies to all the other tabs
around<00:01:37.479> the<00:01:37.840> operating<00:01:38.200> system<00:01:38.560> so<00:01:38.859> they<00:01:39.759> act

00:01:40.019 --> 00:01:40.029 
around the operating system so they act

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:43.019 
around the operating system so they act
accordingly<00:01:40.889> now<00:01:41.889> on<00:01:42.099> the<00:01:42.219> fifth<00:01:42.429> beta<00:01:42.639> pretty
