00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
a new victim we may desperately try to

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
because we feel the energetic shifts the

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.580 
because we feel the energetic shifts the
moment<00:04:39.400> you<00:04:39.580> have<00:04:39.729> called<00:04:40.000> us<00:04:40.240> out<00:04:40.449> it's<00:04:41.199> a<00:04:41.410> bit
