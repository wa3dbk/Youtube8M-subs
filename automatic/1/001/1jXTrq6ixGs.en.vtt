00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
comes to carbon fiber it's kind of a

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.500 
comes to carbon fiber it's kind of a
love-hate<00:02:15.530> relationship<00:02:16.069> you<00:02:17.030> either<00:02:17.180> you

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
love-hate relationship you either you

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.780 
love-hate relationship you either you
know<00:02:17.630> you<00:02:17.930> love<00:02:18.170> it<00:02:18.200> or<00:02:18.349> you<00:02:18.410> hate<00:02:18.530> it<00:02:18.680> and<00:02:19.040> you

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
know you love it or you hate it and you

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.280 
know you love it or you hate it and you
know<00:02:19.910> I'm<00:02:20.030> a<00:02:20.090> big<00:02:20.209> fan<00:02:20.510> of<00:02:20.540> carbon<00:02:20.930> fiber<00:02:21.140> I

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
know I'm a big fan of carbon fiber I

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.020 
know I'm a big fan of carbon fiber I
really<00:02:21.530> like<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.829> nike<00:02:22.190> elite<00:02:22.370> series<00:02:22.640> and

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
really like the nike elite series and

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.780 
really like the nike elite series and
the<00:02:23.510> carbon<00:02:23.750> fiber<00:02:24.110> was<00:02:24.410> no<00:02:25.069> good<00:02:25.280> for<00:02:25.489> me<00:02:25.519> I

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
the carbon fiber was no good for me I

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.180 
the carbon fiber was no good for me I
like<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.299> stability<00:02:26.840> that<00:02:26.870> it<00:02:27.110> gave<00:02:27.260> it<00:02:27.950> was<00:02:28.160> a

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
like the stability that it gave it was a

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.199 
like the stability that it gave it was a
little<00:02:28.400> bit<00:02:28.549> uncomfortable<00:02:28.700> at<00:02:29.180> times

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
little bit uncomfortable at times

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.080 
little bit uncomfortable at times
because<00:02:29.870> you<00:02:30.019> know<00:02:30.140> it<00:02:30.260> is<00:02:30.379> a<00:02:30.410> stiff<00:02:30.769> material

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
because you know it is a stiff material

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.400 
because you know it is a stiff material
but<00:02:32.090> once<00:02:32.239> you<00:02:32.390> break<00:02:32.569> in<00:02:32.750> the<00:02:32.840> boots<00:02:33.049> it<00:02:33.260> can

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
but once you break in the boots it can

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:34.839 
but once you break in the boots it can
flex<00:02:33.709> and<00:02:33.890> it<00:02:34.010> can<00:02:34.129> really<00:02:34.280> help<00:02:34.459> out<00:02:34.700> your

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
flex and it can really help out your

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.039 
flex and it can really help out your
performance<00:02:35.680> so<00:02:36.680> as<00:02:36.799> you<00:02:36.950> see<00:02:37.129> on<00:02:37.519> the<00:02:37.549> boots

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
performance so as you see on the boots

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.949 
performance so as you see on the boots
it<00:02:39.049> is<00:02:39.290> mainly<00:02:39.890> a<00:02:40.069> one<00:02:40.370> layered<00:02:40.730> a<00:02:41.090> one<00:02:41.720> layer

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
it is mainly a one layered a one layer

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.039 
it is mainly a one layered a one layer
on<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.349> top<00:02:42.639> so<00:02:43.639> it's<00:02:43.790> super<00:02:44.269> thin<00:02:44.600> I'm<00:02:44.810> not

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
on the top so it's super thin I'm not

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:45.910 
on the top so it's super thin I'm not
really<00:02:45.170> sure<00:02:45.260> how<00:02:45.470> that's<00:02:45.650> going<00:02:45.799> to<00:02:45.859> affect

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
really sure how that's going to affect

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.420 
really sure how that's going to affect
the<00:02:46.250> durability<00:02:46.700> of<00:02:46.730> it<00:02:48.100> but<00:02:49.100> that<00:02:49.250> is<00:02:49.400> a

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
the durability of it but that is a

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.539 
the durability of it but that is a
microfiber<00:02:50.299> upper<00:02:50.780> so<00:02:51.769> it<00:02:51.950> feels<00:02:52.160> it<00:02:52.519> feels

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
microfiber upper so it feels it feels

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.430 
microfiber upper so it feels it feels
slightly<00:02:53.269> like<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.630> audio<00:02:53.840> zero<00:02:54.079> a<00:02:54.139> little

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
slightly like the audio zero a little

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.309 
slightly like the audio zero a little
bit<00:02:54.560> softer<00:02:54.849> not<00:02:55.849> nothing<00:02:56.420> like<00:02:56.630> the<00:02:56.840> vapor<00:02:57.049> 8

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
bit softer not nothing like the vapor 8

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.890 
bit softer not nothing like the vapor 8
softness<00:02:57.829> but<00:02:58.099> it<00:02:58.639> is<00:02:58.790> softer<00:02:59.180> than<00:02:59.209> the<00:02:59.389> i-20

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
softness but it is softer than the i-20

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.089 
softness but it is softer than the i-20
um<00:03:01.239> see<00:03:02.239> you<00:03:02.510> also<00:03:02.959> have<00:03:03.139> this<00:03:03.290> unique<00:03:03.470> lacing

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
um see you also have this unique lacing

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.789 
um see you also have this unique lacing
system<00:03:04.690> haven't<00:03:05.690> really<00:03:05.750> seen<00:03:06.049> anything<00:03:06.500> like

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
system haven't really seen anything like

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.259 
system haven't really seen anything like
that<00:03:06.859> go<00:03:07.220> on<00:03:07.310> the<00:03:07.430> outside<00:03:07.880> of<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:08.120> boot

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
that go on the outside of the boot

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.300 
that go on the outside of the boot
usually<00:03:08.660> it<00:03:09.200> comes<00:03:09.380> straight<00:03:09.709> down<00:03:09.769> the<00:03:10.130> boot

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
usually it comes straight down the boot

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.699 
usually it comes straight down the boot
but<00:03:10.519> this<00:03:11.030> one<00:03:11.269> kind<00:03:11.569> of<00:03:11.720> goes<00:03:12.139> a<00:03:12.169> little<00:03:12.470> bit

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
but this one kind of goes a little bit

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.539 
but this one kind of goes a little bit
up<00:03:12.919> to<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.519> to<00:03:14.180> the<00:03:14.209> outside<00:03:14.750> of<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:15.139> shoe<00:03:15.549> now

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
up to the to the outside of the shoe now

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.069 
up to the to the outside of the shoe now
which<00:03:16.730> is<00:03:16.760> pretty<00:03:17.060> unique<00:03:17.269> when<00:03:17.569> it<00:03:17.660> comes<00:03:17.840> to

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
which is pretty unique when it comes to

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.039 
which is pretty unique when it comes to
lacing<00:03:18.980> systems<00:03:19.370> as<00:03:19.609> you<00:03:19.760> can<00:03:19.880> see<00:03:20.030> here<00:03:20.419> the

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
lacing systems as you can see here the

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.080 
lacing systems as you can see here the
heel<00:03:21.290> counters<00:03:21.709> are<00:03:21.859> more<00:03:21.980> of<00:03:22.069> a<00:03:22.160> V<00:03:22.489> not<00:03:22.819> really

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
heel counters are more of a V not really

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.360 
heel counters are more of a V not really
rounded<00:03:23.540> like<00:03:23.690> most<00:03:24.049> hear<00:03:24.799> them<00:03:24.919> going<00:03:25.010> on<00:03:25.250> it

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
rounded like most hear them going on it

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.909 
rounded like most hear them going on it
shoot<00:03:25.790> you<00:03:26.650> here's<00:03:27.650> a<00:03:27.709> laser<00:03:29.230> very<00:03:30.230> rounded<00:03:30.769> on

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:30.919 
shoot you here's a laser very rounded on

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.819 
shoot you here's a laser very rounded on
the<00:03:30.950> heel<00:03:31.280> and<00:03:31.430> then<00:03:31.669> with<00:03:32.630> these<00:03:32.840> it's<00:03:33.260> a<00:03:33.470> you

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
the heel and then with these it's a you

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:36.729 
the heel and then with these it's a you
know<00:03:33.950> cut<00:03:34.220> off<00:03:34.340> kind<00:03:34.700> of<00:03:34.730> like<00:03:34.880> in<00:03:35.030> a<00:03:35.120> V<00:03:35.739> this

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
know cut off kind of like in a V this

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.559 
know cut off kind of like in a V this
heel<00:03:37.099> counter<00:03:37.340> is<00:03:37.609> pretty<00:03:37.849> sturdy<00:03:38.209> so<00:03:38.450> I<00:03:38.480> think

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
heel counter is pretty sturdy so I think

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.349 
heel counter is pretty sturdy so I think
that<00:03:38.810> will<00:03:38.870> provide<00:03:39.200> good<00:03:39.500> protection<00:03:40.359> it

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359 
that will provide good protection it

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:43.150 
that will provide good protection it
does<00:03:41.599> look<00:03:41.630> like<00:03:41.870> a<00:03:41.930> wide<00:03:42.230> fit<00:03:42.590> nothing<00:03:42.980> like<00:03:43.130> a

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
does look like a wide fit nothing like a

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.640 
does look like a wide fit nothing like a
like<00:03:43.669> a<00:03:43.700> thumb<00:03:44.060> thumb<00:03:44.930> like<00:03:45.109> fit<00:03:45.380> like<00:03:45.530> you

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
like a thumb thumb like fit like you

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.179 
like a thumb thumb like fit like you
find<00:03:45.859> that<00:03:45.950> the<00:03:46.010> i-20<00:03:47.890> definitely<00:03:48.890> a<00:03:48.950> wider

00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:49.189 
find that the i-20 definitely a wider

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:51.280 
find that the i-20 definitely a wider
fit<00:03:49.430> it<00:03:49.610> actually<00:03:49.909> looks<00:03:50.090> a<00:03:50.299> lot<00:03:50.900> wider<00:03:51.200> than

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
fit it actually looks a lot wider than

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.000 
fit it actually looks a lot wider than
most

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
most

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.410 
most
with<00:03:52.370> most<00:03:52.580> shoes<00:03:52.819> so<00:03:53.000> I'm<00:03:53.090> not<00:03:53.239> really<00:03:53.330> sure

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
with most shoes so I'm not really sure

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.789 
with most shoes so I'm not really sure
how<00:03:53.569> that's<00:03:53.720> going<00:03:53.870> to<00:03:53.930> affect<00:03:53.989> narrow<00:03:54.470> footed

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
how that's going to affect narrow footed

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.949 
how that's going to affect narrow footed
players<00:03:55.040> but<00:03:55.340> I'm<00:03:55.909> sure<00:03:56.180> they'll<00:03:56.420> find<00:03:56.629> a<00:03:56.930> way

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
players but I'm sure they'll find a way
