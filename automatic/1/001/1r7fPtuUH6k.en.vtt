00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
I'm not really sure why I didn't do the

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.630 
I'm not really sure why I didn't do the
whole<00:00:13.259> song<00:00:15.289> but<00:00:16.289> I'll<00:00:16.859> go<00:00:17.070> through<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.340> intro

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.980 
again pretty simple a lot of tabs out
they<00:00:23.400> are<00:00:23.460> wrong<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:24.029> they<00:00:24.300> just<00:00:24.570> sound

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
they are wrong and they just sound

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.130 
they are wrong and they just sound
really<00:00:25.619> terrible<00:00:26.010> but<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:26.939> play<00:00:27.390> like<00:00:27.630> this<00:00:27.810> I'm

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
really terrible but I play like this I'm

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.710 
really terrible but I play like this I'm
dead<00:00:29.010> positive<00:00:29.640> that<00:00:29.760> this<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.570> way

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
dead positive that this is the the way

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.799 
dead positive that this is the the way
it<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.019> in<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.940> in<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.059> actual<00:00:33.390> album<00:00:33.570> that

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
it is in the in the actual album that

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:50.260 
it is in the in the actual album that
goes<00:00:33.930> like<00:00:34.020> this

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.470 

that's<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.450> intro<00:00:51.780> it's<00:00:52.440> not<00:00:52.590> too<00:00:52.800> difficult

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
that's the intro it's not too difficult

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.980 
that's the intro it's not too difficult
the<00:00:54.480> main<00:00:54.690> part<00:00:54.990> is<00:00:55.140> this<00:00:56.210> that<00:00:57.210> everybody

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:57.990 
the main part is this that everybody

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.479 
the main part is this that everybody
just<00:00:58.050> seems<00:00:58.740> to<00:00:58.860> get<00:00:59.010> wrong<00:00:59.160> like<00:00:59.370> they'll

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
just seems to get wrong like they'll

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.150 
just seems to get wrong like they'll
play<00:00:59.640> like<00:00:59.820> this<00:00:59.930> and<00:01:00.930> that's<00:01:01.530> not<00:01:01.770> right<00:01:04.160> the

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
play like this and that's not right the

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.600 
play like this and that's not right the
verse<00:01:05.870> is<00:01:06.870> pretty<00:01:07.260> easy<00:01:07.440> I<00:01:07.800> just<00:01:08.100> goes<00:01:08.430> like

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
verse is pretty easy I just goes like

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:20.960 
verse is pretty easy I just goes like
this

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.590 

one<00:01:21.970> thing<00:01:22.119> I'll<00:01:22.240> show<00:01:22.479> is<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:24.640> way<00:01:24.759> Tom<00:01:25.030> plays

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
one thing I'll show is the way Tom plays

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.130 
one thing I'll show is the way Tom plays
like<00:01:25.869> the<00:01:26.020> second<00:01:27.090> like<00:01:28.090> the<00:01:28.210> second<00:01:28.630> version

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
like the second like the second version

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.969 
like the second like the second version
of<00:01:29.439> the<00:01:29.920> chorus<00:01:30.340> which<00:01:31.210> I<00:01:31.720> always<00:01:32.470> play<00:01:32.740> when<00:01:32.950> I

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
of the chorus which I always play when I

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:34.620 
of the chorus which I always play when I
play<00:01:33.220> it<00:01:33.280> just<00:01:33.399> it's<00:01:33.790> just<00:01:33.850> pretty<00:01:34.240> fun<00:01:34.420> it

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
play it just it's just pretty fun it

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:47.399 
play it just it's just pretty fun it
goes<00:01:34.750> like<00:01:34.930> this

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.920 

it's<00:01:48.009> not<00:01:48.159> too<00:01:48.310> difficult<00:01:48.850> you're<00:01:49.420> really

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
it's not too difficult you're really

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.149 
it's not too difficult you're really
wearing<00:01:50.080> a<00:01:50.259> bow<00:01:50.409> or<00:01:50.439> just<00:01:50.770> two<00:01:51.009> different

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
wearing a bow or just two different

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:57.419 
wearing a bow or just two different
chords<00:01:51.909> and<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:54.640> first<00:01:54.909> one<00:01:56.310> you're<00:01:57.310> not

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429 
chords and the first one you're not

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:59.669 
chords and the first one you're not
really<00:01:57.670> like<00:01:57.850> hidden<00:01:58.090> chords<00:01:58.530> except<00:01:59.530> for

00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679 
really like hidden chords except for

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:15.390 
really like hidden chords except for
like<00:01:59.770> the<00:01:59.950> first<00:02:00.220> first<00:02:00.940> it

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.199 

in<00:02:16.400> all<00:02:16.520> you're<00:02:16.670> really<00:02:16.730> doing<00:02:16.880> is<00:02:17.150> just

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
in all you're really doing is just

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.570 
in all you're really doing is just
hammering<00:02:17.599> on<00:02:17.900> from<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:18.319> 2<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:18.980> 4<00:02:19.280> on<00:02:19.489> the

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
hammering on from the 2 to the 4 on the

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.380 
hammering on from the 2 to the 4 on the
D<00:02:19.730> string<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:20.270> then<00:02:20.930> sliding<00:02:21.440> up<00:02:21.650> to<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:22.390> D

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
D string and then sliding up to the D

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.110 
D string and then sliding up to the D
chord<00:02:24.040> and<00:02:25.040> then<00:02:25.280> just<00:02:25.520> going<00:02:25.760> right<00:02:25.910> back

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
chord and then just going right back

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.250 
chord and then just going right back
down<00:02:26.330> I<00:02:26.360> mean<00:02:26.660> it's<00:02:26.780> really<00:02:26.900> not<00:02:27.080> too

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
down I mean it's really not too

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.660 
down I mean it's really not too
difficult

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
difficult

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.710 
difficult
maybe<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:30.230> chorus<00:02:30.620> is<00:02:30.769> pretty<00:02:31.010> simple<00:02:31.190> too

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
maybe the chorus is pretty simple too

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.680 
maybe the chorus is pretty simple too
there's<00:02:32.720> two<00:02:32.959> main<00:02:33.140> parts<00:02:33.470> to<00:02:33.650> it<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:35.450> first

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
there's two main parts to it the first

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:44.600 
there's two main parts to it the first
part<00:02:35.810> goes<00:02:36.200> like<00:02:36.380> this

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:57.140 

the<00:02:45.510> second<00:02:45.840> part<00:02:46.050> goes<00:02:46.200> like<00:02:46.230> this<00:02:56.060> you<00:02:57.060> don't

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
the second part goes like this you don't

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.610 
the second part goes like this you don't
really<00:02:57.240> have<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:57.600> put<00:02:57.720> those<00:02:57.900> triplets<00:02:58.200> in<00:02:58.470> if

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
really have to put those triplets in if

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.620 
really have to put those triplets in if
you<00:02:58.710> don't<00:02:58.890> want<00:03:01.280> it<00:03:02.280> I'm<00:03:02.700> pretty<00:03:03.450> sure

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
you don't want it I'm pretty sure

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.270 
you don't want it I'm pretty sure
they're<00:03:03.780> in<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:03.990> studio<00:03:04.740> burger<00:03:05.070> and<00:03:05.190> I've

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
they're in the studio burger and I've

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.520 
they're in the studio burger and I've
always<00:03:05.460> heard<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:06.390> triplets<00:03:06.780> in<00:03:06.930> there<00:03:07.110> but<00:03:07.290> I

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
always heard the triplets in there but I

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.870 
always heard the triplets in there but I
don't<00:03:07.560> think<00:03:07.890> I've<00:03:08.040> ever<00:03:08.070> seen<00:03:08.460> Tom's<00:03:08.670> lamb

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
don't think I've ever seen Tom's lamb

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.760 
don't think I've ever seen Tom's lamb
light<00:03:09.120> so<00:03:09.870> I<00:03:09.900> mean<00:03:10.200> it's<00:03:10.320> really<00:03:10.380> up<00:03:10.590> to<00:03:10.830> you

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
light so I mean it's really up to you

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.270 
light so I mean it's really up to you
the<00:03:13.770> only<00:03:13.890> other<00:03:13.980> thing<00:03:14.400> is<00:03:14.820> the<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.210> bridge

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
the only other thing is the the bridge

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.010 
the only other thing is the the bridge
which<00:03:17.280> also<00:03:17.550> has<00:03:17.790> two<00:03:18.030> parts<00:03:18.390> there's<00:03:18.990> a

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
which also has two parts there's a

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.270 
which also has two parts there's a
little<00:03:19.200> picking<00:03:19.560> part<00:03:19.800> and<00:03:19.980> then<00:03:20.100> there's

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
little picking part and then there's

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.470 
little picking part and then there's
just<00:03:21.320> a<00:03:22.320> few<00:03:22.980> chords<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:23.640> the<00:03:24.000> pagan<00:03:24.180> part

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
just a few chords and the pagan part

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:35.260 
just a few chords and the pagan part
goes<00:03:24.600> like<00:03:24.690> this

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.600 

I'm<00:03:36.110> not<00:03:36.650> entirely<00:03:36.860> sure<00:03:36.980> if<00:03:37.220> that's<00:03:37.370> how<00:03:37.520> it

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
I'm not entirely sure if that's how it

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:38.950 
I'm not entirely sure if that's how it
goes<00:03:37.730> I<00:03:37.850> think<00:03:38.060> that<00:03:38.150> sounds<00:03:38.450> pretty<00:03:38.600> good<00:03:38.810> in

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960 
goes I think that sounds pretty good in

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.990 
goes I think that sounds pretty good in
there<00:03:39.080> though<00:03:39.340> Tom<00:03:40.340> whenever<00:03:40.850> they're

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
there though Tom whenever they're

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.610 
there though Tom whenever they're
playing<00:03:41.240> that<00:03:41.330> there<00:03:42.020> he's<00:03:42.260> always<00:03:42.500> uh

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
playing that there he's always uh

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.040 
playing that there he's always uh
random-ass<00:03:45.620> notes<00:03:45.920> I<00:03:46.220> mean<00:03:46.400> that's<00:03:46.580> just<00:03:46.640> Tom

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
random-ass notes I mean that's just Tom

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.720 
random-ass notes I mean that's just Tom
you<00:03:48.050> could<00:03:48.170> do<00:03:48.290> the<00:03:48.380> same<00:03:48.620> if<00:03:48.950> you<00:03:49.160> felt<00:03:49.640> like

you could do the same if you felt like

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.440 
you could do the same if you felt like
it's<00:03:50.420> really<00:03:50.630> no<00:03:50.750> no<00:03:51.680> big<00:03:51.890> deal<00:03:52.100> the<00:03:53.090> second

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
it's really no no big deal the second

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.910 
it's really no no big deal the second

part of the bridge there's just a few

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:01.230 
part of the bridge there's just a few
chords<00:03:55.220> and<00:03:55.490> starts<00:03:56.240> up<00:03:56.360> with<00:03:56.390> an<00:03:56.630> f-sharp<00:03:57.190> 5

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.240 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.960 

that<00:04:02.240> goes<00:04:02.450> to<00:04:02.630> it<00:04:02.810> addi<00:04:03.490> you<00:04:04.490> can<00:04:04.580> either<00:04:04.730> play

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
that goes to it addi you can either play

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
that goes to it addi you can either play
MIDI<00:04:05.540> down

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.590 

just<00:04:27.990> go<00:04:28.110> back<00:04:28.320> to<00:04:28.470> the<00:04:28.560> chorus<00:04:28.830> and<00:04:29.460> then<00:04:30.450> it's

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
just go back to the chorus and then it's

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.420 
just go back to the chorus and then it's
just<00:04:30.720> the<00:04:30.870> outro<00:04:31.290> which<00:04:31.500> is<00:04:31.650> the<00:04:32.010> same<00:04:32.190> as<00:04:32.340> the

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
just the outro which is the same as the

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.840 
just the outro which is the same as the
intro<00:04:32.730> so<00:04:34.100> hopefully<00:04:35.100> this<00:04:35.250> helps<00:04:35.520> for<00:04:35.790> the

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
intro so hopefully this helps for the

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.360 
intro so hopefully this helps for the
song<00:04:36.060> on<00:04:36.480> it's<00:04:37.350> pretty<00:04:37.650> fun<00:04:37.830> song<00:04:38.070> plays

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
song on it's pretty fun song plays

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.250 
song on it's pretty fun song plays
probably<00:04:38.910> my<00:04:39.270> favourite<00:04:39.660> bling<00:04:39.810> song<00:04:40.050> to<00:04:40.170> play

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
probably my favourite bling song to play

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:46.160 
probably my favourite bling song to play
actually<00:04:42.290> that's<00:04:43.290> that's<00:04:43.680> pretty<00:04:43.800> much<00:04:43.920> it
