and<00:04:15.590> that<00:04:15.650> creates<00:04:16.340> a<00:04:16.489> whole<00:04:16.730> new<00:04:16.760> set<00:04:17.000> of

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
and that creates a whole new set of

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.330 
and that creates a whole new set of
problems<00:04:17.390> for<00:04:17.870> riders<00:04:18.320> and<00:04:18.590> tire<00:04:19.010> selection

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
problems for riders and tire selection

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
here is Jerry Bailey with a look at that

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.640 
here is Jerry Bailey with a look at that
Larry<00:04:23.240> the<00:04:23.420> racetrack<00:04:23.810> here<00:04:24.050> in<00:04:24.140> Miami<00:04:24.440> is

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
Larry the racetrack here in Miami is

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.050 
Larry the racetrack here in Miami is
considerably<00:04:25.220> different<00:04:25.430> than<00:04:25.760> that<00:04:25.850> of<00:04:25.910> the

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
considerably different than that of the

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.580 
considerably different than that of the
first<00:04:26.270> four<00:04:26.480> rounds<00:04:26.690> rather<00:04:27.080> than<00:04:27.290> being<00:04:27.410> the

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
first four rounds rather than being the

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.290 
first four rounds rather than being the
hard-packed<00:04:27.890> in<00:04:28.340> the<00:04:28.430> clay<00:04:28.640> it's<00:04:28.820> much<00:04:29.030> softer

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
hard-packed in the clay it's much softer

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.260 
hard-packed in the clay it's much softer

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
more lomi style not only a riding style

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.700 
more lomi style not only a riding style
is<00:04:32.390> gonna<00:04:32.510> change<00:04:32.780> but<00:04:33.050> the<00:04:33.140> tires<00:04:33.350> are<00:04:33.590> going

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
is gonna change but the tires are going

to have to be changed and the right

to have to be changed and the right
selection<00:04:35.690> of<00:04:35.780> tires<00:04:35.960> could<00:04:36.290> make<00:04:36.440> the

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
selection of tires could make the

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.020 
selection of tires could make the
difference<00:04:36.920> between<00:04:37.010> first<00:04:37.430> and<00:04:37.670> second

different brands of tires but the main

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.120 
different brands of tires but the main
thing<00:04:41.690> the<00:04:41.810> riders<00:04:42.140> look<00:04:42.410> for<00:04:42.620> is<00:04:42.770> the<00:04:42.920> lug

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
thing the riders look for is the lug

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.700 
thing the riders look for is the lug
pattern<00:04:43.160> that<00:04:43.670> is<00:04:43.850> there<00:04:44.260> if<00:04:45.260> it's<00:04:45.470> a<00:04:45.530> very

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
pattern that is there if it's a very

pattern that is there if it's a very
sandy<00:04:46.130> racetrack<00:04:46.580> the<00:04:46.790> riders<00:04:47.120> will<00:04:47.270> use<00:04:47.480> the

little bit further apart if it's a
