00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
lot about OLED TVs a lot of people don't

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.230 
lot about OLED TVs a lot of people don't
really<00:00:19.710> know<00:00:19.949> what<00:00:20.250> they<00:00:20.460> mean<00:00:20.699> can<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.000> kind

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
really know what they mean can you kind

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.179 
really know what they mean can you kind
of<00:00:21.270> explain<00:00:21.390> it<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:21.930> Reader's<00:00:22.410> Digest<00:00:22.439> kind<00:00:23.130> of

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
of explain it a Reader's Digest kind of

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.609 
of explain it a Reader's Digest kind of
a<00:00:23.220> summary<00:00:23.400> sure<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:24.150> mean<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.539> stands<00:00:25.350> for

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
a summary sure I mean it stands for

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.160 
a summary sure I mean it stands for
organic<00:00:26.310> light-emitting<00:00:26.849> diode<00:00:27.539> but<00:00:28.050> the

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
organic light-emitting diode but the

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.560 
organic light-emitting diode but the
basic<00:00:28.650> premise<00:00:28.859> is<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.910> material<00:00:30.539> that

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
basic premise is that the material that

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.930 
basic premise is that the material that
creates<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.260> color<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.830> not<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.309> good<00:00:32.489> organic

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
creates the color is not a good organic

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.080 
creates the color is not a good organic
natural<00:00:33.360> substance<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.440> each<00:00:35.130> pixel<00:00:35.700> has

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
natural substance and each pixel has

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.290 
natural substance and each pixel has
white<00:00:36.750> green<00:00:37.110> blue<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.800> red<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.760> it

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
white green blue and red and it

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.299 
white green blue and red and it
individually<00:00:40.079> can<00:00:40.230> be<00:00:40.350> controlled<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:41.160> if<00:00:41.219> you

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
individually can be controlled so if you

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.369 
individually can be controlled so if you
want<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.640> dark<00:00:42.030> pixel<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.780> just<00:00:42.989> turn<00:00:43.140> off<00:00:43.170> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
want a dark pixel you just turn off the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.470 
want a dark pixel you just turn off the
power<00:00:43.559> right<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.610> best<00:00:44.850> part<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.270> it's<00:00:45.390> a

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
power right the best part of it it's a

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.240 
power right the best part of it it's a
natural<00:00:45.719> substance<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.980> takes<00:00:47.129> a

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
natural substance and it takes a

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.700 
natural substance and it takes a
fraction<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.450> energy<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:49.110> charge<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.590> up

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
fraction of the energy to charge it up

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.459 
fraction of the energy to charge it up
so<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.280> can<00:00:50.520> make<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.940> panel's<00:00:51.449> finger<00:00:52.260> like

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
so you can make the panel's finger like

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.970 
so you can make the panel's finger like
thin<00:00:52.850> so<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:53.910> can<00:00:54.120> get<00:00:54.300> our<00:00:54.980> excellent

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
thin so you can get our excellent

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.979 
thin so you can get our excellent
quality<00:00:56.430> but<00:00:56.579> not<00:00:56.760> use<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.120> much<00:00:57.270> power<00:00:57.480> do<00:00:57.960> I

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
quality but not use that much power do I

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.990 
quality but not use that much power do I
got<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.289> right<00:00:58.440> yeah<00:00:58.859> it's<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.520> energy

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
got it right yeah it's so energy

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.479 
got it right yeah it's so energy
efficient<00:01:00.390> it's<00:01:01.020> compared<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.739> an<00:01:01.859> LCD<00:01:02.219> LED

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
efficient it's compared to an LCD LED

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.119 
efficient it's compared to an LCD LED
plasma<00:01:02.960> there's<00:01:03.960> no<00:01:04.080> comparison<00:01:04.619> happening

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
plasma there's no comparison happening

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.760 
plasma there's no comparison happening
no<00:01:05.220> comparison<00:01:05.670> aw<00:01:05.790> ok<00:01:06.689> I'm<00:01:06.900> looking<00:01:07.530> at<00:01:07.650> this

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
no comparison aw ok I'm looking at this

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.039 
no comparison aw ok I'm looking at this
television<00:01:08.130> over<00:01:08.460> here<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.880> correct<00:01:09.869> me<00:01:09.990> if

also smart a smart LED 3d TV how much

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.499 
also smart a smart LED 3d TV how much
price<00:01:32.280> we're<00:01:32.460> looking<00:01:32.670> at<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:33.180> looking<00:01:33.270> at

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
price we're looking at you looking at

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.660 
price we're looking at you looking at
fifteen<00:01:33.930> thousand<00:01:34.350> dollars<00:01:34.680> but<00:01:35.400> when<00:01:35.549> you're

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
fifteen thousand dollars but when you're

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.569 
fifteen thousand dollars but when you're
looking<00:01:35.820> overall<00:01:36.180> context<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.890> first<00:01:38.189> 42

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
looking overall context of the first 42

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.819 
looking overall context of the first 42
inch<00:01:38.850> plasma<00:01:38.939> was<00:01:39.630> forty<00:01:40.020> thousand<00:01:40.439> dollars

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
inch plasma was forty thousand dollars

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.249 
inch plasma was forty thousand dollars
so<00:01:41.490> obviously<00:01:42.030> price<00:01:42.360> will<00:01:42.570> begin<00:01:42.810> zero<00:01:43.200> to

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
so obviously price will begin zero to

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.980 
so obviously price will begin zero to
come<00:01:43.590> down<00:01:43.890> as<00:01:44.159> time<00:01:44.520> passes<00:01:44.790> but<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.780> know

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
come down as time passes but you know

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.719 
come down as time passes but you know
already<00:01:46.229> there's<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.710> lot<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.130> excitement

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
already there's a lot of excitement

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.160 
already there's a lot of excitement
because<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.299> picture<00:01:48.600> quality<00:01:48.810> and

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
because of the picture quality and

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.899 
because of the picture quality and
that's<00:01:49.290> really<00:01:49.470> where<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.740> tvs<00:01:50.040> drive<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.790> put

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
that's really where the tvs drive to put

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.030 
that's really where the tvs drive to put
you<00:01:51.079> you<00:01:52.079> know<00:01:52.170> i<00:01:52.229> totally<00:01:52.680> agree<00:01:52.740> with<00:01:52.890> that

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
you you know i totally agree with that

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.819 
you you know i totally agree with that
you<00:01:53.520> really<00:01:53.909> can't<00:01:54.270> appreciate<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:55.049> until<00:01:55.560> you

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
you really can't appreciate it until you

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.139 
you really can't appreciate it until you
take<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.040> look<00:01:56.280> for<00:01:56.460> yourself<00:01:56.790> like<00:01:56.939> when<00:01:57.119> I

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
take a look for yourself like when I

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.399 
take a look for yourself like when I
looked<00:01:57.390> at<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.509> looks<00:01:57.750> just<00:01:57.810> beautiful<00:01:58.140> the

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
looked at it looks just beautiful the

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.770 
looked at it looks just beautiful the
colors<00:01:58.770> are<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:58.979> stunning<00:01:59.880> they<00:02:00.329> just<00:02:00.570> kind<00:02:00.719> of

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
colors are so stunning they just kind of

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.990 
colors are so stunning they just kind of
come<00:02:01.140> right<00:02:01.409> out<00:02:01.439> right<00:02:01.920> right<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.460> again<00:02:02.850> is

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
come right out right right and again is

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.819 
come right out right right and again is
that<00:02:03.030> it's<00:02:03.600> because<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.170> has<00:02:04.259> an<00:02:04.380> organic

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
that it's because it has an organic

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.459 
that it's because it has an organic
material<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.820> could<00:02:06.119> replicate<00:02:06.570> almost<00:02:07.320> an

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
material it could replicate almost an

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.540 
material it could replicate almost an
entire<00:02:07.619> all<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.759> colors<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.509> human<00:02:09.840> eye

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
entire all the colors to the human eye

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.490 
entire all the colors to the human eye
so<00:02:10.940> you<00:02:11.000> mentioned<00:02:11.270> plasmas<00:02:11.900> being<00:02:12.140> expensive

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
so you mentioned plasmas being expensive

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.890 
so you mentioned plasmas being expensive
is<00:02:12.770> this<00:02:12.890> a<00:02:12.950> plasma<00:02:13.520> LED<00:02:14.030> what<00:02:14.690> kind<00:02:14.840> of

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
is this a plasma LED what kind of

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.720 
is this a plasma LED what kind of
television<00:02:15.350> we<00:02:15.500> talk<00:02:15.650> entirely<00:02:16.400> new

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
television we talk entirely new

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.940 
television we talk entirely new
technology<00:02:17.420> that's<00:02:17.990> why<00:02:18.170> it's<00:02:18.320> called<00:02:18.380> OLED

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
technology that's why it's called OLED

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.950 
technology that's why it's called OLED
so<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.820> difference<00:02:20.000> is<00:02:20.300> there's<00:02:20.720> no

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
so the difference is there's no

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.800 
so the difference is there's no
backlight<00:02:21.500> like<00:02:22.130> LED<00:02:22.610> or<00:02:22.760> LCD<00:02:22.850> so<00:02:23.540> it's<00:02:23.660> not

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
backlight like LED or LCD so it's not

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.430 
backlight like LED or LCD so it's not
that<00:02:24.040> it<00:02:25.040> doesn't<00:02:25.490> use<00:02:25.730> phosphorus<00:02:26.630> grass<00:02:27.050> so

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
that it doesn't use phosphorus grass so

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.650 
that it doesn't use phosphorus grass so
it's<00:02:27.560> not<00:02:27.650> a<00:02:27.710> plasma<00:02:28.280> it's<00:02:28.700> completely<00:02:29.390> a<00:02:29.420> new

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
it's not a plasma it's completely a new

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.390 
it's not a plasma it's completely a new
technology<00:02:30.290> so<00:02:30.620> it's<00:02:30.770> in<00:02:30.830> its<00:02:30.980> own<00:02:31.160> category

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
technology so it's in its own category

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.240 
technology so it's in its own category
of<00:02:32.180> itself<00:02:32.450> that's<00:02:32.930> correct<00:02:33.230> speaking<00:02:34.160> of

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
of itself that's correct speaking of

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.010 
of itself that's correct speaking of
something<00:02:34.610> in<00:02:34.700> its<00:02:34.820> own<00:02:35.030> category<00:02:35.270> of<00:02:35.720> itself

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
something in its own category of itself

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.710 
something in its own category of itself
what<00:02:36.830> do<00:02:36.920> we<00:02:36.980> have<00:02:37.250> here<00:02:37.310> Frank<00:02:38.000> what<00:02:38.420> what<00:02:38.600> is

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
what do we have here Frank what what is

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.930 
what do we have here Frank what what is
going<00:02:39.050> on<00:02:39.110> god<00:02:39.500> this<00:02:39.710> is<00:02:39.890> blowing<00:02:40.220> my<00:02:40.400> mind<00:02:40.520> up

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
going on god this is blowing my mind up

what you see over here is a curved Oh
LED<00:02:45.170> TV<00:02:45.530> by<00:02:45.860> LG<00:02:46.310> and<00:02:46.580> I<00:02:47.060> understand<00:02:47.630> it<00:02:47.840> is<00:02:47.990> the

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
LED TV by LG and I understand it is the

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.910 
LED TV by LG and I understand it is the
world's<00:02:48.380> first<00:02:48.830> curved<00:02:49.250> 3d<00:02:50.090> OLED<00:02:50.990> TV<00:02:51.470> that's

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
world's first curved 3d OLED TV that's

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.640 
world's first curved 3d OLED TV that's
correct<00:02:52.220> amazing<00:02:53.060> what<00:02:53.240> this<00:02:53.420> does<00:02:53.660> now<00:02:53.960> the

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
correct amazing what this does now the

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.130 
correct amazing what this does now the
curve<00:02:55.040> is<00:02:55.310> done<00:02:55.610> in<00:02:55.760> such<00:02:55.970> an<00:02:56.180> angle<00:02:56.630> so<00:02:57.110> that

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
curve is done in such an angle so that

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.310 
curve is done in such an angle so that
when<00:02:57.410> you're<00:02:57.590> sitting<00:02:57.890> before<00:02:58.190> it<00:02:58.640> the<00:02:59.540> every

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
when you're sitting before it the every

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.740 
when you're sitting before it the every
part<00:03:00.590> of<00:03:00.620> that<00:03:00.770> screen<00:03:01.160> is<00:03:01.430> equidistant<00:03:02.210> from

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
part of that screen is equidistant from

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.680 
part of that screen is equidistant from
your<00:03:03.050> eyes<00:03:03.230> so<00:03:03.860> there's<00:03:04.040> no<00:03:04.250> distortion<00:03:05.060> again

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
your eyes so there's no distortion again

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.930 
your eyes so there's no distortion again
giving<00:03:06.050> you<00:03:06.170> perfect<00:03:06.740> picture<00:03:07.040> quality<00:03:07.460> you

giving you perfect picture quality you

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.460 
giving you perfect picture quality you
know<00:03:08.030> I've<00:03:08.210> heard<00:03:08.540> about<00:03:08.720> this<00:03:08.870> technology

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
know I've heard about this technology

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.710 
know I've heard about this technology
like<00:03:09.740> a<00:03:09.770> commercial<00:03:10.130> applications<00:03:11.000> right<00:03:11.270> but

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
like a commercial applications right but

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.360 
like a commercial applications right but
this<00:03:11.840> is<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:11.990> first<00:03:12.260> time<00:03:12.470> I've<00:03:12.800> seen<00:03:12.860> it<00:03:13.160> in<00:03:13.250> a

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
this is the first time I've seen it in a

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.150 
this is the first time I've seen it in a
consumer<00:03:13.940> product<00:03:14.840> right<00:03:15.260> right<00:03:15.530> I<00:03:15.800> mean<00:03:16.070> you

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
consumer product right right I mean you

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.640 
consumer product right right I mean you
may<00:03:16.310> have<00:03:16.459> seen<00:03:16.640> it<00:03:16.850> where<00:03:17.060> they'll<00:03:17.540> wrap<00:03:18.140> a<00:03:18.170> TV

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
may have seen it where they'll wrap a TV

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.250 
may have seen it where they'll wrap a TV
around<00:03:18.980> a<00:03:19.310> pillar<00:03:19.610> and<00:03:20.000> it's<00:03:20.420> stopping<00:03:20.959> power

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
around a pillar and it's stopping power

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.199 
around a pillar and it's stopping power
but<00:03:21.890> we<00:03:22.010> figure<00:03:22.280> how<00:03:22.489> can<00:03:22.700> we<00:03:22.820> take<00:03:23.030> that

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
but we figure how can we take that

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.570 
but we figure how can we take that
technology<00:03:23.420> we<00:03:24.080> have<00:03:24.260> and<00:03:24.680> bring<00:03:25.130> it<00:03:25.220> into<00:03:25.370> the

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
technology we have and bring it into the

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.550 
technology we have and bring it into the
home<00:03:25.760> in<00:03:25.910> a<00:03:26.000> meaningful<00:03:26.330> way<00:03:26.510> and<00:03:26.900> with<00:03:27.350> all

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
home in a meaningful way and with all

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.979 
home in a meaningful way and with all
that<00:03:27.590> because<00:03:28.100> then<00:03:28.489> it<00:03:28.640> is<00:03:28.790> unless<00:03:29.420> energy

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
that because then it is unless energy

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.199 
that because then it is unless energy
uses<00:03:30.440> and<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:30.920> fact<00:03:31.160> that<00:03:31.220> we<00:03:31.400> can<00:03:31.670> curve<00:03:32.000> the

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
uses and the fact that we can curve the

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.030 
uses and the fact that we can curve the
panel<00:03:32.630> we<00:03:33.020> thought<00:03:33.200> this<00:03:33.320> would<00:03:33.530> deliver<00:03:33.800> the

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
panel we thought this would deliver the

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.729 
panel we thought this would deliver the
ultimate<00:03:34.220> in<00:03:34.640> picture<00:03:34.880> quality<00:03:35.200> Frank<00:03:36.200> if<00:03:36.470> not

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
ultimate in picture quality Frank if not

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.430 
ultimate in picture quality Frank if not
all<00:03:36.920> LED<00:03:37.130> was<00:03:37.280> 15,000<00:03:38.150> I'm<00:03:38.480> even<00:03:38.930> scared<00:03:39.110> to

all LED was 15,000 I'm even scared to
