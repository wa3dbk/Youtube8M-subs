00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
should go back in and reverse fairly

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.459 
should go back in and reverse fairly
easily<00:02:26.280> this<00:02:27.239> is<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.599> old<00:02:27.840> one<00:02:28.079> I'm<00:02:28.290> putting

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:28.469 
easily this is the old one I'm putting

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:30.740 
easily this is the old one I'm putting
back<00:02:28.920> in<00:02:29.189> just<00:02:29.489> for<00:02:29.730> an<00:02:29.819> example<00:02:30.329> I<00:02:30.420> don't<00:02:30.599> have

back in just for an example I don't have

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.440 
back in just for an example I don't have
the<00:02:30.870> new<00:02:31.019> one<00:02:31.200> in<00:02:31.379> yet<00:02:31.620> but<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.819> new<00:02:33.030> one<00:02:33.239> will

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
the new one in yet but the new one will

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.149 
the new one in yet but the new one will
go<00:02:33.659> in<00:02:33.689> and<00:02:34.230> twist<00:02:34.829> in<00:02:35.840> counter<00:02:36.840> clockwise

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:37.159 
go in and twist in counter clockwise

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:40.149 
go in and twist in counter clockwise
once<00:02:38.159> a<00:02:38.340> twists<00:02:38.730> in<00:02:38.909> it'll<00:02:39.299> snap<00:02:39.569> in<00:02:39.629> place

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:40.159 
once a twists in it'll snap in place

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.979 
once a twists in it'll snap in place
once<00:02:41.159> it<00:02:41.340> snaps<00:02:41.640> in<00:02:41.909> place<00:02:42.239> the<00:02:42.540> first<00:02:42.780> thing

once it snaps in place the first thing

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.319 
once it snaps in place the first thing
to<00:02:43.109> do<00:02:43.260> is<00:02:43.470> check<00:02:43.739> and<00:02:44.040> make<00:02:44.189> sure<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.819> whole

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
to do is check and make sure the whole

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.229 
to do is check and make sure the whole
mechanism<00:02:46.049> works<00:02:46.430> after<00:02:47.430> you<00:02:47.519> find<00:02:47.819> out<00:02:48.000> that

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
mechanism works after you find out that

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.149 
mechanism works after you find out that
the<00:02:48.389> whole<00:02:48.599> mechanism<00:02:49.260> works<00:02:49.500> everything<00:02:50.040> is
