so in my opinion searing afterwards

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.149 
so in my opinion searing afterwards
which<00:06:12.930> completely<00:06:13.440> went<00:06:13.740> against<00:06:13.949> what<00:06:14.039> I

00:06:14.149 --> 00:06:14.159 
which completely went against what I

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:17.450 
which completely went against what I
thought<00:06:14.400> but<00:06:15.389> searing<00:06:15.840> afterwards<00:06:16.409> makes<00:06:17.310> a

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 
thought but searing afterwards makes a

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.670 
thought but searing afterwards makes a
