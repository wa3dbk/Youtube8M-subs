I'm not wanted on an optic nation

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.310

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
anymore so I'm being traded to team

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.490 
anymore so I'm being traded to team
envyus<00:00:19.640> so<00:00:20.640> basically<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.689> roster<00:00:22.050> for<00:00:22.080> m/v

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.490 
really get to make the teams that I
necessarily<00:01:00.300> wanted<00:01:01.020> per<00:01:01.170> se

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
necessarily wanted per se

I<00:01:01.530> was<00:01:01.859> very<00:01:02.010> limited<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.670> my<00:01:02.850> picks<00:01:03.329> of

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
I was very limited to my picks of

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.780 
I was very limited to my picks of
teammates<00:01:03.899> due<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.650> lot<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.430> different

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
teammates due to a lot of different

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.429 
teammates due to a lot of different
limitations<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.479> are<00:01:06.600> not<00:01:06.750> not<00:01:07.110> going<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.320> go

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
limitations that are not not going to go

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.320 
limitations that are not not going to go
into<00:01:07.710> but<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.490> was<00:01:08.580> just<00:01:08.729> really<00:01:08.909> hard<00:01:09.180> to

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
into but it was just really hard to

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.200 
into but it was just really hard to
create<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.689> lineup<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.110> was<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:11.159> was<00:01:11.729> extremely

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
create a lineup that was I was extremely

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.030 
create a lineup that was I was extremely
confident<00:01:12.900> I<00:01:13.020> guess<00:01:13.229> not<00:01:13.680> putting<00:01:13.979> my

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
confident I guess not putting my

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.710 
confident I guess not putting my
teammates<00:01:14.369> down<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:14.640> any<00:01:14.729> way<00:01:14.820> but<00:01:14.970> my

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
teammates down in any way but my

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.480 
teammates down in any way but my
mentality<00:01:16.080> compared<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.770> theirs<00:01:17.220> was

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
mentality compared to theirs was

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.850 
mentality compared to theirs was
obviously<00:01:17.970> not<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.330> same<00:01:18.560> you<00:01:19.560> could<00:01:19.680> just

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
obviously not the same you could just

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.350 
obviously not the same you could just
oxi<00:01:20.189> see<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.460> when<00:01:20.700> we<00:01:20.729> when<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.150> watch

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
warfare and just seemed like nothing was

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.740 
warfare and just seemed like nothing was
working<00:02:20.400> out<00:02:20.640> for<00:02:20.819> me<00:02:20.970> I<00:02:21.180> had<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.599> most

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
working out for me I had the most

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.500

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
dedication that I have ever had in Call

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.449 
dedication that I have ever had in Call
of<00:02:24.540> Duty<00:02:24.900> I<00:02:25.050> was<00:02:25.410> trying<00:02:25.680> so<00:02:25.890> hard<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:26.280> make<00:02:26.430> it

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
of Duty I was trying so hard to make it

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.460 
of Duty I was trying so hard to make it
work<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:27.000> it<00:02:27.270> just<00:02:27.480> didn't<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:27.959> that's<00:02:28.200> just

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
work and it just didn't and that's just

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.960 
work and it just didn't and that's just
sort<00:02:28.560> of<00:02:28.650> how<00:02:28.739> life<00:02:29.010> works<00:02:29.220> sometimes<00:02:29.489> I<00:02:29.790> guess

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
sort of how life works sometimes I guess

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.360 
sort of how life works sometimes I guess
but<00:02:30.540> anyways<00:02:30.780> it's<00:02:30.959> time<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.230> move<00:02:31.380> on

but anyways it's time to move on
time<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.180> get<00:02:33.300> better<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:33.870> is<00:02:34.140> what<00:02:34.290> it<00:02:34.380> is<00:02:34.500> a

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
time to get better it is what it is a

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.960 
time to get better it is what it is a
lot<00:02:34.920> of<00:02:34.980> people<00:02:35.160> don't<00:02:35.250> think<00:02:35.370> I'm<00:02:35.580> that<00:02:35.640> good

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970

at<00:02:36.060> this<00:02:36.180> game<00:02:36.390> due<00:02:36.630> to<00:02:36.660> all<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.560> poor<00:02:37.769> results

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
at this game due to all the poor results

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.430 
at this game due to all the poor results
on<00:02:38.459> nation<00:02:38.940> which<00:02:39.120> completely<00:02:39.540> is<00:02:39.750> you<00:02:40.349> know

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
on nation which completely is you know

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.050 
on nation which completely is you know
it's<00:02:40.650> logical<00:02:41.099> we<00:02:41.310> haven't<00:02:41.580> done<00:02:41.670> well<00:02:41.880> I

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
it's logical we haven't done well I

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.970 
it's logical we haven't done well I
haven't<00:02:42.480> put<00:02:42.660> up<00:02:42.750> this<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.440> numbers<00:02:43.769> that<00:02:43.920> I

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
haven't put up this the numbers that I

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.070 
haven't put up this the numbers that I
need<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:44.459> and<00:02:44.670> that<00:02:45.150> is<00:02:45.300> what<00:02:45.330> it<00:02:45.540> is<00:02:45.840> what<00:02:45.989> it

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
need to and that is what it is what it

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.270 
need to and that is what it is what it
is<00:02:46.200> I<00:02:46.350> think<00:02:46.440> we<00:02:46.530> need<00:02:46.620> to<00:02:46.799> get<00:02:46.890> better<00:02:47.069> and

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
is I think we need to get better and

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.250 
is I think we need to get better and
hopefully<00:02:47.640> going<00:02:48.090> into<00:02:48.330> this<00:02:48.450> new<00:02:48.630> roster<00:02:48.870> we

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
hopefully going into this new roster we

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.490 
hopefully going into this new roster we
can<00:02:49.410> make<00:02:49.769> some<00:02:49.950> noise<00:02:50.299> the<00:02:51.350> team<00:02:52.350> envyus

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
can make some noise the team envyus

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.680 
can make some noise the team envyus
line-up<00:02:53.069> was<00:02:53.220> four<00:02:53.700> in<00:02:53.880> eighth<00:02:54.150> in<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.390> league

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
line-up was four in eighth in the league

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.270 
line-up was four in eighth in the league
so<00:02:54.900> we<00:02:55.019> really<00:02:55.290> needed<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.560> do<00:02:55.680> our<00:02:55.799> best<00:02:56.040> to

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
so we really needed to do our best to

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.400 
so we really needed to do our best to
bring<00:02:56.400> that<00:02:56.640> record<00:02:56.940> back<00:02:57.090> up<00:02:57.269> to<00:02:57.390> 500<00:02:57.989> as<00:02:58.110> soon

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410

as<00:02:58.530> possible<00:02:58.980> I'm<00:02:59.220> really<00:02:59.849> tired<00:03:00.060> of<00:03:00.269> being

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
as possible I'm really tired of being

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.660 
as possible I'm really tired of being
stressed<00:03:00.780> out<00:03:01.049> on<00:03:01.230> a<00:03:01.260> last-place<00:03:01.709> team<00:03:02.190> we're

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
stressed out on a last-place team we're

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.339 
stressed out on a last-place team we're
