00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.140
 however an interesting paradox from one game 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.510
 judging by the trailers 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.560
 and promises developers expect a miracle and 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.210
 breakthrough in the genre 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.060
 in the end getting a complete disappointment 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.640
 from the other you do not expect anything 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.040
 except as mediocre doubtful 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.410
 qualities and playing it you realize that 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.599
 everything is exactly the opposite is unknown 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.489
 who is to blame our marketers 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.800
 fantasy or moon position 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.530
 regarding the sun but the fact remains 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.899
 It’s a fact better to lower the bar in advance. 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.510
 pleasantly surprised than disappointed in 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.090
 that our hopes were not justified measures 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.370
 hole sauce aspect refers precisely to 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.410
 categories of pleasant surprises 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.630
 to tell the truth we expected from her 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.880
 the next postrelushek with shelters and 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.890
 rolls in ghostly scenery but 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.440
 what was our surprise when 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.810
 faced with something completely different and 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.450
 ordered is a real detective 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.830
 albeit in such a non-standard setting 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.140
 what could be more interesting 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.450
 investigating your own murder 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.790
 better motivation and not come up with a plot 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.040
 clings from the very first seconds and one 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.770
 the riddle engenders several 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.050
 new because of what come off very well 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.330
 difficult especially as search of the 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.640
 the killer case is not limited to how 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.190
 it turned out the city of salt is not as simple as 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.680
 it seems and its inhabitants are full of their 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.050
 skeletons in the closet and being a ghost 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.060
 curtain can reveal secrets Example 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.850
 it turns out that a kind grandmother with 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.610
 grandfather killed the neighbor addict for 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.950
 that she was having a noisy party alone 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.560
 maniac to death crashed watching his 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.330
 victim and now chase her in your 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.030
 ghostly appearance of our eyes 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.460
 many scenes and interesting 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.470
 events and in the world of the living and in 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.090
 the world of the dead to some of the ghosts we 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.340
 can even help find peace 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.500
 investigated the cause of their death 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.659
 the living can only be eavesdropped yes 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.880
 occasionally scare poltergeist kimi 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.100
 tricks that way too pretty 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.990
 fascinating as we go 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.890
 can also get to know 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.440
 the main character 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.630
 watching scenes from his past and 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.910
 just memories protagonist 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.100
 turned out colorful and memorable 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.470
 thanks to what you start really 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.750
 empathize with the writers completely 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.060
 coped with the task for what 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.010
 im thanks a lot in terms of 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.590
 gameplay everything is also very, very 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.140
 interesting but worth noting that lovers 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.810
 action can immediately pass by because 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.880
 how exactly is it not here this is detective a 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.610
 not some kind of action movie most of the time 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.860
 we are looking for clues and trying to build them in 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.440
 logical chain of mechanics something 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.420
 reminds war or but here we go still 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.250
 further thanks to our ghostly 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.769
 abilities we can move in 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.230
 absolutely in any person overhearing 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.540
 his thoughts through his eyes and peeping 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.000
 also bumping it into interesting 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.400
 guesses it all makes it easier task 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.709
 to collect evidence and compare them and 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.110
 determine which evidence is important and which is not 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.180
 we must independently in the role of enemies 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.880
 there are demons who desperately 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.550
 it takes your soul to be incredible 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.950
 important matters fight them is impossible and 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.560
 we have only two solutions 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.959
 first just run away and hide 2 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.390
 sneak up from the back and do the act 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.220
 exorcism one wrong move and 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.040
 will have to resort to the first method 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.780
 these demons are not as common 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.510
 only needed to dilute 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.670
 monotone study of Sayama on the subject 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.440
 those or other interesting more in 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.780
 Generally and not need despite 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.820
 darkness gray setting 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.829
 wander through the back streets very interesting 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.110
 absolutely not annoying level design 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:45.120
 executed in such a way that despite 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.340
 what we can pass through walls 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.060
 in many places we still meet 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.280
 barriers 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.440
 it can be like pools of demons 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.459
 who will gladly pull us to 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.470
 myself on the light 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:58.410
 or so-called ghostly 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.630
 prints of wall objects and other traces 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.760
 material wealth from the past which 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.100
 ghost around the can not be so 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.200
 way we are forced to seek solutions to those 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.120
 or other difficulties somewhere need 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.950
 tricky to get around somewhere to move in 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.840
 man and somewhere even in a cat 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.180
 management of which release 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.859
 she's very interesting thanks to everything 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.919
 this gameplay was not only 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.269
 fascinating but most importantly 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:23.550
 unique this is one of the few projects 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.470
 during the passage of which is not 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.840
 there is a feeling of secondary 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.770
 technically no breakthrough 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.350
 is observed 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:34.050
 the game runs on proven over the years Andrea 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.760
 engine 3 what for such dark decorations 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.919
 and measured gameplay is quite 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.110
 everything looks pretty stylish and 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.680
 fully complies with all canons 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.900
 noir 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.120
 Is that not enough femme fatale 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.220
 familiar to us understanding but there is 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.830
 gay maniac flaws should 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.470
 include perhaps some stupidity 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.660
 big city ​​living representatives 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.060
 part of the time they resemble nothing 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.430
 making mannequins to the world of dead souls 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.889
 aspect relied on intriguing 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.990
 plot and rather non-standard gameplay 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:05.660
 so the game was just 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.610
 great that's just unfortunately 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.590
 sales does all the same advertising from what 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.630
 this beautiful detective is unlikely 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.060
 it will turn out to be a hit but not one 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.720
 the buyer will not be disappointed sooner 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.600
 vice versa 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.940
 from us the game gets 9 points out of 10 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.370
 let it not hit the season and not revolution 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.080
 but it’s a project with a soul that’s not 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.380
 will give you a break from the screen on 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:31.110
 several unforgettable hours 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:33.150
 always with you time video game do not live 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:36.150
 live many lives by one life 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:40.610
 play games watch movies listen 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.610
 good music to new meetings
