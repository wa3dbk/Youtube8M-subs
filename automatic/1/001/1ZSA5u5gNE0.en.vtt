this<00:00:16.939> is<00:00:17.090> the<00:00:17.210> finished<00:00:17.480> painting<00:00:17.689> just

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.020 
this is the finished painting just

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.890 
this is the finished painting just
before<00:00:18.380> delivery<00:00:18.860> to<00:00:19.099> the<00:00:19.220> client<00:00:19.610> I

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:19.900 
before delivery to the client I

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.880 
before delivery to the client I
photographed<00:00:20.900> it<00:00:21.050> against<00:00:21.410> the<00:00:21.470> bookshelves

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
photographed it against the bookshelves

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.500 
photographed it against the bookshelves
so<00:00:22.010> you<00:00:22.130> can<00:00:22.250> get<00:00:22.369> some<00:00:22.550> sense<00:00:22.760> of<00:00:22.940> scale<00:00:23.090> I

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 
so you can get some sense of scale I

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.660 
so you can get some sense of scale I
think<00:00:24.199> you<00:00:24.500> can<00:00:24.680> see<00:00:24.830> how<00:00:24.920> thick<00:00:25.190> the<00:00:25.310> painting

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
think you can see how thick the painting

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.480 
think you can see how thick the painting
is<00:00:25.789> and<00:00:26.029> how<00:00:26.359> reflective<00:00:26.890> it's<00:00:27.890> shiny<00:00:28.160> because

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
is and how reflective it's shiny because

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.519 
is and how reflective it's shiny because
I<00:00:28.609> use<00:00:28.760> a<00:00:28.789> lot<00:00:29.029> of<00:00:29.060> varnish<00:00:29.480> in<00:00:29.630> my<00:00:29.750> medium<00:00:30.170> and

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
I use a lot of varnish in my medium and

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.979 
I use a lot of varnish in my medium and
I<00:00:30.710> use<00:00:30.859> a<00:00:30.890> lot<00:00:31.070> of<00:00:31.220> medium<00:00:31.609> in<00:00:31.789> my<00:00:31.910> paint<00:00:32.210> the

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
I use a lot of medium in my paint the

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:34.330 
I use a lot of medium in my paint the
result<00:00:33.290> of<00:00:33.410> this<00:00:33.530> is<00:00:33.739> that<00:00:33.769> my<00:00:33.980> paint<00:00:34.250> is

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
result of this is that my paint is

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.219 
result of this is that my paint is
fairly<00:00:34.640> viscous<00:00:35.239> and<00:00:35.449> if<00:00:35.600> you<00:00:35.720> look<00:00:35.870> carefully

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:36.229 
fairly viscous and if you look carefully

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:38.229 
fairly viscous and if you look carefully
and<00:00:36.710> see<00:00:36.890> how<00:00:36.979> it<00:00:37.100> runs<00:00:37.250> down<00:00:37.519> the<00:00:37.670> canvas<00:00:37.909> in

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
and see how it runs down the canvas in

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:38.979 
and see how it runs down the canvas in
some<00:00:38.449> areas

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
some areas

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.200 
some areas
I<00:00:39.019> like<00:00:39.800> the<00:00:39.920> unpredictable<00:00:40.550> quality<00:00:41.000> of<00:00:41.059> this

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
I like the unpredictable quality of this

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.549 
I like the unpredictable quality of this
technique<00:00:41.629> and<00:00:41.870> I've<00:00:41.960> been<00:00:42.110> using<00:00:42.260> it<00:00:42.500> for

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
technique and I've been using it for

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:48.969 
technique and I've been using it for
years<00:00:46.870> here's<00:00:47.870> the<00:00:48.019> client<00:00:48.350> provided<00:00:48.769> source

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.570 

I've<00:05:34.930> decided<00:05:35.290> on<00:05:35.530> the<00:05:35.620> red<00:05:35.800> since<00:05:36.340> it<00:05:36.460> makes

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
I've decided on the red since it makes

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.520 
I've decided on the red since it makes
the<00:05:36.700> neutral<00:05:37.090> tones<00:05:37.360> of<00:05:37.570> chives<00:05:37.810> for<00:05:38.140> pop<00:05:38.500> a

the neutral tones of chives for pop a

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:39.900 
the neutral tones of chives for pop a
bit<00:05:38.890> and<00:05:39.160> because<00:05:39.400> they<00:05:39.520> adds<00:05:39.640> a<00:05:39.760> bit<00:05:39.880> of

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:39.910 
bit and because they adds a bit of

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.070 
bit and because they adds a bit of
tension<00:05:40.240> to<00:05:40.480> the<00:05:40.570> painting

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080

bring the red around to refer and if you

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.470 
bring the red around to refer and if you
look<00:05:51.250> closely<00:05:51.610> you'll<00:05:52.000> see<00:05:52.210> that<00:05:52.360> I'm

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:52.480 
look closely you'll see that I'm

as I'm going to read the figure this

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.550 
as I'm going to read the figure this
helps<00:05:58.450> to<00:05:58.540> give<00:05:58.690> the<00:05:58.720> portrait<00:05:59.200> sense<00:05:59.440> of

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.650 

this<00:06:06.160> shot<00:06:06.430> is<00:06:06.610> pretty<00:06:07.000> much<00:06:07.120> like<00:06:07.330> the<00:06:07.390> last

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660 
this shot is pretty much like the last

one though without the glare that you

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.710 
one though without the glare that you

notice<00:06:13.540> the<00:06:13.660> attention<00:06:13.750> I<00:06:14.140> lavished<00:06:14.500> on<00:06:14.590> the

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:14.710 
notice the attention I lavished on the

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:19.560 
notice the attention I lavished on the

this point the painting is finally
covered<00:06:21.310> and<00:06:21.520> it<00:06:21.850> might<00:06:22.030> look<00:06:22.510> finished<00:06:23.020> but

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 
covered and it might look finished but

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.730 
covered and it might look finished but
it's<00:06:23.950> not<00:06:24.300> pain<00:06:25.300> is<00:06:25.420> extremely<00:06:25.660> running<00:06:26.350> and

down the canvas I also went back into
one<00:06:32.560> or<00:06:32.680> two<00:06:32.710> areas<00:06:33.010> that<00:06:33.370> I'll<00:06:33.460> paint<00:06:33.700> point

top of her head in fact there was a

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:58.079 
top of her head in fact there was a
desperate<00:06:56.919> moment<00:06:57.069> when<00:06:57.339> I<00:06:57.369> feared<00:06:57.669> that<00:06:57.759> this

00:06:58.079 --> 00:06:58.089 
desperate moment when I feared that this

00:06:58.089 --> 00:06:59.369 
desperate moment when I feared that this
section<00:06:58.509> of<00:06:58.599> the<00:06:58.659> painting<00:06:58.869> would<00:06:59.079> descend

00:06:59.369 --> 00:06:59.379 
section of the painting would descend

00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:01.229 
section of the painting would descend
