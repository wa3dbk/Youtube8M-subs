00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
so for extra deck we're playing three

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.750 
so for extra deck we're playing three
copies<00:03:14.569> brother<00:03:15.530> the<00:03:15.769> fire<00:03:15.920> fist<00:03:16.160> hugger<00:03:16.459> King

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
copies brother the fire fist hugger King

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.880 
copies brother the fire fist hugger King
at<00:03:17.000> some<00:03:17.599> point<00:03:17.810> I<00:03:17.930> was<00:03:18.049> trying<00:03:18.170> out<00:03:18.440> just<00:03:18.680> two

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
at some point I was trying out just two

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.440 
at some point I was trying out just two
but<00:03:19.250> there's<00:03:19.489> been<00:03:19.670> a<00:03:19.700> lot<00:03:19.879> of<00:03:19.910> times<00:03:20.150> and

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
but there's been a lot of times and

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.930 
but there's been a lot of times and
instances<00:03:21.019> where<00:03:21.290> I<00:03:21.590> needed<00:03:22.220> that<00:03:22.370> third<00:03:22.700> one

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
instances where I needed that third one

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.339 
instances where I needed that third one
to<00:03:23.060> go<00:03:23.180> into<00:03:23.480> and<00:03:23.660> it<00:03:23.720> wasn't<00:03:23.989> in<00:03:24.049> the<00:03:24.109> extra

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349 
to go into and it wasn't in the extra

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:25.690 
to go into and it wasn't in the extra
deck<00:03:24.500> so<00:03:24.680> I<00:03:24.739> just<00:03:24.920> went<00:03:25.040> ahead<00:03:25.099> and<00:03:25.220> put<00:03:25.459> the

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
deck so I just went ahead and put the

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.699 
deck so I just went ahead and put the
third<00:03:25.910> copy<00:03:26.120> back<00:03:26.450> in<00:03:26.690> I<00:03:26.900> think<00:03:27.260> it<00:03:27.380> works<00:03:27.560> out

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
third copy back in I think it works out

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:28.960 
third copy back in I think it works out
a<00:03:27.739> lot<00:03:27.980> better<00:03:28.130> with<00:03:28.370> it<00:03:28.489> because<00:03:28.579> there<00:03:28.819> is<00:03:28.940> a

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
a lot better with it because there is a

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.300 
a lot better with it because there is a
lot<00:03:29.180> of<00:03:29.209> times<00:03:29.540> where<00:03:29.930> you<00:03:30.799> just<00:03:30.950> need<00:03:31.099> to<00:03:31.190> go

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
lot of times where you just need to go

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.920 
lot of times where you just need to go
into<00:03:31.459> that<00:03:31.549> third<00:03:31.910> one<00:03:32.150> it's<00:03:32.450> kind<00:03:32.630> of<00:03:32.660> like<00:03:32.810> an

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
into that third one it's kind of like an

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.500 
into that third one it's kind of like an
otk<00:03:33.470> enabler<00:03:34.099> because<00:03:34.880> it<00:03:35.000> allows<00:03:35.180> you<00:03:35.299> to<00:03:35.389> get

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
otk enabler because it allows you to get

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.539 
otk enabler because it allows you to get
the<00:03:35.630> extra<00:03:35.959> tin<00:03:36.139> super<00:03:36.440> tanky<00:03:36.889> out<00:03:37.010> so<00:03:37.340> you<00:03:37.430> can
