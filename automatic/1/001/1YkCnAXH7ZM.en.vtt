00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.569
 abandoned school I always know not 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.420
 loved the school there I was somehow not by 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.790
 myself a couple of years ago we are with my friend 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.519
 just decided to fool around and get in 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.640
 old abandoned school but it was 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.850
 our biggest mistake is going inside 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.100
 the doors slammed at the beginning we thought 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.490
 what is a joke and started shouting hey 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.760
 let us out what the jokes are but nobody 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.369
 I did not respond with a friend looked at each other and 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.190
 not finding an explanation went inside hope 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.079
 find windows or doors to get out 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.840
 from there 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.070
 but for some reason all the windows were boarded up and the 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.460
 another door 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:48.510
 we did not find how suddenly we heard crying 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.520
 crying girls we had nothing to do 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.760
 hope that we will find help we went to 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.789
 these sounds beating the whole school we came in 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.760
 female toilet all the walls were red on 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.129
 balu was blood pushing the other you said 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.250
 what went crazy let's go out of here let's look 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.930
 exit but he just shook his head and went 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.970
 forward 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:13.159
 pushed the stall door we saw a girl 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:16.069
 ten years old with a girl like a girl 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.960
 but something was pushing me away from her 

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:21.799
 told me to hold on 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.960
 away I wondered what was doing here 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:27.350
 this little girl is alone 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:31.159
 in the middle of that bloody room I said 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.799
 to a friend and I'm leaving here but he glanced at 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.229
 I asked and that we will not help her 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.599
 when we got closer to the girls 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:42.590
 stopped crying she understood her 

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:46.450
 head smiled and let us know 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.979
 let's play but also a crazy look her eyes 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:53.780
 for some reason I started to get sick terribly 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:56.060
 head i ran out into the hallway and i ran 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.629
 I don't remember how unconscious but woke up 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.610
 I was already out of school in my hands 

00:01:59.629 --> 00:02:05.430
 a note in which it was written 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:09.500
 you friend will stay with me we will 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:12.480
 play for the rest of his life for the rest of his life 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.240
 I still do not understand what happened in that 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.780
 day and try not to remember 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.780
 this moment
