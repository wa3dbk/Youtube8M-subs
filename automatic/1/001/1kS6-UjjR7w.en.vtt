 US Bancorp is doing well 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.870
 the cunning 50 50 USB 2 0 with a lot of work in front of the door 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:25.730
 record player 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.090
 with a startup moment of 3com a 5 kilo of bread centimeter that is with the 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.090
 Device You can not only make perfect things about it

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.159
 please have highest stability and good sound 10

 the BND 47 50 clock stand 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.380

 save as threw or burn on CD the group like her very briefly the 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.199
 Features of the GD 47 50 USD image 

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:13.619
 I once have the city stop button second of long-range turntables 

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:16.209
 want to make vertical 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.400
 I have a needle lighting the so-called valley headed so I always 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.199
 very much would like to get positioned you always busy 

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:26.199
 that may not be so ideal 

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:29.129
 and there you can of course the three settings of the 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.949
 Speed â€‹â€‹I once dominated 33 Ronse 

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:35.540
 Kurzak clarify for the number one 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.989
 Max is sensible cinematic 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.079
 Of course, for the single-stay small cells it's 45 rpm 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.099
 and for those of you who still have shellac records at home both 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:52.069
 Buttons pressed at the same time but the technicians from 78 4 1 percent

 we want to be in Brest 

00:02:57.899 --> 00:03:00.549
 As the name indicates 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.379
 in spite of the turntable turntable vignette 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:05.159
 presses 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:08.159
 and back in the other direction if you're fine 

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:16.799
 Advertising copy licks you have the option between three settings 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.689
 if I have ten percent 20% and 50% 

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:23.099
 that means you can now here 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:24.679
 with the patch 

00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:27.679
 Pixel Act to ten percent 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.180
 the Quartz Lock 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.929
 I have to say too 

00:03:32.929 --> 00:03:35.929
 after plus-minus ten percent spread over the kitsch 

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:39.479
 the same at 20 plus minus 20 percent 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:44.720
 under so-called Full Tower Bridge Plusminus 50 points 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:52.579
 No 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.059
 there we were still the Quartz Lock 

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:58.039
 with activated the type is turned off later 

00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:00.729
 that means when the record is up and running again in Deauville 

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:03.729
 has taken 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.840
 DAPD 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.840
 from 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:28.090
 the turnaround at the Degi 47 50 o'clock is yesterday's first with the Thuner 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.610
 when I'm behind 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.379
 can adjust in height 

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:34.309
 that makes sense if I can use different systems 

00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:37.759
 Osisko who wants to do exactly mine is mine 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:40.199
 adjust and adjust 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:42.849
 That Calvin is on the right side 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:45.839
 and want it to come up to three adjustable further we have that 

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:48.839
 Counterweight that is of course also infinitely adjustable 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:51.370
 and we have the engine on 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.930
 Barton on his 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.930
 that is, if he has the record running and does the motto 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.479
 what has to happen 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:02.409
 Helmut Thoma at that time that the so-called power of hidden 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:04.660
 you can also incorporate well in transition 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.110
 press again 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.949
 Engines come up 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:10.879
 Ulm 

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:13.879
 Copenhagen 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:21.470
 golden bells on by witnesses very short - and him as a system which 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.939
 in the 47 50 m is included 

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:27.599
 adjust properly so that the Knodel also stays good in the track usually 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:30.849
 and you just have to 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:33.849
 the weight should then turn backwards 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.360
 Tuna has remained less vague 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:49.279
 then the wreath 

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:52.430
 not the whole weight just turn the wreath to zero 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.590
 that means I currently have 0 grams of weight on the north and he realized that 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.069
 when he goes 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:05:59.900
 Emphasis 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.020
 and then I can put the Eliane pad weight on the system between three 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.819
 and fight four 

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:09.689
 just by the weight 

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:11.499
 to turn left 

00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:13.229
 down to the Scala 3 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:14.360
 Gram appears 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.389
 now the weight is set correctly on the 

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:20.389
 Orginal Lada and now you can see 

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:29.499
 Bishkek 

00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:32.499

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.740

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:56.830
 Bangkok dpa 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:57.990
 there 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.990
 Currency traders have 

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:32.049
