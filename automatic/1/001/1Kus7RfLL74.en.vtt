00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.600 
let's jump on to the first tip a lot of
you<00:00:31.470> might<00:00:31.679> not<00:00:31.800> know<00:00:31.859> this<00:00:32.189> but<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.489> actually

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
you might not know this but I actually

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.310 
you might not know this but I actually
play<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:32.969> lot<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.480> xerath<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.020> one<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.230> the

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
play a lot of xerath and one of the

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.930 
play a lot of xerath and one of the
biggest<00:00:34.530> problems<00:00:35.010> with<00:00:35.250> him<00:00:35.520> is<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:35.760> I

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
biggest problems with him is that I

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.490 
biggest problems with him is that I
would<00:00:36.149> run<00:00:36.360> out<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.540> mana<00:00:36.780> when<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.079> couldn't

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
would run out of mana when I couldn't

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.530 
would run out of mana when I couldn't
use<00:00:37.680> my<00:00:37.710> passive<00:00:38.399> so<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.820> situations<00:00:39.390> you

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
use my passive so the situations you

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.000 
use my passive so the situations you
can't<00:00:39.809> use<00:00:39.989> your<00:00:40.020> passive<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.590> really<00:00:40.829> like

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
can't use your passive is really like

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.650 
can't use your passive is really like
when<00:00:41.190> you're<00:00:41.280> pushing<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.940> tower<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.420> fit

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
when you're pushing to the tower you fit

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.000 
when you're pushing to the tower you fit
the<00:00:42.780> way<00:00:42.930> there's<00:00:43.200> just<00:00:43.379> nothing<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.710> hit

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
the way there's just nothing to hit

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.529 
the way there's just nothing to hit
anymore<00:00:44.250> or<00:00:44.640> when<00:00:44.789> you're<00:00:44.910> having<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.149> farm

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
anymore or when you're having to farm

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.000 
anymore or when you're having to farm
with<00:00:45.660> your<00:00:45.780> spell's<00:00:46.079> in<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.469> really<00:00:46.800> difficult

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
with your spell's in a really difficult

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.250 
with your spell's in a really difficult
matchup<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:48.000> in<00:00:48.120> these<00:00:48.239> situations<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:49.020> can't

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
matchup so in these situations you can't

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.810 
matchup so in these situations you can't
need<00:00:49.410> your<00:00:49.530> passive<00:00:49.890> right<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.280> really<00:00:50.489> you

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
need your passive right and really you

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.340 
need your passive right and really you
want<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.059> be<00:00:51.149> using<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.690> every<00:00:51.989> single<00:00:52.199> time

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
want to be using it every single time

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.290 
want to be using it every single time
that<00:00:52.680> it's<00:00:52.829> up<00:00:53.039> so<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.399> trick<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:53.850> found

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
that it's up so the trick that I found

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.209 
that it's up so the trick that I found
was<00:00:54.539> walking<00:00:54.930> back<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.230> my<00:00:55.260> Raptor<00:00:55.620> saw<00:00:56.039> my

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
was walking back to my Raptor saw my

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.250 
was walking back to my Raptor saw my
chickens<00:00:56.670> warding<00:00:57.270> over<00:00:57.480> with<00:00:57.600> my<00:00:57.719> trinket

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
chickens warding over with my trinket

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.619 
chickens warding over with my trinket
and<00:00:58.379> altering<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.219> use<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.550> passive<00:00:59.760> remember

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
and altering to use the passive remember

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.029 
and altering to use the passive remember
as<00:01:00.690> well<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.199> higher<00:01:01.410> level<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.770> are

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
as well that the higher level you are

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.799 
as well that the higher level you are
the<00:01:02.250> more<00:01:02.399> money<00:01:02.640> you're<00:01:02.820> gonna<00:01:03.000> get<00:01:03.210> back<00:01:03.539> so

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
the more money you're gonna get back so

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.539 
the more money you're gonna get back so
it<00:01:03.870> actually<00:01:03.960> becomes<00:01:04.350> more<00:01:04.680> useful<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.339> guess

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
it actually becomes more useful I guess

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.429 
it actually becomes more useful I guess
the<00:01:05.729> later<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.119> goes<00:01:06.270> into<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.689> game<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.170> in

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
the later it goes into the game and in

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.170 
the later it goes into the game and in
these<00:01:07.680> clips<00:01:07.950> I'm<00:01:08.159> pretty<00:01:08.400> low<00:01:08.549> level<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.090> it

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
these clips I'm pretty low level so it

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.820 
these clips I'm pretty low level so it
might<00:01:09.299> not<00:01:09.360> seem<00:01:09.720> like<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.930> lot<00:01:10.229> but<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:10.590> does

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
might not seem like a lot but it does

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.950 
might not seem like a lot but it does
actually<00:01:11.159> add<00:01:11.549> up<00:01:11.580> now<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.450> useful<00:01:12.840> on

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
actually add up now it is useful on

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.539 
actually add up now it is useful on
other<00:01:13.229> champions<00:01:13.770> especially<00:01:14.189> someone<00:01:14.490> like

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
other champions especially someone like

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.370 
other champions especially someone like
Vlad<00:01:14.909> as<00:01:15.150> well<00:01:15.360> it's<00:01:15.540> really<00:01:15.960> good<00:01:16.110> on<00:01:16.140> him

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
Vlad as well it's really good on him

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.080 
Vlad as well it's really good on him
when<00:01:16.530> he<00:01:16.590> gets<00:01:16.680> his<00:01:16.890> hextech<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.700> couple<00:01:17.939> of

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
when he gets his hextech and a couple of

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.850 
when he gets his hextech and a couple of
stacks<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.479> his<00:01:18.570> eb<00:01:19.020> cuz<00:01:19.140> if<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.290> can't<00:01:19.650> reach

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
stacks of his eb cuz if you can't reach

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.499 
stacks of his eb cuz if you can't reach
the<00:01:19.890> wave<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.520> use<00:01:20.700> your<00:01:20.880> queue<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.330> heal

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
the wave to use your queue and to heal

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.090 
the wave to use your queue and to heal
yourself<00:01:21.930> then<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.200> just<00:01:22.409> run<00:01:22.680> back<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.009> the

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
yourself then you just run back to the

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.280 
yourself then you just run back to the
chickens<00:01:23.520> your<00:01:23.790> ward<00:01:23.970> over<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.630> heal<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.229> you

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
chickens your ward over you heal and you

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.920 
chickens your ward over you heal and you
run<00:01:25.470> back<00:01:25.500> into<00:01:25.799> Lane<00:01:26.119> the<00:01:27.119> next<00:01:27.360> tip<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.540> for

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
run back into Lane the next tip is for

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.600 
run back into Lane the next tip is for
Jax<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.439> we're<00:01:28.530> gonna<00:01:28.619> be<00:01:28.770> looking<00:01:29.070> at<00:01:29.220> his<00:01:29.460> e

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
Jax and we're gonna be looking at his e

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.460 
Jax and we're gonna be looking at his e
specifically<00:01:30.570> we're<00:01:30.750> gonna<00:01:30.840> be<00:01:31.049> looking<00:01:31.380> at

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
specifically we're gonna be looking at

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.590 
specifically we're gonna be looking at
the<00:01:31.799> bonus<00:01:32.340> damage<00:01:32.549> component<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.479> the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
the bonus damage component of it the

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.450 
the bonus damage component of it the
part<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:33.930> I'm<00:01:33.990> highlighting<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:34.950> now<00:01:35.310> is

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
part that I'm highlighting of it now is

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.310 
part that I'm highlighting of it now is
he<00:01:35.670> has<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.880> base<00:01:36.180> damage<00:01:36.689> but<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:36.930> can<00:01:37.229> be

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
he has a base damage but that can be

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.710 
he has a base damage but that can be
increased<00:01:37.710> by<00:01:37.829> 20%<00:01:38.310> for<00:01:38.850> each<00:01:38.939> attack<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.600> he

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
increased by 20% for each attack that he

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.230 
increased by 20% for each attack that he
absorbs<00:01:40.259> up<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.710> hundred<00:01:41.189> percent<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:42.000> doing

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
absorbs up to a hundred percent so doing

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.999 
absorbs up to a hundred percent so doing
this<00:01:42.360> little<00:01:42.570> trick<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:42.990> going<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.439> double<00:01:43.829> if

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
this little trick is going to double if

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.920 
this little trick is going to double if
not<00:01:44.040> more<00:01:44.460> your<00:01:44.579> damage<00:01:44.939> output<00:01:45.149> from<00:01:45.600> your<00:01:45.659> e

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
not more your damage output from your e

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.840 
not more your damage output from your e
which<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.170> especially<00:01:46.649> useful<00:01:47.070> in<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.520> early

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
which is especially useful in the early

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.760 
which is especially useful in the early
levels<00:01:48.180> when<00:01:48.360> you're<00:01:48.509> trading<00:01:48.780> in<00:01:49.020> Lane<00:01:49.229> so

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
levels when you're trading in Lane so

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.020 
levels when you're trading in Lane so
the<00:01:49.860> trick<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.250> we<00:01:50.430> need<00:01:50.549> at<00:01:50.640> least<00:01:50.670> five

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
the trick is that we need at least five

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.850 
the trick is that we need at least five
autos<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.659> absorb<00:01:52.020> right<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.530> easiest

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
autos to absorb right and the easiest

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.740 
autos to absorb right and the easiest
way<00:01:53.009> of<00:01:53.130> doing<00:01:53.430> this<00:01:53.579> is<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.880> walk<00:01:54.360> up<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.600> the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
way of doing this is to walk up to the

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.929 
way of doing this is to walk up to the
enemy<00:01:54.899> laner<00:01:55.259> attack<00:01:55.890> them<00:01:56.070> first<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.640> then

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
enemy laner attack them first and then

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.090 
enemy laner attack them first and then
use<00:01:57.270> your<00:01:57.299> E<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:58.229> when<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.409> auto<00:01:58.560> attack<00:01:58.860> first

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
use your E so when you auto attack first

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.620 
use your E so when you auto attack first
around<00:01:59.430> minions<00:01:59.820> you'll<00:01:59.969> see<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.270> all<00:02:00.420> the

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
around minions you'll see that all the

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.870 
around minions you'll see that all the
minions<00:02:00.930> around<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.590> aggro<00:02:02.100> onto<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:02.729> and

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
minions around you aggro onto you and

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.100 
minions around you aggro onto you and
that<00:02:03.000> means<00:02:03.149> they're<00:02:03.479> stacking<00:02:03.960> up<00:02:04.079> the

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
that means they're stacking up the

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.289 
that means they're stacking up the
damaged<00:02:04.530> part<00:02:04.829> of<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.070> e<00:02:05.369> they're<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.090> five

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
damaged part of the e they're the five

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.449 
damaged part of the e they're the five
autos<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:06.899> need<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.229> absorb<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.710> 100%

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
autos that you need to absorb to 100%

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.190 
autos that you need to absorb to 100%
and<00:02:08.640> it's<00:02:08.759> just<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:08.970> really<00:02:09.270> easy<00:02:09.390> way<00:02:09.810> of

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
and it's just a really easy way of

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.010 
and it's just a really easy way of
guaranteeing<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.860> top<00:02:11.190> damage

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
guaranteeing that top damage

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.810 
guaranteeing that top damage
so<00:02:12.350> the<00:02:12.440> final<00:02:12.710> tip<00:02:12.830> is<00:02:13.010> going<00:02:13.250> to<00:02:13.340> be<00:02:13.460> for

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
so the final tip is going to be for

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.460 
so the final tip is going to be for
hecarim<00:02:14.240> and<00:02:14.450> by<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.780> way<00:02:14.960> hecarim<00:02:15.290> is

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
hecarim and by the way hecarim is

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.050 
hecarim and by the way hecarim is
actually<00:02:15.740> still<00:02:15.950> pretty<00:02:15.980> decent<00:02:16.310> top<00:02:16.850> lane

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
actually still pretty decent top lane

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.520 
actually still pretty decent top lane
and<00:02:17.330> in<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.630> jungle<00:02:18.020> he's<00:02:18.170> just<00:02:18.320> kind<00:02:18.500> of

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
and in the jungle he's just kind of

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.170 
and in the jungle he's just kind of
falling<00:02:18.860> out<00:02:18.980> of<00:02:19.010> favor<00:02:19.340> but<00:02:19.700> he's<00:02:19.790> definitely

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
falling out of favor but he's definitely

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.150 
falling out of favor but he's definitely
still<00:02:20.270> a<00:02:20.450> viable<00:02:20.690> champ<00:02:21.110> now<00:02:21.470> the<00:02:21.530> tip<00:02:21.770> is<00:02:21.980> with

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
still a viable champ now the tip is with

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.310 
still a viable champ now the tip is with
his<00:02:22.310> devastating<00:02:22.640> charge<00:02:23.360> his<00:02:23.660> either<00:02:23.990> thing

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
his devastating charge his either thing

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.990 
his devastating charge his either thing
that<00:02:24.500> makes<00:02:24.650> him<00:02:24.800> go<00:02:25.010> faster<00:02:25.520> right<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:25.940> he

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
that makes him go faster right and he

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000 
that makes him go faster right and he
can<00:02:26.120> actually<00:02:26.240> use<00:02:26.720> that<00:02:26.750> to<00:02:27.140> jump<00:02:27.350> over<00:02:27.740> most

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
can actually use that to jump over most

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.920 
can actually use that to jump over most
wolves<00:02:28.370> in<00:02:28.460> the<00:02:28.580> game<00:02:28.790> now<00:02:29.330> most<00:02:29.540> of<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.720> time

wolves in the game now most of the time
you'll<00:02:30.080> use<00:02:30.110> this<00:02:30.410> to<00:02:30.560> get<00:02:30.680> around<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.040> jungle

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
you'll use this to get around the jungle

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.100 
you'll use this to get around the jungle
quicker<00:02:31.640> you'll<00:02:32.000> use<00:02:32.150> it<00:02:32.300> on<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:32.510> grump<00:02:32.840> the

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
quicker you'll use it on the grump the

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.840 
quicker you'll use it on the grump the
crog's<00:02:33.410> and<00:02:33.710> buffs<00:02:33.920> for<00:02:34.040> example<00:02:34.520> to<00:02:34.670> either

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
get around to chase people or to escape

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.260 
get around to chase people or to escape
people<00:02:37.520> when<00:02:37.640> you're<00:02:37.760> going<00:02:38.000> through<00:02:38.180> the

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
people when you're going through the

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.210 
people when you're going through the
jungle<00:02:38.510> it's<00:02:39.110> also<00:02:39.290> really<00:02:39.590> useful<00:02:39.710> for

them with your charge instead of

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
charge or a active you have to have

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.510

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
the wall you have to be a little bit

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.190 
the wall you have to be a little bit
careful<00:03:01.610> because<00:03:02.000> if<00:03:02.240> you<00:03:02.390> right-click<00:03:02.660> away

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
careful because if you right-click away

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.480 
careful because if you right-click away
from<00:03:03.440> the<00:03:03.530> wall<00:03:03.710> and<00:03:03.890> you're<00:03:04.010> just<00:03:04.100> gonna<00:03:04.190> Auto

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
from the wall and you're just gonna Auto

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
part and it so you have to click next to

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:07.900 
part and it so you have to click next to
the<00:03:06.920> wall<00:03:07.100> then<00:03:07.370> when<00:03:07.580> you're<00:03:07.730> there

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910

go<00:03:09.980> over<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.280> wall<00:03:10.490> there<00:03:10.970> are<00:03:11.060> also<00:03:11.180> two<00:03:11.510> ways

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
go over the wall there are also two ways

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.940 
go over the wall there are also two ways
you<00:03:11.810> can<00:03:11.900> actually<00:03:12.200> get<00:03:12.410> vision<00:03:12.740> you<00:03:12.830> can

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
you can actually get vision you can

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.530 
you can actually get vision you can
either<00:03:13.130> just<00:03:13.310> ward<00:03:13.670> over<00:03:13.970> which<00:03:14.120> is<00:03:14.270> probably

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
either just ward over which is probably

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.000 
either just ward over which is probably
a<00:03:14.600> little<00:03:14.690> bit<00:03:14.840> quicker<00:03:15.140> or<00:03:15.500> you<00:03:15.590> can<00:03:15.740> use<00:03:15.890> your

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
a little bit quicker or you can use your

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.920 
a little bit quicker or you can use your
W<00:03:16.490> which<00:03:16.670> will<00:03:16.820> get<00:03:16.970> aggro<00:03:17.360> and<00:03:17.660> then<00:03:17.780> you'll

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
W which will get aggro and then you'll

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.450 
W which will get aggro and then you'll
get<00:03:18.050> vision<00:03:18.440> from<00:03:18.620> that<00:03:18.920> and<00:03:19.130> then<00:03:19.220> you<00:03:19.340> can

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:19.460 
get vision from that and then you can

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.070 
get vision from that and then you can
jump<00:03:19.700> over<00:03:19.880> so<00:03:20.510> that's<00:03:20.570> all<00:03:20.810> for<00:03:20.930> this<00:03:21.020> first
