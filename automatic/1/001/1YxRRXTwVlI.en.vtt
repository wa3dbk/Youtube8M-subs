seems to be a hit or miss book with

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.240 
seems to be a hit or miss book with
everyone<00:00:39.270> I've<00:00:39.480> either<00:00:39.840> heard<00:00:40.350> it's<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.950> best

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
everyone I've either heard it's the best

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.700 
everyone I've either heard it's the best
book<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.760> entire<00:00:42.030> world<00:00:42.090> or<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:43.260> was<00:00:43.290> slow

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
book in the entire world or it was slow

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.799 
book in the entire world or it was slow
and<00:00:43.890> boring<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.309> horrible<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:45.059> I'm<00:00:45.329> wondering

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
and boring and horrible so I'm wondering

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.810 
and boring and horrible so I'm wondering
where<00:00:46.260> all<00:00:46.289> stand<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:47.010> think<00:00:47.219> it's<00:00:47.340> pretty<00:00:47.460> neat

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
where all stand I think it's pretty neat

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.209 
where all stand I think it's pretty neat
so<00:00:48.239> far<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.539> don't<00:00:48.960> read<00:00:49.140> adult<00:00:49.559> fiction<00:00:49.800> very

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
so far I don't read adult fiction very

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.700 
so far I don't read adult fiction very
often<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:50.760> it's<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.910> very<00:00:50.940> different<00:00:51.420> pace<00:00:51.960> that

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
often so it's a very different pace that

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.950 
often so it's a very different pace that
I<00:00:52.770> have<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.070> get<00:00:53.219> used<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.579> but<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:54.120> think<00:00:54.480> I'll

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
I have to get used to but I think I'll

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.869 
I have to get used to but I think I'll
like<00:00:55.140> this<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.410> ton<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.800> people<00:00:56.219> are<00:00:56.579> just

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
like this a ton of people are just

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.090 
like this a ton of people are just
raving<00:00:57.270> about<00:00:57.570> this<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.320> I'm<00:00:58.559> hoping<00:00:58.829> I'll<00:00:58.980> be

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
raving about this so I'm hoping I'll be

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.369 
raving about this so I'm hoping I'll be
one<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.370> those<00:00:59.520> that<00:00:59.820> enjoy<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.090> lot<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.809> then

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
one of those that enjoy a lot and then

by<00:01:04.949> aldous<00:01:05.100> huxley<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:06.210> don't<00:01:06.510> know<00:01:06.600> why<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:06.810> just

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
by aldous huxley I don't know why I just

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.690 
by aldous huxley I don't know why I just
made<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.439> face<00:01:07.650> because<00:01:07.920> honestly<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:08.490> far

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
made that face because honestly so far

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.609 
made that face because honestly so far
it's<00:01:08.880> actually<00:01:09.299> pretty<00:01:09.869> neat<00:01:10.170> it's<00:01:10.439> a

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
it's actually pretty neat it's a

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.179 
it's actually pretty neat it's a
dystopian<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:12.030> was<00:01:12.180> written<00:01:12.420> in<00:01:12.830> 1932<00:01:13.830> and

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
dystopian that was written in 1932 and

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.420 
dystopian that was written in 1932 and
it's<00:01:14.369> very<00:01:15.119> accurate<00:01:15.530> for<00:01:16.530> just<00:01:16.740> open<00:01:17.100> written

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
it's very accurate for just open written

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.160 
it's very accurate for just open written
in<00:01:17.520> 1932<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:18.450> that's<00:01:18.630> what<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:18.840> think<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:19.140> really

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
in 1932 so that's what I think is really

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.289 
in 1932 so that's what I think is really
interesting<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.920> creepy<00:01:20.340> about<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.909> have

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299
