conserving paper where you see this you

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.149 
conserving paper where you see this you
just<00:02:18.360> flag<00:02:18.629> the<00:02:18.900> ends<00:02:19.200> of<00:02:19.290> each<00:02:19.409> of<00:02:19.620> those<00:02:19.769> and

just flag the ends of each of those and

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:22.369 
just flag the ends of each of those and
you<00:02:21.030> put<00:02:21.239> those<00:02:21.390> under<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:22.019> little<00:02:22.230> brown

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
to be used for anyway also in the kit is

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.750 
to be used for anyway also in the kit is
this<00:02:51.750> gold<00:02:52.319> shimmer<00:02:52.799> trammell<00:02:53.250> whole<00:02:53.430> roll<00:02:53.730> of

this gold shimmer trammell whole roll of

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.119 
this gold shimmer trammell whole roll of
it<00:02:54.090> which<00:02:54.299> is<00:02:54.480> awesome<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:55.409> you're<00:02:55.950> just

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
it which is awesome and you're just

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:57.770 
it which is awesome and you're just
going<00:02:56.250> to<00:02:56.310> go<00:02:56.430> ahead<00:02:56.549> and<00:02:56.730> flag<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.420> ends<00:02:57.690> of

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
going to go ahead and flag the ends of

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.009 
going to go ahead and flag the ends of
those<00:02:58.370> now<00:02:59.370> i<00:02:59.400> use<00:02:59.670> my<00:02:59.849> tweezer<00:03:00.239> be<00:03:00.389> tweezers

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
those now i use my tweezer be tweezers

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.860 
those now i use my tweezer be tweezers
to<00:03:01.049> pry<00:03:01.560> off<00:03:01.769> the<00:03:02.030> sinclair<00:03:03.030> backing<00:03:03.510> to<00:03:03.689> this

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
to pry off the sinclair backing to this

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.770 
to pry off the sinclair backing to this
because<00:03:04.639> this<00:03:05.639> tweezers<00:03:06.060> have<00:03:06.239> like<00:03:06.389> a<00:03:06.420> sharp

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
because this tweezers have like a sharp

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.229 
because this tweezers have like a sharp
point<00:03:07.019> and<00:03:07.379> that's<00:03:08.220> a<00:03:08.430> way<00:03:08.579> i<00:03:08.609> can<00:03:08.790> get<00:03:09.120> in

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
point and that's a way i can get in

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.629 
point and that's a way i can get in
there<00:03:09.450> and<00:03:09.629> get<00:03:10.470> that<00:03:10.650> pulled<00:03:10.829> off<00:03:11.040> i<00:03:11.280> find<00:03:11.519> it

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:11.639 
there and get that pulled off i find it

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:13.610 
there and get that pulled off i find it
really<00:03:11.670> hard<00:03:12.030> otherwise<00:03:12.450> I'm<00:03:13.290> just<00:03:13.349> gonna

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
really hard otherwise I'm just gonna

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.210 
really hard otherwise I'm just gonna
oops<00:03:14.069> too<00:03:14.340> long<00:03:15.139> it's<00:03:16.139> a<00:03:16.319> surprisingly<00:03:16.799> short

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
oops too long it's a surprisingly short

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.509 
oops too long it's a surprisingly short
amount<00:03:17.760> that<00:03:18.000> you<00:03:18.150> really<00:03:18.480> need<00:03:18.660> right<00:03:18.810> there

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
amount that you really need right there

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.710 
amount that you really need right there
might<00:03:20.519> be<00:03:20.549> half<00:03:20.849> an<00:03:21.000> inch<00:03:21.150> I<00:03:21.299> mean<00:03:21.419> it's<00:03:21.540> really

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
might be half an inch I mean it's really

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.159 
might be half an inch I mean it's really
tiny<00:03:22.169> so<00:03:23.239> the<00:03:24.239> other<00:03:24.480> thing<00:03:24.569> that<00:03:24.810> comes<00:03:25.049> in

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.169 
tiny so the other thing that comes in

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:26.539 
tiny so the other thing that comes in
the<00:03:25.260> kit<00:03:25.379> are<00:03:25.590> these<00:03:25.709> embellishments<00:03:26.099> and

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
the kit are these embellishments and

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.860 
the kit are these embellishments and
they're<00:03:26.699> basically<00:03:27.260> sequence<00:03:28.260> backed<00:03:28.829> with

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
they're basically sequence backed with

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.050 
they're basically sequence backed with
with<00:03:30.870> adhesive<00:03:31.440> and<00:03:31.680> i'm<00:03:32.370> using<00:03:32.669> my<00:03:32.699> tweezer

is<00:03:58.530> better<00:03:58.829> with<00:03:59.069> friends<00:03:59.579> I<00:03:59.760> usually<00:04:00.720> cut

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
is better with friends I usually cut

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.740 
is better with friends I usually cut
that<00:04:01.049> kind<00:04:01.319> of<00:04:01.409> close<00:04:01.590> to<00:04:01.799> the<00:04:01.949> edge<00:04:02.750> obviously

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
that kind of close to the edge obviously

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.300 
that kind of close to the edge obviously
not<00:04:03.900> close<00:04:04.169> enough<00:04:04.470> here<00:04:04.739> so<00:04:04.949> it<00:04:05.040> trimmed<00:04:05.250> a

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
not close enough here so it trimmed a

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.680 
not close enough here so it trimmed a
little<00:04:05.370> bit<00:04:05.639> more<00:04:05.790> but<00:04:06.000> it<00:04:06.090> makes<00:04:06.269> it<00:04:06.389> easier

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
little bit more but it makes it easier

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.149 
little bit more but it makes it easier
to<00:04:06.750> cut<00:04:07.049> when<00:04:07.229> you're<00:04:07.349> close<00:04:07.530> to<00:04:07.560> the<00:04:07.829> edge<00:04:07.949> and

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 
to cut when you're close to the edge and

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:09.890 
to cut when you're close to the edge and
if<00:04:08.340> you<00:04:08.430> do<00:04:08.549> it<00:04:08.669> right<00:04:08.849> you<00:04:09.150> don't<00:04:09.359> have<00:04:09.510> to<00:04:09.750> cut

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
if you do it right you don't have to cut

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.379 
if you do it right you don't have to cut
that<00:04:10.019> edge<00:04:10.229> so<00:04:10.530> I<00:04:10.790> hope<00:04:11.790> you<00:04:11.970> enjoyed<00:04:12.239> this
