when you want why was that because it

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.360 
when you want why was that because it
was<00:00:36.540> just<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.990> be<00:00:37.110> expected<00:00:37.650> and<00:00:37.800> how<00:00:37.920> beating

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
was just to be expected and how beating

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.800 
was just to be expected and how beating
dig<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:38.670> probably<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.030> best<00:00:39.240> feeling<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.630> can

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:39.810 
dig is probably the best feeling I can

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.180 
dig is probably the best feeling I can
get<00:00:39.990> because<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.770> would<00:00:40.890> have<00:00:40.950> been<00:00:41.070> nice<00:00:41.160> to
