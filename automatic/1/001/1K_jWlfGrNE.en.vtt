all right so part one we were trying to
get<00:00:04.440> a<00:00:04.470> good<00:00:04.680> ring<00:00:04.920> in<00:00:05.040> Binion<00:00:05.370> pattern<00:00:05.759> and

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
get a good ring in Binion pattern and

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.179 
get a good ring in Binion pattern and
the<00:00:06.750> camera<00:00:07.259> died<00:00:07.440> right<00:00:07.740> in<00:00:07.859> the<00:00:07.919> middle<00:00:08.099> of

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
the camera died right in the middle of

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.390 
the camera died right in the middle of
the<00:00:08.280> show<00:00:09.139> so<00:00:10.139> I<00:00:10.440> did<00:00:10.980> a<00:00:11.010> little<00:00:11.160> bit<00:00:11.340> of

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
the show so I did a little bit of

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.280 
the show so I did a little bit of
playing<00:00:11.700> with<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.090> pattern<00:00:12.509> and<00:00:12.719> I<00:00:12.870> got<00:00:13.049> it<00:00:13.200> a

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
playing with the pattern and I got it a

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.379 
playing with the pattern and I got it a
lot<00:00:13.410> better<00:00:13.710> but<00:00:14.219> it<00:00:14.370> still<00:00:14.610> was<00:00:14.790> acting<00:00:15.150> funny

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
lot better but it still was acting funny

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.390 
lot better but it still was acting funny
so<00:00:15.809> I<00:00:15.870> want<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.109> show<00:00:16.230> you<00:00:16.289> what<00:00:16.500> I've<00:00:16.619> got<00:00:19.400> if

you look in here it's still a little bit

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.310 
you look in here it's still a little bit
heavy<00:00:24.390> in<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.750> very<00:00:24.990> bottom<00:00:25.820> you<00:00:26.820> got<00:00:26.970> that

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
heavy in the very bottom you got that

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.290 
heavy in the very bottom you got that
all<00:00:28.320> right<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.859> little<00:00:29.220> heavier<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:29.939> I<00:00:29.970> wanted

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
all right a little heavier and I wanted

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.730 
all right a little heavier and I wanted
the<00:00:30.449> very<00:00:30.660> bottom<00:00:31.080> it's<00:00:31.199> spread<00:00:31.529> out<00:00:31.560> pretty

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
the very bottom it's spread out pretty

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.580 
the very bottom it's spread out pretty
good<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.279> so<00:00:32.520> high<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.300> I've<00:00:34.050> moved<00:00:34.410> the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
good and so high and I've moved the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.220 
good and so high and I've moved the
pinion<00:00:35.010> from<00:00:35.370> 15,000<00:00:36.300> deeper<00:00:36.660> than<00:00:36.809> we<00:00:36.930> had<00:00:37.079> it

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
pinion from 15,000 deeper than we had it

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.790 
pinion from 15,000 deeper than we had it
to<00:00:37.350> 15,000<00:00:38.219> shallower<00:00:38.760> than<00:00:38.969> we<00:00:39.149> had<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.800> you

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
to 15,000 shallower than we had it you

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.479 
to 15,000 shallower than we had it you
look<00:00:41.010> at<00:00:41.160> this<00:00:41.640> area<00:00:42.710> this<00:00:43.710> one's<00:00:43.950> pretty<00:00:44.190> good

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
look at this area this one's pretty good

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.060 
look at this area this one's pretty good
nice<00:00:45.360> pattern<00:00:47.300> top<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.510> bottom<00:00:48.660> it's<00:00:49.020> not<00:00:49.320> 2d

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
nice pattern top to bottom it's not 2d

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.479 
nice pattern top to bottom it's not 2d
it's<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.370> little<00:00:50.579> high<00:00:51.140> so<00:00:52.160> I'm<00:00:53.160> going<00:00:53.340> like

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
it's a little high so I'm going like

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.869 
it's a little high so I'm going like
what's<00:00:53.969> what's<00:00:54.510> going<00:00:54.629> on<00:00:55.280> mess<00:00:56.280> up<00:00:56.550> in<00:00:56.730> my

so<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.260> ran<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.590> dial<00:00:59.070> in<00:00:59.280> on<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.329> backside<00:01:00.600> of

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
so I ran a dial in on the backside of

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.910 
so I ran a dial in on the backside of
the<00:01:01.020> ringer<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.530> got<00:01:01.770> 4,000<00:01:03.199> here<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.379> our<00:01:04.559> brand

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
register now that would cause about a

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.580 
register now that would cause about a

thousand sand pinion depth change which

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.440 
thousand sand pinion depth change which
wouldn't<00:01:26.009> be<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.369> end<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.729> world<00:01:26.939> but<00:01:27.240> now

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
wouldn't be the end of the world but now

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:45.410 
wouldn't be the end of the world but now
look<00:01:27.689> at<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:27.930> this<00:01:28.049> way<00:01:29.810> rework<00:01:30.810> this

3000 s clearance with 4000 wobble no not
happen<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:04.240> if<00:02:04.420> you<00:02:04.540> doubt<00:02:04.810> my<00:02:06.600> setup<00:02:07.600> here

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
happen and if you doubt my setup here

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:19.160 
happen and if you doubt my setup here
we'll<00:02:08.920> grab<00:02:09.100> the<00:02:09.280> other<00:02:09.340> gear<00:02:10.800> out<00:02:11.800> of<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:11.950> box

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.100 

so<00:02:20.170> there's<00:02:20.290> our<00:02:20.500> other<00:02:20.680> brand<00:02:20.980> new<00:02:21.190> one<00:02:22.110> put

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
so there's our other brand new one put

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:32.970 
so there's our other brand new one put
that<00:02:23.320> in<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.650> same<00:02:23.920> jig

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.670 

and<00:02:33.489> there<00:02:33.670> is<00:02:33.819> just<00:02:34.120> about<00:02:34.420> zero<00:02:34.810> run<00:02:35.470> out

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
and there is just about zero run out

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.309 
and there is just about zero run out
there<00:02:35.950> maybe<00:02:36.280> 2<00:02:36.640> or<00:02:36.670> 3<00:02:36.819> tenths<00:02:37.390> of<00:02:37.569> a<00:02:37.690> thousands

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
there maybe 2 or 3 tenths of a thousands

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.490 
there maybe 2 or 3 tenths of a thousands
on<00:02:38.470> that<00:02:39.360> carrier<00:02:40.360> and<00:02:40.569> if<00:02:40.840> you<00:02:40.989> check<00:02:41.290> its

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
on that carrier and if you check its

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:50.670 
on that carrier and if you check its
planned<00:02:42.099> run<00:02:42.519> out
