00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.430
 Yuri Aksenov 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.980
 this is the gameplay on the rubric dedicated 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.710
 reviews of games for android put a class under 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.139

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.740
 is a fighting arena on 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.810
 which you will need to fight back 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.310
 from numerous waves of opponents 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.130
 which with each wave will be 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.300
 getting stronger and stronger 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.920
 periodically you will have to fight with 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.140
 sometimes bosses 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.820
 quite interesting abilities 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.320
 control in the game is carried out with 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.320
 using virtual stick 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.600
 and 5 buttons that are responsible for hitting the block 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.969
 capture jump and of course specials 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.399
 opportunity graphically the game look 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.290
 not bad but annoying animation 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.570
 motions apparently the developers did not want 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.430
 make the animation smoother and 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.980
 present in the game 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.410
 pumping system the more you play for 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.780
 a certain hero the more powerful he is 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.460
 it becomes also for the earned details 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.010
 You can buy various upgrades. 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.600
 or unlock new hero 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.149
 the game is distributed in google play 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.760
 absolutely free and in the game completely 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.280
 There are no in-game purchases if 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.740
 you like the game cook about 1 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.810
 gigabytes of free space on the device 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.670
 the second game is called roger racer 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.159
 tracy gyrfest runner whose goal 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.850
 drive as far as possible and don't get into 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.040
 an accident 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.229
 visually the game looks very bright what 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.210
 is definitely a plus of her 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.280
 controls in the game are present 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.189
 two pedals that is you speed 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.630
 can control yourself 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:32.820
 to slow it down 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.960
 you moment to turn 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.070
 you need to use 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.990
 accelerometer 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.360
 either use push in the side 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.340
 parts of the screen for each meter that you 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.860
 manage to overcome you will receive 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.869
 points and for every 100 points you 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.390
 get one coin accumulated coins 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.409
 you can spend on buying others 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.909
 cars 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.369
 Another feature of the game is 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.470
 the presence of pedestrians in it 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.600
 you can shoot down the truth is fun only 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.759
 at first, since for each downed 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.520
 people will be taken from you by 100 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.649
 points and that's for sure you donâ€™t need if you 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.780
 going to make money on another 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.670
 I recommend you to familiarize yourself with the car 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.039
 with this runner next in my 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.380
 the list goes stealth action and gates them 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.780
 the plot we play as a special agent goal like 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.640
 argo neutralize all enemies on location and 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.650
 not to be caught for this we can 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.700
 use different types of weapons 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.890
 also fists 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.050
 if you quietly pick up the enemy from 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.220
 backs you can knock him out 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.840
 single shot 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.970
 control in the game is carried out with 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.550
 using the virtual joystick panel 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.530
 selection of weapons and two buttons corresponding 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.480
 for a shot and a shot there is also a button 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.700
 which allows you to postpone the camera 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.460
 graphically the game looks cute 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.350
 the gameplay of the game is quite monotonous and 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.990
 over time, unfortunately can get bored 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.940
 also straining a long tutorial and 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.220
 to open access the company needs 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.560
 complete at least 6 learning tasks 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.050
 the fourth game is called train runners 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.090
 represents tanais 2d runner itself 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.350
 we have to play glazed which 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.170
 by some strange coincidence 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.600
 circumstances forced to flee at night 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.580
 the roof of the train and avoid the set 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.640
 various obstacles in the form of a conductor 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.440
 flying birds and traffic lights for 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.480
 in order to avoid meeting everyone 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.850
 these barriers we can commit 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.680
 single and double jump to 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.560
 make them enough to do one 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.290
 or two tapas on the screen is very simple 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.750
 but at the same time very difficult next 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.820
 the game is runner too but this time 3 dvd 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.770
 tv line adventure you have to 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.480
 drive a paper airplane 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.730
 control in the game is carried out with 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.800
 using weddings and you can change 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.110
 not only lanes but altitude 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.640
 what makes this game stand out from the other three 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.250
 runners in the game to me 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.980
 Liked the graphics to think of locations and 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.630
 opportunity to choose a map and the main goal 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.760
 flight recently someone in the comments 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.459
 asked me to review on 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.740
 some clicker so that's not caught 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.760
 here one very curious is called he 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.770
 time clickers 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.420
 here we need a gun 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.820
 shoot the blocks that will 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.100
 appear on location first all this 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.230
 will need to be done manually but after we 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.480
 we can make an update that will allow 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.580
 destroy them in the automatic mode 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.280
 You can also upgrade your weapon. 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.470
 made his shots more powerful one 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.090
 the word basic principle of the game coincides with 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.609
 other crackers but it all 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.200
 presented in another cover what if 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.570
 honestly sets him apart 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.910
 penultimate game for today is also time 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.530
 a killer who is called swedes my sweetheart 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.600
 attention to this game attracted 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.580
 unusual gameplay and unusual character 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.980
 for which we have to play 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.830
 we play for a pile of paper which is all 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.990
 forces trying to avoid the fate get 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.180
 under the shredder a stack of paper jumps along 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.490
 moving tape and the only thing we 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.919
 can do it move it from one 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.720
 edges of the treadmill on the other on the way 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:48.450
 we will face various 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.930
 obstacles goal of the game avoid as much as possible 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.090
 more 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.220
 paper shredders pace of the game will be 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.680
 constantly increase as well as periodically 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.840
 will change direction in 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.710
 general play fred mil is very fun and 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.570
 hardcore 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.430
 and completes today's release of the game 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.620
 cutting risks and here we have to 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.030
 fly a rescue helicopter 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.820
 management is carried out using 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:11.130
 Clicking on the left and right side of the screen 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.900
 The main goal of the game is to collect all people and 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.090
 land on a special platform 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.210
 the difficulty is that you can't 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.979
 touch other surfaces 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.580
 Currently, the game has 52 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:22.650
 missions 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.080
 but the developers promise regularly 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.419
 add new ones for completing the mission you 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.340
 You will receive coins that you can 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:31.320
 spend to unlock others 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.180
 the helicopters have come to an end 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.550
