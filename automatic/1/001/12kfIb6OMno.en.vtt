because<00:02:16.190> I'm<00:02:16.489> you<00:02:16.910> know<00:02:17.030> we<00:02:17.870> both<00:02:18.020> had<00:02:18.200> that<00:02:18.320> in

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
because I'm you know we both had that in

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.130 
because I'm you know we both had that in
common<00:02:18.470> so<00:02:19.010> I<00:02:19.340> told<00:02:20.180> him<00:02:20.300> that<00:02:20.390> I<00:02:20.480> had<00:02:20.600> a<00:02:20.840> bike

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
common so I told him that I had a bike

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.850 
common so I told him that I had a bike
but<00:02:21.410> um<00:02:22.420> although<00:02:23.420> he<00:02:23.660> just<00:02:23.840> really<00:02:24.140> didn't

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
but um although he just really didn't

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.650 
but um although he just really didn't
say<00:02:25.010> anything<00:02:25.310> really<00:02:25.459> bad<00:02:25.700> his<00:02:26.239> eyes<00:02:26.450> are

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
say anything really bad his eyes are

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.660 
say anything really bad his eyes are
blinking<00:02:26.810> or<00:02:27.110> whatever<00:02:27.350> so<00:02:28.190> I<00:02:28.250> knew<00:02:28.430> he<00:02:28.580> was

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
blinking or whatever so I knew he was

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.400 
blinking or whatever so I knew he was
still<00:02:28.940> with<00:02:29.090> me<00:02:29.300> but<00:02:29.510> he<00:02:29.690> didn't<00:02:29.959> really<00:02:30.080> say

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
still with me but he didn't really say

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.990 
still with me but he didn't really say
anything<00:02:30.440> back<00:02:30.980> so<00:02:33.970> to<00:02:34.970> tell<00:02:35.120> you<00:02:35.269> through<00:02:35.510> I<00:02:35.780> I

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
anything back so to tell you through I I

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.030 
anything back so to tell you through I I
thought<00:02:38.000> he<00:02:38.120> may<00:02:38.530> he<00:02:39.530> wasn't<00:02:39.769> going<00:02:39.860> to<00:02:39.950> make

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
thought he may he wasn't going to make

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.190 
thought he may he wasn't going to make
it<00:02:40.100> just<00:02:40.790> from<00:02:41.239> the<00:02:41.360> extent<00:02:41.690> of<00:02:41.720> his<00:02:41.810> injuries

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
it just from the extent of his injuries

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:49.360 
it just from the extent of his injuries
that<00:02:42.739> he<00:02:42.830> had<00:02:43.750> going<00:02:44.750> on<00:02:45.110> and<00:02:45.470> uh<00:02:45.700> I<00:02:48.370> literally

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
that he had going on and uh I literally

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.729 
that he had going on and uh I literally
thought<00:02:49.670> he<00:02:50.299> was<00:02:50.420> gonna<00:02:50.630> die<00:02:51.320> right<00:02:51.350> in<00:02:51.650> front

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
thought he was gonna die right in front

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.140 
thought he was gonna die right in front
of<00:02:51.950> me<00:02:52.070> just<00:02:53.560> it<00:02:54.560> was<00:02:54.709> just<00:02:54.760> it<00:02:55.760> was<00:02:55.820> one<00:02:56.030> of<00:02:56.090> the

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
of me just it was just it was one of the

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.890 
of me just it was just it was one of the
worst<00:02:56.239> sights<00:02:56.600> I've<00:02:56.870> ever<00:02:57.079> seen<00:02:58.600> it<00:02:59.600> was<00:02:59.750> just

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
worst sights I've ever seen it was just

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.759 
worst sights I've ever seen it was just
it<00:03:00.470> was<00:03:00.530> just<00:03:00.650> horrible<00:03:01.360> and<00:03:02.440> why<00:03:03.440> do<00:03:03.500> we<00:03:03.680> have

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
it was just horrible and why do we have

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.960 
it was just horrible and why do we have
all<00:03:03.829> these<00:03:04.010> crazy<00:03:04.250> people<00:03:04.670> doing<00:03:04.940> things

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:14.630 

so<00:03:08.970> it<00:03:09.330> was<00:03:09.450> just<00:03:09.750> I<00:03:11.840> just<00:03:12.840> I<00:03:13.590> don't<00:03:13.980> even<00:03:14.310> know

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
so it was just I just I don't even know

so it was just I just I don't even know
how<00:03:14.790> to<00:03:14.820> explain<00:03:14.940> it<00:03:15.390> but<00:03:16.350> um<00:03:16.560> I<00:03:17.010> was<00:03:17.820> probably

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
how to explain it but um I was probably

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.040 
how to explain it but um I was probably
talking<00:03:18.540> to<00:03:18.810> him<00:03:18.960> for<00:03:18.990> maybe<00:03:19.230> like<00:03:19.350> a<00:03:19.470> minute

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050
