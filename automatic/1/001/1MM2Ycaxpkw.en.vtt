sound like this and then the picking

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.319 
sound like this and then the picking
pattern<00:00:34.680> is<00:00:34.890> kind<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.160> like<00:00:35.250> your<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.270> your

we put our pointer finger on 5th fret D

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.709 
we put our pointer finger on 5th fret D
string<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.809> our<00:00:54.809> ring<00:00:55.379> finger<00:00:55.410> on<00:00:56.120> 7th<00:00:57.120> fret<00:00:57.360> g

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:11.040 

the<00:01:03.550> same<00:01:03.760> picking<00:01:03.970> pattern<00:01:09.690> in<00:01:10.690> the<00:01:10.810> third

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
the same picking pattern in the third

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.160 
the same picking pattern in the third

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
chord you slide both fingers down two

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.070 
chord you slide both fingers down two
frets<00:01:14.350> that's<00:01:14.740> it<00:01:14.860> so<00:01:15.370> you<00:01:15.460> have<00:01:15.550> third<00:01:15.850> fret<00:01:16.240> D

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
frets that's it so you have third fret D

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.500 
frets that's it so you have third fret D
string<00:01:17.110> and<00:01:17.590> fifth<00:01:18.460> fret<00:01:18.700> g<00:01:19.300> string<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:22.360> same

last<00:01:31.330> two<00:01:31.600> a<00:01:31.630> little<00:01:31.810> bit<00:01:31.960> faster<00:01:32.410> you<00:01:32.670> go

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
last two a little bit faster you go

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.320 
last two a little bit faster you go
fifth<00:01:34.060> fret<00:01:34.360> B<00:01:34.870> string<00:01:34.900> and<00:01:35.820> third<00:01:36.820> fret<00:01:37.150> a

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
string to see of them GT and then the

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.830 
string to see of them GT and then the
last<00:01:50.410> chord<00:01:50.770> is<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:52.090> G<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:54.310> it's<00:01:54.460> third<00:01:54.729> fret<00:01:55.030> B

so<00:02:03.790> a<00:02:04.150> minor<00:02:04.810> G<00:02:11.190> F<00:02:17.190> G<00:02:20.250> so<00:02:21.250> when<00:02:21.340> you<00:02:21.400> put<00:02:21.520> it<00:02:21.610> all

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
so a minor G F G so when you put it all

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:39.120 
so a minor G F G so when you put it all
together<00:02:21.850> you<00:02:22.120> get<00:02:22.330> this<00:02:37.769> alright<00:02:38.769> number<00:02:39.010> two

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
together you get this alright number two

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.509 
together you get this alright number two
the<00:02:39.250> course<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:41.620> course<00:02:41.860> is<00:02:42.069> actually<00:02:42.370> quite

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
the course the course is actually quite

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.250 
the course the course is actually quite
a<00:02:42.580> bit<00:02:42.730> easier<00:02:42.850> than<00:02:43.150> that<00:02:43.330> then<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:43.840> verse<00:02:43.989> is

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
a bit easier than that then the verse is

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.890 
a bit easier than that then the verse is
so<00:02:45.160> we<00:02:45.280> start<00:02:45.489> with<00:02:45.610> a<00:02:45.640> basic<00:02:45.850> F<00:02:46.180> power<00:02:46.540> chord

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
so we start with a basic F power chord

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.280 
so we start with a basic F power chord
first<00:02:47.830> fret<00:02:48.130> E<00:02:48.280> string<00:02:48.310> hmm<00:02:49.150> and<00:02:49.480> then<00:02:49.989> third

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
first fret E string hmm and then third

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.470 
first fret E string hmm and then third
fret<00:02:50.590> for<00:02:50.830> your<00:02:50.860> a<00:02:51.130> and<00:02:51.670> your<00:02:51.910> D<00:02:52.030> string

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
fret for your a and your D string

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.430 
fret for your a and your D string
it<00:02:53.050> should<00:02:53.200> sound<00:02:53.290> like<00:02:53.380> this<00:02:55.140> just<00:02:56.140> standard

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
it should sound like this just standard

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.509 
it should sound like this just standard
tuning<00:02:56.620> by<00:02:56.860> the<00:02:56.980> way<00:02:57.069> I<00:02:57.100> forgot<00:02:57.220> to<00:02:57.370> mention

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
tuning by the way I forgot to mention

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:03.120 
tuning by the way I forgot to mention
that<00:02:57.700> earlier<00:03:00.900> so<00:03:01.900> your<00:03:02.019> course<00:03:02.260> starts<00:03:02.620> and

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
that earlier so your course starts and

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.940 
that earlier so your course starts and
you<00:03:03.220> hit<00:03:03.400> one<00:03:03.850> two<00:03:04.060> three<00:03:04.299> four

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.800 

then<00:03:08.950> you<00:03:09.130> go<00:03:09.190> up<00:03:09.280> to<00:03:09.400> an<00:03:09.489> a<00:03:09.640> fifth<00:03:10.329> fret<00:03:10.600> a

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
then you go up to an a fifth fret a

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.180 
then you go up to an a fifth fret a
string<00:03:10.860> seventh<00:03:11.860> fret<00:03:11.920> a<00:03:12.340> and<00:03:13.030> D<00:03:13.150> strings<00:03:14.190> and

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
string seventh fret a and D strings and

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.920 
string seventh fret a and D strings and
I<00:03:15.310> like<00:03:15.459> to<00:03:15.610> bar<00:03:15.850> this<00:03:16.030> one<00:03:16.209> it's<00:03:16.360> not<00:03:16.510> actually

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
I like to bar this one it's not actually

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.360 
I like to bar this one it's not actually
in<00:03:17.019> the<00:03:17.049> recorded<00:03:17.560> version<00:03:17.829> of<00:03:17.860> the<00:03:17.950> song<00:03:18.160> he

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
in the recorded version of the song he

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.000 
in the recorded version of the song he
plays<00:03:18.549> it<00:03:18.700> like<00:03:18.730> this<00:03:18.940> live<00:03:19.209> but<00:03:20.049> you<00:03:20.170> bar<00:03:20.530> your

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
plays it like this live but you bar your

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.330 
plays it like this live but you bar your
fifth<00:03:21.250> fret<00:03:21.489> here<00:03:21.730> with<00:03:22.030> your<00:03:22.209> pointer<00:03:23.019> finger

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
fifth fret here with your pointer finger

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.069 
fifth fret here with your pointer finger
so<00:03:24.340> what<00:03:24.489> you<00:03:24.579> really<00:03:24.670> get<00:03:24.940> is<00:03:25.180> fifth<00:03:25.570> fret<00:03:25.840> a

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
so what you really get is fifth fret a

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.130 
so what you really get is fifth fret a
