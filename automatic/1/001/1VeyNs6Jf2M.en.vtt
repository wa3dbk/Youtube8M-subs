if<00:03:29.250> you'd<00:03:29.459> like<00:03:29.609> to<00:03:29.790> add<00:03:29.910> a<00:03:29.940> little<00:03:30.329> bit<00:03:30.600> of

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
if you'd like to add a little bit of

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.000 
if you'd like to add a little bit of
flavor<00:03:31.940> to<00:03:32.940> your<00:03:32.970> chocolate<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:33.930> then<00:03:34.680> I'm

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
flavor to your chocolate and then I'm

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.620 
flavor to your chocolate and then I'm
just<00:03:35.100> going<00:03:35.280> to<00:03:35.370> put<00:03:35.519> that<00:03:35.700> on<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:36.000> saucepan

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
just going to put that on the saucepan

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:43.879 
just going to put that on the saucepan
and<00:03:36.870> let<00:03:36.959> it<00:03:37.829> melt<00:03:41.420> okay<00:03:42.420> so<00:03:42.480> our<00:03:43.260> chocolate<00:03:43.769> is

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
and let it melt okay so our chocolate is

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:47.379 
and let it melt okay so our chocolate is
now<00:03:44.130> melted<00:03:44.670> so<00:03:44.970> just<00:03:45.180> take<00:03:45.359> it<00:03:45.389> off<00:03:45.660> the<00:03:45.900> heat

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389 
now melted so just take it off the heat

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:50.900 
now melted so just take it off the heat
the<00:03:48.389> reason<00:03:48.840> we<00:03:48.989> added<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.739> oil<00:03:49.769> is<00:03:50.400> because

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
the reason we added the oil is because

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.210 
the reason we added the oil is because
when<00:03:51.120> we<00:03:51.239> dip<00:03:51.480> our<00:03:51.690> bananas<00:03:52.319> when<00:03:52.650> you<00:03:52.769> put<00:03:52.950> oil

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
when we dip our bananas when you put oil

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.390 
when we dip our bananas when you put oil
into<00:03:53.639> chocolate<00:03:54.329> it<00:03:55.200> kind<00:03:55.530> of<00:03:55.620> thins<00:03:55.980> it<00:03:56.250> out

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
into chocolate it kind of thins it out

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.879 
into chocolate it kind of thins it out
because<00:03:57.030> what<00:03:57.180> we<00:03:57.299> want<00:03:57.540> is<00:03:57.690> a<00:03:57.750> thin<00:03:58.319> coating

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:58.889 
because what we want is a thin coating

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:01.670 
because what we want is a thin coating
of<00:03:59.010> chocolate<00:03:59.639> on<00:03:59.850> our<00:04:00.600> bananas<00:04:01.200> and<00:04:01.440> if<00:04:01.560> we

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
of chocolate on our bananas and if we

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.640 
of chocolate on our bananas and if we
didn't<00:04:01.950> put<00:04:02.130> that<00:04:02.280> oil<00:04:02.549> then<00:04:03.299> it<00:04:03.630> tends<00:04:04.079> to<00:04:04.260> we

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
didn't put that oil then it tends to we

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.309 
didn't put that oil then it tends to we
get<00:04:04.859> too<00:04:05.100> thick<00:04:05.370> of<00:04:05.519> a<00:04:05.609> coat<00:04:05.850> so<00:04:06.209> that's<00:04:07.049> the

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
get too thick of a coat so that's the

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:08.960 
get too thick of a coat so that's the
reason<00:04:07.530> now<00:04:08.190> I'm<00:04:08.340> just<00:04:08.519> going<00:04:08.639> to<00:04:08.700> let<00:04:08.819> that

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
reason now I'm just going to let that

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.530 
reason now I'm just going to let that
cool<00:04:09.209> a<00:04:09.269> little<00:04:10.459> to<00:04:11.459> room<00:04:11.730> temperatures<00:04:12.359> we

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
cool a little to room temperatures we

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.690 
cool a little to room temperatures we
don't<00:04:12.720> want<00:04:12.840> it<00:04:12.930> hot<00:04:13.200> and<00:04:13.530> then<00:04:14.040> have<00:04:14.340> ready

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
don't want it hot and then have ready

side dip them all I'll put them back in
the<00:05:22.469> freezer<00:05:22.680> I<00:05:22.979> mean<00:05:23.639> you<00:05:23.729> could<00:05:24.060> eat<00:05:24.240> them

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
the freezer I mean you could eat them

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.939 
the freezer I mean you could eat them
right<00:05:24.509> away<00:05:24.569> but<00:05:24.780> the<00:05:24.960> problem<00:05:25.289> is<00:05:25.440> we<00:05:25.650> didn't

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:25.949 
right away but the problem is we didn't

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:28.339 
right away but the problem is we didn't
freeze<00:05:26.550> our<00:05:26.819> bananas<00:05:27.300> all<00:05:27.509> the<00:05:27.719> way<00:05:27.870> through

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:28.349 
freeze our bananas all the way through

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:32.719 
freeze our bananas all the way through
and<00:05:29.930> so<00:05:30.930> they're<00:05:31.080> still<00:05:31.289> kind<00:05:31.500> of<00:05:31.560> soft<00:05:31.830> so<00:05:32.639> you

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729 
and so they're still kind of soft so you

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:34.339 
and so they're still kind of soft so you
want<00:05:32.969> to<00:05:33.030> put<00:05:33.150> it<00:05:33.240> back<00:05:33.389> in<00:05:33.599> the<00:05:33.719> freezer<00:05:34.169> for

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:34.349 
want to put it back in the freezer for

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:36.529 
want to put it back in the freezer for
maybe<00:05:34.740> at<00:05:34.860> least<00:05:35.039> an<00:05:35.310> hour<00:05:35.490> before<00:05:35.699> serving

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539 
maybe at least an hour before serving

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:39.320 
maybe at least an hour before serving
now<00:05:37.080> you<00:05:37.710> already<00:05:38.250> see<00:05:38.580> it's<00:05:38.699> starting<00:05:39.180> to

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
now you already see it's starting to

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.779 
now you already see it's starting to
harden<00:05:39.539> and<00:05:39.930> if<00:05:40.800> you<00:05:40.979> want<00:05:41.280> you<00:05:41.610> could
