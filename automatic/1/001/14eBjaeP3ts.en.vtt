00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:14.500
 Hello everyone, Vika and you and 2 guide 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:17.170
 on rf before 1 you see the parcels start with 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.600
 the fact that now they all assert that 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.450
 frs before imbalance his character 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.160
 you must either remove either hard excel and I 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.020
 I look agree and I am sure of one hundred 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.100
 percent that soon his poppixie 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:32.140
 and strongly enough let's move on to 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.969
 the guide itself namely the combine com 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.319
 who can do with land and 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:38.589
 and other characters 

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:40.120
 very often happens when the opponent 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:43.929
 blocking your escape route 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.469
 coming up from the side can solve this problem 

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:46.510
 easy 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:47.469
 during startup or prior to use 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.229
 rolling boulder 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:52.710
 we push the enemy away 

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:55.389
 it turns out such a garbage 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.260
 we will go further the enemy takes damage 

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:58.629
 and goes back 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.879
 the way is free in we fly forward the truth 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:07.119
 does not work if you block the road 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:08.280
 more than that character in such a situation 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:13.500
 when there is no camp 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.920
 urgent need to kurt an opponent but you 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.700
 you roll to it 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.859
 miss what is the solution and 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.960
 here is just rolling time when we 

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:25.630
 roll yourself an opponent need to have time 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.420
 learn from mouth or boulder smash but also with 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.100
 distance is minimal in and so 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.109
 situation when you ganga and teles yes and 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.179
 any character that is somewhere like 

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:36.609
 mate you need to charge sharply and 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:37.210
 do not have much damage 

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:39.460
 great way 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.289
 time between each other stone 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.939
 sit at a great distance and during 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.100
 rolling called clicking on the stone 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:47.799
 builders between you roll along with the stone 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.799
 that is, you and accelerate and stone ad 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:54.549
 opponent smeshariki builder if they 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:56.950
 overshoot creates fat damage him fat 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:57.940
 you fly slow you can still camp 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:03.070
 finish off 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:05.710
 and the loss of the speediest corpse of land as well 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.510
 well worth mid and because he 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.150
 too many farms but because he 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.050
 can annoy her very much 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.270
 rival 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.700
 namely mortar and put foros blood 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.810
 is a rival careless suited to 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.580
 the product is close then we make the frame 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.670
 Agate creep to the husbands creep like a boulder 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.670
 smash and right under the goods and pass them 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.930
 most likely dead and if not measures then by 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.670
 at least pretty crippled it 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.190
 in-game situation is inexpensive yes 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.940
 it really works you believe everything 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:43.030
 made on me 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:43.450
 and if you saw the enemy lands and on 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.940
 midu 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.460
 better way to neutralize it 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:54.850
 gank like this 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:57.150
 did you know that with rolling 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.250
 boulder can escape from the killer girl then 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:03.550
 Now you know for sure 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.200
 save by using where the magnetic ride were 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:09.220
 pole dance dream to fall exactly the table is not 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:12.820
 shoot hurt another situational 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:16.090
 guide often if you line up online and you 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:19.270
 stand behind the river there may come 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:22.120
 enemy mider or you turned to 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:24.250
 nger can easily go without fast run to 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.090
 shop and across the river through 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.550
 impassable crap 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.690
 we roll maybe stuck in 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.690
 the forest but it's better than dying 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.600
 I was often killed, or rather almost 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.640
 always when I first pressed rollin 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:42.360
 bolt in the direction of the enemy crowd 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.340
 but there is a cure for this error 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.630
 time rollers you can character 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.740
 unfold inside you helped and 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.450
 naturally you can knit force staff 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:55.050
 and you fly back if you do 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:04:00.810
 correctly very useful fresh tommy 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:04.650
 Moravian smear a little garbage which 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:09.600
 soon as it is fixed a relationship 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:12.500
 baltur rouling and camp if you go somewhere 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:16.350
 trying to roll and give you a camp 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:19.470
 from in front of you at an acceptable distance 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.480
 have an opponent that does not matter is there are not 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.080
 will be left behind and will be behind him 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:28.080
 but only if you are there, will you 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.669
 stunned if not then what became normal 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.450
 will work fine if before 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:35.669
 land and there is no opponent that's such garbage 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:39.930
 but even fixed so soon over 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:42.150
 will not work as well as lands and 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.120
 good country jump slarke 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:48.510
 all tight you well if Kontrov 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:51.479
 boulder smash pushing their geologist 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.930
 now pulls its but the rolling 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:55.380
 boulder 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.660
 in general, the cat finally, how to counter and 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.330
 Persian before and everything just never 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.440
 walking in a straight line will and pooja puka if 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.510
 you see an enemy pike 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.570
 of speed and then remove more mills 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.669
 more fat characters and more fat well 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.760
 shorter than something more something less but 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:13.800
 the main thing is to be less than and put on 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.919
 wards card otherwise in the initial take it 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.260
 you just fucking 7 azamat and 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:21.000
 there is, and all go step VKontakte group
