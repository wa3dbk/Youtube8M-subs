garden<00:00:03.990> warfare<00:00:04.319> video<00:00:04.980> today<00:00:05.609> I'm<00:00:05.850> on<00:00:06.150> the

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
garden warfare video today I'm on the

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.089 
garden warfare video today I'm on the
brand<00:00:06.480> new<00:00:06.569> map<00:00:06.899> dual<00:00:07.290> Junction<00:00:07.770> because<00:00:07.980> I

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
brand new map dual Junction because I

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.740 
brand new map dual Junction because I
want<00:00:08.250> to<00:00:08.280> talk<00:00:08.460> about<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.880> couple<00:00:09.360> of<00:00:09.510> things

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
want to talk about a couple of things

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.720 
want to talk about a couple of things
that<00:00:09.870> one<00:00:10.139> is<00:00:10.320> two<00:00:10.830> of<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:10.980> maps<00:00:11.190> I<00:00:11.400> believe

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
that one is two of the maps I believe

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.810 
that one is two of the maps I believe
are<00:00:11.940> linked<00:00:12.420> together<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:13.049> also<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.009> character

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
are linked together and also a character

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.580 
are linked together and also a character
so<00:00:15.179> if<00:00:15.269> we<00:00:15.389> take<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.570> look<00:00:15.780> here<00:00:16.049> you<00:00:16.470> actually

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
so if we take a look here you actually

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.300 
so if we take a look here you actually
see<00:00:16.830> there<00:00:17.250> is<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.690> chalk<00:00:18.690> drawing<00:00:19.230> or<00:00:19.439> caveman

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
see there is a chalk drawing or caveman

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.880 
see there is a chalk drawing or caveman
drawing<00:00:20.699> of<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:21.449> Chomper<00:00:22.020> now<00:00:22.470> you<00:00:22.529> can<00:00:22.710> see

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
drawing of a Chomper now you can see

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.439 
drawing of a Chomper now you can see
there<00:00:23.100> because<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.519> spikes<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.119> it's

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
there because of the spikes and it's

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.960 
there because of the spikes and it's
also<00:00:24.630> got<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:24.960> tiny<00:00:25.260> little<00:00:25.470> mini<00:00:25.970> Chomper

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
also got the tiny little mini Chomper

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.070 
also got the tiny little mini Chomper
things<00:00:27.570> as<00:00:27.750> well

things as well
I'm<00:00:28.830> not<00:00:29.010> even<00:00:29.220> sure<00:00:29.369> what<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.550> cobble<00:00:29.849> and

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
I'm not even sure what the cobble and

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.099 
I'm not even sure what the cobble and
that<00:00:30.060> makes<00:00:30.210> just<00:00:30.390> chompers<00:00:30.720> what<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:30.960> have

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
that makes just chompers what you have

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.170 
that makes just chompers what you have
as<00:00:31.289> an<00:00:31.410> accessory<00:00:31.830> on<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.160> game<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.700> if<00:00:33.059> you

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
as an accessory on the game and if you

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.490 
as an accessory on the game and if you
take<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.360> look<00:00:33.540> just<00:00:33.719> below<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.200> actually

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
take a look just below it you actually

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.520 
take a look just below it you actually
see<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.829> skeleton<00:00:35.430> bone<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.719> Chomper<00:00:37.079> soros

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
see a skeleton bone of the Chomper soros

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.049 
see a skeleton bone of the Chomper soros
the<00:00:37.770> satchel<00:00:38.160> called<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.399> chomp<00:00:38.610> asaurus<00:00:39.030> rex

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
the satchel called the chomp asaurus rex

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.209 
the satchel called the chomp asaurus rex
i<00:00:39.540> will<00:00:39.840> actually<00:00:40.079> get<00:00:40.230> into<00:00:40.440> why<00:00:40.829> it's<00:00:41.040> called

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
i will actually get into why it's called

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.920 
i will actually get into why it's called
that<00:00:41.399> in<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.820> second<00:00:42.239> as<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.420> can<00:00:42.570> see<00:00:42.690> there's

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
that in a second as you can see there's

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.410 
that in a second as you can see there's
the<00:00:43.079> tail<00:00:43.320> here's<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.160> legs<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.700> backbone

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
the tail here's the legs the backbone

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.150 
the tail here's the legs the backbone
there's<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.899> head<00:00:46.079> with<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.469> spikes<00:00:46.829> on<00:00:47.039> it

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
there's the head with the spikes on it

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.770 
there's the head with the spikes on it
so<00:00:47.280> we<00:00:47.370> have<00:00:47.550> here<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:48.000> chomp<00:00:48.329> asaurus<00:00:48.750> rex

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
so we have here a chomp asaurus rex

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.720 
so we have here a chomp asaurus rex
there's<00:00:49.530> another<00:00:49.710> one<00:00:49.890> there<00:00:50.100> there's<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.700> few

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
there's another one there there's a few

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.119 
there's another one there there's a few
more<00:00:51.059> dotted<00:00:51.510> around<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:52.110> map<00:00:52.350> as<00:00:52.530> well<00:00:52.890> and

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
more dotted around the map as well and

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.670 
more dotted around the map as well and
if<00:00:53.579> i<00:00:53.670> just<00:00:53.699> come<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.270> here<00:00:54.539> as<00:00:54.899> well<00:00:55.170> there<00:00:55.620> is

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
if i just come in here as well there is

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.660 
if i just come in here as well there is
actually<00:00:56.100> another<00:00:57.289> another<00:00:58.289> one<00:00:58.710> on<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.489> roof

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
actually another another one on the roof

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.400 
actually another another one on the roof
just<00:00:59.879> there<00:01:00.180> there's<00:01:00.480> another<00:01:00.690> chomp<00:01:00.960> asaurus

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
just there there's another chomp asaurus

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.889 
just there there's another chomp asaurus
rex<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.980> it's<00:01:02.460> got<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.699> two<00:01:02.820> spikes<00:01:03.120> there<00:01:03.449> so

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
rex and it's got the two spikes there so

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.719 
rex and it's got the two spikes there so
the<00:01:03.989> reason<00:01:04.379> why<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:04.650> believe<00:01:05.129> this<00:01:05.280> is<00:01:05.430> linked

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
the reason why I believe this is linked

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.580 
the reason why I believe this is linked
into<00:01:05.909> another<00:01:06.299> map<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.780> because<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.439> can

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
into another map is because you can

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.289 
into another map is because you can
actually<00:01:07.650> find<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.130> Champa<00:01:08.460> SAR<00:01:08.670> as<00:01:08.820> Rex<00:01:09.060> on

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
actually find the Champa SAR as Rex on

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.060 
actually find the Champa SAR as Rex on
the<00:01:09.720> new<00:01:09.869> on<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.200> older<00:01:10.650> map<00:01:10.799> on<00:01:10.920> there's

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
the new on the older map on there's

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.090 
the new on the older map on there's
almost<00:01:11.189> down<00:01:12.110> zombies<00:01:13.110> down<00:01:13.290> map<00:01:13.590> cactus

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
almost down zombies down map cactus

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.130 
almost down zombies down map cactus
Canyon<00:01:14.369> so<00:01:14.909> if<00:01:15.000> we're<00:01:15.420> gonna<00:01:15.509> take<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.900> look

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
Canyon so if we're gonna take a look

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.990 
Canyon so if we're gonna take a look
over<00:01:16.409> there<00:01:16.860> I'm<00:01:17.159> gonna<00:01:17.340> find<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:17.790> earth

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
over there I'm gonna find this earth

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.090 
over there I'm gonna find this earth

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
on cactus Canyon so we are now on the

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.620 
on cactus Canyon so we are now on the
map<00:01:32.220> cactus<00:01:32.640> Canyon<00:01:32.880> if<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.270> take<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.450> look

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
map cactus Canyon if you take a look

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.840 
map cactus Canyon if you take a look
just<00:01:33.750> behind<00:01:34.020> me<00:01:34.200> here<00:01:34.229> we<00:01:34.890> have<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.430> Champa

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
just behind me here we have the Champa

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.880 
just behind me here we have the Champa
Saurus<00:01:36.150> Rex<00:01:36.479> skeleton<00:01:36.990> I'm<00:01:37.409> not<00:01:37.560> sure<00:01:37.710> if<00:01:37.770> this

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
Saurus Rex skeleton I'm not sure if this

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.520 
Saurus Rex skeleton I'm not sure if this
one<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.250> exactly<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.970> same<00:01:39.210> but<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:40.140> kind<00:01:40.439> of

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
one is exactly the same but it kind of

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.130 
one is exactly the same but it kind of
indicates<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.159> these<00:01:41.340> this<00:01:42.210> map<00:01:42.509> is<00:01:42.750> there

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
indicates that these this map is there

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.350 
indicates that these this map is there
in<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.409> same<00:01:43.649> kind<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.070> area<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.640> also<00:01:45.030> if<00:01:45.270> you

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
in the same kind of area and also if you

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.510 
in the same kind of area and also if you
take<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.540> look<00:01:45.720> at<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.960> rocky<00:01:46.170> biome<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:47.220> could

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
take a look at the rocky biome it could

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.249 
take a look at the rocky biome it could
be<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.729> same<00:01:47.939> area<00:01:48.360> so<00:01:48.570> these<00:01:48.840> could<00:01:49.170> be

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
be the same area so these could be

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.139 
be the same area so these could be
linked<00:01:49.470> together<00:01:49.649> cactus<00:01:50.220> Canyon<00:01:50.490> could<00:01:51.030> be

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
linked together cactus Canyon could be

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.090 
linked together cactus Canyon could be
linked<00:01:51.390> with<00:01:51.450> jewel<00:01:51.810> Junction<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.740> could<00:01:52.950> be

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
linked with jewel Junction it could be

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.770 
linked with jewel Junction it could be
that<00:01:53.220> when<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.520> zombies<00:01:53.880> dropped<00:01:54.180> down<00:01:54.390> here

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
that when the zombies dropped down here

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.830 
that when the zombies dropped down here
they<00:01:55.409> overtook<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.340> map<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.729> actually<00:01:57.600> made

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
they overtook the map and actually made

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.719 
they overtook the map and actually made
it<00:01:57.869> their<00:01:58.200> own<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.799> made<00:01:59.100> into<00:01:59.430> their<00:01:59.579> own

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
it their own and made into their own

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.580 
it their own and made into their own
mine<00:02:00.000> or<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.810> could<00:02:00.960> be<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.170> other<00:02:01.200> way<00:02:01.560> around

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
mine or it could be the other way around

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.039 
mine or it could be the other way around
were<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.399> zombies<00:02:02.790> used<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.360> own<00:02:03.509> this<00:02:03.780> and

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
were the zombies used to own this and

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.569 
were the zombies used to own this and
then<00:02:04.409> they've<00:02:04.530> come<00:02:04.710> back<00:02:04.860> down<00:02:05.040> for<00:02:05.070> more

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
then they've come back down for more

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.789 
then they've come back down for more
support<00:02:06.000> but<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.570> plants<00:02:06.840> have<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.320> go<00:02:07.560> over

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
support but the plants have to go over

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.650 
support but the plants have to go over
so<00:02:08.369> they<00:02:08.580> are<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.940> two<00:02:09.090> maps<00:02:09.270> linked<00:02:09.509> together

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
so they are the two maps linked together

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.480 
so they are the two maps linked together
as<00:02:10.200> you

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
as you

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.350 
as you
let<00:02:10.850> me<00:02:10.910> just<00:02:11.030> kill<00:02:11.180> this<00:02:11.270> see<00:02:12.140> get<00:02:12.530> this<00:02:12.590> guy

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
let me just kill this see get this guy

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.250 
let me just kill this see get this guy
there<00:02:14.360> we<00:02:14.420> go<00:02:14.510> so<00:02:14.660> we<00:02:14.750> get<00:02:14.840> this<00:02:14.900> guy<00:02:14.990> on

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
there we go so we get this guy on

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.860 
there we go so we get this guy on
there's<00:02:15.530> an<00:02:15.620> engineer<00:02:15.950> as<00:02:16.040> well<00:02:16.360> let<00:02:17.360> me<00:02:17.510> do<00:02:17.630> my

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
there's an engineer as well let me do my

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.620 
there's an engineer as well let me do my
commentary<00:02:18.430> there<00:02:19.430> we<00:02:19.490> go<00:02:19.640> so<00:02:19.970> we<00:02:20.330> have<00:02:20.360> the

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
commentary there we go so we have the

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.060 
commentary there we go so we have the
chopper<00:02:20.870> source<00:02:21.140> here<00:02:21.410> we<00:02:21.620> also<00:02:21.770> had<00:02:22.040> one

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
chopper source here we also had one

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.760 
chopper source here we also had one
injeel'<00:02:22.490> junction<00:02:22.940> so<00:02:23.390> these<00:02:23.870> two<00:02:24.230> seem<00:02:24.620> like

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
injeel' junction so these two seem like

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.920 
injeel' junction so these two seem like
they<00:02:24.890> are<00:02:25.010> linked<00:02:25.220> together<00:02:25.430> in<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.600> actual

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
they are linked together in the actual

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.350 
they are linked together in the actual
game<00:02:27.140> so<00:02:27.710> we<00:02:27.980> might<00:02:28.160> see<00:02:28.430> more<00:02:28.760> and<00:02:29.090> there's<00:02:29.300> a

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
game so we might see more and there's a

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.240 
game so we might see more and there's a
zombie<00:02:29.660> right<00:02:29.810> behind<00:02:30.080> me<00:02:30.260> and<00:02:30.440> you<00:02:30.830> had

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250

terrible<00:02:31.640> aim<00:02:31.820> then<00:02:32.030> but<00:02:32.150> you<00:02:32.240> still<00:02:32.390> got<00:02:32.540> me

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
terrible aim then but you still got me

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.510

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
zombie which actually links into this

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.850 
zombie which actually links into this
because<00:02:38.330> I<00:02:38.390> think<00:02:38.450> it's<00:02:38.690> pretty<00:02:38.750> cool<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:39.410> it
