than in the Aussie outback after all
this<00:00:43.480> is<00:00:43.690> the<00:00:43.839> country<00:00:44.320> that<00:00:44.350> invented<00:00:44.649> the

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
this is the country that invented the

this is the country that invented the
you<00:00:45.690> farmers<00:00:46.690> and<00:00:46.870> tradesmen<00:00:47.140> have<00:00:47.409> been

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
you farmers and tradesmen have been

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.110 
you farmers and tradesmen have been
using<00:00:47.979> the<00:00:48.070> youth<00:00:48.280> as<00:00:48.430> a<00:00:48.489> tool<00:00:48.879> of<00:00:48.909> the<00:00:49.030> trade

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
using the youth as a tool of the trade

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.219 
using the youth as a tool of the trade
for<00:00:49.570> over<00:00:49.930> 70<00:00:50.620> years<00:00:51.420> but<00:00:52.420> the<00:00:52.510> thing<00:00:52.539> is<00:00:52.750> I

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:53.229 
for over 70 years but the thing is I

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:55.529 
for over 70 years but the thing is I
don't<00:00:53.949> reckon<00:00:54.250> Holden's<00:00:54.640> got<00:00:54.699> the<00:00:55.059> tradesmen

00:00:55.529 --> 00:00:55.539 
don't reckon Holden's got the tradesmen

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:59.910 
don't reckon Holden's got the tradesmen
in<00:00:55.629> mind<00:00:55.869> with<00:00:56.110> this<00:00:56.229> generation<00:00:58.589> so<00:00:59.589> this<00:00:59.769> is

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
in mind with this generation so this is

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.920 
in mind with this generation so this is
the<00:01:00.039> SSV<00:01:00.399> model<00:01:00.940> it's<00:01:01.059> the<00:01:01.180> top<00:01:01.420> of<00:01:01.570> the<00:01:01.659> range

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
the SSV model it's the top of the range

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.529 
the SSV model it's the top of the range
which<00:01:02.109> means<00:01:02.530> you<00:01:03.219> get<00:01:03.430> a<00:01:03.640> six<00:01:04.000> litre<00:01:04.239> v8

00:01:04.529 --> 00:01:04.539 
which means you get a six litre v8

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:06.120 
which means you get a six litre v8
engine<00:01:05.019> hooked<00:01:05.199> up<00:01:05.350> to<00:01:05.500> a<00:01:05.530> six-speed

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
engine hooked up to a six-speed

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.880 
engine hooked up to a six-speed
automatic<00:01:07.000> transmission<00:01:07.030> in<00:01:07.750> this<00:01:07.869> case<00:01:08.140> you

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
automatic transmission in this case you

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.190 
automatic transmission in this case you
get<00:01:09.009> the<00:01:09.190> 19<00:01:09.759> inch<00:01:10.000> performance<00:01:10.600> alloy<00:01:10.899> wheels

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
get the 19 inch performance alloy wheels

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.160 
get the 19 inch performance alloy wheels
and<00:01:11.440> the<00:01:12.130> Bridgestone<00:01:12.460> rubber<00:01:13.000> very<00:01:13.539> good<00:01:13.780> now

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
and the Bridgestone rubber very good now

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.719 
and the Bridgestone rubber very good now
the<00:01:14.229> biggest<00:01:14.649> change<00:01:14.979> to<00:01:15.250> the<00:01:15.340> youth<00:01:15.520> this

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
the biggest change to the youth this

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.460 
the biggest change to the youth this
time<00:01:15.940> around<00:01:16.210> apart<00:01:16.810> from<00:01:16.929> the<00:01:17.050> cabin<00:01:17.380> which

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
time around apart from the cabin which

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.520 
time around apart from the cabin which
I'll<00:01:17.619> get<00:01:17.770> to<00:01:17.830> in<00:01:17.979> a<00:01:18.130> sec<00:01:18.369> is<00:01:18.550> the<00:01:19.210> tray<00:01:19.509> a<00:01:19.840> lot

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
I'll get to in a sec is the tray a lot

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.219 
I'll get to in a sec is the tray a lot
of<00:01:20.679> differences<00:01:21.190> first<00:01:21.819> off<00:01:22.149> it's<00:01:22.750> deeper

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
of differences first off it's deeper

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:24.450 
of differences first off it's deeper
than<00:01:23.409> it<00:01:23.440> was<00:01:23.710> before

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
than it was before

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.029 
than it was before
gives<00:01:24.850> you<00:01:24.970> more<00:01:25.000> cubic<00:01:25.509> capacity<00:01:25.860> but<00:01:26.860> the

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:27.039 
gives you more cubic capacity but the

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:29.399 
gives you more cubic capacity but the
change<00:01:27.369> is<00:01:27.580> here<00:01:27.819> where<00:01:28.600> the<00:01:28.630> old<00:01:28.899> one<00:01:29.140> used<00:01:29.289> to

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
change is here where the old one used to

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.440 
change is here where the old one used to
come<00:01:29.679> down<00:01:29.709> and<00:01:30.039> a<00:01:30.100> bit<00:01:30.220> of<00:01:30.310> an<00:01:30.399> angle<00:01:30.729> this<00:01:31.240> one

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
come down and a bit of an angle this one

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.149 
come down and a bit of an angle this one
goes<00:01:31.630> straight<00:01:31.959> down<00:01:32.020> so<00:01:32.470> you<00:01:32.530> lose<00:01:32.770> a<00:01:32.799> bit<00:01:33.009> of

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
goes straight down so you lose a bit of

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.699 
goes straight down so you lose a bit of
that<00:01:33.220> space<00:01:33.549> at<00:01:33.759> the<00:01:33.850> bottom<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:35.049> do<00:01:35.289> gain<00:01:35.649> a

00:01:35.699 --> 00:01:35.709 
that space at the bottom you do gain a

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:37.320 
that space at the bottom you do gain a
neat<00:01:36.100> little<00:01:36.369> cubby<00:01:36.580> hole<00:01:36.759> in<00:01:36.880> the<00:01:36.970> back<00:01:37.149> but

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
neat little cubby hole in the back but

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.120 
neat little cubby hole in the back but
I'll<00:01:37.420> show<00:01:37.569> you<00:01:37.600> those<00:01:37.810> in<00:01:37.959> the<00:01:38.049> sec<00:01:38.319> now

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
I'll show you those in the sec now

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.070 
I'll show you those in the sec now
Holden's<00:01:39.550> been<00:01:39.700> very<00:01:39.910> careful<00:01:40.420> not<00:01:40.599> to<00:01:40.660> piss

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
Holden's been very careful not to piss

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.859 
Holden's been very careful not to piss
off<00:01:41.349> the<00:01:42.039> minibike<00:01:42.489> market<00:01:43.030> so<00:01:43.539> they've<00:01:43.690> made

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
off the minibike market so they've made

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.660 
off the minibike market so they've made
sure<00:01:44.200> that<00:01:44.530> you<00:01:44.590> can<00:01:44.860> fit<00:01:45.220> a<00:01:45.369> full-size

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
sure that you can fit a full-size

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.630 
sure that you can fit a full-size
minibike<00:01:46.420> on<00:01:46.690> an<00:01:47.020> angle<00:01:47.410> but<00:01:48.190> it's<00:01:48.340> what's<00:01:48.489> in

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
minibike on an angle but it's what's in

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.100 
minibike on an angle but it's what's in
the<00:01:48.759> trave<00:01:49.000> it's<00:01:49.239> the<00:01:49.300> most<00:01:49.450> interesting<00:01:49.989> so

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
the trave it's the most interesting so

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.919 
the trave it's the most interesting so
let's<00:01:50.140> take<00:01:50.470> a<00:01:50.500> look<00:01:51.090> it's<00:01:52.090> got<00:01:52.269> the<00:01:52.330> same<00:01:52.569> peel

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
let's take a look it's got the same peel

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:54.509 
let's take a look it's got the same peel
back<00:01:53.110> system<00:01:53.530> as<00:01:53.649> the<00:01:53.769> last<00:01:53.979> year<00:01:54.190> which<00:01:54.340> is<00:01:54.369> a

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:54.519 
back system as the last year which is a

00:01:54.519 --> 00:01:56.520 
back system as the last year which is a
lot<00:01:54.580> easier<00:01:55.060> on<00:01:55.090> the<00:01:55.269> fingers<00:01:55.629> especially<00:01:56.050> on

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
lot easier on the fingers especially on

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.889 
lot easier on the fingers especially on
a<00:01:56.560> cold<00:01:56.800> morning<00:01:56.920> with<00:01:57.420> what's<00:01:58.420> inside<00:01:58.599> the

a cold morning with what's inside the

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:00.509 
a cold morning with what's inside the
tray<00:01:59.080> that<00:01:59.229> I<00:01:59.319> really<00:01:59.560> like<00:01:59.769> now<00:02:00.250> you<00:02:00.310> get<00:02:00.459> a

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:00.519 
tray that I really like now you get a

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:02.460 
tray that I really like now you get a
tray<00:02:00.789> liner<00:02:01.060> for<00:02:01.300> starters<00:02:01.720> which<00:02:01.929> is<00:02:02.080> great

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470

to<00:02:11.170> take<00:02:11.379> a<00:02:11.410> divider<00:02:11.890> system<00:02:12.430> so<00:02:12.940> if<00:02:13.090> you're

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
to take a divider system so if you're

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.509 
to take a divider system so if you're
carrying<00:02:13.390> a<00:02:13.690> smaller<00:02:13.989> load<00:02:14.319> you<00:02:14.890> can<00:02:15.069> pack<00:02:15.370> it

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
carrying a smaller load you can pack it

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.449
