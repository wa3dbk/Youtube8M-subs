 Tesla s Next Consequences for solid, the space grows on peace when I'm here 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.200
 Mum, at least not in the production version, but we have one here 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.710
 whole city to the market 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.750
 that's not it in the version of Albach and the driver specialist from the 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.730
 Saarland to the box pretty sharp and not only under but 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:23.900
 also about the report 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.110
 the s-max is five centimeters shorter than the Galaxy anyway that is 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.460
 one i hardly test vehicle seven people have room in it so if for example 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.650
 was a complete board quickly to Liechtenstein Dao then wants who the 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.630
 Albacher it grows a fair transport and the applies Gerstner have 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.180
 In the back certainly also place I do not know if you the kun-the sentence of 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.489
 It is definitely worthwhile to deduct one from the tax 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.550
 For example, there is a larger spoiler lip to the grille 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.780
 Alu-look frame is the most important but the car has been around 30 millimeters 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.610
 lowered 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.710
 so the footprint of her side was widened and ten millimeters 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.570
 then there are 20 counters 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.260
 be from MST 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.360
 from the side but quite heavy stature similar to the Galaxy 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.659
 that was a bit relaxed by the sidebar of Albach 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.920
 on the back of a spoiler makes the car mix optically faster that 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.920
 Of course, this is also down here for the indicated diffuser 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.799
 just interior

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.759
 Who likes Halen or when out in Denver? 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:48.270
 that is exactly right here 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.289

 and who likes to see if this is back in the word cinema in the box exactly 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.190
 right there are two toes comma 2 inch screens in front of only 1

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.419
 or for digital TV or iPod video connection 

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:20.699
 only the ice cream seller is not through the ranks but Sabine 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.820
 the leader of the hidden is now 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.820
 always a little guest

 the four-cylinder diesel is by no means necessarily the strongest

 tidy, however, expresses limited 

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:54.199
 just as fast or slow as the series version namely ten number two 

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:56.100
 that's because of miracles 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.150
 that now has even more horsepower but also the larger 20-inch wheels 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.140
 Albert is the chassis specialist and in fast corners 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.010
 Passagenwerk can do that too, Max was back to work 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.379
 have done 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.389
 The string animal through the curves is always in very good condition 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:18.409
 controllable and a large part of the dynamics also contributes to the steering 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:20.209
 the very direct 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.679
 So the s-max makes no faxes in the curves but is very good 

00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:28.899
 controllable and follows very fast on some very precise beside 

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:32.349

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.500
 despite this relatively taut suspension, the bumps just as elegant 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.129
 Blossoms like Müller offered every bump so I can he wanted with this place

 If you can go again 500 or 1000 kilometers in one go
