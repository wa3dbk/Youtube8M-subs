00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
 Hello, I have mine for you today 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.189
 wardrobe will come next time 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.170
 because then, too 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.030
 sometime bio wardrobe online 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.030
 but now we turn first 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.159
 This is my wardrobe 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.269
 so we'll do it now 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.960
 the first is my wardrobe so 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.860
 like you see at the top two 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:05.260
 it is not neat and secure 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.180
 years finally tell me instead of me 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.240
 the first question you have 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.740
 Regulation system in your wardrobe 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.150
 yes I have my order in my systems 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.980
 wardrobe and I sort 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.780
 my wardrobe after colors so 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.280
 mean to this how I sort 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.710
 I look for colors that means they are 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:25.180
 my blue things here are mine white 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:27.729
 I have black things down here 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.869
 my purple pink in things and mine here 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:36.100
 b hours stuff and yes and up here 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:38.950
 I just stop my pulse my question 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.090
 which are your latest ones 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.720
 garments in my latest 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.500
 garments so I actually have 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.500
 only one 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:56.220
 that the companion here from primark users 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:58.229
 here as the left is now unfortunately 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:03.570
 do not care 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:06.509
 So yes that this dress is 3 times 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.590
 you have garments that you never have 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.590
 have carried 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.550
 only have to go 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.550
 the 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.410
 yes, I have 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.000
 this has never been done here, for example 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:33.819
 to watch videos would look like 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:41.590
 but since every t-shirt is already on it 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:42.670
 That's why I had a question 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:49.930
 number four 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:51.670
 show your favorite pieces mine 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.840
 favorite piece is the pants 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:58.440
 I attach with a stain on the age 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.440
 do not expect 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:06.920
 yes so this rose from here then 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:15.680
 once 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:15.680
 I like this hotel of primark very much 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.520
 especially now what's great about that 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.070
 spring summer fits 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:32.350
 visa, this shirt is here with that 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:32.350
 youth eye and then 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.180
 two parts 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.490
 this one 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.000
 I think that's very nice too 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.850
 i could fit into the 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.460
 summer 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:54.880
 and my last favorite part is 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:59.050
 this t shirt slash pullover 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.550
 from primark with now on it and the 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:04.170
 fifth or 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:07.000
 last question is when the embarrassing 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.380
 most embarrassing garment main paris 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:15.400
 Garment is actually a 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:20.200
 beautiful garments only short and 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:24.460
 though it is this dress that is so healing 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:26.140
 because of that and what's embarrassing about it now 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:30.270
 is and as likely as you are 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:34.930
 It can be seen that way 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:36.580
 transparent one could say now and 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.380
 the problem is you know what you mean 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:42.420
 to wear under it because you can 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.490
 see through what you are subject to hate 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.410
 it's actually my dress my 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:53.190
 favorite garment I never again 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:55.050
 That's what happened to me now 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.760
 hope this day you liked it in 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.340
 you will definitely still the 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:03.020
 seen and he me in which we are and 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.020
 say and I say bye
