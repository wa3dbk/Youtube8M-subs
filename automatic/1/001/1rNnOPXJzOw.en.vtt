00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.450
 good evening and welcome to the palace of 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.669
 beaublanc sports after this victory 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.440
 superb limoges csp against the 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:17.610
 defending champion the jsf nanterre for 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.850
 talk to us franck scorer 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:23.640
 goodnight franÃ§ois what a match yes very good 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.290
 match the picture said it will face 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.750
 feurs dass the crisis compared to the game 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.840
 of nancy precisely and so suddenly they 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.370
 have well attacked the first half time 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.170
 we got out took place more posed more 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.320
 patients that 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:43.290
 than some matches and suddenly it's 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.780
 thwart dental and a resident 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.320
 limoges but I show a good basketball 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.370
 and goals 2nd bottom it is forbidden me 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.730
 below 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.739
 suddenly the inter loses confidence and loses 6 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.329
 at the c2 to come back to the score and shoot 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.790
 outside and suddenly it comes in before 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.860
 that finally limoges last the case 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.900
 good match as well in attack as in 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.180
 defense and security 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.160
 yet early in the game have not that 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.390
 was doing a big job under it 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.440
 maybe it was william's entry 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.390
 may not be too much in the stats 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.270
 but it still good hampered 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.010
 interiors the old one quite 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.500
 because it's not going well anymore 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.780
 the moment he plays the Euroleague 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.000
 bronze habit of playing against big 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.130
 chicken underneath so there's having 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.229
 played he wanted a little too much play a 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.180
 little bit to the beefy and but he 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:37.509
 was falling on it quite and suddenly 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:41.050
 they are good he is well he is not 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:42.940
 the purpose of the crazy passing game but he 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.590
 too much sought the conflict to play 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.570
 physical and suddenly he has a little bit 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.490
 wasting that balloons and they did not 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.170
 not so much he did not put the head 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.600
 under water we drink at half time 8 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.740
 on 12 to three points of comment 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.299
 608 for the image 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.469
 what had we talked about all about 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.759
 time against Nancy what had a little 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.530
 sin there the shoots are back 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.270
 why because they were better price 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.829
 and the best screen more patience and 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.140
 because already sedentary so we know 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.819
 than against nanterre and his first if one 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.979
 do not play well we get 20 points so 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.590
 necessarily forced to have a game a lot 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.900
 more laid down I want a lot more 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.400
 long in attack and not to force 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.930
 the shoots and then after 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.349
 play for a long time we have them defend very 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.569
 long time 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.769
 so we're tired more and at 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.540
 very low when we know in this very well 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.530
 when we defend the va seconder then 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.940
 after three three-point baskets 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.400
 on the head it is very very difficult 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.930
 so after morally mentally it's 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.580
 very very hard and I think 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.440
 that indeed the relay of their 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.330
 give them a quick call to 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.060
 tweak in the sense that fatigue 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.730
 to play but that said the Lille I do not 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.870
 want nothing from his victory but a team 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.170
 cut for the dental Euroleague 10 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.880
 players 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.890
 limoges relies mainly on a core of 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.590
 7.8 we can hold a whole season as 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.870
 it can hold a season like that I 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.220
 do not know but it's mostly envied 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.270
 it is especially envied it is necessary that there 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.310
 have a good atmosphere we see an act 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.040
 in earth they are very supportive 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.440
 are we going it is equipped spell that do not 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.730
 the mouth he encourages himself a lot and 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.710
 so that's what you need but 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.500
 it's me I'm going to get there because 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:12.140
 anyway here in limoges with the public 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.090
 who has already stopped is extraordinary 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:18.440
 because I even here I think it's 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:20.720
 false I think it's so I 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.620
 think it's interesting then 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.910
 be careful because it can be 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.530
 also a little bit of pressure for 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.270
 some players but 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.980
 I think it's a match where it allows 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.990
 of a reference match we will say and then 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.120
 it allows some players to take 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.860
 trust and think adrien that's all to 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.959
 done because it's a good it's a good one 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.550
 guy who does it's that's fine he 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.620
 will bring a little bit a little bit 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.750
 the hole right now but hey but he 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.220
 gives a lot of defense he wants 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.810
 do so we want to do well 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.970
 times we donate not good choices 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.380
 but what he did tonight is 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.209
 well and then it also allows others 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.920
 to trust him and then vice 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.480
 therefore the grape harvest by playing 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.880
 this rise had the players for 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.780
 do more play than train so I 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.400
 think matches like that they 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.900
 want to play all the time one last 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.930
 word about the soloists a little bit 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.970
 green hackers an amazing class on 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.200
 saw him tonight some great players when 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.959
 we played with a michael young or 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.970
 players like that level the same 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.510
 dreams when we know we can 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.000
 based on from time to time 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.070
 or two players it's really good 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.570
 because the slightest thing on the screen 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.130
 what are we going to do for the pot for his 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.960
 defender we know that guibord has the ball 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.180
 he'll put in it's nice that more 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.900
 and collective play he does not pull the 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.050
 cover to him 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.370
 it's not a guy who will force and 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.949
 forced precisely I find that on this 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.810
 match there we have the taste to progress to this 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:36.010
 level there before they were looking to get 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.850
 regain confidence to take too much 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.900
 three-point confidence we know that 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.940
 it's a team that will shoot a lot 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.020
 outside at three points so the 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.729
 blow it must be really 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.440
 got to become aware and then 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:48.410
 play collectively but but the 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.090
 players were very good tonight and I 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.909
 think that may well end the year 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:56.330
 especially that gomis will arrive so it's 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:59.050
 a good player in front is someone 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.099
 who will try to get it all 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.449
 who will make a communion with the coach 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:04.340
 so I think so it's at the relay 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.930
 that's exactly so every coach 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.159
 needs a player like that so it's 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.210
 something very good start to 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:09.770
 more so it'll be a nice gift from 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.780
 christmas I think you understood it a 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.639
 100% beneficial evening for limoges csp 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.530
 thank you for being with us at 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:19.659
 soon and then we find ourselves very quickly 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.659
 on the line of the match a good evening
