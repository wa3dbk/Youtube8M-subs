00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.810 

obviously<00:01:58.270> kind<00:01:58.540> of<00:01:58.600> icing<00:01:59.220> consistence

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
obviously kind of icing consistence

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.060 
obviously kind of icing consistence
maybe<00:02:01.450> a<00:02:01.540> little<00:02:01.780> bit<00:02:02.020> thinner<00:02:02.560> than<00:02:02.650> it<00:02:02.920> might

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
maybe a little bit thinner than it might

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:13.380

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.310 

now<00:02:14.350> if<00:02:14.440> you<00:02:14.530> can<00:02:14.680> see<00:02:14.950> that<00:02:15.160> in<00:02:15.340> there<00:02:16.200> it's<00:02:17.200> a

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
now if you can see that in there it's a

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:23.310 
now if you can see that in there it's a
pretty<00:02:19.440> thin<00:02:20.440> consistency<00:02:20.730> like<00:02:21.730> if<00:02:21.880> I<00:02:22.320> do

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
pretty thin consistency like if I do

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:40.000 
pretty thin consistency like if I do
this<00:02:23.500> it<00:02:23.800> runs<00:02:24.580> so<00:02:25.000> it's<00:02:25.180> not<00:02:25.360> real<00:02:25.780> thick

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.960

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.580 
put the blue in or else we'd stir in is
because<00:03:16.760> if<00:03:17.300> you<00:03:17.450> put<00:03:17.690> this<00:03:17.840> in<00:03:18.110> first<00:03:18.350> it'll

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
because if you put this in first it'll

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.290 
because if you put this in first it'll
all<00:03:18.770> sit<00:03:18.950> at<00:03:19.040> the<00:03:19.130> bottom<00:03:19.280> if<00:03:19.760> you<00:03:19.970> put<00:03:20.180> the
