basically<00:01:26.400> detuned<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.450> little<00:01:27.780> bit<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.110> it

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
basically detuned it a little bit so it

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.140 
basically detuned it a little bit so it

makes a little less spa it does make

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.420

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.659 
tyre sections can make the motorcycle
feel<00:03:45.480> a<00:03:45.510> bit<00:03:45.780> on<00:03:45.959> edge<00:03:46.349> in<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:46.769> corners<00:03:47.160> though

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
feel a bit on edge in the corners though

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.460 
feel a bit on edge in the corners though
I<00:03:47.700> have<00:03:48.030> to<00:03:48.239> say<00:03:48.419> the<00:03:48.540> gyro<00:03:48.780> grips<00:03:49.079> aren't

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
I have to say the gyro grips aren't

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.870 
I have to say the gyro grips aren't
really<00:03:49.739> all<00:03:49.859> that<00:03:49.950> short<00:03:50.519> contraction

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
really all that short contraction

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.480 
really all that short contraction
but<00:03:52.240> handling<00:03:52.630> is<00:03:52.810> in<00:03:53.110> the<00:03:53.230> 125<00:03:53.710> M<00:03:54.010> central

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 
but handling is in the 125 M central

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.910 
but handling is in the 125 M central
requirement<00:03:55.000> in<00:03:55.120> any<00:03:55.270> case<00:03:55.750> it<00:03:56.110> is<00:03:56.140> a<00:03:56.500> hardcore

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
requirement in any case it is a hardcore

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.740 
requirement in any case it is a hardcore
commuter<00:03:57.520> aiming<00:03:58.000> for<00:03:58.180> the<00:03:58.240> heart<00:03:58.450> of<00:03:58.600> that

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
commuter aiming for the heart of that

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.230 
commuter aiming for the heart of that
segment<00:03:59.020> and<00:03:59.380> all<00:03:59.830> it<00:04:00.100> needs<00:04:00.130> to<00:04:00.400> do<00:04:00.670> really<00:04:00.940> is

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.240 
segment and all it needs to do really is

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.670 
segment and all it needs to do really is
stand<00:04:01.750> out<00:04:01.900> enough<00:04:03.870> in<00:04:04.870> terms<00:04:05.050> of<00:04:05.200> styling<00:04:05.590> the

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
stand out enough in terms of styling the

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.710 
stand out enough in terms of styling the
125<00:04:06.190> M<00:04:06.310> doesn't<00:04:06.790> really<00:04:06.970> break<00:04:07.240> new<00:04:07.450> ground

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
125 M doesn't really break new ground

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.210 
125 M doesn't really break new ground
but<00:04:08.050> you've<00:04:08.200> got<00:04:08.380> is<00:04:08.530> a<00:04:08.560> slightly<00:04:08.890> smaller

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
but you've got is a slightly smaller

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.890 
but you've got is a slightly smaller
fuel<00:04:09.550> tank<00:04:09.880> familiar<00:04:10.270> bodywork<00:04:10.720> new

fuel tank familiar bodywork new

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:11.430 
fuel tank familiar bodywork new
stickering

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
stickering

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.310 
stickering
but<00:04:11.950> if<00:04:12.190> you<00:04:12.340> look<00:04:12.520> closer<00:04:12.850> I<00:04:13.180> really<00:04:14.140> like

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
but if you look closer I really like

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.870 
but if you look closer I really like
these<00:04:14.500> light<00:04:14.740> colors<00:04:14.950> especially<00:04:15.340> the<00:04:15.700> white

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
these light colors especially the white

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.490 
these light colors especially the white
one<00:04:16.120> with<00:04:16.270> the<00:04:16.360> blue<00:04:16.510> stickers<00:04:16.900> because<00:04:17.230> the

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
one with the blue stickers because the

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.199 
one with the blue stickers because the
lighter<00:04:17.739> colors<00:04:18.130> give<00:04:18.430> the<00:04:18.610> motorcycle<00:04:19.150> a

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
lighter colors give the motorcycle a

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.030 
lighter colors give the motorcycle a
sense<00:04:19.450> of<00:04:19.630> more<00:04:19.930> mass<00:04:20.230> and<00:04:20.470> I<00:04:20.500> think<00:04:20.860> that's

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
sense of more mass and I think that's

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.220 
sense of more mass and I think that's
important<00:04:21.580> because<00:04:21.970> this<00:04:22.420> is<00:04:22.630> actually<00:04:23.200> a

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
important because this is actually a

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.500 
important because this is actually a
pretty<00:04:23.590> small<00:04:23.920> motorcycle<00:04:27.150> you<00:04:28.150> can<00:04:28.180> buy<00:04:28.450> the

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
pretty small motorcycle you can buy the

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.630 
pretty small motorcycle you can buy the
discover<00:04:28.960> 125<00:04:29.140> right<00:04:29.770> now<00:04:29.950> in<00:04:30.070> the<00:04:30.190> market<00:04:30.490> and

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
discover 125 right now in the market and

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.940 
discover 125 right now in the market and
in<00:04:30.730> pricing<00:04:31.150> terms<00:04:31.390> it's<00:04:31.570> it's<00:04:31.780> roughly<00:04:32.320> 6,000

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
in pricing terms it's it's roughly 6,000

rupees<00:04:33.040> below<00:04:33.460> the<00:04:33.580> Honda<00:04:33.910> shine<00:04:34.150> and<00:04:34.420> a<00:04:34.870> type

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
rupees below the Honda shine and a type

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.140 
rupees below the Honda shine and a type
price<00:04:35.470> point<00:04:35.770> at<00:04:35.950> that<00:04:36.430> difference<00:04:36.910> to<00:04:36.970> the

price point at that difference to the

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.790 
price point at that difference to the
shine<00:04:37.390> I<00:04:37.570> do<00:04:37.870> think<00:04:38.350> this<00:04:38.440> is<00:04:38.500> a<00:04:38.590> pretty

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
shine I do think this is a pretty

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.740 
shine I do think this is a pretty
convincing<00:04:39.160> city<00:04:39.580> bike<00:04:39.790> to<00:04:39.970> own<00:04:40.150> it's<00:04:40.630> really

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
convincing city bike to own it's really

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.500 
convincing city bike to own it's really
nice<00:04:41.290> light<00:04:41.680> and<00:04:41.890> nimble<00:04:42.040> the<00:04:42.940> only<00:04:43.270> thing<00:04:43.420> it

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
nice light and nimble the only thing it

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.060 
nice light and nimble the only thing it
probably<00:04:43.840> doesn't<00:04:44.200> like<00:04:44.290> a<00:04:44.350> sharp<00:04:44.740> bumps<00:04:44.980> at

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
probably doesn't like a sharp bumps at

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.530 
probably doesn't like a sharp bumps at
high<00:04:45.190> speed<00:04:45.490> which<00:04:45.670> again<00:04:46.000> in<00:04:46.120> the<00:04:46.210> city<00:04:46.390> you

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
high speed which again in the city you

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.630 
high speed which again in the city you
won't<00:04:46.780> really<00:04:47.020> do<00:04:47.350> that<00:04:47.500> much<00:04:47.680> of<00:04:47.890> economy<00:04:48.580> is

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:48.640 
won't really do that much of economy is

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.250 
won't really do that much of economy is
pretty<00:04:48.910> good<00:04:49.120> the<00:04:49.540> performance<00:04:49.720> is<00:04:50.140> pretty

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
pretty good the performance is pretty

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.820 
pretty good the performance is pretty
decent

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
decent

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.800 
decent
so<00:04:51.070> overall<00:04:51.430> Bajaj<00:04:51.850> have<00:04:52.000> done<00:04:52.150> one<00:04:52.450> more<00:04:52.690> of

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
so overall Bajaj have done one more of

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
what they keep doing over and over again

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.160 
what they keep doing over and over again
they<00:04:55.000> produce<00:04:55.210> these<00:04:55.450> motorcycles<00:04:56.080> that
