 from say when new schoolbloggers 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.330
 yesterday I was asked what kind of mermaid I am 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.220
 would choose the one from which the human bottom 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.530
 respectively with the legs and vagina either 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.320
 that which is human up with head 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.820
 mouth but fish tail without vagina 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.760
 I answered quickly because for me this 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:32.620
 the question is not complicated I adore oral sex 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.620
