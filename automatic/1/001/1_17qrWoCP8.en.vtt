lots of them I have rivers I have
reverses<00:00:37.440> from<00:00:37.559> Pleiadians<00:00:38.370> who<00:00:38.550> used<00:00:38.730> my

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
reverses from Pleiadians who used my

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.240 
reverses from Pleiadians who used my
voice<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.629> communicate<00:00:39.780> with<00:00:40.379> me

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
voice to communicate with me

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.869 
voice to communicate with me
lots<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:42.440> reversals<00:00:43.440> referring<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.640> one

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
lots of reversals referring to the one

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.150 
lots of reversals referring to the one
or<00:00:45.149> God<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:46.170> know<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.440> how<00:00:46.590> things<00:00:46.829> are<00:00:47.010> going

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
or God you know and how things are going

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.389 
or God you know and how things are going
to<00:00:47.280> be<00:00:47.430> so<00:00:47.760> much<00:00:47.969> better<00:00:48.210> in<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.050> short<00:00:49.399> right

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
to be so much better in the short right

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.979 
to be so much better in the short right
after<00:00:50.700> we<00:00:50.789> get<00:00:50.940> through<00:00:51.180> this<00:00:51.360> what's<00:00:51.660> coming

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
after we get through this what's coming

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.010 
after we get through this what's coming
up<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:53.070> what<00:00:53.969> percentage<00:00:54.480> do<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.690> get<00:00:54.899> for

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
up and what percentage do you get for

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.590 
up and what percentage do you get for
getting<00:00:55.289> good<00:00:55.440> reversals<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:57.000> think<00:00:57.390> for

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
getting good reversals I think for

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.099 
getting good reversals I think for
top-quality<00:00:57.989> about<00:00:58.559> 5%<00:00:59.300> but<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.329> can<00:01:00.690> hear<00:01:00.960> I

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
top-quality about 5% but I can hear I

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.770 
top-quality about 5% but I can hear I
probably<00:01:01.500> on<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:01.949> good<00:01:02.280> recording<00:01:03.149> on<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.480> good

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
probably on a good recording on a good

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.679 
probably on a good recording on a good
audio<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.589> can<00:01:04.920> probably<00:01:05.189> pick<00:01:05.580> up<00:01:06.229> 40<00:01:07.229> 40<00:01:08.220> %<00:01:08.790> in

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
audio I can probably pick up 40 40 % in

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.020 
audio I can probably pick up 40 40 % in
reverse<00:01:10.200> but<00:01:10.650> that's<00:01:10.890> because<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.400> have

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
reverse but that's because I have

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.880 
reverse but that's because I have
listened<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:12.689> much<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.290> my<00:01:13.380> ears<00:01:13.619> are<00:01:13.770> really

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
listened so much and my ears are really

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.880 
listened so much and my ears are really
clued<00:01:14.850> in<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.240> once<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:16.020> get<00:01:16.290> into<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.710> flow

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
clued in and once you get into the flow

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.380 
clued in and once you get into the flow
of<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.310> it's<00:01:17.520> almost<00:01:17.640> like<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.880> listen<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.360> a

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
of it it's almost like you listen to a

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.140 
of it it's almost like you listen to a
story<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.229> maybe<00:01:19.650> slur<00:01:20.159> maybe<00:01:20.729> some<00:01:20.939> bad

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
story and maybe slur maybe some bad

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.030 
story and maybe slur maybe some bad
grammar<00:01:21.509> but<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.200> know<00:01:22.290> you're<00:01:22.439> getting<00:01:22.890> it

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
grammar but you know you're getting it

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.070 
grammar but you know you're getting it
getting<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.700> if<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.420> just<00:01:24.570> sit<00:01:24.780> down<00:01:24.810> with

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
getting it if you just sit down with

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.570 
getting it if you just sit down with
somebody<00:01:25.290> else<00:01:25.560> in<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.830> room<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.280> play<00:01:26.549> a

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
somebody else in the room and you play a

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.149 
somebody else in the room and you play a
reversal<00:01:27.479> if<00:01:27.900> they're<00:01:28.170> not<00:01:28.380> used<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.890> hearing

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
reversal if they're not used to hearing

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.789 
reversal if they're not used to hearing
it<00:01:29.430> or<00:01:29.700> it's<00:01:29.850> out<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.060> context<00:01:31.020> they're<00:01:31.650> gonna

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
it or it's out of context they're gonna

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.190 
it or it's out of context they're gonna
have<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.009> much<00:01:32.250> harder<00:01:32.520> time<00:01:33.200> understanding

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
have a much harder time understanding

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
would have to reverse somebody I'm

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.749 
would have to reverse somebody I'm
talking<00:01:58.560> about<00:01:58.649> their<00:01:59.009> automatic<00:01:59.340> writing

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
talking about their automatic writing

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.819 
talking about their automatic writing
but<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.390> can<00:02:00.689> tell<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.409> have<00:02:01.649> never

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.270 
but I can tell you that I have never
reversed<00:02:02.250> anything

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
reversed anything

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.030 
reversed anything
that<00:02:04.280> it<00:02:04.370> wasn't<00:02:04.520> manipulated<00:02:05.530> so<00:02:06.530> if<00:02:06.830> you're

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
that it wasn't manipulated so if you're
