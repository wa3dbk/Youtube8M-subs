00:00:03.291 --> 00:00:04.875
That's pretty - is it cashmere?

00:00:04.875 --> 00:00:06.083
Cotton!

00:00:06.083 --> 00:00:07.666
Tiffany,

00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:09.083
I don't want to bother you...

00:00:09.083 --> 00:00:10.666
...but can I sleep over?

00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:12.250
I lost my mother this morning.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:13.208
She died?

00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:15.041
No, I lost her.

00:00:15.041 --> 00:00:17.291
She was there and then - poof! - I lost her.

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.375
But my dog died.

00:00:20.375 --> 00:00:22.291
So if I could sleep over...

00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:24.250
...just to have someone around.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.833
Your dog died 3 times.

00:00:26.375 --> 00:00:27.958
He suffered horribly.

00:00:29.583 --> 00:00:31.041
You said we'd have dinner.

00:00:31.041 --> 00:00:33.166
So, since the festival's almost over...

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.875
I completely forgot!

00:00:34.875 --> 00:00:37.458
I'm going to a hop
with my main squeeze.

00:00:37.458 --> 00:00:40.166
That's the 7th time you forgot.

00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:41.666
I'm so sorry.

00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.416
It's the festival.
All this pressure...

00:00:43.416 --> 00:00:45.000
You promised.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.583
I'm going to tell you something:

00:00:46.583 --> 00:00:48.166
That's pretty - is it cashmere?

00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:49.750
You can't fool one person
a thousand times...

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.791
Yes. You can fool, uh...

00:00:51.791 --> 00:00:54.416
...1 000 persons once,...
uh... 1 000 times...

00:00:54.416 --> 00:00:58.625
No! You can fool
one time a thousand...

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:01.208
We can't fool a thousand times...

00:01:01.208 --> 00:01:02.791
I got to go.

00:01:02.791 --> 00:01:04.375
Bye, Emile.

00:01:04.375 --> 00:01:05.958
...a thousand times. Right.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.791
Thanks. And bring us some snapawogs...

00:01:12.083 --> 00:01:13.666
...to peck on.

00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:18.541
Two venison legs..

00:01:18.541 --> 00:01:20.125
it's for two.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.291
Two venison legs,
firm...

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.083
...and slightly parted...

00:01:30.208 --> 00:01:32.541
...and stuffed with thick cream...

00:01:33.708 --> 00:01:35.750
...drenched in hot white wine, dripping...

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.041
...over the fleshy part...

00:01:38.041 --> 00:01:39.625
...of the animal.

00:01:44.541 --> 00:01:45.583
Whisky?

00:01:45.583 --> 00:01:46.791
Just a finger.

00:01:46.791 --> 00:01:48.375
Don't want a whisky first?

00:01:55.083 --> 00:01:57.375
I'm sorry, I stopped smoking
I'm a bit nervous.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.166
"Also from Cannes,
the strange murder...

00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:04.041
...of a projectionist
at the Cameo Theater...

00:02:04.041 --> 00:02:07.583
...who was projecting a horror movie."

00:02:08.833 --> 00:02:12.041
"And now; for our Belgian friends
who love arugula,.."

00:02:15.583 --> 00:02:17.166
Here comes lethal weapon.

00:02:20.125 --> 00:02:21.458
Hello!

00:02:21.458 --> 00:02:22.625
Where were you?

00:02:24.416 --> 00:02:28.250
Well, I had to take care of...

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.458
How could I trust
a guy like that?

00:02:30.458 --> 00:02:32.375
Come on!
I just had a few too many.

00:02:32.375 --> 00:02:34.625
Shut up, Kara. Not you.

00:02:34.625 --> 00:02:36.208
I was talking about Patrick...

00:02:37.375 --> 00:02:40.291
One thing about the murders.
I have a theory.

00:02:40.291 --> 00:02:42.833
I'm pwetty sure it's a sewial kiwuh.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.583
What?

00:02:45.583 --> 00:02:47.500
I think it's a sewial kiwuh.

00:02:48.375 --> 00:02:49.125
A what?

00:02:49.791 --> 00:02:50.958
A sewial kiwuh

00:02:52.083 --> 00:02:53.208
Hu?..

00:02:53.208 --> 00:02:55.458
A serial killer.
A killer in series.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.333
Sewial kiwuh.

00:02:59.833 --> 00:03:01.416
Biales has the profile.

00:03:01.416 --> 00:03:06.208
He has everything they describe
in F.B.I. studies.

00:03:08.458 --> 00:03:12.916
Which is stronger,
the hippopotamus or the elephant?

00:03:12.916 --> 00:03:15.875
'Cause a hippo is pretty strong.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.250
Aren't you hungry?

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.916
I'm hungry,

00:03:21.208 --> 00:03:22.958
I'm hungry, hungry...

00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.375
Can I be honest?

00:03:24.375 --> 00:03:25.500
You're a pain.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.833
Yeah, but I'm still hungry.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.333
If you have to step out
a second, then go ahead.

00:03:37.333 --> 00:03:38.666
I can't leave you alone.

00:03:38.666 --> 00:03:39.708
But you're sick.

00:03:39.708 --> 00:03:40.791
Go relieve yourself.

00:03:40.791 --> 00:03:41.375
What?

00:03:41.375 --> 00:03:42.708
Relieve yourself.

00:03:47.333 --> 00:03:48.666
It stinks in here.

00:03:49.208 --> 00:03:50.166
I'm going.

00:03:50.166 --> 00:03:51.041
By all means.

00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:52.208
Go ahead.

00:03:57.416 --> 00:03:59.000
Fuck! I don't need this.

00:04:09.291 --> 00:04:10.625
I really got to shit!

00:04:29.541 --> 00:04:30.875
Outa the way, fucking mimes!

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.333
Odile?

00:04:46.666 --> 00:04:48.625
Know the difference between a fridge and a woman?

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.916
No.

00:04:52.333 --> 00:04:53.666
It's so silly.

00:04:55.458 --> 00:04:56.916
A fridge doesn't moan
when you take...

00:05:01.458 --> 00:05:02.791
...your meat out.

00:05:05.416 --> 00:05:06.416
Pretty funny, hunh?

00:05:07.416 --> 00:05:08.833
A little racy,

00:05:09.416 --> 00:05:10.333
but funny.

00:05:10.333 --> 00:05:10.958
No?

00:05:14.208 --> 00:05:15.250
Odile?
