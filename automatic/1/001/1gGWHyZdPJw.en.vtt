the 11 gauge steel support mechanisms

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.670 
the 11 gauge steel support mechanisms
here<00:02:30.790> so<00:02:31.000> there's<00:02:31.180> nothing<00:02:31.600> that's<00:02:31.810> on<00:02:32.020> the

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
here so there's nothing that's on the

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.370 
here so there's nothing that's on the
outside<00:02:32.709> that<00:02:33.220> can<00:02:33.700> create<00:02:34.000> a<00:02:34.060> pinch<00:02:34.330> point<00:02:34.660> it

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.000 
outside that can create a pinch point it
also<00:02:35.709> created<00:02:36.130> a<00:02:36.250> very<00:02:36.550> clean<00:02:36.970> aesthetic<00:02:38.010> if

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
also created a very clean aesthetic if

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.710 
also created a very clean aesthetic if
you'll<00:02:39.310> notice<00:02:39.640> there<00:02:39.880> is<00:02:39.910> dirty<00:02:40.450> of<00:02:40.540> these

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
you'll notice there is dirty of these

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:47.250 
you'll notice there is dirty of these
engines<00:02:41.350> are<00:02:42.060> all<00:02:43.590> similar<00:02:44.590> dimension<00:02:45.959> so<00:02:46.959> we

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
engines are all similar dimension so we

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.130 
engines are all similar dimension so we

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.270 
actually works by removing the plates
and<00:03:32.370> one<00:03:33.370> side<00:03:33.670> of<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:33.940> mechanism<00:03:34.510> you'll<00:03:34.690> see

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
and one side of the mechanism you'll see

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.509 
and one side of the mechanism you'll see
that<00:03:36.280> this<00:03:37.590> tilting<00:03:38.590> through<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.160> range<00:03:39.370> of
