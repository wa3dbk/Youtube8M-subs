this<00:01:59.850> isn't<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.240> view<00:02:00.390> finder<00:02:00.659> this<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.290> just

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
this isn't the view finder this is just

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.890 
this isn't the view finder this is just
a<00:02:01.530> prototype<00:02:01.770> camera<00:02:02.400> again<00:02:02.580> the<00:02:03.540> new<00:02:03.659> view

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
a prototype camera again the new view

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.750 
a prototype camera again the new view
finder<00:02:04.290> will<00:02:04.470> be<00:02:04.710> higher<00:02:04.950> resolution<00:02:05.729> than

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
finder will be higher resolution than

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.180 
finder will be higher resolution than
the<00:02:06.120> current<00:02:06.510> view<00:02:06.720> finder<00:02:07.080> and<00:02:07.229> been<00:02:07.860> told<00:02:08.069> it

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
the current view finder and been told it

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.570 
the current view finder and been told it
looks<00:02:08.280> great<00:02:08.520> but

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
looks great but

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.250 
looks great but
the<00:02:09.910> prototype<00:02:10.480> so<00:02:10.690> I<00:02:10.720> haven't<00:02:10.990> seen<00:02:11.170> it

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
the prototype so I haven't seen it

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.900 
the prototype so I haven't seen it
myself<00:02:11.800> and<00:02:14.250> another<00:02:15.250> issue<00:02:15.430> that<00:02:15.760> is<00:02:15.880> a

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
myself and another issue that is a

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.360 
myself and another issue that is a
problem<00:02:16.330> with<00:02:16.480> some<00:02:16.810> issue<00:02:17.260> with<00:02:17.440> CMOS

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
problem with some issue with CMOS

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.730 
problem with some issue with CMOS
cameras<00:02:18.910> it's<00:02:19.210> called<00:02:19.390> flash<00:02:19.600> banding<00:02:20.200> this

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
cameras it's called flash banding this

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.100 
cameras it's called flash banding this
camera<00:02:21.160> has<00:02:21.520> a<00:02:21.580> circuitry<00:02:22.240> to<00:02:22.420> fix<00:02:22.780> flash

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
camera has a circuitry to fix flash

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.920 
camera has a circuitry to fix flash
banding<00:02:23.590> on<00:02:23.740> the<00:02:24.010> fly<00:02:24.250> so<00:02:24.940> if<00:02:25.270> you're<00:02:25.450> shooting

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
banding on the fly so if you're shooting

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.270 
banding on the fly so if you're shooting
weddings<00:02:26.200> and<00:02:26.530> you<00:02:26.590> have<00:02:26.680> photographers

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
weddings and you have photographers

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.040 
weddings and you have photographers
taking<00:02:27.550> flashes<00:02:28.180> and<00:02:28.300> just<00:02:28.450> causing<00:02:28.840> some

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
issues with your CMOS sensors turn on

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.090 
issues with your CMOS sensors turn on
the<00:02:31.420> flash<00:02:31.630> banding<00:02:32.110> correction<00:02:32.590> and<00:02:32.770> it'll

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
the flash banding correction and it'll

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.440 
the flash banding correction and it'll
automatically<00:02:33.550> correct<00:02:33.910> for<00:02:34.060> those<00:02:34.150> flash
