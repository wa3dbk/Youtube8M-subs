there wasn't a lot of places where you

can have your children learn to swim
make<00:01:29.680> a<00:01:29.710> splash<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:31.060> program<00:01:31.360> is<00:01:31.630> unique<00:01:31.960> in

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
make a splash that program is unique in

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.910 
make a splash that program is unique in
that<00:01:32.820> its<00:01:33.820> focus<00:01:34.210> is<00:01:34.690> water<00:01:35.110> safety<00:01:35.440> for

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
that its focus is water safety for

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.920 
that its focus is water safety for
communities<00:01:36.580> who<00:01:36.729> typically<00:01:37.180> would<00:01:37.479> not<00:01:37.720> have

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
communities who typically would not have

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.499 
communities who typically would not have
the<00:01:38.080> opportunity<00:01:38.740> I<00:01:39.119> think<00:01:40.119> it's<00:01:40.240> best<00:01:40.420> for

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
the opportunity I think it's best for

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:42.510 
the opportunity I think it's best for
any<00:01:40.780> child<00:01:40.990> to<00:01:41.170> learn<00:01:41.350> to<00:01:41.530> swim<00:01:41.800> so<00:01:42.220> they<00:01:42.340> won't

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
any child to learn to swim so they won't

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.570 
any child to learn to swim so they won't
ever<00:01:42.700> get<00:01:42.850> any<00:01:43.150> trouble<00:01:43.540> in<00:01:43.660> the<00:01:43.780> water<00:01:44.580> when

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
ever get any trouble in the water when

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:46.890 
ever get any trouble in the water when
the<00:01:45.670> children<00:01:46.060> first<00:01:46.240> start<00:01:46.630> with<00:01:46.780> the

the children first start with the
