so I started JW black guitars
specifically<00:05:43.479> in<00:05:43.600> mind<00:05:43.840> to<00:05:44.200> create<00:05:44.440> an

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
specifically in mind to create an

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.460 
specifically in mind to create an

made<00:05:47.650> a<00:05:47.680> great<00:05:48.070> 53<00:05:48.760> tally<00:05:49.030> was<00:05:49.539> basically<00:05:49.990> the

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:50.260 
made a great 53 tally was basically the

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.890 
made a great 53 tally was basically the
tone<00:05:50.500> the<00:05:50.740> character<00:05:51.220> the<00:05:51.430> magic<00:05:51.910> of<00:05:52.060> the<00:05:52.660> wood

and<00:05:53.260> the<00:05:53.440> way<00:05:53.590> it<00:05:53.710> expressed<00:05:54.190> itself<00:05:54.419> but<00:05:55.419> also

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810 
and the way it expressed itself but also

50s and I feel it gives it a character
and<00:07:00.760> tone<00:07:01.000> that<00:07:01.270> as<00:07:01.390> the<00:07:01.720> guitar<00:07:02.050> ages<00:07:02.650> with

and tone that as the guitar ages with

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.580 
and tone that as the guitar ages with
your<00:07:03.460> own<00:07:03.580> particular<00:07:04.180> playing<00:07:04.570> style<00:07:04.990> you

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:05.590 
your own particular playing style you

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:08.460 
your own particular playing style you
can<00:07:05.800> hear<00:07:06.250> what<00:07:07.090> an<00:07:07.270> old<00:07:07.570> guitar<00:07:07.960> sounded<00:07:08.320> like

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:08.470 
can hear what an old guitar sounded like

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.260 
can hear what an old guitar sounded like
but<00:07:08.740> it<00:07:08.830> will<00:07:08.890> still<00:07:09.160> pluck<00:07:09.640> a<00:07:09.670> new<00:07:09.910> modern

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:10.270
