00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
released this fall and one of the

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.929 
released this fall and one of the
features<00:03:41.659> that<00:03:41.689> isn't<00:03:42.349> a<00:03:42.530> big<00:03:42.889> deal<00:03:42.919> for<00:03:43.220> Apple

00:03:43.929 --> 00:03:43.939 
features that isn't a big deal for Apple

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:45.460 
features that isn't a big deal for Apple
but<00:03:44.060> i<00:03:44.090> think<00:03:44.299> is<00:03:44.389> interesting<00:03:44.569> in<00:03:44.959> this<00:03:45.199> case

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
but i think is interesting in this case

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.319 
but i think is interesting in this case
is<00:03:45.650> that<00:03:45.919> applications<00:03:46.639> get<00:03:46.819> automatically

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
is that applications get automatically

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.420 
is that applications get automatically
updated<00:03:47.930> without<00:03:48.319> you<00:03:48.769> having<00:03:48.949> to<00:03:49.069> go<00:03:49.250> through

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
updated without you having to go through

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.129 
updated without you having to go through
and<00:03:49.519> do<00:03:49.669> that<00:03:49.879> and<00:03:50.060> i<00:03:50.449> think<00:03:50.629> that's<00:03:50.780> important

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:51.139 
and do that and i think that's important

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:53.349 
and do that and i think that's important
because<00:03:51.259> some<00:03:52.250> of<00:03:52.280> the<00:03:52.549> features<00:03:52.939> that<00:03:53.150> we

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.359 
because some of the features that we

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:55.929 
because some of the features that we
have<00:03:53.479> planned<00:03:53.810> for<00:03:54.079> this<00:03:54.169> application<00:03:54.409> are<00:03:55.069> i

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:55.939 
have planned for this application are i

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:58.990 
have planned for this application are i
think<00:03:56.319> total<00:03:57.319> game<00:03:57.560> changers<00:03:58.189> in<00:03:58.370> the<00:03:58.819> world

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
think total game changers in the world

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.420 
think total game changers in the world
of<00:03:59.150> music<00:03:59.449> education<00:03:59.540> and<00:04:00.169> i<00:04:00.439> can't<00:04:01.009> say<00:04:01.250> more

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
of music education and i can't say more

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.710 
of music education and i can't say more
than<00:04:01.489> that<00:04:01.609> because<00:04:01.759> it's<00:04:02.030> obviously<00:04:02.569> these

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
than that because it's obviously these

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.780 
than that because it's obviously these
things<00:04:02.930> are<00:04:03.019> up<00:04:03.109> in<00:04:03.229> the<00:04:03.319> air<00:04:03.349> but<00:04:04.069> if<00:04:04.220> you're

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
things are up in the air but if you're

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.879 
things are up in the air but if you're
curious<00:04:05.150> about<00:04:05.359> that<00:04:05.629> i<00:04:05.689> should<00:04:06.199> i'll<00:04:06.530> say

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:06.889 
curious about that i should i'll say
