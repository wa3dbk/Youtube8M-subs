technology<00:00:09.480> really<00:00:09.990> affects<00:00:10.260> our<00:00:10.380> brains<00:00:10.650> in

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
technology really affects our brains in

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.890 
technology really affects our brains in
multiple<00:00:11.370> ways<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:12.179> it's<00:00:12.480> something<00:00:12.690> that's

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
multiple ways and it's something that's

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.160 
multiple ways and it's something that's
been<00:00:13.110> happening<00:00:13.320> for<00:00:14.040> decades<00:00:14.570> really<00:00:15.570> the

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
been happening for decades really the

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.960 
been happening for decades really the
first<00:00:16.379> actually<00:00:16.890> has<00:00:17.070> to<00:00:17.220> deal<00:00:17.400> with<00:00:17.460> our

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
first actually has to deal with our

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.000 
first actually has to deal with our
ability<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.390> concentrate<00:00:18.930> what<00:00:19.470> happens<00:00:19.830> when

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
ability to concentrate what happens when

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.470 
ability to concentrate what happens when
we<00:00:20.100> think<00:00:20.310> we're<00:00:20.460> multitasking<00:00:20.730> is<00:00:21.300> we're

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
we think we're multitasking is we're

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.630 
we think we're multitasking is we're
really<00:00:21.630> task<00:00:21.990> switching<00:00:22.470> very<00:00:23.039> very<00:00:23.310> quickly

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
really task switching very very quickly

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.880 
really task switching very very quickly
so<00:00:24.330> your<00:00:24.449> attention<00:00:24.930> goes<00:00:25.109> from<00:00:25.410> one<00:00:25.619> thing<00:00:25.650> to

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
so your attention goes from one thing to

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:26.450 
so your attention goes from one thing to
another

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
another

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.429 
another
so<00:00:27.029> rapidly<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.720> don't<00:00:27.930> really<00:00:28.109> think

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
so rapidly that you don't really think

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.259 
so rapidly that you don't really think
about<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:29.220> you<00:00:29.310> think<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:29.670> really<00:00:30.029> are

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
about it you think you really are

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.600 
about it you think you really are
splitting<00:00:30.929> your<00:00:31.109> attention<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.830> instead

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
splitting your attention and instead

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.000 
splitting your attention and instead
it's<00:00:32.820> just<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.390> very<00:00:33.809> cognitively<00:00:34.410> taxing

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
it's just a very cognitively taxing

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.430 
it's just a very cognitively taxing
process<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.730> keep<00:00:35.880> going<00:00:36.090> back<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.390> forth<00:00:36.809> it

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
process to keep going back and forth it

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.380 
process to keep going back and forth it
tires<00:00:37.710> us<00:00:37.920> out<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.489> makes<00:00:38.670> us<00:00:38.850> less<00:00:39.149> able

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
tires us out and it makes us less able

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.930 
tires us out and it makes us less able
to<00:00:39.570> concentrate<00:00:40.079> on<00:00:40.469> one<00:00:41.010> thing<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.489> it

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
to concentrate on one thing so it

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.299 
to concentrate on one thing so it
actually<00:00:42.360> does<00:00:42.629> lower<00:00:43.020> your<00:00:43.410> attention<00:00:44.040> span

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
actually does lower your attention span

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.010 
actually does lower your attention span
we<00:00:44.730> have<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.210> wonderful<00:00:45.660> thing<00:00:45.690> called

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
we have this wonderful thing called

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.389 
we have this wonderful thing called
Google<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.710> it's<00:00:46.860> great<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.160> can<00:00:47.250> look

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
Google and it's great you can look

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.529 
Google and it's great you can look
anything<00:00:47.700> up<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.149> can<00:00:48.270> look<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.480> up

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
anything up and you can look it up

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.779 
anything up and you can look it up
basically<00:00:48.960> instantaneously<00:00:49.950> but<00:00:50.430> what

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
basically instantaneously but what

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.939 
basically instantaneously but what
happens<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.449> memory<00:00:51.780> if<00:00:52.140> your<00:00:52.379> brain<00:00:52.590> knows

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
happens to memory if your brain knows

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.080 
happens to memory if your brain knows
that<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.340> can<00:00:53.370> look<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.760> up

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
that it can look it up

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.369 
that it can look it up
it<00:00:54.180> doesn't<00:00:54.570> actually<00:00:54.660> retain<00:00:55.230> the

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
it doesn't actually retain the

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.410 
it doesn't actually retain the
information<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.640> things<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.090> read

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
information so things that you read

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.240 
information so things that you read
online<00:00:57.600> unless<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.710> make<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.890> conscious

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
online unless you make a conscious

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.250 
online unless you make a conscious
effort<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.910> remember<00:01:00.149> them<00:01:00.480> you're<00:01:00.840> going<00:01:01.140> to

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
effort to remember them you're going to

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.080 
effort to remember them you're going to
forget<00:01:01.590> them<00:01:01.800> what<00:01:02.309> you'll<00:01:02.430> remember<00:01:02.850> instead

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
forget them what you'll remember instead

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.549 
forget them what you'll remember instead
is<00:01:03.329> how<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.570> find<00:01:03.870> them<00:01:04.019> again<00:01:04.110> what

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
is how to find them again what

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.399 
is how to find them again what
technology<00:01:05.280> does<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.939> it's<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.630> constant

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
technology does is it's this constant

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.649 
technology does is it's this constant
hot<00:01:07.830> trigger<00:01:08.250> because<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.299> makes<00:01:09.510> our

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
hot trigger because it makes our

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.469 
hot trigger because it makes our
environment<00:01:10.290> aligned<00:01:10.830> with<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.220> desire<00:01:11.610> to

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
environment aligned with that desire to

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.800 
environment aligned with that desire to
have<00:01:12.840> our<00:01:12.990> brain<00:01:13.260> flip<00:01:14.040> from<00:01:14.310> thing<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.580> thing

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
have our brain flip from thing to thing

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.210 
have our brain flip from thing to thing
basically<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:15.960> gets<00:01:16.200> us<00:01:16.409> at<00:01:16.619> our<00:01:16.650> weakest

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
basically it gets us at our weakest

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.480 
basically it gets us at our weakest
point<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.210> really<00:01:18.750> feeds<00:01:19.080> into<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.890> not

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
point and it really feeds into that not

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.600 
point and it really feeds into that not
very<00:01:20.659> good<00:01:21.659> for<00:01:21.869> us<00:01:21.900> desire<00:01:22.770> it's<00:01:23.070> like<00:01:23.280> it's

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
very good for us desire it's like it's

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.100 
very good for us desire it's like it's
like<00:01:23.670> junk<00:01:24.000> food<00:01:24.060> basically<00:01:24.600> there<00:01:24.960> was<00:01:25.080> a

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
like junk food basically there was a

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.440 
like junk food basically there was a
really<00:01:25.409> fascinating<00:01:25.619> study<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.580> had

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
really fascinating study that had

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.260 
really fascinating study that had
college<00:01:28.320> students<00:01:28.799> sit<00:01:29.070> alone<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.880> room<00:01:30.030> for

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
college students sit alone in a room for

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.300 
college students sit alone in a room for
20<00:01:30.570> minutes<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.079> their<00:01:31.259> phones<00:01:31.590> were<00:01:32.009> taken

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
20 minutes and their phones were taken

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.130 
20 minutes and their phones were taken
away<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.790> they<00:01:33.270> couldn't<00:01:33.570> do<00:01:33.659> anything<00:01:33.689> there

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
away and they couldn't do anything there

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.600 
away and they couldn't do anything there
weren't<00:01:34.350> any<00:01:34.470> books<00:01:34.740> there<00:01:35.070> was<00:01:35.189> nothing<00:01:35.490> like

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
weren't any books there was nothing like

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.870 
weren't any books there was nothing like
that

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
that

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.020 
that
and<00:01:36.390> they<00:01:36.930> just<00:01:37.110> had<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.350> sit<00:01:37.530> there<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.030> they

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
and they just had to sit there and they

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.420 
and they just had to sit there and they
were<00:01:39.869> miserable<00:01:40.049> they<00:01:40.740> just<00:01:41.009> couldn't<00:01:41.189> do<00:01:41.400> it

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
were miserable they just couldn't do it

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.359 
were miserable they just couldn't do it
they<00:01:41.610> wanted<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.000> get<00:01:42.119> out<00:01:42.299> of<00:01:42.479> there<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:42.869> then

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
they wanted to get out of there and then

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.679 
they wanted to get out of there and then
afterwards<00:01:44.369> when<00:01:44.700> they<00:01:44.850> were<00:01:44.909> asked<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.509> say

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
afterwards when they were asked to say

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.240 
afterwards when they were asked to say
you<00:01:45.750> know<00:01:45.960> would<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.200> rather<00:01:46.439> do<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:46.890> again

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
you know would you rather do this again

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.789 
you know would you rather do this again
we<00:01:47.700> get<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.909> series<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.299> electric<00:01:48.810> shocks<00:01:49.049> most

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
we get a series of electric shocks most

of them said I want electric shocks I
actually<00:01:52.229> want<00:01:52.710> something<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.340> I'd<00:01:53.460> done<00:01:53.490> to

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
actually want something that I'd done to

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.660 
actually want something that I'd done to
me<00:01:54.090> rather<00:01:54.750> than<00:01:54.960> having<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.560> sit<00:01:55.799> in<00:01:55.950> in<00:01:56.520> a

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
me rather than having to sit in in a

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.520 
me rather than having to sit in in a
room<00:01:56.880> with<00:01:57.030> my<00:01:57.180> own<00:01:57.329> thoughts<00:01:57.659> because<00:01:57.990> we've

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
room with my own thoughts because we've

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.230 
room with my own thoughts because we've
really<00:01:58.890> gotten<00:01:59.219> out<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.579> habit<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.939> doing

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
really gotten out of the habit of doing

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.030 
really gotten out of the habit of doing
that<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.630> don't<00:02:01.020> think<00:02:01.229> we<00:02:01.380> need<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.649> be<00:02:01.860> afraid

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
that I don't think we need to be afraid

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.039 
that I don't think we need to be afraid
of<00:02:02.159> Technology<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:03.210> think<00:02:03.630> we<00:02:03.750> should<00:02:03.960> embrace

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
of Technology I think we should embrace

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.210 
of Technology I think we should embrace
it

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
it

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.670 
it
we<00:02:05.490> really<00:02:05.910> need<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.240> be<00:02:06.360> aware<00:02:06.510> of<00:02:07.020> what<00:02:07.560> it

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
we really need to be aware of what it

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.010 
we really need to be aware of what it
can<00:02:07.920> do<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.430> in<00:02:08.910> that<00:02:09.150> way<00:02:09.360> we<00:02:09.540> can<00:02:09.720> try<00:02:09.960> to

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
can do and in that way we can try to

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.240 
can do and in that way we can try to
kind<00:02:10.320> of<00:02:10.350> embrace<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.890> good<00:02:11.070> about

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
kind of embrace the good about

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.370 
kind of embrace the good about
technology<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.180> yet<00:02:12.630> try<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:12.960> keep<00:02:13.230> our

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
technology and yet try to keep our

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.500 
technology and yet try to keep our
brains<00:02:13.530> developing<00:02:14.340> in<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.520> direction<00:02:14.970> we
