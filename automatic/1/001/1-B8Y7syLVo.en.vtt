00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
all the same length and I do probably

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.880 
all the same length and I do probably
recommend<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:26.140> shorter<00:01:26.439> ones<00:01:26.590> and<00:01:26.829> the

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890

recommend the the shorter ones and the
longer<00:01:27.159> ones<00:01:27.310> because<00:01:27.579> that<00:01:27.909> way<00:01:28.060> you<00:01:28.090> can

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
longer ones because that way you can

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.510 
longer ones because that way you can
make<00:01:29.170> it<00:01:29.289> even<00:01:29.439> more<00:01:29.590> natural<00:01:30.070> lack<00:01:30.219> by

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
make it even more natural lack by

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.969 
make it even more natural lack by
applying<00:01:30.820> the<00:01:31.000> shorter<00:01:31.299> ones<00:01:31.530> niti<00:01:32.530> duct<00:01:32.860> and

tiny<00:03:50.900> small<00:03:51.350> band<00:03:51.650> it<00:03:52.040> basically<00:03:52.970> stops<00:03:53.600> any

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
tiny small band it basically stops any

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.870 
tiny small band it basically stops any
glue<00:03:54.290> or<00:03:54.320> any<00:03:54.680> texture<00:03:55.310> coming<00:03:55.579> through<00:03:55.760> and

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
glue or any texture coming through and

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.009 
glue or any texture coming through and
just<00:03:55.940> makes<00:03:56.269> your<00:03:56.390> eyes<00:03:56.540> look<00:03:56.570> a<00:03:56.840> lot<00:03:56.959> more

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
just makes your eyes look a lot more

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.660 
just makes your eyes look a lot more
natural<00:03:57.530> and<00:03:57.650> it<00:03:58.070> will<00:03:58.220> make<00:03:58.400> your<00:03:58.519> lashes

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
natural and it will make your lashes

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.610 
natural and it will make your lashes
appear<00:03:59.150> a<00:03:59.180> lot<00:03:59.329> thicker<00:03:59.570> and<00:03:59.840> a<00:03:59.930> lot<00:04:00.049> fuller<00:04:00.350> as

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
appear a lot thicker and a lot fuller as

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.800 
appear a lot thicker and a lot fuller as
well<00:04:00.860> so<00:04:01.459> now<00:04:01.970> I'm<00:04:02.090> just<00:04:02.180> going<00:04:02.360> to<00:04:02.390> go<00:04:02.480> in<00:04:02.510> with

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
well so now I'm just going to go in with

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.569 
well so now I'm just going to go in with
mascara<00:04:03.200> can<00:04:03.500> use<00:04:03.620> whatever<00:04:03.799> mascara<00:04:04.400> you

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
mascara can use whatever mascara you

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:08.140 
mascara can use whatever mascara you
like<00:04:04.850> I<00:04:05.620> personally<00:04:06.620> prefer<00:04:07.040> to<00:04:07.640> do<00:04:07.790> mascara

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
like I personally prefer to do mascara

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.640 
like I personally prefer to do mascara
after<00:04:08.630> the<00:04:08.750> lashes<00:04:09.110> have<00:04:09.260> been<00:04:09.410> applied

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
after the lashes have been applied

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.470 
after the lashes have been applied
because<00:04:10.310> it<00:04:10.489> just<00:04:10.610> makes<00:04:10.820> it<00:04:11.030> so<00:04:11.090> much<00:04:11.299> more

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
because it just makes it so much more

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.380 
because it just makes it so much more
easier<00:04:12.170> you<00:04:12.739> don't<00:04:12.769> have<00:04:13.190> you<00:04:13.519> know<00:04:13.640> thick

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
easier you don't have you know thick

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.479 
easier you don't have you know thick
mascara<00:04:15.049> credit<00:04:15.650> lashes<00:04:16.010> in<00:04:16.190> your<00:04:16.340> way<00:04:16.459> when

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
mascara credit lashes in your way when

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.569 
mascara credit lashes in your way when
you're<00:04:16.760> trying<00:04:17.000> to<00:04:17.120> apply<00:04:17.479> the<00:04:18.579> individual

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
you're trying to apply the individual

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.039 
you're trying to apply the individual
lashes<00:04:19.760> because<00:04:19.970> it<00:04:20.180> can<00:04:20.299> be<00:04:20.419> quite<00:04:20.570> fiddly<00:04:20.870> I

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
lashes because it can be quite fiddly I

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.780 
lashes because it can be quite fiddly I
just<00:04:21.320> find<00:04:21.500> this<00:04:21.590> a<00:04:21.739> lot<00:04:21.890> easier<00:04:22.040> now<00:04:22.430> because

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
just find this a lot easier now because

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.880 
just find this a lot easier now because
the<00:04:23.540> individual<00:04:24.050> lashes<00:04:24.260> are<00:04:24.530> a<00:04:24.590> lot<00:04:24.860> more

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
the individual lashes are a lot more

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.920 
the individual lashes are a lot more
delicate<00:04:25.550> compared<00:04:26.090> to<00:04:26.210> a<00:04:26.240> full<00:04:26.630> set<00:04:26.810> of

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
delicate compared to a full set of

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.540 
delicate compared to a full set of
lashes<00:04:27.290> you<00:04:27.410> need<00:04:27.560> to<00:04:27.650> be<00:04:27.740> very<00:04:27.979> careful<00:04:28.250> when

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
lashes you need to be very careful when

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.820 
lashes you need to be very careful when
you<00:04:28.669> apply<00:04:28.970> a<00:04:29.000> mascara<00:04:29.210> so<00:04:30.050> I'd<00:04:30.260> like<00:04:30.470> to<00:04:30.680> just

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
you apply a mascara so I'd like to just

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.860 
you apply a mascara so I'd like to just
gently<00:04:31.100> kind<00:04:31.430> of<00:04:31.520> almost<00:04:31.700> Pat<00:04:32.090> the<00:04:32.270> mascara<00:04:32.690> or

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
gently kind of almost Pat the mascara or

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.810 
gently kind of almost Pat the mascara or
focus<00:04:33.200> towards<00:04:33.500> the<00:04:33.590> ends<00:04:33.950> so<00:04:34.130> it<00:04:34.430> just<00:04:34.610> helps

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
focus towards the ends so it just helps

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.279 
focus towards the ends so it just helps
to<00:04:34.880> bond<00:04:35.180> it<00:04:35.330> together<00:04:35.450> and<00:04:35.840> make<00:04:36.020> it

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:36.289 
to bond it together and make it

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:39.040 
to bond it together and make it
more<00:04:36.499> natural<00:04:36.919> so<00:04:37.789> you<00:04:38.300> can<00:04:38.569> curl<00:04:38.869> your<00:04:38.990> lashes

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
more natural so you can curl your lashes

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.579 
more natural so you can curl your lashes
if<00:04:39.469> you<00:04:39.649> like<00:04:39.919> I<00:04:40.159> don't<00:04:40.749> recommend<00:04:41.749> doing<00:04:42.289> it

00:04:42.579 --> 00:04:42.589 
if you like I don't recommend doing it

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:44.139 
if you like I don't recommend doing it
with<00:04:42.770> their<00:04:42.979> individual<00:04:43.580> lashes<00:04:43.759> just

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:44.149 
with their individual lashes just

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:45.369 
with their individual lashes just
because<00:04:44.419> as<00:04:44.599> I<00:04:44.719> said<00:04:44.899> they<00:04:45.050> are<00:04:45.199> quite

00:04:45.369 --> 00:04:45.379 
because as I said they are quite

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:47.139 
because as I said they are quite
delicate<00:04:45.649> and<00:04:46.069> you<00:04:46.129> don't<00:04:46.399> want<00:04:46.580> to<00:04:46.669> disturb

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:47.149 
delicate and you don't want to disturb

00:04:47.149 --> 00:04:48.730 
delicate and you don't want to disturb
them<00:04:47.389> especially<00:04:47.659> because<00:04:48.050> they<00:04:48.169> are<00:04:48.319> fiddly

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
them especially because they are fiddly

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.829 
them especially because they are fiddly
to<00:04:48.770> put<00:04:49.129> on<00:04:49.249> so<00:04:49.819> if<00:04:49.939> you<00:04:50.059> do<00:04:50.240> want<00:04:50.270> to<00:04:50.509> curl<00:04:50.719> your

00:04:50.829 --> 00:04:50.839 
to put on so if you do want to curl your

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:52.209 
to put on so if you do want to curl your
lashes<00:04:50.899> I<00:04:51.289> recommend<00:04:51.649> just<00:04:51.800> killing<00:04:52.099> your

00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:52.219 
lashes I recommend just killing your

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:54.850 
lashes I recommend just killing your
natural<00:04:52.520> lashes<00:04:52.639> before<00:04:52.999> you<00:04:53.270> apply<00:04:53.539> them<00:04:53.860> and

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
natural lashes before you apply them and

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.950 
natural lashes before you apply them and
then<00:04:55.339> go<00:04:55.490> in<00:04:55.669> with<00:04:56.270> the<00:04:56.419> fall<00:04:56.569> fashion<00:04:56.869> because

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
then go in with the fall fashion because

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.299 
then go in with the fall fashion because
they<00:04:57.199> are<00:04:57.319> quite<00:04:57.499> clearly<00:04:57.800> on<00:04:58.009> their<00:04:58.159> own<00:04:58.279> you

00:04:58.299 --> 00:04:58.309 
they are quite clearly on their own you

00:04:58.309 --> 00:05:00.100 
they are quite clearly on their own you
probably<00:04:58.879> won't<00:04:59.089> even<00:04:59.210> need<00:04:59.449> to<00:04:59.629> call<00:04:59.839> them<00:04:59.990> I

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
probably won't even need to call them I

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.320 
probably won't even need to call them I
haven't<00:05:00.409> called<00:05:00.559> these<00:05:00.770> and<00:05:01.129> I<00:05:01.279> really<00:05:02.119> am
