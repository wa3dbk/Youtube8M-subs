00:01:37.379 --> 00:01:37.389 
the virus under their microscopes so in

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:39.539 
the virus under their microscopes so in
some<00:01:37.630> cases<00:01:37.869> it<00:01:38.380> seems<00:01:38.709> a<00:01:38.829> little<00:01:39.009> bit<00:01:39.249> weird

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
some cases it seems a little bit weird

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.999 
some cases it seems a little bit weird
because<00:01:39.959> we<00:01:40.959> are<00:01:41.079> in<00:01:41.319> the<00:01:41.409> 70s<00:01:41.859> 80s<00:01:42.639> we<00:01:43.329> are<00:01:43.479> in

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
because we are in the 70s 80s we are in

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.949 
because we are in the 70s 80s we are in
deep<00:01:45.009> deep<00:01:45.310> Africa<00:01:45.969> and<00:01:46.329> some<00:01:46.630> hidden

00:01:46.949 --> 00:01:46.959 
deep deep Africa and some hidden

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:49.199 
deep deep Africa and some hidden
villages<00:01:47.469> where<00:01:48.009> there's<00:01:48.369> no<00:01:48.729> communication

00:01:49.199 --> 00:01:49.209 
villages where there's no communication

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:55.489 
villages where there's no communication
and<00:01:49.810> they<00:01:50.529> also<00:01:50.709> are<00:01:50.950> really<00:01:52.590> at<00:01:53.590> times<00:01:54.149> he

00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:55.499 
and they also are really at times he

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:57.839 
and they also are really at times he
discovered<00:01:56.499> a<00:01:56.590> lot<00:01:56.770> about<00:01:57.009> those<00:01:57.219> people<00:01:57.459> like

00:01:57.839 --> 00:01:57.849 
discovered a lot about those people like

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:00.319 
discovered a lot about those people like
what<00:01:58.090> they<00:01:58.119> did<00:01:58.509> on<00:01:58.539> on<00:01:59.049> their<00:01:59.289> last<00:01:59.499> days<00:01:59.799> and

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
what they did on on their last days and

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.629 
what they did on on their last days and
where<00:02:01.329> they<00:02:01.659> catch<00:02:01.990> it<00:02:02.289> and<00:02:02.619> it's<00:02:02.979> just<00:02:03.219> it

00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:03.639 
where they catch it and it's just it

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:06.239 
where they catch it and it's just it
seems<00:02:03.909> a<00:02:03.999> little<00:02:04.149> bit<00:02:04.419> much<00:02:04.689> like<00:02:05.020> some<00:02:05.649> things

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:06.249 
seems a little bit much like some things

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:09.449 
seems a little bit much like some things
he<00:02:06.520> just<00:02:06.729> couldn't<00:02:07.359> know<00:02:07.719> I<00:02:07.990> think<00:02:08.069> but<00:02:09.069> in

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
he just couldn't know I think but in

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.690 
he just couldn't know I think but in
other<00:02:09.700> cases<00:02:10.000> he<00:02:10.690> really<00:02:11.260> tells<00:02:11.530> so<00:02:11.890> yeah

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
other cases he really tells so yeah

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.759 
other cases he really tells so yeah
that's<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.120> story<00:02:13.390> and<00:02:13.690> then<00:02:13.900> there<00:02:14.560> might<00:02:14.709> be

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
that's the story and then there might be

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:18.059 
that's the story and then there might be
this<00:02:15.280> way<00:02:15.579> the<00:02:15.909> person<00:02:16.870> got<00:02:17.110> this<00:02:17.319> virus<00:02:17.829> or

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
this way the person got this virus or

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:19.320 
this way the person got this virus or
this<00:02:18.310> way<00:02:18.519> and

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
this way and

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.210 
this way and
he<00:02:19.600> then<00:02:19.840> just<00:02:20.140> talks<00:02:20.530> about<00:02:20.620> their<00:02:21.010> whole

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220

infect other people on their journey to
seeking<00:02:40.840> health<00:02:41.110> at<00:02:41.560> that<00:02:42.100> time<00:02:42.400> and<00:02:43.210> when<00:02:43.360> the

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
seeking health at that time and when the

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.200 
seeking health at that time and when the
book<00:02:43.630> came<00:02:43.780> out<00:02:43.960> they<00:02:44.950> didn't<00:02:45.400> really<00:02:45.580> knew

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
book came out they didn't really knew

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.540 
book came out they didn't really knew
what<00:02:47.080> caused<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:48.130> Ebola<00:02:49.060> virus<00:02:49.090> or<00:02:49.690> which

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
what caused the Ebola virus or which

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:56.370 
what caused the Ebola virus or which
like<00:02:51.550> animals<00:02:52.330> where<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:54.750> you<00:02:55.750> know<00:02:55.780> who<00:02:56.200> had

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
like animals where the you know who had

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.350 
like animals where the you know who had
the<00:02:56.590> virus<00:02:56.800> in<00:02:57.130> them<00:02:57.310> and<00:02:57.580> infected<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.210> other

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
the virus in them and infected the other

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.250 
the virus in them and infected the other
animals<00:02:58.870> all<00:02:59.200> the<00:02:59.680> people<00:03:00.420> so<00:03:01.420> I<00:03:01.780> think

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
animals all the people so I think

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.810 
animals all the people so I think
nowadays<00:03:02.860> it's<00:03:03.610> quite<00:03:04.030> clear<00:03:04.450> that<00:03:04.620> bats<00:03:05.820> hold

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
nowadays it's quite clear that bats hold

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.600 
nowadays it's quite clear that bats hold
the<00:03:07.150> virus<00:03:07.660> but<00:03:08.260> virus<00:03:08.740> isn't<00:03:08.950> killing<00:03:09.400> them

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
the virus but virus isn't killing them

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.870 
the virus but virus isn't killing them
so<00:03:10.320> they<00:03:11.320> go<00:03:11.710> on<00:03:11.860> and<00:03:12.100> in<00:03:12.220> fact<00:03:12.250> and<00:03:12.730> in<00:03:12.850> fact

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
so they go on and in fact and in fact

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.390 
so they go on and in fact and in fact
and<00:03:13.210> in<00:03:13.390> fact<00:03:13.420> like<00:03:14.140> monkeys<00:03:14.620> and<00:03:14.950> everyone

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
and in fact like monkeys and everyone

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.540 
and in fact like monkeys and everyone
and<00:03:15.820> then<00:03:16.180> the<00:03:16.390> monkeys<00:03:16.810> infect<00:03:17.260> humans<00:03:17.860> what

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
and then the monkeys infect humans what

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.550 
and then the monkeys infect humans what
I<00:03:18.580> absolutely<00:03:18.970> loved<00:03:19.660> about<00:03:19.930> this<00:03:20.110> book<00:03:20.410> and

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
in this book and also about the labs all

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.400 
in this book and also about the labs all
around<00:04:26.260> the<00:04:26.620> world

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
around the world

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.670 
around the world
who<00:04:27.700> specialized<00:04:28.700> in<00:04:29.000> those<00:04:29.360> viruses<00:04:30.140> how

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
who specialized in those viruses how

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
who specialized in those viruses how
dangerous<00:04:31.250> it<00:04:31.610> really<00:04:32.090> is<00:04:32.270> because<00:04:32.900> still

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
dangerous it really is because still

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.280 
dangerous it really is because still
those<00:04:34.700> labs<00:04:34.940> they<00:04:35.390> are<00:04:35.450> super<00:04:35.840> specialized

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
those labs they are super specialized

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.550 
those labs they are super specialized
but<00:04:37.060> it's<00:04:38.060> so<00:04:38.720> dangerous<00:04:39.200> for<00:04:39.410> them

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
but it's so dangerous for them

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.490 
but it's so dangerous for them
to<00:04:39.590> work<00:04:40.460> with<00:04:40.670> with<00:04:41.030> those<00:04:41.210> things<00:04:41.510> even<00:04:42.380> if

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
to work with with those things even if

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.280 
to work with with those things even if
they<00:04:42.620> have<00:04:42.770> all<00:04:42.980> those<00:04:43.190> suits<00:04:43.550> and<00:04:43.990> it's<00:04:44.990> still

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
they have all those suits and it's still

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.200 
they have all those suits and it's still
you<00:04:45.470> only<00:04:45.530> have<00:04:46.040> to<00:04:46.190> pick<00:04:46.430> yourself<00:04:46.610> with<00:04:47.090> the

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
you only have to pick yourself with the

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.170 
you only have to pick yourself with the
needle<00:04:47.540> once<00:04:47.750> and<00:04:48.080> then<00:04:48.350> you<00:04:49.220> have<00:04:49.490> this<00:04:49.670> virus

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
needle once and then you have this virus

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
needle once and then you have this virus
and<00:04:50.480> it's<00:04:50.900> just<00:04:51.280> not<00:04:52.280> the<00:04:52.550> most<00:04:53.210> interesting

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
and it's just not the most interesting

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.620 
and it's just not the most interesting
thing<00:04:54.440> for<00:04:54.470> me<00:04:54.800> was<00:04:54.980> to<00:04:55.310> learn<00:04:56.060> about<00:04:56.270> how<00:04:56.600> a

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
thing for me was to learn about how a

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.610 
thing for me was to learn about how a
virus<00:04:57.190> develops<00:04:58.190> in<00:04:58.610> different<00:04:59.240> strains<00:04:59.750> so

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
virus develops in different strains so

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.740 
virus develops in different strains so
for<00:05:00.890> example<00:05:01.340> at<00:05:01.550> tangulls<00:05:02.060> book<00:05:02.210> came<00:05:02.390> out<00:05:02.540> in

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
for example at tangulls book came out in

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.070 
for example at tangulls book came out in
1993<00:05:03.320> there<00:05:04.130> were<00:05:04.280> four<00:05:04.670> strains<00:05:05.210> of<00:05:05.480> the

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
1993 there were four strains of the

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.640 
1993 there were four strains of the
Ebola<00:05:06.800> virus<00:05:07.060> the<00:05:08.060> first<00:05:08.300> one<00:05:08.480> was<00:05:08.690> marble<00:05:09.320> it

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
Ebola virus the first one was marble it

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.800 
Ebola virus the first one was marble it
was<00:05:09.860> a<00:05:09.890> strain<00:05:10.250> discovered<00:05:10.790> in<00:05:10.970> my<00:05:11.180> work<00:05:11.510> in

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
was a strain discovered in my work in

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.850 
was a strain discovered in my work in
Germany<00:05:12.370> then<00:05:13.370> there<00:05:13.640> is<00:05:13.820> the<00:05:14.090> Ebola<00:05:14.860> Sudan

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
Germany then there is the Ebola Sudan

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.770 
Germany then there is the Ebola Sudan
and<00:05:16.190> the<00:05:17.060> Ebola<00:05:17.900> idea<00:05:18.530> I<00:05:19.270> don't<00:05:20.270> really<00:05:20.480> know

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
and the Ebola idea I don't really know

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.980 
and the Ebola idea I don't really know
how<00:05:20.990> to<00:05:21.050> pronounce<00:05:21.890> those<00:05:22.540> African<00:05:23.540> countries

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
how to pronounce those African countries

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.070 
how to pronounce those African countries
in<00:05:24.830> the<00:05:25.070> English<00:05:25.460> name<00:05:25.700> and<00:05:25.970> there's<00:05:26.420> also<00:05:26.690> a

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
in the English name and there's also a

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.400 
in the English name and there's also a
bola<00:05:27.320> Reston<00:05:27.920> and<00:05:28.480> that<00:05:29.480> one<00:05:29.720> it<00:05:30.230> was

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
bola Reston and that one it was

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:35.050 
bola Reston and that one it was
discovered<00:05:30.860> I<00:05:31.340> think<00:05:31.970> in<00:05:32.090> the<00:05:32.210> 80s<00:05:32.980> in<00:05:34.060> Reston

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
discovered I think in the 80s in Reston

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.200 
discovered I think in the 80s in Reston
in<00:05:35.390> the<00:05:35.570> United<00:05:35.990> States<00:05:36.320> and<00:05:36.680> this<00:05:37.220> strain<00:05:38.180> of

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
in the United States and this strain of

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.909 
in the United States and this strain of
Ebola<00:05:39.050> virus<00:05:39.940> spreads<00:05:40.940> really<00:05:41.240> fast<00:05:41.720> but<00:05:42.710> it's

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:42.919 
Ebola virus spreads really fast but it's

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:45.430 
Ebola virus spreads really fast but it's
the<00:05:43.070> only<00:05:43.220> one<00:05:43.430> that<00:05:43.490> doesn't<00:05:43.850> jump<00:05:44.419> to<00:05:44.960> humans

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
the only one that doesn't jump to humans

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.920 
the only one that doesn't jump to humans
so<00:05:45.770> it<00:05:46.310> stays<00:05:46.669> with<00:05:47.000> the<00:05:47.180> monkeys<00:05:47.540> for<00:05:47.780> the

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
so it stays with the monkeys for the

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.320 
so it stays with the monkeys for the
animals<00:05:48.320> and<00:05:48.770> I<00:05:49.340> don't<00:05:49.460> know<00:05:49.669> I<00:05:49.730> just<00:05:49.820> find<00:05:50.150> it

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
animals and I don't know I just find it

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:55.570 
animals and I don't know I just find it
super<00:05:50.540> interesting<00:05:51.320> the<00:05:52.220> biological<00:05:54.580> science

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
super interesting the biological science

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.770 
super interesting the biological science
yeah<00:05:57.550> so<00:05:58.550> I<00:05:58.760> would<00:05:58.940> recommend<00:05:59.390> this<00:05:59.510> book<00:05:59.720> for

00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.780 
yeah so I would recommend this book for

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.480 
yeah so I would recommend this book for
everyone<00:06:00.230> who<00:06:00.560> is<00:06:00.590> interested<00:06:00.950> and

nonfiction<00:06:01.880> that<00:06:02.150> reads<00:06:02.600> like<00:06:02.810> fiction<00:06:03.140> so

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:04.100 
nonfiction that reads like fiction so

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.850 
nonfiction that reads like fiction so
that's<00:06:04.340> a<00:06:04.460> real<00:06:04.700> page-turner<00:06:05.530> for<00:06:06.530> people

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:06.860 
that's a real page-turner for people

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.900 
that's a real page-turner for people
interested<00:06:07.640> in<00:06:07.700> biological<00:06:08.030> things<00:06:08.810> and

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:09.910 
interested in biological things and

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.630 
interested in biological things and
viruses<00:06:10.910> and<00:06:11.300> just<00:06:11.720> people<00:06:12.350> want<00:06:12.710> to<00:06:12.830> learn

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:13.640 
viruses and just people want to learn

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.030 
viruses and just people want to learn
something<00:06:14.240> while<00:06:14.390> they<00:06:14.630> read<00:06:14.990> there's<00:06:15.590> also<00:06:15.860> a

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:16.040 
something while they read there's also a

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.900 
something while they read there's also a
similar<00:06:16.550> book<00:06:16.700> called<00:06:17.090> the<00:06:17.419> coming<00:06:17.750> plague<00:06:18.290> I

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:18.910 
similar book called the coming plague I

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.180 
similar book called the coming plague I
just<00:06:19.910> forget<00:06:20.270> who<00:06:20.990> wrote<00:06:21.290> it<00:06:21.500> I<00:06:21.680> think<00:06:21.919> a<00:06:22.040> woman

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.190 
just forget who wrote it I think a woman

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.700 
just forget who wrote it I think a woman
this<00:06:22.700> is<00:06:22.850> a<00:06:22.880> book<00:06:23.419> about<00:06:23.600> different<00:06:24.260> viruses

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:24.710 
this is a book about different viruses

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.170 
this is a book about different viruses
and<00:06:24.890> diseases<00:06:25.280> and<00:06:25.730> just<00:06:26.150> everything<00:06:26.680> about

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:28.180 
and diseases and just everything about

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.290 
and diseases and just everything about
HIV<00:06:29.180> and<00:06:29.480> cholera<00:06:29.960> and<00:06:30.580> Ebola<00:06:31.580> and<00:06:31.880> it<00:06:32.090> seems

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:32.300 
HIV and cholera and Ebola and it seems

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.980 
HIV and cholera and Ebola and it seems
like<00:06:32.510> a<00:06:32.540> huge<00:06:33.970> encyclopedia<00:06:34.970> kind<00:06:35.539> of<00:06:35.720> book

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:35.990 
like a huge encyclopedia kind of book

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.790 
like a huge encyclopedia kind of book
it's<00:06:36.320> over<00:06:36.979> 700<00:06:37.550> pages<00:06:38.080> big

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800 
it's over 700 pages big

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.119 
it's over 700 pages big
and<00:06:40.090> this<00:06:41.090> book<00:06:41.330> seems<00:06:41.569> to<00:06:41.690> be<00:06:41.780> better<00:06:42.770> written

00:06:43.119 --> 00:06:43.129 
and this book seems to be better written

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:47.710 
and this book seems to be better written
than<00:06:43.690> this<00:06:44.690> book<00:06:44.990> the<00:06:45.259> hot<00:06:45.440> zone<00:06:45.470> but<00:06:46.720> yeah

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:47.720 
than this book the hot zone but yeah

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.740 
than this book the hot zone but yeah
still<00:06:48.590> whatever<00:06:49.490> interests<00:06:50.360> you<00:06:50.419> I<00:06:50.690> think

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:50.750 
still whatever interests you I think

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.439 
still whatever interests you I think
they<00:06:51.050> are<00:06:51.229> both<00:06:51.500> great<00:06:51.830> and<00:06:52.069> probably<00:06:52.849> well

00:06:53.439 --> 00:06:53.449 
they are both great and probably well

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:55.089 
they are both great and probably well
look<00:06:53.659> into<00:06:53.900> the<00:06:54.020> other<00:06:54.169> one<00:06:54.349> as<00:06:54.470> well<00:06:54.710> the

00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:55.099 
look into the other one as well the

00:06:55.099 --> 00:06:57.040 
look into the other one as well the
Richard<00:06:55.430> Preston<00:06:55.610> also<00:06:56.360> wrote<00:06:56.569> another<00:06:56.930> book

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.050 
Richard Preston also wrote another book

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:00.309 
Richard Preston also wrote another book
called<00:06:57.550> demin<00:06:58.550> in<00:06:58.729> the<00:06:58.879> freezer<00:06:59.240> about<00:06:59.870> the

called demin in the freezer about the

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:04.490 
biological weapon and tracks and this is
