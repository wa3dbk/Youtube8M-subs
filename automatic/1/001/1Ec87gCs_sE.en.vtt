about one o'clock after having quite a
few<00:00:11.429> drinks<00:00:11.580> I<00:00:11.759> was<00:00:11.790> like<00:00:12.000> oh<00:00:12.120> no<00:00:12.420> I<00:00:12.450> need<00:00:12.690> to

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.799 
few drinks I was like oh no I need to
play<00:00:12.990> so<00:00:13.280> warning<00:00:14.280> in<00:00:14.400> advance<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:15.150> games<00:00:15.389> are

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
play so warning in advance the games are

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.179 
play so warning in advance the games are
too<00:00:16.650> great<00:00:17.039> but<00:00:17.609> um<00:00:18.000> we<00:00:18.990> went<00:00:19.619> showing<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:20.039> go

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
too great but um we went showing to go

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.220 
too great but um we went showing to go
in<00:00:20.250> there<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.490> some<00:00:21.000> reason<00:00:21.480> he<00:00:21.720> decided<00:00:21.779> to

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
in there and some reason he decided to

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.140 
in there and some reason he decided to
quit<00:00:22.529> i'm<00:00:22.650> guessing<00:00:22.949> because<00:00:23.039> my<00:00:23.369> team<00:00:23.609> was

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
quit i'm guessing because my team was

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.340 
quit i'm guessing because my team was
better<00:00:24.300> than<00:00:24.510> his<00:00:24.570> but<00:00:24.750> we<00:00:24.869> came<00:00:24.990> up<00:00:25.050> against

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
better than his but we came up against

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.500 
better than his but we came up against
this<00:00:25.500> guy<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:25.830> he<00:00:25.890> wanted<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.279> play<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.760> we

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
this guy and he wanted to play and we

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.080 
this guy and he wanted to play and we
went<00:00:27.689> straight<00:00:27.840> in<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.380> after<00:00:29.189> about<00:00:29.820> 10

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
went straight in and after about 10

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.609 
went straight in and after about 10
seconds<00:00:30.390> me<00:00:30.539> waiting<00:00:30.810> any<00:00:30.869> had<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.140> pretty

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
seconds me waiting any had a pretty

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.040 
seconds me waiting any had a pretty
average<00:00:31.890> team<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.369> couple<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.759> Pacey<00:00:33.050> English

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
average team a couple of Pacey English

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.209 
average team a couple of Pacey English
players<00:00:34.320> in<00:00:34.530> there<00:00:34.680> but<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:34.920> was<00:00:35.040> all<00:00:35.130> about

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
players in there but it was all about

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.860 
players in there but it was all about
his<00:00:35.399> chemistry<00:00:35.790> really<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.510> wasn't<00:00:36.780> long

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
his chemistry really and it wasn't long

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.720 
his chemistry really and it wasn't long
before<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.260> managed<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.649> take<00:00:38.309> around<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.610> keep

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
before I managed to take around the keep

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.780 
before I managed to take around the keep
and<00:00:38.879> get<00:00:39.090> fouled<00:00:39.329> for<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.930> penalty<00:00:40.379> which<00:00:40.890> as

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
and get fouled for a penalty which as

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.150 
and get fouled for a penalty which as
you'll<00:00:42.180> see<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.510> second<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.620> goalie<00:00:43.860> stayed

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
you'll see in a second the goalie stayed

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.400 
you'll see in a second the goalie stayed
to<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.399> left<00:00:44.610> for<00:00:44.910> some<00:00:45.149> reason<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.660> didn't

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
to the left for some reason and didn't

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.319 
to the left for some reason and didn't
even<00:00:46.440> dive<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.579> allowed<00:00:47.820> me<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.149> just

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
even dive and that allowed me to just

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.940 
even dive and that allowed me to just
put<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.600> into<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.809> back<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.289> with<00:00:49.469> ease<00:00:49.680> to

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
put it into the back of it with ease to

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.950 
put it into the back of it with ease to
make<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.370> one<00:00:50.760> nil<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.719> was<00:00:51.840> how<00:00:51.930> it

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
make it one nil and that was how it

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.750 
make it one nil and that was how it
stayed<00:00:52.350> at<00:00:52.559> halftime<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:53.250> wasn't<00:00:53.730> very

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
stayed at halftime I wasn't very

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.729 
stayed at halftime I wasn't very
attacking<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.570> was<00:00:54.780> really<00:00:54.989> defensive<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:55.530> just

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
attacking I was really defensive I just

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.799 
attacking I was really defensive I just
didn't<00:00:56.039> want<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.460> concede<00:00:57.120> but<00:00:57.300> then<00:00:57.570> on<00:00:57.719> the

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
didn't want to concede but then on the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.750 
didn't want to concede but then on the
60th<00:00:58.230> minute<00:00:58.320> he<00:00:58.949> ran<00:00:59.160> down<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.460> wing<00:00:59.609> my

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
60th minute he ran down the wing my

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.279 
60th minute he ran down the wing my
defense<00:01:00.090> was<00:01:00.149> terrible<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.719> he<00:01:00.809> went<00:01:01.050> in<00:01:01.140> for

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
defense was terrible and he went in for

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.080 
defense was terrible and he went in for
a<00:01:01.379> flying<00:01:01.710> diving<00:01:02.190> header<00:01:02.399> slid<00:01:02.760> across<00:01:02.879> the

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
a flying diving header slid across the

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.359 
a flying diving header slid across the
floor<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.629> put<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.710> back<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:05.070> net<00:01:05.220> but

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
floor and put it in the back of net but

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.130 
floor and put it in the back of net but
then<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:05.760> got<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:05.970> bit<00:01:06.150> lucky<00:01:06.479> with<00:01:06.600> my<00:01:06.689> free<00:01:06.930> ball

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
then I got a bit lucky with my free ball

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.690 
then I got a bit lucky with my free ball
his<00:01:07.290> players<00:01:07.530> run<00:01:07.740> into<00:01:08.010> each<00:01:08.130> other<00:01:08.280> i<00:01:08.430> took

his players run into each other i took

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.490 
his players run into each other i took
it<00:01:08.729> round<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.119> player<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.600> finesse<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.350> into

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
the back of the net to make it 2-1

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
literally two minutes after he scored

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.390 
literally two minutes after he scored
but<00:01:14.790> then<00:01:15.229> some<00:01:16.229> terrible<00:01:16.590> decision<00:01:17.040> making

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
but then some terrible decision making
