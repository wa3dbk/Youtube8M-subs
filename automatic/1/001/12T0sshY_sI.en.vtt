00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.370
 hello dear audience and sincerely 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.279
 welcome 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.750
 I explain to them today as they do 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.630
 photo project with simple 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.670
 budgetary resources 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.170
 I've planned two motives for this 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.720
 First, they only need one 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.340
 pack drinking straws and for the second 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.430
 motivational it would be helpful 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.320
 double-sided adhesive tape and one 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.100
 glass plate or a piece of plexiglas too 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.989
 to have 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.510
 in addition to straws need 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.940
 Of course there is still a camera in there 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.410
 It does not matter which model you use 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.539
 she should only have one 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.090
 manual focus, they have the 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.920
 closing time the aperture and the iso 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.440
 determine value manually stay alive 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.539
 Photo projects like this one are worth it 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.949
 to act in addition to the exposure 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.289
 to focus manually 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.440
 Set infocus point perfectly 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.359
 In addition, the camera should be on a 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.000
 be mounted tripod and the 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.000
 Camera internal timer function activated 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.430
 be to avoid blurring in picture 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.680
 so the first motive is relatively simple 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.689
 I would this box here with the 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.090
 straws right here from the window 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.619
 position 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.770
 the whole gives a nice light of 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.290
 Hands and you recognize the whole 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.140
 cross sections or the diameter 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.920
 the straws as a whole motiv as 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.920
 macro motive 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.680
 so the first motive already had great 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.930
 worked out we come to the next 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.850
 I have this piece of plexiglas here 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.210
 I will now touch two of them 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.580
 Attach double-sided adhesive tape and 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.590
 then I will then the individual 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.480
 sticking colorful straws 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.070
 Of course, the whole is from the top 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.410
 seen down a wall the 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.000
 Position it vertically in front of the window 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.540
 is again a nice view 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.080
 do not move from hands and the whole 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.680
 gives a very abstract and it saves 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.680
 motive 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.019
 that 's it for me today 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.000
 Hope you liked the video 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.680
 I wish you much fun while copying 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.519
 Of course the whole project is worthwhile 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.950
 on an embarrassed weekend around his 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.659
 to employ children as I said a lot 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.989
 fun while imitating until the next 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.680
 times 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.680
 Hello
