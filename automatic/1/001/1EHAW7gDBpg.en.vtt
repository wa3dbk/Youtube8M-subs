00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.870 

and<00:01:45.750> no<00:01:45.990> no<00:01:46.440> real<00:01:46.650> pattern<00:01:46.920> but<00:01:47.370> just<00:01:47.580> kind<00:01:47.790> of

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
and no no real pattern but just kind of

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.180

concentrating<00:01:48.660> it<00:01:48.750> on<00:01:48.900> the<00:01:49.020> edges<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.530> then<00:01:50.100> I

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
concentrating it on the edges and then I

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.860 
concentrating it on the edges and then I
go<00:01:50.370> into<00:01:50.580> the<00:01:50.790> area<00:01:51.240> where<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.420> have<00:01:51.660> in<00:01:51.780> my

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
the puddle and then letting the fabric

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.610 
the puddle and then letting the fabric
just<00:02:42.000> kind<00:02:42.180> of<00:02:42.270> pick<00:02:42.480> it<00:02:42.630> up<00:02:42.750> naturally<00:02:43.020> and

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
just kind of pick it up naturally and

just kind of want to you know splash it
up<00:02:48.780> though<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:49.650> less<00:02:49.890> time<00:02:50.370> I<00:02:50.670> find<00:02:51.000> that<00:02:51.299> the

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
up though the less time I find that the

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.390 
up though the less time I find that the
fabrics<00:02:51.840> actually<00:02:52.140> sitting<00:02:52.350> in<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.560> dye<00:02:52.709> the

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
fabrics actually sitting in the dye the

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.340 
fabrics actually sitting in the dye the
better<00:02:53.580> effects<00:02:54.150> that<00:02:54.330> you<00:02:54.840> achieve<00:02:55.140> with

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
better effects that you achieve with

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.039 
better effects that you achieve with
this<00:02:55.530> hmm<00:02:56.370> see<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.180> faster<00:02:57.570> you<00:02:57.660> do<00:02:57.840> it<00:02:57.870> the

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
this hmm see the faster you do it the

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.830 
this hmm see the faster you do it the
better<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.739> results<00:02:59.000> I'm<00:03:00.000> not<00:03:00.180> you<00:03:00.330> just<00:03:00.360> done

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
better the results I'm not you just done

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.540 
better the results I'm not you just done
a<00:03:00.870> splash<00:03:01.350> it<00:03:01.590> really<00:03:02.010> really<00:03:02.220> quickly

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.820 

alright<00:03:07.550> alright<00:03:09.130> and

know the less you overwork it mm-hmm
the<00:03:17.170> better<00:03:17.380> the<00:03:17.590> result<00:03:21.120> jump<00:03:22.120> a<00:03:22.360> little<00:03:22.690> bit

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
the better the result jump a little bit

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.490 
the better the result jump a little bit
less<00:03:23.640> concentrated

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.819

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599 
you know you want it pre wet the fabric

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:39.589 
you know you want it pre wet the fabric
a<00:03:38.930> little<00:03:39.050> bit
