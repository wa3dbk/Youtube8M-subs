tutorial now we're ready to begin
tracking<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.060> helmet

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750 
tracking the helmet

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.690 
tracking the helmet
to<00:00:26.350> do<00:00:26.470> this<00:00:26.680> the<00:00:27.010> first<00:00:27.250> thing<00:00:27.430> you<00:00:27.520> have<00:00:27.580> to

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:27.700 
to do this the first thing you have to

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.250 
to do this the first thing you have to
do<00:00:27.880> is<00:00:28.000> go<00:00:28.119> to<00:00:28.180> the<00:00:28.300> first<00:00:28.600> frame<00:00:28.840> where<00:00:29.170> the

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:29.260 
do is go to the first frame where the

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.769 
do is go to the first frame where the
helmet<00:00:29.590> is<00:00:29.650> in<00:00:29.770> view<00:00:30.010> so<00:00:30.730> right<00:00:31.210> about<00:00:31.330> here

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 
helmet is in view so right about here

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.260 
helmet is in view so right about here
would<00:00:31.990> be<00:00:32.020> good<00:00:32.290> now<00:00:33.220> go<00:00:33.370> to<00:00:33.430> your<00:00:33.550> sidebar<00:00:33.910> and

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
would be good now go to your sidebar and

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.410 
would be good now go to your sidebar and
knit<00:00:34.420> tracker<00:00:34.750> then<00:00:35.200> hit<00:00:35.440> track<00:00:35.770> motion<00:00:36.420> this

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
knit tracker then hit track motion this

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.000 
knit tracker then hit track motion this
makes<00:00:37.660> a<00:00:37.780> tracking<00:00:38.140> market<00:00:38.440> that<00:00:38.590> you<00:00:38.650> can<00:00:38.800> use

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
makes a tracking market that you can use

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.860 
makes a tracking market that you can use
to<00:00:39.040> track<00:00:39.340> a<00:00:39.400> point<00:00:39.700> on<00:00:39.850> the<00:00:39.970> helmet<00:00:40.270> make<00:00:40.840> sure

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
to track a point on the helmet make sure

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.540 
to track a point on the helmet make sure
to<00:00:41.020> pick<00:00:41.200> a<00:00:41.260> point<00:00:41.500> on<00:00:41.710> the<00:00:41.830> helmet<00:00:42.129> as<00:00:42.280> a<00:00:42.309> high

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
to pick a point on the helmet as a high

to pick a point on the helmet as a high
contrast<00:00:42.970> of<00:00:43.210> the<00:00:43.300> area<00:00:43.600> around<00:00:43.720> it<00:00:44.080> so<00:00:44.860> allow

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
contrast of the area around it so allow

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.920 
contrast of the area around it so allow
our<00:00:45.220> marker<00:00:45.580> to<00:00:45.730> track<00:00:45.970> it<00:00:46.120> more<00:00:46.300> easily<00:00:46.480> a

track the motion as the clip plays
through<00:01:03.820> about<00:01:04.660> here<00:01:05.110> would<00:01:05.290> be<00:01:05.410> good<00:01:06.119> now<00:01:07.119> go

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
through about here would be good now go

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.060 
through about here would be good now go
back<00:01:07.479> to<00:01:07.630> the<00:01:07.750> tracker<00:01:08.020> and<00:01:08.229> start<00:01:08.470> analyzing

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
back to the tracker and start analyzing

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.249 
back to the tracker and start analyzing
forward<00:01:09.430> one<00:01:09.640> frame<00:01:09.850> this<00:01:10.720> allows<00:01:10.990> you<00:01:11.140> to

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
forward one frame this allows you to

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:13.050 
forward one frame this allows you to
make<00:01:11.440> sure<00:01:11.680> that<00:01:11.920> the<00:01:12.009> marker<00:01:12.490> is<00:01:12.640> tracking

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
make sure that the marker is tracking

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.960 
make sure that the marker is tracking
onto<00:01:13.240> the<00:01:13.330> helmet<00:01:13.630> correctly<00:01:14.080> as<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:15.640> can<00:01:15.729> see

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
onto the helmet correctly as you can see

when<00:01:18.700> this<00:01:18.820> happened<00:01:19.180> you<00:01:19.270> simply<00:01:19.630> just<00:01:19.840> drag

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
when this happened you simply just drag

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.870 
when this happened you simply just drag
the<00:01:20.440> marker<00:01:20.619> back<00:01:20.950> onto<00:01:21.250> the<00:01:21.430> center<00:01:21.700> of<00:01:21.729> your

the marker back onto the center of your

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.300 
the marker back onto the center of your
point<00:01:22.180> faster<00:01:23.110> your<00:01:23.259> point<00:01:23.530> moves<00:01:23.740> the<00:01:24.130> more

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
point faster your point moves the more

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.719 
point faster your point moves the more
often<00:01:24.640> you'll<00:01:24.820> have<00:01:24.970> to<00:01:25.119> do<00:01:25.270> this<00:01:25.479> now<00:01:26.729> that

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
often you'll have to do this now that

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.370 
often you'll have to do this now that
the<00:01:27.850> helmet<00:01:28.149> is<00:01:28.240> moving<00:01:28.539> slower<00:01:28.840> because

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
the helmet is moving slower because

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.080 
the helmet is moving slower because
either<00:01:29.649> the<00:01:29.920> trackers<00:01:30.340> at<00:01:30.490> me<00:01:30.580> a<00:01:30.640> better<00:01:30.820> time

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
either the trackers at me a better time

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.660 
either the trackers at me a better time
at<00:01:31.270> guessing<00:01:31.450> where<00:01:31.720> it<00:01:31.840> is

if the point you're tracking ever goes
out<00:01:37.340> of<00:01:37.460> you<00:01:37.700> it's<00:01:38.330> best<00:01:38.600> to<00:01:38.659> just<00:01:38.689> pick

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
out of you it's best to just pick

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.960 
out of you it's best to just pick
another<00:01:39.170> point<00:01:39.439> I<00:01:39.680> contrast<00:01:40.369> those<00:01:40.549> nearest
