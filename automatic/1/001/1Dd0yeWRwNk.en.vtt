00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:07.649
 My name is vinícius and this one is the one 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.110
 comic bitch starting from comics 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.300
 the hulk for today we have two reviews 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.130
 we start with flash by following in 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.779
 in front of a hq that I read very fast 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:21.330
 this one is the first bound of the 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.420
 flash for the new 52 when the usual 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.340
 decided to start your universe then 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.960
 It's an excellent HP platter that wants 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.789
 know the character the story begins 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.920
 when a bel childhood friend 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.120
 healing comes into your life a friend 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.520
 called manoel 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.350
 He seems very scared and says 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.059
 that is being pursued this first 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.370
 part of the incarnate will tell a little 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.649
 of the history of the manoel as he met 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.899
 berg the everything that happened in his life 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.640
 while flash faces an army of 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.920
 clones more ahead we have two 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.110
 plots one involving the cold captain 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.840
 where it develops similar powers 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.850
 including those of sub zero with arms 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.219
 frozen and another pot will deal with 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.510
 the acceleration force and the flash having 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.030
 save some people who are 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.549
 lost in time and bound ends 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.080
 with hook next volume were eight 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.939
 flash editions compiled here 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.369
 first point that mark that has a 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.650
 cool climate to read knows the art of 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.720
 french in the po is very good 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.850
 recordings of it are are not 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.650
 repetitive know are creative 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.180
 so it makes reading very good you know 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.490
 very fluent my problem with the 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.290
 history is the excess of clichés during 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.570
 the fifth flash is placed in a 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.049
 situation where it appears to be 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.619
 dead but what the voter knows who is going 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.659
 die 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.340
 after all is a character who is alive 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.280
 so the magazine has an issue in the month 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.020
 and the writers create a drama 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.270
 woe beast does he died after 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.000
 has that old friend's cliché of 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.759
 childhood that comes back and miraculously 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.040
 a great importance in the plot of the hero 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.899
 and to finish the main character 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.149
 I discovered something terrible about your 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.549
 powers that can change everything in your life 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.500
 holy creativity batman anyway then it is 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.780
 an incarnate they have these lot of 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.700
 clichés but until it was cool leandro 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.680
 It 's a cool climate for history and 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.509
 everything I think this likes flash and 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.910
 It's not as boring as I think it will not 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.489
 Let's disappoint the heroes. 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.670
 of Marvel wolverine released in the 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.280
 red cover collection 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.680
 from salvatti's first point says 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.970
 john is a guy who knows how to write a hq 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.430
 of wolverine I practically accompanied 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.140
 his whole phase in the character I 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.690
 accompanied the messages of the little girl was 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.040
 very cool, I just stopped reading when 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.050
 wolverine went to hell 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.120
 There, I can not take it but it's a guy. 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.340
 who can hit the character and 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.100
 this is his first bow in government and 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.140
 my friends art is also very good is 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.610
 ron garney here in history 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.340
 wolverine he is always taking shot 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.620
 or being blown up and the way he 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.410
 drawing logo is very sad it all in 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.780
 raw meat knows everything is blown up 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.850
 rejected the story divided into two 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.310
 time lines one that happens after 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.190
 of the messiah complex where the wolverine 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.170
 covering the cycle of chasing and 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.970
 to kill the mystic and the other that is 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.100
 past is presented the first 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.750
 wolverine encounter with the mystique and 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.730
 Anyway, the recommendation is 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.700
 story is very cool 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.440
 is not something our a thousand of them a classic 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.750
 but it's cool, I did not regret having 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.310
 bought the classic story that good that 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.030
 should know in this cover collection 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.470
 red 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.690
 always have a classic story and 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.250
 then a main arch and here we have the 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.730
 first appearance of wolverine in 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.730
 comic books 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.320
 Good people, I hope so. 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:31.329

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:34.510
 I barely took my whole voice 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.400
