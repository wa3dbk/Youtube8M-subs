the<00:03:06.049> surface<00:03:06.500> to<00:03:06.620> be<00:03:06.739> thinner<00:03:06.980> however<00:03:07.640> I

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
the surface to be thinner however I

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.940 
the surface to be thinner however I
think<00:03:07.940> this<00:03:08.030> is<00:03:08.209> a<00:03:08.239> personal<00:03:08.720> preference<00:03:08.959> the
