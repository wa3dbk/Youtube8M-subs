00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello and welcome you are 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.210
 on the move and puts your children 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.919
 already have a cellphone 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.420
 surely you also know the legal 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.070
 Radiation protection will be ours 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.509
 to preserve harmful cell phone radiation 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.549
 but they are not supposed to be 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.740
 high-frequency rays of the ears 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.820
 let it glow 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.670
 traditional long-term medical studies 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.730
 prove electrosmog can cause problems 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.050
 cause fatigue irritability 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.680
 headaches sleep disorders and such 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.619
 continue 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.840
 but that's why you do not need a mobile phone 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.340
 certainly not even headphones are not 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.170
 solution because they only carry that off 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.969
 problem there is this 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.980
 Protective covers and protective films the 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.809
 reduce transmission power 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.790
 However, the mobile phones then turn 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.620
 automatically the performance higher and the 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.930
 radiation amplified on the head region 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.190
 itself as already said the high-frequency 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.050
 Cellular radiation is not like that 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.820
 dangerous as previously thought by 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.800
 Numerous studies prove that it is the 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.780
 low frequency rays on ours 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.379
 Body reacts we call them the 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:02.690
 thermal effect this applies to 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.690
 disarm and that's exactly what wave does 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.060
 x6 is the world's only technology 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:13.200
 the mobile communication for ours 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:16.439

 Compensation immediately max is not 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.759
 comparable to commercial ones 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.049
 products that only the 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.049
 Radiation protection is used 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.069
 Now decide in waves 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:47.960

 more reliable and permanent 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:55.219
 Radiation protection and also is 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.439
 houellebecqs extremely cheap with webex 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:58.609

 no more thoughts about 

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:03.789
