what I love is bringing stuff waiting

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.990 
what I love is bringing stuff waiting
from<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.489> beginning<00:02:52.760> to<00:02:53.299> now<00:02:53.480> um<00:02:54.640> Kakashi<00:02:55.640> is

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
from the beginning to now um Kakashi is

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.699 
from the beginning to now um Kakashi is
the<00:02:56.690> one<00:02:56.840> that<00:02:56.959> kills<00:02:57.170> her<00:02:57.260> because<00:02:57.500> she's<00:02:57.680> a

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
the one that kills her because she's a

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.099 
the one that kills her because she's a
spy<00:02:58.370> for<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:58.849> Hidden<00:02:59.090> Mist<00:02:59.239> I<00:02:59.540> believe<00:02:59.900> it<00:02:59.989> was

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:00.109 
spy for the Hidden Mist I believe it was

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:01.809 
spy for the Hidden Mist I believe it was
the<00:03:00.170> Hidden<00:03:00.410> Mist<00:03:00.530> and<00:03:00.769> that's<00:03:01.340> pretty<00:03:01.459> crazy

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
the Hidden Mist and that's pretty crazy

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:03.640 
the Hidden Mist and that's pretty crazy
I<00:03:01.940> didn't<00:03:02.269> expect<00:03:02.599> that<00:03:02.660> from<00:03:02.780> her<00:03:03.049> but<00:03:03.500> I'm

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
I didn't expect that from her but I'm

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.319 
I didn't expect that from her but I'm
really<00:03:04.129> really<00:03:04.430> interested<00:03:04.760> in<00:03:05.030> seeing<00:03:05.209> what
