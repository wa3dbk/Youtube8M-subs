00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.570

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.620
 pay them off because there would be no 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.230
 they probably wouldn't have us thanks 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.110

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.029

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.010
 help support guide our 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.050
 teachers also thank you very much 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.340
 because we always teach in Kiev to hide 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.599
 dance because everyone has 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.559
 opportunity to go see 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:39.170
 cheer and we have a7 meet and everybody 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:44.120
 say so arobin and please your 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:46.699
 there just go, please, that's how you are 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.710
 do you think it is necessary before the tournament 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:50.989
 In a number of cases in the case of which the judge is judged 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:56.239
 these tournament but this is mecca's mouth very 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:58.580
 controversial question here because sometimes it 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.049
 it is appropriate sometimes not because if before 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.059
 I think a lot of tournament 

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:04.070
 do it a little dice and 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.650
 to orient you as a dancer 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.600
 I think before the tournament if there is 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.369
 opportunity for example there for a week or 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.869
 out the door and that's when I think ok 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.240
 you can think of some rest 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.850
 a certain plan until fruitful will 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.409
 But before the tournament, well, if we allow 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.020
 this is a teacher if you speak with whom 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:24.619
 For a long time you have been studying the way specially then 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.359
 Yes, I think you can tell about your 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.780
 creative plans where further dance 

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:31.939
 be the most important thing is blackpool guitars 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.500
 we will prepare and before that is possible 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.170
 there will be some more tournaments maybe even 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.359
 Ukraine, let's think about the house 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.229
 don't know exactly the main work yet 

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:46.280
 work Russian such a tricky question 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:50.420
 what is the most important for you in dance oh 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.999
 hard this is probably the most important thing and 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:57.079
 have such a partner and such a partner 

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:57.859
 that there was such a tandem inter exchange 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:59.600
 energies 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:01.400

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.710
 that we met each other and we can 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.030
 create something new something interesting 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.830
 not get drunk to have it 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.560
 to get it done especially 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.020
 when you dance in a tournament and huge 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.150
