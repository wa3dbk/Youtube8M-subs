00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
one myth people have thought true is

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.200 
one myth people have thought true is
that<00:05:40.420> tornadoes<00:05:41.170> cannot<00:05:41.530> cross<00:05:41.890> water<00:05:42.340> this

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
that tornadoes cannot cross water this

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.810 
that tornadoes cannot cross water this
is<00:05:43.540> definitely<00:05:43.810> false<00:05:44.530> because<00:05:45.040> a<00:05:45.100> waterspout

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
is definitely false because a waterspout

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.440 
is definitely false because a waterspout
is<00:05:46.090> a<00:05:46.120> type<00:05:46.420> of<00:05:46.450> tornado<00:05:46.960> that<00:05:47.110> forms<00:05:47.530> on<00:05:47.740> water

tornadoes<00:05:49.450> can<00:05:49.810> also<00:05:50.170> form<00:05:50.860> on<00:05:51.130> land<00:05:51.460> and

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 
tornadoes can also form on land and

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.420 
tornadoes can also form on land and
cross<00:05:52.210> bodies<00:05:52.810> of<00:05:52.990> water<00:05:53.230> such<00:05:53.680> as<00:05:53.740> rivers<00:05:54.250> or
