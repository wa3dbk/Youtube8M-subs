thinning<00:00:24.689> scissors<00:00:26.000> in<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.210> salon<00:00:27.630> I'm

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
thinning scissors in the salon I'm

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.599 
thinning scissors in the salon I'm
straight<00:00:28.500> scissors<00:00:28.769> because<00:00:29.279> it's<00:00:29.400> much

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
straight scissors because it's much

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.110 
straight scissors because it's much
quicker<00:00:30.590> and<00:00:31.590> what<00:00:31.890> we<00:00:32.009> want<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.279> do<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.669> we

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
quicker and what we want to do is we

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.880 
quicker and what we want to do is we
hold<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.510> scissors<00:00:33.750> at<00:00:34.530> 90<00:00:34.980> degree<00:00:35.640> angle<00:00:36.390> and

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
hold the scissors at 90 degree angle and

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.160 
hold the scissors at 90 degree angle and
if<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:38.010> can<00:00:38.190> imagine<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:39.239> point<00:00:39.570> in<00:00:39.750> between

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
if you can imagine the point in between

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.990 
if you can imagine the point in between
his<00:00:40.320> eyes<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.219> middle<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.820> circle<00:00:42.890> so

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
his eyes is the middle of the circle so

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.970 
his eyes is the middle of the circle so
where<00:00:45.000> I've<00:00:45.300> actually<00:00:45.750> trimmed<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.950> the

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
where I've actually trimmed to the

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.940 
where I've actually trimmed to the
corner<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.550> his<00:00:47.640> ear<00:00:48.140> these<00:00:49.140> little<00:00:49.559> ear<00:00:49.649> bits

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
corner of his ear these little ear bits

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.160 
corner of his ear these little ear bits
are<00:00:50.190> going<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.460> stick<00:00:50.730> out<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.239> circle<00:00:51.750> so

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
are going to stick out of the circle so

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.229 
are going to stick out of the circle so
we<00:00:52.289> have<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.469> circle<00:00:53.039> with<00:00:53.219> two<00:00:53.640> little<00:00:54.120> ears

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
we have a circle with two little ears

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.270 
we have a circle with two little ears
sticking<00:00:54.930> out<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:58.170> first<00:00:58.469> trim<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:58.949> do<00:00:59.010> on

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
sticking out so the first trim I do on

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.700 
sticking out so the first trim I do on
it<00:00:59.430> on<00:00:59.609> arrestee<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.449> actually<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.960> side<00:01:01.289> of

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
it on arrestee is actually the side of

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.450 
it on arrestee is actually the side of
the<00:01:01.949> head

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
the head

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.500 
the head
so<00:01:03.329> hole<00:01:03.539> juice<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:04.430> 90-degree<00:01:05.430> angle<00:01:05.510> come

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
so hole juice is a 90-degree angle come

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.539 
so hole juice is a 90-degree angle come
behind<00:01:06.900> with<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.350> coat<00:01:07.680> with<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.010> blade

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
flat on the body and I scissor I don't

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.969 
flat on the body and I scissor I don't
want<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.840> go<00:01:16.020> as<00:01:16.290> far<00:01:16.320> as<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.520> ear<00:01:18.020> so<00:01:19.020> scissor

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
want to go as far as the ear so scissor

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:28.280 
want to go as far as the ear so scissor
just<00:01:20.520> before<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.420> ear<00:01:26.150> right<00:01:27.150> now<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.900> create

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
just before the ear right now to create

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.219 
just before the ear right now to create
this<00:01:28.530> presentable<00:01:29.280> effect<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:31.009> quiz<00:01:32.009> anthem<00:01:32.400> is

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
this presentable effect a quiz anthem is

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.260 
this presentable effect a quiz anthem is
obviously<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.350> flower<00:01:34.619> but<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.700> petals<00:01:36.090> are

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
obviously a flower but the petals are

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.020 
obviously a flower but the petals are
shorter<00:01:36.689> at<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.900> bottom<00:01:37.290> going<00:01:38.159> longer<00:01:38.820> at

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
shorter at the bottom going longer at

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.550 
shorter at the bottom going longer at
the<00:01:39.210> top<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.750> this<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:39.990> what<00:01:40.140> we<00:01:40.290> want<00:01:40.500> to

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
the top and this is what we want to

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.780 
the top and this is what we want to
create<00:01:41.180> with<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.360> Westie<00:01:42.810> head

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
create with the Westie head

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.539 
create with the Westie head
so<00:01:44.790> obviously<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.509> coat<00:01:45.869> must<00:01:46.229> be<00:01:46.380> shorter<00:01:47.040> at

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
so obviously the coat must be shorter at

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.600 
so obviously the coat must be shorter at
the<00:01:47.729> base<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.420> body
