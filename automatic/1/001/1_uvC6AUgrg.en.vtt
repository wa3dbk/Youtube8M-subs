00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:46.329 
much as you can and I tried to get them

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:48.630 
much as you can and I tried to get them
as<00:01:46.899> accurate<00:01:47.590> as<00:01:47.679> possible<00:01:47.770> there's<00:01:48.490> some

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
as accurate as possible there's some

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.309 
as accurate as possible there's some
limitations<00:01:49.060> with<00:01:49.360> fight<00:01:49.720> night<00:01:49.929> so<00:01:50.170> it's

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:50.319 
limitations with fight night so it's

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:54.389 
limitations with fight night so it's
hard<00:01:50.500> to<00:01:50.590> get<00:01:50.709> them<00:01:50.830> like<00:01:52.110> totally<00:01:53.110> you<00:01:53.470> know

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
hard to get them like totally you know

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:57.419 
hard to get them like totally you know
the<00:01:54.670> same<00:01:55.679> you<00:01:56.679> know<00:01:56.799> there'll<00:01:57.280> be<00:01:57.310> some

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429 
the same you know there'll be some

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:00.779 
the same you know there'll be some
differences<00:01:58.090> in<00:01:58.149> height<00:01:58.689> wave<00:01:59.200> or<00:01:59.560> reach<00:01:59.830> but

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
differences in height wave or reach but

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:02.010 
differences in height wave or reach but
other<00:02:00.939> than<00:02:01.090> that<00:02:01.270> I'll<00:02:01.390> try<00:02:01.599> and<00:02:01.720> be<00:02:01.810> like

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
other than that I'll try and be like

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:12.920 
other than that I'll try and be like
really<00:02:03.209> on<00:02:04.209> point

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.790 

I've<00:02:13.709> been<00:02:13.920> take<00:02:14.159> long

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.290 

so<00:02:17.400> what<00:02:17.850> we're<00:02:18.030> going<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.270> do<00:02:18.950> is<00:02:20.300> balance

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
so what we're going to do is balance

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.440 
so what we're going to do is balance
ourselves<00:02:21.720> first<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:22.890> then<00:02:23.430> get<00:02:23.790> up<00:02:24.000> using

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
ourselves first and then get up using

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.810 
ourselves first and then get up using
the<00:02:24.780> right<00:02:24.960> stick<00:02:25.380> now<00:02:25.620> you<00:02:25.680> gotta<00:02:26.010> keep

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
the right stick now you gotta keep

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:34.340 
the right stick now you gotta keep
yourself<00:02:27.300> balanced<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:28.020> little<00:02:28.050> bit<00:02:33.200> you<00:02:34.200> know

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
yourself balanced a little bit you know

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.370 
yourself balanced a little bit you know
I'm<00:02:34.710> talking<00:02:35.040> about<00:02:35.070> white<00:02:35.520> taps<00:02:35.970> on<00:02:36.420> all<00:02:37.110> the

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
I'm talking about white taps on all the

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.370 
I'm talking about white taps on all the
L<00:02:37.560> and<00:02:37.920> R<00:02:38.040> sticks<00:02:38.430> and<00:02:38.760> then<00:02:39.570> just<00:02:39.780> give<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.290> a

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
L and R sticks and then just give it a

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:51.150 
L and R sticks and then just give it a
hard<00:02:41.450> you<00:02:42.450> know<00:02:42.570> our<00:02:42.840> stick<00:02:43.200> press<00:02:43.530> up<00:02:47.300> now

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.800 

now<00:02:52.160> it<00:02:52.400> gets<00:02:52.520> more<00:02:52.700> difficult<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.660> more

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
now it gets more difficult the more

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.260 
now it gets more difficult the more
times<00:02:54.140> you<00:02:54.680> get<00:02:54.830> knocked<00:02:55.100> down<00:02:55.250> obviously<00:02:56.240> I

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
times you get knocked down obviously I

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.870 
times you get knocked down obviously I
think<00:02:56.420> everyone<00:02:56.930> knows<00:02:57.080> that<00:02:57.140> by<00:02:57.500> now<00:02:57.680> so<00:02:58.430> what

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
think everyone knows that by now so what

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.030 
think everyone knows that by now so what
I<00:02:58.910> mean<00:02:59.270> by<00:02:59.330> that<00:02:59.510> is<00:02:59.900> that<00:03:00.260> like<00:03:00.530> the<00:03:00.980> L<00:03:01.490> and

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
I mean by that is that like the L and

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.010 
I mean by that is that like the L and
our<00:03:04.040> sticks<00:03:04.520> become<00:03:05.270> a<00:03:05.300> little<00:03:05.720> bit<00:03:05.810> more

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
our sticks become a little bit more

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.490 
our sticks become a little bit more
sensitive<00:03:06.670> when<00:03:07.670> you're<00:03:07.940> nearing<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:08.840> top<00:03:09.110> in

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
sensitive when you're nearing the top in

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.110 
sensitive when you're nearing the top in
the<00:03:10.160> green<00:03:10.460> on<00:03:10.760> that<00:03:10.820> bar<00:03:12.400> so<00:03:13.400> when<00:03:13.700> you<00:03:13.850> hold

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
the green on that bar so when you hold

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.450 
the green on that bar so when you hold
down<00:03:14.300> our<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:16.010> our<00:03:16.220> stick<00:03:16.610> to<00:03:16.940> get<00:03:17.270> up<00:03:18.460> you'll

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:19.460 
down our the our stick to get up you'll

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.730 
down our the our stick to get up you'll
have<00:03:19.790> the<00:03:20.450> more<00:03:20.630> time<00:03:20.840> to<00:03:21.020> get<00:03:21.170> knocked<00:03:21.380> down

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:21.740 
have the more time to get knocked down

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.850 
have the more time to get knocked down
you'll<00:03:22.340> have<00:03:22.580> a<00:03:22.930> harder<00:03:23.930> time<00:03:23.960> keeping<00:03:24.230> that

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
you'll have a harder time keeping that

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:25.390 
you'll have a harder time keeping that
bounce

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
bounce

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.980

really light taps on the L stick to help

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.490
