00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:14.289
 application of the oil that I left in the 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:18.070
 channel that is for the growth of 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:21.730

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:25.870
 and rosemary that video go see it 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.940

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:31.660
 what I have done that sees it then everything 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:34.510
 placed on this then on base so that 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.130
 it's much easier now to the 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.220
 time to apply them 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:43.490

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:49.250

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.860

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.880
 very much as you can see I'm going to give 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:53.970

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.970
 Where I already wear my hair's length 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.560

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.710

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.239
 I do twice a week and what I'm going to do 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.510

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:17.550

 go see the good progress we are going to 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.540
 the application 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.220
 it was girl already here what she has done in 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.920
 untangle my hair very well and now 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.770
 I go to the application I recommend them 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.800
 whenever you use a container like that 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.590
 He answered like this it is very easy at the time of 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.200
 the application ok and what we're going to do 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.170
 is to place they can also divide their 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.100
 hair and girls and inserts for 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:50.180
 apply your treatment but in this case 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:55.260
 I am going to introduce you this part here 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:58.010
 well because the oil also goes 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.010
 falling down 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.769
 all around the scalp 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.880
 You can also apply a few 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.680
 drops in his hand 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.739
 And apply 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:23.450
 at the tips those are the most 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:26.090
 problematic you can say it like this 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.000
 then apply your oil what you are going to 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:32.760
 do they will give them the yolk of their 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.920
 fingers are going to give some massages 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.920
 from the nape of the neck up 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:43.260
 or if you prefer top-down 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:48.140
 as you prefer 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:52.960
 gives a very gentle massage 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:56.590
 to cover everything the whole skull 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.790
 or all the scalp in better 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.310
 words girls 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.590
 this treatment is also the 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.769
 I recommend for the guys that it's very 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.870
 good that they have problems falling 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:14.319
 hair since this treatment then 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:14.319
 also help for hair loss 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:21.959
 after having given one more to those these 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.870
 massage can do it for five 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.420
 minutes but not for him not to do 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.990
 the video so long what I'm going to do is 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.669
 Well quickie but you know 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.100
 excuse me for a little bit I'm going to pick up 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:37.580
 here 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:42.380
 then we go to the girls they put and 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:46.030
 they pick up their hair there with a skewer 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:48.560
 what they have on hand and they will place 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.450
 a plastic cap 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.830
 I am going to use this for you can 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.830
 use the one that you have 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.800
 and there it is 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:06.729
 This treatment can be left in your 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:09.189
 hair for an hour maximum one hour 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:11.620
 they do not have to leave it much more what 

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:14.530
 maximum is one hour then wash your 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:17.259
 hair with your shampoo I recommend you 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.000
 use warm water 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:23.470
 then the final language coso 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:26.170
 conditioning use cold water 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:28.020
 and that's all they have to do 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:31.960
 I highly recommend this treatment 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:34.270

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.450
