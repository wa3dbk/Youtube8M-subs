 at 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.900
 I'm here to put in jail 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.480
 according to the mayor 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.480
 the most important thing 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.150
 according to the team 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.750
 in the field 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.420
 what will allow you to 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.220
 on site our job is two years 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.220
 publicly like that 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.840
 as the year before 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.060

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.200

 you show the mayor 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.140
 so it's a ring 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.740
 I am happy 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.740
 more and more to put foot 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.180
 - 08 33 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.180
 it's like that 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.100
 yes I am a little more possible 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.340
 a little after 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.340
 they quote names 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.600

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.450
 from this episode a ten-year sentence of dummy to antibes 

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:15.119
 so 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.519
 and then the clash 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:25.159
 difficult language 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.819
 that's what supported 

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:36.839
