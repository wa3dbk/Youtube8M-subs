00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.060
 watch the 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.470
 environmental effects as to the use of sweet 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.299
 water 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.369
 this video is the fourth part of the 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:13.260
 six episodes that are about it 

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:15.410
 deal with the natural sweet resource 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.410
 water 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.900
 We can do the environmental impact of it 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.060
 divide use of fresh water into water 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.240
 problems in cities in water problems 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.400
 in the countryside 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.860
 in the cities many people become and is 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.110
 consumes a lot of industry or a lot of water 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.390
 play in developing countries 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.100
 other problems in the city we are 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.900
 bad water pipes 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.180
 we are leaks causing a lot of water 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.190
 is wasted by that too little 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.960
 public taps are must people 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.260
 wait more than an hour for one 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.260
 bucket of water 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.660
 are pants and none or bad 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.360
 water treatment plants to it 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.489
 purify contaminated water until none 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.230
 purification of sewage water 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.820
 and industry or for substances loosely in 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.229
 rivers, a water becomes unclean 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.880
 people who face training to water 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.880
 use can become seriously ill 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.440
 you this had the water of amstelveen and 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.700
 surroundings so early water treatment 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.410
 what a smile you look threatens everything 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.220
 in what I actually don't belong in 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.220
 which name 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:40.690
 the shoulder of everything will be detergent 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.640
 turpentine frying fat 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.410
 bread and what controller is there really 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.260
 of course dc papers 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.840
 you cannot escape this shower 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.590
 wash off wash will car all kinds of one 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.490
 sewer 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.850
 but we are not there yet but tasty 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.850
 cheese sandwich 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.820
 cotton buds this is the Netherlands it 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.619
 sometimes it rains and we love it 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.619
 shower and more 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.959
 the schedule here is actually one 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.580
 kind of safe 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.580
 faith would exit the breed first 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.630
 yes super hear what you cinsault 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.430
 they just go through this water 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.430
 goes through a pre-settling tank 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.930
 the coarse dirt is left here 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.630
 the water stays for a longer time 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.990
 all heavy particles stand still as sam 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.790
 and metal particles sink to the bottom 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.470
 to the dirt that is here on the surface 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.890
 left behind is collected and 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.890
 carried away 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:01.930
 driving woman becomes as it were 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.930
 scraped off 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.970
 the sunken dirt is suctioned and it 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.090
 water flows over the edge so think about it 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.090
 I 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.940
 But there are particles that are in the water 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:26.580
 live or be dissolved as one is 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.950
 and detergents become bacteria 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.420
 added to this but also soap or cool 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.129
 break behind 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.290
 but oxygen is needed for that 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:41.760
 hence this is an aeration tank here 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:43.590
 I get air here with very big ones 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.769
 reverse clutch shower you remember 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.640
 blown or release from the waste water 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:52.220
 languages 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.220
 use some chemical substance requirements glory 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.970
 this substance is added for in the 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.209
 water from one tank to the other 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.209
 flows 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.560
 the phosphates entered the requirements and 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.070
 then flaky form and that focus 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.070
 lower to the bottom 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.970
 in the last tank I see the nabe I think 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.340
 the swords made particles fall 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.280
 along with a slip with the bacteria to 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.840
 down with the basic flow of potions 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.470
 and is collected to go to the amstel 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.470
 much comes to be 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.880
 the quality is comparable to a 4 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.170
 water but you can't drink it then 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.170
 must first be purified 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.720
 about 17 percent of all freshwater 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.300
 in the world is used by the 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.210
 agriculture is the us farmland 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.250
 increased and many groundwater 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:56.270
 which uses groundwater touched on 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:58.010
 then there is exhaustion and special 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.200
 problem we cause agriculture is 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.480
 salinization that goes as follows 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.970
 when the land is sprayed , it drops 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.980
 water in the ground due to the lack of 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.740
 drainage locks 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.870
 the groundwater rises by the power of 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.840
 sucked in the sun or to the surface 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.940
 and it just evaporates the salt in it 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.180
 water are left behind 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.560
 so terribly salt layer on the battery because 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.710
 therefore nothing can be lost on the now 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.180
 the land is also growing 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.920
 drying out 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.170
 groundwater in the case of language dehydration 

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.690
 such that the plants do not have enough water 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:35.540
 get more 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.290
 drought creates three causes 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.900
 Agriculture 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.760
 worked with large machines that machines 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.100
 can only drive on dry ground 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.529
 otherwise they sink away so the 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:47.659
 groundwater level lowered 

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:49.039
 the rapid drainage of rainwater to 

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:51.709
 closed sewers 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:53.629
 is the second cause of dehydration 

00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:54.979
 In the last 50 years there has been a lot in the Netherlands 

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:56.689
 built 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:06:00.939
 not result in the side rainwater 

00:05:56.689 --> 00:06:00.939
 lower the soil and the groundwater level drops 

00:06:01.369 --> 00:06:06.229
 the third cause is the pumping up 

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:08.719
 too much groundwater with the rising 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:10.579
 prosperity and more inhabitants or more 

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:14.149
 groundwater pumped up 

00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:16.249
 the groundwater level sinks through 

00:06:14.149 --> 00:06:18.739
 then all sorts of environmental problems by 

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:20.329
 there is dehydration and groundwater drops 

00:06:18.739 --> 00:06:21.319
 the plants can no longer have enough water 

00:06:20.329 --> 00:06:23.689
 to get 

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:25.849
 You call this an environmental damage all 

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:27.439
 changes in the environment 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:28.789
 the habitat of plants and animals 

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:30.859
 changed who by the way 

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:34.369
 environmental damage 

00:06:30.859 --> 00:06:36.679
 Deforestation falls here is also covered by it 

00:06:34.369 --> 00:06:38.659
 pollute the living environment by it 

00:06:36.679 --> 00:06:39.919
 dumping of waste discharging 

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:42.529
 waste 

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:44.209
 call it environmental pollution 

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:47.520
 for example the factories that are toxic 

00:06:44.209 --> 00:06:50.009
 substances in rivers 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.259
 we still have environmental exhaustion this 

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:53.280
 means that you remove so much dust from the 

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:54.539
 moulure 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.610
 without the environment 

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:59.099
 restore, for example, the extraction of 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:02.009
 minerals or intensive agriculture 

00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:05.639
 the soil from well or the depletion of the 

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:07.560
 ground water supply, the water is 

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:09.240
 exhausted and polluted 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.340
 and that is why rich countries want sustainability 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.960
 water management 

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.819
 That means you only get the 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.129
 renewable for the water allowed 

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:18.389
 and that you filled water again 

00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:20.400
 purifies 

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:23.180
 then the next generations have too 

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.180
 plenty of clean water 

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.520
 we have become wiser about the 

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:27.750
 environmental impact of the use of sweet 

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.550
 water 

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.900
 there are two more movies that are about 

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:32.819
 large scale 

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:35.780
 against small-scale measures 

00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:35.780
 water problems
