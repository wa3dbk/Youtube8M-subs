 peppers 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.720
 that to gratin in my case 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.570
 mozarella 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.270

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.380
 broth concentrate tablet 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.910
 Chicken The first thing we are going to do is 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.130
 empty the peppers to be able 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.440
 fill them in so let's take them off in 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:00.400
 the top cover 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:04.800
 [Music] 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:07.210
 and now we have cut we throw it 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.650
 and we take it off 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.650
 all these bits 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.560
 and so we have it ready for 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.630
 fill them and so we will do with the 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.420
 following once the 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.130
 peppers you have three options the 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.259
 first option is to put them in the 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.030
 microwaves like I'm going to do the 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.420
 second is to put it in the oven 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.509
 preheated to 200 degrees for about 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.520
 15 minutes and the third is to fill it 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.810
 as they are and before putting the 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.970
 we put it in the oven 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.979
 preheated to 200 degrees until 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.650
 the peppers are tender 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.630
 we will leave 7 minutes at maximum power 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.000
 after seven minutes our 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.340
 peppers are already ready so let's go 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.200
 to start making the filling we put a 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.880
 little oil in a pan we put it 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.550
 over medium high heat and wait for 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:01.500
 be hot once the oil is 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:04.110
 hot we put garlic onion 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.380
 we will move it and wait for it to fry 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.750
 moving it once in a while once 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.670
 this ready sofrito we will add the 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.940
 mushrooms we move them 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:18.260
 [Music] 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:21.250
 and we also add the bacon and the meat and 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.250
 we move it very well 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.890
 after a few minutes when the 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.430
 meat is undone we add the 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.740
 broth concentrate pepper 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:41.590
 taste the salt 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.590
 and the parsley and we move it very well 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.970
 we throw the wine 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.550
 we'll put a strong fire to 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.090
 evaporate the alcohol and we will move it from time to time 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.090
 in when 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.780
 once the alcohol has evaporated 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.590
 we add the almond flour what 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.590
 we move very well 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.700
 so we have our fill ready 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.350
 we put out the fire and we put it away now 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.150
 we will put the oven to preheat with 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.940
 heat up and down to 200 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.980
 degrees and we went to fill our 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.240
 peppers that we have put in a 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.240
 oven-safe tray 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:31.540
 [Music] 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.400
 and so we will do with the following and now 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.970
 We had to put some cheese 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.970
 each 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.310
 we have it ready and I have made him 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.650
 also a little oregano on top 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.110
 of the cheese and we're going to put it in the 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.390
 we will leave it with heat from above 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.310
 and down to 200 degrees with turbo 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.600
 fan if your oven has 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.930
 him so that's free 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.750
 [Applause] 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.730
 in my case after seven minutes the 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.209
 cheese is already gratin so let's go 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.209
 take them out 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.379
 we have it ready and we have been 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:12.599
 with a great pint we can 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:15.150
 accompany with a tomato sauce and some 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:17.100
 potatoes that is the ideal accompaniment and 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.500
 Now I'm going to move on to try one because 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.209
