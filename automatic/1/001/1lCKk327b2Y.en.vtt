watch<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.180> much<00:00:45.329> because<00:00:46.550> it<00:00:47.550> wasn't<00:00:47.969> that

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
before reading the books I might have

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.619 
before reading the books I might have
actually<00:00:52.649> liked<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.190> but<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.760> read<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.480> books

enough<00:04:31.900> to<00:04:32.230> take<00:04:32.950> another<00:04:33.250> ten<00:04:33.610> years<00:04:34.000> to

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
enough to take another ten years to
