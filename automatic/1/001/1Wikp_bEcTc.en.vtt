00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
which obviously has a really high

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.850 
which obviously has a really high
caliber<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.600> with<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.140> helmet<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.500> can<00:01:13.530> take<00:01:13.830> a

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
caliber and with the helmet I can take a

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.920 
caliber and with the helmet I can take a
total<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.430> three<00:01:14.790> bullets<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.330> face<00:01:15.600> now

total of three bullets to the face now

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.359 
total of three bullets to the face now
I'm<00:01:16.049> not<00:01:16.170> sure<00:01:16.200> if<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.770> weak<00:01:17.040> sniper

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
I'm not sure if this is the weak sniper

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.280 
I'm not sure if this is the weak sniper
or<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.759> heavy<00:01:17.970> sniper<00:01:18.240> obviously<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.140> could

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
or the heavy sniper obviously you could

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.170 
or the heavy sniper obviously you could
take<00:01:19.470> less<00:01:19.740> if<00:01:19.979> it's<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.310> heavy<00:01:20.520> one<00:01:20.610> but<00:01:21.000> that's

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
take less if it's a heavy one but that's

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.820 
take less if it's a heavy one but that's
absolutely<00:01:21.540> insane<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.049> think<00:01:22.200> about<00:01:22.560> because

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
absolutely insane to think about because

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.469 
absolutely insane to think about because
the<00:01:22.979> sniper<00:01:23.310> rifle<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:23.880> an<00:01:24.000> extremely

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
the sniper rifle is an extremely

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.330 
the sniper rifle is an extremely
