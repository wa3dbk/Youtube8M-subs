 other macbook at the console ps3 that's 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.980
 also valid for the xbox but for 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.850
 our video will be with the ps3 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.290
 also works on windows pc that we go 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:55.350
 we're going to go on safari 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:58.080
 you type ps3 media server for mac mac 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.460
 sorry, here you choose a little the 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:04.680
 site you want a point click 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.270
 here it is free it is complete there 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.560
 is waiting for you the 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.530
 download and then install it 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.570
 this is software for those who would have 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.840
 makes the latest update on 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.800
 their mac you're going to have a problem 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.390
 you will be able to install 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.210
 the application but you can not 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.409
 use it to solve this 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.560
 problem you go into preferences 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.560
 system 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:37.950
 you explained then you go on 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:40.410
 safety and sailing has allowed the 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.640
 downloaded applications from any 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.280
 or 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.020
 of origin he put it on mac apple 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.830
 store and developers so that's why 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.730
 that you can not use 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:55.890
 the application so once you effect 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:59.340
 these you start the console step 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.830
 you launch the application so hop not 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.840
 our configuration so here you can 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:08.099
 everything changed after a heavy trick 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.979
 once your console is on 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.810
 he will find it like these if not that 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.560
 puts you a big red logo 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.680
 like that she's not on 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.020
 way all the rest no me there is not 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.209
 big thing has changed 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:26.000
 after that's going to be for the sound the quality 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:30.830
 video but good original everything is everything 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.920
 pretty well configured so for us we 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.440
 will go on navigation sharing of 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.230
 folders here you add the folders 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.080
 that you want to appear on the 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.130
 console so for that if you click on 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.910
 the little green cross and you are looking for 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.799
 your records 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.290
 so never put the 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.850
 file you want to see but must 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.510
 take it back 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:59.870
 for example for here must take the 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:03.110
 folder download and choose it and no 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.940
 click and then take the video 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.650
 like the test I'm doing this to you 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.720
 will be with the movie the simpsons 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.940
 because we can see that we can 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:15.819
 not click on it so you have to 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:19.880
 take download and choose it 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:21.700
 so he will be there he in English but that's 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.810
 exactly the same thing 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:29.140
 so once you 've done 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.140
 you have more than lit the console 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.920
 on the console now 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:39.670
 6 so if you want to watch a 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:42.400
 video here you have video and have it 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.580
 found the ps3 media server you click 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.580
 above 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.390
 that's it then then you take no 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:04:01.130
 music because I will have no 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:04:04.100
 music you go in onal is there 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.600
 to find that's the simpson pitcher that 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.450
 was in my download file 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:12.680
 on their say so we can see that it is 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:14.750
 launches smoothly good quality 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.640
 is not at the top but it's the quality 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.640
 manure not that she's not very good 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.740
 so after that we just had to put 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.230
 the music you want the videos 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.180
 the photos if you want a music 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:40.680
 always have to go in the category 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.720
 music and then ps3 media server 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.620
 music 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.070
 I think that could go even 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:52.030
 directly on itunes music library 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:54.330
 and here and after you are full 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:05:08.730
 to choose your music 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:10.780
 and it works without problem voltage so 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.290
 what did I want to do 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:16.000
 always your pc is on of course 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.440
 is that the software is launched a 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.360
 previous it is rare that another 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.160
 problem I hope the video will have you 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.100
 I'm really sorry for the 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.880
 quality of the video on the ps3 I had 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.100
 not really the choice 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.440
 you will understand that it is not 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.720
 necessary to put the music the 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.790
 movies on the hard disk of the ps3 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:38.530
 could leave them on the hard drive of 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:41.270
 the pc or on an external hard drive for 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:44.090
 the next videos in 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:46.249
 there is the rise test of hate as 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.499
 promised 

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:51.169
 to come out in games that happens a 

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:51.559
 I will show you a lot of 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:53.359
 things 

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:57.169
 how is it worth it is 16 

00:05:53.359 --> 00:06:00.709
 euros if the dictation really works the 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:02.209
 messages and so this is so anyway 

00:06:00.709 --> 00:06:04.339
 you liked the video a little inch 

00:06:02.209 --> 00:06:05.119
 and then if not I'll see you soon for 

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:08.049
 new videos 

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:08.049
 chacha
