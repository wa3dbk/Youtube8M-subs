00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:07.440
 Hello everyone today, I want to show how 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:11.400
 to cut off 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:15.060
 how to trim a currant bush 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.520
 we have a perennial currant bush 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:20.450
 which has not been cut off for a very long time 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.060
 As you can see 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:28.010
 on it a huge number of branches and 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:33.380
 as many of them as it is not necessary first 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:38.110
 queue need to trim the oldest 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.110
 branches that is, it is clear from them that they 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:47.239
 their thickest punes are almost 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:50.559
 everything went bad and we cut them off 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.559
 the very bottom of the very root 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.879
 that is, we will cut off all the old branches 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:14.830
 all old branches are pruned in this way 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:21.490
 we enable young branches to grow 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:23.850
 and our harvest will be bigger and richer 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.850
 as if 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:35.580
 here come the young branches below 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.979
 nutrients that go on 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.550
 the old will now go to little two 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.550
 these branches 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:07.740
 you can see its young branch on 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:11.420
 compared to the one that already dolls and not 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.420
 knows three or four years 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.100
 that is, those branches that year 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.650
 grown we leave them all branches 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.670
 which here two can leave they still 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.930
 will bear fruit 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:39.170
 and those for which for many years they just 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:42.940
 no need only in vain juices 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:46.960
 take so we give opportunity 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.960
 the bush grow bigger 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:36.239
 so we discharged discharged our 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:40.489
 bush he became smaller and now more 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.489
 opportunities to grow and young branches 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:50.090
 watch my video try 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.410
 your harvest will be more all bye
