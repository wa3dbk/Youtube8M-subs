you'd<00:01:11.789> have<00:01:11.969> to<00:01:12.090> imagine<00:01:13.159> okay<00:01:14.960> well<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:15.990> think

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
you'd have to imagine okay well I think

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.060 
you'd have to imagine okay well I think
they're<00:01:16.590> like<00:01:16.859> supra<00:01:17.460> rims<00:01:18.499> but<00:01:19.499> that<00:01:19.710> centre

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
they're like supra rims but that centre

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.139 
they're like supra rims but that centre
is<00:01:20.189> most<00:01:20.429> definitely<00:01:20.609> a<00:01:22.729> most<00:01:23.729> definitely

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149 
is most definitely a most definitely

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:30.499 
is most definitely a most definitely
belongs<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.719> Sora<00:01:27.799> okay<00:01:28.799> so<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:30.270> can<00:01:30.390> see

00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:32.999 
it's a bit grimy but otherwise it's in

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:34.429
