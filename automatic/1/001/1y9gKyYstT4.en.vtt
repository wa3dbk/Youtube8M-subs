00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.219
 [music] 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.410
 Hello everyone, aurum 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.060
 and in this video I will show you two attacks 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.689
 air so mix this hounds 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:26.739
 and the balls and start with the first attack I 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:28.960
 soak the enemy clan caste by 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:31.899
 the fact that I throw two balls on these 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.570
 guns why exactly because because 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:38.559
 it seemed to me it seemed right 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.720
 what's up these balls dastan only wizard 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.640
 and nothing but this one 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.040
 worried that somewhere here might be 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.070
 air bombs but air bombs 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.380
 turned out as we will see next and 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.990
 with the help of literally two balls coming out 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.660
 the whole fortress and all that remains for me 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:59.610
 do it with the help of onion bows which 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:02.590
 I took in the amount of 10 pieces I grouped 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.370
 all and enemy units into one big 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.680
 a bunch 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.939
 these two mages have long disobeyed you 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:12.400
 could not come together all together but in the end 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.259
 all converge into one big group of 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.840
 all I have to do is quit 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:22.119
 one ball and one ball everything is solved 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.659
 farther the whole tactic is 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:28.299
 to throw away 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.909
 balls in groups on all protective 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:33.210
 constructions here are three defenses 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:36.310
 which I wanted to throw 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.829
 balls of course here for the last 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.380
 I threw out a little splash that's all 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:43.659
 case though it could have been smarter there by 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.539
 several balls there all calculate but 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:51.399
 something somehow i didn't bother here too 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:54.369
 already balls with regge go into the center of the base and 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:56.799
 begin to destroy the very middle 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:00.069
 that is, the main focus was to 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:03.279
 to destroy the middle but those balls 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:07.359
 who came from the right of the left 

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:10.929
 extreme flanks still destroyed me here 

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:13.150
 tower of magicians and here almost destroyed 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.220
 tower of magicians naturally and never 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.650
 completely perfect and because read 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.550
 here and and business fashion was absolutely 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.970
 impossible but 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.100
 i kept the king at the end and the king 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.250
 which one just saw destroyed 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.300
 The last tower of magicians is the most ridiculous 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.030
 such 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.560
 and the bitter situation is what if 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.830
 take a closer look here this flying 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.570
 piggy she survived and deprived me 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.990
 opportunities to use her 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:45.170
 offspring that is she did not explode and 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:49.280
 such a fat helpless cow flies 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:51.950
 across the whole base we don’t matter everything turned out 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.920
 just wonderful it did not bother me 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.730
 get your 3 stars and one hundred percent 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.100
 so 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.590
 attack in general succeeded the second attack 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.380
 was carried out on even more 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.030
 cute 9 tons finger cute in 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.130
 that sense was interesting 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.740
 think over the same way it 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.890
 attack began with the fact that I did not 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:15.110
 completely understood where to throw me 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.440
 balls to lure clan 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:21.320
 fortress here if not look everywhere 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:25.520
 under attack rdf hell that is everywhere here 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:29.030
 for example here can be here and everywhere 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:32.300
 here and rdf and they interfere or rather not 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:35.360
 get in the way but I would have to spend not 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:38.570
 two three balls would have to spend 4 5 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.790
 balls to the whole entire clan 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.380
 the fortress came out and another very important 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.260
 The moment and how this attack was carried out 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:48.680
 here you can see the third number 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:51.260
 then I understood well, this attack was carried out 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.120
 on finishing off, I knew that here 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.360
 clan fortress about planned fortress 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.850
 here 30 bows and 30 bows force 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.270
 get out it's just on the verge of fiction on 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:04.520
 such a base but not the essence, I thought that 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:08.420
 you can try the king and in general 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:11.420
 not mistaken everything happened in the best 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.670
 traditions of clash but because it was 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:17.000
 funny as soon as my king destroyed 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:19.790
 mine and went to the gold vault i 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.400
 engaged his skill and barbarians 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:26.200
 who came out with this skill 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:29.890
 they lured the whole clan sour plus more 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:33.450
 the king warmed up on these bows which 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:36.880
 left the clan fortress after that 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:39.910
 left small business since it is bows 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:43.120
 then without problems they gather in a handful and 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:45.880
 here one ball oh damn not quite 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:50.140
 one ball two balls I destroyed everything 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:52.500
 then I considered where to attack 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:56.170
 and the most ideal option it was 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:58.390
 attack here these three positions yes here here 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.670
 these three positions so i 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:04.390
 planned that the balls are all about stomping 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:07.390
 across the base and completely demolished it I 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:10.360
 and did I squeezed here threw the clan 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.200
 its fortress here and after that still 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.850
 threw away 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:18.010
 hounds here but the balls here of course all 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.110
 normally went on 4 raids only 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.980
 here is the moment after the destruction of this one 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:26.170
 cannon balls and switched to the tower 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:28.360
 archers and then returned center in general 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.910
 started flying all over the base but since i 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.650
 I wanted, in general, and it all came together 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.920
 it’s not always like you 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:38.620
 You understand very rarely can fully 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:42.490
 therefore all their plans to implement 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:44.740
 I am very happy about it and recommend everyone to beat 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:47.440
 it's not really air itself 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.810
 the funniest occupation is me 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:53.110
 now there is of course you can beat overseas 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.750
 The moment itself there is still not over 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.070
 predictable and more accurate in general 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:00.550
 unpredictable for me personally, I tried 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:02.680
 play but may in the future some kind of base 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:06.160
 will come across which will be uncomfortable 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.810
 and for the hounds of balls and I'll beat them 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.930
 necessarily share with those you 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:13.270
 rolls thanks for watching hope
