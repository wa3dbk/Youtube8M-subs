00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:16.170
 us the next video that they 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.360
 I will present is about a supposed UFO 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:23.210
 who descended in front of some deer in 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.210
 Mississippi on February 16, 2014 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.680
 the news says that edil and rainer 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.050
 Charles had installed cameras 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.360
 trail in the Mississippi forest with the 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.880
 hope to take a look at deer 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.830
 and served but after seeing the 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.590
 sequence of images showed what 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:44.380
 for them it looked like it was a UFO 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.720
 the mysterious lights captured by the 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.090
 infrared camera in converse club del 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.760
 jackson county emerge from the 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.400
 darkness and grows gradually until 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.070
 get brighter by pretending to be 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.730
 floating and vanishing from it 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.950
 way they appeared 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.890
 the servants are enlightened by this 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.830
 light and at first sight they look like lanterns of 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.320
 a car but clearly you see that they are 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.330
 above the ground and they ensure 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.850
 that there is no road in the forest 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.330
 that could explain the presence of a 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.330
 vehicle 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.869
 many psychologists claim that it is 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.630
 of a UFO descending but we have 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.320
 studied the case and we have a possible 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:32.450
 Explanation 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:34.520
 [Music] 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.920
 to be able to find a possible 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.409
 answer we analyze the sequence of 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.420
 photos shown about this event and 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.400
 We believe we have a possible answer to 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.100
 this mystery 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.710
 [Music] 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.500
 what we analyze is why this light 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.180
 was about the deer and why is 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.830
 light seemed to be floating 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.080
 [Music] 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.690
 a technique that many hunters occupy 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.660
 of deer is that they place two lights or 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.000
 lanterns on each side of the vehicle as 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:06.090
 artificial light immobilize the dam 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.570
 but in many places this technique is 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.570
 illegal 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.250
 this would give us a possible explanation 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.350
 why light is on the 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.700
 deer but the mystery is not yet 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.700
 why it is floating 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.349
 the fact that light seems to be 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:28.360
 floating has a possible answer and 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.640
 is the type of vehicle they use 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.560
 some hunters 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.780
 the vehicles used by the 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.700
 hunters contain a rack of 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.740
 monterÃ­a that is above the 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.590
 vehicle that serves so that 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.140
 hunters go sit outdoors and 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.190
 have more agility and mobility at the time 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.819
 to hunt their prey 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.799
 [Music] 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.139
 Several shelves are placed on these shelves 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.180
 halogens or lanterns that serve to 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:56.420
 give the hunter an advantage over his 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.400
 dam the basics are two lanterns one a 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.170
 each side but they can be more 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.829
 depending on the hunter and his 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.829
 mod cons 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.329
 next I will show you some 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:09.329
 vehicles used for this house 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:24.040
 [Music] 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.470
 that would explain why the lights 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.870
 They appear to be floating and because 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.720
 the reflection points to the camera plus the 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.310
 darkness we can not witness any 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.069
 part of the vehicle 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.470
 in conclusion the light that seems to float 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:41.630
 it could only be a vehicle 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.140
 house and coincidence with or convicts 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:47.390
 reinforces this theory 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.819
 as we said this is a possible 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.530
 explanation about this event at the end 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:56.110
 you are the ones who have the last 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.110
 word judge for yourself 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.560
 I wanted to tell you that I am not in favor 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.570
 of hunting animals since they 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.030
 they deserve the same respect for life that 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.780
 we have not to hunt for 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:18.050
 animals 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:18.050
