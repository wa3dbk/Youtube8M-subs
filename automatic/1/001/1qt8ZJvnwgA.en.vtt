00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
hey guys what's up just want to show you

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.500 
hey guys what's up just want to show you
a<00:00:02.310> video<00:00:02.520> on<00:00:02.700> a<00:00:02.730> controller<00:00:03.060> that<00:00:03.149> I<00:00:03.330> might

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
a video on a controller that I might

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.639 
a video on a controller that I might
have<00:00:03.600> put<00:00:03.780> Xbox<00:00:04.080> 360<00:00:04.790> here<00:00:05.790> it<00:00:05.910> is<00:00:06.529> looks<00:00:07.529> like

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
have put Xbox 360 here it is looks like

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.100 
have put Xbox 360 here it is looks like
a<00:00:07.680> piece<00:00:07.890> of<00:00:07.919> crap<00:00:08.099> I<00:00:08.250> know<00:00:08.309> but<00:00:08.880> yeah<00:00:09.269> what

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
a piece of crap I know but yeah what

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.600 
a piece of crap I know but yeah what
this<00:00:10.200> controller<00:00:10.530> does<00:00:10.769> is<00:00:10.980> it<00:00:11.130> changes<00:00:11.519> the

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
this controller does is it changes the

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.999 
this controller does is it changes the
control<00:00:11.940> layout<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.929> normal<00:00:13.320> settings<00:00:13.590> normal

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
control layout to normal settings normal

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.150 
control layout to normal settings normal
default<00:00:14.250> controls<00:00:14.519> we're<00:00:15.830> using<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.010> left

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
default controls we're using the left

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.650 
default controls we're using the left
hand<00:00:17.279> on<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.460> move<00:00:17.670> sideways<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.510> right

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
hand on the move sideways and the right

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.260 
hand on the move sideways and the right
analog<00:00:18.869> turns<00:00:19.199> left<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.039> right<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.000> control

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
analog turns left the right to a control

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.599 
analog turns left the right to a control
stick<00:00:21.539> called<00:00:21.720> legacy<00:00:22.170> what<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:23.580> it

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
stick called legacy what that is is it

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.519 
stick called legacy what that is is it
essentially<00:00:24.330> reverses<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.019> rules<00:00:25.230> for<00:00:25.320> this

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
essentially reverses the rules for this

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.070 
essentially reverses the rules for this
so<00:00:26.099> if<00:00:26.250> you're<00:00:26.490> old<00:00:27.359> school<00:00:27.449> gamer<00:00:27.810> like

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
so if you're old school gamer like

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.890 
so if you're old school gamer like
myself<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.400> play<00:00:29.580> say<00:00:30.420> you<00:00:30.480> played<00:00:30.720> on

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
myself and you play say you played on

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.560 
myself and you play say you played on
halo<00:00:31.260> with<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.590> settings<00:00:32.250> or<00:00:32.369> so<00:00:32.489> look<00:00:33.450> under

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
halo with that settings or so look under

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.090 
halo with that settings or so look under
the<00:00:33.719> control<00:00:34.050> scheme<00:00:34.170> Paul<00:00:34.410> legacy<00:00:34.800> you'll

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
the control scheme Paul legacy you'll

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.440 
the control scheme Paul legacy you'll
definitely<00:00:35.520> know<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.910> will<00:00:36.090> tell<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.390> exactly

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
definitely know it will tell you exactly

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.770 
definitely know it will tell you exactly
what<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:36.899> means<00:00:37.610> as<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:39.090> matter<00:00:39.360> fact<00:00:39.390> give<00:00:39.690> me

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
what it means as a matter fact give me

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.720 
what it means as a matter fact give me
one<00:00:40.050> second<00:00:40.530> while<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:40.710> show<00:00:40.920> you<00:00:40.980> an<00:00:41.100> example

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.569 

so<00:00:44.730> looking<00:00:45.090> at<00:00:45.180> this<00:00:45.329> right<00:00:45.510> now<00:00:46.309> this<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.460> the

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
so looking at this right now this is the

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.459 
so looking at this right now this is the
normal<00:00:47.760> layout<00:00:48.480> right<00:00:48.629> here<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.320> you're

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
normal layout right here so you're

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.260 
normal layout right here so you're
moving<00:00:49.559> left<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:49.920> right<00:00:50.010> walk<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.850> forward<00:00:51.030> and

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
moving left to right walk it forward and

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.119 
moving left to right walk it forward and
this<00:00:51.960> on<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.289> right<00:00:52.440> analog<00:00:52.680> stick<00:00:52.800> is

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
this on the right analog stick is

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.590 
this on the right analog stick is
turning<00:00:53.550> left<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.820> right<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.120> looking<00:00:54.510> up

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
turning left and right and looking up

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.889 
turning left and right and looking up
and<00:00:54.750> down<00:00:55.940> this<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.239> switch<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.660> made

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
and down this is the switch that I made

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.889 
and down this is the switch that I made
for<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.440> reverse<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.859> roles<00:00:59.149> so<00:01:00.149> if<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.449> so

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
for it to reverse the roles so if I so

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.080 
for it to reverse the roles so if I so
right<00:01:01.079> now<00:01:01.109> this<00:01:01.440> switches<00:01:01.770> up<00:01:01.920> if<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.789> switch

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
right now this switches up if I switch

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:10.670 
right now this switches up if I switch
them<00:01:03.239> down<00:01:08.750> this<00:01:09.750> essentially<00:01:10.140> turns<00:01:10.470> this

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
them down this essentially turns this

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.560 
them down this essentially turns this
into<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:11.070> control<00:01:11.610> scheme<00:01:11.820> like<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.090> said<00:01:12.210> cold

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
into a control scheme like I said cold

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.840 
into a control scheme like I said cold
and<00:01:12.689> legacy<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.710> instead<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.369> left<00:01:14.580> the

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
and legacy so instead of the left the

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.490 
and legacy so instead of the left the
left<00:01:14.880> analog<00:01:15.299> moving<00:01:15.869> left<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.080> right<00:01:16.140> it's

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
left analog moving left to right it's

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.380 
left analog moving left to right it's
going<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.799> turn<00:01:16.950> instead<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.549> vice<00:01:17.850> versa<00:01:18.090> put

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
going to turn instead and vice versa put

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.120 
going to turn instead and vice versa put
all<00:01:18.509> right<00:01:18.780> analog<00:01:19.049> stick<00:01:19.080> which<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.979> move

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
all right analog stick which is the move

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.350 
all right analog stick which is the move
left<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.369> right<00:01:22.369> so<00:01:23.369> right<00:01:23.640> now<00:01:23.700> here's<00:01:24.270> a

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
left and right so right now here's a

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.859 
left and right so right now here's a
good<00:01:24.509> example<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:26.210> as<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.299> see<00:01:27.450> I'm<00:01:27.570> using<00:01:27.600> the

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
good example so as you see I'm using the

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.510 
good example so as you see I'm using the
left<00:01:28.020> analog<00:01:28.170> stick<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.770> turn<00:01:28.950> let<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.310> right

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
left analog stick to turn let the right

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.490 
left analog stick to turn let the right
and<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:30.509> right<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.869> i'll<00:01:30.960> stick<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.259> move

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
and the right and i'll stick to move

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.280 
and the right and i'll stick to move
side<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.740> side

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.200 

so<00:01:38.920> as<00:01:39.160> you<00:01:39.190> like<00:01:39.460> i<00:01:39.550> said<00:01:39.730> if<00:01:39.850> you're<00:01:39.970> an<00:01:40.090> old

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
so as you like i said if you're an old

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.720 
so as you like i said if you're an old
school<00:01:40.360> gamer<00:01:40.540> like<00:01:40.900> myself<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:42.340> play<00:01:42.520> under

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:42.730 
school gamer like myself you play under

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:43.980 
school gamer like myself you play under
these<00:01:42.850> controls<00:01:43.210> if<00:01:43.450> you're<00:01:43.600> familiar<00:01:43.750> with

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
these controls if you're familiar with

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.220 
these controls if you're familiar with
saying<00:01:44.560> goldeneye<00:01:45.070> for<00:01:45.340> the<00:01:45.850> n64<00:01:46.180> this<00:01:47.050> is

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.230 
saying goldeneye for the n64 this is

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.830 
saying goldeneye for the n64 this is
essentially<00:01:48.190> the<00:01:48.280> same<00:01:48.400> controls<00:01:48.840> moving

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
essentially the same controls moving

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.840 
essentially the same controls moving
side<00:01:49.990> to<00:01:50.020> side<00:01:50.170> with<00:01:50.470> the<00:01:50.620> right<00:01:50.830> analog<00:01:51.040> or<00:01:51.370> it

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
side to side with the right analog or it

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.330 
side to side with the right analog or it
was<00:01:52.720> for<00:01:53.470> buns<00:01:53.710> on<00:01:53.830> the<00:01:53.860> left<00:01:54.070> on<00:01:54.220> the<00:01:54.250> right

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
was for buns on the left on the right

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.910
