00:00:02.709 --> 00:00:04.929 
hey guys it's joe from pocketnow.com
what<00:00:03.709> would<00:00:03.830> have<00:00:03.919> happened<00:00:04.279> if<00:00:04.399> we<00:00:04.790> would

00:00:04.929 --> 00:00:04.939 
what would have happened if we would

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:07.179 
what would have happened if we would
have<00:00:05.000> skipped<00:00:05.359> from<00:00:05.569> desktop<00:00:06.259> computers<00:00:06.290> or

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:07.189 
have skipped from desktop computers or

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:09.700 
have skipped from desktop computers or
laptop<00:00:07.729> computers<00:00:08.179> straight<00:00:08.900> to<00:00:09.110> smartphones

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:09.710 
laptop computers straight to smartphones

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.169 
laptop computers straight to smartphones
so<00:00:10.099> we<00:00:10.219> didn't<00:00:10.429> even<00:00:10.490> have<00:00:10.759> the<00:00:10.940> bigger

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:11.179 
so we didn't even have the bigger

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:13.629 
so we didn't even have the bigger
versions<00:00:11.750> of<00:00:11.929> these<00:00:12.460> computers<00:00:13.460> because

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:13.639 
versions of these computers because

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:14.650 
versions of these computers because
really<00:00:13.820> that's<00:00:14.030> what<00:00:14.240> a<00:00:14.269> modern<00:00:14.480> smartphone

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
really that's what a modern smartphone

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.590 
really that's what a modern smartphone
is<00:00:15.309> what<00:00:16.309> kind<00:00:16.520> of<00:00:16.580> keyboard<00:00:16.820> would<00:00:17.330> we<00:00:17.449> have

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
is what kind of keyboard would we have

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.279 
is what kind of keyboard would we have
put<00:00:17.869> on<00:00:18.140> a<00:00:18.439> smartphone<00:00:19.340> well<00:00:20.150> the<00:00:21.080> guys<00:00:21.260> at

put on a smartphone well the guys at

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:23.410 
put on a smartphone well the guys at

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
says what would have happened if we were

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.060 
says what would have happened if we were
designing<00:00:46.190> a<00:00:46.990> keyboard<00:00:47.990> for<00:00:48.590> a<00:00:48.650> mobile<00:00:48.920> device

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
designing a keyboard for a mobile device

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.210 
designing a keyboard for a mobile device
and<00:00:49.640> we<00:00:50.180> weren't<00:00:50.390> biased<00:00:51.020> by<00:00:51.260> keyboards<00:00:52.010> that

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220 
and we weren't biased by keyboards that

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.610 
and we weren't biased by keyboards that
were<00:00:52.730> on<00:00:52.880> well<00:00:53.120> originally<00:00:53.750> typewriters<00:00:54.470> and

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
were on well originally typewriters and

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.860 
were on well originally typewriters and
then<00:00:55.160> have<00:00:55.370> been<00:00:55.490> moved<00:00:55.730> over<00:00:55.880> to<00:00:56.150> desktop

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
then have been moved over to desktop

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.720 
then have been moved over to desktop
computers<00:00:57.350> laptops<00:00:57.770> and<00:00:57.980> then<00:00:58.070> well<00:00:58.430> even

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
computers laptops and then well even

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.390 
computers laptops and then well even
eventually<00:00:58.940> on<00:00:59.750> to<00:01:00.230> mobile<00:01:01.220> devices

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:01.400 
eventually on to mobile devices

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.670 
eventually on to mobile devices
themselves<00:01:01.790> via<00:01:02.390> a<00:01:02.480> slide-out<00:01:02.840> keyboard<00:01:03.200> and

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
themselves via a slide-out keyboard and

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.630 
themselves via a slide-out keyboard and
then<00:01:04.400> by<00:01:04.820> extension<00:01:04.970> a<00:01:05.950> little<00:01:06.950> soft<00:01:07.250> input

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
then by extension a little soft input

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.700 
then by extension a little soft input
panel<00:01:07.850> or<00:01:08.120> that<00:01:08.270> IME<00:01:08.840> well<00:01:09.350> what<00:01:09.530> would<00:01:09.680> that

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
panel or that IME well what would that

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.020 
panel or that IME well what would that
have<00:01:09.920> looked<00:01:10.100> like<00:01:10.160> this<00:01:10.280> is<00:01:10.580> what<00:01:10.730> they<00:01:10.850> came

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
have looked like this is what they came

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.940 
have looked like this is what they came
up<00:01:11.090> with<00:01:11.240> what<00:01:12.050> it<00:01:12.140> is<00:01:12.170> is<00:01:12.530> it's<00:01:12.710> four

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
up with what it is is it's four

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.510 
up with what it is is it's four
quadrants<00:01:13.490> with<00:01:13.850> a<00:01:13.880> dot<00:01:14.210> and<00:01:14.480> I<00:01:15.440> mean<00:01:16.370> that's

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
quadrants with a dot and I mean that's

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.820 
quadrants with a dot and I mean that's
as<00:01:16.670> basic<00:01:17.030> as<00:01:17.180> it<00:01:17.300> gets<00:01:17.360> what<00:01:18.200> they've<00:01:18.380> done<00:01:18.590> is

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
as basic as it gets what they've done is

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.590 
as basic as it gets what they've done is
they've<00:01:19.010> aligned<00:01:19.460> all<00:01:19.730> the<00:01:19.940> letters<00:01:20.210> on<00:01:20.390> the

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
they've aligned all the letters on the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.580 
they've aligned all the letters on the
keyboard<00:01:20.890> around<00:01:21.890> these<00:01:22.280> rays<00:01:22.670> and<00:01:23.590> they've

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
keyboard around these rays and they've

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.050 
keyboard around these rays and they've
arranged<00:01:25.190> them<00:01:25.340> such<00:01:25.580> that<00:01:25.610> the<00:01:25.820> more

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
arranged them such that the more

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.730 
arranged them such that the more
frequently<00:01:26.540> used<00:01:26.750> ones<00:01:26.990> are<00:01:27.170> closer<00:01:27.470> to<00:01:27.650> the

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
frequently used ones are closer to the

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.200 
frequently used ones are closer to the
center<00:01:28.040> and<00:01:28.130> the<00:01:28.190> last<00:01:28.370> frequently<00:01:28.820> we<00:01:28.970> use

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
center and the last frequently we use

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.899 
center and the last frequently we use
ones<00:01:29.659> are<00:01:29.810> closer<00:01:30.200> to<00:01:30.380> the<00:01:30.470> outside<00:01:30.860> and<00:01:31.159> the

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
ones are closer to the outside and the

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:33.730 
ones are closer to the outside and the
way<00:01:32.060> that<00:01:32.240> you<00:01:32.300> input<00:01:32.510> text<00:01:33.050> is<00:01:33.140> you<00:01:33.260> start<00:01:33.560> in

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
way that you input text is you start in

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.880 
way that you input text is you start in
the<00:01:33.860> middle<00:01:33.980> and<00:01:34.250> if<00:01:35.210> you<00:01:35.470> move<00:01:36.470> your<00:01:36.650> finger

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
the middle and if you move your finger

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.649 
the middle and if you move your finger
into<00:01:37.159> whatever<00:01:37.340> quadrant<00:01:38.000> your<00:01:38.120> letters<00:01:38.450> in

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
into whatever quadrant your letters in

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.810 
into whatever quadrant your letters in
so<00:01:39.260> if<00:01:39.350> I<00:01:39.440> wanted<00:01:39.800> an<00:01:39.890> H<00:01:40.130> that's<00:01:40.460> down<00:01:40.670> there

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
so if I wanted an H that's down there

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.460 
so if I wanted an H that's down there
I'd<00:01:40.970> move<00:01:41.180> my<00:01:41.330> finger<00:01:41.630> down<00:01:41.780> into<00:01:42.140> that

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
I'd move my finger down into that

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.310 
I'd move my finger down into that
quadrant<00:01:43.040> but<00:01:43.760> then<00:01:43.970> I<00:01:44.000> have<00:01:44.300> to<00:01:44.540> tell<00:01:44.840> it<00:01:44.990> you

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
quadrant but then I have to tell it you

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.930 
quadrant but then I have to tell it you
know<00:01:45.440> what<00:01:45.680> is<00:01:45.800> it<00:01:45.950> is<00:01:46.100> it<00:01:46.250> one<00:01:46.430> of<00:01:46.460> those<00:01:46.729> guys

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
know what is it is it one of those guys

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.719 
know what is it is it one of those guys
or<00:01:47.210> one<00:01:47.300> of<00:01:47.390> those<00:01:47.540> guys<00:01:47.750> well<00:01:48.530> to<00:01:48.800> do<00:01:49.010> that<00:01:49.040> if

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
or one of those guys well to do that if

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.610 
or one of those guys well to do that if
I<00:01:49.880> want<00:01:50.090> one<00:01:50.270> of<00:01:50.330> these<00:01:50.540> letters<00:01:50.810> I<00:01:51.050> move<00:01:51.409> my

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
I want one of these letters I move my

what was the form factor that we started

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.360 
what was the form factor that we started
with<00:05:23.389> kind<00:05:23.960> of<00:05:24.080> a<00:05:24.169> neat<00:05:24.320> idea<00:05:24.350> I<00:05:24.710> really<00:05:25.220> have

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
with kind of a neat idea I really have

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.820 
with kind of a neat idea I really have
to<00:05:25.520> give<00:05:25.699> the<00:05:25.880> developers<00:05:26.330> credit<00:05:26.720> for<00:05:26.990> coming

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
to give the developers credit for coming

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.379 
to give the developers credit for coming
up<00:05:28.010> with<00:05:28.160> such<00:05:28.280> a<00:05:28.310> radical<00:05:28.789> concept<00:05:28.940> that

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389 
up with such a radical concept that

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:32.230 
up with such a radical concept that
really<00:05:29.780> is<00:05:29.979> relatively<00:05:30.979> fluid<00:05:31.220> but<00:05:31.970> a<00:05:32.000> little

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
really is relatively fluid but a little

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.850 
really is relatively fluid but a little
bit<00:05:32.360> frustrating<00:05:33.080> at<00:05:33.169> time<00:05:33.380> is<00:05:33.620> simply

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
bit frustrating at time is simply

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.529 
bit frustrating at time is simply
because<00:05:34.099> I<00:05:34.460> haven't<00:05:34.700> used<00:05:35.000> it<00:05:35.150> all<00:05:35.270> that<00:05:35.419> much

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:35.539 
because I haven't used it all that much

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:37.300 
because I haven't used it all that much
and<00:05:35.810> when<00:05:36.169> I<00:05:36.200> say<00:05:36.440> haven't<00:05:36.680> used<00:05:36.889> it<00:05:37.010> that<00:05:37.160> much

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
and when I say haven't used it that much

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.670 
and when I say haven't used it that much

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:46.039 
to use it for two days solid so it's not

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:48.040 
to use it for two days solid so it's not
for<00:05:46.250> lack<00:05:46.400> of<00:05:46.460> actually<00:05:47.330> using<00:05:47.690> it<00:05:47.780> it's<00:05:47.900> just
