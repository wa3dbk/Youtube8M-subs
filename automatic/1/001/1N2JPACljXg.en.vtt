00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.860
 our shot of automatons 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:02.030
 we mix everything with a wooden spoon 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.470
 then we will simmer on low heat 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.730
 for two hours with the lid 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.330

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:22.790
 at that moment we go now 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:24.319
 go to the lasagna setting so for 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.239
 the lasagna leaves you can 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.670
