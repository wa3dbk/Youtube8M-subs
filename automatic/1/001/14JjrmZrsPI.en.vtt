00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:04.170
 Never let me see 

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.100
 Actually, that side, I am chasing you. 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.800
 Such as the trapped inside the avatar 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.660
 Eyebrows turn the earthquake day 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.160
 No volts make me flustered 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.270
 Half open and half cover like a hidden paradise 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.770
 I want to discover the gradual debunking every day. 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:38.250
 Let your bizarre freshness leave me ready to discover 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:45.850
 Having swiftly swept through the subtle fragments in my thoughts 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:53.680
 How to change the role or see your innocent face 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:00.240

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.190
 Chasing your erratic face 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.720
 Never let me see 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.440
 Actually, that side, I am chasing you. 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.290
 I still want to hide the paradise, I want to be everyday. 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.130
 Lay out gradually 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.790
 Let your bizarre freshness leave me ready to discover 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:39.320
 Having swiftly swept through the subtle fragments in my thoughts 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:47.410
 How to change the role or see your innocent face 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.810
 I met this moment in this life of romance. 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.810
 Chasing your erratic face 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:17.160
 Let your bizarre freshness leave me ready to discover 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:24.840
 Having swiftly swept through the subtle fragments in my thoughts 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:32.640
 How to change the role or see your innocent face 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:39.200
 I met this moment in this life of romance. 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.500
 Chasing your erratic face
