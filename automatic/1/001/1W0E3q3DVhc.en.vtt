one's<00:00:21.800> secure<00:00:22.280> this<00:00:22.850> one<00:00:23.030> have<00:00:23.210> screws<00:00:24.160> here

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
one's secure this one have screws here

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.490 
one's secure this one have screws here
and<00:00:25.400> here<00:00:25.760> which<00:00:25.940> you<00:00:26.090> could<00:00:26.240> tighten<00:00:26.510> up<00:00:26.720> if

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
and here which you could tighten up if

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.740 
and here which you could tighten up if
it<00:00:27.800> was<00:00:27.920> loose<00:00:28.190> also<00:00:29.029> another<00:00:29.330> thing<00:00:29.600> to

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
it was loose also another thing to

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.330 
it was loose also another thing to
tighten<00:00:30.080> them<00:00:30.199> up<00:00:30.320> would<00:00:30.529> work<00:00:30.680> real<00:00:30.980> good<00:00:31.010> as

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
tighten them up would work real good as

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.069 
tighten them up would work real good as
a<00:00:31.369> metal<00:00:31.789> bracket<00:00:32.270> you<00:00:32.359> could<00:00:32.509> add<00:00:32.660> one<00:00:32.899> in

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
a metal bracket you could add one in

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:34.509 
a metal bracket you could add one in
here<00:00:33.379> you<00:00:33.500> could<00:00:33.620> paint<00:00:33.829> it<00:00:33.920> the<00:00:34.039> same<00:00:34.250> color

00:00:34.509 --> 00:00:34.519 
here you could paint it the same color

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:37.329 
here you could paint it the same color
but<00:00:35.149> that<00:00:35.359> would<00:00:35.539> make<00:00:35.719> a<00:00:35.749> very<00:00:36.019> very<00:00:36.710> secure

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:37.339 
but that would make a very very secure

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:39.700 
but that would make a very very secure
thing<00:00:37.749> connections<00:00:38.749> a<00:00:38.899> metal<00:00:39.140> bracket<00:00:39.350> like

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
thing connections a metal bracket like

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.279 
thing connections a metal bracket like
this<00:00:40.039> flat<00:00:40.729> metal<00:00:40.999> and<00:00:41.539> we<00:00:41.719> put<00:00:41.929> a<00:00:41.960> couple

00:00:42.279 --> 00:00:42.289 
this flat metal and we put a couple

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:44.349 
this flat metal and we put a couple
screws<00:00:42.530> here<00:00:42.859> a<00:00:42.889> couple<00:00:43.100> screws<00:00:43.460> here<00:00:43.760> if<00:00:44.120> you

00:00:44.349 --> 00:00:44.359 
screws here a couple screws here if you

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:47.110 
screws here a couple screws here if you
did<00:00:44.539> have<00:00:44.780> one<00:00:44.989> that<00:00:45.229> was<00:00:45.350> loose<00:00:45.649> so<00:00:46.519> now<00:00:47.059> we

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
did have one that was loose so now we

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.599 
did have one that was loose so now we
have<00:00:47.600> tighten<00:00:48.350> the<00:00:48.440> post<00:00:48.710> up<00:00:49.010> we've<00:00:49.249> tightened

00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:49.609 
have tighten the post up we've tightened

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:53.079 
have tighten the post up we've tightened
the<00:00:49.699> handrail<00:00:50.239> up<00:00:50.479> so<00:00:51.109> we<00:00:51.229> have<00:00:51.379> a<00:00:51.760> secure<00:00:52.760> base

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
the handrail up so we have a secure base

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:58.660 
the handrail up so we have a secure base
for<00:00:54.010> child<00:00:55.010> safety<00:00:55.539> for<00:00:56.539> your<00:00:56.690> pets<00:00:56.989> and<00:00:57.670> for

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
handrail and so the connections here

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.070 
handrail and so the connections here
absolutely<00:01:10.220> critical<00:01:11.210> it<00:01:11.330> be<00:01:11.480> good<00:01:11.660> and<00:01:11.810> firm

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
make them look good we've got to make

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.660 
make them look good we've got to make
sure<00:01:20.330> there's<00:01:20.510> a<00:01:20.600> screw<00:01:21.020> in<00:01:21.260> there<00:01:21.530> not<00:01:22.250> even<00:01:22.580> a

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
nail nails can loosen too easily so we

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.770 
nail nails can loosen too easily so we
make<00:01:25.310> sure<00:01:25.340> there's<00:01:25.670> screws<00:01:26.060> in<00:01:26.330> there<00:01:26.510> and

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
make sure there's screws in there and

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.620 
make sure there's screws in there and
that<00:01:27.380> they're<00:01:27.560> snug<00:01:27.950> and<00:01:28.280> adequate<00:01:29.030> in<00:01:29.420> the

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
that they're snug and adequate in the

the wood around them has not split and

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.920 
the wood around them has not split and
that<00:01:34.370> way<00:01:34.550> we'll<00:01:34.730> have<00:01:34.820> a<00:01:34.880> nice<00:01:35.090> safe<00:01:35.390> handrail

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
that way we'll have a nice safe handrail

a safe deck and that's only probably one

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.430 
a safe deck and that's only probably one
of<00:01:38.180> the<00:01:38.270> most<00:01:38.450> important<00:01:39.020> things<00:01:39.170> in

fashion<00:01:53.330> where<00:01:53.750> they<00:01:53.780> nailed<00:01:54.230> them<00:01:54.500> in<00:01:54.740> you

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
fashion where they nailed them in you

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.010 
fashion where they nailed them in you
can<00:01:55.370> try<00:01:55.580> tightening<00:01:56.090> them<00:01:56.180> up<00:01:56.330> but<00:01:56.659> they<00:01:56.840> will

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
can try tightening them up but they will

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.140 
can try tightening them up but they will
loosen<00:01:57.230> again<00:01:57.620> very<00:01:57.830> quickly<00:01:58.130> I<00:01:58.460> would<00:01:58.909> put

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
loosen again very quickly I would put

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.120 
loosen again very quickly I would put
lag<00:01:59.420> bolts<00:01:59.840> in<00:02:00.020> if<00:02:00.170> that<00:02:00.320> was<00:02:00.500> the<00:02:00.620> case<00:02:00.800> in

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
lag bolts in if that was the case in

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.610 
lag bolts in if that was the case in
this<00:02:01.640> case<00:02:01.940> we<00:02:02.270> have<00:02:02.479> carriage<00:02:03.050> bolts<00:02:03.409> that<00:02:03.500> go

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
this case we have carriage bolts that go

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.890 
this case we have carriage bolts that go
right<00:02:03.830> through<00:02:04.010> with<00:02:04.220> a<00:02:04.250> nut<00:02:04.550> on<00:02:04.580> the<00:02:04.850> back<00:02:05.090> so

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
right through with a nut on the back so

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.840 
right through with a nut on the back so
we<00:02:06.050> can<00:02:06.200> go<00:02:06.320> down<00:02:06.350> and<00:02:06.710> check<00:02:06.920> the<00:02:06.950> knot<00:02:07.340> this

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
we can go down and check the knot this

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.330 
we can go down and check the knot this
one's<00:02:08.090> a<00:02:08.239> little<00:02:08.360> loose<00:02:08.679> snug<00:02:09.679> it<00:02:09.860> up<00:02:09.920> by<00:02:10.310> hand

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
one's a little loose snug it up by hand

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.089 
one's a little loose snug it up by hand
and<00:02:10.819> then<00:02:10.909> we'll<00:02:11.269> take<00:02:11.450> a<00:02:11.480> wrench<00:02:11.749> and<00:02:12.099> we'll

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
and then we'll take a wrench and we'll

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.309 
and then we'll take a wrench and we'll
we'll<00:02:13.549> tighten<00:02:13.790> it<00:02:13.939> down<00:02:14.030> now<00:02:14.480> we<00:02:14.959> want<00:02:15.139> to<00:02:15.230> get

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
we'll tighten it down now we want to get

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:16.300 
we'll tighten it down now we want to get
a<00:02:15.349> good<00:02:15.590> and<00:02:15.739> snug<00:02:15.980> but

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
a good and snug but

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.589 
a good and snug but
you<00:02:16.459> don't<00:02:16.610> want<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:16.819> go<00:02:16.910> to<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.120> place<00:02:17.360> where

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
you don't want to go to the place where

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.870 
you don't want to go to the place where
the<00:02:17.690> wood<00:02:17.840> starts<00:02:18.170> crunching<00:02:18.590> because<00:02:19.310> you're

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
the wood starts crunching because you're

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.490 
the wood starts crunching because you're
just<00:02:20.060> crushing<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.660> wood<00:02:20.840> it<00:02:21.020> could<00:02:21.170> loosen

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
just crushing the wood it could loosen

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.850 
just crushing the wood it could loosen
up<00:02:21.680> again<00:02:21.980> so<00:02:22.670> what<00:02:23.300> I'll<00:02:23.420> do<00:02:23.599> is<00:02:23.630> tighten<00:02:24.590> this

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
up again so what I'll do is tighten this

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.510 
up again so what I'll do is tighten this
down<00:02:25.180> this<00:02:26.180> one<00:02:26.390> we've<00:02:26.750> got<00:02:26.930> two<00:02:27.110> bolts<00:02:27.530> that

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
down this one we've got two bolts that

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.930 
down this one we've got two bolts that
looks<00:02:28.790> snug<00:02:29.060> already<00:02:29.680> so<00:02:30.680> we<00:02:30.800> just<00:02:30.980> we<00:02:31.489> snug<00:02:31.819> it

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
looks snug already so we just we snug it

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.300 
looks snug already so we just we snug it
down<00:02:31.970> to<00:02:32.360> a<00:02:32.620> good<00:02:33.620> amount<00:02:33.920> I<00:02:34.099> measure

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
down to a good amount I measure

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.040 
down to a good amount I measure
measuring<00:02:34.880> foot<00:02:35.090> pounds<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:35.510> just<00:02:35.569> I<00:02:35.720> pushed

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
measuring foot pounds and just I pushed

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.110 
measuring foot pounds and just I pushed
on<00:02:36.230> that<00:02:36.410> pretty<00:02:36.680> hard<00:02:36.890> in<00:02:37.130> it's<00:02:37.340> tight<00:02:37.580> that

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
on that pretty hard in it's tight that

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.449 
on that pretty hard in it's tight that
will<00:02:38.420> that<00:02:38.840> will<00:02:39.050> tighten<00:02:39.319> this<00:02:39.560> up<00:02:39.800> you<00:02:40.430> might
