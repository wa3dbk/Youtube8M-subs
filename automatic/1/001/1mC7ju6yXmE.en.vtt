00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.040
 The basic producer of this episode brings you: 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.510
 gear! 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:07.349
 Gear envy... (sigh) 

00:00:15.371 --> 00:00:22.420
 I got a lot of questions, what kind of lens should I get, how should I go so expensive, what? 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.289
 The next biggest camera, my voice... 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.180
 These are all legitimate questions, and I love to answer them. 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.550
 But in most of the main components of the video I was asked to see: 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.690
 s story. 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.850
 You can make a great movie, shoot and have a lot of sound, with great special effects, 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.089
 And put it there, but if you don't have the story - it's the foundation, it's all 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:47.100
 Fall. 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.620
 The writer writes, the painter's paint, and the director's film, over and over, over and over again 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.639
 And above, to get better. 

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:59.089
 Ok, as much as possible the main foundation or component in your movie, everything will fall 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:00.889
 A good story. 

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:03.679
 This is what you should practice. 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:08.220
 Grab an iPhone, grab a good story, and shoot. 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.980
 This will be even more compelling to watch, with $500,000 more than gears. 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.820
 Shoot and have a lame story. 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.440
 Now, what is a good story? 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.150
 This is a matter of opinion. 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.400
 But here is what I know: 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:29.400
 A little good movie, good story, a little good voice, always like it, 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.650
 The lame story, no matter what you shot, no. 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.750
 If you want someone else to like what you are doing, this is a way to make it 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.060
 Movie, your story. 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.730
 Write over and over again, over and over again. 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.760
 Movie, shoot it, it's released. 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.760
 Write another. 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.970
 Movie, shoot it, it's released. 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:47.750
 Write another. 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.230
 Movie, shoot it, it's released. 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.220
 You will only get better. 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.010
 But I can tell you, if you donâ€™t practice writing stories, the cornerstone of everything. 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.140
 You do, this is not going to get better without the equipment you get. 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.650
 of course. 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.940
 A couple of guys in an alley, battle scenes, wow, this is great, you took a battle scene, 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.769
 This is an awesome, good battle scene. 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:11.379
 However, there are no stories. 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.859
 There are two people fighting, you show your seal, how can you do special effects? 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:15.730
 Cut things. 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.749
 This is great, and there is nothing wrong with it. This is also the rule. 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:21.689
 But the work you need for something is your story. 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:22.829
 Wrote a lot of stories. 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:27.370
 Just keep writing them over and over again, and the photographer, you want 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.560
 become better. 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.209
 It doesn't matter what kind of equipment you have. 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:38.129
 In the end, when your technical ability gets to the point, it runs to your 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:39.239
 The story is for sure. 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:40.489
 Go buy a better lens. 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:41.969
 Go buy a better camera. 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:44.209
 Go get some more lighting. 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:45.749
 But the place is going to fail this story. 

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:50.749
 Don't go out and spend $10,000 on equipment if you can't write a story. 

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:55.989
 Save your money, practice writing stories, when you get it really good, then go 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.569
 Buying equipment, you will be a lot more happy this way. 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:00.310
 I hope to help. 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.269
 thanks for watching. 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.300
 Guy (laughs) This is a wrap! 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:16.049
 (dog barking) 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.900
 I have such a dog there, and for some reason, the dog is just... arrogant... particles in the air. 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.279
 (dog barking) 

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:25.040
 Title: "The day after..." 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:38.000
 "We heard the dog still yelling, we FADE TO BLACK."
