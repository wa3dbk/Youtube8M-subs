so the iskin fits quite well its
antimicrobial<00:02:17.060> it<00:02:18.060> does<00:02:18.660> provide<00:02:19.020> a<00:02:19.080> bit<00:02:19.410> more

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
antimicrobial it does provide a bit more

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.640 
antimicrobial it does provide a bit more
tactile<00:02:20.160> feel<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:21.510> I<00:02:21.720> mean<00:02:21.960> it's<00:02:22.170> much<00:02:22.440> like

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
tactile feel to it I mean it's much like

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.000 
tactile feel to it I mean it's much like
the<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:23.070> skin<00:02:23.370> I<00:02:23.400> have<00:02:23.820> on<00:02:24.090> my<00:02:24.510> iphone<00:02:25.010> instead

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
the the skin I have on my iphone instead

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.330 
the the skin I have on my iphone instead
of<00:02:26.130> my<00:02:26.670> phone<00:02:26.700> kind<00:02:27.120> of<00:02:27.150> sliding<00:02:27.450> around<00:02:27.810> it

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
of my phone kind of sliding around it

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.390 
of my phone kind of sliding around it
actually<00:02:29.340> is<00:02:29.880> a<00:02:30.000> piece<00:02:30.330> of<00:02:30.360> plastic<00:02:30.930> that<00:02:31.400> you

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
actually is a piece of plastic that you

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.120 
actually is a piece of plastic that you
know<00:02:32.490> just<00:02:32.670> makes<00:02:33.150> it<00:02:33.330> easier<00:02:33.920> potentially<00:02:34.920> to

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
know just makes it easier potentially to

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.550 
know just makes it easier potentially to
deal<00:02:35.520> with<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:36.570> know<00:02:36.600> if<00:02:36.960> you're<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.380> type<00:02:37.530> of

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
deal with you know if you're the type of

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.130 
deal with you know if you're the type of
person<00:02:37.680> that<00:02:37.890> needs<00:02:38.310> more<00:02:39.000> grip<00:02:39.240> to<00:02:39.990> your

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
person that needs more grip to your

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.960 
person that needs more grip to your
peripherals<00:02:41.010> well<00:02:41.280> then<00:02:41.490> I<00:02:41.520> don't<00:02:41.610> think<00:02:41.880> it

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
peripherals well then I don't think it

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.110 
peripherals well then I don't think it
gets<00:02:42.000> any<00:02:42.240> more<00:02:42.420> grippy<00:02:43.050> than<00:02:43.680> this<00:02:44.340> like<00:02:45.030> I

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
gets any more grippy than this like I

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.840 
gets any more grippy than this like I
said<00:02:45.180> I'm<00:02:45.570> a<00:02:45.660> big<00:02:45.930> mighty<00:02:46.920> mouse<00:02:47.160> fan<00:02:47.490> although

apples keyboards or other keyboards and

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.370 
apples keyboards or other keyboards and
I've<00:04:22.710> never<00:04:22.890> really<00:04:23.250> liked<00:04:23.460> any<00:04:23.640> one<00:04:23.820> of<00:04:23.850> them

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
I've never really liked any one of them

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.320 
I've never really liked any one of them
because<00:04:24.890> they<00:04:25.010> seem<00:04:25.220> to<00:04:25.250> get<00:04:25.490> in<00:04:25.730> the<00:04:25.820> way<00:04:26.030> of

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
because they seem to get in the way of

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.380 
because they seem to get in the way of
what<00:04:27.110> it<00:04:27.380> is<00:04:27.500> that<00:04:27.560> I'm<00:04:28.550> trying<00:04:28.880> to<00:04:29.030> do<00:04:29.180> with

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
what it is that I'm trying to do with

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.110 
what it is that I'm trying to do with
the<00:04:29.480> keyboard<00:04:29.660> and<00:04:30.020> I<00:04:30.290> need<00:04:30.560> direct<00:04:31.400> contact

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
the keyboard and I need direct contact

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.460 
the keyboard and I need direct contact
with<00:04:32.210> the<00:04:32.330> keys<00:04:32.540> on<00:04:32.720> a<00:04:32.750> keyboard<00:04:32.840> in<00:04:33.380> order

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
with the keys on a keyboard in order

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.760 
with the keys on a keyboard in order
like<00:04:33.740> it<00:04:33.920> excite<00:04:34.580> type<00:04:34.820> fast<00:04:35.120> I<00:04:35.390> put<00:04:35.870> my<00:04:36.560> mouse

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
like it excite type fast I put my mouse

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.340 
like it excite type fast I put my mouse
fast<00:04:37.130> too<00:04:37.430> so<00:04:38.000> I<00:04:38.300> think<00:04:38.690> the<00:04:38.870> hallmark<00:04:39.230> of<00:04:39.260> a

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
fast too so I think the hallmark of a

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.350 
fast too so I think the hallmark of a
good<00:04:39.470> skin<00:04:39.770> is<00:04:39.950> that<00:04:40.130> it's<00:04:40.400> there<00:04:40.790> but<00:04:41.300> it's

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360

also out of your way in terms of you

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.090 
also out of your way in terms of you
