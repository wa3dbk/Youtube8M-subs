this is actually the way I recommend
that<00:00:15.929> you<00:00:16.410> progress<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.100> end<00:00:17.250> of<00:00:17.369> the

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
that you progress to the end of the

that you progress to the end of the
level<00:00:17.640> so<00:00:18.000> if<00:00:18.330> you<00:00:18.539> successfully<00:00:18.990> speech

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
level so if you successfully speech

level so if you successfully speech
challenged<00:00:19.980> him<00:00:21.140> go<00:00:22.140> ahead<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.439> turn<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.800> cap

challenged him go ahead and turn the cap
the<00:00:24.350> Quantum's<00:00:25.350> into<00:00:25.650> him<00:00:25.800> you're<00:00:25.949> going<00:00:26.070> to

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
the Quantum's into him you're going to

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.460 
the Quantum's into him you're going to
get<00:00:26.220> 2,400<00:00:27.000> calves<00:00:27.210> which<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.630> nice<00:00:27.900> nice
