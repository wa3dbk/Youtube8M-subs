standard<00:00:33.660> appliances<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:35.070> my<00:00:35.219> suggestion<00:00:35.670> to

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
standard appliances so my suggestion to

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.290 
standard appliances so my suggestion to
you<00:00:36.149> before<00:00:36.630> purchasing<00:00:37.350> would<00:00:37.710> be<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.309> just

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
you before purchasing would be to just

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.410 
you before purchasing would be to just
look<00:00:39.840> at<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.230> space<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:41.010> measure<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.700> where

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
look at the space and measure it where

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.540 
look at the space and measure it where
it's<00:00:42.570> going<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.780> go<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.620> just<00:00:44.040> make<00:00:44.250> sure<00:00:44.399> you

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
it's going to go and just make sure you

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.310 
it's going to go and just make sure you
have<00:00:44.700> enough<00:00:44.910> clearance<00:00:45.239> because<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.870> did<00:00:46.140> have

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
have enough clearance because I did have

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.410 
have enough clearance because I did have
to<00:00:46.500> make<00:00:46.530> some<00:00:46.950> minor<00:00:47.160> modifications<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:48.180> my

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
to make some minor modifications to my

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.950 
to make some minor modifications to my
units<00:00:48.870> just<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.770> allow<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.340> fit<00:00:50.960> nothing

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
units just to allow it to fit nothing

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.389 
units just to allow it to fit nothing
that<00:00:52.410> was<00:00:52.649> too<00:00:53.010> difficult<00:00:54.170> but<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.920> know<00:00:56.100> it

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.470 
will take to dry I don't I find this
this<00:02:58.620> sort<00:02:58.950> of<00:02:59.040> like<00:02:59.340> really<00:02:59.970> nice<00:03:00.120> because<00:03:00.330> I

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
this sort of like really nice because I

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.870 
this sort of like really nice because I
don't<00:03:00.690> have<00:03:00.930> to<00:03:01.140> set<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:01.440> program<00:03:01.950> it<00:03:02.549> sets

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
don't have to set the program it sets

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.289 
don't have to set the program it sets
itself<00:03:03.500> so<00:03:04.500> you're<00:03:04.650> not<00:03:04.860> really<00:03:05.269> overusing

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
itself so you're not really overusing

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.170 
itself so you're not really overusing
energy<00:03:07.069> so<00:03:08.069> I<00:03:08.130> see<00:03:08.340> that<00:03:08.489> as<00:03:08.549> a<00:03:08.640> bit<00:03:08.850> of<00:03:08.940> a<00:03:09.000> money

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
energy so I see that as a bit of a money

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.270 
energy so I see that as a bit of a money
saver<00:03:11.060> in<00:03:12.060> terms<00:03:12.900> of<00:03:13.049> the<00:03:13.140> appliance<00:03:13.650> will

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
saver in terms of the appliance will

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.759 
saver in terms of the appliance will
