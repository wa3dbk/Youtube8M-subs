00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.940
 place mostly my mobile eyelid and what 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.360
 I'm going to blur little by little 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:52.080
 especially my mobile eyelid and a little bit 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.080
 upwards 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:16.069

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.620
 I'm going to place it on my eyelid 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.960
 mobile to taps so there's a lot 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.560
 more intense the shadow 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:27.560

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.260
 to place in my basin as my color of 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.670
 transition blurring it very well for 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.670
 that there is no line 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.680
 giovanni 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.960

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:11.670
 to highlight a little the color and 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:15.600
 now take this palette and I will place 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:18.800
 this color hood cappuccino forgiveness in 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.750
 the outer corner of my mobile eyelid 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:26.459
 blurring very well so that it does not remain 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:29.840
 no color and without mixing or none 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.840
 line between each color 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.390
 and if it's necessary, I'll retouch my 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.870
 transition color now take this 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:44.290

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:47.860

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.170

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:11.740

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:19.720
 pencil or shadow in cream what you 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.630
 want in turquoise and I'm going to 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:26.770
 delineate my water line and also in 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:28.960
 the lower lashes blurring a 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.529
 little bit so it does not look so marked 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:37.069
 that line 

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:37.069

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:49.349
 and now take this this shade color 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:51.809
 turquoise and I'm going to seal my eyeliner 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:55.830
 so that during the day I do not run 

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:57.749
 the outline does not make me lines and 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.659
 I will also light up a little bit my 

00:04:57.749 --> 00:05:04.159
 eyebrows and the tear to seal 

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:04.159
