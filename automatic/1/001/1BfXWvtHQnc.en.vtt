00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
come up close enough to the to the bulb

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.960 
come up close enough to the to the bulb
itself<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:35.220> actually<00:01:35.520> get<00:01:35.939> the

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.089 
going to actually start to get some
growth<00:01:57.299> off<00:01:57.599> of<00:01:57.810> this<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.289> it's<00:01:58.679> going<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:58.950> be

00:01:59.089 --> 00:01:59.099 
growth off of this and it's going to be

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:01.249 
growth off of this and it's going to be
yellow<00:01:59.369> right<00:01:59.729> at<00:01:59.880> first<00:02:00.149> this<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.990> time

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
yellow right at first this is the time

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.899 
yellow right at first this is the time
that<00:02:01.289> you're<00:02:01.560> able<00:02:01.709> to<00:02:01.979> take<00:02:02.189> it<00:02:02.369> out<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.700> its

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
that you're able to take it out of its

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.059 
that you're able to take it out of its
cold<00:02:03.240> dormant<00:02:03.780> stage<00:02:04.049> basically<00:02:04.799> it's<00:02:04.950> not

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:05.069 
cold dormant stage basically it's not

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:06.620 
cold dormant stage basically it's not
really<00:02:05.310> cold<00:02:05.520> dormant<00:02:06.030> stage<00:02:06.209> but<00:02:06.509> you're

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
really cold dormant stage but you're

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.020 
really cold dormant stage but you're
just<00:02:06.810> putting<00:02:06.959> it<00:02:07.170> in<00:02:07.319> a<00:02:07.439> lower<00:02:07.649> light<00:02:07.979> at<00:02:08.759> this

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
just putting it in a lower light at this

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.850 
just putting it in a lower light at this
point<00:02:09.329> when<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.630> begins<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:10.049> have<00:02:10.289> these<00:02:10.470> small

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
point when it begins to have these small

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.850 
point when it begins to have these small
little<00:02:11.039> yellow<00:02:11.450> nubs<00:02:12.450> come<00:02:12.810> up<00:02:12.870> out<00:02:13.319> of<00:02:13.380> it

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
little yellow nubs come up out of it

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.920 
little yellow nubs come up out of it
then<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.610> can<00:02:14.730> go<00:02:14.880> ahead<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:15.180> move<00:02:15.480> it<00:02:15.690> into

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
then you can go ahead and move it into

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.620 
then you can go ahead and move it into
where<00:02:16.769> you're<00:02:16.950> going<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.310> be<00:02:17.430> storing<00:02:17.880> it<00:02:18.060> in<00:02:18.239> a

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
where you're going to be storing it in a

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.000 
where you're going to be storing it in a
few<00:02:18.840> days<00:02:19.019> with<00:02:19.349> about<00:02:19.500> four<00:02:19.739> to<00:02:19.829> five<00:02:19.890> days

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
few days with about four to five days

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.039 
few days with about four to five days
that<00:02:20.489> little<00:02:20.940> part<00:02:21.150> will<00:02:21.269> turn<00:02:21.450> green<00:02:21.780> I

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
that little part will turn green I

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.259 
that little part will turn green I
started<00:02:22.500> this<00:02:22.650> one<00:02:22.890> about<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.220> week<00:02:23.609> ago<00:02:23.730> or<00:02:24.060> so

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
started this one about a week ago or so

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.080 
started this one about a week ago or so
and<00:02:24.680> you<00:02:25.680> can<00:02:26.069> see<00:02:26.220> it's<00:02:26.340> already<00:02:26.549> pushing<00:02:26.850> out

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
and you can see it's already pushing out

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.970 
and you can see it's already pushing out
the<00:02:27.120> roots<00:02:27.510> those<00:02:28.079> roots<00:02:28.380> will<00:02:28.530> work<00:02:28.769> down

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
the roots those roots will work down

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.349 
the roots those roots will work down
through<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.340> rocks<00:02:29.579> and<00:02:29.790> actually<00:02:30.180> help

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:30.359 
through the rocks and actually help

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:34.129 
through the rocks and actually help
stabilize<00:02:31.109> the<00:02:31.140> bulb<00:02:31.590> also<00:02:32.269> in<00:02:33.269> time<00:02:33.780> though

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:34.139 
stabilize the bulb also in time though

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:36.620 
stabilize the bulb also in time though
they<00:02:35.040> do<00:02:35.100> get<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:35.400> little<00:02:35.519> top-heavy<00:02:35.910> when<00:02:36.480> they

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
they do get a little top-heavy when they

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.500 
they do get a little top-heavy when they
begin<00:02:36.989> to<00:02:37.049> bloom<00:02:37.470> so<00:02:38.130> some<00:02:38.370> support<00:02:38.819> around<00:02:38.940> it

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
begin to bloom so some support around it

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.059 
begin to bloom so some support around it
you<00:02:39.630> could<00:02:39.810> even<00:02:39.930> tie<00:02:40.260> like<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:40.500> ribbon<00:02:40.829> around

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
you could even tie like a ribbon around

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.009 
you could even tie like a ribbon around
that<00:02:41.549> too<00:02:41.790> nice<00:02:42.090> little<00:02:42.359> red<00:02:42.480> ribbon<00:02:42.900> around

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
that too nice little red ribbon around

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.970 
that too nice little red ribbon around
the<00:02:43.500> Christmas<00:02:44.010> holidays<00:02:44.489> is<00:02:44.730> nice
