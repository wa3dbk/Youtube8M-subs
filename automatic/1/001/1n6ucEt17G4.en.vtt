00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
moveable parts which is the egg does

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.890 
moveable parts which is the egg does
have<00:04:03.860> limitations<00:04:04.280> going<00:04:04.760> up<00:04:04.880> and<00:04:05.090> down<00:04:05.269> but

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
have limitations going up and down but

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.699 
have limitations going up and down but
it<00:04:06.709> moves<00:04:07.010> from<00:04:07.430> left<00:04:07.489> to<00:04:07.910> right<00:04:08.330> it's<00:04:09.260> endured

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
it moves from left to right it's endured

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:14.229 
it moves from left to right it's endured
in<00:04:10.459> a<00:04:11.300> certain<00:04:11.750> way<00:04:12.050> it's<00:04:12.790> you<00:04:13.790> you'll<00:04:14.150> think

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
in a certain way it's you you'll think

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:19.030 
in a certain way it's you you'll think
at<00:04:14.540> first<00:04:14.780> its<00:04:15.820> endured<00:04:16.820> but<00:04:17.180> just<00:04:18.169> it<00:04:18.590> it's

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
at first its endured but just it it's

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.060 
at first its endured but just it it's
just<00:04:19.370> stiff<00:04:19.940> from<00:04:20.780> the<00:04:20.900> first<00:04:21.140> time<00:04:21.410> you<00:04:21.799> open

just stiff from the first time you open

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.940 
just stiff from the first time you open
the<00:04:22.880> box

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
the box

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:29.190 
the box
just<00:04:24.700> like<00:04:24.880> momotaro's<00:04:25.780> he<00:04:26.200> has<00:04:26.580> red<00:04:28.200> accented

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
just like momotaro's he has red accented

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
chests and the compound eyes plastic

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.690

or to the tips of the intense shoulder
pads<00:04:45.310> does<00:04:46.120> it<00:04:46.360> a<00:04:46.630> flip<00:04:47.050> that<00:04:47.380> much<00:04:47.710> as<00:04:48.640> limit

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
pads does it a flip that much as limit

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.570 
pads does it a flip that much as limit
so<00:04:49.300> that's<00:04:49.900> why<00:04:50.200> he<00:04:50.530> has<00:04:50.650> limitation<00:04:51.310> in

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
so that's why he has limitation in

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.140 
so that's why he has limitation in
raising<00:04:52.450> his<00:04:52.660> arm<00:04:53.050> single<00:04:53.920> attractive<00:04:54.310> elbow

foot it goes up and down and left to
right<00:05:18.430> that's<00:05:18.730> perfect<00:05:19.240> so<00:05:19.950> this<00:05:20.950> is<00:05:21.370> the<00:05:22.240> belt

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
right that's perfect so this is the belt

right that's perfect so this is the belt
and<00:05:22.900> the<00:05:23.680> thing<00:05:23.920> then<00:05:24.430> gash<00:05:24.700> or<00:05:25.000> holders<00:05:25.860> as

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
and the thing then gash or holders as

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.740 
and the thing then gash or holders as
you<00:05:27.040> can<00:05:27.190> see<00:05:27.370> is<00:05:27.640> very<00:05:27.730> much<00:05:28.150> a<00:05:28.570> similar<00:05:29.250> to

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
you can see is very much a similar to

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.110 
you can see is very much a similar to
regular<00:05:31.750> counterpart<00:05:32.710> so<00:05:33.220> I<00:05:33.250> do<00:05:33.550> like<00:05:33.970> the

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
regular counterpart so I do like the

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.350 
regular counterpart so I do like the

than si suffice as I see to home atomic
suffice<00:05:41.430> this<00:05:42.430> toy<00:05:43.390> is<00:05:43.780> a<00:05:44.440> delight<00:05:45.220> which<00:05:46.120> is

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
suffice this toy is a delight which is

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.200 
suffice this toy is a delight which is
like<00:05:46.720> the<00:05:46.930> most<00:05:47.160> possibilities<00:05:48.190> doesn't<00:05:49.090> have

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
like the most possibilities doesn't have

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.590 
like the most possibilities doesn't have
limitations<00:05:49.950> from<00:05:50.970> the<00:05:51.970> waist<00:05:52.210> down

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 
limitations from the waist down

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.800 
limitations from the waist down
but<00:05:53.530> the<00:05:53.950> only<00:05:54.160> limitation<00:05:54.850> on<00:05:55.030> the<00:05:55.150> head<00:05:55.330> only

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810 
but the only limitation on the head only

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.040 
but the only limitation on the head only
I<00:05:56.050> mean<00:05:56.410> the<00:05:56.680> only<00:05:56.860> limitation<00:05:57.520> I<00:05:57.670> see<00:05:57.940> is<00:05:58.150> on

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
I mean the only limitation I see is on

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.030 
I mean the only limitation I see is on
the<00:05:59.800> shoulders<00:06:00.430> we<00:06:01.300> then<00:06:01.780> got<00:06:02.020> shoulders<00:06:02.500> to

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:03.040 
the shoulders we then got shoulders to

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.590 
the shoulders we then got shoulders to
come<00:06:03.220> off<00:06:03.490> so<00:06:03.760> you<00:06:04.300> can<00:06:04.690> replace<00:06:05.020> those<00:06:05.560> with

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:06.600 
come off so you can replace those with

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.560 
come off so you can replace those with
the<00:06:07.600> 10<00:06:08.140> gasher<00:06:08.650> that's<00:06:08.920> already<00:06:09.190> aim<00:06:09.570> so

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:10.570 
the 10 gasher that's already aim so

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.730 
the 10 gasher that's already aim so
let's<00:06:11.170> just<00:06:11.410> place<00:06:11.890> those<00:06:12.190> in<00:06:12.600> so<00:06:13.600> let's<00:06:14.200> now

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.740 
let's just place those in so let's now

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.230 
let's just place those in so let's now
replace<00:06:15.010> the<00:06:15.490> and<00:06:15.790> to<00:06:16.420> a<00:06:16.660> holding<00:06:16.960> hand

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
replace the and to a holding hand

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.550 
replace the and to a holding hand
so<00:06:19.750> you'll<00:06:20.020> know<00:06:20.430> what<00:06:21.430> does<00:06:22.020> it<00:06:23.020> look<00:06:23.319> like

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 
so you'll know what does it look like

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.290 
so you'll know what does it look like
holding<00:06:24.460> the<00:06:25.389> thing<00:06:25.900> gashel<00:06:26.500> which<00:06:27.160> is<00:06:27.370> for<00:06:28.120> me

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.300 
holding the thing gashel which is for me

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:28.920 
holding the thing gashel which is for me
right<00:06:28.660> now

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930 
right now

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.279 
right now
it's<00:06:29.470> weird<00:06:29.710> because<00:06:30.069> I<00:06:30.810> already<00:06:31.810> have<00:06:32.110> that

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:32.289 
it's weird because I already have that

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:34.290 
it's weird because I already have that
