00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.630 
any sense so Sony has built-in stereo
speakers<00:01:42.659> into<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.140> bezel<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.530> LCD<00:01:44.130> it

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
speakers into the bezel of the LCD it

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.810 
speakers into the bezel of the LCD it
uses<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.119> s<00:01:45.299> master<00:01:45.840> audio<00:01:46.020> system<00:01:46.619> which<00:01:46.950> is

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
uses the s master audio system which is

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.580 
uses the s master audio system which is
the<00:01:48.180> more<00:01:48.390> advanced<00:01:48.780> audio<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.259> comes<00:01:49.409> down

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
the more advanced audio that comes down

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.929 
the more advanced audio that comes down
from<00:01:49.710> their<00:01:49.890> professional<00:01:50.399> models<00:01:50.700> so

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
from their professional models so

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.520 
from their professional models so

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
hopefully we'll get some really nice

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.770 
hopefully we'll get some really nice

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
really looking forward to trying this

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.060 
really looking forward to trying this

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
I said the PJ 30 which is 950 dollars

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.499 
I said the PJ 30 which is 950 dollars
there's<00:02:01.799> also<00:02:01.920> relatively<00:02:02.549> relatively

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
there's also relatively relatively

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.620 
there's also relatively relatively
inexpensive<00:02:04.320> one

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
inexpensive one

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.400 
inexpensive one
the<00:02:04.810> witch<00:02:05.710> will<00:02:05.860> run<00:02:06.070> about<00:02:06.340> $700<00:02:07.299> so<00:02:07.840> that

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
the witch will run about $700 so that

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.740 
the witch will run about $700 so that
one<00:02:08.560> doesn't<00:02:08.950> have<00:02:08.979> the<00:02:09.069> GPS<00:02:09.520> and<00:02:09.880> frankly<00:02:10.300> if

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
one doesn't have the GPS and frankly if

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.080 
one doesn't have the GPS and frankly if
you've<00:02:10.929> read<00:02:11.140> what<00:02:11.319> I've<00:02:11.410> said<00:02:11.680> about<00:02:11.920> GPS<00:02:12.280> you

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
you've read what I've said about GPS you

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.970 
you've read what I've said about GPS you
probably<00:02:13.420> don't<00:02:13.630> need<00:02:13.840> it<00:02:13.900> and<00:02:14.200> so<00:02:14.650> you<00:02:14.800> can

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
probably don't need it and so you can

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.280 
probably don't need it and so you can
get<00:02:15.160> projector<00:02:15.790> camcorder<00:02:16.239> for<00:02:16.330> about<00:02:16.510> $700
