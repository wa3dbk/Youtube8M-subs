00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello and welcome to this 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.390
 little info video there are many 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.040
 few news and I had to 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.250
 Of course, very fast here and immediately 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.019
 share with you and point number 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.420
 One you know that I like new things 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.770
 Tried and I was shut up yesterday 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.600
 a pretty entertaining and 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.430
 funny project invited that whole thing 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.210
 New was definitely for me and 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.160
 though that was a podcast and that was 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.349
 pretty funny as I said though 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.980
 At noon I was real 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.199
 wondered 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.660
 besides, writing ball was there and 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.280
 tokio linked in the video description 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.800
 if so before that want to peek times 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.910
 also the podcast is linked in there 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.450
 then you always have to be 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.700
 drop by 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.930
 he was divided into two parts 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.430
 the first part was such a no 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.690
 introductory rounds and you know with me 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.550
 are there times not too much to 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.289
 tell except hello I am discount 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.250
 the cast at the end then for that reason alone 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.840
 I'm so kind of 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.320
 held back and the three boys have 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.370
 then a little bit about strategy games 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.719
 this was not my topic 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.910
 That's why I was there a bit 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.890
 restrained in the second part though 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.470
 on the other hand, it's about early access games 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.150
 including steam and if the good 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.770
 are or are they rather shit or 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.570
 whether they are rather bad or bad 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.180
 if it is totally unnecessary we have it like that 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.890
 talked a bit and it was very 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.020
 interesting there were many 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.820

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.400

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.759

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.200

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.420
 This podcast is supposed to be fun

 nobody is what time is when i am 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.490

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.810
