00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
whether you're a cop or a criminal so

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.850 
whether you're a cop or a criminal so
for<00:01:41.280> example<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:41.850> really<00:01:42.150> love<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.619> ak-74<00:01:43.619> but

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
for example I really love the ak-74 but

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.160 
for example I really love the ak-74 but
it<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.189> criminal<00:01:44.610> gun<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.630> I've<00:01:45.780> been<00:01:45.899> using

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
it is a criminal gun so I've been using

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.889 
it is a criminal gun so I've been using
that<00:01:46.320> gun<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.680> lot<00:01:47.009> in<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.399> operator<00:01:47.850> class<00:01:48.060> so

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
that gun a lot in the operator class so

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.620 
that gun a lot in the operator class so
when<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.229> actually<00:01:49.680> get<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.790> weapons<00:01:51.180> license

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
when I actually get the weapons license

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.440 
when I actually get the weapons license
for<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:51.990> gun<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.530> can<00:01:53.130> then<00:01:53.340> use<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.820> as<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.060> cop

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
for that gun I can then use it as a cop

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.870 
for that gun I can then use it as a cop
it's<00:01:55.200> pretty<00:01:55.439> simple<00:01:55.799> right<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.460> if<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.700> have

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
it's pretty simple right so if you have

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.609 
it's pretty simple right so if you have
a<00:01:56.909> favorite<00:01:57.210> gun<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.780> you're<00:01:57.899> upset<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.500> you

buildings are in the middle and you can

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.920 
buildings are in the middle and you can
basically<00:03:17.310> they<00:03:17.520> go<00:03:17.640> through<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.090> middle<00:03:18.300> or

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930
