00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:05.929 

okay<00:00:04.649> so<00:00:04.710> today<00:00:05.069> I'm<00:00:05.160> going<00:00:05.310> to<00:00:05.399> test<00:00:05.729> the

00:00:05.929 --> 00:00:05.939 
okay so today I'm going to test the

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:08.120 
okay so today I'm going to test the
return<00:00:06.420> to<00:00:06.720> home<00:00:06.750> functionality<00:00:07.620> at<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:07.769> DJI

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
return to home functionality at the DJI

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.459 
return to home functionality at the DJI
phantom<00:00:08.670> I've<00:00:09.179> got<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:09.570> original<00:00:09.660> firmware<00:00:10.230> I

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
phantom I've got the original firmware I

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.720 
phantom I've got the original firmware I
think<00:00:10.889> it's<00:00:11.010> like<00:00:11.280> 3.10<00:00:11.969> or<00:00:12.269> whatever<00:00:12.570> that<00:00:12.749> is

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:13.730 
think it's like 3.10 or whatever that is

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.060 
think it's like 3.10 or whatever that is
to<00:00:14.730> flight<00:00:14.999> out<00:00:15.500> transmitter<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.710> see<00:00:16.950> if<00:00:17.010> the

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
to flight out transmitter and see if the

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.790 
to flight out transmitter and see if the
console<00:00:17.400> see<00:00:18.240> its<00:00:18.360> landing<00:00:18.780> it's<00:00:19.020> kicking<00:00:19.560> off

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
console see its landing it's kicking off

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.279 
console see its landing it's kicking off
from<00:00:20.039> its<00:00:20.220> real<00:00:20.550> helicopter<00:00:20.929> landing<00:00:21.929> pad<00:00:21.960> and

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
from its real helicopter landing pad and

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.960 
from its real helicopter landing pad and
each<00:00:22.410> scroll<00:00:22.830> demographic<00:00:23.490> see<00:00:23.640> how<00:00:23.880> this

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
each scroll demographic see how this

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:40.910 
each scroll demographic see how this
goes

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.080 

okay<00:00:41.920> so<00:00:41.980> it's<00:00:42.220> in<00:00:42.310> a<00:00:42.370> nice<00:00:42.520> stable<00:00:42.790> hover

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
okay so it's in a nice stable hover

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.680 
okay so it's in a nice stable hover
about<00:00:43.510> a<00:00:43.750> 100<00:00:44.500> meters<00:00:44.770> away<00:00:44.920> right<00:00:45.280> now<00:00:45.310> and<00:00:45.730> so

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
about a 100 meters away right now and so

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.110 
about a 100 meters away right now and so
I'm<00:00:46.750> going<00:00:46.900> to<00:00:46.960> go<00:00:47.050> ahead<00:00:47.140> and<00:00:47.700> switch<00:00:48.700> off<00:00:48.940> the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
I'm going to go ahead and switch off the

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.320 
I'm going to go ahead and switch off the
transmitter<00:00:49.570> and<00:00:50.080> we'll<00:00:50.710> see<00:00:50.890> what<00:00:51.010> happens

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:51.330 
transmitter and we'll see what happens

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.100 
transmitter and we'll see what happens
switching<00:00:52.330> it<00:00:52.420> off<00:00:52.920> it's<00:00:53.920> turned<00:00:54.160> off<00:00:55.110> still

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
switching it off it's turned off still

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.049 
switching it off it's turned off still
in<00:00:56.200> the<00:00:56.290> tougher<00:00:57.300> not<00:00:58.300> doing<00:00:58.660> anything<00:00:58.840> yet

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
in the tougher not doing anything yet

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.119 
in the tougher not doing anything yet
just<00:01:01.059> hanging<00:01:01.390> out<00:01:01.449> hovering<00:01:01.980> looks<00:01:02.980> like

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
just hanging out hovering looks like

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.830 
just hanging out hovering looks like
it's<00:01:03.250> flying<00:01:03.430> back<00:01:03.699> towards<00:01:04.059> us<00:01:06.570> not<00:01:07.570> really

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
it's flying back towards us not really

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.969 
it's flying back towards us not really
seemed<00:01:08.020> to<00:01:08.140> increase<00:01:08.260> much<00:01:08.560> an<00:01:08.680> altitude

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
seemed to increase much an altitude

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.920 
seemed to increase much an altitude
although<00:01:09.700> it<00:01:09.760> might<00:01:09.850> be<00:01:10.030> right<00:01:10.240> now<00:01:12.930> back

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
although it might be right now back

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:21.270 
although it might be right now back
towards<00:01:14.320> us<00:01:17.550> pretty<00:01:18.550> good<00:01:18.729> flip<00:01:20.100> like<00:01:21.100> it's

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
towards us pretty good flip like it's

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.200 
towards us pretty good flip like it's
slowing<00:01:21.550> down

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.679 

you

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
you

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:33.149 
you
I'm<00:01:29.140> going<00:01:29.320> to<00:01:29.439> a<00:01:29.500> hover<00:01:31.259> hover<00:01:32.259> is<00:01:32.590> very<00:01:32.860> close

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
I'm going to a hover hover is very close

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.719 
I'm going to a hover hover is very close
to<00:01:33.189> above<00:01:33.610> the<00:01:33.640> original<00:01:33.969> takeoff<00:01:34.600> spot<00:01:35.729> just

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
to above the original takeoff spot just

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:46.560 
to above the original takeoff spot just
hanging<00:01:37.060> out<00:01:37.180> there

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.980 

like<00:01:47.230> it's<00:01:47.380> starting<00:01:47.740> a<00:01:47.800> slow<00:01:48.540> descent<00:01:49.540> on<00:01:49.750> its

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
like it's starting a slow descent on its

00:01:49.990 --> 00:02:03.680 
like it's starting a slow descent on its
own

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:22.740 

nice<00:02:04.170> control<00:02:04.380> big<00:02:04.830> ending

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.090 

and<00:02:23.750> I<00:02:23.870> have<00:02:23.990> not<00:02:24.170> touched<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:24.620> transmitter

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
and I have not touched the transmitter

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.320 
and I have not touched the transmitter
sense<00:02:25.450> so<00:02:26.650> see<00:02:27.650> it<00:02:27.770> landed<00:02:28.040> within<00:02:28.400> half<00:02:29.180> a

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
sense so see it landed within half a

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.450 
sense so see it landed within half a
meter<00:02:29.570> of<00:02:29.780> its<00:02:29.930> original<00:02:30.380> takeoff<00:02:31.220> place

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
meter of its original takeoff place

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:41.100 
meter of its original takeoff place
doing<00:02:31.820> return<00:02:32.150> to<00:02:32.240> home<00:02:32.360> that's<00:02:32.690> pretty

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.170
