00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.700
 fashionable for bob lazar seems to say 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.519
 truth when describing the principle of action 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.010
 the ship's reactor we failed 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.040
 penetrate into the details of his device but 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.389
 the general principle is clear in the reactor 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.880
 a very heavy element decays 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.789
 heavy but stable which is not 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:25.220
 meets on earth we placed it in 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.220
 periodic table number 115 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.670
 this element creates a reference 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.949
 gravitational wave and electric 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.770
 energy which leads the apparatus into 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.690
 motion gravity boosters 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.300
 placed in the ship reinforce this 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.149
 wave and shift it in phase by other 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.980
 words break sync and then 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.200
 this wave is emitted from at bottom 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.989
 apparatus earth i other objects 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.190
 emit their own sleepy waves then 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.110
 while the apparatus is produced 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.440
 the opposite wave which creates 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.440
 lift 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.680
 the machine produces no fire no smoke 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.329
 compressed air nothing like that 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.390
 using what we used to 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.360
 introduce an object in motion is a mover 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.900
 interaction based fields 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.310
 interaction fields can 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.930
 demonstrate by example two 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.420
 magnets 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.030
 their opposite poles attract 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.290
 same repellent 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.479
 Lazar claims that this device 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:23.540
 uses cosmos heart 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.540
 this dream is on and attraction and repulsion 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.650
 using earth materials and the most 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.960
 advanced technology we even 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:38.810
 approximately can not recreate either 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:41.180
 one of these systems was a reactor 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.579
 based on complete 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.390
 annihilation which reacts matter 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.220
 antimatter 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:52.110
 we haven't even given up this problem yet 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.909
 we know that in principle it is possible we 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.570
 created reactors operating on 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.780
 substance splitting 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.250
 we are trying to create synthesis reactors 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.799
 who would give energy as well 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.979
 the sun but we didn't even think about 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.780
 anti-matter reactor which would have 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.170
 one hundred percent efficiency and suddenly here it is 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.030
 on 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.500
 and not just a valid model no this 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.020
 natural sample that can 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.970
 raise one person whose not 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.150
 gives less energy more than whole 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.190
 nuclear power plant so this 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.650
 technology is not just ahead of ours 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.650
 this is something incredible
