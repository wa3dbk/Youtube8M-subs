perfectly honest this is my favorite

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.880 
perfectly honest this is my favorite
cleanser<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.869> way<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.350> actually

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
cleanser so the way that this actually

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.580 
cleanser so the way that this actually
works<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.729> you're<00:01:14.909> supposed<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.590> wash

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
works is that you're supposed to wash

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.890 
works is that you're supposed to wash
your<00:01:16.799> face<00:01:17.009> first<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.610> just<00:01:17.820> normal<00:01:18.180> warm

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
your face first to just normal warm

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.560 
your face first to just normal warm
water<00:01:19.200> hot<00:01:19.650> water<00:01:19.850> cool<00:01:20.850> or<00:01:21.119> whatever<00:01:21.390> you

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
water hot water cool or whatever you

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.630 
water hot water cool or whatever you
prefer<00:01:21.720> your<00:01:22.200> rooms<00:01:22.530> would<00:01:22.890> be<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.189> best<00:01:23.400> and

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
prefer your rooms would be the best and

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.910 
prefer your rooms would be the best and
then<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.270> can<00:01:24.390> either<00:01:24.540> just<00:01:24.780> gently<00:01:25.470> massage

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
then you can either just gently massage

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.640 
then you can either just gently massage
it<00:01:26.189> on<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.759> your<00:01:26.909> skin<00:01:27.240> or<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.840> can<00:01:28.020> also<00:01:28.320> wet

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
it on to your skin or you can also wet

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.710 
it on to your skin or you can also wet
this<00:01:28.920> first<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.610> then<00:01:29.640> apply<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.509> think

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
this first and then apply it I think

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.060 
this first and then apply it I think
there'll<00:01:30.869> be<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:31.020> wasted<00:01:31.470> product<00:01:31.799> though<00:01:31.950> if

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
there'll be a wasted product though if

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.310 
there'll be a wasted product though if
you<00:01:32.220> did<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.640> some<00:01:33.180> people<00:01:33.479> actually<00:01:33.600> get<00:01:34.170> in

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
you did that some people actually get in

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.590 
you did that some people actually get in
their<00:01:34.500> hands<00:01:34.860> first<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.549> then<00:01:35.670> massage<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.509> up

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
their hands first and then massage it up

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.270 
their hands first and then massage it up
and<00:01:36.780> then<00:01:36.869> put<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.140> on<00:01:37.229> but<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.799> feel<00:01:38.100> that

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
and then put it on but I feel that

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.310 
and then put it on but I feel that
doesn't<00:01:38.610> love<00:01:38.820> us<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.270> much<00:01:39.420> now<00:01:40.290> the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
doesn't love us that much now the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.350 
doesn't love us that much now the
downside<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:41.250> this<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.880> haven't

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
downside of this is that I haven't

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
downside of this is that I haven't
really<00:01:42.600> seen<00:01:42.840> any<00:01:43.140> improvement<00:01:44.899> it<00:01:45.899> actually

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
really seen any improvement it actually

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.490 
really seen any improvement it actually
has<00:01:46.880> this<00:01:47.880> pink<00:01:48.360> stuff<00:01:48.659> in<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.110> which<00:01:49.290> she

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
has this pink stuff in it which she

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.340 
has this pink stuff in it which she
actually<00:01:49.680> used<00:01:50.130> when<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.520> have<00:01:51.350> chickenpox

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
actually used when you have chickenpox

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.679 
actually used when you have chickenpox
or<00:01:52.979> anything<00:01:53.310> like<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.549> or<00:01:53.909> Russia's<00:01:54.479> itchy

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.979 
to be good for redness in any acne
erasing<00:02:08.610> of<00:02:08.940> that<00:02:09.090> I<00:02:09.209> think<00:02:09.270> that's<00:02:09.539> why<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:09.780> got

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
erasing of that I think that's why I got

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.640 
erasing of that I think that's why I got
this<00:02:10.140> because<00:02:10.379> I'd<00:02:10.530> if<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:10.770> break<00:02:10.979> out

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
this because I'd if you break out

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.280 
this because I'd if you break out
but<00:02:12.220> I<00:02:12.250> found<00:02:12.879> that<00:02:13.150> this<00:02:13.269> actually<00:02:13.720> drives<00:02:14.019> my

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
but I found that this actually drives my

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.179 
but I found that this actually drives my
Skinner<00:02:14.590> a<00:02:14.829> lot<00:02:15.299> I<00:02:16.299> can<00:02:17.140> still<00:02:17.409> apply<00:02:17.950> my

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:18.189 
Skinner a lot I can still apply my

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:19.949 
Skinner a lot I can still apply my
moisturizer<00:02:18.430> over<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.390> top

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
moisturizer over the top

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.899 
moisturizer over the top
later<00:02:20.260> on<00:02:20.530> after<00:02:20.769> I've<00:02:21.069> done<00:02:21.250> everything<00:02:21.790> and

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
later on after I've done everything and

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:23.479 
later on after I've done everything and
it<00:02:22.030> my<00:02:22.209> skin<00:02:22.269> will<00:02:22.540> be<00:02:22.689> fine

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
it my skin will be fine

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.250 
it my skin will be fine
but<00:02:24.489> yeah<00:02:24.939> you<00:02:25.000> got<00:02:25.209> to<00:02:25.360> be<00:02:25.480> careful<00:02:25.930> if<00:02:26.049> you've

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
but yeah you got to be careful if you've

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.410 
but yeah you got to be careful if you've
got<00:02:26.500> dry<00:02:26.709> skin<00:02:26.739> okay<00:02:27.459> guys<00:02:27.700> I<00:02:27.939> think<00:02:28.150> it's<00:02:28.269> just

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
got dry skin okay guys I think it's just

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.050 
got dry skin okay guys I think it's just
because<00:02:28.750> it's<00:02:28.900> in<00:02:29.019> that<00:02:29.049> bar<00:02:29.470> form<00:02:30.060> another

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
because it's in that bar form another

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.330 
because it's in that bar form another
thing<00:02:31.390> with<00:02:31.540> this<00:02:31.689> one<00:02:31.959> even<00:02:32.560> though<00:02:32.920> it<00:02:32.950> does

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
thing with this one even though it does

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.160 
thing with this one even though it does
dry<00:02:33.760> everything<00:02:34.150> out<00:02:34.420> doesn't<00:02:34.840> mean<00:02:34.930> that

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
dry everything out doesn't mean that

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.960 
dry everything out doesn't mean that
it's<00:02:35.290> going<00:02:35.470> to<00:02:35.560> necessarily<00:02:35.829> remove<00:02:36.730> your

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
it's going to necessarily remove your

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.910 
it's going to necessarily remove your
makeup<00:02:37.299> I<00:02:37.540> found<00:02:37.840> that<00:02:38.019> didn't<00:02:38.439> remove<00:02:38.769> my

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
makeup I found that didn't remove my

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.979 
makeup I found that didn't remove my
makeup<00:02:39.129> at<00:02:39.519> all<00:02:40.709> and<00:02:42.000> also<00:02:43.000> when<00:02:43.659> you<00:02:43.810> are
