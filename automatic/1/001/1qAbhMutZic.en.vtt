00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
 good so if you are coming from the series of 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.250
 videos I'm doing already done 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.710
 preparation skin smoked and I've sic 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.849
 simple basic one with cotton swab 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.920
 doping sky and now slater the eyeliner 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.509
 is thus one of the items as soon as 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.910
 let the cleaner makeup but in 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.970
 my opinion is so super know 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.390
 of that tiano eye is the eyeliner and 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.130
 also at the same time is an item is a ne 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.590
 which scares people both inclusively 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.150
 already scared but today our system is only 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.940
 because I've learned that you should open a 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.649
 file and the sword then when we the 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.719
 people can not despair 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.300
 This is so and this is the biggest secret. 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.570
 winner is always not to be afraid of him 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.750
 we fear it and the will is that had the 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.600
 liquid and gel has cream has several types 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.030
 so my favorite pen is him 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.039
 I think it's super fun, this is the most 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.739
 easy for me to apply but even 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.079
 so i mistake tap that it is part but i 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.510
 I think so you should be in the stores to 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.010
 see what you like best friends 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.710
 my prefer the liquid has others 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.450
 prefer gel then you will only know 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.490
 testing is not because I say I want 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.710
 It's easier for you, it'll be more 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.470
 maybe yes maybe not easy 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.330
 so let's start I think well of 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.780
 side is very personal there are people who like 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.820
 more up there people like more know 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.280
 out there, the harder you have people who 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.259
 find that crooked tip that knows 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.560
 what goes up does there are people who like 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.560
 but he knows that nilson pulled 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.840
 so it goes like this from the taste of each 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.579
 person I'm going to do the way I like 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.549
 one of the ways that I like the most 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.810
 that is neither so straight 1 reaching to like 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.000
 nothing down to him than anyone else 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.250
 deserve and look sad is not so fallen 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.470
 so come on, I 'll get it so it 's very light. 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.369
 in the pen without fear because otherwise naia 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.860
 in the beginning and I look like this is to see 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.799
 How are you going to stay at this time, are you eyes? 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.810
 always people are important and then I 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.360
 I pick up here I see in the end here 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.780
 eyebrow I'm going to see here but it's cool 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.299
 But you give me here, you see here they come. 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.930
 Oh well, but you're going to make it so 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.930
 boarding or 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:16.200
 You know strange is quieter and 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.610
 improvement 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.610
 I still like it more like this 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.860
 So, you see, I'll draw some here. 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.500
 When you come up, it 's cool, you. 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.420
 take the tip of it to be very light and 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.270
 and you look and speak camillis does not vary 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.150
 very sure it will be horrible but I 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:43.530
 I think it will not not stay the straightens 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:49.230
 And then I'll get here, you see, it 's not 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:54.690
 half-way down and I'm going 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:03:00.750
 bringing the eyelid gene time 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:04.860
 filling up right here, you see. 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:12.510
 Odd is that parking from dae nothing 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:14.100
 This is the basis of it now, come on, I come. 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.270
 I liked it a lot more so many people 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.730
 also talking about how to do the 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:22.080
 guaratinguetÃ¡ is thus the mystery that 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:25.950
 the geometry a triangle and now I 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:28.560
 I come here can not shake with the league 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.530
 When you went to get the eye, it will not go away. 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.640
 trying to apply is the blinking eye 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.450
 shaking that will not work 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.060
 At this time you have to be well. 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.350
 you need to do when these items are 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.130
 followed 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.660
 My god my description is better here 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.580
 I 'm not liking I'm going to fix it 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:52.530
 coming back from a tac know when it starts 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.680
 here it starts so I try to join with 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.050
 the line turning into the eyelid 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.690
 remembering that you not err much is 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:04.260
 You better stay put the tip of the 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:08.040
 Brush Pen B Ideal Eyelashes 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:10.680
 op key hi people swab that person 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.570
 I did not bring when making it nothing to 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:18.049
 people stay with how much in the popular 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:18.049
 do like me but she's part of me 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:23.400
 here on the tip comes calmly long ago 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.290
 caution 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.290
 the blink I stop 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:33.720
 and then I like to sing in bands know 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:36.150
 To join here, man, urban banking. 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.180
 and it's taking shape the way it is 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:43.590
 Of course it's not cool, but it will stay. 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:45.410
 there I'm feeling I see I already like 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.270
 like this 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.550
 who was doing it and was already 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.669
 almost everything ready I was inventing and 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:57.840
 mess here I do not tell you 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:59.610
 Look at me and we know how 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:07.350
 It was terrible this moment but gave everything 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:09.330
 right for me one of the things most 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.650
 Difficult in the eyeliner to make a goal 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.840
 same one that has not yet 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.630
 finishing with corrective camargo 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.639
 I'll try to make the other people equal 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:24.960
 This part for me is harder then. 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:29.210
 as it is so same way and not 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.210
 ends at the time of great video 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.980
 sometimes we're here for a bit 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:48.790
 example as at first I wanted more 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:51.640
 But I messed up and I ended up 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.260
 two sides still just so she but me 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:56.380
 I like people who do not like it. 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:58.900
 eye more drawn and such I like and class 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:01.930
 You want it to be more defined. 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:07.270
 these things take collective legal pass 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:10.510
 with the brush and makes it so for the fret 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:12.180
 Anyone who does not know 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:17.280
 mirror right 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:17.280
 it's ok the excess it gets more marked 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:23.170
 more defined 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.940
 There are people who like to look more 

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:28.210
 pulled I think it looks good it 's big 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:30.280
 well well feminine well I like 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:32.680
 and who does not like to go from here 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.960
 So I need to make this tip but I 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:38.020
 I think then put the mascara such no 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:40.780
 that extravagant thing is not there 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.730
 stay one when I do this kind of dead 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:45.160
 a lot of people ask and end up like 

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:47.320
 you did and used the tape so did not use tape 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.060
 I do it myself and hope you have 

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.850
 liked the tips are simple 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:53.650
 beyond the simple and demanding when using 

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:55.630
 this kind of roof so many people 

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:58.270
 asks if I do with this tape but 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:00.490
 yes, I am very simple and I hope you 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:02.230
 We liked it okay if you 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:03.820
 Did you not forget to leave June for me? 

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:06.100
 because I'll be very happy 

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:07.990
 a kiss must have liked that date 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:10.330
 serves three videos on skin preparation 

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:12.250
 and outlined I was owed 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:14.410
 You can see from the roof a lot. 

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.640
 People ask also teaches that the cat 

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:18.760
 and the president is such 

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:20.500
 today I think this style of ally 

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:22.750
 mix with me like this with my eyes 

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:25.270
 logical lack of rigor is lacking throughout the 

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:26.830
 preparation here, but I thought it might 

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:28.410
 Can you understand more or less? 

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:31.240
 and you have seen that it is very easy and that 

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:33.220
 making mistakes is part even have to it is to 

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.890
 to be able to fix there picks up the square and 

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:37.510
 doing nobody always hits all the time 

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:39.190
 everybody is like this is normal part 

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:41.860
 that's what I wanted to pass on to you 

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:43.750
 but it's also very easy to do 

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:45.310
 It's not a seven- headed creature. 

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:47.530
 on the contrary it goes slowly like this 

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:49.720
 Are you going to breathe when you talk? 

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:51.250
 for him to pass eyeliner will fall on 

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.840
 bunch will do it the way you like it 

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.730
 of the eye to visit 

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.900
 right, and then yes I hope you have 

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:58.210
