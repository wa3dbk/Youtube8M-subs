00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.440
 hello guys welcome back on a malus tex 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.539
 this year was the year of the self 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.160
 even the berlin faery you are 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.600
 performing these days have been 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.789
 presented several phones with 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.539
 front camera the more than 8 13 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.300
 megapixel 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.750
 there are so many applications on the 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.940
 different stores both android and ios that 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.190
 allow editing of photographs 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.890
 both with filters, you know what it is 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.469
 generally more advanced but I am there today 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.750
 I present the review of the lenses 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.480
 external for smartphone icsi source 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.010
 these lenses cost 11 euros 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.629
 so it can only be an expense 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.940
 quite ridiculously then they are 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.920
 precisely three lenses the first is one 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.489
 macro lens the second is a twenty year old 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.530
 which allows you to capture an image 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.420
 the broader a spectrum the more image 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.789
 wide and the third slow in a lens 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.250
 classic fish eye 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:06.540
 in short, they can do something 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.460
 a nicer had the effect 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.470
 photographs to enable you to obtain 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.869
 the more I like about instagram on facebook 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.700
 we find out in the review the 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.530
 xvi source lens packaging is 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.590
 quite sparse indeed consists 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.420
 simply a plastic bag 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.220
 some in which they are contained and 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.380
 three lenses and helix what is needed for 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.719
 apply 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.149
 all on the smartphone the three lenses are 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:31.369
 covered from both ends with gods 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:32.720
 its objectives the lens we are 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.229
 seeing at the moment is a lens 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.509
 wide where the network is attached below 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.939
 maker in fact the wide lens cannot 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.549
 be used if not the municipality 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:45.439
 concomitant with the macro lens is 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.659
 difficult enough to avoid these two 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:50.390
 slow then my advice is that 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:53.210
 not to tighten too much because yes 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.149
 may need to use a tool 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.860
 in particular this lens that we are 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.780
 seeing in this instant instead el fish 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.170
 eye that allows you to capture a corner 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.240
 of vision of about 180 degrees 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.959
 this is the hook that results a lot 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.349
 hard also quite difficult to 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:11.120
 to open 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.400
 but it is a positive thing because it allows 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.640
 to prevent the lens from falling in the moment 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.950
 in which we are going to apply 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.680
 football on your smartphone is good to do 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.060
 attention that the center of the read 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.340
 match with the center is the goal 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.550
 of the camera otherwise you will see 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:30.069
 of the contours cut a photograph 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.660
 will also be quite ugly valente can 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.740
 also be applied obviously on 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.600
 front camera 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.280
 be careful though before deciding to 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.050
 buy this lens because not all 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.290
 devices are compatible indeed 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.700
 this nokia lumia 520 and the lens the 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.380
 ice in the lens too short not 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.330
 manages to reach the goal 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.270
 this photograph has been discarded with 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:52.150
 to the fisheye lens and very distorted though 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.739
 allows you to capture the subject who 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.260
 enough photography in the middle 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.150
 well however also taking the whole e 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.040
 angle and view at 180 degrees 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.810
 this instead the original image that 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.489
 despite being slightly blurred from 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.200
 a good idea of ​​the difference between 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.090
 the visual angle captured with 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.680
 the goal or not this image 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.650
 instead it was captured with the lens 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.739
 white that unlike the fish eye 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.570
 allows you to expand the view and vi 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.370
 without unduly affecting it 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.470
 on quality this is the original photo 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:24.160
 which shows the difference 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.959
 compared to the fish eye crotto the lens 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.489
 macro is my favorite because in addition to 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.290
 don't distort being in my opinion 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.239
 qualitatively better allows 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.860
 capture photographs of details 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.959
 details like those for offers on 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.450
 lens that is not seen almost in the 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.450
 original photograph in this selphy 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.829
 instead we can see mine 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.760
 ugly face with the fisheye lens 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:47.470
 and the comparison with photography without 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.269
 the impressive body this has been 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.340
 taken with the front camera 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.860
 this is photography with the wide lens 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.760
 which still allows the widening of the amplitude 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.230
 the spectrum of vision and this is without 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.180
 lens and in fact we see the difference 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.280
 fundamental still between reflection and 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.650
 wide in terms of distortion 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.780
 of image in favor of course 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.240
 why lens should buy these lenses 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.620
 second put because for 11 euros yes 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.240
 manage to keep to the effects of 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.040
 photographs are quite interesting 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.329
 like this eye or for example this one 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.709
 beer bottle that was then 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.859
 retouched with a program of 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.540
 photoediting or you can ad 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.610
 example generate a video with mine 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.380
 preferred, which is the macro lens e 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.790
 get this a particular effect 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.980
 for example the charger of 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.410
 song thanks for following me if 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.480
 you need information you can 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.460
 comment and in the description you will find 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.580
 the link to these lenses 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.580
 Hello
