00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.589
 Today I'll teach you how to make a 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:09.480
 home sharpener ht sandro to do 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.809
 This wonder you'll need of course 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.109
 From an old hd this one I already took the 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.539
 head and the arm of reading that are these 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.949
 the little things that move here because 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.250
 they mess up when we do 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.779
 the sharpener also accused of a source of 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.000
 used computer 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.250
 she has is running course will 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.500
 need a sandpaper and using this 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:37.140
 number 151 will need a pair of 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.129
 protection when tuning things up 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.930
 of this machine 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.960
 The first thing I'm gonna do is pick up. 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.719
 a compass and measure the radius of the radius disk 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.980
 the distance between the center and the edge and there 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.530
 on the line to draw a circle 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.930
 that has the same radius 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.260
 then I measure the radius of this inner part 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.870
 here from the disk and I do this cycle inside 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.329
 from the other circle there I need to cut 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.789
 all this and take that sauce out 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.830
 then I have to put this sandpaper in 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.650
 Up the disc I'm going to use a little bit 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.610
 white glue while we wait 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.250
 sandpaper and here 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.960
 let's prepare the source is the source that goes 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.180
 make the engine turn 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.159
 only the source does not turn on by itself 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.350
 where we plug in is 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.479
 I need to make a special call here. 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.659
 and we 'll make that connection using 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.369
 a metal clip to make the source 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.340
 call I have to connect this 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.040
 green little wire here to your black neighbor 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.549
 on this side or on this side here then I go 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.009
 cut a little bit of the clip and make a 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.040
 public 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:49.320
 I'll use this to connect the wire 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:51.600
 green on the black river when the cola ck is only 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:57.420
 you put on your goggles 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:59.579
 connect the hd to the source put a background 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.310
 black to make the scene more dramatic 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:07.980
 and sharpen whatever you want 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.980

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.220
 If you're going to do this at home some 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.349
 Important first tips is that this 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.970
 glasses here is not to look better 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.250
 in the video is not to use for real 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.590
 because it will not be cool if those 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.840
 incandescent irons pick up in your eye 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.730
 another thing if you are afi to a 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.950
 Swiss Army Knife something you 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.140
 I really like that the face is better 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.890
 you train first on some piece of 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.079
 cheapie iron and the third tip is 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.220
 When we were going to spend, there would be a 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:48.349
 time he 'll be spending 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.299
 It's just that you take sandpaper and play it. 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.549
 with a little damp cloth 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:55.910
 and put another because she was crowned 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:57.739
 with a white glue and it will come off easy but 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:03.799
 videos with this one you find in a 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:07.010
 manual if you like these inventions 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:09.680
 and technological recycling, leaving here 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.500
 underneath two cool things leaving the 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:16.099
 hurricane with hb you can make a 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.569
 turned into water using a magnet and the 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:20.900
 hd an equal to that where there is 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:23.840
 in this sandpaper and also leaving the 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.269
 USB fan 1 link with the 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.459
 little engine is inside the DVD gives to 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.989
 We make a fan that connects more 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.989
 this legislator a usb input 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.700
