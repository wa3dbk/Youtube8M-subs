00:00:01.259 --> 00:00:02.360
 Hello friends 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.629
 today we are going to talk or about paper shredders 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.049
 it is not a theme 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:10.969
 really computer but if you get 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:12.439
 what is the use 

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:14.639
 in any office even 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.639
 in many homes it can be 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:23.669
 we are continuously receiving a propaganda inquiry that transcended 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:26.800
 Per hundred that we have after the one who throws 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.899
 organic malik data protection forces us to destroy certain type 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:34.990
 documents that contain information 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.640
 of natural persons 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.020
 and for that we use this type of equipment that we are 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.560
 there are different types in principle of the first the classification could be in 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.070
 size function 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.220
 city ​​of 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.270
 of paper 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.630
 receipt of paper 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.170
 depending on the liters of capacity we have a fucking type 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.210
 against smaller 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.090
 because this case this the bases 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.220
 the in time 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.290
 when the paper tray is smaller 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.730
 more simple excel 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.730
 the device - capacity 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.510
 the second 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.570
 the general classifications 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.410
 this kind of punishment for all 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.580
 refers to the 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.590
 type of cut what is this paper going to do 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.770
 we would have 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.300
 two types the first that only cuts into strips on paper 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.430
 holbrooke 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.750
 in a crossed cream crush cream you are making longitudinal cuts to these 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:44.660
 quotes 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.730
 in essence what could be 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.440
 we must tie the confetti 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.760
 depending on the sizes of the width of the shooter age length of the pony 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.710
 from the strip 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.960
 l We will have different types of security interest 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.880
 what would be the organic law of data protection that we will 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.789
 yes 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.789
 the machine will serve us or it will not serve 

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:13.429
 finally the 

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:17.079
 the last way to classify this type of vaccine would be 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.159
 type of ere 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:22.180
 the gestures we can 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.889
 introduce to do is destroy 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:29.389
 the simplest of course your against that we will admit paper 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:31.539
 more or less things at the same time 

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:32.569
 and if to go 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:33.799
 as we enter 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.029
 higher capacity machines 

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:39.029
 we can introduce your tents 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.599
 and also checks and cards 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:49.749
 his partner would have been left and he will explain them a little 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:53.009
 the funeral of these machines 

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:57.309
 complicated but yes there are a couple of things that you have to keep in mind about 

00:02:57.309 --> 00:03:00.719
 everything from the point of view of the security of use of 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:03.719
 of this data 

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:06.999
 well we have increased unemployment 

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:10.179
 here we have a best-selling model in haiti 

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:12.159
 the foundation as 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:15.249
 as it is very simple simple we do not have a sector 

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:16.739
 with three positions 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.399
 they have already turned off the automatism 

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:22.169
 put a gear reset 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:23.779
 inverse of the blades 

00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:26.669
 in case some jamming insisted added that the paper 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:29.299
 we fight then let's look 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:31.179
 the number indicated when 

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:32.699
 by the manufacturer 

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:34.299
 maximum of geese 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.299
 ilerdense surprises 

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:47.219
 caution about everything 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:48.929
 with ties 

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:53.849
 and like any mailbox you vary any type of clothes or accessories that live 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.389
 the producers the blades 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:58.439
 needless to say 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:01.429
 efe we ​​do not leave the children the Caribbean 

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:03.489
 of that type of apparatus 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.489
 with the presence of drugs are the blades 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:10.209
 It's like 60% lower 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:13.739
 we must always make it effective 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.180
 with his leadership 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.109
 Explain 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.540
 good in bigger decks this propeller sell its use of oil 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.069
 for that reason similar 

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:27.199
 million euros a correct operation 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:30.199
 in several interviews as we know it is not necessary 

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:35.269
 look how is the garden where among the neighbors of this case will come 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.190
 uu luis puig in shenzhen 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.949
 despite losing power 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:42.949
 all when this data united states consumes 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.770
 anyone 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.180
 forest this information has been useful 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.419
 we remind you that the wolf monster 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:54.819
 those together with the difficulties 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:05:00.639
 On occasion we have written a post about this type of devices 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:04.099
 management u 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:05.969
 security 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:08.710
 sela el balear 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.589
 We advise you loyal ones to come training 

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:15.830
 allow more detailed this 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.419
 and of course you also have them in your 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:20.099
 the store more than buying it
