00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:16.340
 good mates I will show you my 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.660
 car and the improvements it has made in 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:24.020
 he here you can see some flanges for tube 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:28.669
 of 15 millimeters of plumbing in this 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:31.809
 case my iron is 14 and they stay 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:31.809
 pretty tight 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.360
 then down here you see a little 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.330
 vessel made of channel with two 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.850
 covers on which we can support 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.370
 our reeds or the umbrella or what 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.220
 we can carry 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.070
 and then we have 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.630
 for me the most important thing is the 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.750
 third wheel 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:59.260
 this allows us to push the car instead 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.120
 to pull it as you can see it comes out 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:06.000
 perfectly without needing any 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.000
 tool and it's very easy to place 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.850
 and well, I'll show you the focus 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.370
 I have when we are going to fish for 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.470
 the night 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.530
 it is an idea of â€‹â€‹our roman companion 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:05.800
 so that you see that your explanations do not 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.410
 they fall on a broken sack is simply a 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.960
 Lunch box with a methacrylate lid and 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.300
 a 12 volt low bulb 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.760
 consumption 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.760
 this is connected to a small battery 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.069
 we illuminate our position after 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:36.810
 you can see the fire with a handle 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.810
 despotic to paint 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.980
 the possible game does not try to pressure 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.480
 and with some flanges 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.680
 for tube in this case the subjects 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.680
 directly raised 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.100
 Well, if we use iron from this 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.280
 kind 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.480
 of angle to be able to take us in the 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.370
 car 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.709
 the most practical and economical is 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.190
 just a piece of pvc tube from 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:22.459
 40 mm consume with your clamp 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.970
 and a flange to attach it to the car in 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.970
 this case 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.880
 it's pretty tight 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.870
 and we would only change the one we have seen 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:39.250
 before this, if we use this type 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.250
 of irons 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:03.390
 a carrying case for the rods 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:04.620
 It is made of 110 pvc tube under 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:09.590
 has a stopper 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.590
 stuck and from above we have a red zone 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.230
 in it I put my two rods of three 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.480
 stretches perfectly is very practical 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.449
 for trips on the bus with smu's 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:23.139
 fishing and there's always something going 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:23.139
 hitting 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.100
 It is quite economical 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:36.340
 then we occupied a small house with 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.340
 some rivets 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:44.110
 and we can take our reeds with all 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:44.110
 security 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.380
 I will explain to you with a mounted yours 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:02.020
 own wheel the material that is needed 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:02.020
 it's a hilti lane piece 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.570
 to rail nuts 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:13.590
 and the wheel that you are going to use from air to 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:16.729
 two types this has a more profile 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:20.340
 narrow that is the one that you must put 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:22.910
 because this being wider is more 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.910
 weak 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.530
 and here you can see the operation of 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.530
 the door 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:40.139
 the nuts come in different metric 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:43.560
 for the asparagus 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:46.249
 I advise you to use nuts 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.249
 metric 10 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:55.320
 first we must 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:59.910
 of screwing a piece of rod from the 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:02.790
 appropriate metric and drop it 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:05.690
 because if not the piece at the end just 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.690
 breaking through here 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:13.849
 here you can see in the wheel that I use 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:15.249
 welding in this case welding 

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:18.869
 electric 

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:18.869
 once we have 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:28.529
 welded the piece of rod 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:31.669
 we just have to attach it to the wheel 

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:31.669
 by welding 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:42.360
 with the precaution of 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:42.360
 give the necessary form or placement 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:57.450
 me in this case to my wheel that is equal 

00:06:50.760 --> 00:07:00.710
 to this I have cut the chassis so that 

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.710
 do not see so much iron 

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:11.740
 to finish our wheel assembly 

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:14.340
 we can only weld a piece of rail 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:16.830
 On our side 

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:20.790
 I in this case use solder for 

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:24.590
 metal with the precaution of giving the 

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:28.080
 adequate tilt since if we put 

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:29.970
 then the lane very down to the 

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:33.630
 place the wheel will stay very 

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:36.919
 inclined with the danger that the car 

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:36.919
 roll over 

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:44.370
 and 

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:46.700
 This system is very suitable when 

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:50.910
 we have to walk 

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:53.070
 a long distance on firm ground and 

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:57.170
 that the wheel when I reach the sand 

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:57.170
 I just take it off
