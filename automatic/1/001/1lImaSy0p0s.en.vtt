00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.780
 Talk to me, Gurizada. Beauty is fine. 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.150
 to the salary of engineers

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.160
 February Wednesday we are coming back 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.010
 at the carnival fair 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.529
 I'm going to have a good rest now it's 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.100
 time to work again is like taking the 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:31.050
 Crankcase gasket casting a site 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:33.390
 than 99 1.6 16 valves entering 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.200
 there to take the last just now 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:42.890
 yes the guy is thin and circus he has something 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.890
 of its 190 thousand kilometers 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.539
 I remember seeing it here, took some 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:53.789
 there is no valve cap and no 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:55.379
 Ignition distributor the side and it 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.280
 to be removed that the character also 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:05.580
 to remove the oil leak can 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:12.439
 see here is dirty accumulated until the 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:14.430
 marriage is seeing here of the singer and 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.650
 actor 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.350
 the exchange itself lost the steering wheel of the 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.340
 engine is just like on the gasket itself. 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.830
 also because he is a little bit 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.570
 circled on the back to see and to here 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:30.240
 It's also decided it's strange, right? 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:34.650
 at the time one of the screws here of our 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:38.460
 face had rounded it had been 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:42.450
 a bit bad to get out and take in a house 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.939
 health next to the pool here where 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.600
 they have managed to loosen up and if this 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.460
 nut and bolt and we also already when 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.350
 we acquired special software there to 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.549
 that 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:59.850
 the staff is talking nonsense and 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:02.310
 about finding some difficulty 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.079
 to leave the service is not because of this 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.540
 to prevent the customer from spending 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.380
 unnecessarily with the resources that the 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.000
 people have here 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.830
 when something's missing 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.100
 now provide the tool there 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.690
 come on then let's take is muted 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.790
 disassemble what is needed here 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.800
 in order to reach the crankcase and start the 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.210
 out and I'm going to comment on this 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.270
 underneath, right? 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.950
 It's very clean here. 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.560
 then open the way to start 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.900
 and the guinea pigs and screws 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.690
 crankcase 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.830
 and what has hinted it here 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.730
 it seems that the leak is from the very 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:44.780
 Join me and look inside. 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:48.350
 torque converter the steering wheel is the most 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:52.400
 clean it up there then how 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:54.110
 here is an oil droplet formed in 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:59.420
 July 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:03.290
 he makes the whole return with a universe of 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:06.170
 Oil will understand that the joint 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:10.160
 anything related to last 70 or not this 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:12.560
 the engine has to be removed to 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.200
 replace what is needed right 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.110
 but the air will then open of our beautiful 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.690
 crankcase to collect this oil in a container 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.760
 clean because it will be reused 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.680
 after all, you have very little time to 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.600
 history has been replaced 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.459
 it will be reused there because the 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:34.700
 people did not request it 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:37.190
 then put it there with the new joint then 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.980
 because right direitinha 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:43.340
 preferably without leakage of details 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:47.150
 the engine inside is relatively 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:52.820
 fairly clean just this patent right 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:54.740
 too stuck nothing to truth as 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.380
 on top 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.570
 it's foul to clean the face of the block here in 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.920
 down not yet done nothing for 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.080
 low 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:10.940
 I'm working on tv falls and still there. 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:12.740
 I'll show you guys, but then the promoter. 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:18.489
 with that mileage 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:18.489
 It's very interesting then, for you. 

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:32.000
 Look at the way the new gasket is flexible 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:36.320
 look and just look at the hard plastic 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.380
 almost window from house to house she here in 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:42.260
 track and do not confuse it has no glue here is 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:45.920
 the joint itself which has attached itself to the crankcase and 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:50.030
 now it's coming out this way 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:52.040
 But that's it 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:56.150
 the letter is also very clean nec 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:59.000
 good trace but that's it 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:02.920
 now then she left here it's time to 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.920
 brush all this track 15 thousand 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:10.070
 after tying everything right to 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:11.780
 easy come on the block with new gasket and 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:16.700
 apply the bolts and nuts with the 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:19.520
 correct parent of the already cleaned block 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:22.520
 contaminated snow and our portfolio 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:26.600
 here is also a great job that gave 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:31.880
 and together now everything is clean and these 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:33.850
 here is little black ink is actually that 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.260
 will not get in the way 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.150
 The more you can do better 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:42.170
 But as to this, it's quiet here. 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:46.970
 Let's put the new one together then she's 

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:49.390
 is stuck here on the engine first in the 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:52.450
 block is by the prisoners 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:57.680
 we have two good prisoners over there 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:06:00.050
 but here né in the center where the first 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.570
 then come with a wallet and what does the 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:07.090
 marriage 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:10.449
 the torque of the bolts 6 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:12.880
 river tones plus 12 nilton are two steps 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:14.800
 is a first step with six with the 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.810
 second stage with 12 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:23.590
 come on then carter already installed 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:29.130
 topiado right 6000 over 12 000 tones and shades 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:29.130
 the postman's stopper here with 39 newtons 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:36.430
 all right 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:38.680
 now here to clean here and finish 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:41.410
 what you need to do is supply the 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:43.830
 card is an oil is that our children 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:46.830
 it's just everyone 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:48.630
 no trace of oil leakage 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:52.620
 now down here also by the radinho 

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:54.180
 sequinho is nothing drips on look at 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.890
 customer house you were a state 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.230
 very fabulous and gets restless 

00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:00.530
 wash ne 

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:00.530
 but that's it 

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:06.840
 and when sealed in the exhaust all 

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:06.840
 right 

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:16.020
 today I 'm monitoring myself, he's going 

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:18.000
 escape and also the leak is 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:20.310
 stabilize our circus is not so 

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.139
 leaks do not do a good job take 

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:24.960
 that junta of cairo it ended up running 

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:27.330
 in the carné and had no presence of 

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.750
 silicone is by time of use same time 

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:31.919
 life of the piece is but ultimately 

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:34.440
 screws because God damn right 

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:36.090
 our face and underwent several 

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:38.130
 temperature regimes 

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:39.660
 It's fine, it works fine, then it stops. 

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:42.540
 and it went back to working again of judgment 

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:44.820
 indigo and denim and no trace of 

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:46.770
 Now leak the information from the 

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:48.000
 customer will then be careful case 

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:49.800
 it will leak 

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.530
 we pay attention but I think it was 

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:56.100
 just the thing of the board even calm everything 

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:58.500
 short little video beauty then there nor 

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:59.550
 Carnival return but that's it 

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.260
 there's more tomorrow 

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:03.120

 hug until the next video
