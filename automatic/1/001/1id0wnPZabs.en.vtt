00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 who deal with are welcome once 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.569
 more and another 25 and this time we're 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.700
 in a new video tutorial to bring them 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.650
 how to increase the fps 60 infor 3 as already 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.900
 will have seen in the title for those who 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.490
 do not know the fps are the boxes by 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.070
 second that has the game then if 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.199
 we increase them we will have pictures by 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.029
 second more fluids then so 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.250
 we can play better we can see when 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.230
 they attack us etc. not like that if we had 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.730
 I do not know about 10 frames per second 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.170
 we would see almost nothing 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.550
 we would go little by little then it would be 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.250
 easier to be killed and so on 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.840
 etcetera and obviously this increases the 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.489
 frames per second can make you 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.670
 increase your skill too or 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.410
 just to let you carry permit 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.070
 your ability to the fullest before maybe 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.760
 you could not and you had less fps and I do not know why 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.769
 what did this 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.379
 ok the first thing we're going to do is going to be 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:51.969
 go to this page were let in 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.430
 description as always the links are 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:56.769
 down there for anything we're going to go 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.930
 where it says zip to reebok of finnair and 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:01.329
 liz there we are going to click on it and it's going to 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.879
 download a file this file and I 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.239
 I'm going to leave here on the desk that 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.239
 I had it 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.860
 it is a copy to replace that is the same 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.350
 although this file as I say I 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.630
 I feel for my accent let's open it with 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.149
 winrar or something I have winrar because I am 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.890
 poor then let's open the folder 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.740
 that comes here and what we 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.479
 we want is the max frames file the 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.159
 of max quality would be for you to wear 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.600
 this reports to the highest quality but 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.759
 Well basically this would be the opposite 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.039
 we are not going to take it to quality anymore 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.479
 low to run very fast then 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:35.240
 we will drag this file to 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.090
 desk 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.590
 and here we have it ok because this file 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.110
 it comes without format then let's give it 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.790
 right click properties and let's go 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:50.720
 rename the car without capital letters auto 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:54.080
 exec point cfg enter and we are already 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.020
 would convert to a cfg type file let's go 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.909
 to open it and as you can see all this comes 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.830
 text this do not want to change it unless 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.119
 that you already know more or less 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.039
 the configurations in this case yes 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.720
 they could change it for what we 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.080
 we are interested in copying this coming 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.720
 here 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.330
 because we're going to insert that later 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.970
 right now let's give copy ce Control 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.940
 ok now what we are going to do is going to be 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.930
 go to steam in our library 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.200
 we're going to right click on team 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.530
 fortress properties let's go to the 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.200
 local files tab and we're going to 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.790
 Click on view local files once 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.280
 here we are going to click on the folder of 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.280
 efe then cfg and 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:41.200
 this 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:43.300
 let's move it to the cfg folder though 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.930
 there is nothing else we would leave the file 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.850
 We go again to close the window 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.010
 we had open of team fortress let's go 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.930
 to the general tab set options 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.860
 of launch and now yes there we paste 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.740
 all we have right now copy the 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.810
 file in this part where it says with is 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:05.920
 this is the width of our screen 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:08.709
 our resolution in my case is thousand 366 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.470
 let's put 768 in my case you already 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:14.230
 would put there for example in 1280 and 720 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:17.200
 it depends on each one what we 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.270
 will have to close and now if we go to 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.650
 open team fortes I hope that I do not 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.910
 I exploded right now as I'm recording with 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.350
 the cam are you already 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.270
 once we open team fortress 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.630
 we have to check that it comes out here in 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.760
 the console I'm here stay with fix 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.440
 crisis max frame config loader that 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.690
 means that the configuration is already 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.130
 charged then this should be 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.420
 correctly right now then 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.270
 we can calmly close the team 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.860
 fortress 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.450
 then how was this the first time 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.010
 that we open team fortress using this 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.020
 configuration we have to go back to 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.450
 our library give a right click on 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.490
 team fortress properties set 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.870
 launch options and there we go to 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.780
 erase what we have put right now 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.040
 of excel 81 we leave the rest and what 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.260
 we can leave because it does not affect in 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.820
 absolute but this nothing else is required 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.020
 the first time we launch team 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.140
 fortress using this configuration 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.490
 then let's remove it we go ok and 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.980
 now we will have our team 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.030
 fortress ready to have fps jumps 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.700
 It's also already obvious from your 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.670
 computer but I for example be in 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.130
 Average configuration reached about 30 to 20 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.560
 fps and with this configuration came up 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.180
 100 120 etcetera what you can see a 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.920
 small example in hightower of how 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.810
 is the serious configuration this does 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.970
 a few days this plane what used then 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.780
 to show them more or less how 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.780
 this configuration 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.110
 Now let's say that for some reason 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.570
 configuration did not work for you or you did not like it 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.490
 you do not like how it looks and so on 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.040
 you have a reason to uninstall the and 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.229
 you do not want this to uninstall the 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.210
 basically we have to go to our 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:03.330
 Right info library 3 right click 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.610
 properties local files see 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:09.090
 local files and let's go to the 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:11.460
 df cfg folder and let's delete the 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.250
 auto exe file that we give suppress 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.900
 if we want to erase it and then we go back 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.169
 to our library the properties 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.970
 team fortress general sets options 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:24.380
 of launch and there 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:29.220
 we would add a command that would say hyphen 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:31.330
 auto config well this way we would give 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.409
 ok close 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.369
 and we will launch 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:36.369
 team fortress 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.980
 and here in team fortress we will not have 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.780
 that doing nothing was only necessary 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.920
 basically open it what we did with 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.960
 that command in the options of 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.000
 launch was to make the game 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.890
 return to factory options by 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.110
 put it like this to the recommended options 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.580
 for your system and that will no longer be 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:57.270
 trace so to speak of the 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.350
 configuration of maximum fps is what 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.760
 then here I would not have to do 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.740
 nothing could simply close if 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.600
 you want to care about you, I hope you like them 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.340
