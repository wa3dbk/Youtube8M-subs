basically<00:00:10.320> like<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.860> BitFenix<00:00:11.040> alchemy<00:00:11.790> LED

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
basically like the BitFenix alchemy LED

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.629 
basically like the BitFenix alchemy LED
strips<00:00:12.509> but<00:00:12.870> cheaper<00:00:13.590> sort<00:00:13.980> of<00:00:14.070> they're

alchemy<00:00:16.590> strips<00:00:16.830> you<00:00:16.949> can<00:00:16.980> link<00:00:17.220> them

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
alchemy strips you can link them

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.429 
alchemy strips you can link them
together<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:18.270> they're<00:00:18.480> all<00:00:18.510> powered<00:00:19.080> by<00:00:19.109> a

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
together and they're all powered by a

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.040 
together and they're all powered by a
4-pin<00:00:20.070> molex<00:00:20.119> so<00:00:21.119> I'm<00:00:21.240> going<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.449> get<00:00:21.570> into<00:00:21.750> it

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
4-pin molex so I'm going to get into it

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.330 
4-pin molex so I'm going to get into it
here<00:00:22.230> if<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.380> can<00:00:22.500> just<00:00:22.650> get<00:00:22.800> this<00:00:22.890> little<00:00:23.160> knife

so yeah so now I'm going to jump

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.639 
so yeah so now I'm going to jump
straight<00:01:00.480> into<00:01:00.629> my<00:01:00.750> PC<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.109> show<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.500> how<00:01:01.590> to

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
straight into my PC to show you how to

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.110 
straight into my PC to show you how to
install<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.340> installation<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.059> pretty

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
install it so installation is pretty

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.789 
install it so installation is pretty
easy<00:01:03.510> basically<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.110> just<00:01:04.140> get<00:01:04.320> your<00:01:04.439> LED

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
easy basically you just get your LED

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.609 
easy basically you just get your LED
strip<00:01:05.070> flicks<00:01:05.970> light<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.450> find<00:01:07.350> out<00:01:07.470> where

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
strip flicks light and find out where

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.620 
strip flicks light and find out where
you<00:01:07.680> want<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.920> position<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.520> on<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.700> case<00:01:09.030> now

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
you want to position it on the case now

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.780 
you want to position it on the case now
the<00:01:09.689> place<00:01:09.990> I'd<00:01:10.200> usually<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:11.220> know<00:01:11.340> recommend

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
the place I'd usually you know recommend

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.850 
the place I'd usually you know recommend
is<00:01:11.939> somewhere<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:13.049> cannot<00:01:13.350> see<00:01:13.650> the

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
is somewhere that you cannot see the

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.010 
is somewhere that you cannot see the
LEDs<00:01:14.280> themselves<00:01:14.549> but<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.450> can<00:01:15.600> see<00:01:15.840> the

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
LEDs themselves but you can see the

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.170 
LEDs themselves but you can see the
light<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.470> know<00:01:16.680> being<00:01:17.400> cast<00:01:17.640> from<00:01:17.790> them<00:01:18.030> so

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
light you know being cast from them so

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.520 
light you know being cast from them so
they<00:01:18.270> can<00:01:18.420> shine<00:01:18.630> out<00:01:18.810> but<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.110> don't<00:01:19.320> see

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
they can shine out but you don't see

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.649 
they can shine out but you don't see
them<00:01:19.710> through<00:01:20.250> your<00:01:20.460> windows<00:01:20.880> side<00:01:21.150> panel<00:01:21.540> so

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
them through your windows side panel so

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.240 
them through your windows side panel so
the<00:01:22.049> place<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.229> I'm<00:01:22.470> going<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.680> put<00:01:22.830> mine<00:01:22.979> is

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
the place that I'm going to put mine is

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.460 
the place that I'm going to put mine is
actually<00:01:23.729> up<00:01:23.909> on<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.210> roof<00:01:24.420> here<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.900> going

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
actually up on the roof here and going

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.679 
actually up on the roof here and going
down<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.920> side<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.460> so<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.420> do<00:01:27.570> this

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
down the side and so to do this

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.950 
down the side and so to do this
literally<00:01:28.020> we<00:01:28.229> can<00:01:28.350> just<00:01:28.500> peel<00:01:28.710> off<00:01:28.860> our<00:01:29.070> 3m

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
literally we can just peel off our 3m

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.010 
literally we can just peel off our 3m
adhesive<00:01:30.960> strip<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:32.630> position<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.750> first

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
adhesive strip and position the first

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.340 
adhesive strip and position the first
bit<00:01:34.350> up<00:01:34.829> here<00:01:34.890> on<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.700> roof<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.630> just<00:01:37.110> sort<00:01:37.320> of
