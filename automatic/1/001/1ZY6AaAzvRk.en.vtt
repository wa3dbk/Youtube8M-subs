 much ps the time of 30 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.230
 in the m performance variant brings 326 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.540
 ps on the rear wheels and that can 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.230
 ever look like that because who tries 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.779
 the 450 newton meters force unlimited 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.609
 and other electronic driving aids 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.529
 to transform nimbly propulsion 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.590
 he can ever be in his own 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.800
 little ones stand with esp in the sport plus 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.719
 attitude he creates in the 235 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.050
 eight-speed tiptronic the hundreds brand 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.200
 easy sprinting in 4.8 seconds afterwards 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.930
 he without batting an eye at the 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.120
 He could certainly be too fast 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.770
 he does not 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.500
 driving pleasure is in the super agile and 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.629
 maneuvering two guarantees in curves 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.460
 he literally dives in and 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.530
 Plows through the exact fit on 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.219
 turn exit again rumble ride 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.739
 take 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.780
 Highlight is a torque- feeling 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.030
 mechanical locking differential in 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.850
 Hinterachsgetriebe that still provides 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.229
 disabled dsc for optimal 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.360
 distribution of power between the 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.460
 rear wheels 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.740
 the chassis is in the m variant two 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.689
 centimeters lower that ensures 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.119
 a deep focus of the high 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.040
 bend speeds allowed the 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.020
 performer is so deep that there and 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.630
 again deep in Sagittarius in danger 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.009
 to scratch over the asphalt 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.290
 behind the tax you can tell from all this 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.400
 nothing is all right here kommod 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:35.729
 Nevertheless, the m edition of the 235 is everything 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.860
 just not sensible the 45 liters super 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.290
 which can fit into the tank under 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.659
 exploiting its potential 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.630
 be away pretty fast and for one 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.579
 relatively tight added really sporty 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.690
 equipped with a few extras that 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.340
 coupe 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.500
 You have to spend 50,000 euros to 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.380
 one and want to another before 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.180
 can afford everything 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.860
 but in pure driving after this 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.530
 car are a lot of fun 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.360
 the sound arrives in such a strange and funny way 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.170
 if just dosed right 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.170
 ears feasting 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.320
 the chassis is sporty nearing 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.400
 Did it just fits the car 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.160
 bigger tours are thanks to the 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.420
 very good fast 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.820
 responsive damper anyway 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.920
 no problem at all 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.900
 back pain gets nobody here 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.820
 sitting behind the wheel can be 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.950
 thanks to the good sports seats for the 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.050
 make most people fit if you 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.820
 now that alcantara leather on the steering wheel 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.600
 and divide the dashboard well 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.520
 finds or not 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.860
 only at speeds over 200 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.780
 km h, it will be something when going straight 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.910
 restless but no fear 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.270
 Everything stays green 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:49.120
 there is no danger of the two 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.920
 is for two ideally occupied two persons 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.989
 have ample space for yourself and that 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.450
 Luggage especially the trunk with a 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:58.600
 volume of almost 400 liters for the 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.310
 Size of the car is pretty abundant in case 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.380
 it should not be enough then stand 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.989
 the back seats to the emergency also still to 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.150
 disposal can sit here adults 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.130
 people will only be short of it anyway 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.730
 no one comes up with the idea of four 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.730
 travel long 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:18.430
 the bmw m 2 35 is not a car for 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.680
 normalos a certain car enthusiasm 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.610
 and the willingness to refuel more often 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.090
 belong to 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:27.550
 who he likes and can afford this 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.030
 but something special two much fun 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.030
 to have
