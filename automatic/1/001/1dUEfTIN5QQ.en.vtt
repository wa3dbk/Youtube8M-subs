00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
started to come between their planet and

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.650 
started to come between their planet and
Earth<00:00:53.219> about<00:00:54.980> 450,000<00:00:55.980> years<00:00:56.160> ago<00:00:56.600> why<00:00:57.600> do

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
Earth about 450,000 years ago why do

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.260 
Earth about 450,000 years ago why do
they<00:00:58.109> look<00:00:58.289> like<00:00:58.350> us<00:00:59.899> we<00:01:00.899> look<00:01:01.140> like<00:01:01.170> them

there<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:22.280> scientific<00:01:23.280> terms<00:01:24.000> but<00:01:24.420> let's

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
there is a scientific terms but let's

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.380 
there is a scientific terms but let's
say<00:01:24.869> with<00:01:25.080> with<00:01:25.259> early<00:01:25.710> hominids<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.520> bring

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
say with with early hominids to bring

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.660 
say with with early hominids to bring
about<00:01:27.680> Homo<00:01:28.680> sapiens<00:01:29.400> us<00:01:30.890> you<00:01:31.890> know<00:01:32.040> the

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
about Homo sapiens us you know the

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.340 
about Homo sapiens us you know the
father<00:01:32.939> talking<00:01:33.329> about<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.720> evolution<00:01:33.990> of

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
man and creationism and Darwin if I mean

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.590 
man and creationism and Darwin if I mean
I<00:01:37.140> got<00:01:37.350> calls<00:01:37.710> four<00:01:38.100> days<00:01:38.520> after<00:01:39.000> you're<00:01:39.329> here

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
I got calls four days after you're here

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.170 
I got calls four days after you're here
this<00:01:39.780> really<00:01:40.140> piques<00:01:40.979> people's<00:01:41.579> interest

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
this really piques people's interest

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.660 
this really piques people's interest
well<00:01:43.110> let's<00:01:43.409> start<00:01:43.710> with<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:44.040> because<00:01:44.250> most

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
well let's start with that because most

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.520 
well let's start with that because most
people<00:01:45.090> either<00:01:45.240> follow<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.899> category<00:01:46.439> of

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
people either follow the category of

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.399 
people either follow the category of
thinking<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:48.210> know<00:01:48.270> creationism<00:01:49.200> God

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
thinking that you know creationism God

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.830 
thinking that you know creationism God
created<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.159> earth<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.520> man<00:01:50.790> or<00:01:51.030> Darwinism

that so this looks like that we know the
