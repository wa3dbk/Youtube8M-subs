00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
within the first couple of years so I

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.390 
within the first couple of years so I
think<00:04:13.580> what<00:04:13.730> we<00:04:13.850> do<00:04:14.140> is<00:04:15.140> very<00:04:15.230> particular<00:04:15.890> and

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
think what we do is very particular and

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.680 
think what we do is very particular and
it's<00:04:16.580> about<00:04:16.790> it's<00:04:17.150> definitely<00:04:17.269> about

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
it's about it's definitely about

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.300 
it's about it's definitely about
empowering<00:04:18.169> people<00:04:18.440> giving<00:04:19.070> them<00:04:19.160> options

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
empowering people giving them options

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.400 
empowering people giving them options
but<00:04:20.150> also<00:04:20.269> it's<00:04:20.540> more<00:04:20.690> than<00:04:20.810> that<00:04:20.930> it's<00:04:21.080> oh<00:04:21.229> it

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
but also it's more than that it's oh it

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.050 
but also it's more than that it's oh it
is<00:04:21.590> love<00:04:21.919> and<00:04:22.070> passion<00:04:22.430> and<00:04:22.550> an<00:04:22.610> i<00:04:22.700> it<00:04:22.760> sort<00:04:23.000> of

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
is love and passion and an i it sort of

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.960 
is love and passion and an i it sort of
sounds<00:04:23.630> a<00:04:23.840> little<00:04:23.930> bit<00:04:24.169> sort<00:04:24.440> of<00:04:24.500> romantic<00:04:25.490> but

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
sounds a little bit sort of romantic but

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.659 
sounds a little bit sort of romantic but
I<00:04:26.150> think<00:04:26.600> you<00:04:26.720> know<00:04:26.810> that<00:04:26.960> China<00:04:27.830> get<00:04:28.340> people

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
I think you know that China get people

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:31.480 
I think you know that China get people
to<00:04:28.820> see<00:04:29.090> why<00:04:29.990> you<00:04:30.050> love<00:04:30.440> something<00:04:30.710> why<00:04:31.250> would

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
to see why you love something why would

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.040 
to see why you love something why would
you<00:04:31.610> want<00:04:31.820> to<00:04:31.880> get<00:04:32.030> up<00:04:32.150> on<00:04:32.390> this<00:04:32.540> cold<00:04:32.780> morning

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
you want to get up on this cold morning

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:39.780 
you want to get up on this cold morning
and<00:04:33.380> do<00:04:33.500> a<00:04:33.530> 40-minute<00:04:34.190> shift<00:04:34.430> you<00:04:35.270> know

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.150 

the<00:04:39.970> big<00:04:40.150> society<00:04:40.570> thing<00:04:40.750> and<00:04:41.020> I<00:04:41.590> think<00:04:41.980> even

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
the big society thing and I think even

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.740 
the big society thing and I think even
the<00:04:42.400> Conservatives<00:04:42.940> are<00:04:43.090> kind<00:04:43.360> of<00:04:43.480> wishing

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
the Conservatives are kind of wishing

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.610 
the Conservatives are kind of wishing
they'd<00:04:43.900> never<00:04:44.080> said<00:04:44.320> it<00:04:44.650> now<00:04:45.310> quite<00:04:45.760> like<00:04:45.940> that

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
they'd never said it now quite like that

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.320

would be good just to get back on your

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.000 
would be good just to get back on your
scooter<00:05:43.000> and<00:05:43.330> and<00:05:43.540> fix<00:05:44.230> up<00:05:44.380> a<00:05:44.470> bowl<00:05:44.650> of<00:05:44.800> pasta

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.010

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.640 
scooter and and fix up a bowl of pasta
but<00:05:45.340> that's<00:05:45.720> yeah<00:05:46.720> I'm<00:05:46.870> certainly<00:05:47.230> easy<00:05:47.440> it

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
but that's yeah I'm certainly easy it

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.290 
but that's yeah I'm certainly easy it
would<00:05:47.740> be<00:05:47.770> easy<00:05:48.250> wouldn't<00:05:48.610> it<00:05:48.760> but<00:05:48.970> I<00:05:49.000> kind<00:05:49.270> of

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
would be easy wouldn't it but I kind of

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.450 
would be easy wouldn't it but I kind of
think<00:05:49.450> that's<00:05:49.720> not<00:05:50.380> really<00:05:50.710> what<00:05:50.920> we've<00:05:51.100> grown

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
think that's not really what we've grown

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.450 
think that's not really what we've grown
into<00:05:51.730> I<00:05:52.290> think<00:05:53.290> we<00:05:53.410> have<00:05:53.530> a<00:05:53.560> sort<00:05:53.860> of<00:05:53.920> comfort
