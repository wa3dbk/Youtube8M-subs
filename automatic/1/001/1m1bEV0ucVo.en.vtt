00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.740
 volvo xc90 is quite an interesting case with 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.450
 in terms of marketing 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.549
 the fact is that the first generation model 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.379
 appeared 12 years ago and not 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.060
 still sold brand fans 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.160
 explain it to the fact that the car turned out 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.689
 very good on the other hand for that 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.430
 time the owners made up pretty 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.109
 long list of chronic problems 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.500
 about the most common we are now 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.300
 tell us we got a crossover 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.309
 restyled seventh year run 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.710
 a hundred forty with a few thousand kilometers 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.800
 4 4 motor v8 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.770
 power 315 horses more than enough price 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.719
 question 688 thousand rubles owner 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:48.809
 assures that you followed the car 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:50.760
 about passed during generally at first 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.649
 the car seems frankly boring but 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.690
 only as long as not well 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.870
 you press the gas pedal under the hood with us 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.469
 a huge v8 of 4 4 and dynamics 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.559
 motor 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.219
 not a pensioner at all true appetite 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.140
 at Ksyusha 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.860
 so affectionately call this car yourself 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.310
 owners inhuman 25 liters in 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.210
 the city 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:15.340
 moreover, for iksi 90 speak the usual thing 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.680
 at least with a v8 engine for sure 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.810
 consumption of the most popular in Russia 25 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.729
 turbo is definitely smaller but in this 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.740
 case with the cost of doing so so 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.290
 but note excellent visibility and 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.180
 smooth driving xc90 convenient 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.540
 Immediately get used to anything 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.700
 no need 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.370
 2002, the car went through several 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.380
 restyling new options appeared but 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.020
 the whole interior is the last century 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.660
 especially in a car of this class on the other 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.940
 hand quality materials at the level and 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.920
 even after a run of 140 thousand 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.120
 kilometers of some squeaks from the bags 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.120
 inside I can't hear 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.050
 and what about the technical nodes 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.030
 go to the comprehensive diagnosis first 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.370
 we look at the engine immediately say 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.680
 atmospheric v8 gay very exotic 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.050
 but simple and straightforward to maintain and 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.040
 no one complains that over time the motor 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.040
 starts to eat butter 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.099
 the main place board is the pillars 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.020
 engine 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.480
 many people think that this is not happening 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.349
 because of the heavy weight of the motor, but I think 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.599
 what is this happening because 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.610
 constructive location associated with 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.260
 security because when the front 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.560
 blow engine must go under 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.690
 car and volvo owners in 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.610
 security has to pay so that 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.099
 you have to change the engine mount more often 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.550
 on the 0 car game there is also 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:36.769
 problem areas from the steering rack on this 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.390
 problems with the chassis do not end more often 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.730
 just like they write on club forums 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.989
 change the wheel bearings have to us 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.790
 By the way, they also advised 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.640
 ofitsialov item is only in the collection 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.769
 costs about 10,000 rubles about 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.870
 all-wheel drive there is one helpful tip 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.810
 Change the oil in the clutch and rear gearbox 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.850
 every 50 thousand kilometers after 80 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.069
 fluid turn into oil trouble 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.140
 not long in coming yet another 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.330
 differential module differential module 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.640
 not only that often refuses so it 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.769
 still and steal the item is quite expensive 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.720
 on withdrawal is not difficult that 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.580
 As for the box, the automatic crossovers 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.769
 considered reliable on time 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.850
 change oil about once every 60 thousand 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:18.410
 kilometers the main problem is 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:22.970
 solenoid valve on the brain is good 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:25.430
 but I attribute this complexity to general 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.880
 problems related to electronics in 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.930
 all valvos it so happened that all 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.300
 electronic mechanisms 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:37.750
 This brand has minor flaws 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.910
 Many craftsmen are solved by 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.120
 programming experiences and so on 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.860
 for my taste this is quite a reasonable decision 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.750
 in our case the master discovered the leak 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.790
 gearbox drive gearbox nothing 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.190
 serious no longer found despite 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.440
 This is the declared 315 horses motor already 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.420
 hardly subjectively gives no less 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.060
 ten percent power he lost 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.090
 real acceleration to one hundred and eight seconds but 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.579
 fuel consumption is generally a headache 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.620
 25 liters in the city per hundred head 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:07.060
 pain is called by many and electrics on 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.019
 every second car burns out 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.239
 fog lights 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:11.920
 This setting is treated by installing smaller bulbs 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.500
 power various sensors 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.910
 longevity is also not famous most often 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.250
 break pedal position sensor 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.470
 accelerator steering position sensor 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.330
 and oxygen sensors last yet 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.370
 worth decently scolded and rear 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.990
 Parktronic which after washing and sometimes 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:30.370
 and just rain start to go crazy 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.030
 complete list of problems and recommendations 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.770
 us on hand 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.940
 it's time to read how much you need 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.919
 invest money to eliminate everything 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.830
 shortcomings and what will be beneficial for 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:41.080
 compared to buying a new car 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:43.210
 Recall our 7 years no evolve costs 688 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.340
 thousand rubles to bring her in 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.740
 perfect condition you need to spend 15 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.660
 thousands to repair the engine running for another 30 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.080
 remove cosmetic defects outside and 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.669
 inside 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.950
 in the end, the real price of the car 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.660
 will be 700 33 thousand rubles 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.700
 as for buying a new car 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.860
 second generation models promise 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.510
 release only at the end of the year so have 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.430
 dealers can still be purchased 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.080
 good old crossover survivor 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.050
 several plastic surgeries 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.639
 v8 engine is no longer for sale now 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.289
 the most powerful option is petrol 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.900
 five-cylinder let's drink turbo 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:15.669
 but that drive as we will not have yes 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.770
 and the difference in fuel consumption does not seem 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:20.440
 Huge similar picking machine 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.750
 worth 2 million 99 thousand rubles and so 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.430
 benefit when buying a used xc90 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.200
 considering the money spent on repairs 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.880
 will be 1 million three hundred sixty 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.010
 six thousand rubles 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.930
 According to statistics, four out of five owner 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.640
 fix 90 happy with my car 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.860
 they appreciate the comfort of spaciousness and 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.960
 security well, and most often complains about 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.610
 high cost of service is not the best 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.650
 manageability harsh for Russian 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.030
 roads suspension given that new 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.560
 the generation of the model on the market is not yet 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:48.600
 There was a purchase of a crossover on 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.600
 secondary market solution is quite reasonable
