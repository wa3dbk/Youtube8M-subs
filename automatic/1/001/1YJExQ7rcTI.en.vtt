00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.660
 Hello good day, eighty percent of 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.599
 territory are part of the 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.940
 northeastern region with low 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.009
 dry rainfall index 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.699
 factors that hamper the supply of 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.250
 of drinking water and there is another 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.369
 in the state are common sources of 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.529
 water with high salinization content, which 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.630
 impossible to consume more 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.699
 researchers from Ceará developed 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.969
 an efficient and low- cost alternative 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:36.239
 cost to make brackish water 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.520
 drinking water is a vital resource for 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.890
 for living beings in the Ceará 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.079
 climatic characteristics marked by the 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.149
 low rainfall levels compromise the 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.030
 rural communities supply 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.190
 coexist with water shortages but this 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.800
 not the only problem is the question of 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.469
 salinity also worries and 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.440
 calls for technology help is one of the most 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.379
 The desalinators are the most efficient 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.649
 equipment makes brackish water 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.989
 drinkable 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.880
 the problem is the cost each appliance can 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.119
 reach 80 thousand reais 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.590
 not to mention maintenance costs 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.360
 more university researchers 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.439
 federal government of Ceará found 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.540
 alternative 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.189
 after eight years of studies 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.770
 performed in the laboratory of 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.380
 physics-chemistry of minerals and catalysis 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.659
 department of organic chemistry they 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.680
 found a more economical solution 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.150
 of water purification a well having 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.040
 in view of the fact that the raw material of the copy 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.680
 also obtained a white powder which is the 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.259
 kaolin and this material he has 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.420
 effectively the property of treating the 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.810
 water and in the direction of 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.570
 quality of life to calcium and magnesium 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.570
 which are the causative chemical species 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.520
 of water 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.950
 according to the researchers the process of 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.600
 desalination is simple 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.820
 they simulated for us 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.280
 the sample of water that came from santa 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.100
 in the sertão of Ceará is placed 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.650
 this unit makes it the photometer 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.810
 reading of the salts present in the water was 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.410
 a high level of 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.560
 salinity in contact with the white powder 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.270
 insoluble 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.819
 water passes through a kind of 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.140
 filtration that greatly reduces 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.660
 salinity 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.830
 if we take for example a water tank 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:26.190
 of a thousand liters and that in this water tank 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:29.970
 containing the untreated water in 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:32.010
 we produced this stabilizer with a 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.739
 the five- minute gestation in the 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.260
 and leave them at rest and singing. 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.840
 or if you prefer to filter it was the extraction 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.090
 simple though recommended before using 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.220
 a filter paper because the pole has 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.370
 extremely fine particles and a 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.950
 not be enough and 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.660
 do this, the water would already be 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.660
 magnesium and therefore would not have 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.870
 more healthiness that sensation alone 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.950
 area of ​​a water and impossible to be 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.290
 consumed 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.570
 the indicator powder will begin to 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.620
 used in the coming months 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.720
 Ceará 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.850
 municipalities with the highest rates of 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.269
 salinization in water will be the first 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:15.660
 benefited central hinterland certainly 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:18.150
 Sobral region has a lot of problem in 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.299
 relation to water quality is the region 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:24.329
 near santa quiteria 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:27.180
 crates and also a year ago a region 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:29.190
 extremely problematic with regard to 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.680
 respect to the quality of well water 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.840
 for the researcher the investments 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.489
 Brazilians in researches help 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.170
 develop the techniques that can 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.130
 improve the quality of life of the 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.440
 population 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.989
 but it is still necessary to move forward in the 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.150
 put the results into practice what the 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:48.420
 people have seen the government having to 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.810
 investing high values ​​of resources 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:55.109
 to make it viable is a 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:58.100
 water treatment and therefore offer 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:04:00.600
 quality water for the 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.520
 to really do it here is a lot 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:07.320
 resource what we are bringing 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:11.050
 is a considerable reduction of costs 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.640
 so the population has the same 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.450
 result 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.450
 the storage
