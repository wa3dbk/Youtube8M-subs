00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
background and right here you can see me

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.230 
background and right here you can see me
changing<00:02:57.440> the<00:02:57.470> color<00:02:57.800> on<00:02:58.100> individual<00:02:59.000> layers

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
changing the color on individual layers

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.960 
changing the color on individual layers
I<00:03:00.050> can<00:03:00.560> make<00:03:00.680> them<00:03:00.800> darker<00:03:01.010> or<00:03:01.400> lighter<00:03:01.430> and

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
I can make them darker or lighter and

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.250 
I can make them darker or lighter and
that<00:03:02.480> is<00:03:02.600> amazing<00:03:03.260> for<00:03:03.500> doing<00:03:03.830> landscape

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
that is amazing for doing landscape

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.420 
that is amazing for doing landscape
illustrations<00:03:06.260> or<00:03:06.380> paintings<00:03:09.160> so<00:03:10.160> you<00:03:10.250> can

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
illustrations or paintings so you can

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.130 
illustrations or paintings so you can
see<00:03:10.610> right<00:03:10.640> here<00:03:11.060> I<00:03:11.360> have<00:03:11.540> a<00:03:11.570> really<00:03:11.870> dark

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
see right here I have a really dark

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.710 
see right here I have a really dark
foreground<00:03:12.710> the<00:03:13.670> mid-ground<00:03:14.060> is<00:03:14.420> kind<00:03:14.600> of<00:03:14.660> a

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
foreground the mid-ground is kind of a

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.360 
foreground the mid-ground is kind of a
mid-tone<00:03:15.140> and<00:03:15.500> then<00:03:15.620> the<00:03:15.680> background<00:03:16.250> is

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
mid-tone and then the background is

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.210 
mid-tone and then the background is
really<00:03:16.940> light<00:03:17.180> and<00:03:17.450> that's<00:03:18.200> generally<00:03:18.770> like

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
really light and that's generally like

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.800 
really light and that's generally like
consistent<00:03:19.760> with<00:03:19.850> atmospheric<00:03:20.090> perspective

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
consistent with atmospheric perspective

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.260 
consistent with atmospheric perspective
the<00:03:21.500> further<00:03:21.770> away<00:03:21.950> you<00:03:22.070> get<00:03:22.430> the<00:03:22.820> more<00:03:22.970> hazy

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
the further away you get the more hazy

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.390 
the further away you get the more hazy
things<00:03:23.690> are<00:03:23.960> and<00:03:24.230> that's<00:03:24.680> how<00:03:24.920> it<00:03:25.070> is<00:03:25.190> when

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
things are and that's how it is when

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.500 
things are and that's how it is when
you're<00:03:25.550> on<00:03:25.760> the<00:03:25.790> surface<00:03:26.480> of<00:03:26.720> the<00:03:27.350> world

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.210 

here<00:03:32.510> it's<00:03:32.750> underground<00:03:33.650> so<00:03:33.860> it's<00:03:34.010> a<00:03:34.040> bit

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
here it's underground so it's a bit

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.339 
here it's underground so it's a bit
tricky<00:03:34.459> the<00:03:35.180> million<00:03:35.480> light<00:03:35.659> source<00:03:35.930> is<00:03:36.140> going

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:36.349 
tricky the million light source is going

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.539 
tricky the million light source is going
to<00:03:36.409> be<00:03:36.500> this<00:03:36.620> lava<00:03:36.980> beneath<00:03:38.200> the<00:03:39.200> building<00:03:40.129> and

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
to be this lava beneath the building and

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:41.949 
to be this lava beneath the building and
everything<00:03:40.939> so<00:03:41.090> everything<00:03:41.299> is<00:03:41.480> really<00:03:41.629> dark

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
everything so everything is really dark

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.220 
everything so everything is really dark
and<00:03:42.260> shadowed<00:03:42.769> and<00:03:43.730> the<00:03:43.909> background<00:03:44.150> I<00:03:44.629> wasn't

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
and shadowed and the background I wasn't

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.839 
and shadowed and the background I wasn't
quite<00:03:45.409> sure<00:03:45.500> how<00:03:45.769> to<00:03:45.799> handle<00:03:45.890> this<00:03:46.340> because<00:03:46.670> i

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849 
quite sure how to handle this because i

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:48.369 
quite sure how to handle this because i
like<00:03:46.879> it<00:03:47.269> at<00:03:47.390> this<00:03:47.510> stage<00:03:47.720> but<00:03:47.870> i'm<00:03:47.989> like<00:03:48.140> i

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:48.379 
like it at this stage but i'm like i

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:50.199 
like it at this stage but i'm like i
think<00:03:48.859> i<00:03:49.069> need<00:03:49.159> to<00:03:49.340> make<00:03:49.579> that<00:03:49.760> background

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
think i need to make that background

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.089 
think i need to make that background
dark<00:03:50.659> like<00:03:51.109> even<00:03:51.439> though<00:03:51.530> it<00:03:51.650> goes<00:03:51.769> against

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 
dark like even though it goes against

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:53.920 
dark like even though it goes against
atmospheric<00:03:52.819> perspective<00:03:52.970> if<00:03:53.569> you're<00:03:53.720> in<00:03:53.840> a

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
atmospheric perspective if you're in a

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.170 
atmospheric perspective if you're in a
cave<00:03:54.200> and<00:03:54.590> there's<00:03:54.920> no<00:03:55.129> light<00:03:55.430> in<00:03:55.459> the<00:03:55.790> back<00:03:55.970> of

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
cave and there's no light in the back of

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.870 
cave and there's no light in the back of
this<00:03:56.269> cave<00:03:56.799> it's<00:03:57.799> going<00:03:58.040> to<00:03:58.069> be<00:03:58.189> pitch<00:03:58.489> black

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.630 

you

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.290 

so<00:04:08.640> to<00:04:09.210> get<00:04:09.540> the<00:04:09.690> kind<00:04:09.900> of<00:04:10.460> black<00:04:11.460> haze<00:04:11.850> I<00:04:12.060> want

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
so to get the kind of black haze I want

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.820 
so to get the kind of black haze I want
for<00:04:12.420> the<00:04:12.480> back<00:04:12.630> of<00:04:12.750> the<00:04:12.810> cave<00:04:13.020> i<00:04:13.260> use<00:04:13.440> a<00:04:13.470> really

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
for the back of the cave i use a really

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.680 
for the back of the cave i use a really

sure if I like how the world turned out

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.510

because<00:06:14.930> it<00:06:15.200> looks<00:06:15.410> pretty<00:06:15.560> dark<00:06:15.980> and<00:06:16.340> ominous

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
because it looks pretty dark and ominous

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.000

and<00:06:17.480> I<00:06:17.660> wanted<00:06:17.960> these<00:06:18.200> people<00:06:18.500> to<00:06:18.590> be<00:06:18.710> really

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.010 
and I wanted these people to be really

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.480

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:24.200 
don't really get that feeling from this

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.830 
don't really get that feeling from this
concept<00:06:24.710> so<00:06:25.340> it<00:06:26.030> might<00:06:26.240> be<00:06:26.330> something<00:06:26.540> I<00:06:26.720> end

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:26.840 
concept so it might be something I end
