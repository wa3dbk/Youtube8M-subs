00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
I'm gonna fit show you in slow mode then

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.580 
I'm gonna fit show you in slow mode then
medium<00:00:13.889> then<00:00:14.160> fast<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:14.759> then<00:00:15.320> just<00:00:16.320> say<00:00:16.440> what

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
medium then fast and then just say what

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.200 
medium then fast and then just say what
you<00:00:16.650> think<00:00:16.859> about<00:00:16.920> it<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.400> consider<00:00:17.880> it<00:00:18.060> for

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
you think about it and consider it for

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.880 
you think about it and consider it for
first<00:00:18.449> kill<00:00:18.660> it's<00:00:19.199> been<00:00:19.320> quite<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.529> while<00:00:19.710> on

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
first kill it's been quite a while on

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.210 
first kill it's been quite a while on
that<00:00:20.010> this<00:00:20.130> is<00:00:20.279> slow<00:00:20.550> mo<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:21.260> then<00:00:22.260> I<00:00:22.500> done

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
that this is slow mo and then I done

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.740 
that this is slow mo and then I done
some<00:00:23.430> mistakes<00:00:23.789> in<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.029> but<00:00:24.210> that's<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.720> whole

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
some mistakes in it but that's the whole

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.480 
some mistakes in it but that's the whole
point<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.289> learning<00:00:25.439> isn't<00:00:25.740> it<00:00:25.890> like<00:00:26.039> there<00:00:26.310> I

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
point of learning isn't it like there I

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.859 
point of learning isn't it like there I
did<00:00:26.730> it<00:00:26.849> mm<00:00:27.720> kind<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.369> I'll<00:00:29.369> step<00:00:29.670> twice<00:00:29.880> but

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
did it mm kind of I'll step twice but

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.830 
did it mm kind of I'll step twice but
yeah<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.710> then<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:31.920> goes<00:00:32.040> up<00:00:32.250> there<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.840> this

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
yeah and then it goes up there and this

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.299 
yeah and then it goes up there and this
week<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.170> apart<00:00:34.500> for<00:00:34.620> me<00:00:34.680> goes<00:00:34.829> too<00:00:35.010> much<00:00:35.160> on

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
week so I apart for me goes too much on

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.060 
week so I apart for me goes too much on
his<00:00:35.399> head<00:00:35.610> if<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.820> look<00:00:36.000> at<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:37.200> being<00:00:37.980> a

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
his head if you look at it and being a

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.650 
his head if you look at it and being a
free<00:00:38.250> one<00:00:38.399> on<00:00:38.430> myself<00:00:38.670> I'd<00:00:39.030> do<00:00:39.180> I'd<00:00:39.329> seen<00:00:39.510> their

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
free one on myself I'd do I'd seen their

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.100 
free one on myself I'd do I'd seen their
these<00:00:39.780> things<00:00:39.989> but<00:00:40.200> I'm<00:00:40.399> yeah<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:42.629> was<00:00:42.989> just

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
these things but I'm yeah and I was just

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.690 
these things but I'm yeah and I was just
gonna<00:00:43.260> get<00:00:43.890> on<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.280> then<00:00:44.430> got<00:00:44.550> the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
gonna get on to it and then got the

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.670 
gonna get on to it and then got the
ladder<00:00:44.879> there<00:00:45.210> but<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.480> just<00:00:45.960> said<00:00:46.200> justice<00:00:46.530> I

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
ladder there but I just said justice I

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.049 
ladder there but I just said justice I
just<00:00:46.860> flip<00:00:47.070> over<00:00:47.309> it<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.520> think<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:47.879> bits

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
just flip over it I think that bits

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.990 
just flip over it I think that bits
quite<00:00:48.270> cool<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:49.280> when<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.370> does<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.520> dash<00:00:50.760> over

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
quite cool and when it does a dash over

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.150 
quite cool and when it does a dash over
and<00:00:51.239> sends<00:00:51.870> into<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.110> backflip<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:52.829> really

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
and sends into a backflip this is really

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.939 
and sends into a backflip this is really
unrealistic<00:00:53.699> but<00:00:54.030> start<00:00:54.420> just<00:00:54.600> do<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.809> for<00:00:54.840> fun

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
unrealistic but start just do it for fun

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:57.470 
unrealistic but start just do it for fun
so<00:00:55.949> she<00:00:56.010> gives<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.460> nice<00:00:56.910> shakes<00:00:57.210> thing

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
so she gives it that nice shakes thing

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.110 
so she gives it that nice shakes thing
good<00:00:57.690> effects<00:00:57.960> their<00:00:58.520> kind<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.640> role<00:00:59.940> this

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
good effects their kind of a role this

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.150 
good effects their kind of a role this
is<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.390> really<00:01:00.960> good<00:01:01.050> effects<00:01:01.379> at<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.829> end<00:01:01.949> this

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
is a really good effects at the end this

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.880 
is a really good effects at the end this
bit<00:01:02.399> but<00:01:03.149> basically<00:01:03.510> just<00:01:03.870> like<00:01:03.960> making

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
bit but basically just like making

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.910 
bit but basically just like making
friends<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.339> then<00:01:06.140> the<00:01:07.140> other<00:01:07.439> guy<00:01:07.740> does<00:01:07.890> a

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
friends and then the other guy does a

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.380 
friends and then the other guy does a
backflip<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.640> what<00:01:08.790> can<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.030> do<00:01:09.180> and

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
backflip this is what can you do and

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.280 
backflip this is what can you do and
this<00:01:09.479> is<00:01:09.540> me<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.110> then

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
this is me and then

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.710 
this is me and then
the<00:01:11.350> double<00:01:12.190> front<00:01:12.400> flip<00:01:12.460> and<00:01:13.420> then<00:01:13.540> as<00:01:13.690> soon

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
the double front flip and then as soon

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.200 
the double front flip and then as soon
as<00:01:13.960> he<00:01:14.020> lands<00:01:14.320> he<00:01:14.980> pops<00:01:15.310> in<00:01:15.460> their<00:01:15.610> money<00:01:15.880> lands

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
as he lands he pops in their money lands

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.610 
as he lands he pops in their money lands
he<00:01:16.270> pops<00:01:16.480> him<00:01:16.600> in<00:01:16.720> the<00:01:16.810> eye<00:01:16.840> on<00:01:17.110> his<00:01:17.230> role<00:01:17.410> and

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.620 
he pops him in the eye on his role and

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.240 
he pops him in the eye on his role and
so<00:01:17.740> it's<00:01:17.950> pretty<00:01:18.070> cool<00:01:18.310> and<00:01:19.620> next<00:01:20.620> is<00:01:20.860> going<00:01:21.160> to

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
so it's pretty cool and next is going to

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.170 
so it's pretty cool and next is going to
be<00:01:21.400> medium<00:01:22.390> mode<00:01:22.570> this<00:01:23.500> is<00:01:23.650> media<00:01:23.890> mode<00:01:24.180> where

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
be medium mode this is media mode where

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.320 
be medium mode this is media mode where
am<00:01:25.540> I<00:01:26.010> had<00:01:27.010> to<00:01:27.130> change<00:01:27.310> pivot<00:01:27.760> because<00:01:28.090> the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
am I had to change pivot because the

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.530 
am I had to change pivot because the
bench<00:01:28.930> I<00:01:29.140> wanted<00:01:29.350> to<00:01:29.500> use<00:01:29.620> for<00:01:29.770> the<00:01:29.830> dashes<00:01:30.540> not

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
bench I wanted to use for the dashes not

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.200 
bench I wanted to use for the dashes not
um<00:01:31.810> it<00:01:32.470> wouldn't<00:01:32.800> come<00:01:32.979> on<00:01:33.130> this<00:01:33.370> pivot<00:01:33.729> so<00:01:33.970> am

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
um it wouldn't come on this pivot so am

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.130 
um it wouldn't come on this pivot so am
I<00:01:34.390> have<00:01:34.510> to<00:01:34.630> change<00:01:34.870> pivots<00:01:35.370> them<00:01:36.370> so<00:01:36.960> yeah<00:01:37.960> I

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
I have to change pivots them so yeah I

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.050 
I have to change pivots them so yeah I
was<00:01:38.440> gonna<00:01:38.530> from<00:01:39.100> now<00:01:39.250> just<00:01:39.550> connect<00:01:39.790> him<00:01:39.910> put

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
was gonna from now just connect him put

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.910 
was gonna from now just connect him put
a<00:01:40.090> lot<00:01:40.240> of<00:01:40.270> them<00:01:40.450> run<00:01:40.570> across<00:01:40.600> there<00:01:41.050> but<00:01:41.229> said

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
a lot of them run across there but said
