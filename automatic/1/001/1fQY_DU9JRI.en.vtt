we're creating a circle with our chest

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:10.070 
we're creating a circle with our chest

out in out in and then if we smooth it

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.520 
out in out in and then if we smooth it
out<00:01:37.700> we're<00:01:38.700> creating<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.270> circle<00:01:39.810> with<00:01:40.350> our

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
out we're creating a circle with our

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.859 
out we're creating a circle with our
chest<00:01:41.000> that<00:01:42.000> rolls<00:01:42.329> down<00:01:42.659> on<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.439> stomach<00:01:45.470> in

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
chest that rolls down on the stomach in

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:55.850 
chest that rolls down on the stomach in
in<00:01:52.880> in<00:01:53.880> when<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.540> become<00:01:54.840> comfortable<00:01:55.110> with

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
in in when you become comfortable with

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.760 
in in when you become comfortable with
the<00:01:56.100> movement<00:01:57.110> then<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.200> might<00:01:58.350> want<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.590> try

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
the movement then you might want to try

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:59.990 
the movement then you might want to try
walking<00:01:59.070> with<00:01:59.490> it

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
walking with it

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.790 
walking with it
because<00:02:00.300> you're<00:02:00.690> never<00:02:00.960> going<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.380> get<00:02:01.560> into

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
because you're never going to get into

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.940 
because you're never going to get into
the<00:02:01.920> habit<00:02:02.130> of<00:02:03.260> only<00:02:04.260> being<00:02:04.470> able<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.770> do

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
the habit of only being able to do

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.730 
the habit of only being able to do
movements<00:02:05.570> standing<00:02:06.570> still<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.110> not<00:02:07.260> walking

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
movements standing still and not walking

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.840 
movements standing still and not walking
so<00:02:09.500> you<00:02:10.500> might<00:02:10.710> want<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.009> coordinate<00:02:11.280> in<00:02:11.700> your

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
so you might want to coordinate in your

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.420 
so you might want to coordinate in your
head<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:13.020> you're<00:02:13.200> stepping<00:02:13.770> on<00:02:13.890> one<00:02:13.950> foot

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
head that you're stepping on one foot

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.430 
head that you're stepping on one foot
putting<00:02:14.940> all<00:02:15.180> of<00:02:15.210> your<00:02:15.510> weight<00:02:15.570> on<00:02:16.020> it

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
putting all of your weight on it

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.590 
putting all of your weight on it
and<00:02:16.530> then<00:02:16.980> setting<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.550> chest<00:02:17.820> forward<00:02:18.420> which

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
and then setting the chest forward which

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.840 
and then setting the chest forward which
is<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.900> first<00:02:19.170> part<00:02:19.410> of<00:02:19.530> our<00:02:19.620> in<00:02:19.800> relation<00:02:20.310> out

is the first part of our in relation out
up<00:02:21.360> out<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:22.620> then<00:02:23.459> take<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.880> next<00:02:24.090> step<00:02:24.450> in
