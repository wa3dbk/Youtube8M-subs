00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.270
 There has been a moment of confusion 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.980

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.770
 my goal was to reach fourth and then I 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.470
 the only thing he looked at in the time of 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:05.270
 Adrián Díaz and when Alberto says 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:07.010
 but and Carcha and I arrive fourth and now 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.630

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.220

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.040
 contracts with a fourth imagine with a 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.960

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.619

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.870

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.820
 mini kart quickly the child wishing 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.800
 I hope that I finally retire 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.360
 you intend to do some test 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.940
 more than the national 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.100
 madrid- the only thing we can run is 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.800
 The Madrid Community Rally Race 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.710
 closeness by we live although we are 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.830
 We live in Madrid for work 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:51.620
 we work in madrid and we can not run 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.020
 more the national unfortunately we are 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.460
 escapes from budget we have come here 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.290
 because it 's a rally that we love and 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.670
 because it's a rally that scores for the 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.750
 championship of castile and lion 'which is what 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.270
 What we do 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.490
 I would love to find a sponsor who 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.010
 will help us but it is impossible to 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.930
 run national so we will continue in the 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.780
 regional and in madrid we will return to 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.310
 see and happy to be able to follow 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.739
 running even one or two races 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.780
 of the national because it allows us to 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:21.230
 all strive and run with these people 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.120
 that said from the affection are a 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.120
 rabble who run from the first section 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.880
 to sack it is amazing how they go and you 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.060
 they apply at all brakings in 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.459
 all the curves to be able to win and 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.480
 this gives us a lot of life 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.100
 Well, my most sincere congratulations 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.110
 third place more than deserved to 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.190
 Enjoy it and celebrate it 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.190
 and thanks to you
