00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
like you do a job as sent a forward

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.970

because<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.149> can<00:00:57.360> see<00:00:57.390> 85<00:00:58.350> finishing<00:00:58.800> on<00:00:58.890> his

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
because I can see 85 finishing on his

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.279 
because I can see 85 finishing on his
card<00:00:59.190> which<00:00:59.370> isn't<00:00:59.760> actually<00:00:59.910> bad<00:01:00.719> at<00:01:00.989> all<00:01:01.020> for

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
card which isn't actually bad at all for

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.990 
card which isn't actually bad at all for
a<00:01:01.590> cam<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:01.890> think<00:01:02.070> 85<00:01:02.370> finishing<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.940> better

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
a cam I think 85 finishing is better

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.670 
a cam I think 85 finishing is better
than<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.420> lot<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.660> strikers<00:01:04.080> ice<00:01:04.199> pedal<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.530> do

very<00:01:14.040> accurate<00:01:14.909> there's<00:01:15.360> no<00:01:15.509> doubt<00:01:15.720> about

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
very accurate there's no doubt about

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.200 
very accurate there's no doubt about
that<00:01:16.080> but<00:01:16.320> they<00:01:16.650> do<00:01:16.710> lack<00:01:17.220> power<00:01:17.460> at<00:01:17.700> times<00:01:17.939> and

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
that but they do lack power at times and

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.060 
that but they do lack power at times and
very<00:01:18.290> accurate<00:01:19.290> but<00:01:19.380> as<00:01:19.439> I<00:01:19.530> said<00:01:19.680> do<00:01:19.890> like

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
very accurate but as I said do like

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.350 
very accurate but as I said do like
power<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:20.490> they're<00:01:20.610> doing<00:01:20.820> always<00:01:21.090> trouble

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
power so they're doing always trouble

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.330 
power so they're doing always trouble
keeper<00:01:21.630> which<00:01:22.049> can<00:01:22.350> be<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.590> bit<00:01:22.830> annoying<00:01:23.009> he's

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
keeper which can be a bit annoying he's

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.859 
keeper which can be a bit annoying he's
got<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.549> good<00:01:23.670> bit<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:23.850> strength<00:01:24.090> in<00:01:24.240> game<00:01:24.450> but

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
got a good bit of strength in game but

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.210 
got a good bit of strength in game but
his<00:01:24.990> balance<00:01:25.259> lets<00:01:25.439> him<00:01:25.590> down<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:25.950> seems<00:01:26.130> to

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
his balance lets him down that seems to

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.590 
his balance lets him down that seems to
be<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> common<00:01:26.490> thing<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.820> be<00:01:27.000> eyes<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.420> get<00:01:27.570> a
