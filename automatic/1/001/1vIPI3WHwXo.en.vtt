pretty much every day and I've shared
the<00:00:21.579> recipe<00:00:21.700> before<00:00:22.300> but<00:00:22.779> I<00:00:22.960> thought<00:00:23.140> it<00:00:23.259> would

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:23.349 
the recipe before but I thought it would

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:25.760 
the recipe before but I thought it would
be<00:00:23.439> fun<00:00:23.650> to<00:00:23.680> actually<00:00:24.130> show<00:00:24.460> you<00:00:24.489> how<00:00:24.610> I<00:00:24.730> do<00:00:24.849> it

be fun to actually show you how I do it

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.720 
be fun to actually show you how I do it
pretty<00:00:26.770> straightforward

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
pretty straightforward

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.490 
pretty straightforward
start<00:00:28.210> off<00:00:28.300> with<00:00:28.450> a<00:00:28.509> big<00:00:28.689> bowl<00:00:28.900> this<00:00:29.110> makes<00:00:29.349> a

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
start off with a big bowl this makes a

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.159 
start off with a big bowl this makes a
lot<00:00:29.710> of<00:00:29.739> measly<00:00:30.070> it's<00:00:30.910> it's<00:00:31.210> so<00:00:31.599> much<00:00:31.869> better

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
lot of measly it's it's so much better

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.729 
lot of measly it's it's so much better
than<00:00:32.860> the<00:00:33.660> usually<00:00:34.660> you<00:00:34.899> buy<00:00:34.930> premix<00:00:35.470> in<00:00:35.680> the

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
than the usually you buy premix in the

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:37.290 
than the usually you buy premix in the
shops<00:00:36.010> because<00:00:36.310> you<00:00:36.550> know<00:00:36.670> exactly<00:00:37.000> what's

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
shops because you know exactly what's

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.869 
shops because you know exactly what's
going<00:00:37.600> in<00:00:37.840> there<00:00:38.079> there's<00:00:38.649> not<00:00:38.949> any<00:00:39.250> added

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:39.879 
going in there there's not any added

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.259 
going in there there's not any added
sugar<00:00:40.620> salt<00:00:41.620> preservatives<00:00:42.460> additives<00:00:42.789> and

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:43.269 
sugar salt preservatives additives and

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:46.290 
sugar salt preservatives additives and
so<00:00:44.050> let's<00:00:44.679> get<00:00:44.829> started

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
so let's get started

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.349 
so let's get started
I<00:00:46.329> just<00:00:47.079> put<00:00:47.440> my<00:00:47.469> big<00:00:47.920> bowl<00:00:48.100> straight<00:00:49.030> onto<00:00:49.210> the

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:49.359 
I just put my big bowl straight onto the

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:52.139 
I just put my big bowl straight onto the
scales<00:00:49.920> makes<00:00:50.920> it<00:00:51.070> really<00:00:51.190> easy<00:00:51.309> to<00:00:51.609> add

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
scales makes it really easy to add

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:54.270 
scales makes it really easy to add
things<00:00:52.480> why<00:00:52.690> wait<00:00:52.899> let's<00:00:53.800> start<00:00:54.039> off<00:00:54.129> with

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
things why wait let's start off with

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.239 
things why wait let's start off with
quotes<00:00:54.629> now<00:00:55.629> these<00:00:56.019> are<00:00:56.199> unstabilized<00:00:56.980> right

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:57.249 
quotes now these are unstabilized right

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:00.270 
quotes now these are unstabilized right
and<00:00:57.820> we're<00:00:57.910> going<00:00:57.999> to<00:00:58.089> add<00:00:58.210> about<00:00:59.010> 750<00:01:00.010> grams

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
and we're going to add about 750 grams

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:07.890 
and we're going to add about 750 grams
of<00:01:00.850> oats<00:01:01.210> into<00:01:01.539> my<00:01:01.660> bowl<00:01:06.390> now<00:01:07.390> the<00:01:07.450> reason<00:01:07.840> I

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
of oats into my bowl now the reason I

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.080 
of oats into my bowl now the reason I
use<00:01:08.080> unstabilized<00:01:08.980> oats<00:01:09.310> is<00:01:09.610> they<00:01:09.820> haven't

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
use unstabilized oats is they haven't

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.130 
use unstabilized oats is they haven't
been<00:01:10.360> heat-treated

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
been heat-treated

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.260 
been heat-treated
the<00:01:11.980> rolled<00:01:12.370> oats<00:01:12.610> that<00:01:12.790> you<00:01:12.940> buy<00:01:13.090> in<00:01:13.240> the

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
the rolled oats that you buy in the

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.460 
the rolled oats that you buy in the
supermarket<00:01:13.510> they've<00:01:14.080> been<00:01:14.230> heat<00:01:14.440> treated

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
supermarket they've been heat treated

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.280 
supermarket they've been heat treated
and<00:01:15.100> the<00:01:15.670> heat<00:01:15.850> treatment<00:01:16.060> is<00:01:16.390> to<00:01:16.600> preserve

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
and the heat treatment is to preserve

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.500 
and the heat treatment is to preserve
their<00:01:17.530> shelf<00:01:17.770> life<00:01:17.980> and<00:01:18.190> what<00:01:18.850> that<00:01:19.060> means<00:01:19.210> is

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
their shelf life and what that means is

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.330 
their shelf life and what that means is
when<00:01:19.660> you<00:01:19.780> eat<00:01:19.930> them<00:01:20.170> it's<00:01:20.440> a<00:01:20.560> lot<00:01:20.710> harder<00:01:20.950> for

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
when you eat them it's a lot harder for

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.460 
when you eat them it's a lot harder for
your<00:01:21.820> digestive<00:01:22.570> system<00:01:22.630> to<00:01:22.990> break<00:01:23.260> them<00:01:23.440> down

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
your digestive system to break them down

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.100 
your digestive system to break them down
so<00:01:24.220> you're<00:01:24.370> fine<00:01:24.610> by<00:01:24.850> just<00:01:25.330> making<00:01:25.750> the<00:01:25.870> switch

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
so you're fine by just making the switch

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.640 
so you're fine by just making the switch
from<00:01:27.000> regular<00:01:28.000> old<00:01:28.210> oats<00:01:28.420> to<00:01:28.690> unstabilized<00:01:29.380> or

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
from regular old oats to unstabilized or

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.490 
from regular old oats to unstabilized or
steel<00:01:29.950> cut<00:01:30.160> oats<00:01:30.370> that<00:01:31.330> these<00:01:32.020> are<00:01:32.230> a<00:01:32.260> lot

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
steel cut oats that these are a lot

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.470 
steel cut oats that these are a lot
easier<00:01:32.710> on<00:01:33.160> your<00:01:33.340> digestive<00:01:33.370> system<00:01:35.940> now<00:01:36.940> next

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 
easier on your digestive system now next

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.050 
easier on your digestive system now next
to<00:01:37.570> add<00:01:37.720> some<00:01:38.080> rice<00:01:38.320> bran<00:01:38.650> flakes<00:01:39.040> I've<00:01:39.850> got

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
to add some rice bran flakes I've got

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.390 
to add some rice bran flakes I've got
three<00:01:40.570> cups<00:01:40.720> of<00:01:40.990> these<00:01:41.170> and<00:01:41.680> they<00:01:42.070> just<00:01:42.250> go

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
three cups of these and they just go

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.440 
three cups of these and they just go
straight<00:01:42.730> in

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
straight in

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.810 
straight in
I<00:01:43.540> get<00:01:43.900> the<00:01:44.020> rice<00:01:44.200> bran<00:01:44.440> flakes<00:01:44.830> from<00:01:45.250> a<00:01:45.550> bulk

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
I get the rice bran flakes from a bulk

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.080 
I get the rice bran flakes from a bulk
whole<00:01:46.120> food<00:01:46.420> store<00:01:47.160> but<00:01:48.160> I<00:01:48.340> put<00:01:48.610> them<00:01:48.760> in<00:01:48.910> there

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
whole food store but I put them in there

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.790 
whole food store but I put them in there
to<00:01:49.180> add<00:01:49.300> a<00:01:49.330> bit<00:01:49.510> of<00:01:49.570> lightness<00:01:50.020> and<00:01:50.200> crunch<00:01:50.440> to

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
to add a bit of lightness and crunch to

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.130 
to add a bit of lightness and crunch to
them<00:01:50.890> easily<00:01:51.150> the<00:01:52.150> kids<00:01:52.360> love<00:01:52.540> the<00:01:52.690> texture

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
them easily the kids love the texture

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.590 
them easily the kids love the texture
and<00:01:53.350> so<00:01:53.800> it<00:01:54.100> I<00:01:54.550> guess<00:01:54.790> makes<00:01:55.000> it<00:01:55.150> that<00:01:55.300> bit

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
and so it I guess makes it that bit

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.640 
and so it I guess makes it that bit
lighter<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:57.340> I<00:01:58.270> guess<00:01:58.600> if<00:01:59.080> you<00:01:59.200> can't<00:01:59.380> find

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
lighter and I guess if you can't find

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.650 
lighter and I guess if you can't find
the<00:01:59.770> right<00:01:59.920> plan<00:02:00.220> bran<00:02:00.730> flakes<00:02:01.060> you<00:02:01.270> could<00:02:01.450> try

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
the right plan bran flakes you could try

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.960 
the right plan bran flakes you could try
right<00:02:02.320> flakes<00:02:02.710> or<00:02:03.100> even<00:02:03.520> a<00:02:03.790> corn<00:02:04.270> flake

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
right flakes or even a corn flake

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.520 
right flakes or even a corn flake
whatever<00:02:06.970> you<00:02:07.150> like<00:02:07.330> to<00:02:07.690> give<00:02:07.990> it<00:02:08.019> that<00:02:08.110> a<00:02:08.259> bit

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
whatever you like to give it that a bit
