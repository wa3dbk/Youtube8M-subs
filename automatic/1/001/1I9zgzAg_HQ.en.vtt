what<00:01:25.740> happened<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.040> thought<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.250> was<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.369> bit<00:01:26.490> of

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
what happened I thought it was a bit of

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.070 
what happened I thought it was a bit of
a<00:01:26.640> soccer<00:01:26.820> player<00:01:27.060> thought<00:01:27.299> we<00:01:27.390> were<00:01:27.509> better

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
a soccer player thought we were better

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.990 
a soccer player thought we were better
at<00:01:28.170> saying<00:01:28.320> what<00:01:28.470> we<00:01:28.560> said<00:01:28.740> but<00:01:29.000> very

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
at saying what we said but very

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.359 
at saying what we said but very
disappointing<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.630> hard<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.110> take<00:01:31.290> Nico<00:01:32.159> as

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
disappointing and hard to take Nico as

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.370 
disappointing and hard to take Nico as
an<00:01:32.579> opponent<00:01:32.880> equally<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.960> Peter<00:01:34.170> was

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
an opponent equally the Peter was

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.569 
an opponent equally the Peter was
involved<00:01:34.740> in<00:01:34.829> both<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.130> goals<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.490> his

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
involved in both the goals and his

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.280 
involved in both the goals and his
finish<00:01:35.880> for<00:01:36.030> their<00:01:36.180> second<00:01:37.110> goal<00:01:37.229> was

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
finish for their second goal was

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.700 
finish for their second goal was
terrific

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
terrific

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.280 
terrific
like<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.130> said<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.369> was<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.490> fantastic<00:01:38.820> take<00:01:39.290> I

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
like I said it was a fantastic take I

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.590 
like I said it was a fantastic take I
think<00:01:40.710> he<00:01:40.799> was<00:01:40.920> great<00:01:41.040> today<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:42.540> think

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
think he was great today and I think

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.120 
think he was great today and I think
with<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.290> home<00:01:43.470> team<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:43.770> off<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.040> gonna

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
with the home team is off is gonna

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.069 
with the home team is off is gonna
complain<00:01:44.520> him<00:01:44.759> using<00:01:45.030> his<00:01:45.060> hands<00:01:45.509> or<00:01:45.600> not<00:01:45.780> but

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
complain him using his hands or not but

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.200 
complain him using his hands or not but
you<00:01:46.799> know<00:01:46.979> what<00:01:47.159> he<00:01:47.340> he<00:01:47.759> brings<00:01:47.970> through<00:01:48.119> the

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
you know what he he brings through the

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.550 
you know what he he brings through the
team<00:01:48.390> he<00:01:48.540> holds<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.840> ball<00:01:48.960> probably<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.409> best

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
team he holds the ball probably the best

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.030 
team he holds the ball probably the best
in<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:50.159> league<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:51.290> we<00:01:52.290> we<00:01:52.590> had<00:01:52.710> problems

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
in this league and we we had problems

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.550 
in this league and we we had problems
coping<00:01:53.189> with<00:01:53.490> him<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.850> obviously<00:01:54.439> it<00:01:55.439> was

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
coping with him and obviously it was

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.660 
coping with him and obviously it was
difficult<00:01:55.740> for<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.100> lads<00:01:56.280> at<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.490> back

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
difficult for the lads at the back

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.670 
difficult for the lads at the back
because<00:01:56.850> every<00:01:57.210> long<00:01:57.360> ball<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.780> threat<00:01:58.020> do

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
because every long ball is a threat do

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.660 
because every long ball is a threat do
you<00:01:58.770> feel<00:01:58.950> you're<00:01:59.130> all<00:01:59.219> getting<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.549> know<00:01:59.640> each

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
you feel you're all getting to know each

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.069 
you feel you're all getting to know each
other<00:01:59.909> that<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.149> feel<00:02:00.329> progress<00:02:00.750> is<00:02:00.869> being

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
other that you feel progress is being

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.690 
other that you feel progress is being
made<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.530> you're<00:02:01.710> going<00:02:01.890> forward<00:02:02.130> well<00:02:02.640> I

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
made and you're going forward well I

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.429 
made and you're going forward well I
think<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.060> think<00:02:03.119> what<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:03.689> said<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:03.990> do<00:02:04.110> will

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
think so I think what I said to do will

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.440 
think so I think what I said to do will
show<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.619> character<00:02:05.369> from<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.149> footballing

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
show the character from the footballing

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.819 
show the character from the footballing
side<00:02:06.689> I<00:02:06.719> think<00:02:06.930> we<00:02:07.049> have<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.290> improve<00:02:07.560> very

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
side I think we have to improve very

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:08.359 
side I think we have to improve very
much

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
much

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.520 
much
but<00:02:09.149> we<00:02:09.299> showed<00:02:09.479> spirit<00:02:09.840> character<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.440> I

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
but we showed spirit character and I

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.160 
but we showed spirit character and I
think<00:02:10.709> that<00:02:10.830> is<00:02:10.950> very<00:02:11.099> important<00:02:11.580> but

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
think that is very important but

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.940 
think that is very important but
throughout<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.319> game<00:02:13.470> I<00:02:13.590> think<00:02:13.769> there's<00:02:13.920> a

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
throughout the game I think there's a

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.830 
throughout the game I think there's a
lot<00:02:14.069> of<00:02:14.129> things<00:02:14.310> that<00:02:14.459> can<00:02:14.670> improve<00:02:14.840> and

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
lot of things that can improve and

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.660 
lot of things that can improve and
what's<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.379> assessment<00:02:17.250> from<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.459> stokke

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
what's the assessment from the stokke

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.800 
what's the assessment from the stokke
position<00:02:18.000> by<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.150> way<00:02:18.360> they<00:02:18.510> thought<00:02:18.659> you<00:02:18.780> a

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
position by the way they thought you a

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.119 
position by the way they thought you a
crime<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.230> climbing<00:02:19.470> all<00:02:19.560> over<00:02:19.590> Rio<00:02:19.890> for<00:02:20.069> the

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
crime and climbing all over Rio for the

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:21.680 
crime and climbing all over Rio for the
first<00:02:20.370> goal<00:02:20.580> but<00:02:20.760> there<00:02:20.909> was<00:02:21.360> good<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.569> say

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
first goal but there was good to say

from home we need to get back to basics

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.490 
from home we need to get back to basics
at<00:02:29.159> home<00:02:29.310> we've<00:02:29.640> lost<00:02:29.819> a<00:02:29.940> couple<00:02:29.970> of

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
at home we've lost a couple of

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.180 
at home we've lost a couple of
disappointing<00:02:31.500> games<00:02:31.620> at<00:02:31.739> home<00:02:31.860> away<00:02:32.159> from

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
disappointing games at home away from

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.830 
disappointing games at home away from
home<00:02:32.459> you<00:02:32.489> look<00:02:32.640> like<00:02:32.790> a<00:02:32.819> real<00:02:33.060> threat<00:02:33.329> I<00:02:33.659> think

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
home you look like a real threat I think

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.229 
home you look like a real threat I think
the<00:02:33.900> counter-attack<00:02:34.260> today<00:02:35.190> you<00:02:36.090> know<00:02:36.180> I've

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
the counter-attack today you know I've

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.020 
the counter-attack today you know I've
got<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:36.420> lot<00:02:36.569> more<00:02:36.599> pace<00:02:37.549> you<00:02:38.549> know<00:02:38.579> we're

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
got a lot more pace you know we're

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.460 
got a lot more pace you know we're
always<00:02:39.239> a<00:02:39.269> threat<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:39.659> I<00:02:39.720> thought<00:02:39.870> we<00:02:40.319> could

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
always a threat and I thought we could

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.660 
always a threat and I thought we could
have<00:02:40.560> scored<00:02:40.799> you<00:02:40.890> know<00:02:40.980> maybe<00:02:41.250> three<00:02:41.489> or<00:02:41.579> four

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
have scored you know maybe three or four

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.940 
have scored you know maybe three or four
but<00:02:42.060> say<00:02:42.690> if<00:02:42.780> you<00:02:42.840> don't<00:02:43.019> if<00:02:43.470> you<00:02:43.590> don't<00:02:43.769> punish

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
but say if you don't if you don't punish

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.199 
but say if you don't if you don't punish
the<00:02:44.190> teams<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:44.579> obviously<00:02:44.910> you've<00:02:45.030> got<00:02:45.150> the

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
the teams and obviously you've got the
