this fruit of years has been is tried
and<00:00:35.760> tested<00:00:36.380> slow<00:00:37.380> cooker<00:00:37.800> we've<00:00:38.219> had<00:00:38.340> this

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
and tested slow cooker we've had this

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.580 
and tested slow cooker we've had this
thing<00:00:38.850> must<00:00:39.360> be<00:00:39.510> getting<00:00:39.809> on<00:00:39.899> for<00:00:40.079> 30<00:00:40.290> years

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
thing must be getting on for 30 years

it's very slow low heat and quite safe

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.090 
it's very slow low heat and quite safe
and<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.570> one<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.930> real<00:01:13.140> benefits<00:01:13.619> about<00:01:13.920> it

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
and the one the real benefits about it

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.880 
and the one the real benefits about it
is<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.939> uses<00:01:15.180> very<00:01:15.570> little<00:01:15.659> energy<00:01:16.020> so

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
is that it uses very little energy so

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.890 
is that it uses very little energy so
this<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.369> another<00:01:17.580> good<00:01:17.820> thing<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.090> save<00:01:18.570> on

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
this is another good thing to save on

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.950 
this is another good thing to save on
your<00:01:18.960> energy<00:01:19.170> bill<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.509> this<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.720> thing

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
your energy bill so this is the thing

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.109 
your energy bill so this is the thing
we're<00:01:22.140> going<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.320> do<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:23.100> James<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:23.580> think<00:01:23.970> is
