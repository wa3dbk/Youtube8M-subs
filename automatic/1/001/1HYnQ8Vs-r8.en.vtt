00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
really easily so you know that's kind of

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.520 
really easily so you know that's kind of
a<00:01:51.060> cool<00:01:51.210> way<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.479> can<00:01:51.750> really<00:01:51.960> adjust<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.380> to

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
a cool way you can really adjust it to

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.920 
a cool way you can really adjust it to
how<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.710> want<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.369> Machine<00:01:53.670> set<00:01:53.939> up<00:01:54.149> it

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
how you want the Machine set up it

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.960 
how you want the Machine set up it
really<00:01:55.110> lends<00:01:55.380> itself<00:01:55.500> out<00:01:55.890> both<00:01:56.100> ways<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:56.640> now

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
really lends itself out both ways so now

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.310 
really lends itself out both ways so now
let's<00:01:57.149> look<00:01:57.210> at<00:01:57.420> inside<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.049> cab<00:01:58.229> because

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
let's look at inside the cab because

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.690 
let's look at inside the cab because
there's<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.680> lot<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:58.979> cool<00:01:59.100> features<00:01:59.280> in<00:01:59.670> here

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
there's a lot of cool features in here

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
every little compartment on this if they

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.160 
every little compartment on this if they
thought<00:02:20.310> they<00:02:20.519> could<00:02:20.670> use<00:02:20.700> they<00:02:21.060> did<00:02:21.360> now<00:02:22.019> they

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
also put this thing with an electronic

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.000 
also put this thing with an electronic
four-wheel<00:02:24.900> drive<00:02:25.079> so<00:02:25.290> it's<00:02:25.410> very<00:02:25.590> easy<00:02:25.859> to

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
four-wheel drive so it's very easy to

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.860 
four-wheel drive so it's very easy to
just<00:02:26.370> turn<00:02:26.549> the<00:02:26.609> knob<00:02:26.760> from<00:02:27.329> two-wheel<00:02:27.660> drive

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
just turn the knob from two-wheel drive

just turn the knob from two-wheel drive
to<00:02:28.049> four-wheel<00:02:28.260> drive<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.709> locked<00:02:28.950> in<00:02:29.220> but

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
to four-wheel drive to locked in but

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.620 
to four-wheel drive to locked in but
what<00:02:29.820> really<00:02:30.060> makes<00:02:30.299> this<00:02:30.450> machine

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
what really makes this machine

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.050 
what really makes this machine
interesting<00:02:31.530> is<00:02:31.890> that<00:02:31.950> even<00:02:32.370> with<00:02:32.459> a<00:02:32.489> roof<00:02:32.790> on

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
interesting is that even with a roof on

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.750 
interesting is that even with a roof on
it<00:02:33.090> it<00:02:33.359> comes<00:02:33.600> in<00:02:33.720> at<00:02:33.840> 13<00:02:34.290> -<00:02:34.560> so<00:02:34.829> that's<00:02:35.220> a<00:02:35.370> great

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
it it comes in at 13 - so that's a great

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.180 
it it comes in at 13 - so that's a great
value<00:02:36.299> but<00:02:36.900> there's<00:02:37.080> lots<00:02:37.440> options<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:38.010> talk
