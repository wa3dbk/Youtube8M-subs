carrying a bit of excess but other than

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.970 
carrying a bit of excess but other than
that<00:03:35.400> no<00:03:36.239> it's<00:03:36.569> good<00:03:36.900> and<00:03:37.139> it's<00:03:37.380> said<00:03:37.829> it's

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
that no it's good and it's said it's

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.250 
that no it's good and it's said it's
practical<00:03:38.459> there's<00:03:38.940> a<00:03:39.000> good<00:03:39.150> sized<00:03:39.359> boot<00:03:39.690> the

rear seat folds absolutely flat which is

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.420 
rear seat folds absolutely flat which is
fine<00:03:42.959> I<00:03:43.230> think<00:03:43.560> it's<00:03:43.829> a<00:03:43.859> wonderful<00:03:43.980> looking

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
fine I think it's a wonderful looking

car<00:03:44.669> it's<00:03:45.180> so<00:03:45.419> as<00:03:45.959> I<00:03:46.079> said<00:03:46.260> to<00:03:46.349> somebody

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
car it's so as I said to somebody

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.059 
car it's so as I said to somebody
earlier<00:03:46.680> it's<00:03:47.549> quite<00:03:47.880> difficult<00:03:48.209> to<00:03:49.069> style

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
earlier it's quite difficult to style

the<00:03:50.400> rear<00:03:50.700> of<00:03:50.910> a<00:03:51.000> coupe<00:03:51.239> a<00:03:51.419> so<00:03:51.900> it<00:03:52.049> doesn't<00:03:52.349> look

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
the rear of a coupe a so it doesn't look

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:54.680 
the rear of a coupe a so it doesn't look
largely<00:03:53.579> for<00:03:53.819> what<00:03:53.940> a<00:03:53.970> bit<00:03:54.180> of<00:03:54.239> a<00:03:54.269> better<00:03:54.419> word

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
largely for what a bit of a better word

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.589 
largely for what a bit of a better word
and<00:03:55.019> I<00:03:55.290> think<00:03:55.500> they've<00:03:55.590> achieved<00:03:55.709> it<00:03:56.099> here

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599
