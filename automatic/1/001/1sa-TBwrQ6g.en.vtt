00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.939 

one<00:00:18.720> of<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.869> cool<00:00:19.109> things<00:00:19.140> about<00:00:19.500> creating

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
one of the cool things about creating

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.070 
one of the cool things about creating
your<00:00:20.220> own<00:00:20.279> responsive<00:00:21.060> presentation<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:21.990> that

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
your own responsive presentation is that

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.650 
your own responsive presentation is that
not<00:00:22.590> only<00:00:22.740> can<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.160> take<00:00:23.820> advantage<00:00:24.150> of

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
not only can you take advantage of

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.570 
not only can you take advantage of
things<00:00:24.990> that<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.320> user<00:00:25.500> already<00:00:25.800> expects

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
things that the user already expects

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.670 
things that the user already expects
like<00:00:26.970> using<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.420> arrow<00:00:27.599> keys<00:00:28.050> that<00:00:28.470> they

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
like using the arrow keys that they

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.750 
like using the arrow keys that they
would<00:00:28.800> find<00:00:29.010> in<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.220> PowerPoint<00:00:29.699> presentation

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
would find in a PowerPoint presentation

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.780 
would find in a PowerPoint presentation
but<00:00:30.750> scaling<00:00:31.050> down<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.500> devices<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.399> can<00:00:32.579> take

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
but scaling down to devices you can take

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.060 
but scaling down to devices you can take
advantage<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:33.420> other<00:00:33.690> expectations<00:00:34.230> like

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
advantage of other expectations like

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.610 
advantage of other expectations like
swipe<00:00:35.430> gestures<00:00:35.910> so<00:00:36.540> let's<00:00:37.050> go<00:00:37.170> ahead<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.350> add

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
swipe gestures so let's go ahead and add

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.100 
swipe gestures so let's go ahead and add
a<00:00:37.649> swipe<00:00:38.040> library<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.850> wire<00:00:39.510> up<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.840> swipe

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
a swipe library and wire up the swipe

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.170 
a swipe library and wire up the swipe
gestures<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.219> navigation<00:00:41.820> we<00:00:41.940> already

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
gestures to the navigation we already

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.990 
gestures to the navigation we already
have<00:00:42.360> so<00:00:43.140> let's<00:00:43.260> start<00:00:43.530> by<00:00:43.710> going<00:00:43.739> into<00:00:44.370> the

that library is incorporated in our

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.100 
that library is incorporated in our
project<00:01:03.149> there's<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.809> couple<00:01:04.019> different

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
project there's a couple different

project there's a couple different
libraries<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.920> can<00:01:04.949> use<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.489> one<00:01:05.610> we're

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760

libraries you can use the one we're
going<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.909> use<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.840> case<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.439> touch<00:01:08.280> wipe

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
going to use in this case is touch wipe

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.429 
going to use in this case is touch wipe
if<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:09.000> don't<00:01:09.150> have<00:01:09.270> access<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.229> exercise

if you don't have access to the exercise
files<00:01:10.799> just<00:01:11.640> do<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.790> search<00:01:12.060> for<00:01:12.360> jQuery<00:01:12.900> and

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
files just do a search for jQuery and

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.429 
files just do a search for jQuery and
then<00:01:13.650> touch<00:01:14.040> wipe<00:01:14.340> on<00:01:14.549> one<00:01:14.970> word<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.450> we<00:01:16.259> want

then touch wipe on one word and we want

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.760 
then touch wipe on one word and we want
this<00:01:16.619> minimize<00:01:17.280> this<00:01:17.670> minified<00:01:18.240> file<00:01:18.630> if<00:01:18.900> you

this<00:02:16.470> code<00:02:16.739> is<00:02:17.010> kind<00:02:17.310> of<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.430> long<00:02:17.640> chunk<00:02:18.030> and

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
this code is kind of a long chunk and

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.390 
this code is kind of a long chunk and
it's<00:02:18.599> a<00:02:18.690> little<00:02:18.930> bit<00:02:19.050> complicated<00:02:19.410> so<00:02:20.010> if

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
it's a little bit complicated so if

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.160 
it's a little bit complicated so if
you're<00:02:21.000> worried<00:02:21.209> about<00:02:21.270> making<00:02:21.480> mistakes<00:02:21.959> or

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
you're worried about making mistakes or

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.809 
you're worried about making mistakes or
you'd<00:02:22.260> rather<00:02:22.410> just<00:02:22.709> copy<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.160> paste<00:02:23.400> it<00:02:23.580> you

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
you'd rather just copy and paste it you

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.880 
you'd rather just copy and paste it you
can<00:02:24.180> grab<00:02:24.360> it<00:02:24.390> from<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.780> snippets<00:02:25.410> file<00:02:25.650> in

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
can grab it from the snippets file in

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.059 
can grab it from the snippets file in
this<00:02:26.550> videos<00:02:26.880> exercise<00:02:27.599> folder<00:02:27.890> so<00:02:28.890> let's

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
this videos exercise folder so let's

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.120 
this videos exercise folder so let's
call<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.580> jQuery<00:02:30.030> function<00:02:30.510> again<00:02:30.900> this<00:02:31.800> time

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
call the jQuery function again this time

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.190 
call the jQuery function again this time
we're<00:02:32.370> going<00:02:32.550> to<00:02:32.700> look<00:02:33.510> for<00:02:33.720> that<00:02:33.810> slides

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
we're going to look for that slides

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.080 
we're going to look for that slides
container<00:02:34.739> so<00:02:35.099> we<00:02:35.130> want<00:02:35.370> to<00:02:35.459> detect<00:02:35.790> any

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
container so we want to detect any

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.960 
container so we want to detect any
swipes<00:02:36.510> that<00:02:36.840> happen<00:02:37.230> on<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:38.220> container<00:02:38.790> that

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
swipes that happen on the container that

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.770 
swipes that happen on the container that
holds<00:02:39.120> all<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.450> slides<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:41.239> the<00:02:42.239> syntax<00:02:42.660> for

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
holds all the slides and the syntax for

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.720 
holds all the slides and the syntax for
this<00:02:42.989> is<00:02:43.200> that<00:02:43.230> we<00:02:43.530> then<00:02:43.680> call<00:02:43.980> this<00:02:44.160> swipe

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
this is that we then call this swipe

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.720 
this is that we then call this swipe
function<00:02:45.269> and<00:02:45.620> then<00:02:46.620> we<00:02:46.799> pass<00:02:47.280> in<00:02:47.549> the

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
function and then we pass in the

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:48.830 
function and then we pass in the
parameters<00:02:48.180> that<00:02:48.269> we're<00:02:48.420> gonna<00:02:48.510> use

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
parameters that we're gonna use

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.289 
parameters that we're gonna use
so<00:02:49.590> this<00:02:49.739> touch<00:02:50.010> swipe<00:02:50.280> library<00:02:50.819> is<00:02:51.030> rather

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
so this touch swipe library is rather

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.120 
so this touch swipe library is rather
advanced<00:02:51.750> there's<00:02:52.110> a<00:02:52.170> lot<00:02:52.319> of<00:02:52.440> features<00:02:52.620> in<00:02:53.010> it

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
advanced there's a lot of features in it

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.800 
advanced there's a lot of features in it
that<00:02:53.310> you<00:02:53.430> may<00:02:53.580> want<00:02:53.850> to<00:02:53.910> play<00:02:54.209> with<00:02:54.390> on<00:02:54.630> your

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
that you may want to play with on your

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.630 
that you may want to play with on your
own<00:02:54.870> but<00:02:55.530> for<00:02:55.680> right<00:02:55.860> now<00:02:55.890> we're<00:02:56.370> just<00:02:56.400> gonna

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
own but for right now we're just gonna

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.150 
own but for right now we're just gonna
do<00:02:56.880> a<00:02:56.910> real<00:02:57.150> simple<00:02:57.480> implementation<00:02:58.440> it's

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
do a real simple implementation it's

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.620 
do a real simple implementation it's
going<00:02:59.340> to<00:02:59.400> open<00:02:59.549> up<00:02:59.760> this<00:02:59.970> object<00:03:00.239> with<00:03:00.599> a

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
going to open up this object with a

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.620 
going to open up this object with a
curly<00:03:00.959> bracket<00:03:01.170> and<00:03:01.640> for<00:03:02.640> this<00:03:02.760> swipe

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
curly bracket and for this swipe

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.400 
curly bracket and for this swipe
property<00:03:04.260> it's<00:03:04.680> gonna<00:03:04.799> be<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:04.980> function<00:03:05.519> and

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
property it's gonna be a function and

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.720 
property it's gonna be a function and
we're<00:03:07.410> gonna<00:03:07.500> type<00:03:07.950> out<00:03:08.099> all<00:03:08.310> of<00:03:08.370> the

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
we're gonna type out all of the

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.910 
we're gonna type out all of the
parameters<00:03:09.630> from<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.049> documentation<00:03:10.890> but

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
parameters from the documentation but

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.920 
parameters from the documentation but
we're<00:03:11.130> only<00:03:11.190> gonna<00:03:11.340> use<00:03:11.580> one<00:03:11.849> of<00:03:11.880> them<00:03:12.090> for

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
we're only gonna use one of them for

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.690 
we're only gonna use one of them for
right<00:03:13.080> now<00:03:13.260> you<00:03:13.830> can<00:03:13.980> of<00:03:14.069> course<00:03:14.130> take

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
right now you can of course take

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.979 
right now you can of course take
advantage<00:03:15.090> of<00:03:15.239> more<00:03:15.480> of<00:03:15.599> them<00:03:15.720> on<00:03:15.810> your<00:03:15.959> own

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
advantage of more of them on your own

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.420 
advantage of more of them on your own
first<00:03:16.440> one's<00:03:16.709> event<00:03:17.069> and<00:03:17.310> then<00:03:18.180> Direction

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
first one's event and then Direction

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.710 
first one's event and then Direction
distance<00:03:20.430> these<00:03:20.940> are<00:03:21.060> all<00:03:21.180> separated<00:03:21.630> by

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
distance these are all separated by

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.530 
distance these are all separated by
commas<00:03:22.290> and<00:03:22.829> duration<00:03:23.790> and<00:03:24.410> finger<00:03:25.410> count<00:03:25.680> and

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
commas and duration and finger count and

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.210 
commas and duration and finger count and
then<00:03:27.540> we're<00:03:27.690> gonna<00:03:27.780> close<00:03:28.320> that<00:03:28.440> parenthesis

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
then we're gonna close that parenthesis

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.270 
then we're gonna close that parenthesis
and<00:03:29.450> open<00:03:30.450> a<00:03:30.510> curly<00:03:30.810> bracket<00:03:31.290> and<00:03:31.440> I'm<00:03:32.130> just

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
and open a curly bracket and I'm just

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.580 
and open a curly bracket and I'm just
gonna<00:03:32.400> hit<00:03:32.609> another<00:03:33.030> line<00:03:33.269> to<00:03:33.750> return<00:03:33.900> close

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
gonna hit another line to return close

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.349 
gonna hit another line to return close
the<00:03:34.799> curly<00:03:34.980> bracket<00:03:35.130> and<00:03:35.700> I'm<00:03:35.940> going<00:03:36.060> to<00:03:36.120> close

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
the curly bracket and I'm going to close

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:40.009 
the curly bracket and I'm going to close
the<00:03:36.780> other<00:03:36.870> curly<00:03:37.260> bracket<00:03:37.680> and<00:03:38.269> also<00:03:39.269> close

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
the other curly bracket and also close

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.559 
the other curly bracket and also close
this<00:03:40.290> parenthesis<00:03:41.069> here<00:03:41.340> and<00:03:41.519> end<00:03:42.269> the<00:03:42.389> line

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
this parenthesis here and end the line

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.319 
this parenthesis here and end the line
with<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:42.840> semicolon<00:03:43.609> so<00:03:44.609> here<00:03:44.850> we<00:03:45.000> want<00:03:45.120> to

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
with the semicolon so here we want to

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.930 
with the semicolon so here we want to
detect<00:03:45.630> for<00:03:45.959> what<00:03:46.319> direction<00:03:46.829> that<00:03:47.160> the<00:03:47.370> user

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
detect for what direction that the user

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.330 
detect for what direction that the user
is<00:03:48.180> swiped<00:03:48.480> so<00:03:48.930> we're<00:03:49.049> going<00:03:49.139> to<00:03:49.200> add<00:03:49.440> a<00:03:49.739> switch

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
is swiped so we're going to add a switch

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.120 
is swiped so we're going to add a switch
statement<00:03:50.519> and<00:03:51.000> again<00:03:51.900> you<00:03:52.260> could<00:03:52.410> use<00:03:52.859> if

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
statement and again you could use if

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.879 
statement and again you could use if
else<00:03:53.340> if<00:03:53.579> you<00:03:53.670> prefer<00:03:54.000> with<00:03:54.209> this<00:03:54.650> it's<00:03:55.650> really

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
else if you prefer with this it's really

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:00.590 
else if you prefer with this it's really
up<00:03:56.010> to<00:03:56.160> you<00:03:57.530> so<00:03:58.530> we<00:03:58.769> want<00:03:58.980> to<00:03:59.250> switch<00:03:59.850> on<00:04:00.209> that

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
up to you so we want to switch on that

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.500 
up to you so we want to switch on that
direction<00:04:01.100> we're<00:04:02.100> gonna<00:04:02.190> add<00:04:02.430> two<00:04:02.790> cases<00:04:03.269> you

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
direction we're gonna add two cases you

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.440 
direction we're gonna add two cases you
can<00:04:04.410> look<00:04:05.069> for<00:04:05.280> up-down<00:04:05.670> if<00:04:05.910> you<00:04:06.000> like<00:04:06.180> but<00:04:06.389> in

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
can look for up-down if you like but in

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.910 
can look for up-down if you like but in
this<00:04:06.510> case<00:04:06.720> let's<00:04:06.780> just<00:04:07.079> look<00:04:07.380> for<00:04:07.620> left<00:04:07.799> and

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
this case let's just look for left and

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.059 
this case let's just look for left and
right<00:04:08.010> so<00:04:08.489> we've<00:04:08.579> got<00:04:08.609> a<00:04:08.700> case<00:04:09.019> left<00:04:10.019> and<00:04:10.380> then

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
right so we've got a case left and then

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.789 
right so we've got a case left and then
a<00:04:11.130> colon<00:04:11.400> I'm<00:04:11.700> gonna<00:04:12.180> tab<00:04:12.510> in<00:04:12.810> and<00:04:12.989> so<00:04:13.709> if

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
a colon I'm gonna tab in and so if

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.680 
a colon I'm gonna tab in and so if
that's<00:04:13.950> the<00:04:14.100> case<00:04:14.310> let's<00:04:14.940> go<00:04:15.150> ahead<00:04:15.329> and<00:04:15.450> call

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
that's the case let's go ahead and call

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.710 
that's the case let's go ahead and call
that<00:04:15.959> next<00:04:16.229> slide<00:04:16.289> and<00:04:17.120> then<00:04:18.120> we're<00:04:18.299> going<00:04:18.419> to

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
that next slide and then we're going to

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.289 
that next slide and then we're going to
break<00:04:19.410> after<00:04:19.799> that<00:04:19.829> so<00:04:20.250> no<00:04:20.519> other<00:04:20.700> code<00:04:21.000> gets

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
break after that so no other code gets

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.290 
break after that so no other code gets
executed<00:04:21.479> and<00:04:22.440> we're<00:04:22.919> gonna<00:04:23.039> go<00:04:23.610> back<00:04:23.880> a<00:04:23.909> tab

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
executed and we're gonna go back a tab

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.420 
executed and we're gonna go back a tab
and<00:04:24.630> write<00:04:24.780> a<00:04:24.810> second<00:04:25.289> case<00:04:25.500> this<00:04:26.039> one's<00:04:26.280> gonna

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
and write a second case this one's gonna

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.230 
and write a second case this one's gonna
be

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
be

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.409 
be
to<00:04:27.300> the<00:04:27.389> right<00:04:27.720> and<00:04:28.199> a<00:04:29.039> colon<00:04:29.460> and<00:04:30.180> then<00:04:30.270> I'm

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
to the right and a colon and then I'm

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.610 
to the right and a colon and then I'm
gonna<00:04:30.509> tab<00:04:30.750> in<00:04:30.990> and<00:04:31.680> say<00:04:32.430> back<00:04:33.199> if<00:04:34.199> the<00:04:34.440> user

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
gonna tab in and say back if the user

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.550 
gonna tab in and say back if the user
happens<00:04:34.889> to<00:04:35.340> swipe<00:04:35.789> to<00:04:35.819> the<00:04:36.120> right<00:04:36.300> and<00:04:36.720> then

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
happens to swipe to the right and then

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.740 
happens to swipe to the right and then
we're<00:04:37.919> gonna<00:04:38.009> brake<00:04:38.370> again<00:04:38.580> and<00:04:39.060> we<00:04:39.449> should<00:04:39.509> be

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
we're gonna brake again and we should be

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:40.430 
we're gonna brake again and we should be
all<00:04:39.930> good

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
all good

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.020 
all good
looks<00:04:40.680> like<00:04:40.800> I've<00:04:40.949> already<00:04:41.220> got<00:04:41.340> a<00:04:41.370> closing

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
looks like I've already got a closing

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.820 
looks like I've already got a closing
bracket<00:04:42.210> there<00:04:42.630> that<00:04:42.810> Dreamweaver<00:04:43.080> added<00:04:43.620> for

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
bracket there that Dreamweaver added for

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.129 
bracket there that Dreamweaver added for
me<00:04:43.949> so<00:04:44.190> that<00:04:44.310> should<00:04:44.520> be<00:04:44.639> all<00:04:44.759> in<00:04:44.940> place<00:04:45.150> so

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
me so that should be all in place so

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:47.480 
me so that should be all in place so
this<00:04:46.380> might<00:04:46.560> seem<00:04:46.800> a<00:04:46.830> bit<00:04:46.979> counterintuitive

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
this might seem a bit counterintuitive

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.570 
this might seem a bit counterintuitive
that<00:04:48.210> our<00:04:48.449> swipe<00:04:48.720> gestures<00:04:49.199> effectively<00:04:50.099> work

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
that our swipe gestures effectively work

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.390 
that our swipe gestures effectively work
in<00:04:50.789> the<00:04:50.910> opposite<00:04:51.539> direction<00:04:51.720> of<00:04:52.259> our<00:04:52.740> key

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
in the opposite direction of our key

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.059 
in the opposite direction of our key
events<00:04:54.120> and<00:04:54.300> the<00:04:54.930> reason<00:04:55.259> that<00:04:55.289> is<00:04:55.590> because

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:56.069 
events and the reason that is because

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:59.689 
events and the reason that is because
when<00:04:56.639> I<00:04:56.849> say<00:04:57.569> if<00:04:57.870> I<00:04:58.110> click<00:04:58.919> to<00:04:59.130> the<00:04:59.220> right<00:04:59.430> of

00:04:59.689 --> 00:04:59.699 
when I say if I click to the right of

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:03.010 
when I say if I click to the right of
finger<00:05:00.210> count<00:05:00.449> here<00:05:00.720> and<00:05:00.930> I<00:05:01.080> drag<00:05:01.710> to<00:05:01.740> the<00:05:02.130> left

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
finger count here and I drag to the left

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.960 
finger count here and I drag to the left
the<00:05:04.020> motion<00:05:04.650> you<00:05:05.039> think<00:05:05.400> of<00:05:05.490> it<00:05:05.610> as<00:05:05.729> maybe

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
the motion you think of it as maybe

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.540 
the motion you think of it as maybe
effectively<00:05:06.690> throwing<00:05:07.319> the<00:05:07.860> current<00:05:08.280> screen

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
effectively throwing the current screen

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.320 
effectively throwing the current screen
away<00:05:09.240> so<00:05:09.690> in<00:05:10.050> a<00:05:10.560> left-to-right<00:05:11.430> culture<00:05:12.150> of

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
away so in a left-to-right culture of

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.770 
away so in a left-to-right culture of
kind<00:05:12.780> of<00:05:12.810> reading<00:05:13.169> English<00:05:13.560> you<00:05:14.550> know<00:05:14.780> finger

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
kind of reading English you know finger

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.990 
kind of reading English you know finger
count<00:05:16.050> comes<00:05:16.470> after<00:05:16.860> direction<00:05:17.460> for<00:05:17.669> instance

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
count comes after direction for instance

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.770 
count comes after direction for instance
so<00:05:18.240> as<00:05:18.449> I'm<00:05:19.020> pushing<00:05:19.470> things<00:05:20.009> forward<00:05:20.780> suppose

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
so as I'm pushing things forward suppose

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.559 
so as I'm pushing things forward suppose
this<00:05:22.020> selection<00:05:22.409> is<00:05:22.650> my<00:05:22.889> viewfinder<00:05:23.569> finger

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:24.569 
this selection is my viewfinder finger

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:26.990 
this selection is my viewfinder finger
count<00:05:24.870> comes<00:05:25.409> into<00:05:25.830> view<00:05:25.860> and<00:05:26.400> that's<00:05:26.490> a<00:05:26.669> later

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
count comes into view and that's a later

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.170 
count comes into view and that's a later
item<00:05:27.449> then<00:05:27.720> say<00:05:27.960> direction<00:05:28.560> so<00:05:29.220> as<00:05:29.400> I<00:05:29.490> swipe<00:05:29.909> to

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
item then say direction so as I swipe to

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.899 
item then say direction so as I swipe to
the<00:05:30.330> left<00:05:30.360> I'm<00:05:30.870> moving<00:05:31.710> forward<00:05:32.219> if<00:05:32.400> I<00:05:32.610> swipe

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:32.909 
the left I'm moving forward if I swipe

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:34.999 
the left I'm moving forward if I swipe
to<00:05:33.120> the<00:05:33.210> right<00:05:33.240> I'm<00:05:33.719> kind<00:05:34.020> of<00:05:34.050> going<00:05:34.259> back<00:05:34.740> in

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:35.009 
to the right I'm kind of going back in

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:36.589 
to the right I'm kind of going back in
space<00:05:35.340> so<00:05:36.060> it's<00:05:36.180> a<00:05:36.270> little<00:05:36.479> bit

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:36.599 
space so it's a little bit

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:38.240 
space so it's a little bit
counterintuitive<00:05:36.990> but<00:05:37.770> something<00:05:38.130> to<00:05:38.190> think

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
counterintuitive but something to think

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.159 
counterintuitive but something to think
about<00:05:38.610> and<00:05:38.849> of<00:05:38.940> course<00:05:39.150> if<00:05:39.300> you<00:05:39.389> add<00:05:39.630> up<00:05:39.930> or

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
about and of course if you add up or

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:41.659 
about and of course if you add up or
down<00:05:40.349> you're<00:05:40.590> gonna<00:05:40.680> find<00:05:40.979> the<00:05:41.159> same<00:05:41.370> thing

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
down you're gonna find the same thing

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:43.999 
down you're gonna find the same thing
there<00:05:41.909> I<00:05:42.090> switch<00:05:42.840> back<00:05:43.080> to<00:05:43.139> the<00:05:43.349> finder<00:05:43.830> and

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:44.009 
there I switch back to the finder and

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:46.999 
there I switch back to the finder and
open<00:05:44.940> up<00:05:45.000> the<00:05:45.150> corresponding<00:05:46.009> index.html

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:47.009 
open up the corresponding index.html

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:49.999 
open up the corresponding index.html

to the arrow keys working if I click and
drag<00:05:53.009> I<00:05:53.520> should<00:05:53.789> be<00:05:53.880> able<00:05:53.940> to<00:05:54.060> swipe<00:05:54.330> the<00:05:54.630> next

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
drag I should be able to swipe the next

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.790 
drag I should be able to swipe the next
screen<00:05:55.280> there<00:05:56.280> we<00:05:56.460> go

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
screen there we go

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.249 
screen there we go
and<00:05:58.800> it<00:05:59.039> works<00:05:59.190> if<00:05:59.340> I<00:05:59.430> go<00:05:59.550> backwards<00:05:59.940> -<00:06:00.259> all

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:01.259 
and it works if I go backwards - all

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:03.110 
and it works if I go backwards - all
right<00:06:01.469> we're<00:06:01.860> going<00:06:02.099> a<00:06:02.190> long<00:06:02.370> way<00:06:02.580> towards

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
right we're going a long way towards

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.420 
right we're going a long way towards
having<00:06:03.509> a<00:06:03.870> responsive<00:06:04.620> presentation<00:06:05.250> and
