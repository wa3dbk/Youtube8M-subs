00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
what is going on everybody and welcome

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.519 
what is going on everybody and welcome
back<00:00:02.129> to<00:00:02.850> another<00:00:02.879> Python<00:00:03.780> and<00:00:04.110> robotics

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
back to another Python and robotics

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.289 
back to another Python and robotics
tutorial<00:00:05.040> video<00:00:05.250> in<00:00:05.279> the<00:00:05.400> last<00:00:05.580> video<00:00:05.879> we<00:00:06.150> got

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
tutorial video in the last video we got

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.530 
tutorial video in the last video we got
our<00:00:06.540> robot<00:00:07.290> car<00:00:07.500> to<00:00:07.950> turn<00:00:08.460> left<00:00:08.700> in<00:00:08.880> turn<00:00:09.059> right

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
our robot car to turn left in turn right

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.200 
our robot car to turn left in turn right
and<00:00:09.870> in<00:00:10.800> this<00:00:10.889> video<00:00:11.099> we<00:00:11.429> want<00:00:11.550> to<00:00:11.639> do<00:00:11.820> is<00:00:12.059> we

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
and in this video we want to do is we

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.660 
and in this video we want to do is we
want<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.450> program<00:00:12.719> it<00:00:13.110> to<00:00:13.290> pivot<00:00:13.590> left<00:00:14.460> and

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
want to program it to pivot left and

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.519 
want to program it to pivot left and
right<00:00:14.820> because<00:00:15.000> then<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.360> turn<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:16.080> would

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
right because then the turn it would

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.170 
right because then the turn it would
have<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.800> gain<00:00:16.949> forward<00:00:17.430> ground<00:00:17.699> whereas<00:00:18.029> in<00:00:18.119> a

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
have to gain forward ground whereas in a

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.790 
have to gain forward ground whereas in a
pivot<00:00:18.480> it<00:00:18.600> would<00:00:18.750> just<00:00:18.930> spin<00:00:19.140> in<00:00:19.230> place<00:00:19.260> so

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
pivot it would just spin in place so

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.210 
pivot it would just spin in place so
let's<00:00:20.699> go<00:00:20.850> ahead<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.090> sudo<00:00:21.810> nano<00:00:22.050> robot<00:00:22.920> too

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
let's go ahead and sudo nano robot too

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.109 
let's go ahead and sudo nano robot too
high<00:00:24.500> and<00:00:25.500> here's<00:00:26.070> our<00:00:26.220> file<00:00:26.519> let's<00:00:26.820> go<00:00:26.939> down

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
high and here's our file let's go down

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.970 
high and here's our file let's go down
to<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.330> very<00:00:27.420> bottom<00:00:27.689> we<00:00:28.500> don't<00:00:28.650> need<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.890> to

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
to the very bottom we don't need it to

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.040 
to the very bottom we don't need it to
turn<00:00:29.189> right<00:00:29.460> anymore<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.150> now<00:00:30.660> let's<00:00:30.929> go

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
turn right anymore and now let's go

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.590 
turn right anymore and now let's go
ahead<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.679> define<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:33.170> pivot<00:00:34.760> underscore<00:00:35.760> left

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
ahead and define a pivot underscore left

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.470 
ahead and define a pivot underscore left
time<00:00:37.380> frame<00:00:37.800> :<00:00:38.430> 1<00:00:38.940> 2<00:00:39.120> 3<00:00:39.300> 4<00:00:39.690> in<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:41.399> now<00:00:42.329> we're

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
time frame : 1 2 3 4 in it and now we're

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.420 
time frame : 1 2 3 4 in it and now we're
ready<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.840> go<00:00:43.370> so<00:00:44.370> now<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:45.059> pivot<00:00:45.510> left<00:00:46.289> what<00:00:47.280> we

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
ready to go so now to pivot left what we

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.970 
ready to go so now to pivot left what we
would<00:00:47.640> need<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:48.180> sense<00:00:48.539> forward<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.500> in<00:00:49.890> the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
would need is sense forward is in the

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.860 
would need is sense forward is in the
direction<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:51.180> know<00:00:51.300> going<00:00:51.600> right

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
direction of you know going right

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.010 
direction of you know going right
on-screen<00:00:52.670> to<00:00:53.670> pivot<00:00:53.910> left<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.840> wheels

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
on-screen to pivot left the wheels

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.319 
on-screen to pivot left the wheels
closest<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:57.469> the<00:00:58.469> screen<00:00:58.829> would<00:00:59.760> need<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.180> move

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
closest to the screen would need to move

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.179 
closest to the screen would need to move
forward<00:01:02.270> whereas<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:04.229> wheels<00:01:04.920> in<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.159> back

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
forward whereas the wheels in the back

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.149 
forward whereas the wheels in the back
would<00:01:06.030> need<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.299> move<00:01:06.619> backwards<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.890> that

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
would need to move backwards and that

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.620 
would need to move backwards and that
would<00:01:08.310> help<00:01:08.400> its<00:01:08.610> spin<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.360> left

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
would help its spin in the left

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.960 
would help its spin in the left
direction<00:01:09.960> or<00:01:10.439> maybe<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.280> better<00:01:11.430> word<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.880> be

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
direction or maybe the better word to be

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.370 
direction or maybe the better word to be
would<00:01:12.210> be<00:01:12.330> pivot<00:01:12.689> or<00:01:12.840> turn<00:01:13.710> counterclockwise

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
would be pivot or turn counterclockwise

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.620 
would be pivot or turn counterclockwise
so<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.470> do<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.490> make<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:17.939> happen<00:01:18.150> what

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
so to do that to make that happen what

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.940 
so to do that to make that happen what
we<00:01:18.750> want<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.049> do<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.880> we<00:01:20.880> would<00:01:21.030> want<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.420> use<00:01:21.950> 7

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
we want to do is we would want to use 7

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:32.899 
we want to do is we would want to use 7
as<00:01:23.130> true<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.210> GPIO<00:01:24.659> 2<00:01:24.810> output<00:01:26.630> 7<00:01:28.430> true<00:01:29.479> and<00:01:31.909> then

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
as true so GPIO 2 output 7 true and then

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.289 
as true so GPIO 2 output 7 true and then
we're<00:01:33.090> going<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.240> need<00:01:33.479> 11<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.320> be<00:01:34.439> false<00:01:35.299> the

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
we're going to need 11 to be false the

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.380 
we're going to need 11 to be false the
GPIO<00:01:36.810> dot<00:01:37.110> output<00:01:38.090> 11<00:01:39.090> falls<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.530> then<00:01:41.460> 13

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
GPIO dot output 11 falls and then 13

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:49.660 
GPIO dot output 11 falls and then 13
should<00:01:42.780> be<00:01:42.869> true<00:01:45.799> and<00:01:46.799> then<00:01:47.159> 15

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
should be true and then 15

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.850 
should be true and then 15
should<00:01:50.670> be<00:01:50.909> false<00:01:54.079> now<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.259> ought<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.530> give

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
going to run it once just to clear

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.880 
going to run it once just to clear
everything<00:02:36.060> for<00:02:36.540> myself<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:37.670> battery<00:02:39.890> and

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
everything for myself and battery and

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.759 
everything for myself and battery and
let's<00:02:41.190> run<00:02:41.340> it<00:02:41.459> again

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.440 

okay<00:02:46.769> so<00:02:47.280> that<00:02:47.430> worked<00:02:47.579> out<00:02:47.700> so<00:02:48.060> that<00:02:48.209> would

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
okay so that worked out so that would

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.380 
okay so that worked out so that would
make<00:02:48.660> it<00:02:48.810> pivot<00:02:49.170> left<00:02:49.890> now<00:02:50.549> the<00:02:51.000> last<00:02:51.209> thing

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
make it pivot left now the last thing

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.140 
make it pivot left now the last thing
that<00:02:51.599> we<00:02:51.690> really<00:02:52.019> want<00:02:52.049> to<00:02:52.290> do<00:02:52.410> is<00:02:52.650> pivot<00:02:53.519> right

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
that we really want to do is pivot right

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.340 
that we really want to do is pivot right
and<00:02:55.040> that<00:02:56.040> should<00:02:56.310> do<00:02:56.459> for<00:02:56.760> all<00:02:56.940> of<00:02:56.970> our

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
and that should do for all of our

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.020 
and that should do for all of our
commands<00:02:58.350> or<00:02:58.470> at<00:02:58.590> least<00:02:58.769> you<00:02:59.190> know<00:02:59.280> not

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
commands or at least you know not

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.849 
commands or at least you know not
commands<00:03:00.389> I<00:03:00.600> suppose<00:03:00.870> I<00:03:01.049> guess<00:03:01.200> commands<00:03:01.560> yeah

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
commands I suppose I guess commands yeah

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.680 
commands I suppose I guess commands yeah
as<00:03:01.920> far<00:03:02.250> as<00:03:02.310> you<00:03:02.819> know<00:03:02.910> what<00:03:02.940> we<00:03:03.150> want<00:03:03.540> this

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
as far as you know what we want this

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.819 
as far as you know what we want this
robot<00:03:04.109> to<00:03:04.230> be<00:03:04.260> able<00:03:04.440> to<00:03:04.590> do<00:03:04.799> so<00:03:05.069> now<00:03:05.220> define

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
robot to be able to do so now define

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:12.710 
robot to be able to do so now define
pivot<00:03:07.829> right<00:03:08.549> time<00:03:09.510> frame<00:03:09.859> as<00:03:11.389> usual<00:03:12.389> we<00:03:12.569> need

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
pivot right time frame as usual we need

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.110 
pivot right time frame as usual we need
the<00:03:12.840> individual<00:03:13.350> arms<00:03:13.709> and<00:03:13.950> now<00:03:14.609> we<00:03:14.670> want<00:03:15.000> to

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
the individual arms and now we want to

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.690 
the individual arms and now we want to
begin<00:03:15.209> so<00:03:16.139> what's<00:03:16.859> going<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.069> change<00:03:17.400> well

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
begin so what's going to change well

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.580 
begin so what's going to change well
basically<00:03:18.299> I<00:03:19.079> know<00:03:19.859> this<00:03:20.130> got<00:03:20.400> us<00:03:20.549> last<00:03:20.790> time

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
basically I know this got us last time

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.110 
basically I know this got us last time
so<00:03:22.590> I<00:03:22.620> hope<00:03:22.769> it<00:03:22.950> doesn't<00:03:23.100> get<00:03:23.280> me<00:03:23.459> again<00:03:23.579> but<00:03:24.000> we

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
so I hope it doesn't get me again but we

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.270 
so I hope it doesn't get me again but we
should<00:03:24.299> just<00:03:24.329> have<00:03:24.630> to<00:03:24.780> flip<00:03:25.019> everything<00:03:25.319> I

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.080 

think<00:03:29.280> we'll<00:03:29.400> get<00:03:29.489> away<00:03:29.670> with<00:03:29.850> flipping

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
think we'll get away with flipping

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.059 
think we'll get away with flipping
everything<00:03:30.510> this<00:03:30.600> time<00:03:30.660> so<00:03:31.200> did<00:03:31.829> you<00:03:31.920> pee<00:03:32.040> out

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
everything this time so did you pee out

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:39.080 
everything this time so did you pee out

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
robot tune-up I run it and sho'nuff so

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.660 
robot tune-up I run it and sho'nuff so
the<00:04:17.049> wheels<00:04:17.290> closest<00:04:17.680> to<00:04:17.769> us<00:04:17.890> spun<00:04:18.220> backwards

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:18.670 
the wheels closest to us spun backwards

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.759 
the wheels closest to us spun backwards
whereas<00:04:19.420> the<00:04:19.510> ones<00:04:19.660> furthest<00:04:20.019> from<00:04:20.140> us<00:04:20.350> spun

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
whereas the ones furthest from us spun

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.010 
whereas the ones furthest from us spun
forwards<00:04:21.370> thus<00:04:22.000> making<00:04:22.330> us<00:04:22.540> turn<00:04:22.780> in<00:04:22.900> a

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
forwards thus making us turn in a

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.420 
forwards thus making us turn in a
clockwise<00:04:23.380> rotation<00:04:24.240> or<00:04:25.240> pivot<00:04:25.930> right<00:04:26.430> so

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
clockwise rotation or pivot right so

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.190 
clockwise rotation or pivot right so
that's<00:04:27.520> it<00:04:27.730> for<00:04:27.940> that<00:04:27.970> now<00:04:28.630> what<00:04:28.870> do<00:04:28.930> we<00:04:29.020> want

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
that's it for that now what do we want

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.350 
that's it for that now what do we want
to<00:04:29.290> do<00:04:29.380> well<00:04:29.700> now<00:04:30.700> that<00:04:30.850> we've<00:04:30.940> done<00:04:31.120> that<00:04:31.300> we

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
to do well now that we've done that we

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.960 
to do well now that we've done that we
want<00:04:31.720> some<00:04:32.140> way<00:04:32.170> to<00:04:32.440> be<00:04:33.250> able<00:04:33.970> to<00:04:34.060> control<00:04:34.600> our

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
want some way to be able to control our

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.330 
want some way to be able to control our
car<00:04:36.970> so<00:04:37.450> you<00:04:37.540> don't<00:04:37.660> want<00:04:37.780> to<00:04:37.870> have<00:04:37.990> to<00:04:38.110> like

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
car so you don't want to have to like

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.200 
car so you don't want to have to like
pre-program<00:04:39.340> the<00:04:39.490> car<00:04:39.700> now<00:04:39.850> there's<00:04:40.030> a<00:04:40.090> few

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
pre-program the car now there's a few

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.580 
pre-program the car now there's a few
ways<00:04:40.420> that<00:04:40.450> you<00:04:40.600> can<00:04:40.780> do<00:04:40.870> this<00:04:41.050> either<00:04:41.170> you<00:04:41.440> can

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
ways that you can do this either you can

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.880 
ways that you can do this either you can
allow<00:04:41.860> the<00:04:42.180> robot<00:04:43.180> to<00:04:43.330> accept<00:04:43.930> controls<00:04:44.530> from

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
allow the robot to accept controls from

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.890 
allow the robot to accept controls from
you<00:04:45.070> the<00:04:45.250> user<00:04:45.460> or<00:04:46.030> you<00:04:46.180> can<00:04:46.330> make<00:04:46.450> the<00:04:46.570> robot

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
you the user or you can make the robot

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.140 
you the user or you can make the robot
somewhat<00:04:47.260> autonomous<00:04:47.680> now<00:04:48.580> the<00:04:48.640> problem

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
somewhat autonomous now the problem

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.000 
somewhat autonomous now the problem
right<00:04:49.300> now<00:04:49.360> with<00:04:49.540> our<00:04:49.810> little<00:04:50.080> car<00:04:50.290> is<00:04:50.560> we

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
right now with our little car is we

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.650 
right now with our little car is we
don't<00:04:51.070> have<00:04:51.220> any<00:04:51.370> sort<00:04:51.610> of<00:04:51.670> real<00:04:51.880> sensor<00:04:52.360> to

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
don't have any sort of real sensor to

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.860 
don't have any sort of real sensor to
sense<00:04:52.690> when<00:04:53.200> anything<00:04:54.100> is<00:04:54.220> happening<00:04:54.640> so<00:04:55.150> we

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
sense when anything is happening so we

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.230 
sense when anything is happening so we
can't<00:04:56.050> really<00:04:56.200> make<00:04:56.290> it<00:04:56.530> autonomous<00:04:57.190> just<00:04:57.760> yet

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
can't really make it autonomous just yet

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.300 
can't really make it autonomous just yet
so<00:04:58.270> first<00:04:59.050> we<00:04:59.169> want<00:04:59.350> to<00:04:59.380> make<00:04:59.500> it<00:04:59.650> controllable

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
so first we want to make it controllable

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.340 
so first we want to make it controllable
and<00:05:00.490> even<00:05:01.030> if<00:05:01.150> you<00:05:01.240> made<00:05:01.540> it<00:05:01.570> autonomous<00:05:02.230> you

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
and even if you made it autonomous you

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.420 
and even if you made it autonomous you
want<00:05:02.530> it<00:05:02.620> you<00:05:02.710> would<00:05:02.830> want<00:05:02.860> to<00:05:03.070> kind<00:05:03.370> of

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
want it you would want to kind of

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.730 
want it you would want to kind of
eventually<00:05:04.150> have<00:05:04.419> some<00:05:04.690> sort<00:05:04.900> of<00:05:04.990> control<00:05:05.560> to

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
eventually have some sort of control to

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.000 
eventually have some sort of control to
it<00:05:05.890> as<00:05:06.669> a<00:05:06.730> sort<00:05:07.150> of<00:05:07.180> failsafe<00:05:07.419> if<00:05:07.870> anything<00:05:08.290> so

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
it as a sort of failsafe if anything so

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.470 
it as a sort of failsafe if anything so
what<00:05:09.669> we're<00:05:09.760> going<00:05:09.850> to<00:05:09.910> be<00:05:10.000> doing<00:05:10.120> in<00:05:10.240> the<00:05:10.300> next

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:10.480 
what we're going to be doing in the next

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.790 
what we're going to be doing in the next
video<00:05:10.690> is<00:05:10.840> actually<00:05:11.200> working<00:05:11.440> with<00:05:11.740> some

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
video is actually working with some

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.840 
video is actually working with some
input<00:05:12.610> that<00:05:12.880> we<00:05:13.090> can<00:05:13.270> give<00:05:13.530> to<00:05:14.530> this<00:05:15.010> robot<00:05:15.220> to

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
input that we can give to this robot to

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.790 
input that we can give to this robot to
use<00:05:16.060> our<00:05:16.390> functions<00:05:16.930> however<00:05:17.320> we<00:05:17.560> see<00:05:17.770> fit

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
use our functions however we see fit

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.320 
use our functions however we see fit
that<00:05:18.220> way<00:05:18.370> we'd<00:05:18.520> have<00:05:18.700> to<00:05:18.790> pre-program

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
that way we'd have to pre-program

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.510 
that way we'd have to pre-program
anything<00:05:19.720> so<00:05:20.470> that's<00:05:20.919> what<00:05:21.070> you<00:05:21.160> have<00:05:21.250> to<00:05:21.280> look

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
anything so that's what you have to look

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.650 
anything so that's what you have to look
forward<00:05:21.730> to<00:05:21.910> hopefully<00:05:22.180> you<00:05:22.360> guys<00:05:22.450> are
