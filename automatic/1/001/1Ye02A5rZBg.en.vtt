just gonna keep getting better and you
know<00:02:01.720> it<00:02:02.020> because<00:02:02.080> once<00:02:02.350> you<00:02:02.470> already<00:02:02.740> start

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:02.980 
know it because once you already start

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.740 
know it because once you already start
to<00:02:03.010> get<00:02:03.190> upset<00:02:03.460> it's<00:02:03.880> just<00:02:04.180> gonna<00:02:04.270> keep<00:02:04.510> going

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
down from there so you might as well

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.770 
down from there so you might as well
just<00:02:06.010> quit<00:02:06.220> the<00:02:06.340> game<00:02:06.490> for<00:02:07.120> example<00:02:07.210> like<00:02:07.660> if

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
just quit the game for example like if

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.210 
just quit the game for example like if
you're<00:02:08.200> getting<00:02:08.259> spawn<00:02:08.619> trapped<00:02:08.950> and<00:02:09.160> you

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
you're getting spawn trapped and you

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.859 
you're getting spawn trapped and you
know<00:02:09.340> you<00:02:09.429> can't<00:02:09.700> get<00:02:09.819> out<00:02:09.909> of<00:02:09.940> it<00:02:10.179> and<00:02:10.360> you

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
know you can't get out of it and you

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.270 
know you can't get out of it and you
want<00:02:11.050> to<00:02:11.080> keep<00:02:11.260> trying<00:02:11.500> but<00:02:11.830> trust<00:02:12.040> me<00:02:12.129> you

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
want to keep trying but trust me you

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.380 
want to keep trying but trust me you
already<00:02:12.370> know<00:02:12.580> it's<00:02:12.760> not<00:02:12.879> going<00:02:13.030> to<00:02:13.090> work<00:02:13.209> out

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
already know it's not going to work out

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.449 
already know it's not going to work out
that<00:02:13.629> way<00:02:13.750> so<00:02:13.959> might<00:02:14.590> as<00:02:14.680> well<00:02:14.769> just<00:02:14.920> rage<00:02:15.129> quit

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
that way so might as well just rage quit

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:16.979 
that way so might as well just rage quit
it's<00:02:15.970> not<00:02:16.060> really<00:02:16.269> even<00:02:16.330> rage<00:02:16.569> quitting<00:02:16.930> I

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
it's not really even rage quitting I

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.570 
it's not really even rage quitting I
guess<00:02:17.140> just<00:02:17.709> quit<00:02:17.920> the<00:02:18.010> game<00:02:18.159> it's<00:02:18.370> a<00:02:18.430> better

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
guess just quit the game it's a better

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.100 
guess just quit the game it's a better
choice<00:02:18.640> for<00:02:18.849> you<00:02:19.030> and<00:02:19.390> everybody<00:02:19.720> else<00:02:19.780> around

then it could cause trash-talking which
is<00:03:02.350> one<00:03:02.470> of<00:03:02.560> the<00:03:02.620> main<00:03:02.740> factors<00:03:02.920> to<00:03:03.340> rage<00:03:03.490> if

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
is one of the main factors to rage if

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.340 
is one of the main factors to rage if
they're<00:03:03.940> like<00:03:04.120> beating<00:03:04.600> you<00:03:04.690> bad<00:03:04.870> or<00:03:05.110> whatever

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
they're like beating you bad or whatever

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.870 
they're like beating you bad or whatever
and<00:03:05.830> they're<00:03:05.980> just<00:03:06.160> talking<00:03:06.250> about<00:03:06.520> how<00:03:06.700> good

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
and they're just talking about how good

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.430 
and they're just talking about how good
they're<00:03:07.030> doing<00:03:07.060> compared<00:03:07.540> to<00:03:07.600> you<00:03:07.780> you<00:03:08.290> don't

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
they're doing compared to you you don't

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.510 
they're doing compared to you you don't
want<00:03:08.560> to<00:03:08.620> listen<00:03:08.740> to<00:03:08.920> that<00:03:09.040> so<00:03:09.250> be<00:03:09.370> sure<00:03:09.400> to

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
want to listen to that so be sure to

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.220 
want to listen to that so be sure to
mute<00:03:09.700> them<00:03:10.000> don't<00:03:10.570> start<00:03:10.840> arguing<00:03:10.960> with

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
mute them don't start arguing with

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.900 
mute them don't start arguing with
people<00:03:11.560> over<00:03:11.740> the<00:03:11.830> mic<00:03:11.980> it's<00:03:12.250> not<00:03:12.430> worth<00:03:12.730> it

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
people over the mic it's not worth it

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.970 
people over the mic it's not worth it
it's<00:03:13.120> really<00:03:13.450> dumb<00:03:13.660> actually<00:03:13.900> and<00:03:14.470> they're

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
it's really dumb actually and they're

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.320 
it's really dumb actually and they're
probably<00:03:15.100> looking<00:03:15.310> for<00:03:15.520> a<00:03:15.550> reaction<00:03:15.790> anyway

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
probably looking for a reaction anyway

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.600 
probably looking for a reaction anyway
so<00:03:16.390> it's<00:03:16.810> just<00:03:17.170> completely<00:03:17.680> dumb<00:03:17.980> don't

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
so it's just completely dumb don't

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.100 
so it's just completely dumb don't
listen<00:03:18.910> to<00:03:19.090> them<00:03:19.240> and<00:03:19.510> just<00:03:19.630> don't<00:03:19.900> start

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
listen to them and just don't start

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.450 
listen to them and just don't start
arguments<00:03:20.590> and<00:03:20.680> start<00:03:20.890> something<00:03:21.250> because

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 
arguments and start something because

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.190 
arguments and start something because
then<00:03:21.670> you<00:03:21.790> won't<00:03:22.030> be<00:03:22.210> able<00:03:22.480> to<00:03:22.690> get<00:03:22.810> out<00:03:22.930> of<00:03:22.960> it

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
then you won't be able to get out of it

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.260 
then you won't be able to get out of it
