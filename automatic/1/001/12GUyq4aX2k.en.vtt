00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
now I need to find me this piece and

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:19.300 
now I need to find me this piece and
it's<00:02:12.620> on<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:13.280> page<00:02:16.960> guess<00:02:17.960> what<00:02:18.140> me<00:02:18.200> too<00:02:18.320> so

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
it's on the page guess what me too so

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.350 
it's on the page guess what me too so
let's<00:02:19.490> take<00:02:19.640> this<00:02:19.790> one<00:02:20.200> find<00:02:21.200> it<00:02:21.290> up<00:02:22.090> step<00:02:23.090> 3

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
let's take this one find it up step 3

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.850 
let's take this one find it up step 3
over<00:02:23.630> here<00:02:23.810> is<00:02:24.140> to<00:02:25.270> see<00:02:26.270> these<00:02:26.570> are<00:02:26.780> this<00:02:27.140> put

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
over here is to see these are this put

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.710 
over here is to see these are this put
on<00:02:27.980> the<00:02:28.100> side<00:02:28.310> so<00:02:28.580> it's<00:02:28.790> a<00:02:28.880> test<00:02:29.090> each<00:02:29.240> other<00:02:29.450> so

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
on the side so it's a test each other so

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.120 
on the side so it's a test each other so
it<00:02:29.780> doesn't<00:02:30.020> go<00:02:30.110> anywhere<00:02:30.290> in<00:02:30.740> your<00:02:31.520> school<00:02:31.820> so

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
it doesn't go anywhere in your school so

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.310

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
fitness for example here let's take

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.580 
fitness for example here let's take
these<00:02:39.320> here<00:02:39.940> now<00:02:40.940> from<00:02:41.300> half<00:02:41.600> ways<00:02:41.840> you<00:02:42.440> want

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
these here now from half ways you want
