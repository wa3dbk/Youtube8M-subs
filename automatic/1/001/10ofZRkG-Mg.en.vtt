00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.760 
earlier in the video but I'm tired of
taking<00:01:56.310> reshoots<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.270> only<00:01:58.170> carry<00:01:58.590> this

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
taking reshoots I only carry this

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.700 
taking reshoots I only carry this
because<00:01:59.250> I<00:01:59.579> had<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.939> money<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:01.409> EAB

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
because I had the money and the EAB

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.060 
because I had the money and the EAB
while<00:02:02.280> it's<00:02:02.460> light<00:02:03.200> sure<00:02:04.200> it's<00:02:04.409> lighter<00:02:04.710> if

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
while it's light sure it's lighter if

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.440 
while it's light sure it's lighter if
you<00:02:05.310> want<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.579> carry<00:02:05.759> something<00:02:05.850> like<00:02:06.270> that

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
you want to carry something like that

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.449 
you want to carry something like that
all<00:02:06.659> day<00:02:06.689> but<00:02:07.110> when<00:02:07.259> I'm<00:02:07.350> using<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.829> knife<00:02:08.250> like

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
all day but when I'm using a knife like

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.740 
all day but when I'm using a knife like
this<00:02:08.520> it's<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:11.190> weight<00:02:11.400> is<00:02:11.700> not<00:02:11.910> as<00:02:12.180> much<00:02:12.510> of<00:02:12.569> a

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
this it's the weight is not as much of a

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.680 
this it's the weight is not as much of a
factor<00:02:12.989> as<00:02:13.319> if<00:02:13.470> it

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
factor as if it

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.830 
factor as if it
my<00:02:13.900> EDC<00:02:14.410> knife<00:02:14.700> but<00:02:16.740> what's<00:02:17.740> there<00:02:17.890> to<00:02:17.980> talk

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
my EDC knife but what's there to talk

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
my EDC knife but what's there to talk
well<00:02:19.840> when<00:02:20.050> you<00:02:20.170> use<00:02:20.320> it<00:02:20.530> it's<00:02:20.680> really

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
well when you use it it's really

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.490 
well when you use it it's really
comfortable<00:02:21.490> that's<00:02:22.000> what<00:02:22.210> I<00:02:22.240> like<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:22.870> fits
