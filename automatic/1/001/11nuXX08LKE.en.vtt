 about this a popular belief says that 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.640
 boring is not immune earth he is something 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.629

 is a demonic manifestation of 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.579
 obscure units of the unit therefore 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.460
 there's no way to see 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.859
 the most plausible belief is that chaco 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.969
 is a rental killer left to the 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:01:01.339

 escaping from the news every time 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.580
 part only that the apparatus that the cock 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:12.400

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.160
 toxicity and income 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.940

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:21.010
 valuable inhabitants seems unimaginable 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.450

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.670
 continue like this 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.550
 whatever its annoying story 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.250
