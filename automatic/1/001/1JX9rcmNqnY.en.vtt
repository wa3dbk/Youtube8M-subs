Carl's been pointing out to me just how
critical<00:00:02.220> you<00:00:02.490> retrieve<00:00:02.879> speed<00:00:03.179> is<00:00:03.300> and<00:00:03.449> it's

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
critical you retrieve speed is and it's

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:04.670 
critical you retrieve speed is and it's
one<00:00:03.629> of<00:00:03.659> those<00:00:03.810> things<00:00:03.870> that<00:00:04.259> a<00:00:04.380> lot<00:00:04.440> of<00:00:04.589> people

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
forget about really quickly and that's

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.450 
forget about really quickly and that's
the<00:00:06.420> pace<00:00:06.660> that<00:00:06.839> you<00:00:06.960> retrieve<00:00:07.290> your<00:00:07.440> app<00:00:07.770> now

suggested<00:00:12.900> that<00:00:12.990> when<00:00:13.110> we<00:00:13.200> cast<00:00:13.410> in<00:00:13.710> nice<00:00:13.920> and

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
suggested that when we cast in nice and

close<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.580> shore<00:00:14.820> we<00:00:15.269> just<00:00:15.480> roll<00:00:15.690> our<00:00:15.839> lure

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
close to the shore we just roll our lure

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.689 
close to the shore we just roll our lure
out<00:00:16.170> slowly<00:00:16.470> as<00:00:16.770> we<00:00:16.830> get<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.070> bit<00:00:17.220> further<00:00:17.430> out

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
out slowly as we get a bit further out

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.519 
out slowly as we get a bit further out
we<00:00:17.850> may<00:00:17.970> want<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.240> pause<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.480> bit<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:19.050> continue

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529

our slow steady whine that's the whole

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.689 
our slow steady whine that's the whole
idea<00:00:22.140> keep<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:22.859> slow<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.189> keep<00:00:23.369> it<00:00:23.490> in<00:00:23.550> their

idea keep it slow and keep it in their
face<00:00:23.970> now<00:00:24.869> we<00:00:24.930> talked<00:00:25.140> about<00:00:25.260> gear<00:00:25.590> ratios

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
face now we talked about gear ratios

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.620 
face now we talked about gear ratios
quite<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.250> bit<00:00:26.460> but<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.910> lot<00:00:27.150> of<00:00:27.180> people<00:00:27.449> don't

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
quite a bit but a lot of people don't

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.019 
quite a bit but a lot of people don't
know<00:00:27.689> exactly<00:00:28.109> what<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.320> gear<00:00:28.529> ratio<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:29.099> now

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
know exactly what a gear ratio is now

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.970 
know exactly what a gear ratio is now
wave<00:00:30.269> basically<00:00:30.720> what<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.929> gear<00:00:31.109> ratio<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.650> is

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
wave basically what the gear ratio is is

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.250 
wave basically what the gear ratio is is
this<00:00:32.130> one<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.880> one<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.390> four<00:00:33.570> point<00:00:33.809> nine<00:00:33.840> or

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
this one is one to four point nine or

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.900 
this one is one to four point nine or
four<00:00:34.410> point<00:00:34.620> nine<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.920> one<00:00:35.100> so<00:00:35.760> what<00:00:35.880> that

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
four point nine to one so what that

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.850 
four point nine to one so what that
means<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.480> everyone<00:00:36.899> turn<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.380> handle<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:37.800> do

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
means to everyone turn of a handle I do

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.490 
means to everyone turn of a handle I do
that<00:00:38.489> spool<00:00:38.969> will<00:00:39.329> revolve<00:00:39.660> four<00:00:40.200> point<00:00:40.440> nine

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
that spool will revolve four point nine

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.220 
that spool will revolve four point nine
times<00:00:40.890> now<00:00:41.850> this<00:00:42.000> particular<00:00:42.149> series<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.050> rule

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
times now this particular series of rule

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.840 
times now this particular series of rule
comes<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.800> three<00:00:44.010> different<00:00:44.040> gear<00:00:44.460> ratios

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
comes in three different gear ratios

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.490 
comes in three different gear ratios
you've<00:00:45.300> got<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.539> slow<00:00:45.719> one<00:00:45.930> this<00:00:46.079> one<00:00:46.289> here

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
you've got the slow one this one here

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.100 
you've got the slow one this one here
4.9<00:00:47.160> you've<00:00:47.730> got<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.000> next<00:00:48.239> one<00:00:48.360> up<00:00:48.480> six<00:00:48.840> point

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
4.9 you've got the next one up six point

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.139 
4.9 you've got the next one up six point
three<00:00:49.170> two<00:00:49.440> one<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:50.190> fast<00:00:50.460> want<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.850> be<00:00:51.059> on

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
three two one and the fast want to be on

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.490 
three two one and the fast want to be on
that<00:00:51.180> one<00:00:51.420> again<00:00:51.660> which<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:51.870> seven<00:00:52.110> point<00:00:52.410> one

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
that one again which is seven point one

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.160 
that one again which is seven point one
to<00:00:52.770> one<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.070> it's<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.250> really<00:00:53.550> quick<00:00:53.879> real<00:00:54.180> now

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
to one so it's a really quick real now

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.450 
to one so it's a really quick real now
you<00:00:55.230> might<00:00:55.410> think<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> really<00:00:56.100> quick<00:00:56.250> real

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
you might think I a really quick real

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.220 
you might think I a really quick real
sounds<00:00:56.730> like<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.879> good<00:00:57.000> way<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.210> go<00:00:57.420> at<00:00:57.690> the

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
sounds like a good way to go at the

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.599 
sounds like a good way to go at the
moment<00:00:58.379> I'm<00:00:58.559> actually<00:00:58.710> using<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.100> slower<00:00:59.399> one

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
moment I'm actually using the slower one

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.369 
moment I'm actually using the slower one
the<00:00:59.730> 4.9<00:01:00.359> because<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.809> means<00:01:00.930> i<00:01:01.020> can<00:01:01.170> just<00:01:01.289> have

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
the 4.9 because it means i can just have

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.709 
the 4.9 because it means i can just have
a<00:01:01.410> nice<00:01:01.620> slow<00:01:02.010> steady<00:01:02.340> whine<00:01:02.640> now<00:01:03.210> Lou<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.539> just
