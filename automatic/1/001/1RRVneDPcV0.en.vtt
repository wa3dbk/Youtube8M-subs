lifter kind of hanging down here which I

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.650 
lifter kind of hanging down here which I
think<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.850> figured<00:00:45.000> out<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.210> problem<00:00:45.329> that'll

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
think I figured out the problem that'll

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.209 
think I figured out the problem that'll
be<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.840> different<00:00:45.989> update<00:00:46.350> so<00:00:46.980> it's<00:00:47.129> gonna

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
be in a different update so it's gonna

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.440 
be in a different update so it's gonna
be<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.399> little<00:00:47.610> loud<00:00:47.760> down<00:00:48.000> here<00:00:48.210> because<00:00:48.300> I'm

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
be a little loud down here because I'm

this is just the second day of running

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.430 
this is just the second day of running
this<00:00:58.710> pump<00:00:59.010> see<00:01:00.000> it's<00:01:00.180> nice<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.420> frothy<00:01:00.960> I'm

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
this pump see it's nice and frothy I'm

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:09.690 
this pump see it's nice and frothy I'm
gonna<00:01:01.559> take<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.859> lid<00:01:02.070> off<00:01:02.100> here

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.370 

nice<00:01:10.390> and<00:01:10.600> frothy<00:01:10.900> this<00:01:11.380> stuff<00:01:11.590> is<00:01:11.770> really

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
dark it's pulling out a lot of solid

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.780 
dark it's pulling out a lot of solid
stuff<00:01:17.620> I<00:01:17.800> don't<00:01:17.950> know<00:01:18.010> what<00:01:18.100> the<00:01:18.190> solid<00:01:18.580> stuff

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
stuff I don't know what the solid stuff

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
stuff I don't know what the solid stuff
is<00:01:19.060> but<00:01:19.360> it<00:01:20.200> out<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:21.640> yeah<00:01:22.090> it's<00:01:22.240> working<00:01:22.390> very

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
is but it out so yeah it's working very

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:34.200 
is but it out so yeah it's working very
well<00:01:31.710> well<00:01:32.710> yeah<00:01:32.830> and<00:01:33.130> uh<00:01:33.220> so<00:01:33.820> a<00:01:33.850> little<00:01:34.119> bit

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
well well yeah and uh so a little bit

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.480 
well well yeah and uh so a little bit
about<00:01:34.390> this<00:01:34.540> pump<00:01:34.840> it's<00:01:35.020> very<00:01:35.350> very<00:01:35.770> quiet<00:01:36.130> I

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
about this pump it's very very quiet I

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.770 
about this pump it's very very quiet I
know<00:01:36.550> we<00:01:36.790> can't<00:01:37.030> really<00:01:37.210> tell<00:01:37.479> right<00:01:37.750> now

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
know we can't really tell right now

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.779 
know we can't really tell right now
because<00:01:38.140> of<00:01:38.560> all<00:01:38.860> the<00:01:39.430> water<00:01:39.610> noise<00:01:39.940> um<00:01:41.789> the

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
because of all the water noise um the

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:47.460 
because of all the water noise um the
the<00:01:43.979> Sentra<00:01:44.979> 5000<00:01:45.820> my<00:01:45.940> believe<00:01:46.509> was<00:01:46.810> in<00:01:47.200> the

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
the Sentra 5000 my believe was in the

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.020 
the Sentra 5000 my believe was in the
neighborhood<00:01:47.890> of<00:01:47.920> five<00:01:48.220> hundred<00:01:48.550> gallons<00:01:48.850> per

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
neighborhood of five hundred gallons per

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.350 
neighborhood of five hundred gallons per
hour<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:50.170> one<00:01:50.410> is<00:01:50.590> only<00:01:50.770> 200<00:01:51.520> and<00:01:51.580> like<00:01:51.820> 40

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
hour this one is only 200 and like 40

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.980 
hour this one is only 200 and like 40
something<00:01:52.690> gallons<00:01:53.229> per<00:01:53.410> hour<00:01:53.500> but<00:01:54.490> it<00:01:55.210> sucks

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
something gallons per hour but it sucks

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.790 
something gallons per hour but it sucks
it<00:01:56.560> um<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:57.850> draws<00:01:58.210> in<00:01:58.479> more<00:01:58.750> air<00:01:59.020> so<00:01:59.350> it's<00:01:59.530> air

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
it um it draws in more air so it's air

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.300 
it um it draws in more air so it's air
ratio<00:02:00.039> to<00:02:00.610> water<00:02:00.880> mixture<00:02:01.390> is<00:02:01.539> like<00:02:01.810> a<00:02:02.310> hundred

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
ratio to water mixture is like a hundred

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.730 
ratio to water mixture is like a hundred
times<00:02:03.550> better<00:02:03.910> than<00:02:04.119> that<00:02:04.300> of<00:02:04.360> the<00:02:04.509> cetera<00:02:05.320> um

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
times better than that of the cetera um

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.249 
times better than that of the cetera um
and<00:02:06.490> also<00:02:06.759> another<00:02:07.090> thing<00:02:07.330> with<00:02:07.960> it<00:02:08.080> being

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
and also another thing with it being

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.060 
and also another thing with it being
quiet<00:02:08.729> quieter<00:02:09.729> and<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:11.530> gallons<00:02:11.860> per<00:02:12.010> hour

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
quiet quieter and the gallons per hour

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.449 
quiet quieter and the gallons per hour
or<00:02:12.340> whatever<00:02:12.459> um<00:02:13.239> it<00:02:13.959> also<00:02:14.140> only<00:02:14.530> runs<00:02:14.860> at<00:02:15.070> 11

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
or whatever um it also only runs at 11

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.360 
or whatever um it also only runs at 11
watts<00:02:15.730> so<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:17.230> power<00:02:17.440> consumption<00:02:17.980> on<00:02:18.100> it<00:02:18.250> is

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
watts so the power consumption on it is

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.289 
watts so the power consumption on it is
I<00:02:18.750> mean<00:02:19.750> it's<00:02:19.900> got<00:02:20.019> a<00:02:20.049> very<00:02:20.380> low<00:02:20.620> power

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
I mean it's got a very low power

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.449 
I mean it's got a very low power
footprint<00:02:22.299> I<00:02:22.420> guess<00:02:22.600> you<00:02:22.720> could<00:02:22.870> say<00:02:23.079> um<00:02:23.769> but

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
footprint I guess you could say um but

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.520 
footprint I guess you could say um but
it<00:02:24.549> works<00:02:24.700> very<00:02:24.940> well<00:02:25.060> it's<00:02:25.540> very<00:02:25.780> quiet<00:02:26.170> and

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
it works very well it's very quiet and

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.090 
it works very well it's very quiet and
it<00:02:27.100> does<00:02:27.280> very<00:02:27.579> well<00:02:27.790> for<00:02:27.850> this<00:02:28.209> g3<00:02:28.840> body<00:02:29.110> so<00:02:29.829> I

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
it does very well for this g3 body so I

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.920 
it does very well for this g3 body so I
would<00:02:30.250> definitely<00:02:30.640> recommend<00:02:30.760> this<00:02:31.150> palm<00:02:31.450> out

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
would definitely recommend this palm out

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.440 
would definitely recommend this palm out
to<00:02:32.530> anybody<00:02:32.860> looking<00:02:33.070> to<00:02:33.250> upgrade<00:02:33.489> their<00:02:33.940> g3

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
to anybody looking to upgrade their g3

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.650 
to anybody looking to upgrade their g3
or<00:02:34.480> if<00:02:34.750> they're<00:02:34.930> said<00:02:35.140> your<00:02:35.320> 5000<00:02:36.040> broker

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
or if they're said your 5000 broker

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.180
