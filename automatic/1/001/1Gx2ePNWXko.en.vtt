 take upside down position 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.240
 we start from the erect station with a lower limb protes limb lovers 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.010
 upper ones are high in line with the rest of the body through the support 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.080
 distance practically of the lower limb infants bust decreases 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.350
 maintaining the alignment with the upper limbs with the free lower limb 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.280

 consequently moving the shoulders forward but not too far in 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.780
 how much it doesn't need causes a fall of the upper limbs just the hands

 inferior come together when the art of momentum has reached the position 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.270
 upside down and at this point all the segments are in line with the head between 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.100
 arms 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.710
 as regards the study of the function of the vertical one wins with the

 these are the proportions as expected text 

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:22.429
 we should know how to do the vertical on three supports 

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:25.429
 that would be the vertical on the head that you see 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:28.259

 of hands and in any case can be useful for 

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:41.699
 the study of these verticals which is also called for you text today 

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:45.629
 The price list and the evolutions you said before are the ones mainly used 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.029
 difference artistic gymnastics

 vertical backwards 

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:05.369
 very amateur, other verticals that will improve

 video in 360 degrees rock 

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:11.779
 as far as teaching is concerned, general exercises can be done 

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:14.679
 in any case borne by superior cats 

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:17.509
 we work gaits 24 today 

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:21.649
 on 3 supports for tomorrow and one leg on two supports only on the hands 

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:26.109
 obviously to change the servant the body how to install a nonsense of 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:29.889
 180 degrees there are preparatory exercises already in order of 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:32.889
 difficulty to get to the vertical end. 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:37.630
 in this first exercise do not take a vertical position yet 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.400
 not square attitude those arms stretched out with legs outstretched 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.580
 Team position becuase of 90 degrees and very important not to arch the back 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.300
 for the duration of the exercise the shoulders are always pushed 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:54.140
 the upper limbs are stretched apogeo vb net of palms of the hands on the ground credit 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:57.139
 open and maintain this position as long as possible 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.950
 in this second exercise we carry more weight on the upper limbs 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.610
 always keep the body attitude in English if you look at the 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.640
 back always use a cliff wall 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.060
 this third exercise serves to maintain a greater balance 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:18.229
 verb to be performed both singularly and as a pair is executed in pairs of 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:21.549
 far systems puts one hand on the lumbar part of the back is a hand 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:22.610
 on the knees 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.190
 regarding chiesi group s exercise 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.360
 must maintain a contracted musculature the weight of the shoulders is reflected forward 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.360
 to the hands 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.960
 the tips of the feet, even if they are collected, however, look upwards 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:40.189
 in this last exercise we try to make the vertical momentum complete 

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:44.990
 we take the vertical position keeping the muscles contracted as possible 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.919
 and after that we let ourselves fall on a mattress keeping attitude 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:50.189
 correct 

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:54.199
 last year old exercises also present for learning to do the vertical - for 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:57.719
 always keep the recipe backlash position should never be born 

00:04:58.219 --> 00:05:01.599
 shoulders are always written in red look 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:03.029
 the look of today 

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:06.349
 must go slightly to the center and cast diamonds from your hands
