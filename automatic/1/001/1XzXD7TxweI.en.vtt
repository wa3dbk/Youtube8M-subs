00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 A good cooling is for every computer 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.700
 the a and o for an optimal 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.680
 Functionality hot 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.510
 summer days shows how good the 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.639
 specially designed cooling works 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.769
 or not eternal topic is 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.690
 here the use of below or above 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.760
 pressure and therefore welcome to 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.560
 another video is now likely 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.020
 the video topic is clear today it is 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.519
 to the pc cooling in terms of cpu cooler 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.199
 There is not much to say in the reason 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.840
 everything is better than the intel 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.460
 or amd boxset cooler if eu 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.570
 Water cooling and air cooling is 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.700
 often only a question of 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.469
 taste or the size of the budget 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.210
 there are enormous temperature differences 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.010
 rarely or rarely in planning and 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.809
 Implementation often raises questions 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.700
 such as how many fans 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.829
 I need how do I design one 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.960
 good he fled what is under or over 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.789
 pressure which fans are good i need 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.590
 a fan control the number of 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.020
 fan is dependent on the housing 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.090
 basic answer is optimal 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.890
 Two to three fans of this example 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.660
 Computer has space for two fans 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.550
 for such a standard configuration 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.649
 a fan at the front and a sufficient 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.719
 fan in the rear of the front fan takes over 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.610
 doing three tasks fresh air in the 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.229
 housing internal conveyors 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.000
 to cool storage media as well as the 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.680
 remaining hardware with cooler air too 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.360
 provide the rear fan 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.369
 Carries the warm air out of the housing 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.619
 but also ensures that the network 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.180
 an overly warm air sucks the air 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.250
 Housing bar is thus also one 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.990
 important point in the planning of the pc 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.580
 cool modern housing has been offering 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.560
 a few years the possibility that 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.119
 power supply to install in the housing floor 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.310
 whereby the power supply has its own 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.990
 Cooling cycle possesses optional would be one 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.030
 second fan in the housing friend 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.470
 or in the case cover the latter 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.060
 allows the use of the fireplace effect 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.950
 more about that right now 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.229
 overall, there is less 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.509
 is more simply put three fans 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.399
 but only bring air into the housing 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.320
 fan fears the warm air after 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.970
 outside the cool air warms up 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.950
 However , it creates a fan 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.030
 not the mass of a warm air after 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.950
 to move outside 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.270
 the logical consequence of this is it 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.340
 there is a heat accumulation 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.049
 how do i design a good airflow in 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.969
 Reference to the first question and its 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.200
 solution, this question is easy 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.479
 and answer quickly 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.030
 In principle, it has succeeded in one or 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.459
 Two lifts in the size front as well 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.379
 fan in the rear or in the cover fresh 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.600
 air is transported from outside to inside 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.000
 warm air outward 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.650
 back out what's under or over 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.630
 pressure basically says the 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.520
 chimney effect the warm air which one 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.800
 lower density possesses through openings 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.390
 in the upper side of the housing exits 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.160
 this is the origin of under 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.690
 pressure is a negative pressure when the 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.340
 Number of lonely fans less 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.810
 than this one is from jerking ventilation 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.720
 biggest advantage is a high cooling capacity 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.340
 and the amplification of the fireplace effect 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.380
 disadvantage without dust filter accumulates 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.750
 a lot of dust in the housing in contrast to it 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.520
 there is an overpressure when the number 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.290
 a caring fan is larger than 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.330
 the most powerful ones eject the fan 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.340
 Advantage less dust in the housing than 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.900
 also a good cooling performance is disadvantageous 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.700
 here the cancellation of the fireplace effect 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.740
 and the airflow is going through 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.600
 is principally determined air openings 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.520
 so if you are an uncompromising 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.350
 wants performance and generates a lot of heat 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.270
 you should really weigh carefully 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.220
 which way you want to go and which one 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.170
 housing then under circumstances best 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.620
 suitable for which are fans 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.360
 Well 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.760
 In principle, fans from the home offer 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.410
 noiseblocker be quite and problematic 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.060
 very good qualities but also 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.500
 services for use as 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.000
 housing fan with a list 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.650
 There are recommendations in the video 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.750
 description I need one 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.490
 fan control normally is one 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.470
 Fan control superfluous due 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.480
 its the current mainboards already 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.890
 offer a good fan control from the factory 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.200
 the advantage here is the 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.300
 Usage of the pwm technology 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.590
 as soon as the pc heats up turn 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.270
 the fans sink faster the faster 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.130
 temperature also decreases 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.180
 speed of the fans in the reason it was that 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.560
 again, and I hope so 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.840
 could you with this video at the 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.400
 help planning your pc cooling and a 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.960
 some useful information with you on the way 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.400
 give then thank you I tried 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.960
 see if they liked are the 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.520
 video but a thumb go up 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.500
 then impressions can fit as always 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.950
 good in the comment section in this 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.280
 senses 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.280
 pure skin
