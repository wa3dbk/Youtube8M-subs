widespread insurance fraud and mafia

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.560 
widespread insurance fraud and mafia
scam<00:00:37.559> so<00:00:37.829> in<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.280> weird<00:00:38.489> way<00:00:38.579> we<00:00:39.180> kind<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.450> have

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
scam so in a weird way we kind of have

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.060 
scam so in a weird way we kind of have
jerks<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.110> thank<00:00:40.350> for<00:00:40.530> all<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.739> this<00:00:40.829> wonderful
