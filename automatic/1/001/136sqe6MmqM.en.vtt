00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
a couple of other locations this one

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.619 
a couple of other locations this one
apparently<00:00:52.260> Surfers<00:00:53.010> Paradise<00:00:56.360> which<00:00:57.360> I

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
apparently Surfers Paradise which I

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.510 
apparently Surfers Paradise which I
can't<00:00:57.930> have<00:00:58.109> but<00:00:58.289> no<00:00:58.440> idea<00:00:58.829> where<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.190> if<00:00:59.399> we

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
can't have but no idea where it is if we

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.119 
can't have but no idea where it is if we
think<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.850> it<00:00:59.969> not<00:01:00.180> Trulia<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.140> don't<00:01:01.440> know<00:01:01.649> no

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
think is it not Trulia I don't know no

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.120 
think is it not Trulia I don't know no
idea<00:01:03.439> but<00:01:04.439> yeah<00:01:04.970> I<00:01:06.380> quite<00:01:07.380> like<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.979> first

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
idea but yeah I quite like it the first

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.190 
idea but yeah I quite like it the first
thing<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.520> notice<00:01:08.700> particularly<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:10.049> this

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
thing you notice particularly in this

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.260 
thing you notice particularly in this
race<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.650> you're<00:01:11.070> not<00:01:11.159> going<00:01:11.400> around

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
race is you're not going around

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.210 
race is you're not going around
one<00:01:13.270> of<00:01:13.390> the<00:01:13.480> oval<00:01:13.840> tracks<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:16.810> are<00:01:17.220> going

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
one of the oval tracks you are going

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.580 
one of the oval tracks you are going
around<00:01:18.430> or<00:01:18.790> he's<00:01:18.970> supposed<00:01:19.450> to<00:01:19.570> be<00:01:19.750> a<00:01:19.930> street

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
around or he's supposed to be a street

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.870 
around or he's supposed to be a street
circuit<00:01:21.160> and<00:01:22.410> and<00:01:23.410> yeah<00:01:24.340> he's<00:01:24.520> pretty<00:01:24.760> good

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
circuit and and yeah he's pretty good

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.060 
circuit and and yeah he's pretty good
fun<00:01:25.360> it's<00:01:25.600> very<00:01:25.690> very<00:01:26.290> difficult<00:01:26.560> where<00:01:27.040> I

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
fun it's very very difficult where I

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.600 
fun it's very very difficult where I
found<00:01:27.310> it<00:01:27.490> difficult<00:01:27.670> and<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:29.770> cars<00:01:30.040> tend<00:01:30.520> to

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
found it difficult and the cars tend to

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.120 
found it difficult and the cars tend to
vanish<00:01:31.300> off<00:01:31.480> into<00:01:31.810> the<00:01:31.930> distance<00:01:32.110> suspect<00:01:32.860> it

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
vanish off into the distance suspect it

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.740 
vanish off into the distance suspect it
doesn't<00:01:33.400> help<00:01:33.640> the<00:01:33.850> fact<00:01:33.880> that<00:01:34.120> the<00:01:34.300> control

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
doesn't help the fact that the control

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.470 
doesn't help the fact that the control
systems<00:01:35.230> slightly<00:01:35.710> weird<00:01:36.010> as<00:01:36.130> well<00:01:36.340> and<00:01:36.760> the

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 
systems slightly weird as well and the

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.480 
systems slightly weird as well and the
traditional<00:01:38.080> buttons<00:01:38.560> on<00:01:38.980> the<00:01:39.250> snez

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
traditional buttons on the snez

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.960 
traditional buttons on the snez
controller<00:01:40.030> that<00:01:40.270> you<00:01:40.420> would<00:01:40.540> think<00:01:40.750> would<00:01:40.960> be

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
controller that you would think would be

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.600 
controller that you would think would be
accelerate<00:01:42.970> and<00:01:43.150> brake<00:01:43.180> are<00:01:43.690> actually<00:01:44.140> not<00:01:44.610> he

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
accelerate and brake are actually not he

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.180 
accelerate and brake are actually not he
sees<00:01:45.940> the<00:01:46.360> mat-su<00:01:46.630> totally<00:01:47.410> different

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
sees the mat-su totally different

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.530 
sees the mat-su totally different
buttons<00:01:48.550> and<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:50.619> that<00:01:51.220> sort<00:01:51.520> of<00:01:52.060> didn't<00:01:52.420> make

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
buttons and and that sort of didn't make

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.240 
buttons and and that sort of didn't make
life<00:01:52.750> particularly<00:01:53.260> great<00:01:53.680> from<00:01:53.890> the<00:01:53.979> start

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
life particularly great from the start

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.010 
life particularly great from the start
as<00:01:54.369> you<00:01:54.460> saw<00:01:54.670> there<00:01:54.940> where<00:01:55.060> my<00:01:55.240> car<00:01:55.540> came<00:01:55.780> to<00:01:55.810> a

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
as you saw there where my car came to a

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.010 
as you saw there where my car came to a
grinding<00:01:56.320> halt<00:01:56.830> instead<00:01:57.340> of<00:01:57.460> flying<00:01:57.850> off<00:01:58.119> with

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
grinding halt instead of flying off with

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.340 
grinding halt instead of flying off with
the<00:01:59.140> rest<00:01:59.350> of<00:01:59.530> the<00:01:59.619> pack<00:01:59.830> and<00:02:00.869> yeah<00:02:01.869> if<00:02:02.200> you

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
the rest of the pack and yeah if you

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.850 
the rest of the pack and yeah if you
don't<00:02:03.060> make<00:02:04.060> it<00:02:04.420> with<00:02:05.080> the<00:02:05.229> rest<00:02:05.380> of<00:02:05.590> the<00:02:05.680> pack

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
don't make it with the rest of the pack

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.530 
don't make it with the rest of the pack
as<00:02:06.040> I've<00:02:06.220> found<00:02:06.520> out<00:02:06.700> in<00:02:06.880> this<00:02:07.060> race<00:02:07.300> in

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
as I've found out in this race in

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.090 
as I've found out in this race in
particular<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:09.310> tends<00:02:09.759> to<00:02:09.910> be<00:02:10.030> it<00:02:10.980> sends<00:02:11.980> me

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
particular that tends to be it sends me

this particular circuit which is and
a<00:02:32.190> kind<00:02:33.190> of<00:02:33.310> an<00:02:33.430> oval<00:02:33.730> circuit<00:02:34.300> is<00:02:34.390> not<00:02:34.540> a<00:02:34.600> pure

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
a kind of an oval circuit is not a pure

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.490 
a kind of an oval circuit is not a pure
oval<00:02:38.040> yeah<00:02:39.040> they<00:02:39.810> actually<00:02:40.810> managed<00:02:41.470> to

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
oval yeah they actually managed to

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.440 
oval yeah they actually managed to
remember<00:02:41.860> what<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:42.280> rifle<00:02:42.640> and<00:02:42.760> combination

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
remember what the rifle and combination

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.330 
remember what the rifle and combination
was<00:02:43.600> this<00:02:43.810> time<00:02:44.110> and<00:02:44.410> get<00:02:44.650> away<00:02:44.740> with<00:02:45.070> the<00:02:45.160> rest

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
was this time and get away with the rest

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.780 
was this time and get away with the rest
of<00:02:45.520> the<00:02:45.580> cars<00:02:45.820> which<00:02:46.630> was<00:02:46.870> quite<00:02:47.280> useful<00:02:48.280> in

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
of the cars which was quite useful in

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.790 
of the cars which was quite useful in
giving<00:02:49.180> you<00:02:49.450> a<00:02:49.480> bit<00:02:49.720> of<00:02:49.810> a<00:02:49.900> demonstration<00:02:50.500> of

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
giving you a bit of a demonstration of

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.260 
giving you a bit of a demonstration of
what<00:02:50.950> it's<00:02:51.100> like<00:02:51.190> to<00:02:51.340> race<00:02:51.670> with<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.090> other

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
what it's like to race with the other

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.400 
what it's like to race with the other
vehicles<00:02:52.720> on<00:02:53.020> the<00:02:53.140> track<00:02:53.410> and<00:02:54.360> it<00:02:55.360> is<00:02:56.050> very

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
vehicles on the track and it is very

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.070 
vehicles on the track and it is very
very<00:02:56.680> tough<00:02:57.070> and<00:02:57.760> I<00:02:58.060> certainly<00:02:58.480> found<00:02:58.720> it<00:02:58.930> very

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
very tough and I certainly found it very

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.460 
very tough and I certainly found it very

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
sorts of one-off races and one here and

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.490 
sorts of one-off races and one here and
well<00:03:30.670> it's<00:03:31.000> done<00:03:31.210> well<00:03:31.450> I<00:03:31.630> like<00:03:31.870> the<00:03:32.020> graphic<00:03:32.410> I

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
well it's done well I like the graphic I

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.190 
well it's done well I like the graphic I
do<00:03:32.650> like<00:03:32.890> these<00:03:33.160> this<00:03:34.030> graphical<00:03:34.630> style<00:03:35.730> and<00:03:37.200> I

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
do like these this graphical style and I

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.930 
do like these this graphical style and I
think<00:03:38.590> this<00:03:38.800> type<00:03:39.040> of<00:03:39.220> graphical<00:03:39.640> style

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
think this type of graphical style

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.110 
think this type of graphical style
certainly<00:03:40.240> suited<00:03:40.960> the<00:03:41.860> 16-bit<00:03:42.340> consoles

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
certainly suited the 16-bit consoles

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.270 
certainly suited the 16-bit consoles
certainly<00:03:43.990> a<00:03:44.020> lot<00:03:44.230> more<00:03:44.260> than<00:03:44.680> when<00:03:44.830> we<00:03:44.980> tried

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
certainly a lot more than when we tried

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.080 
certainly a lot more than when we tried
to<00:03:45.310> go<00:03:45.610> down<00:03:45.880> the<00:03:46.420> polygon<00:03:46.900> room<00:03:47.140> where<00:03:47.530> they

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
to go down the polygon room where they

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.940 
to go down the polygon room where they
they<00:03:49.090> really<00:03:49.360> did<00:03:49.660> struggle<00:03:49.900> I<00:03:50.320> mean<00:03:50.590> when<00:03:50.860> you

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
they really did struggle I mean when you

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.089 
they really did struggle I mean when you
compare<00:03:51.130> this<00:03:51.580> to<00:03:51.640> race<00:03:52.210> driving<00:03:52.630> for<00:03:53.020> example

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:54.099 
compare this to race driving for example

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.360 
compare this to race driving for example
and<00:03:54.459> without<00:03:55.359> on<00:03:55.840> the<00:03:56.140> supernintendo<00:03:56.590> anyway

chair and I was just having a nightmare
I<00:04:05.079> mean<00:04:05.230> some<00:04:05.889> people<00:04:06.189> a<00:04:06.249> person<00:04:06.730> comment

I mean some people a person comment

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.879 
I mean some people a person comment
section<00:04:07.510> that<00:04:07.629> was<00:04:07.810> the<00:04:08.019> reason<00:04:08.409> why<00:04:08.560> race

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:08.889 
section that was the reason why race

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:12.750 
section that was the reason why race
driving<00:04:09.389> was<00:04:10.389> markedly<00:04:10.840> slower<00:04:11.519> looking<00:04:12.519> than

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
driving was markedly slower looking than

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
our driving was a Mega Drive because the

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.479 
our driving was a Mega Drive because the
Mega<00:04:15.489> Drive<00:04:15.730> had<00:04:15.909> a<00:04:15.939> faster<00:04:16.419> processor<00:04:17.489> inside

Mega Drive had a faster processor inside
of<00:04:18.699> it<00:04:18.849> what<00:04:19.690> the<00:04:19.810> Super<00:04:20.139> Nintendo<00:04:20.259> relied<00:04:21.039> on

of it what the Super Nintendo relied on

of it what the Super Nintendo relied on
for<00:04:21.609> its<00:04:21.699> fancy<00:04:21.940> graphics<00:04:22.570> instead<00:04:22.810> of<00:04:23.050> flora

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.779 
and was rendered null and void really
when<00:04:28.840> he<00:04:28.870> came<00:04:29.139> to<00:04:29.199> shifting<00:04:29.919> polygons<00:04:30.430> around

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:30.789 
when he came to shifting polygons around

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:34.890 
when he came to shifting polygons around
and<00:04:32.099> he<00:04:33.099> can<00:04:33.310> see<00:04:33.550> now<00:04:33.580> why<00:04:34.000> Nintendo<00:04:34.300> did

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
and he can see now why Nintendo did

develop the special effects chip which

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:43.379 
develop the special effects chip which
really<00:04:39.430> enabled<00:04:39.970> them<00:04:40.380> soon<00:04:41.380> some<00:04:42.389> shift

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
really enabled them soon some shift

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.450 
really enabled them soon some shift
polygons<00:04:43.960> around<00:04:44.169> but<00:04:45.009> he's<00:04:45.099> kind<00:04:45.370> of

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
polygons around but he's kind of

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.830 
polygons around but he's kind of
interesting<00:04:45.970> to<00:04:46.150> think<00:04:46.180> that<00:04:46.419> there<00:04:46.630> were

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
interesting to think that there were

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.409 
interesting to think that there were
ways<00:04:47.259> of<00:04:47.650> remedying<00:04:48.430> problems<00:04:49.030> back<00:04:49.360> then

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
ways of remedying problems back then

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:52.140 
ways of remedying problems back then
because<00:04:50.080> games<00:04:50.979> the<00:04:51.160> cartridge<00:04:51.639> base<00:04:51.880> they

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.969 
because games the cartridge base they

actual<00:04:54.310> cartridge<00:04:54.849> themselves<00:04:55.660> in<00:04:56.560> order<00:04:57.009> to

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
actual cartridge themselves in order to

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.540 
actual cartridge themselves in order to
make<00:04:57.639> up<00:04:57.820> for<00:04:57.849> the<00:04:58.090> shortfalls<00:04:58.750> in<00:04:59.190> the<00:05:00.190> actual

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
make up for the shortfalls in the actual

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.460 
make up for the shortfalls in the actual
machine<00:05:00.759> hardware<00:05:01.210> I<00:05:01.599> mean<00:05:01.780> they<00:05:01.930> just<00:05:01.960> you

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
machine hardware I mean they just you

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.129 
machine hardware I mean they just you
can't<00:05:02.740> do<00:05:02.949> that<00:05:03.099> with<00:05:03.280> modern-day<00:05:03.610> consoles

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:06.139 
can't do that with modern-day consoles

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.499 
can't do that with modern-day consoles
there<00:05:06.800> you<00:05:07.009> know<00:05:07.129> what<00:05:07.699> the<00:05:07.849> console<00:05:08.300> is<00:05:08.479> that

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:08.509 
there you know what the console is that

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:10.839 
there you know what the console is that
ser<00:05:09.080> Kamini<00:05:09.499> stuck<00:05:09.800> with<00:05:09.949> her<00:05:10.069> architecture

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:10.849 
ser Kamini stuck with her architecture

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:13.480 
ser Kamini stuck with her architecture
and<00:05:11.629> until<00:05:12.110> they<00:05:12.229> bring<00:05:12.439> a<00:05:12.590> new<00:05:12.740> console<00:05:13.249> out

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
and until they bring a new console out

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.320 
and until they bring a new console out
and<00:05:14.120> so<00:05:15.020> it's<00:05:15.169> kind<00:05:15.379> of<00:05:15.469> interesting<00:05:15.800> to<00:05:16.330> to

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
and so it's kind of interesting to to

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.610 
and so it's kind of interesting to to
see<00:05:17.509> that<00:05:17.719> the<00:05:17.840> words<00:05:18.050> techniques<00:05:20.469> that<00:05:21.469> was

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
see that the words techniques that was

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.890 
see that the words techniques that was
available<00:05:21.889> to<00:05:22.430> developers<00:05:22.969> patterns<00:05:23.419> it's<00:05:23.719> a

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
available to developers patterns it's a

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.189 
available to developers patterns it's a
make<00:05:24.110> the<00:05:24.469> most<00:05:25.009> out<00:05:25.279> of<00:05:25.340> a<00:05:25.639> game<00:05:25.900> but<00:05:26.900> anyway

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 
make the most out of a game but anyway

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:31.689 
make the most out of a game but anyway
and<00:05:27.789> this<00:05:28.789> has<00:05:28.999> been<00:05:29.889> Nigel<00:05:30.889> Mansell<00:05:31.249> in<00:05:31.340> Dakar

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:31.699 
and this has been Nigel Mansell in Dakar

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:33.189 
and this has been Nigel Mansell in Dakar
