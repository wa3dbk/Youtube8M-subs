streak you have to put different

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.459 
streak you have to put different
attachments<00:00:50.879> or<00:00:50.969> modules<00:00:51.449> on<00:00:51.690> them<00:00:51.960> for

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
imagine that with no modules it's a

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.380 
imagine that with no modules it's a
pretty<00:00:56.309> bad<00:00:56.550> streak<00:00:56.879> but<00:00:56.910> if<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.180> put

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
pretty bad streak but if you put

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
different ones on it it's a could be one

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.220 
different ones on it it's a could be one
of<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.030> best<00:01:00.239> weeks<00:01:00.480> in<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.660> game<00:01:00.809> just<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.170> day

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
but with most of the streaks in this

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.149 
but with most of the streaks in this
game<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.540> have<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.750> put<00:01:07.140> your<00:01:07.320> force<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.890> put

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
game you have to put your force to put

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.490 
game you have to put your force to put
different<00:01:09.060> modules<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.900> make<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.290> good

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
different modules to make it a good

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.679 
different modules to make it a good
streak<00:01:10.830> that's<00:01:11.040> why<00:01:11.400> i<00:01:11.820> put<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.360> streaks

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
streak that's why i put the streaks

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:13.940 
streak that's why i put the streaks
that's<00:01:12.930> number<00:01:13.110> five<00:01:13.290> here<00:01:13.590> on<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.740> list

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
that's number five here on the list

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.520 
that's number five here on the list
because<00:01:14.280> with<00:01:14.909> past<00:01:15.180> cause<00:01:15.509> for<00:01:15.900> example<00:01:16.350> with

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
because with past cause for example with

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.920 
because with past cause for example with
the<00:01:16.740> sentry<00:01:17.130> gun<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.490> black<00:01:17.670> ops<00:01:17.909> 2<00:01:18.150> if<00:01:18.540> you

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
the sentry gun and black ops 2 if you

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.399 
the sentry gun and black ops 2 if you
put<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.350> down<00:01:19.619> it's<00:01:20.180> automatically<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.600> but

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
put that down it's automatically a I but

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.469 
put that down it's automatically a I but
if<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.650> want<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:23.070> AAA<00:01:23.549> sentry<00:01:24.030> gun<00:01:24.240> on<00:01:24.330> this

attachment which I don't think that you
should<00:01:29.070> do<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.430> think<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.880> should

automatically be AI but that's the
problem<00:01:32.790> with<00:01:32.970> this<00:01:33.090> game<00:01:33.360> just<00:01:33.689> do<00:01:33.840> score

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140

Zeus you have to put different modules
on<00:01:37.259> them<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.710> act<00:01:37.860> like<00:01:37.979> previous<00:01:38.369> score

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
on them to act like previous score

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.520 
on them to act like previous score
streaks<00:01:39.150> in<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.479> past<00:01:39.840> college<00:01:40.290> like<00:01:40.409> with

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
streaks in the past college like with

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.710 
streaks in the past college like with
the<00:01:40.619> UAV<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.490> have<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.700> put<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:41.909> Scrambler<00:01:42.509> to

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
the UAV you have to put the Scrambler to

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.690 
the UAV you have to put the Scrambler to
make<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:42.990> like<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> counter<00:01:43.829> UAV<00:01:43.979> from

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
make it like a counter UAV from

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.700 
make it like a counter UAV from
passcodes<00:01:45.270> as<00:01:45.479> we<00:01:45.689> all<00:01:45.810> know<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:46.350> that's<00:01:46.560> the

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
passcodes as we all know so that's the

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.340 
passcodes as we all know so that's the
number<00:01:46.860> five<00:01:47.130> just<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.970> score<00:01:48.240> streaks<00:01:48.659> so

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
number five just to score streaks so

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.170 
number five just to score streaks so
coming<00:01:49.829> up<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.100> number<00:01:50.310> four<00:01:50.490> spot<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:51.030> is

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
coming up the number four spot it is

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.270 
coming up the number four spot it is
young<00:01:51.509> so<00:01:51.780> sue<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.259> most<00:01:52.530> people<00:01:52.770> stop

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
game because of the new movie system

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.120 
game because of the new movie system
because<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.110> can<00:01:58.229> like<00:01:58.350> double<00:01:58.740> jump<00:01:58.950> in

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
because you can like double jump in

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.280 
because you can like double jump in
previous<00:01:59.790> cause<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.299> course<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:01.020> couldn't

previous cause of course you couldn't

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.350 
previous cause of course you couldn't
double<00:02:01.680> jump<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:02.009> could<00:02:02.280> not<00:02:02.520> go<00:02:02.820> this<00:02:03.060> high

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
double jump you could not go this high

lots of people out there that's the

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.869 
lots of people out there that's the

at<00:02:18.030> all<00:02:18.120> if<00:02:18.540> this<00:02:18.870> was<00:02:19.079> like<00:02:19.319> ghost<00:02:19.650> could<00:02:20.099> you

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
at all if this was like ghost could you

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.190 
at all if this was like ghost could you
do<00:02:20.489> that<00:02:20.700> if<00:02:20.909> that<00:02:21.030> was<00:02:21.209> black<00:02:21.450> ops<00:02:21.689> 2<00:02:21.959> could

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
do that if that was black ops 2 could

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.740 
do that if that was black ops 2 could
you<00:02:22.379> like<00:02:22.560> jump<00:02:23.250> off<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.849> ledge<00:02:23.879> and<00:02:24.329> just<00:02:24.510> go

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
you like jump off the ledge and just go

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.300 
you like jump off the ledge and just go
and<00:02:24.989> jump<00:02:25.319> in<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.500> glass<00:02:25.799> like<00:02:26.040> it's<00:02:26.189> a

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
and jump in the glass like it's a

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.670 
and jump in the glass like it's a
Hollywood<00:02:26.760> movie<00:02:26.790> no<00:02:27.299> you<00:02:27.329> could<00:02:27.930> not<00:02:28.230> so

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
Hollywood movie no you could not so

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.009 
Hollywood movie no you could not so
that's<00:02:29.340> just<00:02:29.489> one<00:02:29.700> thing<00:02:29.849> the<00:02:30.239> exosuits<00:02:30.870> to

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
that's just one thing the exosuits to

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.360 
that's just one thing the exosuits to
really<00:02:31.260> break<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.680> mold<00:02:31.920> there<00:02:32.129> and<00:02:32.250> that

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
really break the mold there and that

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.490 
really break the mold there and that
really<00:02:32.640> just<00:02:32.879> breaks<00:02:33.659> the<00:02:33.840> tradition<00:02:34.349> of

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
really just breaks the tradition of

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.530 
really just breaks the tradition of
boots<00:02:34.890> on<00:02:35.129> the<00:02:35.250> ground<00:02:35.280> because<00:02:35.730> this<00:02:36.209> is<00:02:36.390> not

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
boots on the ground because this is not

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.050 
boots on the ground because this is not
boots<00:02:36.900> on<00:02:37.049> the<00:02:37.140> ground<00:02:37.170> this<00:02:37.620> is<00:02:37.890> boots<00:02:38.250> in<00:02:38.579> the

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
boots on the ground this is boots in the

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.170 
boots on the ground this is boots in the
air<00:02:39.239> so<00:02:39.510> that's<00:02:39.690> number<00:02:39.810> four<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.409> exosuit<00:02:41.180> so

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
air so that's number four the exosuit so

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.940 
air so that's number four the exosuit so
coming<00:02:42.629> up<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.840> number<00:02:43.049> three<00:02:43.290> spot<00:02:43.439> it<00:02:43.829> is

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
coming up the number three spot it is

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.190 
coming up the number three spot it is
weapon<00:02:44.400> variance<00:02:44.879> and<00:02:45.180> sometimes<00:02:45.659> they<00:02:45.900> can't

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
weapon variance and sometimes they can't

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.589 
weapon variance and sometimes they can't
determine<00:02:46.530> a<00:02:46.739> gunfight<00:02:47.220> like<00:02:47.370> for<00:02:47.609> example<00:02:47.700> if

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
determine a gunfight like for example if

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.660 
determine a gunfight like for example if
a<00:02:48.750> guy<00:02:48.900> has<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.530> NP<00:02:49.859> them<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:50.190> Goliath<00:02:50.640> and

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
a guy has the NP them and Goliath and

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.930 
a guy has the NP them and Goliath and
you<00:02:50.940> have<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.390> base<00:02:51.659> and<00:02:51.989> p11<00:02:52.829> the<00:02:53.280> Goliath<00:02:53.790> is

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
you have the base and p11 the Goliath is

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.970 
you have the base and p11 the Goliath is
most<00:02:54.180> likely<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:54.750> win<00:02:54.900> because<00:02:55.049> it<00:02:55.530> is<00:02:55.680> a

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
most likely to win because it is a

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.490 
most likely to win because it is a
better<00:02:56.519> weapon<00:02:56.970> it's<00:02:57.510> a<00:02:58.049> better<00:02:58.260> weapon

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
better weapon it's a better weapon

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.619 
better weapon it's a better weapon
variant<00:02:58.950> than<00:02:59.099> you<00:02:59.340> so<00:02:59.579> basically<00:03:00.060> that<00:03:00.090> guy

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
variant than you so basically that guy

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.690 
variant than you so basically that guy
has<00:03:01.139> the<00:03:01.530> better<00:03:01.799> weapon<00:03:02.280> than<00:03:02.310> you<00:03:02.519> like

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
has the better weapon than you like

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.699 
has the better weapon than you like
literally<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.480> better<00:03:03.750> weapon<00:03:04.139> than<00:03:04.170> you<00:03:04.440> and

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
literally the better weapon than you and

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.830 
literally the better weapon than you and
I<00:03:05.099> just<00:03:05.310> honestly<00:03:05.579> I<00:03:05.819> don't<00:03:05.879> like<00:03:06.480> that<00:03:06.510> at<00:03:06.750> all

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
I just honestly I don't like that at all

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.020 
I just honestly I don't like that at all
because<00:03:07.049> weapon<00:03:07.620> branch<00:03:07.980> do<00:03:08.489> you<00:03:08.549> determine<00:03:08.819> a

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
because weapon branch do you determine a

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.819 
because weapon branch do you determine a
gunfight<00:03:09.480> least<00:03:10.139> just<00:03:10.500> some<00:03:10.680> my<00:03:10.799> opinion

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
gunfight least just some my opinion

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.430
