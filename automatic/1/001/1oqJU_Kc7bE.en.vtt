 thousands of arizona residents but 17 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.110
 years after what happened is still 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.869
 a mystery the official explanation of 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:32.350
 US Army says that the 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:34.869
 lights were flares of their planes without 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.080
 However, the then governor of 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:41.290
 state of arizona files emington third 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.500
 he said later in an interview I am 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:47.110
 pilot and I know what kind of devices are 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.410
 almost all flying devices 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:53.020
 I can definitely say that this 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.390
 artifact did not look like any 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.440
 object made by the man who had 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.020
 Never seen 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.450
 and this is certainly not reflections to great 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.930
 height because the reflections do not fly in 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:09.200
 formation and added is still a great 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:12.130
 mystery other people saw it
