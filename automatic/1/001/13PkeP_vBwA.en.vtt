00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.389 
very are very frustrating the way they
decide<00:02:06.760> to<00:02:06.880> tell<00:02:07.060> you<00:02:07.150> to<00:02:07.240> go<00:02:07.390> somewhere<00:02:07.810> I

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
decide to tell you to go somewhere I

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.440 
decide to tell you to go somewhere I
mean<00:02:09.399> you<00:02:09.550> should<00:02:09.700> always<00:02:09.789> really<00:02:10.090> check<00:02:10.300> your

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
mean you should always really check your

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.880 
mean you should always really check your
map<00:02:10.660> to<00:02:10.899> be<00:02:11.020> safe<00:02:11.320> but<00:02:11.680> there's<00:02:12.340> a<00:02:12.430> few<00:02:12.640> times

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
map to be safe but there's a few times

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.650 
map to be safe but there's a few times
where<00:02:14.890> it's<00:02:15.070> told<00:02:15.370> me<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:15.910> completely<00:02:16.480> wrong

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
where it's told me the completely wrong

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.680 
where it's told me the completely wrong
direction<00:02:16.690> and<00:02:17.640> then<00:02:18.640> it'll<00:02:18.820> shut<00:02:19.510> you<00:02:19.630> know

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
direction and then it'll shut you know

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.630 
direction and then it'll shut you know
eventually<00:02:20.560> correct<00:02:21.010> itself<00:02:21.280> and<00:02:21.490> I'll<00:02:21.550> be

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
eventually correct itself and I'll be

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.980 
eventually correct itself and I'll be
like<00:02:21.760> Harry<00:02:21.910> why<00:02:22.180> are<00:02:22.480> you<00:02:22.570> going<00:02:22.660> this<00:02:22.840> way

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
like Harry why are you going this way

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.880 
like Harry why are you going this way
you<00:02:23.110> should<00:02:23.140> be<00:02:23.320> going<00:02:23.500> that<00:02:23.590> way<00:02:23.709> and<00:02:23.740> I'm

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
you should be going that way and I'm

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.040 
you should be going that way and I'm
like<00:02:24.010> that's<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:25.060> way<00:02:25.209> I<00:02:25.240> was<00:02:25.510> going<00:02:25.630> and<00:02:25.930> then

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
like that's the way I was going and then

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.920 
like that's the way I was going and then
you<00:02:26.080> told<00:02:26.230> me<00:02:26.380> to<00:02:26.470> go<00:02:26.530> this<00:02:26.709> way<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:30.720> it's<00:02:31.720> very

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
you told me to go this way and it's very

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.350 
you told me to go this way and it's very
random<00:02:32.250> with<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.370> waypoints<00:02:33.880> too<00:02:34.030> or<00:02:34.209> with

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
random with the waypoints too or with

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.780 
random with the waypoints too or with
the<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:34.810> trail<00:02:35.190> I'm<00:02:36.190> supposed<00:02:36.459> to<00:02:36.520> follow

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
the the trail I'm supposed to follow

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.729 
the the trail I'm supposed to follow
sometimes<00:02:37.330> it'll<00:02:37.750> just<00:02:37.959> lead<00:02:38.500> you<00:02:38.709> through

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
sometimes it'll just lead you through

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.949 
sometimes it'll just lead you through
the<00:02:39.040> weirdest<00:02:39.670> like<00:02:40.090> sections<00:02:40.630> like<00:02:40.750> there's

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
the weirdest like sections like there's

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.420 
the weirdest like sections like there's
like<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.350> pathway<00:02:41.830> you'll<00:02:42.040> see<00:02:42.160> you<00:02:42.250> like<00:02:42.340> oh
