figure dipping them in paint and then
using<00:01:22.340> them<00:01:22.459> like<00:01:22.490> a<00:01:22.610> pen<00:01:22.970> it's<00:01:23.720> softer<00:01:24.649> than<00:01:24.679> a

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
using them like a pen it's softer than a

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.859 
using them like a pen it's softer than a
toothpick<00:01:25.369> so<00:01:25.610> it<00:01:25.700> doesn't<00:01:26.000> leave<00:01:26.209> that

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
toothpick so it doesn't leave that

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:28.870 
toothpick so it doesn't leave that
little<00:01:27.110> line<00:01:27.470> in<00:01:27.500> the<00:01:27.709> middle<00:01:28.009> and<00:01:28.190> it's

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
little line in the middle and it's

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.669 
little line in the middle and it's
stiffer<00:01:29.420> than<00:01:29.569> a<00:01:29.660> brush<00:01:29.899> so<00:01:30.259> it<00:01:30.380> doesn't<00:01:30.619> get

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:30.679 
stiffer than a brush so it doesn't get

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:33.040 
stiffer than a brush so it doesn't get
too<00:01:30.860> wide<00:01:31.660> yeah

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
the head doesn't turn anymore because

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.349 
the head doesn't turn anymore because
the<00:03:08.209> her<00:03:09.079> hair<00:03:09.349> kind<00:03:09.769> of<00:03:09.919> is<00:03:10.159> right<00:03:10.819> up<00:03:11.000> against

the her hair kind of is right up against
her<00:03:11.389> shoulders<00:03:11.930> so<00:03:11.959> there's<00:03:12.349> no<00:03:12.470> clearance

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
her shoulders so there's no clearance

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.580 
her shoulders so there's no clearance

for her head to turn but the rests of

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.819 
for her head to turn but the rests of
the<00:03:15.650> wave<00:03:15.919> body<00:03:16.280> is<00:03:16.519> pretty<00:03:16.760> unrestricted

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
the wave body is pretty unrestricted

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.020 
the wave body is pretty unrestricted
shoulders<00:03:18.829> look<00:03:18.980> a<00:03:19.040> little<00:03:19.189> bit<00:03:19.370> wide<00:03:19.609> but

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
shoulders look a little bit wide but

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.699 
shoulders look a little bit wide but
again<00:03:20.269> that's<00:03:20.540> just<00:03:20.629> a<00:03:20.780> consequence<00:03:21.260> of<00:03:21.500> the

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
again that's just a consequence of the

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.119
