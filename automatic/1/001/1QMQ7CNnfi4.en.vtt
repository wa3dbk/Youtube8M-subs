00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.500
 is 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.000
 hi everyone is fabien for 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:31.950
 and out of fate of the sandwich oct en 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.720
 combi I'm sure and certain that you 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.010
 dream all out of this map but 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.239
 unfortunately because of the debts 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.470
 barrier is impossible 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.410
 Well, I present you today 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.420
 with a mode posted by email a magnifying glass 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.680
 that I thank again so it was 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.030
 frankly the galley to film 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.430
 since once in a part in 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.480
 online zombies you have three minutes 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.059
 to do what you want to do 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.519
 do and then well the host is banned 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.869
 and it disconnects you from the game so 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:56.699
 there I show you a huge barrier 

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:58.470
 certainly has the highest of the 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.720
 late then then simply offered 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.309
 a job outside the map so well 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.159
 obviously it's impossible to do it 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.150
 in normal times since you will die to 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.630
 because of the debt barriers all 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.130
 simply 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.590
 so there you see that I honestly 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.049
 had a huge chance to get out 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.580
 of the card from the beginning I was fine 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.800
 learned I did the jump where needed 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.440
 and then 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.030
 I little explored the height map thing that 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.680
 I wanted to do you and introduced you 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.570
 so for this christmas eve 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.520
 Besides, I take this opportunity for you 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.780
 wish a merry Christmas to all I hope 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.390
 that it will be good for all 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.040
 world and then here is where you can 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.780
 see that the pitch no night etc 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.640
 and still beautiful so never 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.100
 could realize in real online without 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.150
 fashion it would be really great so 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.170
 here are the friends I hope it's 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.620
 finger you will have pleased me I tell you to 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.190
 very soon 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.190
 by everyone 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.010
