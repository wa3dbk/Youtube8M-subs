00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.860
 for this type of products as they can 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.050

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.780
 true that this one has sent us quite 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.710
 of her and we are very happy 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.530

 gentlemen for anyone who asks 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.220
 the same time this is one of the 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.990
 requirements of which one is 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.050
 commits when it receives products from 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.730
 these companies thank God this the 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.610
 channel has been growing quite a bit and 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.350
 We can not allow asking for covers to 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.930
 the companies and they are true that you 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.850
 they ask to send them then we are going to take 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.150
 this is a slipped style case and the 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:23.120
 price as you can see is 29 dollars 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.160
 with 95 cents for the ipod touch a 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.770
 Sliding style case we are going to 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.570
 try to get it out here and these are already 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.510
 we are going to proceed to vote 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.159
 and let's take a look at what it is 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.870
 the sheath itself and as you can see it extracts 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.850
 a little candy in this case 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.130
 it would be nothing more than a screen saver 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.690
 which is always good since this is 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.700
 very good to have protected the screen of 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.619
 our devices with this kind of 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.150
 products are we proceed to put it to a 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.180
 side and here is what is the case in 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.280
 yes it is a sliding style cover or 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.990
 slider case as you can see in the part 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.630
 from below here it brings like a small cloth 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.940
 very but very fine the truth that very 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.890
 soft touch which allows you to 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.780
 avoid scratching the part 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.789
 from behind our ipod touch a case 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.640
 totally plastic and the part of here 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.950
 can see is color as purple in the 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.440
 camera will appear blue type something like that but 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.390
 it is purple color the bottom part 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.090
 also brings what is this little of this 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.739
 piece here of fabric which is going to 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.570
 prevent us from having scratches and also 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.340
 totally plastic we will proceed to 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.900
 install friends many times when 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.790
 our team already has protectors 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.500
 screen makes these covers that 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.840
 too tight but look 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.610
 it simply slides in this way in 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.850
 this moment is not the case that is very 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.430
 tight what is the sleeve or 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.710
 on the phone itself and we proceed to 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.680
 put what is the bottom part up 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.240
 that is totally connected and already as 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.010
 you can see it is fully installed what 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.390
 what is this cover in the part of 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.740
 forward as you can see it has design 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.780
 screen on the table in which we 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.280
 lets have our phone sorry 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.750
 our ipod touch in this case mouth 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.280
 down without any problems or 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.870
 concerns that can be reached 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.150
 scratch what is our screen in the 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.860
 back a hole for what it is 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.110
 the camera and the microphone of what it is 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.330
 our ipod touch is very, very, very 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.800
 to the center the truth that the cuts are 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.390
 excellent in the upper part a 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.000
 cut and open for what is the button 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.550
 off and on and the truth that 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.370
 it has a little bit of cut right down 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.890
 to be able to allow this to use it and 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.330
 put it at the time of lighting not without 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.460
 no kind of problems we can access 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.780
 to that button on the part of the other of what 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.700
 which is a game also for what they are 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.740
 the two volume buttons and the truth 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.810
 which it is very, very easy to 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.210
 time to use it since it does not interfere 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.890
 for nothing the case when we want 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.630
 lower or increase the volume of our ipod 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.340
 touch in the bottom part a cut 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.860
 complete for what it is 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.200
 the speaker or the right speaker door 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.940
 30 pins and the hole to connect 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.420
 what are our hearing aids the case 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.349
 it's at $ 29 with 95 cents 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.209
 they only include a protector 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.489
 screens or should I say it's a bit 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:56.670
 Many other companies offer this 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.980
 same case for 20 to 24 dollars or me 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.290
 I think that a little bit of an exaggeration 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.299
 but hey there is for the tastes the 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.879
 colors I would say the saying here you can see 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:08.069
