00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:09.179
 In addition to Warhammer figures there are many 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.820
 any small things that help improve 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.429
 the game and makes it more beautiful but there is a whole 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.520
 a box with such trifles that I'm all 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.279
 time I carry with me to the games and today I 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.670
 I want to tell you first about the very 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.590
 box this box language as you can see on 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.960
 four riders symbol not stuck 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.240
 apocalypse on your own you can stick 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.230
 something more childish some 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.040
 terminator 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.739
 well, or at worst, a woman bare remember 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.219
 as a child lie down panties on yuan 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.680
 they are lost this box is good because 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.780
 she is firstly roomy secondly 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.570
 transparent you can see what is in it and where it lies 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.570
 the blues she is very cool opens 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.640
 and finally there are three branches here and you can 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.100
 all neatly but now 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.239
 content and start probably from the very 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.670
 obvious first of all templates 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:08.580
 secondly I have cubes for three 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.909
 packs of basic cubes i use them for 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.790
 most of the throws and 2 box 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.220
 symbols of the four horsemen of the apocalypse 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.020
 here are the cubes for a flamethrower or khorn a 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.729
 also for tzincha 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.210
 well, it's logical to burn with a flamethrower 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.909
 red cubes and 3 boxes cubes for 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.939
 nurgla as well as this box which is like 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.790
 it would be very convenient to mark the current 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.520
 move and the elephants of the Swedish dice I have 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.170
 simply not because models with this 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.049
 I do not play stamps 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.570
 Well, of course, gentleman's tape measure 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.759
 set that should have with you 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.820
 Each Hammer station Well, after that go 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.729
 not such mandatory things on top of us 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.040
 markers lie in the river of this technology just 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.149
 you put it on a broken market or there 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.540
 land raider 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.910
 I now ask where I got them and 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.210
 the only answer to all questions 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.730
 of this type 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.280
 ebay.com before calculating said by itself 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.200
 smoke markers to display 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.480
 use smog launcher but since 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.280
 now the launcher could not play this me 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.830
 lying on the shelf 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.960
 plus these are the small markers of all kinds 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.240
 negative effects i basically 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.760
 I display and my soul blade you put to 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.890
 enemy detachment on you present 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.300
 and at the end of the turn he reminds you that 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.760
 actually need to throw 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.770
 this same salt lake also lay here 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.050
 new markers have now appeared 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.900
 mysterious pc object every point can 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.270
 make some kind of useful or dangerous 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.190
 its effect is easy to remember if 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.959
 put the die in the appropriate number 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.900
 there is a special cube here 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.250
 podstavchka well and finally lies here 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.470
 my d 20 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.290
 i use to randomize 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.420
 strike vector victims in large squads 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.630
 and we come to the last branch 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:02.190
 here are two craters the size of a market 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:04.350
 yes debate debate notepad I 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.200
 I write here world trade and was it 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.050
 the night of the first move before hygiene and sawing 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.860
 or for example gifty for the demons of chaos here 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.860
 of course 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:17.250
 and a pen to record it 6 playing 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.950
 maps you ask me why you see the map 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:24.209
 whether they are for a mission with a root here just 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.500
 two twos two triples 1 four and 1 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.320
 unit 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.239
 Stir your deck on giving your opponent 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.330
 hook after this throw 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:36.510
 the cost of each point in my opinion is 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:39.030
 the most convenient way to do it well and 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.190
 finally welded my old lenses 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.680
 they are certainly prettier but less 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.910
 practical than this cube stand here 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:50.820
 much more convenient than keeping his ducks 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.769
 constantly random take away from here well 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.200
 and here is such a container as me 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.390
 relays to here are actually all some 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.790
 little things of it are simply necessary 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.280
 some useful and convenient 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.470
 and which is just for beauty with such 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.989
 the box is convenient to go to tournaments always 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.319
 everything is at hand and in one place I hope 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:12.450
 I'll give you a good one and 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.450
 and thank you for seeing ya
