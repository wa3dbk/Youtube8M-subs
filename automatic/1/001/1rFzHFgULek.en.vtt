 I'm tired I can not even really 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.540
 It's a very simple job. 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.320
 but due to the fact that we are so accustomed 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.240
 understand us so taught us habitually 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.830
 lie on the couch and rest is nothing 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.350
 do go to work without understanding 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.090
 the meaning of this work is not to think about 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.519
 his future and upset 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.320

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.879
 rushing through life just mad speed 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.390

 annual income which is calculated 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.590
 millions and millions you think 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.230
 first person network marketing 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.220

 six hundred dollars a month 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.750

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.000

 unreal it is impossible my friends this 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:40.540
 the fact and the fact that it doesn't fit in 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:44.500
 his little head doesnâ€™t mean that 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.660
 this does not exist it is a fact you can 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.940
 imagine physically imagine that 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.010
 is the speed of light or at least 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:55.680
 the speed of sound from which the military fly 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:58.209
 airplanes are very difficult but it exists 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.590
 can you imagine that when you 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.320
 get on a plane and fly 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.350
 somewhere in another city you move 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.600
 by air at a speed of about 800 kilometers 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.459
 at one o'clock here's a visual can all 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.799
 who presented flying the plane from the shell 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.269
 let's not imagine a chair that's transparent 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:16.209
 a plane like this how it should look 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.950
 it is possible to imagine it well, I'm easier for you 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.410
 ask a question when you press a key 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.450
 and turn on the lights in your room you 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.420
 can you imagine how it all 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.640
 happens or when you take the remote from 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.510
 TV turn on the TV click 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.049
 hundreds of channels 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.579
 notice 20 years ago it was not 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.280
 2-3 channels and all 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:37.670
 a man whose home was ntv was considered 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.459
 cool guy 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.489
 it was a rich man channel today 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.680
 have everyone you can imagine how 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.810
 it works no but you just take and 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.760
 use the same network 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.610
 marketing you don't have to understand 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.530
 how it works you need to know what you 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.410
 you need to regularly press a button 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.800
 invitation you need to press regularly 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.690
 on a personal meeting button 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.310
 you need to regularly do certain 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.230
 actions that are absolutely certain 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.450
 will lead you to the result can say 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.550
 how can i be sure it's the same 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.739
 that take the remote from the TV press 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.260
 button to the club to turn it on and 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:18.019
 you will not sure whether it will turn on or not 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.060
 no of course there is a possibility in the remote 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.310
 the batteries are gone the TV is not connected to 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.139
 electrical networks and so on and so forth what 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.139
 It may not turn on but it always 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:29.840
 There is a reasonable reason that you immediately 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:31.880
 can eliminate and the maximum that you 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.350
 you may need to take it go 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.850
 to the store and buy batteries for the remote 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.180
 because you don't have them at home 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.169
 but it is not difficult here I am trying to you 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.450
 explain what is in network marketing 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.700
 succeeding is just as easy as 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:46.280
 turn on the TV you just need to understand 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.620
 rule the first rule I told you this 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.870
 compiling a list of names and his 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.030
 monthly revision perez leave your 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.030
 list of names start screaming 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.860
 again as soon as this video ends 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.900
 sit right away don't delay in the farthest 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.130
 box and generally stop anything 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.940
 put off because life is very 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.940
 short piece
