00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.160 
and shamans you know it's interesting
because<00:01:38.000> when<00:01:38.360> you<00:01:38.390> were<00:01:38.600> on<00:01:38.750> the<00:01:38.780> show<00:01:39.020> before

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
because when you were on the show before

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.680 
because when you were on the show before
we<00:01:39.770> talked<00:01:40.040> a<00:01:40.190> lot<00:01:40.340> about<00:01:40.550> energy<00:01:41.240> medicine

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
we talked a lot about energy medicine

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.450 
we talked a lot about energy medicine
very<00:01:42.140> quickly<00:01:42.350> for<00:01:42.620> our<00:01:42.650> audience<00:01:43.070> what<00:01:43.310> is

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
very quickly for our audience what is

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.120 
very quickly for our audience what is
energy<00:01:43.760> medicine<00:01:44.420> well<00:01:44.810> energy<00:01:45.350> is<00:01:45.590> medicine

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
energy medicine well energy is medicine

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.800 
energy medicine well energy is medicine
you<00:01:46.400> know<00:01:46.490> we're<00:01:46.670> surrounded<00:01:47.060> by<00:01:47.360> a<00:01:47.480> sea<00:01:47.780> of

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
you know we're surrounded by a sea of

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.720 
you know we're surrounded by a sea of
energy<00:01:48.050> and<00:01:48.470> then<00:01:48.590> think<00:01:48.830> there's<00:01:49.100> infrared

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:49.730 
energy and then think there's infrared

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.210 
energy and then think there's infrared
there's<00:01:50.060> cosmic<00:01:50.660> energy<00:01:51.110> there's<00:01:51.470> microwave

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
there's cosmic energy there's microwave

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.790 
there's cosmic energy there's microwave
well<00:01:53.060> there's<00:01:53.330> another<00:01:53.570> energy<00:01:54.110> that<00:01:54.500> just

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
well there's another energy that just

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.190 
well there's another energy that just
surrounds<00:01:55.790> us<00:01:55.910> and<00:01:56.060> penetrates<00:01:56.150> us<00:01:56.780> and<00:01:57.020> can

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
surrounds us and penetrates us and can

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.370 
surrounds us and penetrates us and can
be<00:01:57.350> used<00:01:57.680> as<00:01:58.370> a<00:01:58.430> as<00:01:58.880> a<00:01:59.300> way<00:01:59.480> of<00:01:59.510> healing<00:01:59.750> right

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
be used as a as a way of healing right

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.860 
be used as a as a way of healing right
and<00:02:00.650> so<00:02:00.860> why<00:02:01.070> is<00:02:01.130> energy<00:02:01.580> medicine<00:02:01.700> so<00:02:02.600> so

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
and so why is energy medicine so so

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.150 
and so why is energy medicine so so
important<00:02:03.260> doesn't<00:02:03.440> does<00:02:03.650> that<00:02:03.800> help<00:02:04.010> the

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
important doesn't does that help the

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.190 
important doesn't does that help the
body<00:02:04.190> does<00:02:04.700> it<00:02:04.850> by<00:02:05.180> getting<00:02:05.630> rid<00:02:05.750> of<00:02:05.870> a<00:02:05.930> lot<00:02:06.050> of

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
you know something that happened when we

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.280 
you know something that happened when we
were<00:02:18.060> children<00:02:18.270> and<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.840> next<00:02:18.960> thing<00:02:19.200> you

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
well at that point energy medicine can

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.630 
well at that point energy medicine can
really<00:02:24.570> uncover<00:02:25.020> that<00:02:25.230> original<00:02:25.740> wound<00:02:25.980> and

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
help you clear it so that when you have

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.740 
help you clear it so that when you have
surgery<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.160> chemo<00:02:29.550> it<00:02:29.970> will<00:02:30.120> take<00:02:30.330> effect

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
surgery and chemo it will take effect

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.200 
surgery and chemo it will take effect
but<00:02:31.530> even<00:02:32.010> better<00:02:32.250> you<00:02:32.460> can<00:02:32.490> get<00:02:32.760> ahead<00:02:32.970> of<00:02:33.030> the

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
but even better you can get ahead of the

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.090 
but even better you can get ahead of the
curve<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.600> use<00:02:33.750> energy<00:02:33.990> medicine<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:34.770> avoid

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
curve and use energy medicine to avoid

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.810 
curve and use energy medicine to avoid
cancer<00:02:35.400> in<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.880> first<00:02:36.090> place<00:02:37.310> so<00:02:38.310> what<00:02:38.730> would
