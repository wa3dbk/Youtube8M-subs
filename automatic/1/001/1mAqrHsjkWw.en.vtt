00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:10.620
 microsoft surface tablet test 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.030
 pro 3 so here we will really see all 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.059
 the technical characteristics of this 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.250
 tablet then for comparison in 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.740
 does one go from the pro 2 surface to the 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.510
 surface pro3 of one of a diagonal of 10 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.609
 inches to a diagonal of 12 inches 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.740
 it's really interesting since there 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.720
 really feels like having a 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.140
 laptop actually with 7 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.690
 diagonal sizes and where microsoft 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.260
 really stands out is that the screen 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.840
 in fact 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.370
 showing the best resolution 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.090
 currently available for a 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.399
 touch pad 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.610
 so it's a screen with a technology 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:48.239
 clear type full hd which displays a 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.910
 resolution in 2160 by 1440 pixels 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.800
 so we have excellent contrast a 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.170
 very very good brightness we will see 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.629
 thereafter with the multimedia test 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.829
 but it's really a super super render 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.719
 for this tablet 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.059
 so that's the screen part 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.000
 now processor side actually 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.960
 microsoft has integrated intel processor 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.780
 core is declined in fact its surface for 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.610
 three in five different versions 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.380
 I will detail all the versions 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.210
 in the test but what to remember 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.210
 is that there are five versions and it's going 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.420
 from core i3 to core i7 and side 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.970
 rates that goes 2,799 euros for a core i3 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.369
 up to 2000 euros for an i7 core with 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.350
 either 4 gigas of ram or 8 gigas of ram 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.930
 and everything will be all that will be detailed 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.610
 in the test so here's for the part 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.840
 really hardware now we'll see 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.509
 the connection part 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.040
 so we go around the table 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.020
 so is there you see we find the 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.640
 windows button that actually allows 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.530
 to access the latest application 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.390
 opened 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.729
 then we will go to the bottom of the table 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.770
 so here is a small connector 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:57.060
 is mounted which allows to put the 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:00.119
 keyboard of the surface like this of 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.369
 the other side we have here like a little 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.450
 magnet connector and that allows to 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:09.259
 put the AC charger very convenient 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.680
 here a usb 3.0 cable 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:16.150
 so to transfer files 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.370
 or also put a usb key here we have 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.390
 a new port actually called the 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.219
 mini display port 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.049
 so it's a bit like a connector 

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:26.739
 hdmi since it allows to connect a 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:29.920
 monitor lcd a screen etc all that plays 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.480
 the dig in the test is passed over the 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.400
 top of the tablet 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.239
 so there we have nothing at all except 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:40.090
 the power on / off button here on the other 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.790
 side of the tablet we have a price a 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:46.290
 3.5 mm jack so either for 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:51.359
 connect headphones or speakers 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.359
 here the + me button for the volume 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.079
 now I go to the back part 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:58.930
 from the tablet 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:01.480
 so we have a camera 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:05.739
 5 megapixel digital camera with a 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:08.169
 sensor for the sound and is of course 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.030
 the famous crutch like this or let's see 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:11.530
 we can really tilt it a lot 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.980
 more than on the prese on the previous 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.519
 model 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.169
 that's very interesting and when we 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:20.139
 when you hold the crutch 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:22.989
 here we discover a slot to put 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:24.609
 microsd cards up to 128 giga 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.729
 so that's a very, very good 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:26.729
 news 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.699
 and so when we close with whom 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:34.389
 done like this and when I go back on 

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:37.030
 the front 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:39.639
 so here we have a webcam that seems 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.599
 like in the back makes 5 megapixels with 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:42.599
 a brightness sensor 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.790
 so that's it for all that's gone 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.989
 tablet connectivity 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.599
 now we'll see a little bit of everything 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:55.449
 that it embeds so there are our 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:59.680
 classics all that is wi fi ab 

00:03:55.449 --> 00:04:02.340
 gn bluetooth in 4.0 bass 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.340
 consumption 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.330
 and we have a chip rpm for the security of 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.629
 now 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.890
 so that's what I have pretty much everything 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:13.110
 what can we say for this tablet 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:16.560
 to finish we'll finish with 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:19.979
 dimensions so in length effect 135 mm 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.740
 in thickness 9.5 mm so you see 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:24.030
 it's very very hungry and for the weight 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.850
 is 800 grams 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.639
 so here we really lose 100 g per 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.919
 compared to the old version of the 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:36.330
 surface so I'm going to make you a 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:37.620
 little demo with the keyboard for you 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.440
 show that it's very easy to 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.330
 connect just showcase 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.100
 both like this you'll see that 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.800
 is done automatically with the part 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.150
 stale and it's ultra resistant so I 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.550
 want to show by taking in each other 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:54.030
 sense like this you see it's holds 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.139
 perfectly and the advantage with the 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.240
 crutch is that we transform 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:00.389
 all in real computer 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:03.389
 portable like these and it's done 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:05.789
 really very very easily so that's it 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:09.500
 for the technical characteristics of 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:09.500
 the tablet surface pro 3
