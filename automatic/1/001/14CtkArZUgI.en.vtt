another metal Sally's design actually

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.019 
another metal Sally's design actually
ended<00:00:24.119> up<00:00:24.180> being<00:00:24.359> extremely<00:00:24.869> similar<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.350> his

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
ended up being extremely similar to his

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.670 
ended up being extremely similar to his
of<00:00:27.029> course<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:27.900> probably<00:00:28.019> see<00:00:28.289> that<00:00:28.380> this<00:00:28.529> is

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
of course you probably see that this is

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.400 
of course you probably see that this is
a<00:00:28.710> pretty<00:00:29.119> battle<00:00:30.119> damaged<00:00:30.810> Metal<00:00:31.260> Sonic

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
a pretty battle damaged Metal Sonic

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.709 
a pretty battle damaged Metal Sonic
figure<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.189> because<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.120> got<00:00:33.329> this<00:00:33.450> in<00:00:33.630> the

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
figure that is because I got this in the

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.920 
figure that is because I got this in the
secondary<00:00:34.200> market<00:00:34.410> for<00:00:35.059> the<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.390> cost<00:00:36.630> of

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
secondary market for the the cost of

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.810 
secondary market for the the cost of
well<00:00:37.399> nothing<00:00:38.399> I<00:00:38.579> just<00:00:39.590> traded<00:00:40.590> for<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.129> silver

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
well nothing I just traded for a silver

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.470 
well nothing I just traded for a silver
figure<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.390> got<00:00:42.570> this<00:00:42.829> so<00:00:43.829> if<00:00:44.760> it's<00:00:45.030> damaged

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
figure and got this so if it's damaged

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.850 
figure and got this so if it's damaged
but<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.780> was<00:00:45.899> intact<00:00:46.200> enough<00:00:46.469> for<00:00:46.620> me<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.829> make

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
but it was intact enough for me to make

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.850 
but it was intact enough for me to make
this<00:00:47.100> custom<00:00:47.340> so<00:00:47.789> I'm<00:00:47.940> gonna<00:00:48.059> work<00:00:48.239> with<00:00:48.420> him

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
this custom so I'm gonna work with him

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.819 
this custom so I'm gonna work with him
okay<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:49.920> first<00:00:50.219> up<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.789> arms<00:00:51.469> mecha<00:00:52.469> Sally

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
okay so first up is the arms mecha Sally

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.340 
okay so first up is the arms mecha Sally
doesn't<00:00:53.399> add<00:00:53.610> those<00:00:53.940> shoulder<00:00:54.420> pads<00:00:54.719> at<00:00:55.050> Metal

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
doesn't add those shoulder pads at Metal

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.369 
doesn't add those shoulder pads at Metal
Sonic<00:00:55.530> calves<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.699> took<00:00:57.059> them<00:00:57.239> off<00:00:57.449> but<00:00:58.170> then

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
Sonic calves so I took them off but then

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.410 
Sonic calves so I took them off but then
the<00:00:58.620> pegs<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.399> connect<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.879> shoulders

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
the pegs that connect the shoulders

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.290 
the pegs that connect the shoulders
underneath<00:01:01.260> for<00:01:02.010> too<00:01:02.250> long<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:03.000> they<00:01:03.239> were

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
underneath for too long and they were

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.570 
underneath for too long and they were
making<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.809> joints<00:01:04.260> floppy<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:05.280> what<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.460> did

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
making the joints floppy so what I did

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.719 
making the joints floppy so what I did
was<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.600> pulled<00:01:06.960> those<00:01:07.290> long<00:01:07.710> pegs<00:01:08.100> out<00:01:08.400> and

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
was I pulled those long pegs out and

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.929 
was I pulled those long pegs out and
switched<00:01:09.479> them<00:01:09.810> with<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.650> shorter<00:01:11.159> pegs<00:01:11.460> from

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
switched them with the shorter pegs from

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.210 
switched them with the shorter pegs from
a<00:01:11.970> pair<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.479> Amy<00:01:12.840> Rose<00:01:13.170> arms<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.799> had<00:01:14.010> lying

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
a pair of Amy Rose arms I had lying

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.149 
a pair of Amy Rose arms I had lying
around<00:01:14.369> on<00:01:14.610> my<00:01:14.729> father<00:01:15.000> bin<00:01:15.890> will<00:01:16.890> see<00:01:17.040> the

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
around on my father bin will see the

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.370 
around on my father bin will see the
arms<00:01:17.430> all<00:01:17.610> painted<00:01:18.000> up<00:01:18.119> later<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:18.840> but<00:01:19.140> for<00:01:19.259> now

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
arms all painted up later so but for now

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.870 
arms all painted up later so but for now
let's<00:01:19.590> move<00:01:19.710> on<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.100> legs<00:01:20.310> which<00:01:20.610> use<00:01:20.850> a

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
let's move on to the legs which use a

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.660 
let's move on to the legs which use a
little<00:01:21.659> bit<00:01:21.750> more<00:01:21.810> work<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:23.130> yes

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
little bit more work so yes

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.620 
little bit more work so yes
the<00:01:23.759> legs<00:01:24.439> again<00:01:25.520> mecha<00:01:26.520> Sally's<00:01:27.030> legs<00:01:27.330> are

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
the legs again mecha Sally's legs are

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.710 
the legs again mecha Sally's legs are
pretty<00:01:28.439> much<00:01:28.619> identical<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.700> Metal<00:01:30.000> Sonic<00:01:30.180> so

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
pretty much identical to Metal Sonic so

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.130 
pretty much identical to Metal Sonic so
it's<00:01:31.439> mostly<00:01:31.799> repaint<00:01:32.869> except<00:01:33.869> for<00:01:34.020> her

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
it's mostly repaint except for her

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.249 
it's mostly repaint except for her
shoelace<00:01:34.650> thingies<00:01:35.189> which<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.689> made<00:01:37.020> out<00:01:37.140> of

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
shoelace thingies which I made out of

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.350 
shoelace thingies which I made out of
foam<00:01:37.530> board<00:01:37.860> that's<00:01:38.549> actually<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.000> piece<00:01:39.299> of

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
foam board that's actually a piece of

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.719 
foam board that's actually a piece of
foam<00:01:39.750> board<00:01:40.079> that<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:41.070> cut<00:01:41.460> in<00:01:41.700> half

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
foam board that is cut in half

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.090 
foam board that is cut in half
lengthwise<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.930> make<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.259> thinner<00:01:43.619> because

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
lengthwise to make it thinner because

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.620 
lengthwise to make it thinner because
regular<00:01:44.610> foam<00:01:44.850> board<00:01:45.119> would<00:01:45.270> be<00:01:45.299> way<00:01:45.570> too

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
regular foam board would be way too

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.219 
regular foam board would be way too
thick<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:48.149> debated<00:01:48.479> on<00:01:48.960> whether<00:01:49.020> I

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
thick and the I debated on whether I

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.590 
thick and the I debated on whether I
would<00:01:49.439> put<00:01:49.649> this<00:01:49.770> part<00:01:50.070> on<00:01:50.220> but<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.790> figured<00:01:51.360> I

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
would put this part on but I figured I

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.179 
would put this part on but I figured I
had<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.259> match<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.470> look<00:01:52.649> as<00:01:52.829> closely<00:01:53.040> as

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
had to match the look as closely as

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.090 
had to match the look as closely as
possible<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.390> put<00:01:55.049> what<00:01:55.619> I'm<00:01:55.710> gonna<00:01:55.829> call

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
possible so I put what I'm gonna call

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.139 
possible so I put what I'm gonna call
the<00:01:56.340> thigh<00:01:56.850> panels<00:01:58.159> if<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.460> basically<00:01:59.939> does<00:02:00.119> a

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
the thigh panels if it basically does a

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.999 
the thigh panels if it basically does a
piece<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.509> craft<00:02:00.840> foam<00:02:00.990> stuck<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.740> side<00:02:01.920> of

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
piece of craft foam stuck to the side of

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.609 
piece of craft foam stuck to the side of
the<00:02:02.100> leg<00:02:02.310> painted<00:02:03.270> Brown<00:02:04.009> I<00:02:05.360> mean<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.659> did<00:02:07.500> this

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
the leg painted Brown I mean I did this

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.500 
the leg painted Brown I mean I did this
for<00:02:07.860> accuracy<00:02:08.520> but<00:02:08.789> if<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.509> might<00:02:11.209> bring<00:02:12.209> it<00:02:12.360> up

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
for accuracy but if I might bring it up

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.490 
for accuracy but if I might bring it up
I

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
I

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.470 
I
really<00:02:13.860> this<00:02:14.340> is<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.610> one<00:02:14.850> flaw<00:02:15.090> of<00:02:15.150> Mecca

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
really this is the one flaw of Mecca

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.430 
really this is the one flaw of Mecca
sally's<00:02:15.930> design<00:02:16.230> for<00:02:16.410> me<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:16.530> don't<00:02:17.280> like<00:02:17.610> these

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
sally's design for me I don't like these

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.160 
sally's design for me I don't like these
flat<00:02:19.440> side<00:02:20.040> panel<00:02:20.700> things<00:02:21.060> I<00:02:21.390> mean<00:02:21.510> just<00:02:21.690> just

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
flat side panel things I mean just just

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.980 
flat side panel things I mean just just
give<00:02:22.590> her<00:02:22.800> thighs<00:02:23.190> or<00:02:23.730> give<00:02:24.060> her<00:02:24.210> skinny<00:02:24.570> legs

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
give her thighs or give her skinny legs

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.050 
give her thighs or give her skinny legs
don't<00:02:25.170> don't<00:02:25.560> don't<00:02:26.010> half-ass<00:02:26.520> it<00:02:26.790> with<00:02:26.910> these

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
don't don't don't half-ass it with these

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.310 
don't don't don't half-ass it with these
weird<00:02:27.330> panels<00:02:28.080> what<00:02:28.770> is<00:02:28.890> that<00:02:29.900> okay<00:02:30.900> so<00:02:31.140> let's

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
weird panels what is that okay so let's

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.140 
weird panels what is that okay so let's
move<00:02:31.470> on<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.980> most<00:02:32.130> involved<00:02:32.520> part<00:02:32.970> of<00:02:33.090> the

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
move on to the most involved part of the

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.500 
move on to the most involved part of the
bills<00:02:33.500> which<00:02:34.500> is<00:02:34.680> of<00:02:34.830> course<00:02:35.100> Mecca<00:02:35.970> Sally's

upper<00:02:36.959> torso<00:02:37.400> now<00:02:38.400> you<00:02:38.520> may<00:02:38.640> be<00:02:38.670> looking<00:02:39.120> at

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
upper torso now you may be looking at

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.449 
upper torso now you may be looking at
this<00:02:39.450> and<00:02:39.750> wondering<00:02:40.170> which<00:02:40.500> figure<00:02:40.830> I<00:02:40.890> use<00:02:41.190> as

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
this and wondering which figure I use as

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:42.949 
this and wondering which figure I use as
a<00:02:41.490> base<00:02:41.760> for<00:02:42.030> that<00:02:42.209> because<00:02:42.570> it<00:02:42.690> doesn't

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
a base for that because it doesn't

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.590 
a base for that because it doesn't
really<00:02:43.050> match<00:02:43.350> anything<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:44.580> answer<00:02:44.970> is<00:02:45.209> that

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
really match anything the answer is that

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.040 
really match anything the answer is that
it<00:02:45.810> made<00:02:46.110> from<00:02:46.320> scratch<00:02:46.880> yes<00:02:47.880> um<00:02:48.209> I<00:02:48.450> never<00:02:48.870> wear

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
it made from scratch yes um I never wear

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.930 
it made from scratch yes um I never wear
tried<00:02:49.350> this<00:02:49.530> with<00:02:49.680> my<00:02:49.860> polymer<00:02:50.310> clay<00:02:50.459> because

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
tried this with my polymer clay because

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.060 
tried this with my polymer clay because
that<00:02:51.150> stuff<00:02:51.420> tends<00:02:51.720> to<00:02:51.840> crumble<00:02:52.650> if<00:02:52.770> you<00:02:52.890> move

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
that stuff tends to crumble if you move

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.260 
that stuff tends to crumble if you move
it<00:02:53.220> too<00:02:53.370> much<00:02:53.610> but<00:02:54.239> um<00:02:55.190> but<00:02:56.190> when<00:02:56.730> I<00:02:56.760> found<00:02:57.090> out

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
it too much but um but when I found out

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.390 
it too much but um but when I found out
how<00:02:57.510> strong<00:02:57.810> my<00:02:57.900> super<00:02:58.440> sculpey<00:02:58.680> was<00:02:59.100> I

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
how strong my super sculpey was I

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.699 
how strong my super sculpey was I
thought<00:03:00.180> oh<00:03:00.450> yeah<00:03:00.810> this<00:03:01.080> could<00:03:01.260> totally<00:03:01.620> work

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
thought oh yeah this could totally work

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.250 
thought oh yeah this could totally work
as<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:01.920> substitute<00:03:02.459> I<00:03:02.760> probably<00:03:03.450> do<00:03:03.870> this<00:03:04.050> for

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
as a substitute I probably do this for

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.290 
as a substitute I probably do this for
every<00:03:04.680> female<00:03:04.980> body<00:03:05.520> that<00:03:05.670> I<00:03:05.880> ever<00:03:06.030> made

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
every female body that I ever made

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.130 
every female body that I ever made
because<00:03:07.700> with<00:03:08.700> MECA<00:03:08.940> Sally<00:03:09.270> everything<00:03:09.989> is

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
because with MECA Sally everything is

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.990 
because with MECA Sally everything is
all<00:03:10.320> angular<00:03:10.980> meant<00:03:11.520> so<00:03:11.640> I<00:03:11.670> don't<00:03:11.820> have<00:03:11.880> to

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
all angular meant so I don't have to

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.550 
all angular meant so I don't have to
worry<00:03:12.150> about<00:03:12.239> making<00:03:12.570> things<00:03:12.870> round<00:03:13.140> and

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
worry about making things round and

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.270 
worry about making things round and
curbing<00:03:14.010> all<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.370> right<00:03:14.489> spots<00:03:15.980> however<00:03:16.980> it

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
curbing all the right spots however it

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.930 
curbing all the right spots however it
does<00:03:17.660> reattach<00:03:18.660> to<00:03:19.250> what<00:03:20.250> what<00:03:20.400> you<00:03:20.519> just<00:03:20.640> saw

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
does reattach to what what you just saw

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.960 
does reattach to what what you just saw
was<00:03:21.180> metal<00:03:22.110> Sonic's<00:03:22.560> original<00:03:23.100> hips<00:03:23.400> with

Sally's<00:03:24.959> little<00:03:25.260> pointed<00:03:25.650> tail<00:03:25.890> made<00:03:26.580> on<00:03:26.730> the

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
Sally's little pointed tail made on the

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.110 
Sally's little pointed tail made on the
back<00:03:27.060> so<00:03:27.720> this<00:03:28.440> upper<00:03:28.739> torso<00:03:29.220> is<00:03:29.700> actually

pretty awesome and and it is my first
real<00:03:48.530> custom<00:03:49.530> fabricated<00:03:50.370> part<00:03:51.000> for<00:03:51.660> an

real custom fabricated part for an
action<00:03:52.170> figure

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
action figure

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.720 
action figure
and<00:03:52.739> of<00:03:53.340> that<00:03:53.370> I<00:03:53.610> am<00:03:53.940> very<00:03:54.299> proud<00:03:55.549> so<00:03:56.549> yeah

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
and of that I am very proud so yeah

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.370 
and of that I am very proud so yeah
that's<00:03:57.000> a<00:03:57.209> take<00:03:57.510> a<00:03:57.540> quick<00:03:57.780> look<00:03:57.959> at<00:03:58.079> her<00:03:58.200> body

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
that's a take a quick look at her body

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.729 
that's a take a quick look at her body
completed<00:03:59.220> see<00:03:59.730> see<00:03:59.970> I<00:04:00.269> wanted<00:04:00.870> those<00:04:01.049> legs<00:04:01.410> to

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
completed see see I wanted those legs to

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.100 
completed see see I wanted those legs to
be<00:04:01.910> securely<00:04:02.910> in<00:04:03.239> so<00:04:03.630> that<00:04:03.750> I<00:04:03.780> wouldn't<00:04:04.019> have

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
be securely in so that I wouldn't have

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.600 
be securely in so that I wouldn't have
to<00:04:04.230> worry<00:04:04.380> about<00:04:04.470> them<00:04:04.739> wobbling<00:04:05.250> because<00:04:05.519> the

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
to worry about them wobbling because the

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.960 
to worry about them wobbling because the
shoulders<00:04:05.970> wobble<00:04:06.390> just<00:04:06.630> a<00:04:06.720> little<00:04:06.930> bit<00:04:07.110> so

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
shoulders wobble just a little bit so

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.979 
shoulders wobble just a little bit so
that's<00:04:08.970> another<00:04:09.299> reason<00:04:09.510> I<00:04:09.690> kept<00:04:09.870> the

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
that's another reason I kept the

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.670 
that's another reason I kept the
original<00:04:10.019> hips<00:04:11.150> so<00:04:12.150> this<00:04:12.329> is<00:04:12.510> a<00:04:12.540> melt<00:04:13.350> mecca

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
original hips so this is a melt mecca

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.940 
original hips so this is a melt mecca
Sally's<00:04:14.130> body<00:04:14.459> and<00:04:14.790> um<00:04:15.000> yeah<00:04:15.840> really<00:04:16.709> taught

Sally's body and um yeah really taught

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.159 
Sally's body and um yeah really taught
accomplishment<00:04:17.519> of<00:04:17.579> mine<00:04:17.729> all<00:04:18.720> that<00:04:18.989> really

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
accomplishment of mine all that really

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.370 
accomplishment of mine all that really
leaves<00:04:19.470> is<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:19.890> head<00:04:20.220> so<00:04:21.150> it's<00:04:22.020> of<00:04:22.229> course

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
leaves is the head so it's of course

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.930 
leaves is the head so it's of course
still<00:04:22.830> gonna<00:04:22.950> be<00:04:23.099> metal<00:04:23.370> Sonic's<00:04:23.760> head

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
still gonna be metal Sonic's head

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:24.770 
still gonna be metal Sonic's head
because<00:04:24.180> the<00:04:24.270> shape

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
because the shape

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.720 
because the shape
similar<00:04:25.200> but<00:04:25.890> I<00:04:26.280> found<00:04:26.490> something

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
similar but I found something

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.820 
similar but I found something
interesting<00:04:27.390> when<00:04:27.510> I<00:04:27.570> cut<00:04:27.870> off<00:04:28.020> the<00:04:28.200> top<00:04:28.440> spine

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
interesting when I cut off the top spine

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.130 
interesting when I cut off the top spine
because<00:04:29.310> it<00:04:29.430> wasn't<00:04:29.700> necessarily<00:04:30.150> and<00:04:30.510> that

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
because it wasn't necessarily and that

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.220 
because it wasn't necessarily and that
is<00:04:31.380> that<00:04:31.770> metal<00:04:32.400> sonic<00:04:32.760> is<00:04:33.000> the<00:04:33.150> only<00:04:33.390> Jazwares

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
is that metal sonic is the only Jazwares

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.280 
is that metal sonic is the only Jazwares
figure<00:04:34.620> I've<00:04:34.740> seen<00:04:35.040> so<00:04:35.280> far<00:04:35.310> which<00:04:36.210> is<00:04:36.240> cast<00:04:36.840> in

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
figure I've seen so far which is cast in

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.190 
figure I've seen so far which is cast in
a<00:04:37.500> white<00:04:37.950> plastic<00:04:38.520> which<00:04:39.210> is<00:04:39.240> then<00:04:39.540> painted

a white plastic which is then painted

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.560 
a white plastic which is then painted
most<00:04:41.100> other<00:04:41.340> figures<00:04:41.700> I've<00:04:41.880> seen<00:04:42.180> are

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
most other figures I've seen are

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.530 
most other figures I've seen are
basically<00:04:43.470> cast<00:04:43.890> in<00:04:44.310> the<00:04:44.550> primary<00:04:45.030> color<00:04:45.330> that

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
basically cast in the primary color that

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.380 
basically cast in the primary color that
the<00:04:45.690> character<00:04:46.230> is<00:04:46.260> and<00:04:46.710> then<00:04:47.490> only<00:04:47.820> details

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
the character is and then only details

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.810 
the character is and then only details
are<00:04:48.600> painted<00:04:49.160> that's<00:04:50.160> an<00:04:50.340> interesting<00:04:50.790> little

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:10.979 
you know that that is a different

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:13.219 
you know that that is a different
continuity<00:06:11.520> but<00:06:11.760> um<00:06:11.970> the<00:06:12.630> only<00:06:12.780> thing<00:06:12.870> that<00:06:13.110> we
