00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 Talk to people, welcome to another one. 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.420
 video of the writing here and channel 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.010
 In this video I'll show you the 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.160
 ian kleber's pc 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.900
 This is the number 165 a pc gamer of 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.179
 entry but will run and all 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.890
 games at least with reduced graphics 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.750
 of course if you want to participate here 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.970
 on the channel you just follow the link you 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.100
 is below in the description and also 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.289
 is always on the lookout for the 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.119
 next p6 here on fan page 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.189
 so let's go to the images of 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.080
 Forget it, let's get this first one. 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.450
 image as we are always showing 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.680
 all components that make up the 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.630
 configuration itself 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.940
 In this case he has an office where 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.160
 source input at the top 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.050
 this is not very good since the source pulls 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.270
 all the hot air that is inside the 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.379
 cabinet and makes it warm more 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.050
 than natural 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.930
 the ideal would be an office where the source 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.090
 hoe on the bottom and control 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.420
 corn is pretty basic processor is a 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.770
 rpg fx 6 300 to cool them with 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.710
 led before even comes with 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.939
 processor the morning plate a nimble and 95 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.580
 at 78 lml xbr and it has a 4gb comb 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.420
 of who I am with a clock of 1,600 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.479
 mega ref 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.130
 but from there without the heatsink 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.530
 to store all the data and has 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.250
 only 1h seagate drawing of 500 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.060
 pounds 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.100
 the video card is one and see the gtx 650 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.439
 take care of the super bock that comes with 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.659
 factory overclock so she will have 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.000
 a performance higher than the reference 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.650
 and so galera is an entry plate is 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.509
 recommended for those who want to start 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.549
 run the games at least on graphics 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.860
 and with lower resolutions 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.170
 lower than lamb and she is good 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.020
 because it has a very good cost benefit 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.850
 she does not like more than 450 reais 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.060
 with one this time you will be able to rotate 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.470
 games like gta 5 bec four and all 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.880
 these most current games 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.720
 Of course, as has been said before 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.360
 with lower resolution that was hd the source 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.610
 he is using is a region of 430 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.500
 gods very good bridge 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.579
 she has her and theaters and it is very 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.890
 recommended for this type of 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.750
 configuration and in case if he wants it 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.480
 you can upgrade to a 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.720
 gtx 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.100
 150 territory broadly with the gtx 750 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.200
 has it going to achieve performance 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.870
 much better and the light source that matters 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.390
 it is a good part that needs more 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.580
 the trade would certainly have the cabinet is 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.920
 as I said at the outset this type of 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.630
 cabinet is not very recommended of course 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.250
 sometimes the person is out of money already 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.830
 has a cid cabinet on another pc 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.690
 old and end up using this does not have 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.640
 nothing bad from the crowd instead 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.920
 performance will be the same but is 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.840
 sharp that is not ideal for pc gamer 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.330
 he still managed to steal the 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.640
 Very good cable, congratulations to the island. 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.320
 He has a nice machine, guys, if you guys 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.910
 Did you like the video, do not forget to leave it. 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.890
 its limit that helps a lot in 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.730
 disclosure any question they have 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.040
 in the comments 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.990
 and I ask the owner to respond to you a 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.380
 hug everyone and until the next video 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.380
 went
