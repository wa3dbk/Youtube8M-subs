00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
 good 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.440
 very good to all kids I'm hugo 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.730
 this again here I bring you the new 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.890
 video that has just taken creative 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.180
 assembly with a naval battle here 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.589
 we see the barbarian ships which 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.390
 they are completely composed by 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:56.149
 barbarian units are pretty ships 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.030
 resistant made with European wood and 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.610
 who will fight against Roman ships 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.309
 in this case they are composed of ships 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.790
 by the unit of the soft short 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.619
 masters who are masters of hesse sword 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.800
 very good units in body combat 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.810
 to body as you see the new great novelty 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.550
 is that you can clean up the boats is 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.350
 say charge against them with our 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.060
 boat and crash them trying 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.649
 cause them the greatest possible harm and 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.020
 besides that he has always has 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:26.390
 provided the opportunity to disembark 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.850
 by the front of our 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.890
 ships in the enemy frame which will do 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.860
 also that we can land several 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.229
 boats at once with elite troops 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.940
 about Roman ships which will prevent 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.319
 that those balls that are formed 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.990
 banal form and seconds 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:43.820
 You also see the bad weather 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.830
 which makes the battles very 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.470
 interesting the graphics are in ultra 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.930
 right here and how the boats move 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.400
 They are somerset and can be damaged by 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.060
 the sea of â€‹â€‹time in case the 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.950
 control more badly than they have told us 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.960
 here you see how they are attacking some 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.810
 units a little lower are the clubs 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.570
 levy bas's basically and well 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.340
 they take the lead and this time 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.039
 we are seeing how the 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.190
 Longbow archers against a ship 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:14.620
 Roman which once the troops of the 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.630
 upper cover are dead those of 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.420
 the lower deck say to the race 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.400
 santa run good here we see another view 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.900
 in one other other type of boats the 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.940
 which in this case you see that they have as 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.190
 two lanterns in the front 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.780
 these two lanterns are explosives that 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.120
 when they make contact with ships 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.980
 enemies will cause an explosion something 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.019
 you will see bomb 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.760
 then after the onslaught it causes a 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.410
 explosion that caused some damage in 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.849
 the enemy's helmet equally and 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.310
 fire arrows remain the 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:44.799
 combat quite realistic the fire 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.450
 as the same in it are two and could 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.870
 a possibility of setting fire to the ship 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.200
 enemy 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.940
 here as we see the combats are based 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.489
 much in the attacks they dress them 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.170
 front from behind while disembarking 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.150
 another boat will dress him for a flank 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.950
 one of the elite births for 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.470
 disembark read a three against one 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.420
 they also explode and explosively doing 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.310
 the battles very interesting but what 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.440
 what you want to see is pumba destruction 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.480
 sent a large ship against a ship 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.459
 small when you rame ais the boats 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.890
 burst into pieces as was the case 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.629
 actually you can even go through and 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.700
 continue with your boat on the other 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:22.129
 side causing very large casualties to the 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.379
 enemy army as you see the battles 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:25.790
 are the most promising 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:27.410
 naval battles like our 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.370
 subtraction is day 3 we had the game 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.370
 until new kids
