00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:10.299
 hello and welcome to one of the new ones 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:13.400
 scenarios from bed 5.2 attack 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:15.259
 now the scenario will be like that 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.760
 also all other scenarios with us 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:18.710
 played twice the speed 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.509
 to give you an overview 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.039
 to get 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:24.800
 other tasks are and what ever 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.109
 Here happens or happens as he 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.519
 starts as soon as the scenario starts all over 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.880
 normal on a ship German you have 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:34.070
 you so a bird of prey and afterwards 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.039
 a given route currently flies 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.870
 you have no influence here 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:40.250
 any control or other and 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.840
 now you will be hit by a lightning 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:47.329
 and crashes and now find yourself in 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.250
 stage 2 the quest so now you have the 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:50.989
 ambush which you to crash 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.820
 he practically survived 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:58.329
 This is quite easy by going here 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.329
 just kill the approaching enemies 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:18.689
 as soon as you do that 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.810
 has there on the spur you need to here 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.360
 just just follow the npc which one 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.970
 always accompanies and guides you 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.490
 you to the entrance of the opponent 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.479
 camps and there you have to first the 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.369
 siege speak the enemy as well as 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.450
 the barriers destroy her can you 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.520
 everything against it 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.409
 it does not hurt much though 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.090
 should be possible if so 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.940
 possibility simply out of the circle 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.659
 run around so you do not have any here 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.659
 get problems 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.160
 once you have destroyed the siege 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.170
 it goes on directly as we run 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.019
 just go into the camp and now 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.290
 expect one of the first smaller ones 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:23.330
 opponents to the previously we forward 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.830
 see the mpc he is following the whole 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.780
 time and finally you have to 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:31.150
 fight against this but first would have to 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.150
 to do one of his protectors 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.770
 once you've done that, you just have to 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.110
 still practically down the bridge 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.120
 Protect them that you are here 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.860
 already in the background can pull and 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.200
 there then fought again against the 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.450
 as opposed to a companion as 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.270
 the possession of a mask and if he 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.670
 has conquered these 2 is the scenario 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:27.440
 manages to get management and the 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.440
 Bolts take over the island
