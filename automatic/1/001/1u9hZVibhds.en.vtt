 However, today we are receiving Miyanagi Nagi and delivering it, but still 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:16.270
 Have not heard the album story of home-ku, I'd heard Toka story of the public traveling alone from earlier

 Amazing elaborate thing was salmon Ya Naa sleeve case is cut out in such form is 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:33.350
 If I put it on, I would rate it

 Oh Rutte but I feel say this to say would by and I myself twice in jacket 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.680
 I don't know what it means, but this is a relationship between the title ur and this form 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:44.530

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:50.770
 I this time in so so now Sai Kan that there are prima facie 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:57.250
 Every time before I think I really think that Sukuruto is also a nice sense of words in one word but I do not know 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:58.670
 This so-called What I teacher I'd say it is nice to true come looking for a word 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:03.350
 Well that 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:07.009
 Originally it's there is a word called on its back 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:12.770
 I'm going to bring the back of the lag meeting secretary high 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:13.790
 Oh, it 's a word that says it's drawn upside down and turned upside down and chosen 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.570
 But 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.659
 Aso originally the theme of the album is inseparable 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.469
 Two 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:25.040
 Such as that complemented each have supplemented What do this each other or not there 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:27.560
 Yes this time because it was that theme 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.939
 That's Nee's word 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:35.650
 Well now I was much that was said so in various Anno 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:41.860
 What is it if not what is sold in the table I think it is calm 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:45.190
 Oh, right now I'm pretty much back at that single, but that spring and that 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:48.820
 I think I thought it was winter 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:52.960
 Atmos Mandy Valentine or something like a new tsunami violation 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:59.370
 Fine of the front and back pieces something also that sort of 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:02.440
 Yes, because that which way or one's that there is something like such a thing not exist 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:07.480
 Hey about that 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:12.600
 If it is something that can be explained in one word what is the song in the rain after all, it will be a song 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:18.540
 I think it's good I do n't think it's a mother, so I'm singing because it's a song 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.540
