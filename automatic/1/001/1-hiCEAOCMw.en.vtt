just beginning with the idea of soloing

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.000 
just beginning with the idea of soloing
is<00:00:38.270> try<00:00:39.270> just<00:00:39.420> using<00:00:39.480> one<00:00:39.840> note<00:00:40.020> which<00:00:40.829> I<00:00:40.950> know

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
sounds crazy but you'll actually find

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.010

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
that there's a lot you can do with one

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.209 
that there's a lot you can do with one
note<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.550> that<00:00:47.550> sometimes<00:00:49.010> limitations<00:00:50.010> can

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
note and that sometimes limitations can

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.880 
note and that sometimes limitations can
actually<00:00:50.579> be<00:00:50.700> extremely<00:00:51.210> liberating<00:00:51.770> so<00:00:52.770> if

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
actually be extremely liberating so if

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.860 
actually be extremely liberating so if
we<00:00:52.980> think<00:00:53.100> about<00:00:53.250> one<00:00:53.640> note<00:00:53.940> we<00:00:54.420> can<00:00:54.600> really

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.020 
a story that means you're going to want
to<00:02:28.070> have<00:02:28.280> a<00:02:28.520> beginning<00:02:28.940> a<00:02:29.239> middle<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:30.440> an<00:02:30.680> end

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
to have a beginning a middle and an end

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.000 
to have a beginning a middle and an end
and<00:02:32.290> hopefully<00:02:33.290> if<00:02:33.410> you're<00:02:33.530> really<00:02:33.830> thinking

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
and hopefully if you're really thinking

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.580 
and hopefully if you're really thinking
about<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.520> momentum<00:02:35.030> it<00:02:35.300> sort<00:02:35.870> of<00:02:35.930> starts<00:02:36.410> as

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
about the momentum it sort of starts as

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.590 
about the momentum it sort of starts as
a<00:02:36.620> place<00:02:36.920> that<00:02:37.100> it<00:02:37.190> starts<00:02:37.519> out<00:02:37.640> and<00:02:37.910> then<00:02:38.450> it

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
a place that it starts out and then it

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.199 
a place that it starts out and then it
rises<00:02:38.900> up<00:02:39.230> to<00:02:39.410> its<00:02:39.709> peak<00:02:40.040> just<00:02:40.610> before<00:02:41.090> the

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
rises up to its peak just before the

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:42.430 
rises up to its peak just before the
ending<00:02:41.510> and<00:02:41.660> you<00:02:41.720> bring<00:02:41.900> it<00:02:42.019> back<00:02:42.110> down<00:02:42.410> again

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
ending and you bring it back down again

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.270 
ending and you bring it back down again
so<00:02:42.920> to<00:02:43.790> kind<00:02:44.150> of<00:02:44.209> keep<00:02:44.480> that<00:02:44.870> idea<00:02:45.800> of<00:02:46.070> energy

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
so to kind of keep that idea of energy

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.479 
so to kind of keep that idea of energy
and<00:02:46.820> emotion<00:02:47.630> as<00:02:47.840> sort<00:02:48.530> of<00:02:48.590> your<00:02:48.739> meter<00:02:49.040> for

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
and emotion as sort of your meter for

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.150 
and emotion as sort of your meter for
your<00:02:49.610> solo<00:02:50.120> it'll<00:02:51.110> really<00:02:51.350> give<00:02:51.680> you<00:02:51.799> some

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
your solo it'll really give you some

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.490 
your solo it'll really give you some
nice<00:02:52.340> places<00:02:52.610> to<00:02:52.790> go<00:02:53.060> so<00:02:53.360> just<00:02:53.720> a<00:02:54.140> small

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
nice places to go so just a small

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.830 
nice places to go so just a small
example<00:02:54.910> again<00:02:55.910> I'll<00:02:56.000> be<00:02:56.150> in<00:02:56.239> my<00:02:56.330> a<00:02:56.540> minor

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
example again I'll be in my a minor

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.900 
example again I'll be in my a minor
pentatonic<00:02:57.230> here<00:02:57.769> so<00:02:58.519> I'm<00:02:58.610> going<00:02:58.700> to<00:02:58.760> have

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
pentatonic here so I'm going to have

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.120 
pentatonic here so I'm going to have
starting<00:02:59.750> place<00:02:59.989> so<00:03:00.290> maybe<00:03:00.500> just<00:03:00.799> something

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
starting place so maybe just something

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:11.080 
starting place so maybe just something
very<00:03:01.160> simple<00:03:01.670> and<00:03:01.910> slow

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.580 

so<00:03:12.090> that<00:03:12.210> would<00:03:12.330> be<00:03:12.420> my<00:03:12.570> starting<00:03:12.990> place<00:03:13.110> now

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
so that would be my starting place now

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.290 
so that would be my starting place now
the<00:03:13.650> middle<00:03:13.980> I<00:03:14.280> want<00:03:14.490> to<00:03:14.640> go<00:03:14.790> away<00:03:14.940> a<00:03:15.090> little

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
the middle I want to go away a little

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.340 
the middle I want to go away a little
bit<00:03:15.420> I<00:03:15.540> want<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:15.780> get<00:03:15.900> a<00:03:15.930> little<00:03:16.080> bit<00:03:16.260> more

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
bit I want to get a little bit more

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:26.110 
bit I want to get a little bit more
interesting<00:03:16.890> so<00:03:16.920> now<00:03:17.250> maybe

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.290 

okay

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
okay

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.290 
okay
so<00:03:27.420> now<00:03:28.140> the<00:03:28.200> story<00:03:28.740> is<00:03:28.860> going<00:03:29.010> somewhere<00:03:29.550> now

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
so now the story is going somewhere now

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.640 
so now the story is going somewhere now
I'm<00:03:30.720> going<00:03:30.900> to<00:03:30.960> want<00:03:31.080> to<00:03:31.140> get<00:03:31.230> to<00:03:31.350> the<00:03:31.440> point

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
I'm going to want to get to the point

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.380 
I'm going to want to get to the point
where<00:03:31.830> I'm<00:03:31.920> really<00:03:32.220> kind<00:03:32.670> of<00:03:32.730> getting<00:03:32.940> up<00:03:33.120> near

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
where I'm really kind of getting up near

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:49.690 
where I'm really kind of getting up near
the<00:03:33.540> top<00:03:33.570> so

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.940 

and<00:03:50.240> now<00:03:50.930> we're<00:03:51.470> going<00:03:51.560> to<00:03:51.650> bring<00:03:51.770> it<00:03:51.920> back

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
and now we're going to bring it back

00:03:51.950 --> 00:04:09.530 
and now we're going to bring it back
down<00:03:52.310> to<00:03:52.610> close<00:03:52.970> it<00:03:53.150> for<00:03:53.180> that<00:03:53.450> ending

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.390 

and<00:04:10.730> if<00:04:11.730> you're<00:04:12.030> feeling<00:04:12.829> like<00:04:13.829> challenging

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
and if you're feeling like challenging

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.939 
and if you're feeling like challenging
yourself<00:04:14.760> if<00:04:14.939> you<00:04:15.360> can<00:04:15.510> remember<00:04:15.989> what<00:04:16.799> your

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
yourself if you can remember what your

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:18.890 
yourself if you can remember what your
beginning<00:04:17.370> idea<00:04:17.790> was<00:04:18.060> if<00:04:18.269> you<00:04:18.389> can<00:04:18.540> bring<00:04:18.720> the

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
beginning idea was if you can bring the

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.689 
beginning idea was if you can bring the
solo<00:04:19.139> back<00:04:19.560> to<00:04:19.949> something<00:04:20.280> similar<00:04:20.519> to<00:04:20.669> that

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:20.699 
solo back to something similar to that

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:24.170 
solo back to something similar to that
original<00:04:21.359> idea<00:04:22.160> it<00:04:23.160> can<00:04:23.340> really<00:04:23.850> tie<00:04:24.030> together

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
original idea it can really tie together

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.199 
original idea it can really tie together
the<00:04:24.389> solo<00:04:24.690> nicely
