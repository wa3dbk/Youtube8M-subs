again I wouldn't recommend or for myself
I<00:04:16.640> would<00:04:16.970> not<00:04:17.180> be<00:04:17.390> able<00:04:17.480> to<00:04:17.660> follow<00:04:17.900> this

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.170 
I would not be able to follow this

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.810 
I would not be able to follow this
regiment<00:04:18.739> in<00:04:18.829> other<00:04:18.950> words<00:04:19.160> I<00:04:19.310> wouldn't<00:04:19.730> be

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
regiment in other words I wouldn't be

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.610 
regiment in other words I wouldn't be
able<00:04:19.880> to<00:04:20.000> add<00:04:20.239> every<00:04:20.780> single<00:04:21.140> food<00:04:21.290> that<00:04:21.500> I<00:04:21.530> eat

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
able to add every single food that I eat

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.100 
able to add every single food that I eat
in<00:04:21.859> here<00:04:22.040> or<00:04:22.250> every<00:04:22.400> single<00:04:22.880> exercise<00:04:23.390> but<00:04:23.930> I

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
in here or every single exercise but I

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.350 
in here or every single exercise but I
think<00:04:24.590> it's<00:04:24.710> a<00:04:24.830> real<00:04:25.070> cool<00:04:25.370> overall<00:04:26.000> view<00:04:26.330> of

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
think it's a real cool overall view of

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.480 
think it's a real cool overall view of
kind<00:04:27.110> of<00:04:27.260> how<00:04:27.410> much<00:04:27.620> calories<00:04:27.860> you're<00:04:28.220> taking

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
kind of how much calories you're taking

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:29.560 
kind of how much calories you're taking
in<00:04:28.610> how<00:04:28.760> much<00:04:28.940> calories<00:04:29.180> you're<00:04:29.540> burning

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
in how much calories you're burning

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.290 
in how much calories you're burning
again<00:04:30.380> I<00:04:30.740> don't<00:04:30.950> know<00:04:31.220> how<00:04:31.490> accurate<00:04:32.150> this

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
again I don't know how accurate this

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.390 
again I don't know how accurate this
thing<00:04:32.540> is<00:04:32.720> but<00:04:33.080> I<00:04:33.320> think<00:04:33.800> it's<00:04:33.920> a<00:04:34.010> really<00:04:34.040> cool

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
thing is but I think it's a really cool

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.310 
thing is but I think it's a really cool
idea<00:04:34.520> and<00:04:34.850> I<00:04:35.000> think<00:04:35.030> again<00:04:35.570> just<00:04:35.870> as<00:04:36.020> a<00:04:36.050> good

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
idea and I think again just as a good

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.350 
idea and I think again just as a good
overview<00:04:36.830> if<00:04:37.100> you're<00:04:37.520> somebody<00:04:37.820> that<00:04:38.030> likes

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
overview if you're somebody that likes

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.390 
overview if you're somebody that likes
to<00:04:38.540> follow<00:04:38.810> a<00:04:38.960> schedule<00:04:39.290> and<00:04:39.590> can<00:04:39.890> type<00:04:40.160> in

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
to follow a schedule and can type in

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.610 
to follow a schedule and can type in
every<00:04:40.760> single<00:04:40.940> food<00:04:41.240> you<00:04:41.390> eat<00:04:41.450> more<00:04:42.140> power<00:04:42.380> to

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
every single food you eat more power to

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.920 
every single food you eat more power to
you<00:04:42.740> I<00:04:42.890> personally<00:04:43.400> cannot<00:04:43.910> do<00:04:44.150> this<00:04:44.330> so<00:04:44.630> I

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
you I personally cannot do this so I

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.140 
you I personally cannot do this so I
wouldn't<00:04:45.650> be<00:04:45.680> able<00:04:45.800> to<00:04:45.950> use<00:04:46.250> this<00:04:46.520> app<00:04:46.730> for<00:04:47.000> all

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
wouldn't be able to use this app for all

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.850 
wouldn't be able to use this app for all
it's<00:04:47.390> meant<00:04:47.600> to<00:04:47.780> but<00:04:48.200> I<00:04:48.260> think<00:04:48.350> it's<00:04:48.680> really

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
it's meant to but I think it's really

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.040 
it's meant to but I think it's really
cool<00:04:49.160> to<00:04:49.220> just<00:04:49.460> see<00:04:49.580> again<00:04:50.390> for<00:04:50.750> instance

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
cool to just see again for instance

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.660 
cool to just see again for instance

those i know that i'm getting about 650
calories<00:05:24.860> same<00:05:25.280> thing<00:05:25.460> with<00:05:25.580> the<00:05:25.610> sodium<00:05:26.150> tons

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 
calories same thing with the sodium tons

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.270 
calories same thing with the sodium tons
and<00:05:26.900> tons<00:05:27.020> of<00:05:27.200> sodium<00:05:27.560> you<00:05:27.710> can<00:05:27.890> tell<00:05:28.040> here

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
and tons of sodium you can tell here

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.360 
and tons of sodium you can tell here
also<00:05:28.790> really<00:05:29.690> high<00:05:29.900> on<00:05:30.140> total<00:05:30.530> fat<00:05:30.740> 31<00:05:31.220> grams

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
also really high on total fat 31 grams

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.280 
also really high on total fat 31 grams
again<00:05:31.820> I<00:05:31.970> don't<00:05:32.180> know<00:05:32.270> how<00:05:32.419> accurate<00:05:32.930> this<00:05:33.050> is

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.290 
again I don't know how accurate this is

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.670 
again I don't know how accurate this is
but<00:05:33.770> I<00:05:33.800> think<00:05:34.070> it's<00:05:34.190> a<00:05:34.280> just<00:05:34.550> cool<00:05:34.850> idea

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
but I think it's a just cool idea

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.380 
but I think it's a just cool idea
especially<00:05:36.680> just<00:05:37.160> to<00:05:37.250> get<00:05:37.460> a<00:05:37.490> ballpark<00:05:38.120> figure

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:21.349 
question would think again this this app

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:23.800 
question would think again this this app
is<00:06:21.590> extremely<00:06:22.310> feature-rich<00:06:22.699> it<00:06:23.030> and<00:06:23.180> I<00:06:23.599> just

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:23.810 
is extremely feature-rich it and I just

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.270 
is extremely feature-rich it and I just
closed<00:06:24.139> out<00:06:24.289> of<00:06:24.469> the<00:06:24.560> application<00:06:25.129> so<00:06:25.219> I'm

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:25.280 
closed out of the application so I'm

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.679 
closed out of the application so I'm
going<00:06:25.400> to<00:06:25.430> go<00:06:25.520> back<00:06:25.699> in<00:06:25.879> it<00:06:26.000> I'm<00:06:26.300> not<00:06:26.509> going<00:06:26.629> to

00:06:26.679 --> 00:06:26.689 
going to go back in it I'm not going to

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:29.649 
going to go back in it I'm not going to
go<00:06:26.810> in<00:06:26.930> it<00:06:27.020> that's<00:06:27.259> basically<00:06:27.800> the<00:06:27.889> main<00:06:28.659> the

00:06:29.649 --> 00:06:29.659 
go in it that's basically the main the

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:32.350 
go in it that's basically the main the
main<00:06:29.689> review<00:06:30.650> of<00:06:30.889> lose<00:06:31.550> it<00:06:31.759> I<00:06:31.879> think<00:06:32.150> it's<00:06:32.270> a

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 
main review of lose it I think it's a

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.450 
main review of lose it I think it's a
great<00:06:32.509> app<00:06:32.840> especially<00:06:33.050> for<00:06:33.860> being<00:06:34.069> a<00:06:34.159> free

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 
great app especially for being a free

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.820 
great app especially for being a free
app<00:06:34.610> you<00:06:34.849> really<00:06:35.240> can't<00:06:35.539> why<00:06:36.080> I<00:06:36.110> don't<00:06:36.650> want<00:06:36.770> to

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:38.389 
say you can't beat this out but i think

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:39.939

that<00:06:38.449> they<00:06:38.719> put<00:06:38.990> a<00:06:39.020> lot<00:06:39.319> into<00:06:39.620> this

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:39.949 
that they put a lot into this

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:42.159 
that they put a lot into this
application<00:06:40.729> um<00:06:40.909> especially<00:06:41.509> for<00:06:41.900> being<00:06:42.020> a
