super durable for the weight of the
jacket<00:00:59.180> and<00:00:59.829> they<00:01:00.829> then<00:01:01.010> looked<00:01:01.309> at<00:01:01.550> the

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
jacket and they then looked at the

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:03.819 
jacket and they then looked at the
mobility<00:01:02.750> of<00:01:02.780> the<00:01:02.899> jacket<00:01:03.260> they<00:01:03.440> wanted<00:01:03.739> to

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
mobility of the jacket they wanted to

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.450 
mobility of the jacket they wanted to
make<00:01:03.980> it<00:01:04.810> non<00:01:05.810> restrictive<00:01:06.079> and<00:01:06.619> had<00:01:06.740> a<00:01:06.770> huge

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
make it non restrictive and had a huge

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.830 
make it non restrictive and had a huge
range<00:01:07.759> of<00:01:07.909> articulation

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
range of articulation

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.700 
range of articulation
so<00:01:09.159> we've<00:01:10.159> taken<00:01:10.450> special<00:01:11.450> korloff<00:01:12.170> inserts

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
so we've taken special korloff inserts

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.010 
so we've taken special korloff inserts
and<00:01:12.979> put<00:01:13.340> them<00:01:13.490> under<00:01:13.820> the<00:01:13.850> arms<00:01:14.270> here<00:01:14.510> to

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
and put them under the arms here to

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.100 
and put them under the arms here to
allow<00:01:15.229> the<00:01:15.290> arms<00:01:15.890> to<00:01:15.950> be<00:01:16.070> quite<00:01:16.340> free<00:01:16.930> and<00:01:17.930> easy

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
allow the arms to be quite free and easy

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.190 
allow the arms to be quite free and easy
to<00:01:18.350> move<00:01:18.970> the<00:01:19.970> next<00:01:20.330> thing<00:01:20.630> that<00:01:20.659> we<00:01:20.900> needed<00:01:21.080> to

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
to move the next thing that we needed to

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.160 
to move the next thing that we needed to

for dry cold conditions and as such a
few<00:01:33.020> companies<00:01:33.380> I<00:01:33.860> started<00:01:34.369> to<00:01:34.460> look<00:01:34.610> at<00:01:34.729> ways

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
few companies I started to look at ways

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.030 
few companies I started to look at ways
to<00:01:35.270> manage<00:01:35.720> moisture<00:01:36.259> build-up<00:01:36.590> in<00:01:36.770> in<00:01:36.950> the

it in the key areas in the jacket then

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.100 
it in the key areas in the jacket then
might<00:01:51.799> absorb<00:01:52.159> moisture<00:01:52.400> so<00:01:53.270> on<00:01:53.689> the<00:01:53.840> sleeves

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
might absorb moisture so on the sleeves

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.859 
might absorb moisture so on the sleeves
on<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.500> cuffs<00:01:55.060> on<00:01:56.060> the<00:01:56.210> shoulders<00:01:56.630> in<00:01:56.750> this

to<00:01:59.110> restrict<00:01:59.620> moisture<00:02:00.010> vapor<00:02:00.130> from<00:02:00.640> from

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
to restrict moisture vapor from from

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.180 
to restrict moisture vapor from from
breathing<00:02:01.180> out<00:02:01.330> and<00:02:01.840> what<00:02:02.650> that<00:02:02.800> does<00:02:02.950> is

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
breathing out and what that does is

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.100 
breathing out and what that does is
obviously<00:02:03.640> prevents<00:02:04.330> the<00:02:04.450> fed<00:02:04.810> had<00:02:04.960> been

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
obviously prevents the fed had been

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.279 
obviously prevents the fed had been
saturated<00:02:05.350> by<00:02:06.030> general<00:02:07.030> moisture<00:02:07.420> and<00:02:08.140> then

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
saturated by general moisture and then

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.950 
saturated by general moisture and then
there's<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:08.619> call<00:02:08.860> of<00:02:09.070> Gazette's<00:02:09.960> featured

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
there's the call of Gazette's featured

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.970 
arms we then taken a very unique way of
putting<00:02:22.270> this<00:02:22.420> jacket<00:02:22.750> together<00:02:22.870> which<00:02:23.860> is

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
putting this jacket together which is

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.400 
putting this jacket together which is
our<00:02:24.100> lightweight<00:02:24.820> construction<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:26.230> we're

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
our lightweight construction so we're

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.710 
our lightweight construction so we're
using<00:02:26.560> a<00:02:26.740> super<00:02:27.160> burly<00:02:27.370> 20<00:02:28.000> Danny<00:02:28.180> and<00:02:28.390> nylon

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
using a super burly 20 Danny and nylon

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.720 
using a super burly 20 Danny and nylon
face<00:02:28.900> fabric<00:02:29.110> and<00:02:29.860> we've<00:02:30.010> then<00:02:30.190> been<00:02:30.430> able<00:02:30.550> to

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
face fabric and we've then been able to

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.150 
face fabric and we've then been able to
build<00:02:31.209> the<00:02:31.390> jacket<00:02:31.720> so<00:02:31.870> really<00:02:32.620> light<00:02:32.830> by

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
build the jacket so really light by

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.850 
build the jacket so really light by
using<00:02:33.190> our<00:02:33.610> light<00:02:34.090> by<00:02:34.330> construction<00:02:34.810> that<00:02:35.650> is

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
using our light by construction that is

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.780 
using our light by construction that is
only<00:02:36.130> using<00:02:37.860> extra<00:02:38.860> material<00:02:39.340> to<00:02:39.370> build<00:02:39.610> in

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
only using extra material to build in

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.300 
only using extra material to build in
the<00:02:39.910> pocket<00:02:40.239> box<00:02:40.420> which<00:02:40.630> is<00:02:40.810> really<00:02:41.290> neat<00:02:42.070> and

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
the pocket box which is really neat and

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.620 
the pocket box which is really neat and
it's<00:02:42.670> actually<00:02:42.940> quite<00:02:43.150> hard<00:02:43.180> and

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
it's actually quite hard and

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.140 
it's actually quite hard and
labor-intensive<00:02:43.959> to<00:02:44.560> do<00:02:44.709> so<00:02:45.400> we've<00:02:45.910> managed

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
labor-intensive to do so we've managed

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.590 
labor-intensive to do so we've managed
to<00:02:46.180> take<00:02:46.480> out<00:02:47.040> extra<00:02:48.040> panels<00:02:48.489> of<00:02:48.880> fabric<00:02:48.910> from

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
to take out extra panels of fabric from

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.020 
to take out extra panels of fabric from
the<00:02:50.110> sides<00:02:50.350> here<00:02:50.800> the<00:02:50.950> back<00:02:51.190> and<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:51.880> other

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
the sides here the back and the other

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.140 
the sides here the back and the other
side<00:02:52.110> allowing<00:02:53.110> us<00:02:53.230> to<00:02:53.260> build<00:02:53.500> a<00:02:53.850> very<00:02:54.850> very

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
side allowing us to build a very very

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.430 
side allowing us to build a very very
light<00:02:55.450> very<00:02:55.810> very<00:02:56.590> durable<00:02:56.860> durable<00:02:57.310> and

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
light very very durable durable and

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.570 
light very very durable durable and
usable<00:02:59.440> jacket<00:02:59.830> that's<00:02:59.980> going<00:03:00.160> to<00:03:00.220> resist

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
usable jacket that's going to resist

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.539 
usable jacket that's going to resist
moisture<00:03:00.910> build-up<00:03:01.800> Masari<00:03:02.800> melty<00:03:03.220> is<00:03:03.340> down

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
moisture build-up Masari melty is down

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.220 
moisture build-up Masari melty is down
here<00:03:03.790> with<00:03:03.910> the<00:03:03.970> guys<00:03:04.120> in<00:03:04.299> Cardiff<00:03:04.630> and<00:03:04.810> it's

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
here with the guys in Cardiff and it's

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.519 
here with the guys in Cardiff and it's
come<00:03:06.100> and<00:03:06.220> try<00:03:06.340> it<00:03:06.400> out
