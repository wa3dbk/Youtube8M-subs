 episode 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.580

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.610
 one of the music that has helped me the most 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.490
 liked bowling are sonic islands 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.370
 unleashed the screens gave gusts of 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.950
 speed are among the best I've ever 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:57.670
 seen me in the modern sonic are very 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.080
 good got nothing we're not telling you 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.420
 it's harder to get it is in the 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.150
 screens here but good as this one 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.659
 it's short I'll show you how it is 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.000
 organized the project analysis 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.890
 and I repeat this is done by the fans 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.080
 I'm made by a group of people 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.610
 a group of mother's that have modified 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.030
 worth the sonic redundancy 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.250
 generations to do remastered I've 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.670
 modified at the level of texturing and 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.459
 others each one of the ga screens 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.319
 Special list how is the 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.410
 world as well as in sonic generations 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.150
 but they have adapted it completely with 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.849
 the musics that are original and sometimes 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.080
 even remixes okay let's go go 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:41.820
 for each of them 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.820
 we are not right, great for example 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:51.180
 we thought about fixing is that donkey has this 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.430
 It is an authentic past each and every one 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.510
 of the day screens of the sonic 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.250
 unleashed that are really the ones that 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.720
 they are worth it, I already told you 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.820
 some video what are they and andris for me 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.590
 the good thing I had were the screens 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.780
 gave more but the body seemed like a 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.350
 disaster I never liked I never got to 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.090

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.210
 credits so you can see who 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.880
