00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.769 
bait is put too many in a well you can't
overload<00:00:29.950> your<00:00:30.220> well<00:00:30.430> if<00:00:30.910> you<00:00:31.060> do<00:00:31.270> they're<00:00:31.750> not

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:33.210 
overload your well if you do they're not
gonna<00:00:31.930> get<00:00:32.140> enough<00:00:32.320> oxygen<00:00:32.529> they're<00:00:33.100> not

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.220 
gonna get enough oxygen they're not

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.350 
gonna get enough oxygen they're not
gonna<00:00:33.399> thrive<00:00:33.730> and<00:00:33.910> they're<00:00:34.030> not<00:00:34.120> gonna<00:00:34.270> be

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
gonna thrive and they're not gonna be

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.330 
gonna thrive and they're not gonna be
fresh<00:00:34.690> when<00:00:34.930> you<00:00:34.989> throw<00:00:35.230> them<00:00:35.380> out<00:00:35.470> there<00:00:35.680> for

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
fresh when you throw them out there for

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.310 
fresh when you throw them out there for
a<00:00:36.370> fish<00:00:36.610> to<00:00:36.760> eat<00:00:36.790> and<00:00:37.180> it<00:00:37.570> won't<00:00:37.750> work<00:00:37.899> as<00:00:38.110> well

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
a fish to eat and it won't work as well

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.130 
a fish to eat and it won't work as well
so<00:00:38.829> don't<00:00:39.820> overload<00:00:40.360> the<00:00:40.420> well<00:00:40.719> it's

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
so don't overload the well it's

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.870 
so don't overload the well it's
everybody's<00:00:41.829> tendency<00:00:42.309> to<00:00:42.430> want<00:00:42.580> to<00:00:42.610> put<00:00:42.790> as

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:42.880 
everybody's tendency to want to put as

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.670 
everybody's tendency to want to put as
many<00:00:43.060> as<00:00:43.180> possible<00:00:43.300> cram<00:00:43.990> them<00:00:44.170> all<00:00:44.290> in<00:00:44.500> there

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
many as possible cram them all in there

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.590 
many as possible cram them all in there
so<00:00:44.830> there's<00:00:45.010> more<00:00:45.160> fish<00:00:45.460> flesh<00:00:45.790> than<00:00:46.060> water<00:00:46.360> in

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
so there's more fish flesh than water in

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.140 
so there's more fish flesh than water in
the<00:00:46.690> well<00:00:46.840> it's<00:00:47.410> not<00:00:47.530> a<00:00:47.590> good<00:00:47.830> idea<00:00:48.010> and<00:00:48.460> the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.150 
the well it's not a good idea and the

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.520 
the well it's not a good idea and the
only<00:00:49.360> way<00:00:49.480> you<00:00:49.540> know<00:00:49.660> how<00:00:49.990> much<00:00:50.170> your<00:00:50.350> well

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
only way you know how much your well

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.650 
only way you know how much your well
will<00:00:50.740> hold<00:00:50.980> is<00:00:51.220> through<00:00:51.430> trial<00:00:51.790> and<00:00:51.940> error<00:00:52.150> but

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
will hold is through trial and error but

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.600 
will hold is through trial and error but
make<00:00:53.230> sure<00:00:53.440> that<00:00:53.530> your<00:00:53.680> well<00:00:53.800> has<00:00:53.980> a<00:00:54.010> good<00:00:54.310> flow

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
make sure that your well has a good flow

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.730 
make sure that your well has a good flow
good<00:00:55.120> circulation<00:00:55.420> there's<00:00:56.020> no<00:00:56.170> dead<00:00:56.440> zones

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:56.740 
good circulation there's no dead zones

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.130 
good circulation there's no dead zones
in<00:00:56.980> the<00:00:57.100> well<00:00:57.280> and<00:00:57.520> that<00:00:57.940> it<00:00:58.030> properly<00:00:58.720> drains

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
in the well and that it properly drains

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.050 
in the well and that it properly drains
as<00:00:59.470> well<00:00:59.770> that's<00:01:00.100> a<00:01:00.250> big<00:01:00.460> problem<00:01:00.820> because<00:01:00.940> a

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:01.060 
as well that's a big problem because a

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.810 
as well that's a big problem because a
lot<00:01:01.240> of<00:01:01.270> wells<00:01:01.540> overload<00:01:02.170> overflow<00:01:02.950> and<00:01:03.550> can

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
lot of wells overload overflow and can

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.490 
lot of wells overload overflow and can
cause<00:01:03.970> safety<00:01:04.269> hazards<00:01:04.809> as<00:01:04.930> well<00:01:05.110> as<00:01:05.259> killing

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
cause safety hazards as well as killing

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.260 
cause safety hazards as well as killing
your<00:01:05.680> bass<00:01:05.860> so<00:01:06.130> make<00:01:06.759> sure<00:01:06.790> that<00:01:07.000> you<00:01:07.119> well

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
your bass so make sure that you well

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.359 
your bass so make sure that you well
operates<00:01:07.780> properly<00:01:08.290> because<00:01:08.439> a<00:01:08.590> fresh<00:01:09.009> live

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
operates properly because a fresh live

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.429 
operates properly because a fresh live
bait<00:01:09.700> is<00:01:10.149> about<00:01:10.450> as<00:01:10.600> good<00:01:10.750> as<00:01:10.899> it<00:01:11.020> gets<00:01:11.170> in

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:11.439 
bait is about as good as it gets in

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:13.050 
bait is about as good as it gets in
terms<00:01:11.500> of<00:01:12.070> effectiveness<00:01:12.549> when<00:01:12.820> fishing
