00:01:11.419 --> 00:01:11.429 
bottle is a hundred milliliters and I

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:14.209 
bottle is a hundred milliliters and I
think<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.789> was<00:01:11.909> around<00:01:12.299> eleven<00:01:13.200> dollars<00:01:13.590> so

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:14.219 
think it was around eleven dollars so

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:18.319 
think it was around eleven dollars so
this<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.509> lot<00:01:15.899> cheaper<00:01:15.929> than<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.700> Moroccan

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:18.329 
this is a lot cheaper than the Moroccan

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:20.419 
this is a lot cheaper than the Moroccan
oil<00:01:18.450> treatment<00:01:19.020> which<00:01:19.229> can<00:01:19.530> be<00:01:19.799> up<00:01:20.039> in<00:01:20.219> the

00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:20.429 
oil treatment which can be up in the

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:25.419 
oil treatment which can be up in the
fifty<00:01:20.939> dollar<00:01:21.119> range<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.630> think<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:23.240> for<00:01:24.240> me

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:25.429 
fifty dollar range I think and for me

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:28.700 
fifty dollar range I think and for me
this<00:01:26.429> has<00:01:26.880> been<00:01:26.909> working<00:01:27.509> really<00:01:27.960> well<00:01:28.140> for<00:01:28.499> me

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
definitely put it just on the ends if I

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.330
