00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 good morning friends youtube writers 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.960
 we can do the unboxing to two 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.410
 products guys the single clip four 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.450
 lenses in one and the macro lenses that are 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.280
 three glasses none so we go with the 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.280
 logo and let's start with the video 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.480
 a little nostalgic with this device 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.880
 because this was certainly one of the 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.260
 first devices that I did the 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.300
 unboxing after iphone 4s this 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.520
 I bought it in December 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.920
 from the 2011 version the first version 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.010
 clear that this is not the same but I 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.070
 very good agreement of this company and the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.440
 use that I gave to this one or what I 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.449
 I remember that I did a contest for now 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.329
 I do not know honestly I do not know if I'm going to do 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:53.610
 the contest because I need these lenses 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.880
 for my iphone I think I'm going to give them a 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.620
 very very good use both the macro and the 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.930
 piss one so let's do 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.480

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.030

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.310
 let's see how the box comes 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.509
 has nothing else does not have stickers of 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.310
 this side this company is very original 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.830

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.979
 with a cover that's something different comes 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.930
 with this casing that is for quick use 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.600
 you can have your clear casing that I 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.670
 I ordered white for the golden iphone look 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.560
 Here come different colors you can 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.680

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:52.819
 long boxing to the other the macro lens and 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:57.349

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:59.510
 is 7 14 and 21 this one also has the 4 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:03.170
 people draw one of 15 and one of 10 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:06.769
 he has 7 14 and 21 what he gives you here 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.920
 a little explanation are boxing 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:12.500
 quickie this is the new guys here 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.930
 is the one behind it is not so new but 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.090
 this one is the new look here does not bring 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.890
 young man this one does not bring cover this one that 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.150
 use it like that at least when you go 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.670
 to use is not that you're going to have 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.720
 without cover devices also it is not 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.690
 so difficult 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:31.000
 cover is where you come what you are going to 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:34.760
 use come there can see what brings three 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.480
 more accessories and the lens from the 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:41.240
 gets 20 on 20 of 21 and on this side 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.640
 has the 14 I imagine and if you 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:47.600
 we remove the one side or not if you 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.430
 we put this let's have the 14 and 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.980
 7 at the same time so let me see 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.110
 how is it that I can give them the 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.060
 the test to show from each photo of 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.560
 each of the lenses as you can see 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.630
 I have here that look like they are two 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.330
 really lenses around here this one only 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.700
 There are four lenses in one and these are 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.240
 three lenses in one the macro then 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:11.000
 here I will present first the 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:14.030
 bailÃ©n the one who makes the angle as 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.269
 open look at 9 and how are you are the 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:19.190
 photos that you can capture if you take it off 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.739
 the lens here below true of 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.380
 remove this and there automatically 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:27.290
 you will have the macrolane of 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.210
 It is X and those are the photos that you 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.580
 you can capture for the next 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.250
 you just have to use it from the side 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.860
 reverse and there you will be using in the end there 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.170
 the fish eye there you can see 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:43.730
 the photos that can be taken with this 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:47.150
 and if we remove it there we have the macro of 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:49.880
 15 times the one that is 15 times and now 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:53.410
 let's try the other two photos 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:56.750
 that can be taken with the macro is 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:05:00.770
 21 and we flip him we have the macro lens 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:03.680
 of 14 and if we take away this part of 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.110
 here although we leave connected of that 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.870
 same side now if we remove this 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:13.340
 part of here we will be seeing what is 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:16.520
 the macro link of 77 times and those are the 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.680
 photos that can be taken I hope that the 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.540
 photos that I am showing you like 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.090
