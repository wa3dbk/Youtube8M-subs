00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
so that means air drying your hair

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.190 
so that means air drying your hair
instead<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:40.950> blow-drying<00:01:41.310> your<00:01:41.430> hair<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:42.200> not

using heat styling tools but if you must
I<00:01:46.110> would<00:01:46.320> recommend<00:01:46.710> using<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:47.189> on<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.670> low<00:01:47.970> heat

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
for added protection use a heat

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.440 
for added protection use a heat
protectant<00:01:53.280> something<00:01:53.850> like<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:54.119> it

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
protectant something like this it

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.330
