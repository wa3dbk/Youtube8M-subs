this is originally anodized anodizing is

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.680 
this is originally anodized anodizing is
a<00:00:34.570> kind<00:00:34.899> of<00:00:35.020> treatment<00:00:35.469> where<00:00:35.649> an<00:00:36.399> aluminium

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.270 
part is put in a bath hooked up to wires
it's<00:00:40.660> a<00:00:40.750> special<00:00:41.110> kind<00:00:41.320> of<00:00:41.410> chemical<00:00:41.860> bath<00:00:42.040> and

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
it's a special kind of chemical bath and

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.360 
it's a special kind of chemical bath and
there's<00:00:42.490> a<00:00:42.550> sort<00:00:42.730> of<00:00:42.790> a<00:00:42.880> controlled

there's a sort of a controlled
electrochemical<00:00:45.370> corrosion<00:00:45.550> goes<00:00:46.150> on<00:00:46.420> so<00:00:47.170> the

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
electrochemical corrosion goes on so the

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.080 
electrochemical corrosion goes on so the
anodizing<00:00:47.530> layer<00:00:48.100> that<00:00:48.280> you<00:00:48.430> get<00:00:48.670> is<00:00:48.910> actually

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
anodizing layer that you get is actually

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.650 
anodizing layer that you get is actually
a<00:00:49.570> layer<00:00:50.230> of<00:00:50.530> hard<00:00:50.860> corrosion<00:00:51.700> that<00:00:51.730> forms<00:00:52.420> on

a layer of hard corrosion that forms on

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.229 
a layer of hard corrosion that forms on

top of the metal which is what's been
done<00:00:55.390> with<00:00:55.540> this<00:00:55.660> but<00:00:55.870> unfortunately<00:00:56.530> it

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:57.310 
done with this but unfortunately it

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.670 
done with this but unfortunately it
doesn't<00:00:57.700> last<00:00:57.850> forever<00:00:58.559> eventually<00:00:59.559> the

doesn't last forever eventually the

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.020 
doesn't last forever eventually the
weather<00:00:59.860> will<00:01:00.040> get<00:01:00.190> to<00:01:00.370> it<00:01:00.460> depending<00:01:00.850> on<00:01:00.910> the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
weather will get to it depending on the

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.940 
weather will get to it depending on the
conditions<00:01:01.450> as<00:01:01.570> it<00:01:01.600> gets<00:01:01.989> exposed<00:01:02.440> to

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
conditions as it gets exposed to

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.740 
conditions as it gets exposed to
you'll<00:01:03.190> see<00:01:03.399> coloured<00:01:03.790> anodizing<00:01:04.420> as<00:01:04.540> well

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
you'll see coloured anodizing as well

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.209 
you'll see coloured anodizing as well
something<00:01:05.229> might<00:01:05.350> be<00:01:05.439> colored<00:01:05.710> yellow<00:01:05.890> or

00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:06.219 
something might be colored yellow or

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:07.889 
something might be colored yellow or
purple<00:01:06.399> or<00:01:06.670> red<00:01:06.700> because<00:01:07.329> in<00:01:07.540> conjunction

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:07.899 
purple or red because in conjunction

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:10.499 
purple or red because in conjunction
with<00:01:08.200> that<00:01:08.229> process<00:01:08.799> you<00:01:09.040> can<00:01:09.219> add<00:01:09.310> a<00:01:09.340> dye<00:01:09.640> now

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:10.509 
with that process you can add a dye now

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:12.570 
with that process you can add a dye now
I<00:01:10.570> am<00:01:10.869> going<00:01:11.020> to<00:01:11.079> either<00:01:11.229> try<00:01:12.159> and<00:01:12.190> bring<00:01:12.460> this

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
I am going to either try and bring this

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.789 
I am going to either try and bring this
back<00:01:12.640> to<00:01:12.880> that<00:01:13.090> sort<00:01:13.390> of<00:01:13.510> brushed<00:01:13.840> aluminium

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
back to that sort of brushed aluminium

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:16.830 
back to that sort of brushed aluminium
finish<00:01:15.610> that<00:01:15.790> you<00:01:15.850> can<00:01:15.970> see<00:01:16.150> some<00:01:16.360> remnant<00:01:16.780> of

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
finish that you can see some remnant of

finish that you can see some remnant of
there<00:01:17.290> or<00:01:17.530> I'm<00:01:18.100> going<00:01:18.340> to<00:01:18.370> actually<00:01:18.700> paint<00:01:18.970> it

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
there or I'm going to actually paint it

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.140 
there or I'm going to actually paint it
a<00:01:19.299> color<00:01:19.630> because<00:01:20.620> I'm<00:01:20.799> not<00:01:20.950> confident<00:01:21.520> at<00:01:21.700> the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
a color because I'm not confident at the

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.490 
a color because I'm not confident at the
moment<00:01:22.600> that<00:01:22.690> I<00:01:22.750> can<00:01:22.810> bring<00:01:23.049> it<00:01:23.170> back<00:01:23.320> to<00:01:23.470> a

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
moment that I can bring it back to a

moment that I can bring it back to a
finish<00:01:23.770> that's<00:01:23.979> worse

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
finish that's worse

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.859

worth<00:01:24.490> preserving<00:01:24.880> here<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:26.500> can<00:01:26.680> see<00:01:27.869> where

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
worth preserving here you can see where

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.020 
worth preserving here you can see where
I've<00:01:28.960> applied<00:01:29.290> something<00:01:29.979> that<00:01:30.580> stripped<00:01:30.880> off

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
I've applied something that stripped off

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.490 
I've applied something that stripped off
the<00:01:31.150> anodizing<00:01:31.360> that<00:01:31.720> I've<00:01:31.810> polished<00:01:32.049> it<00:01:32.380> with

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
the anodizing that I've polished it with

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.320 
the anodizing that I've polished it with
something<00:01:32.710> called<00:01:32.830> a<00:01:33.040> flap<00:01:33.310> wheel<00:01:33.549> which<00:01:34.119> I'll

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
something called a flap wheel which I'll

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.929 
something called a flap wheel which I'll
show<00:01:34.479> you<00:01:34.510> later<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.890> I<00:01:35.950> did<00:01:36.190> manage<00:01:36.490> to<00:01:36.520> strip

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
show you later and I did manage to strip

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:39.660 
show you later and I did manage to strip
off<00:01:37.119> strip<00:01:37.990> it<00:01:38.140> back<00:01:38.830> to<00:01:39.010> a<00:01:39.070> fairly<00:01:39.430> rough

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
off strip it back to a fairly rough

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.670 
off strip it back to a fairly rough
surface<00:01:40.180> this<00:01:40.630> is<00:01:40.780> another<00:01:41.020> bit<00:01:41.229> that<00:01:41.350> I<00:01:41.409> tried

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
surface this is another bit that I tried

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.830 
surface this is another bit that I tried
with<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:41.979> anodizing<00:01:42.189> still<00:01:42.760> on<00:01:42.939> and<00:01:43.180> really

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
with the anodizing still on and really

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.050 
with the anodizing still on and really
didn't<00:01:44.110> make<00:01:44.290> much<00:01:44.350> progress<00:01:45.310> with<00:01:45.729> the<00:01:45.850> flap

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
didn't make much progress with the flap

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.609 
didn't make much progress with the flap
wheel<00:01:46.270> what<00:01:46.930> I'm<00:01:47.020> going<00:01:47.170> to<00:01:47.200> be<00:01:47.290> using<00:01:47.409> to

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.210 
aluminium reacts with caustic soda
sodium<00:01:54.729> hydroxide<00:01:55.330> this<00:01:56.320> is<00:01:56.530> obviously<00:01:57.009> a<00:01:57.100> bit

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
sodium hydroxide this is obviously a bit

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.060 
sodium hydroxide this is obviously a bit
milder<00:01:57.490> than<00:01:57.820> using<00:01:58.180> pure<00:01:58.570> caustic<00:01:58.990> soda<00:01:59.200> but

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
milder than using pure caustic soda but

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.410 
milder than using pure caustic soda but
you<00:02:00.310> still<00:02:00.490> got<00:02:00.610> to<00:02:00.640> be<00:02:00.729> careful<00:02:01.150> and<00:02:01.299> you<00:02:01.390> I

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
you still got to be careful and you I

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.850 
you still got to be careful and you I
wouldn't<00:02:01.840> leave<00:02:01.990> it<00:02:02.110> on<00:02:02.170> for<00:02:02.229> more<00:02:02.530> than<00:02:02.680> 10

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
wouldn't leave it on for more than 10

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.950 
wouldn't leave it on for more than 10
minutes<00:02:03.070> you<00:02:03.400> wouldn't<00:02:03.880> do<00:02:03.939> this<00:02:04.119> indoors<00:02:04.540> and

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
minutes you wouldn't do this indoors and

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.109 
minutes you wouldn't do this indoors and
if<00:02:05.380> you<00:02:05.470> if<00:02:05.740> you're<00:02:05.950> using<00:02:05.979> oven<00:02:06.520> cleaner<00:02:06.790> in

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
if you if you're using oven cleaner in

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:08.910 
if you if you're using oven cleaner in
an<00:02:07.329> oven<00:02:07.600> wear<00:02:07.869> gloves<00:02:08.079> and<00:02:08.379> all<00:02:08.439> that<00:02:08.619> sort<00:02:08.860> of

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
an oven wear gloves and all that sort of

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.229 
an oven wear gloves and all that sort of
stuff<00:02:09.129> but<00:02:09.159> I'm<00:02:09.399> just<00:02:09.579> going<00:02:09.729> to<00:02:09.759> do<00:02:10.000> it<00:02:10.030> out

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
stuff but I'm just going to do it out

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:19.610 
stuff but I'm just going to do it out
here<00:02:10.479> and<00:02:10.599> keep<00:02:10.899> my<00:02:11.019> distance

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.089 

you

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
you

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.739 
you
so<00:02:21.249> that's<00:02:21.400> at<00:02:21.549> 15<00:02:21.969> minutes<00:02:22.150> now<00:02:22.359> actually<00:02:22.719> I

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:22.749 
so that's at 15 minutes now actually I

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:24.119 
so that's at 15 minutes now actually I
was<00:02:22.870> feeling<00:02:23.140> a<00:02:23.200> bit<00:02:23.319> gung-ho<00:02:23.560> it<00:02:23.859> didn't<00:02:24.069> look

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
was feeling a bit gung-ho it didn't look

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:25.559 
was feeling a bit gung-ho it didn't look
like<00:02:24.219> it<00:02:24.340> was<00:02:24.489> bubbling<00:02:24.909> radically<00:02:25.420> or

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
like it was bubbling radically or

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.629 
like it was bubbling radically or
attacking<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.109> middle<00:02:26.349> in<00:02:26.439> any<00:02:26.620> severe<00:02:27.400> way

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:27.639 
attacking the middle in any severe way

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:29.009 
attacking the middle in any severe way
so<00:02:27.700> now<00:02:28.120> I'm<00:02:28.209> just<00:02:28.269> going<00:02:28.420> to<00:02:28.540> hose<00:02:28.659> all<00:02:28.870> that

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
so now I'm just going to hose all that

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:30.869 
so now I'm just going to hose all that
off<00:02:29.170> when<00:02:29.560> you<00:02:29.680> do<00:02:29.829> this<00:02:30.040> you<00:02:30.219> might<00:02:30.400> find<00:02:30.730> that

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
off when you do this you might find that

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.179 
off when you do this you might find that
your<00:02:31.060> medal<00:02:31.299> actually<00:02:31.659> even<00:02:31.900> goes<00:02:32.049> black<00:02:32.530> you

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:33.189 
your medal actually even goes black you

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:35.009 
your medal actually even goes black you
can<00:02:33.370> see<00:02:33.549> that<00:02:33.700> bit<00:02:33.879> that<00:02:34.060> I<00:02:34.150> felt<00:02:34.599> polished<00:02:34.959> a

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
can see that bit that I felt polished a

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.140 
can see that bit that I felt polished a
bit<00:02:35.139> that<00:02:35.319> I<00:02:35.379> showed<00:02:35.620> you<00:02:35.739> before<00:02:35.859> has<00:02:36.849> been<00:02:37.030> as

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
bit that I showed you before has been as

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.940 
bit that I showed you before has been as
being<00:02:37.569> kind<00:02:37.810> of<00:02:37.930> attacked<00:02:38.290> by<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:38.620> the

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
being kind of attacked by the the

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.530 
being kind of attacked by the the
caustic<00:02:39.849> and<00:02:40.000> it<00:02:40.060> sort<00:02:40.329> of<00:02:40.359> is<00:02:40.510> black<00:02:42.480> okay<00:02:43.480> so

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
caustic and it sort of is black okay so

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.509 
caustic and it sort of is black okay so
a<00:02:43.719> couple<00:02:43.930> of<00:02:44.049> days<00:02:44.170> later<00:02:44.469> here's<00:02:44.859> my<00:02:45.099> front

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
a couple of days later here's my front

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.539 
a couple of days later here's my front
subframe<00:02:45.819> it's<00:02:46.420> gone<00:02:46.870> a<00:02:47.230> kind<00:02:47.919> of<00:02:48.040> a<00:02:48.099> chalky

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
subframe it's gone a kind of a chalky

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.580 
subframe it's gone a kind of a chalky
white<00:02:48.760> where<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.599> oven<00:02:49.810> clean<00:02:50.049> has<00:02:50.200> been<00:02:50.409> on

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
white where the oven clean has been on

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.949 
white where the oven clean has been on
it<00:02:50.709> this<00:02:51.340> is<00:02:51.519> called<00:02:51.760> a<00:02:51.999> flap<00:02:52.329> wheel<00:02:52.540> it's<00:02:52.900> a

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
it this is called a flap wheel it's a

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.470 
it this is called a flap wheel it's a
bunch<00:02:53.169> of<00:02:53.319> square<00:02:53.919> leaves<00:02:54.250> of<00:02:54.609> 80<00:02:54.939> grit<00:02:55.239> in

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
bunch of square leaves of 80 grit in

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.420 
bunch of square leaves of 80 grit in
this<00:02:55.750> case<00:02:56.019> a<00:02:56.290> red<00:02:57.129> oxide<00:02:57.489> type<00:02:58.209> sandpaper

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
this case a red oxide type sandpaper

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.030 
this case a red oxide type sandpaper
bonded<00:03:00.569> onto<00:03:01.569> a<00:03:01.750> shaft<00:03:02.019> which<00:03:02.530> you<00:03:02.650> can<00:03:02.769> put<00:03:02.949> in

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
bonded onto a shaft which you can put in

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.069 
bonded onto a shaft which you can put in
your<00:03:03.129> drill<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:03.909> leaves<00:03:04.150> actually<00:03:04.389> Bend<00:03:04.840> as

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
your drill the leaves actually Bend as

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:08.520 
your drill the leaves actually Bend as
you<00:03:05.560> go<00:03:05.769> so<00:03:06.760> that<00:03:06.790> it's<00:03:07.359> not<00:03:07.540> rigid<00:03:07.810> in<00:03:08.109> and<00:03:08.409> a

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
you go so that it's not rigid in and a

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.709 
you go so that it's not rigid in and a
little<00:03:08.889> difference<00:03:09.489> in<00:03:09.609> pressure<00:03:09.909> isn't

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:10.719 
little difference in pressure isn't

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:12.179 
little difference in pressure isn't
going<00:03:10.930> to<00:03:11.019> make<00:03:11.079> a<00:03:11.139> huge<00:03:11.500> difference<00:03:11.919> to<00:03:12.069> how

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:12.189 
going to make a huge difference to how

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:13.949 
going to make a huge difference to how
much<00:03:12.370> you<00:03:12.519> actually<00:03:12.699> cut<00:03:13.269> into<00:03:13.419> the<00:03:13.599> metal<00:03:13.870> or

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
much you actually cut into the metal or

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.390 
much you actually cut into the metal or
anything<00:03:14.139> like<00:03:14.379> that<00:03:14.409> not<00:03:14.620> with<00:03:14.799> a<00:03:14.829> rigid

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
anything like that not with a rigid

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.819 
anything like that not with a rigid
wheel<00:03:16.150> on<00:03:16.359> a<00:03:16.389> grinder<00:03:16.719> where<00:03:17.109> you<00:03:17.560> put<00:03:17.709> too

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
wheel on a grinder where you put too

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:18.899 
wheel on a grinder where you put too
much<00:03:17.859> pressure<00:03:18.219> on<00:03:18.400> you're<00:03:18.549> going<00:03:18.669> to<00:03:18.730> dig

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:18.909 
much pressure on you're going to dig

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:37.440 
much pressure on you're going to dig
straight<00:03:19.209> in

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.610 

so<00:03:38.450> there<00:03:38.599> we<00:03:38.690> go<00:03:38.720> I've<00:03:39.050> probably<00:03:39.230> spent<00:03:39.470> an

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
so there we go I've probably spent an

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.400 
so there we go I've probably spent an
hour<00:03:39.739> hour<00:03:40.220> and<00:03:40.520> a<00:03:40.550> half<00:03:40.730> on<00:03:40.970> that<00:03:41.180> to<00:03:42.080> get<00:03:42.200> into

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
hour hour and a half on that to get into

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.690 
hour hour and a half on that to get into
some<00:03:42.560> of<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:42.709> really<00:03:42.980> tricky<00:03:43.160> spots<00:03:43.550> I'm

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
some of the really tricky spots I'm

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.430 
some of the really tricky spots I'm
afraid<00:03:44.000> I<00:03:44.030> had<00:03:44.239> to<00:03:44.330> resort<00:03:44.630> to<00:03:44.720> the<00:03:44.930> wire<00:03:45.110> wheel

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
afraid I had to resort to the wire wheel

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.530 
afraid I had to resort to the wire wheel
which<00:03:45.709> is<00:03:45.890> not<00:03:46.760> something<00:03:46.910> I<00:03:47.060> really<00:03:47.330> wanted

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
which is not something I really wanted

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.449 
which is not something I really wanted
to<00:03:47.599> do<00:03:47.780> because<00:03:47.930> it<00:03:48.200> has<00:03:48.560> a<00:03:48.590> tendency<00:03:48.680> to<00:03:49.160> gouge

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
to do because it has a tendency to gouge

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:50.949 
to do because it has a tendency to gouge
at<00:03:49.819> the<00:03:49.940> aluminium<00:03:50.120> but<00:03:50.540> there<00:03:50.720> are<00:03:50.780> a<00:03:50.810> couple

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
at the aluminium but there are a couple

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.220 
at the aluminium but there are a couple

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
of spots like around here right I kind

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.199 
of spots like around here right I kind
of<00:03:54.349> just<00:03:54.470> had<00:03:54.650> to<00:03:54.830> use<00:03:55.010> it<00:03:55.220> I'd<00:03:55.610> like<00:03:55.849> to<00:03:56.060> polish

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
of just had to use it I'd like to polish

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:57.640 
of just had to use it I'd like to polish
it<00:03:56.360> back<00:03:56.569> to<00:03:56.720> a<00:03:56.750> satin<00:03:57.019> finish<00:03:57.170> and<00:03:57.319> then<00:03:57.470> coat

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
it with clear but I don't think it's

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.160 
it with clear but I don't think it's
going<00:03:59.090> to<00:03:59.150> look<00:03:59.269> very<00:03:59.330> good<00:03:59.569> if<00:03:59.810> you<00:03:59.900> do<00:04:00.019> that

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
going to look very good if you do that

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.660 
going to look very good if you do that
it's<00:04:00.349> going<00:04:00.440> to<00:04:00.500> look<00:04:00.590> a<00:04:00.680> bit<00:04:00.709> homemade<00:04:01.220> so<00:04:01.610> I'm

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
it's going to look a bit homemade so I'm

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.280
