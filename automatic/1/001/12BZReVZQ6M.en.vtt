00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.860
 this maximum and today we find ourselves 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.900
 for a little tutorial of minecraft so 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.180
 of course how was it carried in 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.010
 minecraft then flies for those ci 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.980
 it's very simple you will need some 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.559
 young rpr whose cooking their father is doing 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.080
 find by killing erman men like 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.660
 these good risks and the doors 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:51.720
 so when you 'll like you normal 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:54.810
 and well you will fall on her so in 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:58.020
 French if the pearl of nothingness 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:00.300
 so so actually this little thing we're going 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.979
 serve you to teleport you so you 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:07.320
 make a right click so in survival 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.050
 sorry is actually so it's okay 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.330
 teleport then I will show you that 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.580
 everything is so then it is very useful 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.800
 when one is in survival then you do 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.030
 a right click and so it launches it to you 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.149
 so this you to lens if you make a 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.860
 right click like these and will have to terry 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.799
 did you actually lose two points of 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.900
 life then have to be careful because 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.670
 sometimes still die but hey it's 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.350
 very very handy because if you 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.870
 are pursued by a spider by 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.910
 example he advanced to very high you 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.740
 and if you want you are not 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:46.890
 your city you can launch it too 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:48.360
 like these a year right there and that's it 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.330
 so you're going to land in your 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.310
 city ​​so like this here I am 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:59.310
 in my castle I burst a 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:02.610
 little in creative then so then so 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.900
 if you are very very very very long and 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.730
 that you can not essence peace 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:10.530
 relaunched and will go like that 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:12.930
 by just losing life then the 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.840
 other points the other points so 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.990
 honestly I love this thing because 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.950
 that we can teleport 126 it's 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.350
 just awesome 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.190
 so we can teleport a little 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:29.850
 everywhere up dac end 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:32.750
 cc yes also something so if for example 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:36.090
 you are I do not know pursued by 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:40.200
 something again and that you have 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.900
 kind just a cumulation here could come 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.420
 so next hop you do that and you 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.480
 interest in it and the pursuer does 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.150
 can not go home that's great too 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.650
 my body 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.010
 that's about all I have to say 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:58.489
 on pearl smells so to you 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:01.190
 advise to use them it's just 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:04.730
 great is 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:08.510
