00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.050 
that that deal is depending on is that
he<00:04:25.560> gets<00:04:25.740> the<00:04:25.860> work<00:04:26.009> of<00:04:26.190> Brendan<00:04:26.490> Rodgers<00:04:26.639> and

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
he gets the work of Brendan Rodgers and

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.670 
he gets the work of Brendan Rodgers and
obviously<00:04:27.389> if<00:04:27.509> Brendan<00:04:27.750> Rodgers<00:04:27.870> leaves<00:04:28.229> so

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
obviously if Brendan Rodgers leaves so

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.499 
obviously if Brendan Rodgers leaves so
good<00:04:28.860> some<00:04:29.070> might<00:04:29.220> not<00:04:29.370> think<00:04:29.669> the<00:04:29.820> Swansea<00:04:30.240> is

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:30.509 
good some might not think the Swansea is

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:32.450 
good some might not think the Swansea is
an<00:04:30.840> attractive<00:04:31.289> and<00:04:31.410> option<00:04:31.770> maybe<00:04:32.160> he'll<00:04:32.340> end

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
an attractive and option maybe he'll end

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.370 
an attractive and option maybe he'll end
up<00:04:32.520> going<00:04:32.759> to<00:04:32.850> Liverpool<00:04:33.240> interesting<00:04:34.199> I

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
up going to Liverpool interesting I

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.230 
up going to Liverpool interesting I
think<00:04:34.889> what<00:04:35.190> will<00:04:35.280> have<00:04:35.400> a<00:04:35.430> large<00:04:35.699> impact<00:04:36.060> on

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
think what will have a large impact on

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.300 
think what will have a large impact on
Brendan<00:04:36.600> Rodgers<00:04:36.750> his<00:04:36.990> success<00:04:37.470> at<00:04:37.860> Liverpool

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
Brendan Rodgers his success at Liverpool

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.550 
Brendan Rodgers his success at Liverpool
will<00:04:38.729> be<00:04:38.850> won<00:04:39.030> how<00:04:39.419> we<00:04:39.479> react<00:04:39.870> to<00:04:39.960> the<00:04:40.229> the<00:04:40.410> old

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
Carragher and Gerrard is very important

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.680 
Carragher and Gerrard is very important
he<00:04:43.800> gets<00:04:43.979> them<00:04:44.160> on<00:04:44.190> board<00:04:44.520> also<00:04:45.030> be<00:04:45.330> great<00:04:45.570> to

see what he does with the signings who

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.580 
see what he does with the signings who
Dalgleish<00:04:47.970> made<00:04:48.240> that<00:04:48.720> weren't<00:04:48.960> deemed<00:04:49.259> to<00:04:49.410> be

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
Dalgleish made that weren't deemed to be

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.010 
Dalgleish made that weren't deemed to be
too<00:04:50.009> successful<00:04:50.250> Stewart<00:04:51.090> Downing<00:04:51.210> Jordan

a<00:04:54.479> lot<00:04:54.630> of<00:04:54.720> money's<00:04:54.930> been<00:04:55.050> spent<00:04:55.080> on<00:04:55.350> these

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
a lot of money's been spent on these

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.110 
a lot of money's been spent on these
guys<00:04:55.710> and<00:04:56.010> they<00:04:56.130> don't<00:04:56.310> really<00:04:56.550> seem<00:04:56.850> to<00:04:57.000> have

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
guys and they don't really seem to have

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.300 
guys and they don't really seem to have
paid<00:04:57.630> that<00:04:57.810> money<00:04:57.960> back<00:04:58.229> yet<00:04:58.500> in<00:04:58.650> performances

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
paid that money back yet in performances

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.040 
paid that money back yet in performances
so<00:04:59.850> we<00:05:00.090> know<00:05:00.210> that<00:05:00.240> Rodgers<00:05:00.630> is<00:05:00.750> one<00:05:00.900> of<00:05:00.990> the

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
so we know that Rodgers is one of the

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.840 
so we know that Rodgers is one of the
least<00:05:01.260> experienced<00:05:01.860> managers<00:05:02.280> on<00:05:02.430> the<00:05:02.490> list

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
least experienced managers on the list

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.610 
least experienced managers on the list
Liverpool<00:05:03.270> had<00:05:03.449> perhaps<00:05:04.020> that<00:05:04.199> could<00:05:04.289> work<00:05:04.470> in

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
Liverpool had perhaps that could work in

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:05.120 
Liverpool had perhaps that could work in
his<00:05:04.650> favor

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
his favor

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.409 
his favor
and<00:05:05.280> who<00:05:05.460> does<00:05:05.610> well<00:05:05.820> he<00:05:06.000> could<00:05:06.090> have<00:05:06.120> a<00:05:06.240> long

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
and who does well he could have a long

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.390 
and who does well he could have a long
career<00:05:06.600> there's<00:05:06.990> only<00:05:07.080> 39<00:05:07.710> years<00:05:08.039> old

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
career there's only 39 years old

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.500 
career there's only 39 years old
I<00:05:08.490> think<00:05:08.760> Liverpool<00:05:09.090> need<00:05:09.210> to<00:05:09.270> give<00:05:09.389> him<00:05:09.479> a

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
I think Liverpool need to give him a

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.510 
I think Liverpool need to give him a
little<00:05:09.660> bit<00:05:09.870> of<00:05:09.960> time<00:05:10.139> to<00:05:10.710> get<00:05:10.889> used<00:05:11.070> to<00:05:11.220> it<00:05:11.340> to

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
little bit of time to get used to it to

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.890 
little bit of time to get used to it to
get<00:05:11.669> used<00:05:11.820> to<00:05:11.910> being<00:05:12.060> a<00:05:12.180> bigger<00:05:12.389> club<00:05:12.690> and

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
get used to being a bigger club and

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.350 
get used to being a bigger club and
hopefully<00:05:13.590> he<00:05:13.949> can<00:05:14.099> do<00:05:14.250> well<00:05:14.460> that's<00:05:14.940> it<00:05:15.180> for

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
hopefully he can do well that's it for

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.939 
hopefully he can do well that's it for
now<00:05:15.479> let<00:05:15.930> me<00:05:16.050> know<00:05:16.169> what<00:05:16.289> you<00:05:16.380> think<00:05:16.590> about<00:05:16.680> the
