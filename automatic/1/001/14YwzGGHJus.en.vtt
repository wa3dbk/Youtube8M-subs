00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.729
 the karlsruher sc are 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.729
 powered by bathing tv 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.099
 a very offensive offensive 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.689
 Aligned with one with one 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:19.830
 diamond set with seven people 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:21.330
 we saw that it was 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.800
 inevitably means then also one 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.140
 opponent to the wall plays that one had 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.220
 to be out there 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.660
 we still tried the ball up 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.490
 maybe also offensive 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.669
 to have orientation on perhaps 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.500
 to get the punch exchange 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:37.140
 but still very defensive we played 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.400
 have from these possibilities always only 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.360
 phased made what it is 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.489
 of course, a point where we 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.010
 want to work the constancy and there 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.690
 Just to find the people 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.920
 a mix between artists and 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.390
 maybe just the footballers 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.180
 they just win and fight 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.830
 to play next yes that you can not 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.479
 but that one dies in beauty 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.220
 also knows when to be functional 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:59.489
 plays and you just too fast 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.110
 we are doing the training forwards 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.500
 but it must also be the right place 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.610
 his 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.030
 you can not mix yet 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:09.200
 fully found, while the next 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.200
 start on wednesday 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.370
 no of the 3 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.100
 that the word khalifa is true and that 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:24.479
 pressure is from day one here that 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:30.210
 that we knew the previous one on the 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:33.780
 question comes because of me or we 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:37.440
 from our side say that the markus 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.390
 to take that literally a lot 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.390
 long can happen on the spot 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.759
 with his trainers team we have the 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:49.200
 markus not with a two-year contract 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:54.090
 equipped to play now after 13 days 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.550
 because of any discussions 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:01.820
 I wondered that tomorrow too 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:05.880
 you let go of such a sentence in the newspaper 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:09.259
 yes, that was and still is the goal 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.090
 resurgence still 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:15.780
 economically we would have to 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.700
 ascend if we do not 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.329
 even then we get the next one 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.799
 Third season we voted 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:24.799
 Develop something together here 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.600
 we have a young viable one 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:33.630
 Team we know that in this 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:38.730
 Not everything was over for us 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:41.269
 it would also have been luckier with something 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.790
 a little more determination 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.980
 single-mindedly we could today 678 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.090
 have more points 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.090
 but what matters is that we are here 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.340
 want to develop something 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:58.880
