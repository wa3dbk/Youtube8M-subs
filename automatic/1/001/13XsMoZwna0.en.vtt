00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
inside I have some white paper I think I

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.740 
inside I have some white paper I think I
use<00:01:03.070> freezer<00:01:03.430> paper<00:01:03.699> and<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:07.299> will<00:01:07.509> help<00:01:07.630> to

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
use freezer paper and that will help to

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.990 
use freezer paper and that will help to
diffuse<00:01:08.680> the<00:01:08.950> light<00:01:09.130> that's<00:01:09.340> coming<00:01:09.670> in<00:01:09.790> so

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
diffuse the light that's coming in so

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.499 
diffuse the light that's coming in so
that<00:01:10.119> you<00:01:10.240> don't<00:01:10.420> have<00:01:10.540> hard<00:01:10.869> shadows<00:01:11.320> and

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
that you don't have hard shadows and

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:15.060 
that you don't have hard shadows and
down<00:01:13.509> the<00:01:13.689> middle<00:01:13.840> I<00:01:14.140> just<00:01:14.409> have<00:01:14.590> some<00:01:14.950> more

is<00:02:15.069> just<00:02:15.370> starting<00:02:15.670> to<00:02:15.730> get<00:02:16.060> a<00:02:16.120> little<00:02:16.299> a<00:02:16.799> lot

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
is just starting to get a little a lot

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.759 
is just starting to get a little a lot
whiter<00:02:18.099> and<00:02:18.900> you<00:02:19.900> want<00:02:20.080> to<00:02:20.170> kind<00:02:20.439> of<00:02:20.530> push<00:02:20.739> it

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
whiter and you want to kind of push it

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.080 
whiter and you want to kind of push it
to<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.040> edge<00:02:21.280> there<00:02:21.580> you<00:02:21.700> don't<00:02:21.849> want<00:02:21.970> it<00:02:22.030> to

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
to the edge there you don't want it to

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.720 
to the edge there you don't want it to
be<00:02:22.209> too<00:02:22.360> much<00:02:22.569> like<00:02:22.900> this<00:02:23.110> but<00:02:23.530> you<00:02:24.010> know<00:02:24.069> just

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
be too much like this but you know just

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.679 
be too much like this but you know just
enough<00:02:25.000> to<00:02:26.730> where<00:02:27.730> it's<00:02:27.909> just<00:02:28.060> a<00:02:28.269> little<00:02:28.299> too

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:28.689 
enough to where it's just a little too

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:30.570 
enough to where it's just a little too
much<00:02:28.930> and<00:02:29.170> that's<00:02:29.380> perfect<00:02:29.860> because<00:02:30.280> you<00:02:30.490> need

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
much and that's perfect because you need

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.420 
much and that's perfect because you need
to<00:02:30.670> come<00:02:30.790> in<00:02:30.910> with<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.120> contrast<00:02:31.660> here<00:02:31.990> and

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
to come in with the contrast here and

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.620 
to come in with the contrast here and
take<00:02:33.430> that<00:02:33.459> away<00:02:33.910> so

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
take that away so

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:35.850 
take that away so
this<00:02:34.750> is<00:02:34.900> essentially<00:02:35.500> making<00:02:35.710> the

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
this is essentially making the

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.840 
this is essentially making the
background<00:02:36.160> white<00:02:36.790> and<00:02:38.430> taking<00:02:39.430> away<00:02:39.610> some

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
background white and taking away some

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.340 
background white and taking away some
shadow<00:02:40.120> as<00:02:40.390> well<00:02:40.420> so<00:02:40.930> we'll<00:02:41.050> go<00:02:41.110> ahead<00:02:41.140> and

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
shadow as well so we'll go ahead and

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.070 
shadow as well so we'll go ahead and
apply<00:02:41.530> that<00:02:41.620> and<00:02:42.430> you<00:02:42.550> can<00:02:42.730> see<00:02:43.000> there's<00:02:43.930> just

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
apply that and you can see there's just

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.990 
apply that and you can see there's just
there's<00:02:44.560> no<00:02:44.620> other<00:02:44.800> distractions<00:02:45.520> going<00:02:45.760> on

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
there's no other distractions going on

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.380 
there's no other distractions going on
it's<00:02:46.600> just<00:02:46.960> the<00:02:47.080> shoe<00:02:47.550> they<00:02:48.550> can<00:02:48.730> focus<00:02:48.970> on<00:02:49.270> the

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
it's just the shoe they can focus on the

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.310 
it's just the shoe they can focus on the
shoe<00:02:49.630> and<00:02:51.450> you<00:02:52.450> know<00:02:52.570> that's<00:02:52.750> it<00:02:52.990> there's

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
shoe and you know that's it there's

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.940 
shoe and you know that's it there's
nothing<00:02:53.590> else<00:02:53.710> going<00:02:54.040> on<00:02:54.760> there<00:02:55.650> so<00:02:56.650> we'll<00:02:56.770> do

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
nothing else going on there so we'll do

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.160 
nothing else going on there so we'll do
this<00:02:57.130> I<00:02:57.400> do<00:02:57.910> this<00:02:58.030> like<00:02:58.510> I<00:02:58.600> said<00:02:58.780> I<00:02:58.810> do<00:02:58.930> this<00:02:59.050> to

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
this I do this like I said I do this to

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.100 
this I do this like I said I do this to
all<00:02:59.320> all<00:02:59.800> the<00:03:00.130> images<00:03:00.550> so<00:03:01.480> if<00:03:01.570> they<00:03:01.690> can<00:03:01.870> see

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
all all the images so if they can see

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.620 
all all the images so if they can see
every<00:03:03.100> angle<00:03:04.060> of<00:03:04.330> the<00:03:04.480> shoe<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:06.940> this<00:03:07.480> is

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
every angle of the shoe and this is

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.620 
every angle of the shoe and this is
pretty<00:03:08.020> much<00:03:08.140> what<00:03:08.560> all<00:03:08.890> all<00:03:09.340> of<00:03:09.880> my<00:03:10.120> listings

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
pretty much what all all of my listings

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.650 
pretty much what all all of my listings
look<00:03:10.900> like<00:03:11.170> with<00:03:11.830> the<00:03:12.070> angles<00:03:12.490> I'll<00:03:13.060> start

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
look like with the angles I'll start

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.240 
look like with the angles I'll start
with<00:03:13.810> one<00:03:14.110> shoe<00:03:14.380> either<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.830> right<00:03:14.950> shore<00:03:15.130> the

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
with one shoe either the right shore the

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.900 
with one shoe either the right shore the
left<00:03:15.460> shoe<00:03:15.670> and<00:03:16.120> I<00:03:17.050> kind<00:03:17.350> of<00:03:17.380> angle<00:03:17.710> it<00:03:17.910> like

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
left shoe and I kind of angle it like

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.820 
left shoe and I kind of angle it like
this<00:03:19.180> and<00:03:19.480> then<00:03:19.960> like<00:03:20.110> this<00:03:20.320> on<00:03:20.650> the<00:03:20.800> other

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
this and then like this on the other

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.220 
this and then like this on the other
side<00:03:21.010> of<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.400> shoe<00:03:21.610> and<00:03:21.820> then<00:03:22.570> I<00:03:22.870> get<00:03:23.110> the

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
side of the shoe and then I get the

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.040 
side of the shoe and then I get the
other<00:03:23.260> shoe<00:03:23.500> and<00:03:23.890> I<00:03:23.980> do<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.370> exact<00:03:24.730> same<00:03:24.940> thing

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.900 

it's<00:03:29.050> kind<00:03:29.230> of<00:03:29.290> time-consuming<00:03:29.920> I<00:03:30.130> know<00:03:30.220> but<00:03:30.640> I

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
it's kind of time-consuming I know but I

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.590 
it's kind of time-consuming I know but I
feel<00:03:31.510> that<00:03:32.520> having<00:03:33.520> better<00:03:33.880> photos<00:03:34.360> in<00:03:34.570> my

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
feel that having better photos in my

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:46.449 
feel that having better photos in my

really good for for pre-owned shoes so I

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.240 
really good for for pre-owned shoes so I
know<00:04:44.870> this<00:04:44.990> is<00:04:45.050> kind<00:04:45.169> of<00:04:45.229> time-consuming<00:04:45.470> and

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
know this is kind of time-consuming and

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.800 
know this is kind of time-consuming and
some<00:04:46.460> people<00:04:46.699> probably<00:04:46.940> wouldn't<00:04:47.360> do<00:04:47.599> this

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
some people probably wouldn't do this

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:57.209 
some people probably wouldn't do this

and that's how you do it you got a nice
white<00:05:17.530> background<00:05:17.800> I<00:05:18.250> mean<00:05:18.370> you<00:05:18.460> can't<00:05:18.640> even

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
white background I mean you can't even

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.790

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
white screen ends I mean it looks really

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.950 
white screen ends I mean it looks really
good<00:05:23.530> the<00:05:23.920> shadow<00:05:24.220> has<00:05:24.760> gone<00:05:25.000> down<00:05:25.300> because<00:05:25.570> it

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
good the shadow has gone down because it

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.100 
good the shadow has gone down because it
was<00:05:26.110> a<00:05:26.140> little<00:05:26.470> bit<00:05:26.590> of<00:05:26.800> a<00:05:26.920> heavier<00:05:27.220> shadow<00:05:28.110> but

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
was a little bit of a heavier shadow but

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.160 
was a little bit of a heavier shadow but
it<00:05:29.170> helps<00:05:29.410> to<00:05:29.560> control<00:05:29.920> that<00:05:30.220> and<00:05:31.210> you<00:05:31.690> can<00:05:31.870> you
