00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.410
 Hello everyone, Julia is with you today. 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.460
 I will tell you all the secrets of this strange 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.460
 little Ferbie 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:22.750
 Ferbie is shown on the side and it is shown that he 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.610
 may laugh that it can be pulled for 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.710
 tail and he reacts to it that he 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.290
 reacts to music and starts dancing 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.330
 and sing well and of course can talk to you 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.530
 some phrases and even in Russian they are on 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.730
 in our tongue behind, we again see a ferb and 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.500
 different variations of his character he 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.010
 maybe evil he can be somehow 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.870
 cheerful cute strange and in general more 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.910
 he has a lot of different characters 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.559
 if you start playing with it then you will get 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.870
 a lot of fun firstly because 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.850
 he is wildly soft he is nice his is nice 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.100
 scratch to touch with something else more 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.610
 cool is that it reacts to your 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.650
 carding tickling touch if 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.989
 long his hours then he will rejoice 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.620
 there purr depending what he has 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.869
 character 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.800
 still reacting to tickling here you can 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.170
 tickle 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.640
 all arbi you can put your finger in your mouth and 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:14.140
 let's check what will happen 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:17.110
 o begin to eat it and in my opinion it 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.729
 like this way you can and 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.429
 feed he will be glad and happy 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.979
 damage I thought plastic ears 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:28.710
 in fact, it turned out that they are soft 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.710
 it seems like rubber they bury you 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:36.000
 a light sensor is located on the forehead of a ferb 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.940
 and on the Internet write that it is necessary for 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.910
 to sleep at night together 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.240
 with you and woke up in the morning as well as 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.340
 you 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.190
 I didnâ€™t bother you at night and slept too 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.200
 the eyes in ferby are electronic and in them 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.410
 absolutely all emotions are displayed 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.180
 which he feels and eyes 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.220
 periodically you can understand much more 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.080
 rather than by his behavior or phrase 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.450
 his eyes depict what he does not 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.270
 I like what he feels there 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.020
 there are hearts of lightning hurls and in general 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.520
 all sorts of special effects still ferby 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.920
 plastic beak that moves 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.709
 who can draw a finger like we already 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.050
 have seen and when the ferb speaks he 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.570
 of course he is moved by yorg has paws 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.780
 cute soft feet with something soft 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.790
 poured behind the ferb tail and 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.440
 you can even braid his pigtails 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.570
 because the furry tail and he 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.290
 reacts if you pull his tail 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.830
 and we don't really like the tuffy arch 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.870
 react to a change of position if its 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.510
 flip and throw 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.280
 sometimes he doesn't like it and it all 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.380
 spills over into some bad 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.880
 if the character is not itching for a long time 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.160
 study and just leave it somewhere 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.170
 alone tone of certainly misses 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.840
 by trying to get your attention but 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.120
 if he doesn't get it, then it's time to decide 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.340
 sleep says she want to sleep and due to 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.200
 and as you can hear about the firm says 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.150
 in some strange and incomprehensible language 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.850
 they called it ferber 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.070
 but sometimes you can hear him by the way. 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.470
 speaks Russian periodically he 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.690
 says either one word or 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.489
 any phrase creepy focus on 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:15.870
 very cool for example he said 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:18.739
 good or i like my favorite 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:22.320
 phrase as it turned out to eat and 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:24.330
 Delicious as I said, you can already Ferbie 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.400
 change character and everything 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.320
 depends on what you do with it when 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.760
 this frby can be pretty 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.500
 kindly keep saying something 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.840
 nice to all be happy 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.150
 and sing some joyful songs yet he 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.100
 may be a boor to publish a variety 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.470
 indecent sounds for example he can 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.960
 fart and burp still he can be very 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.400
 constantly angry all the unhappy and all 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.960
 it depends on what you do 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.209
 for example if you feed him a lot and 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.760
 tickling then he will be a boor 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:54.390
 just the same fart burp and everything from there 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.610
 resulting if the farm is long ironed and 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.709
 scratch it will become melenky and 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.350
 some on the internet called him a ferb 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:04.200
 nyashka evil ferby can become if his 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.600
 flip and bash 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.730
 general variations a lot of experimenting 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:12.620
 it can be a long time 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.620
 I, too, will feed some 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:41.390
 he ran the character hell we changed 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:44.700
 character and now he is an evil ham who 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.800
 farts burp does not generally issue the most 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.460
 scary sounds and as you can see in the eyes 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.460
 he is completely different
