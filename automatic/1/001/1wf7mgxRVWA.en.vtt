well<00:01:28.829> on<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.250> tablet<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:29.850> really<00:01:30.360> enjoyed<00:01:30.600> using

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.140 
well on a tablet I really enjoyed using
it<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.170> also<00:01:31.470> like<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.770> URL<00:01:32.430> sharing<00:01:32.909> feature

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
it I also like the URL sharing feature

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.539 
it I also like the URL sharing feature
so<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.689> can<00:01:33.840> send<00:01:34.110> URLs<00:01:34.770> from<00:01:35.009> one<00:01:35.220> device<00:01:35.400> to

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
so you can send URLs from one device to

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.789 
so you can send URLs from one device to
another<00:01:35.820> now<00:01:36.570> sharing<00:01:36.930> web<00:01:37.110> pages<00:01:37.500> might<00:01:37.619> not

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
another now sharing web pages might not

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.190 
another now sharing web pages might not
sound<00:01:38.009> brilliant<00:01:38.490> but<00:01:39.270> if<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.720> think<00:01:40.020> that

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
sound brilliant but if you think that

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.719
