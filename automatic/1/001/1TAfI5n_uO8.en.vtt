amp that had switchable distortion in it
now<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.899> reason<00:00:49.260> why<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.379> don't<00:00:49.680> know<00:00:49.800> that

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
now the reason why you don't know that

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.470 
now the reason why you don't know that
is<00:00:50.129> because<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.579> distortion<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.180> was<00:00:51.329> in

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
is because the distortion that was in

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.200 
is because the distortion that was in
there<00:00:51.690> was<00:00:51.840> horrible<00:00:52.820> though<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.879> worst

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
there was horrible though the worst

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.660 
there was horrible though the worst
distortion<00:00:54.930> on<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.050> planet<00:00:55.649> okay<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.430> turn

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
distortion on the planet okay you turn

Taurus circuit kind of built-in right it
was<00:01:47.100> exhausting<00:01:47.700> this<00:01:47.880> this<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.720> c1

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
was exhausting this this is the c1

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.749 
was exhausting this this is the c1
circuit<00:01:49.560> or<00:01:49.650> something<00:01:49.920> very<00:01:50.100> similar<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.549> it

circuit or something very similar to it

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.870 
circuit or something very similar to it
this<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.509> recreation<00:01:52.170> obviously<00:01:52.950> as<00:01:53.520> times

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
this is a recreation obviously as times

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.310 
this is a recreation obviously as times
have<00:01:53.970> changed<00:01:54.330> you<00:01:54.420> can't<00:01:54.630> get<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.840> same<00:01:55.049> part

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
have changed you can't get the same part

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.050 
have changed you can't get the same part
so<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.799> course<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.310> know<00:01:56.460> trying<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.880> find

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
so of course you know trying to find

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.130 
so of course you know trying to find
those<00:01:57.240> original<00:01:57.600> components<00:01:58.049> that's

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
those original components that's

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.899 
those original components that's
impossible<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:58.890> we<00:01:59.009> get<00:01:59.189> we<00:01:59.340> got<00:01:59.460> as<00:01:59.580> close<00:01:59.610> as

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
impossible so we get we got as close as

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.969 
impossible so we get we got as close as
we<00:02:00.030> possibly<00:02:00.420> could<00:02:00.570> with<00:02:00.780> current<00:02:01.110> parts<00:02:01.530> the

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
we possibly could with current parts the

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:20.259 
we possibly could with current parts the
sound<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.490> there<00:02:02.759> though<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.270> 100%<00:02:03.810> that

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:25.280 

sounds<00:02:22.760> actually<00:02:23.760> how<00:02:24.239> is<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.600> distortion<00:02:25.019> on

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
sounds actually how is the distortion on

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
sounds actually how is the distortion on
this<00:02:25.440> thing<00:02:27.170> do<00:02:28.170> you<00:02:28.260> guys<00:02:28.410> know<00:02:28.650> anything

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
you know wasn't in there before some

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:42.839 
you know wasn't in there before some

well<00:03:43.030> and<00:03:43.510> one<00:03:44.200> of<00:03:44.260> the<00:03:44.319> cool<00:03:44.500> things<00:03:44.709> when<00:03:44.859> we

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
well and one of the cool things when we

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.220 
well and one of the cool things when we
discontinued<00:03:45.549> the<00:03:45.669> rv3<00:03:45.970> the<00:03:46.689> original<00:03:47.109> one

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
discontinued the rv3 the original one

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.839 
discontinued the rv3 the original one
had<00:03:47.379> had<00:03:47.560> delay<00:03:47.889> and<00:03:48.129> reverb<00:03:48.280> at<00:03:48.579> the<00:03:48.669> same

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
had had delay and reverb at the same

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:51.750 
had had delay and reverb at the same
time<00:03:49.120> we<00:03:50.049> caught<00:03:50.230> a<00:03:50.260> lot<00:03:50.470> of<00:03:50.500> heat<00:03:50.709> for<00:03:50.859> that<00:03:50.919> we

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
time we caught a lot of heat for that we

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.580 
time we caught a lot of heat for that we
brought<00:03:51.970> it<00:03:52.090> back<00:03:52.120> so<00:03:52.540> now<00:03:52.689> in<00:03:52.810> the<00:03:52.900> our<00:03:53.019> v6<00:03:53.200> you

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
brought it back so now in the our v6 you

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.800 
brought it back so now in the our v6 you
have<00:03:53.769> delay<00:03:54.220> and<00:03:54.519> reverb<00:03:54.939> at<00:03:55.269> the<00:03:55.359> same<00:03:55.569> time

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
have delay and reverb at the same time

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.469 
have delay and reverb at the same time
in<00:03:56.019> the<00:03:56.079> pedal<00:03:56.349> zone<00:03:56.590> there's<00:03:57.489> a<00:03:57.609> the<00:03:58.299> new

00:03:58.469 --> 00:03:58.479 
in the pedal zone there's a the new

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:00.719 
in the pedal zone there's a the new
algorithms<00:03:59.019> were<00:03:59.169> actually<00:03:59.530> designed<00:03:59.919> by<00:04:00.669> the

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:00.729 
algorithms were actually designed by the

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:03.839 
algorithms were actually designed by the
engineer<00:04:01.299> who<00:04:01.840> did<00:04:02.049> the<00:04:02.199> SRV<00:04:03.010> series<00:04:03.459> reverbs

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
engineer who did the SRV series reverbs

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:06.059 
engineer who did the SRV series reverbs
back<00:04:04.150> in<00:04:04.329> the<00:04:04.419> day<00:04:05.229> back<00:04:05.409> in<00:04:05.470> the<00:04:05.590> 80s<00:04:05.949> when<00:04:06.040> we

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
back in the day back in the 80s when we

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:07.199 
back in the day back in the 80s when we
had<00:04:06.129> the<00:04:06.280> rackmount<00:04:06.609> reverb<00:04:06.970> that<00:04:07.150> were

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
had the rackmount reverb that were

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.869 
had the rackmount reverb that were
competing<00:04:07.510> with<00:04:07.690> other<00:04:08.560> companies<00:04:09.040> that<00:04:09.400> were

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:09.879 
competing with other companies that were

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:11.699 
competing with other companies that were
you<00:04:10.239> know<00:04:10.269> very<00:04:10.569> studio<00:04:10.930> friendly<00:04:11.349> and<00:04:11.500> a<00:04:11.530> lot

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
you know very studio friendly and a lot

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:12.930 
you know very studio friendly and a lot
of<00:04:11.739> guys<00:04:11.919> still<00:04:12.250> have<00:04:12.400> them<00:04:12.579> because<00:04:12.819> they

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
of guys still have them because they

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.309 
of guys still have them because they
have<00:04:13.030> those<00:04:13.209> reverb<00:04:13.540> algorithms<00:04:14.019> were<00:04:14.139> so

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
have those reverb algorithms were so

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.319 
have those reverb algorithms were so
good<00:04:14.530> so<00:04:15.129> he<00:04:15.310> oversaw<00:04:15.639> the<00:04:15.699> development<00:04:15.909> of

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329
