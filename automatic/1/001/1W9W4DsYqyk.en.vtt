 3 given the loads a blog and a 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:19.150
 little advertising what makes us a 

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:21.460
 very impressive collector he is 

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:24.849
 excellent to irritate now we can 

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:27.130
 we can understand the price a little bit 

00:07:24.849 --> 00:07:30.099
 excessive on its release from a first 

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:31.750
 remember were 150 euros after for 60 

00:07:30.099 --> 00:07:33.370

 euros by beating

 but still it's like a super 

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:44.260
 collector I thought he's better 

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:46.810
 that the collector maastricht generation 

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:48.760

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:51.030
 is a little bit smaller but I 

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:55.270
 find much more content 

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:56.800
