00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.820 

there's<00:00:05.970> only<00:00:06.149> four<00:00:06.600> cuts<00:00:06.930> in<00:00:07.109> the<00:00:07.200> world<00:00:07.379> and

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
there's only four cuts in the world and

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.220 
there's only four cuts in the world and
we<00:00:08.730> break<00:00:08.940> them<00:00:09.059> down<00:00:09.090> into<00:00:09.510> these<00:00:09.600> four<00:00:09.660> cuts

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
we break them down into these four cuts

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.970 
we break them down into these four cuts
and<00:00:10.500> I'm<00:00:11.010> going<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.280> describe<00:00:11.849> these<00:00:12.000> cuts<00:00:12.360> a

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:12.980 
and I'm going to describe these cuts a

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.200 
and I'm going to describe these cuts a
little<00:00:13.980> differently<00:00:14.719> it's<00:00:16.610> not<00:00:17.610> what's

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
little differently it's not what's

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.359 
little differently it's not what's
happening<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.960> wood<00:00:19.140> you<00:00:19.349> hear<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.770> lot<00:00:19.950> of

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.720 

terminology<00:00:23.369> like<00:00:25.220> roughing<00:00:26.220> out<00:00:26.369> cut

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
terminology like roughing out cut

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.249 
terminology like roughing out cut
shearing<00:00:27.329> cuts<00:00:29.300> slicing<00:00:30.300> cuts<00:00:30.599> different

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:31.259 
shearing cuts slicing cuts different

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:33.110 
shearing cuts slicing cuts different
things<00:00:31.529> that<00:00:31.739> people<00:00:31.800> use<00:00:32.340> in<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.640> so<00:00:32.790> it's

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
things that people use in it so it's

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.389 
things that people use in it so it's
pretty<00:00:33.239> confusing<00:00:33.980> what<00:00:34.980> I'm<00:00:35.100> going<00:00:35.340> to

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
pretty confusing what I'm going to

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.730 
pretty confusing what I'm going to
describe<00:00:35.820> or<00:00:36.390> my<00:00:36.540> definitions<00:00:37.170> are<00:00:37.350> going<00:00:37.620> to

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:37.740 
describe or my definitions are going to

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.300 
describe or my definitions are going to
be<00:00:38.270> what<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.420> cutting<00:00:39.720> edge<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.170> doing<00:00:40.560> okay

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.310 
be what the cutting edge is doing okay

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.819 
be what the cutting edge is doing okay
and<00:00:41.520> so<00:00:42.300> we're<00:00:42.810> going<00:00:42.990> to<00:00:43.140> have<00:00:43.260> only<00:00:43.500> four

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
and so we're going to have only four

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.660 
and so we're going to have only four
cuts<00:00:44.100> we've<00:00:44.340> got<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:49.070> I'm<00:00:50.070> gonna<00:00:50.220> leave<00:00:50.460> these

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
cuts we've got a I'm gonna leave these

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.400 
cuts we've got a I'm gonna leave these
on<00:00:50.880> here<00:00:51.090> for<00:00:51.300> quite<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.540> while<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:51.810> hope<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.350> don't

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
on here for quite a while I hope I don't

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.569 
on here for quite a while I hope I don't
have<00:00:52.650> to<00:00:52.770> destroy<00:00:52.950> them<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:53.430> we're<00:00:53.520> gonna

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
have to destroy them so we're gonna

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:02.110 
have to destroy them so we're gonna
leave<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.820> push<00:00:54.120> cut<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.630> pull<00:00:55.620> cut<00:00:57.230> scrape<00:01:00.950> and

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
leave a push cut a pull cut scrape and

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:10.879 
leave a push cut a pull cut scrape and
they're<00:01:03.120> straight<00:01:08.659> okay<00:01:09.689> now<00:01:10.439> let's<00:01:10.649> draw<00:01:10.799> a

00:01:10.879 --> 00:01:10.889 
they're straight okay now let's draw a

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:13.279 
they're straight okay now let's draw a
line<00:01:11.159> straight<00:01:11.340> across<00:01:11.700> here<00:01:11.819> and<00:01:12.359> separate

00:01:13.279 --> 00:01:13.289 
line straight across here and separate

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:16.099 
line straight across here and separate
these<00:01:13.469> into<00:01:13.530> two<00:01:14.069> categories<00:01:14.630> the<00:01:15.630> push<00:01:15.869> cut

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:16.109 
these into two categories the push cut

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:18.950 
these into two categories the push cut
in<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.259> pull<00:01:16.469> cut<00:01:16.710> have<00:01:17.219> bevel<00:01:17.819> support<00:01:18.210> the

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
in the pull cut have bevel support the

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.660 
in the pull cut have bevel support the
scrape<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.530> shear<00:01:19.740> scrape<00:01:19.979> do<00:01:20.340> not<00:01:20.490> have

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
scrape and the shear scrape do not have

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.510 
scrape and the shear scrape do not have
bevel<00:01:20.969> support<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:21.840> let's<00:01:22.020> put<00:01:22.170> over<00:01:22.380> here

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.550 

okay<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:27.409> the<00:01:29.479> easiest<00:01:30.479> way<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.810> get<00:01:31.200> wood<00:01:31.439> away

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
okay so the easiest way to get wood away

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.510 
okay so the easiest way to get wood away
the<00:01:32.490> fastest<00:01:33.060> easiest<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.749> the<00:01:34.619> push<00:01:34.799> cut<00:01:35.039> and

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
the fastest easiest is the push cut and

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.889 
the fastest easiest is the push cut and
we're<00:01:35.639> going<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.819> use<00:01:35.969> the<00:01:36.149> push<00:01:36.329> cut<00:01:36.600> probably

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
we're going to use the push cut probably

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.019 
we're going to use the push cut probably
I<00:01:37.499> don't<00:01:38.279> know<00:01:38.340> what<00:01:38.520> percentage

00:01:39.019 --> 00:01:39.029 
I don't know what percentage

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:40.699 
I don't know what percentage
three-quarters<00:01:39.959> of<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.170> time<00:01:40.380> something

00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:40.709 
three-quarters of the time something

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:43.669 
three-quarters of the time something
like<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.509> the<00:01:42.509> pull<00:01:42.689> cut<00:01:42.929> is<00:01:43.079> just<00:01:43.350> going<00:01:43.560> to

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:43.679 
like that the pull cut is just going to

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:45.319 
like that the pull cut is just going to
use<00:01:43.859> in<00:01:44.069> a<00:01:44.159> place<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.399> we<00:01:44.700> can't<00:01:44.909> reach<00:01:45.119> with

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
use in a place that we can't reach with

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.149 
use in a place that we can't reach with
the<00:01:45.450> push<00:01:45.600> cut<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.409> scrape<00:01:46.709> and<00:01:46.859> the<00:01:46.950> shear

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
the push cut the scrape and the shear

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.429 
the push cut the scrape and the shear
straight<00:01:47.429> bar<00:01:47.670> or<00:01:47.939> shaping<00:01:48.599> and<00:01:49.020> finishing

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
straight bar or shaping and finishing

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.589 
straight bar or shaping and finishing
cuts<00:01:49.649> so<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.729> push<00:01:50.909> cuts<00:01:51.149> what<00:01:51.329> we're<00:01:51.479> going

00:01:51.589 --> 00:01:51.599 
cuts so the push cuts what we're going

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:54.169 
cuts so the push cuts what we're going
to<00:01:51.659> going<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.259> use<00:01:52.469> most<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.009> time<00:01:53.099> in<00:01:54.029> the

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
to going to use most of the time in the

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.059 
to going to use most of the time in the
pushing<00:01:54.539> cut<00:01:54.749> there's<00:01:55.529> a<00:01:55.590> number<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.889> things

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:56.069 
pushing cut there's a number of things

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:58.730 
pushing cut there's a number of things
that<00:01:56.459> that<00:01:56.700> will<00:01:56.999> get<00:01:57.179> us<00:01:57.329> close<00:01:57.749> to<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.349> sweet

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
that that will get us close to a sweet

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.050 
that that will get us close to a sweet
spot<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.159> that's<00:01:59.490> what<00:01:59.639> we're<00:01:59.759> looking<00:02:00.029> for

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
spot and that's what we're looking for

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.519 
spot and that's what we're looking for
we're<00:02:00.329> looking<00:02:00.359> for<00:02:00.569> a<00:02:00.719> sweet<00:02:00.990> spot<00:02:01.229> here

00:02:01.519 --> 00:02:01.529 
we're looking for a sweet spot here

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:04.039 
we're looking for a sweet spot here
that's<00:02:01.919> working<00:02:02.310> just<00:02:02.490> effortlessly<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.419> so

that's working just effortlessly and so
flute<00:02:04.679> is<00:02:04.859> going<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.429> be<00:02:05.520> pointing<00:02:05.909> in<00:02:05.969> the

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
flute is going to be pointing in the

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.789 
flute is going to be pointing in the
direction<00:02:06.119> I'm<00:02:06.569> going<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.749> travel<00:02:07.109> so<00:02:07.709> I'm

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
direction I'm going to travel so I'm

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.910 
direction I'm going to travel so I'm
going<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:07.979> go<00:02:08.160> from<00:02:09.000> my<00:02:09.209> right<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.720> left<00:02:09.959> across

going to go from my right to left across

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.880 
going to go from my right to left across
the<00:02:11.610> tool<00:02:11.790> rest<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.330> so<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.409> flutes<00:02:13.650> going<00:02:13.829> to

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
the tool rest and so the flutes going to

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.890 
the tool rest and so the flutes going to
point<00:02:14.010> in<00:02:14.099> that<00:02:14.159> direction<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:15.209> twist<00:02:15.599> of<00:02:15.810> the

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
point in that direction the twist of the

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.470 
point in that direction the twist of the
flute<00:02:16.170> is<00:02:17.099> going<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.459> be<00:02:17.549> about<00:02:17.790> on<00:02:17.939> a<00:02:17.970> 45

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
flute is going to be about on a 45

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.570 
flute is going to be about on a 45
degree<00:02:18.810> angle<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:19.650> if<00:02:19.739> I<00:02:19.860> lay<00:02:20.099> a<00:02:20.129> straightedge

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
degree angle so if I lay a straightedge

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.240 
degree angle so if I lay a straightedge
on<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.180> top<00:02:21.390> of<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:21.629> flute<00:02:21.900> it's<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.860> angle

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
on the top of the flute it's the angle

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.449 
on the top of the flute it's the angle
is<00:02:23.459> about<00:02:24.060> 45<00:02:24.629> degrees<00:02:24.799> it's<00:02:25.799> not<00:02:25.920> straight<00:02:26.430> up

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
is about 45 degrees it's not straight up

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.089 
is about 45 degrees it's not straight up
and<00:02:26.879> it's<00:02:27.510> not<00:02:27.690> straight<00:02:28.110> over<00:02:28.470> towards<00:02:28.920> the

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
and it's not straight over towards the

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.960 
and it's not straight over towards the
wood<00:02:29.280> it's<00:02:29.909> twisted<00:02:30.840> on<00:02:30.959> a<00:02:30.989> 45<00:02:31.470> degree<00:02:31.680> angle

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
wood it's twisted on a 45 degree angle

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.720 
wood it's twisted on a 45 degree angle
okay<00:02:32.970> and<00:02:33.180> now<00:02:34.140> one<00:02:35.010> of<00:02:35.069> the<00:02:35.160> most<00:02:35.310> important

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
okay and now one of the most important

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:36.949 
okay and now one of the most important
things<00:02:35.940> that<00:02:36.030> we<00:02:36.180> need<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.450> start<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:36.930> think

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
things that we need to start to think

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.309 
things that we need to start to think
about<00:02:37.200> is<00:02:37.620> where<00:02:38.400> that<00:02:38.610> bevel<00:02:39.030> is<00:02:39.209> the<00:02:39.930> bevel

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
about is where that bevel is the bevel

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.289 
about is where that bevel is the bevel
everybody<00:02:41.010> talks<00:02:41.250> about<00:02:41.519> the<00:02:41.640> bevel<00:02:41.940> what<00:02:42.150> is

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
everybody talks about the bevel what is

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:43.759 
everybody talks about the bevel what is
the<00:02:42.420> bevel<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.840> bevel<00:02:43.140> is<00:02:43.200> that<00:02:43.379> little<00:02:43.620> real

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
the bevel the bevel is that little real

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.559 
the bevel the bevel is that little real
estate<00:02:43.799> where<00:02:44.280> that<00:02:44.430> black<00:02:44.670> line<00:02:44.940> is<00:02:45.180> on<00:02:45.420> my

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
estate where that black line is on my

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.149 
estate where that black line is on my
wooden<00:02:46.280> mock-up<00:02:47.280> here<00:02:47.790> is<00:02:48.110> from<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.230> heel<00:02:49.530> to

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
wooden mock-up here is from the heel to

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:52.369 
wooden mock-up here is from the heel to
the<00:02:50.250> sharp<00:02:50.519> edge<00:02:50.849> there's<00:02:51.629> a<00:02:51.720> straight<00:02:52.079> line

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
the sharp edge there's a straight line

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.589 
the sharp edge there's a straight line
and<00:02:53.129> it<00:02:53.579> can<00:02:53.790> be<00:02:53.910> a<00:02:53.940> little<00:02:54.180> hollow<00:02:54.329> ground

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
and it can be a little hollow ground

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.069 
and it can be a little hollow ground
with<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.079> the<00:02:55.730> grinder<00:02:56.730> but<00:02:57.390> there's<00:02:57.780> a<00:02:57.840> line

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
with the the grinder but there's a line

00:02:58.079 --> 00:02:59.990 
with the the grinder but there's a line
between<00:02:58.109> the<00:02:58.590> heel<00:02:58.769> and<00:02:58.799> the<00:02:59.040> toe<00:02:59.069> that<00:02:59.700> gives

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
between the heel and the toe that gives

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.360 
between the heel and the toe that gives
us<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.359> direction<00:03:00.540> that<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.590> tool<00:03:01.829> wants<00:03:02.250> to

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
us the direction that the tool wants to

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.089 
us the direction that the tool wants to
go<00:03:02.519> and<00:03:02.879> we're<00:03:03.239> going<00:03:03.329> to<00:03:03.450> use<00:03:03.720> that<00:03:03.989> and<00:03:04.260> let

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
go and we're going to use that and let

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.430 
go and we're going to use that and let
the<00:03:05.310> tool<00:03:05.489> go<00:03:05.700> that<00:03:05.940> direction<00:03:06.090> I'm<00:03:06.599> going<00:03:07.319> to

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
the tool go that direction I'm going to

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.330 
the tool go that direction I'm going to
look<00:03:07.620> at<00:03:07.950> that<00:03:09.530> you<00:03:10.530> need<00:03:10.709> to<00:03:10.829> know<00:03:10.950> where<00:03:11.310> that

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
look at that you need to know where that

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.160 
look at that you need to know where that
bevel<00:03:11.849> wants<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.180> go<00:03:12.359> and<00:03:12.629> I<00:03:12.690> need<00:03:12.870> it<00:03:12.959> to<00:03:13.049> be

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
bevel wants to go and I need it to be

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.930 
bevel wants to go and I need it to be
parallel<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.739> tourist<00:03:14.040> so<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.519> handle

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
parallel to the tourist so the handle

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.289 
parallel to the tourist so the handle
has<00:03:15.120> to<00:03:15.150> be<00:03:15.299> back<00:03:15.629> on<00:03:16.200> an<00:03:16.950> angle<00:03:17.250> like<00:03:17.280> this<00:03:17.640> if

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
has to be back on an angle like this if

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:19.970 
has to be back on an angle like this if
I'm<00:03:18.540> straight<00:03:18.870> in<00:03:19.079> the<00:03:19.230> bevel<00:03:19.500> it's<00:03:19.590> not<00:03:19.739> going

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
I'm straight in the bevel it's not going

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.229

sharp<00:04:24.780> edge<00:04:25.020> is<00:04:25.260> leading<00:04:25.680> the<00:04:25.800> way<00:04:25.980> the<00:04:26.669> bevel

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
sharp edge is leading the way the bevel

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.000 
sharp edge is leading the way the bevel
is<00:04:27.270> behind<00:04:27.690> and<00:04:28.050> the<00:04:28.590> handle<00:04:29.010> is<00:04:29.100> behind

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
is behind and the handle is behind

is behind and the handle is behind
that's<00:04:32.010> my<00:04:32.280> definition<00:04:32.520> of<00:04:33.000> a<00:04:33.120> pushing<00:04:33.510> cut

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
that's my definition of a pushing cut

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.440 
that's my definition of a pushing cut
alright<00:04:34.669> this<00:04:36.169> is<00:04:37.169> a<00:04:37.260> pushing<00:04:37.740> cut<00:04:38.150> it's<00:04:39.150> not

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
alright this is a pushing cut it's not

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.110 
alright this is a pushing cut it's not
my<00:04:39.690> arm<00:04:39.900> movements<00:04:40.470> it's<00:04:41.160> not<00:04:41.430> the<00:04:41.669> direction

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
my arm movements it's not the direction

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.500 
my arm movements it's not the direction
that<00:04:42.240> it's<00:04:42.390> going<00:04:42.630> on<00:04:42.870> the<00:04:43.169> wood<00:04:43.700> it's<00:04:44.700> the

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
that it's going on the wood it's the

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.450 
that it's going on the wood it's the
sharp<00:04:45.780> edge<00:04:45.990> leading<00:04:46.290> the<00:04:46.560> way<00:04:46.710> that<00:04:47.040> defines

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
sharp edge leading the way that defines

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.350 
sharp edge leading the way that defines
the<00:04:47.700> pushing<00:04:48.030> cut<00:04:48.650> okay<00:04:49.700> so<00:04:50.700> no<00:04:50.940> matter<00:04:51.090> what

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
the pushing cut okay so no matter what

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.730 
the pushing cut okay so no matter what
I'm<00:04:51.450> doing<00:04:51.479> with<00:04:51.810> my<00:04:51.840> hands<00:04:52.200> whether<00:04:52.500> I'm

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
I'm doing with my hands whether I'm

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.469 
I'm doing with my hands whether I'm
pushing<00:04:53.370> it<00:04:53.460> away<00:04:53.550> from<00:04:53.790> my<00:04:53.910> body<00:04:54.030> or<00:04:54.270> pulling

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
pushing it away from my body or pulling

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.330 
pushing it away from my body or pulling
it<00:04:54.630> towards<00:04:54.870> my<00:04:54.990> body<00:04:55.139> it's<00:04:55.740> still<00:04:55.979> a<00:04:56.010> pushing

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
it towards my body it's still a pushing

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.010 
it towards my body it's still a pushing
cut<00:04:56.520> if<00:04:56.639> the<00:04:56.760> sharp<00:04:57.030> edge<00:04:57.180> is<00:04:57.360> leading<00:04:57.780> the<00:04:57.870> way

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
cut if the sharp edge is leading the way

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.530 
cut if the sharp edge is leading the way
okay<00:04:58.919> so<00:04:59.490> I'm<00:04:59.610> gonna<00:04:59.700> do<00:04:59.880> the<00:04:59.970> same<00:05:00.120> thing<00:05:00.390> the

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
okay so I'm gonna do the same thing the

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.930 
okay so I'm gonna do the same thing the
sharp<00:05:00.810> edge<00:05:00.960> is<00:05:01.080> gonna<00:05:01.169> lead<00:05:01.410> the<00:05:01.560> way<00:05:01.940> into

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
sharp edge is gonna lead the way into

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.090 
sharp edge is gonna lead the way into
the<00:05:03.030> side<00:05:03.270> grain<00:05:03.540> but<00:05:04.169> instead<00:05:04.500> of<00:05:04.620> going<00:05:04.830> all

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
the side grain but instead of going all

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.570 
the side grain but instead of going all
the<00:05:05.550> way<00:05:05.580> down<00:05:06.030> and<00:05:06.740> truing<00:05:07.740> the<00:05:07.950> side<00:05:08.160> up<00:05:08.370> now

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
the way down and truing the side up now

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.090 
the way down and truing the side up now
I'm<00:05:08.790> going<00:05:09.060> to<00:05:09.180> take<00:05:09.390> small<00:05:09.690> stages<00:05:10.020> the<00:05:10.890> most

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
I'm going to take small stages the most

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.130 
I'm going to take small stages the most
important<00:05:11.610> part<00:05:11.820> of<00:05:11.970> these<00:05:12.090> cuts<00:05:12.419> is<00:05:12.600> the

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
important part of these cuts is the

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.320 
important part of these cuts is the
bevel<00:05:13.410> support<00:05:13.800> each<00:05:14.250> time<00:05:14.700> I<00:05:14.729> make<00:05:15.060> a<00:05:15.090> little

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
bevel support each time I make a little

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.700 
bevel support each time I make a little
notch<00:05:15.630> here<00:05:15.660> I'm<00:05:16.140> going<00:05:16.229> to<00:05:16.289> start<00:05:16.590> a<00:05:16.680> new

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
notch here I'm going to start a new

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.630 
notch here I'm going to start a new
bevel<00:05:17.100> support<00:05:17.460> and<00:05:18.560> work<00:05:19.560> my<00:05:19.740> way<00:05:19.919> into<00:05:20.490> the

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640 
bevel support and work my way into the

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.600 
bevel support and work my way into the
middle<00:05:20.820> knots<00:05:21.390> knots<00:05:21.750> nosh-nosh<00:05:22.050> notch<00:05:22.650> okay

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
middle knots knots nosh-nosh notch okay

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:34.540 
middle knots knots nosh-nosh notch okay
so<00:05:23.880> I<00:05:24.030> need<00:05:24.300> to<00:05:24.360> get<00:05:24.450> my<00:05:24.630> face<00:05:25.200> shield<00:05:25.470> on<00:05:25.650> here

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.070 

fluke<00:05:35.180> pointing<00:05:35.510> in<00:05:35.600> the<00:05:35.660> direction<00:05:35.690> I'm

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
fluke pointing in the direction I'm

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.240 
fluke pointing in the direction I'm
going<00:05:36.230> to<00:05:36.380> travel<00:05:37.570> 45-degree<00:05:38.570> twist<00:05:39.130> now<00:05:40.130> I'm

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 
going to travel 45-degree twist now I'm

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:41.650 
going to travel 45-degree twist now I'm
just<00:05:40.430> going<00:05:40.550> to<00:05:40.580> take<00:05:40.790> a<00:05:40.820> small<00:05:41.150> notch<00:05:41.390> at<00:05:41.600> a

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
just going to take a small notch at a

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:57.820 
just going to take a small notch at a
time<00:05:54.910> right<00:05:55.910> down<00:05:56.150> in<00:05:56.300> the<00:05:56.390> middle<00:05:56.680> now<00:05:57.680> we're

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
time right down in the middle now we're

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.550 
time right down in the middle now we're
gonna<00:05:57.980> stop<00:05:58.280> here<00:05:58.580> just<00:05:58.640> in<00:05:59.120> a<00:05:59.210> second<00:05:59.780> take

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
gonna stop here just in a second take

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.310 
gonna stop here just in a second take
maybe<00:06:00.800> one<00:06:01.070> more<00:06:01.280> cut<00:06:01.580> and<00:06:01.790> let's<00:06:02.750> talk<00:06:02.990> about

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:03.320 
maybe one more cut and let's talk about

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.080 
maybe one more cut and let's talk about
the<00:06:03.590> dynamics<00:06:04.100> going<00:06:04.250> on<00:06:04.400> let's<00:06:04.610> make<00:06:04.730> sure<00:06:04.790> we

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.090 
the dynamics going on let's make sure we

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.720 
the dynamics going on let's make sure we
totally<00:06:05.750> understand<00:06:06.280> what's<00:06:07.280> at<00:06:07.490> work<00:06:07.520> here

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:07.730 
totally understand what's at work here

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:12.580 
totally understand what's at work here
and<00:06:08.680> why<00:06:09.680> this<00:06:09.740> is<00:06:09.950> so<00:06:10.250> easy<00:06:10.430> I<00:06:11.410> mean<00:06:12.410> I<00:06:12.470> can

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
and why this is so easy I mean I can

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.710 
and why this is so easy I mean I can
have<00:06:12.740> a<00:06:12.770> 10<00:06:13.040> eat<00:06:13.430> a<00:06:13.460> sandwich<00:06:13.820> and<00:06:14.240> turn<00:06:14.450> a<00:06:14.480> bowl

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:14.720 
have a 10 eat a sandwich and turn a bowl

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:22.210 
have a 10 eat a sandwich and turn a bowl
at<00:06:14.900> the<00:06:15.020> same<00:06:15.230> time<00:06:15.500> here<00:06:16.330> all<00:06:17.330> right<00:06:21.220> now

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:22.220 
at the same time here all right now

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.770 
at the same time here all right now
let's<00:06:22.460> take<00:06:22.610> our<00:06:22.760> pencil<00:06:23.000> again<00:06:24.100> and<00:06:25.780> show

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:26.780 
let's take our pencil again and show

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.740 
let's take our pencil again and show
where<00:06:26.990> the<00:06:27.200> the<00:06:27.590> forces<00:06:28.040> are<00:06:28.190> happening<00:06:28.750> we

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:29.750 
where the the forces are happening we

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.170 
where the the forces are happening we
can<00:06:29.900> see<00:06:30.080> that<00:06:30.230> from<00:06:30.470> there<00:06:30.820> the<00:06:31.820> wood<00:06:32.030> is

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180 
can see that from there the wood is

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.920 
can see that from there the wood is
going<00:06:32.480> down<00:06:33.070> okay

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:34.930 
going down okay

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.040 
going down okay

the tool the flute is pointing in the
direction<00:06:39.080> we're<00:06:39.470> going<00:06:39.560> to<00:06:39.620> travel<00:06:39.890> we're

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:40.220 
direction we're going to travel we're

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.070 
direction we're going to travel we're
always<00:06:40.370> going<00:06:40.610> to<00:06:40.670> travel<00:06:41.060> from<00:06:41.270> the<00:06:41.330> rim<00:06:41.810> to

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 
always going to travel from the rim to

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.110 
always going to travel from the rim to
the<00:06:42.110> bottom<00:06:42.530> that's<00:06:43.100> downhill<00:06:43.700> to<00:06:43.790> my<00:06:43.910> grain

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:44.120 
the bottom that's downhill to my grain

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.720 
the bottom that's downhill to my grain
orientation<00:06:44.570> my<00:06:45.530> pencil<00:06:45.980> drift<00:06:46.220> again<00:06:46.400> right

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:46.730
