00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
was assuming this good light stuff on

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.429 
was assuming this good light stuff on
fire<00:02:15.329> when<00:02:15.629> you<00:02:15.659> hit<00:02:15.870> it<00:02:15.989> but<00:02:16.140> I've<00:02:16.290> already

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
fire when you hit it but I've already

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:18.410 
fire when you hit it but I've already
tested<00:02:16.890> it<00:02:16.950> out<00:02:17.069> and<00:02:17.250> it<00:02:17.340> appears<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:18.329> doesn't

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
tested it out and it appears it doesn't

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.059 
tested it out and it appears it doesn't
do<00:02:18.689> anything<00:02:19.230> or<00:02:19.439> maybe<00:02:19.620> that's<00:02:19.799> just<00:02:19.920> cause

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
do anything or maybe that's just cause

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.000 
do anything or maybe that's just cause
I'm<00:02:20.220> in<00:02:20.310> creative<00:02:21.030> but<00:02:21.299> as<00:02:21.540> you<00:02:21.659> can<00:02:21.780> see<00:02:22.019> it

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
I'm in creative but as you can see it

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.729 
I'm in creative but as you can see it
doesn't<00:02:23.280> surely<00:02:23.939> and<00:02:24.470> isn't<00:02:25.470> a<00:02:25.530> weapon

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
doesn't surely and isn't a weapon

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.819 
doesn't surely and isn't a weapon
because<00:02:26.189> it's<00:02:26.939> not<00:02:27.150> hurting<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:27.750> faster<00:02:28.709> than

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
because it's not hurting it faster than

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:31.759 
because it's not hurting it faster than
like<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.069> fit<00:02:30.109> if<00:02:31.109> you<00:02:31.200> see<00:02:31.349> what<00:02:31.470> I<00:02:31.500> mean<00:02:31.530> but

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.949 
like a fit if you see what I mean but
