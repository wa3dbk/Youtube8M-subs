00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
five seconds I guess that is the

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.420 
five seconds I guess that is the
bluetooth<00:01:54.750> pairing<00:01:54.960> button<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.740> basically

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.230 
protector on my iPhone or it's really
designed<00:02:47.300> that<00:02:47.690> way<00:02:48.160> but<00:02:49.160> anyway<00:02:49.640> there's<00:02:50.030> no

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
designed that way but anyway there's no

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.100 
designed that way but anyway there's no
lay<00:02:50.420> on<00:02:50.630> the<00:02:50.720> table<00:02:50.750> design<00:02:51.410> with<00:02:51.680> this<00:02:51.830> one<00:02:53.110> at

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
lay on the table design with this one at

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.580 
lay on the table design with this one at
the<00:02:54.800> back<00:02:54.950> I<00:02:55.250> like<00:02:55.760> the<00:02:55.940> new<00:02:56.330> logo<00:02:56.720> using<00:02:57.200> grape

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
the back I like the new logo using grape

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.280 
the back I like the new logo using grape
in<00:02:57.740> ear<00:02:57.890> it's<00:02:58.730> not<00:02:58.970> cheaply<00:02:59.360> painted<00:02:59.990> in<00:03:00.110> here

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
in ear it's not cheaply painted in here

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.580 
in ear it's not cheaply painted in here
so<00:03:00.560> it<00:03:00.860> will<00:03:01.070> not<00:03:01.100> just<00:03:01.460> fade<00:03:01.670> out<00:03:02.530> there's<00:03:03.530> a

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
so it will not just fade out there's a

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.560 
so it will not just fade out there's a
really<00:03:03.830> big<00:03:04.130> cut<00:03:04.400> out<00:03:04.580> for<00:03:04.850> the<00:03:04.940> camera<00:03:05.270> and

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
really big cut out for the camera and

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.740 
really big cut out for the camera and
the<00:03:05.660> flash<00:03:05.690> it's<00:03:06.670> actually<00:03:07.670> as<00:03:08.180> big<00:03:08.420> as<00:03:08.600> my

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
the flash it's actually as big as my

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.370 
the flash it's actually as big as my
thumb<00:03:09.910> so<00:03:10.910> the<00:03:11.120> case<00:03:11.330> will<00:03:11.540> definitely<00:03:12.170> not

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
thumb so the case will definitely not

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.770 
thumb so the case will definitely not
cost<00:03:12.770> washing<00:03:13.190> out<00:03:13.310> of<00:03:13.490> images<00:03:13.970> when<00:03:14.510> you<00:03:14.600> take

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
cost washing out of images when you take

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.730 
cost washing out of images when you take
pictures<00:03:15.080> so<00:03:15.500> I<00:03:16.370> guess<00:03:16.820> that's<00:03:17.060> a<00:03:17.150> good<00:03:17.300> thing

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
pictures so I guess that's a good thing

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.590 
pictures so I guess that's a good thing
there's<00:03:18.740> also<00:03:18.950> a<00:03:19.100> toggle<00:03:19.400> on<00:03:19.700> the<00:03:19.820> side<00:03:20.030> so<00:03:20.570> you

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
there's also a toggle on the side so you

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.200 
there's also a toggle on the side so you
can<00:03:20.750> switch<00:03:21.170> between<00:03:21.380> the<00:03:21.830> external<00:03:22.340> and<00:03:22.940> the

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 
can switch between the external and the

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.480 
can switch between the external and the
on-screen<00:03:23.600> keyboard<00:03:23.750> as<00:03:24.320> for<00:03:25.160> the<00:03:25.250> slide-out

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 
on-screen keyboard as for the slide-out

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.320 
on-screen keyboard as for the slide-out
keyboard<00:03:25.850> it<00:03:26.810> feels<00:03:27.260> 30<00:03:27.670> the<00:03:28.670> keys<00:03:28.910> are<00:03:29.150> laid

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.290 
keyboard it feels 30 the keys are laid
out<00:03:29.480> very<00:03:29.540> well<00:03:30.050> and<00:03:30.670> it<00:03:31.670> will<00:03:31.850> be<00:03:31.970> easy<00:03:32.150> to

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
out very well and it will be easy to

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.210 
out very well and it will be easy to
type<00:03:32.600> on<00:03:32.780> this<00:03:32.900> thing<00:03:33.170> because<00:03:33.560> of<00:03:33.710> the<00:03:34.040> bigger

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
should just focus on the alphanumeric

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.159 
should just focus on the alphanumeric
part<00:04:21.950> of<00:04:22.100> the<00:04:22.220> keyboard<00:04:22.400> like<00:04:23.330> making<00:04:24.080> the

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
keyboard layout and this one is much

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.860 
keyboard layout and this one is much
better<00:05:08.170> and<00:05:08.440> widely<00:05:09.250> spaced<00:05:09.490> I<00:05:09.840> like<00:05:10.840> that

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
better and widely spaced I like that

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.830 
better and widely spaced I like that
they<00:05:11.170> made<00:05:11.410> the<00:05:11.440> space<00:05:11.800> bar<00:05:12.070> really<00:05:12.610> wide<00:05:12.910> it

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
they made the space bar really wide it

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.960 
they made the space bar really wide it

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
backlit feature this is really useful at

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.890

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
the external and the on-screen keyboard

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:42.210 
the external and the on-screen keyboard

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:47.140 
really don't see myself using this

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.610 
really don't see myself using this
toggle<00:05:48.270> I'm<00:05:49.270> a<00:05:49.330> little<00:05:49.750> bit<00:05:49.900> disappointed

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
toggle I'm a little bit disappointed

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.440

that<00:05:50.830> there<00:05:51.010> is<00:05:51.070> no<00:05:51.250> tilting<00:05:51.700> feature<00:05:51.910> because

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
that there is no tilting feature because

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.050 
that there is no tilting feature because
I<00:05:52.660> saw<00:05:52.990> a<00:05:53.020> video<00:05:53.320> about<00:05:53.650> this<00:05:53.950> case<00:05:54.190> on<00:05:54.400> CS<00:05:54.820> and

I saw a video about this case on CS and
that<00:05:55.480> model<00:05:55.900> has<00:05:56.080> a<00:05:56.290> tilting<00:05:56.740> feature<00:05:56.920> I<00:05:57.310> guess

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.090 
that model has a tilting feature I guess

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.820 
that model has a tilting feature I guess
