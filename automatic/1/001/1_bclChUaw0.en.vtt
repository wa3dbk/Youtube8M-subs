possibility is the biggest thing was
primarily<00:00:56.850> thinking<00:00:57.300> about<00:00:57.570> how<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.620> could

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
primarily thinking about how I could

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.490 
primarily thinking about how I could
make<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.820> something<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.210> was<00:01:00.449> mine<00:01:00.719> instead

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
make it something that was mine instead

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.810 
make it something that was mine instead
of<00:01:01.680> just<00:01:01.829> buying<00:01:01.980> something<00:01:02.309> off<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.699> floor

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
of just buying something off the floor

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.509 
of just buying something off the floor
I've<00:01:03.570> kind<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.019> learned<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.530> it's<00:01:05.129> really

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
I've kind of learned that it's really

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.950 
I've kind of learned that it's really
about<00:01:05.640> your<00:01:05.820> imagination<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.510> not<00:01:06.659> doesn't

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
about your imagination and not doesn't

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.090 
about your imagination and not doesn't
always<00:01:07.080> have<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.320> be<00:01:07.439> about<00:01:07.530> your<00:01:07.770> wallet

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
always have to be about your wallet

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.560 
always have to be about your wallet

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
because some of the paint jobs get

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.480 
because some of the paint jobs get
pretty<00:01:09.810> pricey<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.950> be<00:01:11.040> kept<00:01:11.189> totally

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
pretty pricey and to be kept totally

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.539 
pretty pricey and to be kept totally
