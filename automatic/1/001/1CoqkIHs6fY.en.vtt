00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
modular armor hate this might have been

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.050 
modular armor hate this might have been
the<00:00:15.269> one<00:00:15.450> right<00:00:15.599> before<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:16.289> modular<00:00:16.710> armor

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
the one right before the modular armor

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.279 
the one right before the modular armor
but<00:00:18.060> I'm<00:00:18.150> not<00:00:18.359> one<00:00:18.510> hundred<00:00:18.600> percent<00:00:18.779> sure<00:00:19.080> on

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
but I'm not one hundred percent sure on

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.420 
but I'm not one hundred percent sure on
that<00:00:19.320> this<00:00:19.590> is<00:00:19.680> what<00:00:19.770> he<00:00:19.830> was<00:00:19.949> wearing<00:00:20.130> when<00:00:20.369> I

that this is what he was wearing when I
first<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:21.210> thought<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:21.960> was<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.199> classical

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619

which<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.760> kind<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.030> annoying<00:00:55.250> it's<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.309> only

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
which is kind of annoying it's the only

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.920 
which is kind of annoying it's the only
time<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.670> try<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.000> move<00:00:57.120> his<00:00:57.270> arm<00:00:57.420> up<00:00:57.690> or

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
time you try to move his arm up or

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.799 
time you try to move his arm up or
forward<00:00:58.770> especially<00:00:59.609> forward<00:01:00.149> it<00:01:00.239> pops<00:01:00.449> up<00:01:00.660> I

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
forward especially forward it pops up I

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.270 
forward especially forward it pops up I
may<00:01:00.960> just<00:01:01.230> take<00:01:01.379> cut<00:01:01.590> them<00:01:01.710> off<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.010> glue<00:01:02.160> them

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
may just take cut them off and glue them

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.189 
may just take cut them off and glue them
one<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.579> shoulders<00:01:02.969> also<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:03.840> one<00:01:04.019> over

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
one of the shoulders also this one over

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.590 
one of the shoulders also this one over
here<00:01:04.229> has<00:01:04.739> just<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.670> little<00:01:05.909> bit<00:01:06.000> this<00:01:06.270> this

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
here has just a little bit this this

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.240 
here has just a little bit this this
little<00:01:06.720> bit<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.320> connects<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:07.860> too<00:01:08.010> long

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
little bit that connects it is too long

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.710 
little bit that connects it is too long
so<00:01:08.580> it's<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.090> can<00:01:09.180> see<00:01:09.299> there's<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.510> gap

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
so it's that you can see there's a gap

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.200 
so it's that you can see there's a gap
there<00:01:10.010> now<00:01:11.010> I'm<00:01:11.130> unlike<00:01:11.369> on<00:01:11.520> this<00:01:11.700> side<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:11.909> I'm

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
there now I'm unlike on this side so I'm

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.550 
there now I'm unlike on this side so I'm
gonna<00:01:12.450> have<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.720> fiddle<00:01:13.020> with<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.229> at<00:01:13.380> some
