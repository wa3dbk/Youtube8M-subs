all the way through that just helps it

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.009 
all the way through that just helps it
to<00:02:34.010> maintain<00:02:34.820> the<00:02:35.090> waterproofness<00:02:35.660> of<00:02:35.930> the

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
to maintain the waterproofness of the

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.350
