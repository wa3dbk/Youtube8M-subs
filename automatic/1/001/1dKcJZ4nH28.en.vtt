00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
yard area he is very very good but his

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.339 
yard area he is very very good but his
penalty<00:02:52.799> stats<00:02:53.700> are<00:02:53.969> also<00:02:54.239> very<00:02:54.780> very<00:02:54.900> nice

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
penalty stats are also very very nice

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.890 
penalty stats are also very very nice
indeed<00:02:55.409> and<00:02:56.069> he<00:02:56.459> can't<00:02:56.849> keep<00:02:57.359> her<00:02:57.599> himself

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900

indeed and he can't keep her himself
composed<00:02:58.680> by<00:02:59.250> doing<00:02:59.819> a<00:03:00.000> light<00:03:00.389> chip<00:03:00.750> penalties

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
composed by doing a light chip penalties

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.920 
composed by doing a light chip penalties
or<00:03:01.530> pad<00:03:01.799> penalties<00:03:02.340> right<00:03:02.969> in<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.299> corner<00:03:03.510> and

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.949 
or pad penalties right in the corner and
but<00:03:04.919> definitely<00:03:05.669> a<00:03:05.699> great<00:03:06.090> long<00:03:06.389> shot<00:03:06.659> taker

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
but definitely a great long shot taker

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.929 
but definitely a great long shot taker
that<00:03:07.260> even<00:03:07.739> though<00:03:07.829> that<00:03:08.010> was<00:03:08.129> just<00:03:08.579> inside

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:08.939 
that even though that was just inside

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:11.929 
that even though that was just inside
the<00:03:08.969> box<00:03:09.449> he<00:03:10.049> can<00:03:10.319> hit<00:03:10.469> it<00:03:10.620> literally<00:03:11.280> right<00:03:11.730> on

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:11.939 
the box he can hit it literally right on

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:15.229 
the box he can hit it literally right on
top<00:03:12.480> net<00:03:12.780> of<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.049> goal<00:03:13.319> or<00:03:13.790> directly<00:03:14.790> in<00:03:15.090> the

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
top net of the goal or directly in the

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:16.909 
top net of the goal or directly in the
corners<00:03:15.659> so<00:03:16.049> you're<00:03:16.199> never<00:03:16.409> going<00:03:16.680> to<00:03:16.769> have<00:03:16.889> a

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:16.919 
corners so you're never going to have a

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:19.369 
corners so you're never going to have a
problem<00:03:17.189> of<00:03:17.579> him<00:03:17.790> with<00:03:18.629> his<00:03:18.750> long<00:03:19.019> shots

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 
problem of him with his long shots

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:23.149 
problem of him with his long shots
because<00:03:20.959> near<00:03:21.959> enough<00:03:22.260> like<00:03:22.620> I<00:03:22.799> would<00:03:22.980> say

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:23.159 
because near enough like I would say

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:25.429 
because near enough like I would say
seven<00:03:23.579> times<00:03:23.819> out<00:03:24.000> of<00:03:24.030> ten<00:03:24.449> they<00:03:24.930> will<00:03:25.109> go<00:03:25.260> in

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:25.439 
seven times out of ten they will go in

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:28.159 
seven times out of ten they will go in
but<00:03:26.099> also<00:03:26.310> he<00:03:26.819> has<00:03:26.939> a<00:03:26.969> very<00:03:27.239> very<00:03:27.569> nice<00:03:27.780> body

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:28.169 
but also he has a very very nice body

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:30.259 
but also he has a very very nice body
and<00:03:28.409> from<00:03:28.889> this<00:03:29.280> is<00:03:29.459> probably<00:03:29.639> the<00:03:29.819> best<00:03:30.000> clip

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
and from this is probably the best clip

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.280
