00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
doing brake master cylinder and brake

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.870 
doing brake master cylinder and brake
booster<00:00:06.890> so<00:00:07.890> I'll<00:00:08.069> show<00:00:08.280> you<00:00:08.340> guys<00:00:08.460> how<00:00:08.639> to<00:00:08.670> do

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
booster so I'll show you guys how to do

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.160 
booster so I'll show you guys how to do
that<00:00:09.059> it's<00:00:09.559> really<00:00:10.559> easy<00:00:10.590> to<00:00:10.980> do<00:00:11.929> tools<00:00:12.929> you're

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
that it's really easy to do tools you're

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.010 
that it's really easy to do tools you're
going<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.349> need<00:00:13.590> is<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:13.889> 10<00:00:14.250> middle<00:00:14.610> wrench<00:00:15.480> for

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
going to need is a 10 middle wrench for

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.040 
going to need is a 10 middle wrench for
the<00:00:16.289> brake<00:00:16.500> lines<00:00:18.020> and<00:00:19.020> then<00:00:19.590> I<00:00:19.680> think<00:00:19.920> 12<00:00:20.640> mil

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
the brake lines and then I think 12 mil

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.920 
the brake lines and then I think 12 mil
socket<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:23.160> ratchet<00:00:23.189> for<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.240> inside<00:00:24.689> of

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
socket and a ratchet for the inside of

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.920 
socket and a ratchet for the inside of
the<00:00:25.019> brake<00:00:25.230> booster<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:26.510> I<00:00:27.510> think<00:00:27.750> that's

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
the brake booster and I think that's

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.230 
the brake booster and I think that's
about<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.170> if<00:00:29.039> all<00:00:29.340> you're<00:00:29.519> replacing<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.150> the

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
about it if all you're replacing is the

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.269 
about it if all you're replacing is the
master<00:00:30.599> cylinder<00:00:30.779> all<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.380> do<00:00:31.500> is<00:00:31.619> unbolt<00:00:31.800> the

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
master cylinder all you do is unbolt the

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.130 
master cylinder all you do is unbolt the
four<00:00:32.520> bolts<00:00:32.880> here<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.420> in<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.690> brake<00:00:33.870> lines

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
four bolts here and in the brake lines

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.680 
four bolts here and in the brake lines
and<00:00:34.380> pop<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.770> off<00:00:34.920> put<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.880> new<00:00:35.940> one<00:00:36.149> on<00:00:36.300> and

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
and pop it off put the new one on and

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.310 
and pop it off put the new one on and
then<00:00:37.649> that's<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.780> so<00:00:39.780> I'll<00:00:39.870> show<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.110> guys<00:00:40.200> how

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
then that's it so I'll show you guys how

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.750 
then that's it so I'll show you guys how
to<00:00:40.730> change<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.960> booster<00:00:42.960> master<00:00:43.440> cylinder<00:00:43.800> on

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
to change a booster master cylinder on

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.590 
to change a booster master cylinder on
these<00:00:45.120> Toyota's<00:00:45.620> they're<00:00:46.620> all<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.730> same<00:00:47.760> if

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
these Toyota's they're all the same if

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.959 
these Toyota's they're all the same if
you've<00:00:48.719> done<00:00:48.930> one<00:00:49.140> you've<00:00:49.350> done<00:00:49.530> them<00:00:49.649> all<00:00:49.969> the

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
you've done one you've done them all the

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.080 
you've done one you've done them all the
thing<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.270> like<00:00:51.449> about<00:00:51.480> these<00:00:52.199> vehicles

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
thing I like about these vehicles

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.639 
thing I like about these vehicles
particularly<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.780> don't<00:00:55.020> have<00:00:55.440> to

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
particularly is that you don't have to

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.470 
particularly is that you don't have to
rip<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.070> dash<00:00:56.250> out<00:00:56.550> or<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.000> steering<00:00:57.300> column

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
rip the dash out or the steering column

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.779 
rip the dash out or the steering column
out<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.960> do<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.199> for<00:00:58.980> your<00:00:59.100> 12<00:00:59.340> mil<00:00:59.579> you're

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
out to do it for your 12 mil you're

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.119 
out to do it for your 12 mil you're
going<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.030> want<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.329> be<00:01:00.539> as<00:01:00.840> ball<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:01.980> deep

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
going to want it to be as ball and deep

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.299 
going to want it to be as ball and deep
socket<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:02.940> because<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.680> studs<00:01:04.949> on<00:01:05.159> the

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
socket so because the the studs on the

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.520 
socket so because the the studs on the
brake<00:01:05.670> booster<00:01:06.140> they're<00:01:07.140> pretty<00:01:07.320> long

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
brake booster they're pretty long

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.170 
brake booster they're pretty long
freaking<00:01:08.369> stuff<00:01:08.549> with<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.729> brake<00:01:08.880> lines

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
freaking stuff with the brake lines

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.219 
freaking stuff with the brake lines
we're<00:01:09.479> going<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.659> leave<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:09.960> one<00:01:10.200> alone

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
we're going to leave this one alone

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.609 
we're going to leave this one alone
because<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.850> just<00:01:12.210> runs<00:01:12.479> into<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.080> tee<00:01:13.380> there

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
because it just runs into that tee there

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.130 
because it just runs into that tee there
so<00:01:13.770> we<00:01:13.860> got<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.070> do<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.220> one<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:15.600> one<00:01:15.900> and

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
so we got to do that one that one and

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.550 
so we got to do that one that one and
that<00:01:16.549> one<00:01:17.549> if<00:01:18.030> you've<00:01:18.659> got<00:01:18.840> them<00:01:19.080> it's<00:01:19.229> best<00:01:19.439> to

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
that one if you've got them it's best to

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.270 
that one if you've got them it's best to
use<00:01:19.650> line<00:01:20.100> wrenches<00:01:20.610> but<00:01:21.479> if<00:01:22.009> you<00:01:23.009> don't

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
use line wrenches but if you don't

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.820 
use line wrenches but if you don't
because<00:01:23.880> either<00:01:24.299> they<00:01:24.509> grew<00:01:24.720> legs<00:01:25.020> or<00:01:25.409> you

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
because either they grew legs or you

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.819 
because either they grew legs or you
just<00:01:25.920> don't<00:01:26.100> have<00:01:26.340> any<00:01:26.869> you<00:01:27.869> can<00:01:28.110> use<00:01:28.320> an<00:01:28.530> open

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
just don't have any you can use an open

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.319 
just don't have any you can use an open
end<00:01:29.009> but<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.490> got<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.700> be<00:01:29.759> careful<00:01:29.970> because

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
end but you got to be careful because

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.840 
end but you got to be careful because
especially<00:01:31.320> if<00:01:31.380> you're<00:01:31.500> reusing<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.700> brake

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
especially if you're reusing the brake

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.160 
especially if you're reusing the brake
fittings<00:01:33.210> if<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.390> don't<00:01:33.540> want<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.780> run<00:01:33.930> new

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
fittings if you don't want to run new

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.850 
fittings if you don't want to run new

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
careful not to strip them alright with

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.280 
careful not to strip them alright with
our<00:01:43.860> brakes<00:01:44.220> our<00:01:44.790> brake<00:01:45.030> lines<00:01:45.329> disconnected

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
our brakes our brake lines disconnected

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.410 
our brakes our brake lines disconnected
you<00:01:46.860> might<00:01:46.979> want<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.280> put<00:01:47.490> down<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.850> rag<00:01:48.210> or

you might want to put down a rag or

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.399 
you might want to put down a rag or
something<00:01:48.479> so<00:01:48.780> they<00:01:48.840> don't<00:01:48.990> get<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.200> on<00:01:49.290> your

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
something so they don't get it on your

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.100 
something so they don't get it on your
paint<00:01:49.680> but<00:01:49.979> it's<00:01:50.759> not<00:01:50.909> like<00:01:51.119> this<00:01:51.750> trucks

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
paint but it's not like this trucks

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.929 
paint but it's not like this trucks
really<00:01:52.380> in<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.740> greatest<00:01:53.189> shape<00:01:53.399> so<00:01:53.700> not

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
really in that greatest shape so not

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.810 
really in that greatest shape so not
really<00:01:54.299> worried<00:01:54.570> about<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.950> but<00:01:55.950> grab<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.549> pair

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
really worried about it but grab a pair

last<00:02:45.870> start<00:02:46.870> with<00:02:47.049> the<00:02:47.170> hardest<00:02:47.530> to<00:02:47.620> get<00:02:47.739> to

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
last start with the hardest to get to

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.910 
last start with the hardest to get to
one<00:02:48.130> and<00:02:48.340> then<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:48.879> next<00:02:49.180> one<00:02:49.360> and<00:02:49.569> then<00:02:50.530> work

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
one and then the next one and then work

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.580 
one and then the next one and then work
your<00:02:51.099> way<00:02:51.190> from<00:02:51.250> hardest<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:52.360> easiest<00:02:52.989> because

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
your way from hardest to easiest because

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
your way from hardest to easiest because
as<00:02:54.099> you<00:02:55.170> work<00:02:56.170> on<00:02:56.349> the<00:02:56.470> last<00:02:56.709> bolt<00:02:57.069> if<00:02:57.400> you

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
as you work on the last bolt if you

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.569 
as you work on the last bolt if you
leave<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:57.940> hardest<00:02:58.329> one<00:02:58.620> till<00:02:59.620> last<00:02:59.920> the

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
leave the hardest one till last the

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:02.610 
leave the hardest one till last the
brake<00:03:00.849> booster<00:03:01.030> will<00:03:01.420> start<00:03:01.660> backing<00:03:02.079> off<00:03:02.379> and

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
brake booster will start backing off and

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.819 
brake booster will start backing off and
it<00:03:02.680> just<00:03:02.709> gets<00:03:03.040> harder<00:03:03.430> so<00:03:04.470> now<00:03:05.470> all<00:03:05.680> that's

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
it just gets harder so now all that's

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:11.430 
it just gets harder so now all that's
left<00:03:06.099> to<00:03:06.160> do<00:03:06.370> is<00:03:07.590> give<00:03:08.590> her<00:03:08.709> a<00:03:08.739> little<00:03:08.920> pull<00:03:10.440> and

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
left to do is give her a little pull and

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:19.940 
left to do is give her a little pull and
slide<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:12.250> pin<00:03:12.430> out<00:03:14.310> now<00:03:15.310> she'll<00:03:15.639> just<00:03:15.850> follow

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.349 

unless<00:03:20.950> the<00:03:21.280> brake<00:03:21.489> lines<00:03:21.790> are<00:03:22.000> in<00:03:22.120> the<00:03:22.239> way

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
unless the brake lines are in the way

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:25.170

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
sensing proportioning valve a lot of the

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:10.390 
sensing proportioning valve a lot of the
times<00:05:08.410> because<00:05:09.410> they're<00:05:09.830> under<00:05:10.070> the<00:05:10.160> frame

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
times because they're under the frame

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.659 
times because they're under the frame
and<00:05:10.639> exposed<00:05:11.539> to<00:05:11.720> everything<00:05:12.400> you<00:05:13.400> end<00:05:13.520> up

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
snapping that bleeder off and then it's

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.330 
snapping that bleeder off and then it's
frickin<00:05:17.330> useless<00:05:18.050> so<00:05:18.380> what<00:05:18.560> I<00:05:18.590> end<00:05:18.889> up<00:05:18.950> doing

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
frickin useless so what I end up doing

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.550 
frickin useless so what I end up doing
is<00:05:20.169> it's<00:05:21.169> a<00:05:21.260> little<00:05:21.410> bit<00:05:21.500> of<00:05:21.800> a<00:05:22.000> job<00:05:23.000> to<00:05:23.560> bypass

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
is it's a little bit of a job to bypass

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.290 
is it's a little bit of a job to bypass
it<00:05:24.830> because<00:05:24.979> it's<00:05:25.130> got<00:05:25.250> a<00:05:25.280> return<00:05:25.639> line<00:05:25.940> or

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
it because it's got a return line or

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.240 
it because it's got a return line or
secondary<00:05:27.080> feed<00:05:27.349> line<00:05:27.620> or<00:05:27.860> something<00:05:28.160> like

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
secondary feed line or something like

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.830 
secondary feed line or something like
that<00:05:28.660> but<00:05:30.099> basically<00:05:31.099> when<00:05:31.610> I<00:05:31.639> go<00:05:31.910> to<00:05:31.970> redo<00:05:32.510> I

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
that but basically when I go to redo I

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.170 
that but basically when I go to redo I
when<00:05:33.710> I<00:05:33.740> go<00:05:33.889> to<00:05:33.950> add<00:05:34.130> rear<00:05:34.430> disc<00:05:34.700> brakes<00:05:34.970> to

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
when I go to add rear disc brakes to

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.330 
when I go to add rear disc brakes to
this<00:05:35.300> thing<00:05:35.570> I'm<00:05:35.720> going<00:05:35.840> to<00:05:35.900> be<00:05:36.340> freaking
