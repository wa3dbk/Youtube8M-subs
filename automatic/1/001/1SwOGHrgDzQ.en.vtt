 yes above all good yes gentlemen what 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.549
 so much mariani asking for a game of 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.289
 black ops 2 but not special game 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.800
 because I'm not using the typical and 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:21.890
 Fucked weapon of the well-known game call 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.990
 of black machine gun ops no no 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.820
 I'm using the fal but with 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.410
 choice of shots I have it over 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.300
 automatic that is a piece of weapon in 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.560
 seriously I'm finally dying very 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.860
 well he threw all the sexual themes 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.629
 encompasses this weapon is long powerful these 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.860
 themes but good 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:38.329
 it's a game that I really do not know 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.040
 what happened I think this one learns to play 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.390
 because I'm a full team but there's 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.600
 everything first of departure is that there is one 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.280
 in the end against carmen s 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.540
 he thought that the car was going to cushion his 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.880
 fall but had not been a 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.590
 golpazo and if I wanted to wish you a happy 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.660
 Christmas a little delayed a happy year 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.160
 I'm preparing a special video like that 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.649
 As you remember, I did not know about 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.090
 reflections or came now I'm going to do 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.350
 reflection a reflection for the purpose of 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.000
 year for you to have a good time 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.620
 because I have had a great time not 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.390
 I know how you passed it you're fuck or not 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.009
 failed that is a theme of you be 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.600
 my friend there is all chili at the side but 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:10.310
 good here something interesting will happen 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.870
 it starts everything first that started me 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.270
 going down that guy that surprised us 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.280
 because it's great my partner dies 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.080
 I do not know why there was not a whole 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.610
 set of Spain all chilling and here 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.260
 I already stay alone they kill all my 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.270
 I was left alone because 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.800
 I hear that tragic voice and also 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.240
 complicity a little we keep my 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.320
 friends that do not kill me in the back 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.760
 because there has to be 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.010
 killed but good here I hear the voice 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.750
 it brought that others are dead are 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.670
 all dead and now I usually stay 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.560
 like everything in Chile but if I do not know what 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.900
 happens but what is left alive and surprising 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.030
 I win and I do and pnv last one thing that 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.490
 they are not going to see it very often and I also 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.470
 like the last servef out there I put on 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.880
 look at this youtube friends and then 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.680
 clearly I love it I have been left 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.300
 for a very beautiful youtube logo 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.280
 so they wonder what came in the 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.100
 weapon also I do not know whether to put red sights 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.830
 because right now I have what is the cylinder head 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.650
 so you can contribute faster where 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.570
 He lives like this but not the support so that 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.340
 do not move much and obviously choose 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.140
 shots I do not know what to really get 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.730
 but well this round here is 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.590
 interesting because obviously as you know 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.700
 his pants always has fails he's never going 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.040
 to see for example that at some point 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.570
 no and here we have it because I let my 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.550
 peers pass you know a decoy 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.900
 the decoy man of that easy 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.159
 that see a man that is 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:24.829
 he also has a shield so be 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:26.689
 defend a little head for like racists 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:28.310
 get out like that hit him know god why and not 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:30.200
 I know that here I am spending bullets and 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.720
 I'm also defining my area by taking 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.090
 this pants are going to kill him but it's 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.069
 a good round because he managed to plant the 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.659
 pump me though you're going to kill me be a 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.629
 spoiler will kill me a little bit will 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:43.340
 kill as he must kill me 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.170
 we managed to give one because the bomb explodes 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.970
 and really here is when I say what 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.400
 important to say for the objectives 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.440
 because really this black ops is more 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.760
 focused on points in game in teams 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.220
 I do not know what you have, I see it like that 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.510
 is very very focused on the fact that 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.159
 we go for the objectives 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.109
 because they give you many points really 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:02.389
 they come out earning too much when you go 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:04.150
 two points is a barbarian thing prisoner 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:06.079
 how to play how will you confirm 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.000
 demolition hot spot are 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.709
 spectacular to take a game 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.420
 spectacular that attack is fine 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.189
 lightning that pulled me out do not sing victory 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.840
 because it 's lightning attack is going to be a 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:17.030
 thing that is going to shit to make a 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.430
 my typical typical thing we see that the 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.620
 shield that flee as well as look straight 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.120
 I thought he had stayed in the 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.200
 corner because obviously the shield and 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.200
 valdesquÃ­ shots 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.180
 for this fire and that putt that's going to 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.040
 kill I do not know where the way the 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.599
 turn that I honestly did not know 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.180
 as if a lap that took but my 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.620
 brother nor his anal stimulation of me 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.269
 did everything is going to have written that I 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.830
 they ate dies that I did not realize that 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.830
 the partner had died and does not come 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.599
 we are less shots like crazy jumps and 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.760
 see to the right and possible we kill but 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:49.519
 It is too late for the Lord present 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.040
 that is not going to be able in this case 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:54.769
 function can invite me to the pump and 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.080
 we won the third round is here and it goes 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.400
 to be a complete fake really like 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.560
 you like the new games and 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.230
 all exciting mind fails because 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.170
 look is slow so much rain I 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.910
 ok ready I let myself go I'm going to throw the 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.519
 lightning attack for not killing a fucking 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.440
 God did not kill anyone typical of me and I'm going to 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.239
 say one thing I did not know I do not know no 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.860
 I knew that in this guy they can not do 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.709
 things automatically that's why 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.269
 Speaking of seconds left to pass 8 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.090
 so all equally I stay there all 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:26.860
 let's launch download it let's see 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.860
 how is it going I threw it did not miss a second 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.890
 God is going to kill me with the weapon that is 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.960
 fashionable now now everyone that 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.300
 use the equivocal file as balls 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.040
 call the one that was the f 9 of the demos 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:44.860
 warfare 3 but now they have done it 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.860
 rafa mind and it kills me 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:51.380
 some day when it's good playing 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.210
 you shit that guys and we got to the 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.530
 last round a round that really 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.050
 like because if we had a beginning 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.440
 difficult we have to finish as 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.060
 should 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.280
 obviously there is not a fort but with the 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.580
 death chamber all pretty all water 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.840
 for everyone as you like 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.330
 sexually active hatreds that have more 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.010
 I have been told by many people that I should 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.460
 leave the subject of sexuality but it is 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.460
 what do you like 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.760
 that blue jump is because I 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.230
 capture now I wanted to stop recording 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.690

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.130

 is to spend it as a family but not that I have
