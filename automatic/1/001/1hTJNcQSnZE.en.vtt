00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
to be vacated by lintel what I mean by

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.359 
to be vacated by lintel what I mean by
violently<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.799> move<00:01:23.009> should<00:01:23.189> not

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
violently is that the move should not

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.969 
violently is that the move should not
allow<00:01:23.670> your<00:01:23.909> opponent<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.930> gain<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.170> tempo<00:01:25.710> to

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
allow your opponent to gain a tempo to

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.940 
allow your opponent to gain a tempo to
reposition<00:01:26.400> his<00:01:26.640> pieces<00:01:27.470> for<00:01:28.470> example<00:01:28.860> if

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
reposition his pieces for example if

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.969 
reposition his pieces for example if
black<00:01:29.159> plays<00:01:29.400> something<00:01:29.640> like<00:01:29.909> Queen<00:01:30.210> d8<00:01:30.979> then

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
black plays something like Queen d8 then

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.590 
black plays something like Queen d8 then
Wyatt<00:01:32.250> gets<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.759> move<00:01:32.909> one<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.150> his<00:01:33.390> knights

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
Wyatt gets to move one of his knights

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.670 
Wyatt gets to move one of his knights
and<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.500> foking<00:01:34.860> opportunity<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.610> lost

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
and the foking opportunity is lost

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.289 
and the foking opportunity is lost
hence<00:01:37.680> black<00:01:38.009> should<00:01:38.250> play<00:01:38.460> Queen<00:01:39.000> captures

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
hence black should play Queen captures

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.929 
hence black should play Queen captures
Queen<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.710> white<00:01:40.979> has<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.610> recapture

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
Queen so that white has to recapture

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.410 
Queen so that white has to recapture
with<00:01:42.210> his<00:01:42.329> team<00:01:43.460> now<00:01:44.460> black<00:01:44.759> can<00:01:44.790> comfortably

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
with his team now black can comfortably

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:52.539 
with his team now black can comfortably
play<00:01:45.720> f6<00:01:49.460> here<00:01:50.460> again<00:01:50.759> it's<00:01:51.540> white<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:52.079> play

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
play f6 here again it's white to play

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.490 
play f6 here again it's white to play
usually<00:01:53.549> when<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.759> bishop<00:01:54.180> or<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.450> queen<00:01:54.780> is<00:01:55.020> one

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
usually when a bishop or a queen is one

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.050 
usually when a bishop or a queen is one
of<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.710> pieces<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.369> intend<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.759> folk

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
of the pieces that you intend to folk

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.450 
of the pieces that you intend to folk
with<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.360> pawn<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:58.530> need<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.860> make<00:01:59.009> sure<00:01:59.040> that

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
with a pawn you need to make sure that

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.910 
with a pawn you need to make sure that
the<00:01:59.700> pawn<00:01:59.909> is<00:01:59.939> protected<00:02:00.710> otherwise<00:02:01.710> the

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
the pawn is protected otherwise the

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.830 
the pawn is protected otherwise the
bishop<00:02:02.219> can<00:02:02.369> just<00:02:02.610> capture<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.240> then

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
bishop can just capture it and then

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.190 
bishop can just capture it and then
there's<00:02:04.079> no<00:02:04.200> folk<00:02:04.500> anymore<00:02:05.479> in<00:02:06.479> this<00:02:06.689> position

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
there's no folk anymore in this position

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.460 
there's no folk anymore in this position
however<00:02:07.799> blacks<00:02:08.670> Bishop<00:02:09.090> this<00:02:09.209> pin<00:02:09.479> if<00:02:09.780> it

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
however blacks Bishop this pin if it

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.680 
however blacks Bishop this pin if it
moves<00:02:10.739> Y<00:02:11.459> it<00:02:11.520> simply<00:02:11.879> plays<00:02:12.120> rook<00:02:12.420> captures

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
moves Y it simply plays rook captures

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.850 
moves Y it simply plays rook captures
room

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
room

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.400 
room
so<00:02:14.160> since<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.550> bishop<00:02:14.850> is<00:02:15.000> pinned<00:02:15.300> white<00:02:16.200> can

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
so since the bishop is pinned white can

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:25.430 
so since the bishop is pinned white can
play<00:02:16.440> d5<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.450> win<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.480> piece<00:02:23.750> again<00:02:24.750> I<00:02:24.960> would

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
play d5 and win a piece again I would

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.410 
play d5 and win a piece again I would
like<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.770> emphasize<00:02:26.310> on<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.640> fact<00:02:26.910> that

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
like to emphasize on the fact that

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.330 
like to emphasize on the fact that
whenever<00:02:27.600> a<00:02:27.780> bishop<00:02:28.200> or<00:02:28.380> queen<00:02:28.740> is<00:02:28.980> one<00:02:29.160> of<00:02:29.250> the

whenever a bishop or queen is one of the

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.910 
whenever a bishop or queen is one of the
pieces<00:02:29.550> that<00:02:29.910> you<00:02:30.030> want<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.330> poke<00:02:30.630> you<00:02:31.560> need<00:02:31.740> to

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
pieces that you want to poke you need to

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.430 
pieces that you want to poke you need to
make<00:02:32.100> sure<00:02:32.130> that<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.670> pawn<00:02:32.880> is<00:02:33.060> protected<00:02:33.660> if

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
make sure that the pawn is protected if

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.520 
make sure that the pawn is protected if
white<00:02:35.070> plays<00:02:35.280> F<00:02:35.610> for<00:02:35.970> straight<00:02:36.270> away<00:02:36.530> black

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
white plays F for straight away black

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.500 
white plays F for straight away black
can<00:02:37.770> simply<00:02:38.130> take<00:02:38.310> it<00:02:38.520> with<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.060> bishop<00:02:39.390> and

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
can simply take it with the bishop and

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.130 
can simply take it with the bishop and
the<00:02:40.470> opportunity<00:02:41.070> is<00:02:41.190> lost<00:02:42.140> another

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
the opportunity is lost another

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.080 
the opportunity is lost another
point<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:43.620> be<00:02:43.650> kept<00:02:43.920> in<00:02:44.040> mind<00:02:44.070> is<00:02:44.490> that

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
point to be kept in mind is that

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.300 
point to be kept in mind is that
sometimes<00:02:45.570> a<00:02:45.780> check<00:02:46.200> can<00:02:46.500> we<00:02:46.650> use<00:02:46.800> to<00:02:47.070> get<00:02:47.190> your

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
sometimes a check can we use to get your

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.540 
sometimes a check can we use to get your
pieces<00:02:47.550> out<00:02:47.940> of<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.300> book<00:02:49.070> okay<00:02:50.070> anyway<00:02:50.400> let's

pieces out of a book okay anyway let's

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.600 
pieces out of a book okay anyway let's
get<00:02:50.730> back<00:02:50.790> to<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.180> position<00:02:51.630> so<00:02:52.350> f4<00:02:53.160> doesn't

work and g3 followed by f4 is too slow

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.600 
work and g3 followed by f4 is too slow
but<00:02:57.900> gives<00:02:58.110> black<00:02:58.350> plenty<00:02:59.040> of<00:02:59.100> time<00:02:59.310> save

these pieces in fact you can even

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.230 
these pieces in fact you can even
inflict<00:03:02.520> the<00:03:02.640> check<00:03:02.880> on<00:03:03.120> d4<00:03:04.459> so<00:03:05.459> that's<00:03:05.820> not<00:03:06.030> a

now let's go back and see what happens

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.130 
now let's go back and see what happens
