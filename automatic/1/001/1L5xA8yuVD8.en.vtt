a<00:00:00.060> Bermuda<00:00:00.570> Triangle<00:00:01.020> in<00:00:01.170> space<00:00:01.500> sounds<00:00:02.040> so

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
a Bermuda Triangle in space sounds so

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.490 
a Bermuda Triangle in space sounds so
ridiculous<00:00:02.790> it's<00:00:03.179> like<00:00:03.300> a<00:00:03.330> bad<00:00:03.600> sci-fi<00:00:03.959> movie

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
ridiculous it's like a bad sci-fi movie

of<00:00:04.650> course<00:00:04.680> there<00:00:05.069> isn't<00:00:05.310> one<00:00:05.400> in<00:00:05.640> Bermuda

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
of course there isn't one in Bermuda

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.860 
of course there isn't one in Bermuda
it's<00:00:06.569> over<00:00:06.779> South<00:00:06.990> America<00:00:11.660> hey<00:00:12.660> there

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
it's over South America hey there

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.959 
it's over South America hey there

nothing really spooky going on here but

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.200 
nothing really spooky going on here but
there<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.440> place<00:00:43.800> in<00:00:44.040> space<00:00:44.430> where<00:00:44.879> Space
