00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.130 
up debris which i think is pretty cool
we<00:01:08.460> never<00:01:08.640> had<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:08.850> for<00:01:09.180> our<00:01:09.270> pool<00:01:09.510> or<00:01:09.810> our

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
we never had that for our pool or our

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.260 
we never had that for our pool or our
previous<00:01:10.710> pools<00:01:10.979> which<00:01:11.610> we've<00:01:11.820> had<00:01:12.030> some<00:01:12.210> of

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
previous pools which we've had some of

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.590 
previous pools which we've had some of
these<00:01:12.390> Intex<00:01:12.960> easy<00:01:13.260> set<00:01:13.590> pools<00:01:13.890> but<00:01:14.479> we<00:01:15.479> also

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
these Intex easy set pools but we also

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.810 
these Intex easy set pools but we also
had<00:01:15.869> one<00:01:15.900> with<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.290> round<00:01:16.530> metal<00:01:16.950> post<00:01:17.340> or<00:01:17.610> the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
had one with the round metal post or the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
had one with the round metal post or the
metal<00:01:18.180> post<00:01:19.310> for<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.369> pool<00:01:20.580> instead<00:01:21.000> but<00:01:21.659> I

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
metal post for the pool instead but I

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.899 
metal post for the pool instead but I
like<00:01:22.200> these<00:01:22.380> easy<00:01:23.189> set<00:01:23.460> pools<00:01:23.700> because

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
like these easy set pools because

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.940 
like these easy set pools because
they're<00:01:24.030> easy<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.360> set<00:01:24.570> up<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:25.080> lot<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.770> fun

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
they're easy to set up and a lot of fun

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.510 
they're easy to set up and a lot of fun
so<00:01:26.310> it's<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.420> 15<00:01:27.840> by<00:01:28.049> 42<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.799> its<00:01:28.920> largest<00:01:29.280> pool

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
so it's a 15 by 42 and its largest pool

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.410 
so it's a 15 by 42 and its largest pool
we've<00:01:29.670> ever<00:01:29.909> had

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
we've ever had

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.090 
we've ever had
we<00:01:32.049> don't<00:01:32.229> we<00:01:32.530> don't<00:01:32.619> have<00:01:32.710> that<00:01:32.920> bigger

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
we don't we don't have that bigger

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.330 
we don't we don't have that bigger
property<00:01:33.670> so<00:01:34.530> we<00:01:35.530> tried<00:01:35.770> to<00:01:35.859> get<00:01:35.950> the<00:01:36.070> biggest

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
property so we tried to get the biggest

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.520 
property so we tried to get the biggest
bull<00:01:36.460> we<00:01:36.549> can<00:01:36.700> that<00:01:36.850> would<00:01:37.000> take<00:01:37.270> up<00:01:37.420> the<00:01:37.719> least

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
bull we can that would take up the least

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.859 
bull we can that would take up the least
amount<00:01:38.829> of<00:01:38.950> space<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:40.119> we<00:01:40.329> found<00:01:40.479> this<00:01:40.659> and

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
amount of space and we found this and

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.980 
amount of space and we found this and
Craig's<00:01:41.049> us<00:01:41.460> it's<00:01:42.460> pretty<00:01:42.579> nice<00:01:42.850> but<00:01:43.719> what<00:01:43.869> we

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
Craig's us it's pretty nice but what we

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.959 
Craig's us it's pretty nice but what we
did<00:01:44.109> is<00:01:44.259> we<00:01:44.289> put<00:01:44.409> sand<00:01:44.890> down<00:01:45.219> and<00:01:45.640> if<00:01:45.759> you<00:01:45.850> can

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:45.969 
did is we put sand down and if you can

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:48.719
