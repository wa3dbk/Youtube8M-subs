00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.100 
into the UI as well but now you can run
off<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:43.670> he'll<00:01:44.670> stay<00:01:44.939> there<00:01:45.149> staring<00:01:45.840> at<00:01:45.960> me

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
off and he'll stay there staring at me

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.819 
off and he'll stay there staring at me
and<00:01:46.470> if<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.189> tell<00:01:47.340> them<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.549> come<00:01:48.649> he'll<00:01:49.649> hop

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
and if I tell them to come he'll hop

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.109 
and if I tell them to come he'll hop
right<00:01:50.009> on<00:01:50.040> over<00:01:50.360> and<00:01:51.360> there<00:01:51.509> is<00:01:51.829> so<00:01:53.119> that's

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
right on over and there is so that's

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.690 
right on over and there is so that's
something<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.509> should<00:01:55.350> be<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:56.250> know<00:01:56.369> this

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
something that should be you know this

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.069 
something that should be you know this
is<00:01:56.820> this<00:01:56.909> was<00:01:57.030> an<00:01:57.119> easy<00:01:57.299> script<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.750> make<00:01:57.899> it

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
is this was an easy script to make it

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.020 
is this was an easy script to make it
was<00:01:58.170> not<00:01:58.290> at<00:01:58.409> all<00:01:58.439> difficult<00:01:58.790> so<00:01:59.790> that's<00:01:59.969> the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
was not at all difficult so that's the

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.310 
was not at all difficult so that's the
type<00:02:00.210> of<00:02:00.240> thing<00:02:00.360> will<00:02:00.570> be<00:02:00.659> able<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.840> add<00:02:01.020> with

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
type of thing will be able to add with

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.420 
type of thing will be able to add with
scripting<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.070> you'll<00:02:02.159> be<00:02:02.250> able<00:02:02.310> to

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
scripting and you'll be able to

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.920 
scripting and you'll be able to
hopefully<00:02:02.579> do<00:02:02.880> stuff<00:02:03.060> like<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.240> yourself<00:02:03.719> as

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
hopefully do stuff like that yourself as

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.810 
hopefully do stuff like that yourself as
well<00:02:04.500> as<00:02:04.619> us<00:02:04.770> provide<00:02:05.070> lots<00:02:05.310> of<00:02:05.490> ones<00:02:05.610> as<00:02:05.790> well

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
well as us provide lots of ones as well

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.639 
well as us provide lots of ones as well
so<00:02:06.600> another<00:02:06.750> cool<00:02:06.990> thing<00:02:07.020> I'll<00:02:07.259> have<00:02:07.380> them<00:02:07.469> sit

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
so another cool thing I'll have them sit

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.559 
so another cool thing I'll have them sit
down<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:08.009> he's<00:02:08.129> out<00:02:08.190> of<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.340> way<00:02:08.399> here<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:08.759> the

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
down so he's out of the way here is the

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.690 
down so he's out of the way here is the
ability<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:10.140> do<00:02:10.770> something<00:02:11.009> called<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.400> case

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
ability to do something called I case

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.699 
ability to do something called I case
which<00:02:12.060> are<00:02:12.239> standard<00:02:12.690> in<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:13.050> lot<00:02:13.200> of<00:02:13.230> games<00:02:13.500> now

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
which are standard in a lot of games now

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:14.330 
which are standard in a lot of games now
but<00:02:13.860> which<00:02:13.950> we<00:02:14.069> don't

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
but which we don't

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.880 
but which we don't
the<00:02:14.489> old<00:02:14.640> client<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.090> that<00:02:15.480> in<00:02:15.769> involves<00:02:16.769> us

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
the old client and that in involves us

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.710 
the old client and that in involves us
being<00:02:16.920> able<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.400> take<00:02:17.580> a<00:02:17.610> character<00:02:18.060> here<00:02:18.330> on

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
being able to take a character here on

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.809 
being able to take a character here on
the<00:02:18.900> screen<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.349> have<00:02:19.769> him<00:02:19.920> dynamically

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
the screen and have him dynamically

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.720 
the screen and have him dynamically
react<00:02:21.300> to<00:02:21.780> certain<00:02:22.650> things<00:02:22.890> in<00:02:23.250> terms<00:02:23.430> of<00:02:23.670> his

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
react to certain things in terms of his

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.460 
react to certain things in terms of his
skeleton<00:02:24.330> so<00:02:24.900> I'm<00:02:24.989> going<00:02:25.050> to<00:02:25.170> do<00:02:25.260> here<00:02:25.440> is

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
skeleton so I'm going to do here is

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.290 
skeleton so I'm going to do here is
going<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:25.769> click<00:02:25.920> this<00:02:26.069> and<00:02:26.340> this<00:02:26.879> guy<00:02:27.060> here

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
going to click this and this guy here

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.910 
going to click this and this guy here
has<00:02:27.420> now<00:02:27.599> snapped<00:02:27.959> to<00:02:28.080> attention<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.800> is

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
has now snapped to attention and is

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.580 
has now snapped to attention and is
looking<00:02:29.010> at<00:02:29.250> me<00:02:29.480> so<00:02:30.480> if<00:02:30.810> i<00:02:30.930> run<00:02:31.080> back<00:02:31.349> and<00:02:31.379> forth

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
looking at me so if i run back and forth

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.699 
looking at me so if i run back and forth
here<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.280> run<00:02:32.670> around<00:02:32.790> him<00:02:33.120> he'll<00:02:33.900> he'll<00:02:34.530> look

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
here and run around him he'll he'll look

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.430 
here and run around him he'll he'll look
so<00:02:34.950> that's<00:02:35.129> based<00:02:35.370> on<00:02:35.610> an<00:02:35.790> ik<00:02:36.209> rig<00:02:37.010> that<00:02:38.010> is

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
so that's based on an ik rig that is

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.350 
so that's based on an ik rig that is
rotating<00:02:40.440> his<00:02:40.530> body<00:02:40.769> to<00:02:40.950> look<00:02:41.069> at<00:02:41.190> me<00:02:41.310> so<00:02:42.000> i'm

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
rotating his body to look at me so i'm

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.670 
rotating his body to look at me so i'm
also<00:02:42.540> going<00:02:42.750> to<00:02:42.840> go<00:02:43.049> just<00:02:43.980> over<00:02:44.280> here<00:02:44.819> and

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
also going to go just over here and

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.479 
also going to go just over here and
change<00:02:46.680> some<00:02:46.920> values<00:02:47.840> that<00:02:48.840> so<00:02:49.739> he<00:02:50.130> should<00:02:50.340> now

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
change some values that so he should now

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:51.949 
change some values that so he should now
also<00:02:50.730> be<00:02:50.940> pointing<00:02:51.209> at<00:02:51.299> me<00:02:51.390> so<00:02:51.540> you<00:02:51.630> can<00:02:51.720> see

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
also be pointing at me so you can see

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.470 
also be pointing at me so you can see
his<00:02:52.799> arm<00:02:53.010> here<00:02:53.220> sticking<00:02:53.549> out<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:54.060> we'll<00:02:54.329> also

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
his arm here sticking out and we'll also

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.940 
his arm here sticking out and we'll also
look<00:02:55.110> right<00:02:55.290> at<00:02:55.440> me<00:02:55.700> and<00:02:57.170> i<00:02:58.170> can<00:02:58.200> set<00:02:58.530> this<00:02:58.650> arm

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
look right at me and i can set this arm

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.160 
look right at me and i can set this arm
to<00:02:59.280> do<00:02:59.430> all<00:02:59.730> sorts<00:03:00.000> of<00:03:00.060> things<00:03:00.120> so<00:03:00.989> what<00:03:01.110> we

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
to do all sorts of things so what we

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.539 
to do all sorts of things so what we
hope<00:03:01.290> to<00:03:01.319> do<00:03:01.500> with<00:03:01.650> that<00:03:01.799> is<00:03:02.069> to<00:03:02.280> allow<00:03:02.489> people

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
hope to do with that is to allow people

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.280 
hope to do with that is to allow people
of<00:03:03.180> different<00:03:03.569> heights<00:03:03.750> different<00:03:03.959> body

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
of different heights different body

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.619 
of different heights different body
shapes<00:03:04.379> stuff<00:03:04.769> like<00:03:04.890> that<00:03:04.920> to<00:03:05.269> interact<00:03:06.269> a<00:03:06.480> lot

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
shapes stuff like that to interact a lot

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:08.330 
shapes stuff like that to interact a lot
more<00:03:06.840> realistically<00:03:07.590> than<00:03:07.829> they<00:03:07.920> do<00:03:07.980> right

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
more realistically than they do right

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.160 
more realistically than they do right
now<00:03:08.879> where<00:03:09.239> everyone<00:03:09.599> if<00:03:09.780> you<00:03:09.870> want<00:03:10.019> to<00:03:10.079> hug

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
now where everyone if you want to hug

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.600 
now where everyone if you want to hug
them<00:03:10.410> when<00:03:10.530> you're<00:03:10.620> all<00:03:10.709> scaled<00:03:11.010> to<00:03:11.129> the<00:03:11.220> exact

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
them when you're all scaled to the exact

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.330 
them when you're all scaled to the exact
same<00:03:11.849> size<00:03:12.500> hopefully<00:03:13.500> we<00:03:13.620> can<00:03:13.799> do<00:03:14.099> something

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
same size hopefully we can do something

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.110 
same size hopefully we can do something
where<00:03:14.840> we<00:03:15.840> say<00:03:16.019> put<00:03:16.410> hands<00:03:16.860> on<00:03:17.040> hips<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:17.760> won't

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
where we say put hands on hips and won't

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.340 
where we say put hands on hips and won't
matter<00:03:18.239> where<00:03:18.660> your<00:03:18.810> hips<00:03:18.959> are<00:03:19.109> if<00:03:19.230> you're

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
matter where your hips are if you're

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.930 
matter where your hips are if you're
tall<00:03:19.530> or<00:03:19.650> short<00:03:19.680> or<00:03:20.010> wherever<00:03:20.220> you<00:03:20.310> are<00:03:20.459> you'll

tall or short or wherever you are you'll

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.569
