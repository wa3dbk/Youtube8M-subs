00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.369
 I'm going to use this glue duo is the 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:13.370

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.440
 little glue here in what is the 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:20.160

 If you see me battling a little bit, it's 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.680
 because I'm not very good at sight and 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.680

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.870
 in the mirror this and I do not see very well and 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.270
 well once it is more retinue what 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.280
 What I'm going to do is raise a little 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.990
 eyelid 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.990
 and I'm going to paste it 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.569
 right in the 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.249
 tabs 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:23.579
 at the birth of the eyelashes and with 

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:23.579
