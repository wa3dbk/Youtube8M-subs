00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.020 
the neck and basically bend it into a
little<00:02:17.680> bit<00:02:17.860> of<00:02:17.950> a<00:02:18.040> backbone<00:02:18.430> just<00:02:18.580> a<00:02:18.790> little

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
little bit of a backbone just a little

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.240 
little bit of a backbone just a little
bit<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:21.430> other<00:02:21.670> thing<00:02:22.500> this<00:02:23.500> neck<00:02:23.740> has<00:02:23.920> a<00:02:23.950> bit

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
bit the other thing this neck has a bit

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.840 
bit the other thing this neck has a bit
of<00:02:24.280> a<00:02:24.730> twist<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:26.130> since<00:02:27.130> I'm<00:02:27.280> using<00:02:27.310> both

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
of a twist and since I'm using both

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.970 
of a twist and since I'm using both
tuners<00:02:28.360> one<00:02:28.600> on<00:02:28.750> each<00:02:28.900> side<00:02:28.930> I'm<00:02:29.440> going<00:02:29.740> to<00:02:29.830> be

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
tuners one on each side I'm going to be

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.920 
tuners one on each side I'm going to be
able<00:02:30.100> to<00:02:30.250> control<00:02:32.490> how<00:02:33.490> much<00:02:33.670> I<00:02:33.850> can<00:02:33.910> take<00:02:34.780> the

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
able to control how much I can take the

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.490 
able to control how much I can take the
twists<00:02:35.230> out<00:02:35.970> so<00:02:36.970> if<00:02:37.090> I<00:02:37.270> let's<00:02:38.080> see<00:02:38.260> if<00:02:38.350> the

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
twists out so if I let's see if the

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.620 
twists out so if I let's see if the
camera<00:02:38.710> will<00:02:39.010> show<00:02:39.220> this<00:02:39.340> if<00:02:39.520> I<00:02:39.640> use<00:02:39.910> my

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
camera will show this if I use my

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.750 
camera will show this if I use my
straightedge<00:02:41.020> as<00:02:41.560> a<00:02:42.390> winding<00:02:43.390> stick<00:02:44.760> that's

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
straightedge as a winding stick that's

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.400 
straightedge as a winding stick that's
what<00:02:45.940> this<00:02:46.030> is<00:02:46.240> called<00:02:46.570> when<00:02:46.840> you<00:02:46.930> use<00:02:47.140> two

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
what this is called when you use two

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.030 
what this is called when you use two
straight<00:02:47.740> edges<00:02:48.100> cross<00:02:48.820> the<00:02:49.090> length<00:02:49.330> all<00:02:49.570> the

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
straight edges cross the length all the

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.600 
straight edges cross the length all the
board<00:02:51.040> and<00:02:51.370> then<00:02:51.490> you<00:02:51.520> sight<00:02:51.880> down<00:02:52.240> them<00:02:52.570> and

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
board and then you sight down them and

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.530 
board and then you sight down them and
look<00:02:54.610> at<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:54.820> difference<00:02:55.150> this<00:02:55.270> is<00:02:55.390> how<00:02:55.480> you

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
look at the difference this is how you

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.160 
look at the difference this is how you
tell<00:02:55.810> what<00:02:56.080> where<00:02:56.530> there's<00:02:56.770> a<00:02:56.860> twist<00:02:57.280> I<00:02:58.170> don't

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
tell what where there's a twist I don't

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.810 
tell what where there's a twist I don't
know<00:02:59.230> if<00:02:59.350> the<00:02:59.440> camera<00:02:59.800> shows<00:03:00.040> this<00:03:00.370> but<00:03:00.640> there

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
know if the camera shows this but there

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.550 
know if the camera shows this but there
is<00:03:00.850> definitely<00:03:01.480> a<00:03:02.100> twist<00:03:03.100> this<00:03:03.760> way<00:03:04.000> and<00:03:04.560> so

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
is definitely a twist this way and so

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.810 
is definitely a twist this way and so
what<00:03:05.770> I<00:03:05.800> want<00:03:06.010> to<00:03:06.070> do<00:03:06.250> is<00:03:06.520> pull<00:03:07.030> down<00:03:07.410> this<00:03:08.410> side

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
what I want to do is pull down this side

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.400 
what I want to do is pull down this side
put<00:03:09.820> a<00:03:09.880> little<00:03:10.030> more<00:03:10.330> pressure<00:03:10.360> on<00:03:11.050> this<00:03:11.350> side

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
put a little more pressure on this side

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.730 
put a little more pressure on this side
so<00:03:12.280> that<00:03:12.310> the<00:03:12.610> twist<00:03:13.080> you<00:03:14.080> know<00:03:14.200> it<00:03:14.320> pulls<00:03:14.620> a

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
so that the twist you know it pulls a

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.100 
so that the twist you know it pulls a
twist<00:03:14.980> this<00:03:15.160> way<00:03:15.340> so<00:03:15.400> that<00:03:15.670> it's<00:03:15.790> straight<00:03:16.150> so

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
twist this way so that it's straight so

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:26.449 
twist this way so that it's straight so
the<00:03:17.290> winding<00:03:17.709> sticks<00:03:17.890> are<00:03:18.130> read<00:03:18.970> even

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.209 

so<00:03:27.450> I'm<00:03:27.810> going<00:03:28.109> to<00:03:28.170> put<00:03:28.349> my<00:03:28.469> straightedge<00:03:28.950> on

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:29.219 
so I'm going to put my straightedge on

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:33.770 
so I'm going to put my straightedge on
here<00:03:29.730> and<00:03:30.709> I<00:03:31.709> can<00:03:31.890> see<00:03:32.250> that<00:03:33.150> I've<00:03:33.299> got<00:03:33.450> a<00:03:33.510> bit

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
here and I can see that I've got a bit

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:52.740 
here and I can see that I've got a bit
of<00:03:33.900> bow<00:03:34.109> and<00:03:34.579> I'm<00:03:35.579> going<00:03:35.819> to<00:03:35.879> tighten

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.170 

right<00:03:53.380> so<00:03:53.530> now<00:03:53.710> the<00:03:53.770> bowl<00:03:54.100> now<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:57.790> neck<00:03:58.030> is

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
right so now the bowl now the neck is

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.480 
right so now the bowl now the neck is
perfectly<00:03:58.570> straight<00:04:02.070> yeah<00:04:03.100> the<00:04:03.310> neck<00:04:03.460> is

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.490 
perfectly straight yeah the neck is

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.240 
perfectly straight yeah the neck is
straight<00:04:03.880> and<00:04:04.570> now<00:04:05.080> we're<00:04:05.230> going<00:04:05.410> to<00:04:05.620> check

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
straight and now we're going to check

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.780 
straight and now we're going to check
for<00:04:06.550> that<00:04:07.510> amount<00:04:07.780> of<00:04:08.290> twists<00:04:08.680> and<00:04:08.950> we'll

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
for that amount of twists and we'll

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.580 
for that amount of twists and we'll
adjust<00:04:10.150> one<00:04:10.510> tuner<00:04:10.870> or<00:04:10.900> the<00:04:11.260> other<00:04:13.590> to

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
adjust one tuner or the other to

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.699 
adjust one tuner or the other to
straighten<00:04:14.980> it<00:04:15.040> I<00:04:15.930> think<00:04:16.930> this<00:04:17.109> one<00:04:17.290> a<00:04:17.500> little

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
straighten it I think this one a little

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:27.060 
straighten it I think this one a little
bit<00:04:17.950> more<00:04:22.290> right<00:04:23.290> there<00:04:24.660> okay<00:04:25.830> so<00:04:26.830> now<00:04:26.980> the

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
bit more right there okay so now the

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.480 
bit more right there okay so now the
thing<00:04:27.370> is<00:04:28.770> straight<00:04:29.770> with<00:04:29.950> the<00:04:30.070> winding

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
thing is straight with the winding

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.960 
thing is straight with the winding
sticks

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
sticks

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.220 
sticks
I<00:04:31.000> mean<00:04:31.270> meaning<00:04:31.660> no<00:04:31.810> twists<00:04:32.170> and<00:04:33.840> it's<00:04:34.840> dead

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
I mean meaning no twists and it's dead

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.440 
I mean meaning no twists and it's dead
straight<00:04:35.890> this<00:04:36.220> way<00:04:36.280> so<00:04:36.460> now<00:04:36.640> I'm<00:04:37.000> just<00:04:37.150> going

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
straight this way so now I'm just going

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:45.830 
straight this way so now I'm just going
to<00:04:37.510> give<00:04:37.780> both<00:04:38.650> tuners<00:04:39.160> a<00:04:41.130> half<00:04:42.130> a<00:04:42.250> turn<00:04:42.460> maybe

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.870

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
okay so now I've got a bit of a back bow

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.170 
okay so now I've got a bit of a back bow
in<00:04:49.210> the<00:04:49.480> neck<00:04:49.690> and<00:04:50.169> I<00:04:51.130> just<00:04:51.550> want<00:04:51.730> to<00:04:51.760> check<00:04:51.970> one

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
in the neck and I just want to check one

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.500 
in the neck and I just want to check one
more<00:04:52.210> time<00:04:52.419> that<00:04:53.020> we<00:04:53.260> are<00:04:53.410> still<00:04:54.330> without<00:04:55.330> a

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
more time that we are still without a

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:00.870 
more time that we are still without a
twist<00:04:56.790> and<00:04:57.790> that<00:04:58.120> looks<00:04:58.330> good<00:04:59.700> alright<00:05:00.700> now

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
twist and that looks good alright now

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.080 
twist and that looks good alright now
I'm<00:05:01.450> going<00:05:01.810> to<00:05:01.960> use<00:05:02.169> this<00:05:02.380> steel<00:05:03.280> straightedge

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
I'm going to use this steel straightedge

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.650 
I'm going to use this steel straightedge
and<00:05:04.419> I'm<00:05:04.510> going<00:05:04.720> to<00:05:04.750> lay<00:05:04.990> it<00:05:05.020> right<00:05:05.169> down<00:05:05.500> on

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
and I'm going to lay it right down on

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.070 
and I'm going to lay it right down on
the<00:05:07.660> next<00:05:07.990> shaft<00:05:09.419> and<00:05:10.419> I'm<00:05:10.600> going<00:05:10.840> to<00:05:10.900> use<00:05:11.050> a

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
the next shaft and I'm going to use a

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.800 
the next shaft and I'm going to use a
clothes<00:05:11.470> iron<00:05:11.770> to<00:05:12.070> apply<00:05:12.370> heat

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.980 

now<00:05:16.810> the<00:05:16.870> reason<00:05:17.140> I'm<00:05:17.229> laying<00:05:17.500> down<00:05:17.650> the<00:05:18.990> this

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
now the reason I'm laying down the this

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.100 
now the reason I'm laying down the this
straightedge<00:05:20.470> is<00:05:20.770> that<00:05:21.479> it<00:05:22.479> will<00:05:22.720> distribute

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
straightedge is that it will distribute

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.550 
straightedge is that it will distribute
the<00:05:23.290> heat<00:05:23.760> from<00:05:24.760> more<00:05:25.060> than<00:05:25.240> just<00:05:25.479> the<00:05:25.630> the<00:05:26.229> the

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
the heat from more than just the the the

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.270 
the heat from more than just the the the
footprint<00:05:27.070> of<00:05:27.130> the<00:05:27.250> clothes<00:05:27.490> iron<00:05:27.760> itself<00:05:29.280> the

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
footprint of the clothes iron itself the

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.730 
footprint of the clothes iron itself the
amount<00:05:30.460> of<00:05:30.550> heat<00:05:30.760> I'm<00:05:31.720> going<00:05:32.320> to<00:05:32.410> set<00:05:32.590> it<00:05:32.710> to

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
amount of heat I'm going to set it to

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.390 
amount of heat I'm going to set it to
kind<00:05:33.370> of<00:05:33.460> a<00:05:33.520> medium<00:05:33.880> low<00:05:34.210> setting<00:05:35.070> let<00:05:36.070> it<00:05:36.190> heat

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
kind of a medium low setting let it heat

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.090 
kind of a medium low setting let it heat
up<00:05:36.430> and<00:05:36.729> then<00:05:37.410> I'm<00:05:38.410> going<00:05:38.590> to<00:05:38.620> measure<00:05:38.860> the

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.100 
up and then I'm going to measure the

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.060 
up and then I'm going to measure the
temperature<00:05:39.130> and<00:05:39.850> I've<00:05:40.840> got<00:05:41.110> an<00:05:41.500> electronic

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
temperature and I've got an electronic

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.350 
temperature and I've got an electronic
multimeter<00:05:43.380> that<00:05:44.380> also<00:05:45.310> has<00:05:45.760> a<00:05:45.790> temperature

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
multimeter that also has a temperature

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.210 
multimeter that also has a temperature
probe<00:05:46.720> so<00:05:47.710> I'm<00:05:47.800> going<00:05:47.919> to<00:05:47.979> use<00:05:48.100> this

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
probe so I'm going to use this

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:54.090 
probe so I'm going to use this
temperature<00:05:48.669> probe<00:05:51.990> just<00:05:52.990> to<00:05:53.110> monitor<00:05:53.350> where

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.100 
temperature probe just to monitor where

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.740 
temperature probe just to monitor where
we're<00:05:54.280> at<00:05:54.400> we<00:05:55.030> don't<00:05:55.180> want<00:05:55.300> it<00:05:55.360> to<00:05:55.419> get<00:05:55.510> too<00:05:55.720> hot

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
we're at we don't want it to get too hot

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.010 
we're at we don't want it to get too hot
so<00:05:56.560> that<00:05:56.590> it<00:05:56.830> you<00:05:57.370> know<00:05:57.460> scorches<00:05:58.180> or<00:05:58.450> burns<00:05:58.810> a

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
so that it you know scorches or burns a

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.500 
so that it you know scorches or burns a
thing<00:05:59.229> but<00:05:59.380> it's<00:05:59.530> got<00:05:59.650> to<00:05:59.740> get<00:05:59.830> hot<00:05:59.979> enough<00:06:00.250> to

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:00.510 
thing but it's got to get hot enough to

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.180 
thing but it's got to get hot enough to
to<00:06:01.510> have<00:06:01.780> some<00:06:01.990> effect<00:06:02.110> on<00:06:02.470> the<00:06:02.680> on<00:06:02.860> the<00:06:03.039> wood

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.190 
to have some effect on the on the wood

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.320 
to have some effect on the on the wood
itself

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.330 
itself

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.580 
itself
so<00:06:05.419> here<00:06:05.599> we<00:06:05.689> are<00:06:05.720> heating<00:06:06.110> up<00:06:06.229> while<00:06:06.470> we're

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:06.590 
so here we are heating up while we're

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:12.790 
so here we are heating up while we're
already<00:06:06.830> up<00:06:07.039> to<00:06:07.840> 40<00:06:10.990> slowing<00:06:11.990> down<00:06:12.139> at<00:06:12.379> 50

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 
already up to 40 slowing down at 50

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:18.909 
already up to 40 slowing down at 50
degrees<00:06:13.840> 51<00:06:14.840> degrees<00:06:16.840> yeah<00:06:17.840> I<00:06:18.139> can<00:06:18.439> feel<00:06:18.620> it

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:18.919 
degrees 51 degrees yeah I can feel it

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:25.480 
degrees 51 degrees yeah I can feel it
it's<00:06:19.039> definitely<00:06:19.430> warming<00:06:20.180> up<00:06:21.879> and<00:06:23.740> I<00:06:24.740> think

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.490 
it's definitely warming up and I think

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.939 
it's definitely warming up and I think
I'm<00:06:25.639> going<00:06:25.759> to<00:06:25.849> target<00:06:26.240> around<00:06:26.409> 45<00:06:27.409> to<00:06:27.650> 50

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:27.949 
I'm going to target around 45 to 50

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:32.800 
I'm going to target around 45 to 50
degrees<00:06:28.340> and<00:06:29.530> leave<00:06:30.530> this<00:06:30.710> on<00:06:30.919> for<00:06:31.689> maybe<00:06:32.689> a

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:32.810 
degrees and leave this on for maybe a

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.760 
degrees and leave this on for maybe a
couple<00:06:33.349> of<00:06:33.469> hours<00:06:33.770> and<00:06:34.840> then<00:06:35.840> after<00:06:36.229> that<00:06:36.349> time

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:36.770 
couple of hours and then after that time

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:42.670 
couple of hours and then after that time
um<00:06:37.129> I<00:06:38.000> will<00:06:38.330> just<00:06:38.569> take<00:06:39.500> the<00:06:39.650> iron<00:06:39.830> off<00:06:40.539> and<00:06:41.680> let

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:42.680 
um I will just take the iron off and let

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.550 
um I will just take the iron off and let
that<00:06:42.860> let<00:06:43.340> the<00:06:43.610> neck<00:06:43.849> cool<00:06:44.389> for<00:06:44.810> a<00:06:44.840> day<00:06:44.900> maybe

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:45.560 
that let the neck cool for a day maybe

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.089 
that let the neck cool for a day maybe
overnight<00:06:46.039> before<00:06:47.030> I<00:06:47.469> release<00:06:48.469> it<00:06:48.500> from<00:06:48.830> this

00:06:49.089 --> 00:06:49.099 
overnight before I release it from this

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:51.270 
overnight before I release it from this
clamping<00:06:49.610> pressure<00:06:49.639> here<00:06:50.120> from<00:06:50.360> the<00:06:50.509> the

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:51.280 
clamping pressure here from the the

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.770 
clamping pressure here from the the
string<00:06:52.280> clamps<00:06:52.729> that<00:06:52.849> I'm<00:06:52.940> using<00:06:53.210> to<00:06:53.629> make<00:06:53.719> a

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:53.780 
string clamps that I'm using to make a

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.839 
string clamps that I'm using to make a
back<00:06:54.050> bow<00:06:54.289> and<00:06:54.530> hopefully<00:06:55.129> that<00:06:55.310> will<00:06:55.550> take

00:06:55.839 --> 00:06:55.849 
back bow and hopefully that will take

00:06:55.849 --> 00:06:58.740 
back bow and hopefully that will take
care<00:06:56.030> of<00:06:56.180> the<00:06:56.330> the<00:06:56.360> neck<00:06:57.139> twist<00:06:57.889> and<00:06:58.159> Bo

00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:58.750 
care of the the neck twist and Bo

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:02.399 
care of the the neck twist and Bo
alright<00:06:59.750> so<00:06:59.900> here<00:07:00.080> we<00:07:00.110> are<00:07:00.279> next<00:07:01.279> morning<00:07:01.759> and

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:02.409 
alright so here we are next morning and

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:05.679 
alright so here we are next morning and
this<00:07:03.409> has<00:07:03.590> been<00:07:03.740> cooling<00:07:04.009> overnight<00:07:04.909> and

00:07:05.679 --> 00:07:05.689 
this has been cooling overnight and

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:16.529 
this has been cooling overnight and
let's<00:07:06.409> take<00:07:06.590> a<00:07:06.620> look<00:07:06.860> oh<00:07:11.529> it<00:07:12.529> looks<00:07:13.659> perfect

00:07:16.529 --> 00:07:16.539 
let's take a look oh it looks perfect

00:07:16.539 --> 00:07:21.399 
let's take a look oh it looks perfect
it's<00:07:17.539> perfectly<00:07:18.319> straight<00:07:19.180> and<00:07:20.180> as<00:07:21.080> far<00:07:21.349> as

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:21.409 
it's perfectly straight and as far as

00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:32.860 
it's perfectly straight and as far as
twists<00:07:21.830> goes<00:07:27.610> yeah<00:07:28.610> that's<00:07:29.509> great<00:07:31.690> so<00:07:32.690> as<00:07:32.779> you

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:32.870 
twists goes yeah that's great so as you

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.159 
twists goes yeah that's great so as you
can<00:07:32.960> see<00:07:33.020> that<00:07:33.500> is<00:07:33.740> one<00:07:34.069> method<00:07:34.339> of

00:07:35.159 --> 00:07:35.169 
can see that is one method of

00:07:35.169 --> 00:07:41.110 
can see that is one method of
straightening<00:07:36.169> a<00:07:36.379> warped<00:07:36.740> neck<00:07:38.020> see<00:07:39.020> ya
