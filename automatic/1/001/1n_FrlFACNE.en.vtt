00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.790
 Saturday of those movies that you entered 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:12.000
 says Carlos if he had a family type 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.830
 woman children and such I think all 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.279
 World was going to leave the movie very happy. 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.460
 because this movie basically is for 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:24.199
 from the adult family to the child and 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.269
 simply pleases everyone and 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:29.640
 difficult today a film of 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.910
 animation does this then mainly 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:37.760
 the one that already a little more pulled by the 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.760
 legal parade adult 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:52.670
 so how to train your dragon 2 that the 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:59.000
 how to train your movie 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:01:02.210
 dragon high wins dragan dragan so 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.800
 now 2 basic the mind simply the 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.610
 thing is, as is a 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.950
 sequence 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.350
 many things happened understood and 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:14.030
 Here he brings a halt a bit 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:17.290
 more adult than this taboo business 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.300
 of the character because he kind of grows 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:23.570
 in the middle know no complete idiot 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.850
 mentally retarded but as the first 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.220
 This movie surprised a lot from here. 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.700
 it takes all those elements of the 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.860
 first film and sent one knows for a 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.740
 a little bigger place 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.200
 he climbs the steps wine understands him 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.740
 takes a little more risk it brings a 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.030
 thematic I know there sums up that neither 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.360
 I did not take actually spoke to 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.090
 Synopsis I'll talk now 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.069
 synopsis more or less like this happened 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.490
 things in the first movie for everyone 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:57.860
 now type like dragon and everything else is 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.530
 now there's a guy who kind of wants to 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:04.789
 create an army of dragon and power all 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.530
 world then because it is basically the 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:09.740
 decide but only that I do not want to give 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.380
 answer to anyone and there are more 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.690
 deeper than this I can say that 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.630
 this film it as I said 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.790
 daum under the grass understood compared 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.330
 the first film because it brings a 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.670
 thematic a little darker understand 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:31.520
 more dark leaving something a little 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:33.380
 but he does not sacrifice the side 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.319
 that he is a film also for the 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:39.680
 child understands it's all here if means 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:44.390
 that the balance between business is a 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.430
 main character ricca and the flash 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.810
 I just just got your name in English 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:55.480
 I do not know if they're ever dubbed 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:58.819
 watched voiced so I got time 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.349
 I saw that the two now 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.870
 logical that it is not so little else are 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:05.989
 together and double thalma and everything else and 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.659
 progress with the story the villain 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:11.109
 it is the beginning it may seem like no 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:13.159
 What the hell, you fucking villain! 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:16.459
 but as the story goes 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:19.400
 progressing you know will meet a 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:23.319
 little more villainous and has given a little 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:26.659
 more reason why he is evil in a 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.819
 deal badly and eventually know that 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:32.299
 daily so animation films 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:36.139
 had this one got a popular is well 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:38.930
 built the characters have your know 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:41.709
 its time for you to develop and 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:45.260
 The way it's supposed to be, because it's here. 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:47.859
 a continuation of the first film then 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.030
 You have to give a little more to know. 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:51.500
 then you have to develop a 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.919
 little more than like part of 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:57.500
 girlfriend show part of guy type 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:04:00.019
 Car father that his father's face not 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.259
 dude what kind have to be the leader now 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:05.720
 stop the boss and have all that deal 

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:08.349
 and then there's a lot going on in the 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:12.379
 movie understands but anyway it does not 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:14.720
 half busted business is balanced 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:17.329
 way that makes sense and a movie remained 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.470
 very cool, very cool guy 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:25.310
 For me, this movie simply can be 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:26.389
 the best animation of the year so far is the 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.020
 best 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:33.919
 You can say the phrase and such the phrase 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:36.949
 It was nice, but if there's a face, get paper. 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:40.070
 understood there is an end of the lego, right? 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:42.469
 paulo was not better or worse 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:45.500
 I think all three are my pairs. 

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:47.210
 opinion then, because it 's personal is this 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.719
 I hope you liked it and I 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:53.030
 I went straight in the comments what you 

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:55.520
 liked the movie itself you watched it 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.500
 there comparing with the first kind 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.490
 changed the development of such 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.710
 character got a little better 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.789
 understood how the character xe 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.219
 everything else 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:06.560
 The comparison is with the tv series that 

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:10.279
 kind of thing on Friday the TV series 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.590
 because I do not really know 

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:18.410
 so it's 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:21.260
 and as I have always been water and I have done 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.370
 straight because I have to do certain 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.850
 things 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.530
 so I do not have much time so by 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:30.080
 This, I know, I'm just going to give me a 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:39.200
 Fuck something here to let you know me. 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:41.000
 It 's more or less the movie, that 's it now. 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:45.280
 Now I do not know how I end this. 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.280
 we went
