 teach playing parchís on a page 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.400
 I recommend them a lot because we 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.490

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.530

 chinchón broom trivia cinquillo y 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.840
 many games more good link let's start 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.970
 first we enter the page once 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.640
 we are already there we put our user and 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.010
 password I'll put my user once 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.840
 that we are already in our profile we can 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.820
 choose any game but I'm going to 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.830
 choose patches since it is one of my 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.899
 favorite games we click and 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.020
 we hope that I will load the room 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.180
 be able to play we wait a moment and a 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.129
 Once we are in the room there are several 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.350
 games we click on parchís and then 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.120
 we click on play we will leave a 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.980
 window in which we can choose the 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.190
 type of game that can be 2 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.379
 players of 3 or 4 good I'm going to 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.899
 leave like this and I'll only put fingers then 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.000
 we can control the play time yo 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.940
 I usually put in 5 seconds so what 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.859
 I'll leave in 5 we can also choose to play 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.110
 with clubs that are virtual currencies 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.600
 of owl in this case I will play without clubs 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:11.119
 we can choose if we want the game 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.119
 and good finally we click on ok 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.090
 now we wait a while until 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.160
 someone enters the game to be able 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.380
 play ready a user has entered now 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.120
 we can start the game let's see who 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.220
 it's the user that is going to play with me 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.410
 as we can see is the user face 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.360
 corpse she is from spain 'madrid good 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.340
 she is yellow and i color 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.050
 red the goal of the game is to poke 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.240
 all our four chips to the 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.860
 triangle of our color in my case I 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.650
 I have to get here from this 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.600
 way the one who arrives first wins 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.570
 there are some points that should remain in 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.940
 clear before starting to play first 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.830
 Who is the one who starts playing 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.870
 understand the one that gets the highest number 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.750
 with the die then the turns are gone 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.970
 alternating the one that takes out the number 6 wins 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.370
 one more turn so he pulls again but 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.480
 You can only get a maximum of 2 times the 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.700
 number 6 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.750
 because if you take 3 times 6 the card is 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.750
 return to your home 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:10.310
 this game can be played from 2 of 3 or of 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:12.530
 4 players here as you can see touched me 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.990
 the number 6 so I pull back and I 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.510
 touched another 6 so when I throw if I 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.070
 comes out 6 again my file is returned as well 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.760
 I'm going to cross my fingers 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:27.650
 [Laughs] 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.870
 Well, thank goodness I got a 3 so 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:35.390
 we're still good if you hit the number 1 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:37.930
 come eat me so go forward 20 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.930
 squares 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.870
 with the number 5 we can take our 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.170
 house chips so we should try 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.010
 to get the 5 good I got the 5 so 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.010
 I will take out my file 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.530
 when we already have a chip outside and 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.420
 another one comes to that we call it the bridge 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.189
 bridge does not allow the others to pass 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.200
 players so that suits us 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:02.870
 we can open the bridge when we want 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.920
 or when we get the number 6 there if 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.040
 we are obliged to open the bridge 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.110
 [Music] 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.760
 another thing that they should know is that there 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.620
 safe places where we the 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.200
 can eat those places are those that 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.569
 are marked are darker squares 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.050
 I will mark them so they can see them 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.210
 all right 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.750
 as you can see those are the places 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.750
 insurance 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.460
 finally we can advance 10 squares 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.070
 when we put a file to our 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.110
 good triangle those are all the 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.120
 rules that are in the game as they can 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.150
 see is a very fun game to me 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:44.549
 like it a lot so to have fun win 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:47.670
 the game good I say goodbye kisses 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.670
