00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.940
 You will see more news from CS 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.700

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.870
 for example an amazon pack or 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.670
 very large 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.830
 Did you guess that you have 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:23.160
 this package so that delivery is 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:26.220
 connected that was to stay updated acs 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.830
 There are still a lot of cool news and

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.860
 there in las vegas to lg presented the 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.570
 reflections here has curved screen and the team 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.700
 the technician of what is there in las vegas 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.829
 check the device our 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.930
 correspondents there agree that the 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.390
 format of the device causes it to 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.239
 perfectly match the face 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.090
 so the phone is closer to the mouth and 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.430
 the connections are better to handle the 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.239
 is not difficult because of this 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.809
 curve 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.940
 the reflexes have a processor of 2.26 ghz 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.829
 and 2 gb of ram 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.930
 this device is now available in the

 South Korea but has no 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.090
 to reach brazil laser presented a 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.450
 nice interesting modular pc design 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.520
 called christine this concept aims to 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.310
 facilitate the exchange of parts of a 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.650
 thanks to the modular design 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.409
 it means if you want to change boards 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.460
 only plug the gp11 module into the 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.860
 cabinet 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.930
 the project consists of pci architecture 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.520
 express that synchronizes everything 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.759
 automatically 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.630
 this module has liquid cooling 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.299
 noise insulation 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.610
 Did you like this idea? 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.630
 avenge and perhaps become a reality in 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.119
 a near future 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.270
 intel also showed a bet 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:49.170
 This is Edson. 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.170
 computer with the size of a sd card 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.560
 This computer has quark s 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.060
 o co2 linux and was built with modules 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.130
 wifi and bluetooth 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.750
 according to intel it is geared towards 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.280
 developers 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.530
 the company even organized a 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.290
 competition to encourage 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.229
 developers 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:11.020
 working with edson and this news

 this year and we have yet another highlight 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.960
 from acs 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.490
 in this issue of today's tek world is the 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.350

 four openings for air inlet 5 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.730
 thermal ducts cool all 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.340
 also highlight the possibility of 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.190
 connect up to three additional monitors and 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:51.130
 buttons dedicated to this notebook macros 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:54.370
 should be launched in March with prices that

 This coin is encrypted currency. 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.570
 so valued that the guys there the super 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.739
 machines to achieve more and more 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.380
 of these coins 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.720
 there is even a company called requires 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.000
 that mayer that comes from equipment of 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.860
 mining of bitcoins ie 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.510
 machines to get together and put together 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.360

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.209
 in addition this company has a floor 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.640
 whole with a kind of data center 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:36.010
 mining companies that only collect the 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.260
 Coins ie this investment should

 Bitcoins is a fad time 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.790
 for example you would invest this 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:52.120
 a Polish company released a video

 given 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.519
 they were created in 3d based on 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.140
 real environments scanned with the 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.780
