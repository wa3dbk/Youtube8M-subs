00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.300 
that's it and you don't have to get in
the<00:01:33.840> car<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.170> go<00:01:34.229> down<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.590> street<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.159> other

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
the car and go down the street the other

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.499 
the car and go down the street the other
thing<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.579> think<00:01:35.759> we<00:01:35.880> have<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.030> mention<00:01:36.299> is<00:01:36.479> the

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
thing I think we have to mention is the

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.359 
thing I think we have to mention is the
windows<00:01:36.990> because<00:01:37.259> typically<00:01:37.710> we<00:01:37.920> don't<00:01:37.950> think

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
windows because typically we don't think

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.160 
windows because typically we don't think
of<00:01:38.579> basements<00:01:39.030> having<00:01:39.270> windows<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.990> have<00:01:40.020> a

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
of basements having windows you have a

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.780 
of basements having windows you have a
window<00:01:40.500> here<00:01:40.799> in<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:40.979> great<00:01:41.189> room<00:01:41.220> kitchen

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
window here in the great room kitchen

area<00:01:42.030> as<00:01:42.180> well<00:01:42.630> as<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.960> two<00:01:43.140> bedrooms<00:01:43.619> uh-huh

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
area as well as the two bedrooms uh-huh

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.069 
area as well as the two bedrooms uh-huh
when<00:01:44.430> we<00:01:44.579> come<00:01:44.700> in<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.909> design<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.420> room<00:01:45.600> and

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
when we come in to design the room and

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.359 
when we come in to design the room and
design<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.530> whole<00:01:46.680> environment<00:01:46.950> is<00:01:47.250> we're

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.370 
design the whole environment is we're
going<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.520> look<00:01:47.729> at<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.000> window<00:01:48.329> area<00:01:48.899> and

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
going to look at the window area and
