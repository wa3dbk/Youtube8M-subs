now<00:01:43.580> they<00:01:43.790> retreat<00:01:44.240> way<00:01:44.510> off<00:01:44.750> into<00:01:45.140> the

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
now they retreat way off into the

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.710 
now they retreat way off into the
distant<00:01:45.650> pack<00:01:45.830> ice<00:01:46.100> where<00:01:46.729> we<00:01:46.909> think<00:01:47.180> they're

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
distant pack ice where we think they're

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.080 
distant pack ice where we think they're
relatively<00:01:48.680> food<00:01:48.890> deprived<00:01:49.340> we<00:01:49.729> know<00:01:49.909> that

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
relatively food deprived we know that

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.450 
relatively food deprived we know that
the<00:01:50.210> ocean<00:01:50.750> way<00:01:50.930> offshore<00:01:51.140> is<00:01:51.680> very

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
the ocean way offshore is very

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.789 
the ocean way offshore is very
unproductive<00:01:53.060> we<00:01:53.780> think<00:01:54.080> that<00:01:54.229> their<00:01:54.380> access

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
unproductive we think that their access

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.340 
unproductive we think that their access
to<00:01:54.830> seals<00:01:55.220> is<00:01:55.549> relatively<00:01:56.180> low<00:01:56.390> seals<00:01:57.080> are<00:01:57.320> the

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
to seals is relatively low seals are the

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.920 
to seals is relatively low seals are the
principal<00:01:57.950> source<00:01:58.220> of<00:01:58.370> food<00:01:58.610> and<00:01:58.940> so<00:01:59.540> we<00:01:59.750> think

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
principal source of food and so we think

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.780 
principal source of food and so we think
that<00:02:00.049> that<00:02:00.200> explains<00:02:00.920> part<00:02:01.369> of<00:02:01.490> what<00:02:01.640> we're

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
that that explains part of what we're

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.880 
that that explains part of what we're
seeing<00:02:02.030> in<00:02:02.330> the<00:02:02.510> changes<00:02:02.990> in<00:02:03.110> the<00:02:03.200> population

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
seeing in the changes in the population

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.280 
seeing in the changes in the population
structure<00:02:04.360> sizes<00:02:05.360> of<00:02:05.479> animals<00:02:05.900> and<00:02:06.049> things

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
structure sizes of animals and things

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.960 
structure sizes of animals and things
like<00:02:06.470> that<00:02:06.530> another<00:02:07.430> thing<00:02:07.729> that<00:02:07.880> we're

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
like that another thing that we're

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.520 
like that another thing that we're
seeing<00:02:08.000> is<00:02:08.330> more<00:02:08.659> and<00:02:08.780> more<00:02:08.959> bears<00:02:09.229> getting

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
seeing is more and more bears getting

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.739 
seeing is more and more bears getting
stuck<00:02:09.890> on<00:02:10.069> land<00:02:10.369> in<00:02:10.610> northern<00:02:11.000> Alaska<00:02:11.120> and

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:11.749 
stuck on land in northern Alaska and

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:14.140 
stuck on land in northern Alaska and
when<00:02:12.409> they're<00:02:12.529> on<00:02:12.680> land<00:02:12.950> unless<00:02:13.400> they<00:02:13.760> happen

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
when they're on land unless they happen

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.070 
when they're on land unless they happen
upon<00:02:14.269> the<00:02:14.689> remain

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
upon the remain

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.200 
upon the remain
of<00:02:15.380> a<00:02:15.530> beach<00:02:15.890> Marine<00:02:16.310> Mammal<00:02:16.520> or<00:02:16.850> something

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
of a beach Marine Mammal or something

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.270 
of a beach Marine Mammal or something
like<00:02:17.360> that<00:02:17.780> there<00:02:18.080> are<00:02:18.170> also<00:02:18.320> food<00:02:18.800> deprived

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
like that there are also food deprived

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.860 
like that there are also food deprived
and<00:02:19.700> so<00:02:19.850> we've<00:02:20.030> got<00:02:20.180> animals<00:02:20.690> that

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
and so we've got animals that

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.410 
and so we've got animals that
historically<00:02:21.530> had<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.310> opportunity<00:02:22.970> to<00:02:23.120> feed

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
historically had the opportunity to feed

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.350 
historically had the opportunity to feed
throughout<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:24.080> summer<00:02:24.350> are<00:02:24.980> now<00:02:25.360> food

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
throughout the summer are now food

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.270 
throughout the summer are now food
deprived<00:02:26.840> for<00:02:27.350> much<00:02:27.500> of<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.770> summer<00:02:27.950> and

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
deprived for much of the summer and

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.390 
deprived for much of the summer and
we've<00:02:29.270> got<00:02:29.480> studies<00:02:29.930> undergoing<00:02:30.500> to<00:02:30.980> try<00:02:31.220> and

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
we've got studies undergoing to try and

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.120 
we've got studies undergoing to try and
figure<00:02:31.610> out<00:02:31.960> how<00:02:32.960> this<00:02:33.290> is<00:02:33.470> affecting<00:02:33.620> them

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
figure out how this is affecting them

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.240 
figure out how this is affecting them
but<00:02:34.600> broadly<00:02:35.600> it<00:02:35.870> looks<00:02:36.230> like<00:02:36.470> it's<00:02:36.740> affecting

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
but broadly it looks like it's affecting

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.210 
but broadly it looks like it's affecting
them<00:02:37.400> in<00:02:37.580> terms<00:02:37.790> of<00:02:38.000> body<00:02:38.210> stature<00:02:38.600> and

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
them in terms of body stature and

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:48.150 
them in terms of body stature and
survival

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.220
