00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.929
 Sony's newest option in Brazil 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:17.170
 aimed at those looking for a model 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:19.180
 smartphone basics and the xperia 3 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.690
 the device is compatible with two sim 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:25.480
 cards and has 4-inch screen and a half 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.640
 even if the hardware is simpler to 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.650
 the price range in which it fits 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.390
 can be a problem with respect to 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.339
 sales in the country 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.460
 our impressions about this 

00:00:33.339 --> 00:00:38.350
 product is what you now 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.170
 video analysis 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.120
 or former PM 3 maintains the design that 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.300
 dominates practically the whole line of 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.429
 Sony phones with a good footprint 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.739
 model is finished in plastic but 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:54.129
 resistance is shown to those who hold 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.350
 he footprint is firm and the physical buttons 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.399
 does not become a nuisance during 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.679
 handling 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:03.630
 in this respect we can say that the 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:06.910
 handsome and also comfortable 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:09.790
 even for the model input to the screen 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.430
 tpa and 3 leaves a little to be desired 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.680
 The first point that draws attention is the 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.640
 absence of an oleophobic layer in the 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.700
 display 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.130
 this makes it less smooth in marks 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.740
 remain on the screen with more 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.990
 facility 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.330
 under sunlight the index of reflection is 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.280
 higher than desired but still 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.510
 does not compromise the result 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.300
 Last 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:38.980
 the low resolution is compensated by the good 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:41.370
 Brightness level setting to only 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:44.260
 4 GB of storage space 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.150
 percentage that today is even little 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.060
 to the input device 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.960
 fortunately there is support for micro card 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.290
 sd 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.780
 in terms of performance the spa and 3 can 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.180
 It is considered functional since 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.830
 basic social networking apps and emails 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.710
 work very well 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.600
 already when the subject are the games the thing 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.270
 change a little figure 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.039
 games that take up more space or 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.950
 require a lot of 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.200
 processing like real racing 3 does not 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.780
 they run 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.390
 Pepsi as simple as time year can 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.280
 be executed with ease 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.239
 keep in mind that this is a template 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.099
 basic 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.890
 if you want something else on a device 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.569
 it might be best to look for models 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.930
 category above 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.910
 the main camera of the spea and three breaks 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.239
 a bough for photos in environments well 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:39.480
 illuminated but even in them we perceive the 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.819
 high index of granulation are the photos 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.900
 in nocturnal environments suffer from the same 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.910
 problem 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.400
 but different from what happens in many 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.650
 incoming smartphones in this case the 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.650
 result is not as disappointing as this. 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.900
 thanks to the good configuration options of 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.780
 sony device camera 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.000
 the battery life is perhaps the point 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.829
 more satisfying than we realize in 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.410
 tibia and three of uol 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:06.870
 in our tests just over five 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.510
 hours of intensive use were enough 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.660
 to fully train the battery with 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.480
 the moderate use of social networks and 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.910
 mails and sites throughout the day the battery 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.500
 arrived at the end of the night with about 20 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.989
 percent load 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.440
 if you want to require a little more 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:30.090
 with heavier games or apps is 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:32.160
 good to have the charger always close by 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.040
 good audio quality is a brand 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.950
 of smartphones from Sony and the 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.980
 tibia and three do or this is no different 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.720
 sound is high and the level of distortion 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.819
 noises is small 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.470
 the appliance is also accompanied by 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.470
 simple headphones 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.760
 the high launch price of xperia and 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.560
 three of the gni be active to do 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.150
 it a rather interesting option 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.730
 for the consumer 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.790
 for the same amount you can buy one 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.130
 new g or blue mode in 15 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.440
 both intermediate category models 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.430
 and with hardware superior to the 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.910
 sony 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:16.850
 the medium quality screen and a space 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:19.160
 storage capacity can be reduced 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.590
 do not bother who is looking for 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.110
 simpler smartphone but let's 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.630
 Honest is not worth spending so much 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.310
 thus on an apparatus with such 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.040
 features 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.860
 if you find the product in some way 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.050
 promotion and want to take him home 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.990
 know that within his proposal 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.930
 you will hardly be disappointed 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:45.290
 the performance is reasonable and the unit gives 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.630
 account of most essential tasks 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:50.690
 despite being an attractive model in 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.700
 some things unfortunately he is 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.070
 far from being one of the most 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:58.280
 from Sony to the consumer 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:00.560
 also check our analysis 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.190
