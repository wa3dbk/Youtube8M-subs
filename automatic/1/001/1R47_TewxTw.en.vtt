now Wow take a look at all the
contamination<00:04:01.069> that<00:04:01.160> we<00:04:01.250> just<00:04:01.400> pulled<00:04:01.579> off

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
contamination that we just pulled off

clay bar is contaminated pretty evenly

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.119 
clay bar is contaminated pretty evenly
like<00:04:06.500> this<00:04:06.680> fold<00:04:07.640> it<00:04:07.790> in<00:04:07.879> half

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:09.129 
like this fold it in half

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:13.059 
like this fold it in half
stretch<00:04:10.129> it<00:04:10.280> open<00:04:11.109> fold<00:04:12.109> in<00:04:12.230> half<00:04:12.349> again<00:04:12.470> and

stretch it open fold in half again and

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:14.440 
stretch it open fold in half again and
what<00:04:13.310> I'm<00:04:13.400> doing<00:04:13.430> is<00:04:13.849> working<00:04:14.239> all<00:04:14.359> the
