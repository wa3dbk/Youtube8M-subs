00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
talk about go back for a while because I

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.640 
talk about go back for a while because I
mean<00:00:26.789> really<00:00:26.820> how<00:00:27.539> can<00:00:27.750> you<00:00:27.869> pass<00:00:28.199> up<00:00:28.529> the

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
mean really how can you pass up the

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.320 
mean really how can you pass up the
opportunity<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:29.130> use<00:00:29.279> Gus<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.640> go<00:00:29.760> back<00:00:29.970> that's

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
opportunity to use Gus to go back that's

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.880 
opportunity to use Gus to go back that's
that's<00:00:30.660> kind<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.289> main<00:00:31.410> reason<00:00:31.769> why<00:00:31.859> I

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
that's kind of the main reason why I

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:32.389 
that's kind of the main reason why I
have<00:00:32.070> it

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
have it

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.290 
have it
so<00:00:32.820> anyway<00:00:33.570> looking<00:00:33.960> at<00:00:34.140> go<00:00:34.590> bad<00:00:34.860> yeah<00:00:35.550> it's

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
so anyway looking at go bad yeah it's

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.610 
so anyway looking at go bad yeah it's
interesting<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.899> think<00:00:36.930> about<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:37.590> I

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
interesting to think about that so I

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.680 
interesting to think about that so I
also<00:00:37.860> did<00:00:38.219> was<00:00:38.250> thinking<00:00:38.879> about<00:00:39.120> breaking<00:00:39.390> it

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
also did was thinking about breaking it

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.780 
also did was thinking about breaking it
down<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.899> where<00:00:40.230> I'll<00:00:40.590> do<00:00:40.860> crobat<00:00:41.250> later<00:00:41.460> today

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
down to where I'll do crobat later today

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.280 
down to where I'll do crobat later today
might<00:00:42.450> as<00:00:42.540> well<00:00:42.629> just<00:00:42.809> do<00:00:42.899> both<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.140> those

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
might as well just do both of those

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.470 
might as well just do both of those
Pokemon<00:00:43.770> but<00:00:43.980> this<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.820> first<00:00:44.969> Pokemon

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
Pokemon but this is the first Pokemon

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.450 
Pokemon but this is the first Pokemon
that<00:00:45.629> got<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.079> evolution<00:00:46.649> in<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:47.039> future

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
that got and evolution in a future

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.310 
that got and evolution in a future
generation<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.420> might<00:00:48.600> as<00:00:48.660> well<00:00:48.750> try<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.079> do

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
generation so I might as well try to do

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.740 
generation so I might as well try to do
the<00:00:49.469> pre<00:00:49.800> evolution<00:00:50.309> if<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:50.940> applicable<00:00:51.449> or

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
the pre evolution if it is applicable or

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.959 
the pre evolution if it is applicable or
if<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.289> can<00:00:52.469> just<00:00:52.649> go<00:00:52.829> into<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.670> next

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
if I can just go into the next

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.209 
if I can just go into the next
generation<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.690> just<00:00:54.899> try<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.170> get<00:00:55.440> like<00:00:55.620> the

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
generation and just try to get like the

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.310 
generation and just try to get like the
strategy<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.090> guys<00:00:57.270> as<00:00:57.570> soon<00:00:57.750> as<00:00:57.899> possible

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
strategy to you guys as soon as possible

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.420 
strategy to you guys as soon as possible
so<00:00:58.410> it's<00:00:58.530> kind<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.680> like<00:00:58.770> skipping<00:00:59.340> ahead

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
so it's kind of like skipping ahead

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.029 
so it's kind of like skipping ahead
while<00:01:00.120> staying<00:01:00.480> with<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.020> evolutionary<00:01:01.800> line

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
while staying with the evolutionary line

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.240 
while staying with the evolutionary line
anyway<00:01:02.969> go<00:01:03.960> back<00:01:04.170> since<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.739> not<00:01:05.129> fully

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
anyway go back since it is a not fully

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.039 
anyway go back since it is a not fully
evolved<00:01:05.580> Pokemon<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.210> can<00:01:06.390> slap<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.720> nevio

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
evolved Pokemon you can slap a nevio

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.750 
evolved Pokemon you can slap a nevio
light<00:01:07.350> on<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.740> actually<00:01:08.130> get<00:01:08.369> some<00:01:08.580> decent

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
light on it and actually get some decent

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
results because golbat has okay hit

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.030 
results because golbat has okay hit
points<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:12.170> solid<00:01:13.170> enough<00:01:13.320> defenses<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.920> make

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
points and solid enough defenses to make

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.980 
points and solid enough defenses to make
fel<00:01:14.369> light<00:01:14.520> work<00:01:14.729> however<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.780> does<00:01:15.960> not

able<00:03:07.889> like<00:03:07.980> give<00:03:08.159> you<00:03:08.250> a<00:03:08.280> good<00:03:08.459> amount<00:03:08.549> and<00:03:09.000> by

able like give you a good amount and by
sacrificing<00:03:10.049> the<00:03:10.170> hit<00:03:10.319> points<00:03:10.650> and<00:03:10.739> putting

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
sacrificing the hit points and putting

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.099 
sacrificing the hit points and putting
into<00:03:11.129> defense<00:03:11.519> since<00:03:12.090> Ivo<00:03:12.389> Lite<00:03:12.569> is<00:03:12.720> boosting

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
into defense since Ivo Lite is boosting

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.199 
into defense since Ivo Lite is boosting
at<00:03:13.199> one-and-a-half<00:03:13.739> times<00:03:13.949> those<00:03:14.639> EVs<00:03:15.090> are

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
at one-and-a-half times those EVs are

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.240 
at one-and-a-half times those EVs are
going<00:03:15.419> to<00:03:15.510> go<00:03:15.629> a<00:03:15.660> little<00:03:15.959> further<00:03:16.290> in<00:03:16.650> defenses

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
going to go a little further in defenses

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.860 
going to go a little further in defenses
than<00:03:17.400> in<00:03:17.549> the<00:03:17.609> hit<00:03:17.760> points<00:03:18.060> so<00:03:18.209> you<00:03:18.510> can<00:03:18.720> cut

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
than in the hit points so you can cut

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.930 
than in the hit points so you can cut
off<00:03:18.959> some<00:03:19.199> hit<00:03:19.799> points<00:03:20.129> you<00:03:20.280> still<00:03:20.579> need<00:03:20.730> some

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
off some hit points you still need some

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.729 
off some hit points you still need some
good<00:03:21.120> hit<00:03:21.299> point<00:03:21.510> bulk<00:03:21.720> and<00:03:21.900> then<00:03:22.440> you<00:03:22.560> can

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
good hit point bulk and then you can

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.159 
good hit point bulk and then you can
balance<00:03:22.949> it<00:03:23.160> out<00:03:23.310> and<00:03:23.579> still<00:03:24.060> be<00:03:24.419> relatively

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.169
