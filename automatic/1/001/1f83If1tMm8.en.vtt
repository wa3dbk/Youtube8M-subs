00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
where it's coming from that is the

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.310 
where it's coming from that is the
teaching<00:00:16.320> that<00:00:17.279> causes<00:00:18.210> this<00:00:18.480> question<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.170> be

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320

asked of course you ask for forgiveness
for<00:00:23.939> your<00:00:24.000> sins<00:00:24.650> if<00:00:25.650> we<00:00:26.010> confess<00:00:26.550> our<00:00:26.820> sins<00:00:27.240> and

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
that is to say the same thing God says

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
about your sin God says it's sin he also

about your sin God says it's sin he also
tells<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.170> church<00:00:46.500> seven<00:00:47.070> times<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:48.120> seven

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
tells the church seven times to seven

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.430 
tells the church seven times to seven
churches<00:00:48.809> in<00:00:49.260> revelation<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.460> repent<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.440> may

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
churches in revelation to repent and may

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.010 
churches in revelation to repent and may
I<00:00:52.469> say<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.430> my<00:00:53.940> feeling<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.600> you

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
I say to you that my feeling is you

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.130 
I say to you that my feeling is you
should<00:00:55.289> repent<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.940> think<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.780> the

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
should repent and I think that the

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.560 
should repent and I think that the
scripture<00:00:58.649> makes<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:59.100> very<00:00:59.129> clear<00:00:59.520> and<00:01:00.090> you

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
scripture makes that very clear and you

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.039 
scripture makes that very clear and you
cannot<00:01:01.109> edge<00:01:01.379> away<00:01:01.949> from<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.550> by<00:01:02.850> taking<00:01:03.780> the

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
cannot edge away from it by taking the

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.070 
cannot edge away from it by taking the
word<00:01:04.290> first<00:01:04.920> John<00:01:05.280> 19<00:01:05.880> which<00:01:06.540> says<00:01:06.780> if<00:01:07.049> we

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
word first John 19 which says if we

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.450 
word first John 19 which says if we
confess<00:01:07.320> our<00:01:08.250> sins<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.540> word<00:01:09.780> confess<00:01:10.530> needs

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
confess our sins that word confess needs

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.750 
confess our sins that word confess needs
to<00:01:11.670> say<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.420> same<00:01:12.689> thing<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.189> stand

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
to say the same thing that is you stand

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.210 
to say the same thing that is you stand
off<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.270> look<00:01:15.420> at<00:01:15.570> yourself<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.590> what<00:01:16.950> you've

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
off and look at yourself and what you've

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.399 
off and look at yourself and what you've
done<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.759> say<00:01:18.030> exactly<00:01:18.450> what<00:01:18.840> God<00:01:19.049> says

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
done and you say exactly what God says

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.580 
done and you say exactly what God says
about<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.979> God<00:01:20.400> says<00:01:20.700> it's<00:01:20.909> saying<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.600> what

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
about it God says it's saying and what

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.240 
about it God says it's saying and what
about<00:01:22.740> sin<00:01:23.220> he<00:01:23.790> says<00:01:24.030> repent<00:01:24.740> tells<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.950> church

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
about sin he says repent tells a church

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.780 
about sin he says repent tells a church
to<00:01:26.580> repent<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:28.170> think<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:29.460> ought<00:01:29.490> to

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
to repent so I think that you ought to

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.319 
to repent so I think that you ought to
repent<00:01:30.210> for<00:01:31.079> several<00:01:31.950> reasons<00:01:32.130> one<00:01:32.610> reason<00:01:33.119> is

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
repent for several reasons one reason is

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.870 
repent for several reasons one reason is
to<00:01:33.689> make<00:01:33.900> sure<00:01:33.930> if<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:35.310> didn't<00:01:35.700> need<00:01:35.820> to

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
to make sure if you didn't need to

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.929 
to make sure if you didn't need to
repent<00:01:36.479> then<00:01:37.140> hallelujah<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:38.490> didn't<00:01:38.820> need

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
repent then hallelujah you didn't need

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.569 
repent then hallelujah you didn't need
to<00:01:39.180> repent<00:01:39.600> but<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.470> thing<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.710> you'd<00:01:41.130> need<00:01:41.369> to

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
to repent but the thing is you'd need to

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.600 
to repent but the thing is you'd need to
repent<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.329> this<00:01:43.110> party<00:01:43.710> goes<00:01:43.890> on<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.369> say

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
repent and this party goes on to say

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.510 
repent and this party goes on to say
that<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:45.210> certain<00:01:45.720> radio<00:01:46.170> teacher<00:01:46.560> has<00:01:47.009> taught

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
that a certain radio teacher has taught

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.270 
that a certain radio teacher has taught
this<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.090> it's<00:01:48.840> become<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.290> problem<00:01:49.950> in<00:01:50.100> our

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
this and it's become a problem in our

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.330 
this and it's become a problem in our
church<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:51.030> believe<00:01:51.899> that<00:01:52.110> we<00:01:52.290> should<00:01:52.350> ask<00:01:52.920> for

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
church I believe that we should ask for

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.940 
church I believe that we should ask for
forgiveness<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:54.350> that<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.380> course<00:01:55.560> is

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
forgiveness and that of course is

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.240 
forgiveness and that of course is
repentance<00:01:56.700> repentance<00:01:57.659> by<00:01:58.439> any<00:01:58.619> other<00:01:58.829> name

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
repentance repentance by any other name

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.080 
repentance repentance by any other name
will<00:01:59.909> be<00:02:00.630> as<00:02:00.780> effective<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:02.640> model

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
will be as effective and the model

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.679 
will be as effective and the model
prayer<00:02:03.420> in<00:02:03.719> Matthew<00:02:04.320> 6<00:02:04.710> is<00:02:04.979> being<00:02:05.850> used<00:02:06.149> that's

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
prayer in Matthew 6 is being used that's

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.710 
prayer in Matthew 6 is being used that's
not<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.020> prayer<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:08.069> sinning<00:02:08.520> st.<00:02:08.879> at<00:02:09.179> all

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
not the prayer of a sinning st. at all

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.280 
not the prayer of a sinning st. at all
that's<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.619> model<00:02:11.099> for<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:12.330> prayer

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
that's a model for the prayer

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.429 
that's a model for the prayer
one<00:02:13.530> and<00:02:13.920> fellowship<00:02:14.519> with<00:02:14.730> God<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:15.439> this

one and fellowship with God and this
part<00:02:16.739> says<00:02:16.829> I<00:02:17.069> believe<00:02:17.519> that<00:02:17.549> when<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.180> Holy

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
part says I believe that when the Holy

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.420
