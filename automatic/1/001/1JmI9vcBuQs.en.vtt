00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
how you make them so you just cut the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.449

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:18.579 
and then you cut it so you just cut a

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:21.839 
and then you cut it so you just cut a
small<00:02:18.609> thing<00:02:19.480> so<00:02:20.170> they<00:02:20.290> just<00:02:20.469> cut<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.069> end<00:02:21.730> of

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
small thing so they just cut the end of

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.360

the<00:02:21.969> straw<00:02:22.480> off<00:02:22.780> and<00:02:23.079> then<00:02:23.200> you<00:02:23.319> cut<00:02:23.560> a<00:02:23.769> little

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
the straw off and then you cut a little

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.500 
the straw off and then you cut a little
slot<00:02:25.060> so<00:02:25.780> it<00:02:26.620> could<00:02:27.040> go<00:02:27.459> around<00:02:27.670> your<00:02:28.090> LPS's

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
slot so it could go around your LPS's

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.709 
slot so it could go around your LPS's
LPS's

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:31.719 
LPS's

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:37.289 
LPS's
yeah<00:02:32.769> I<00:02:34.920> bet<00:02:35.920> they'll<00:02:36.069> be<00:02:36.219> really<00:02:36.430> pretty<00:02:36.849> once

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
yeah I bet they'll be really pretty once

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.599 
yeah I bet they'll be really pretty once
you<00:02:37.780> put<00:02:37.989> some<00:02:38.139> rhinestones<00:02:38.739> on<00:02:38.950> but<00:02:39.219> I<00:02:39.250> think

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:39.609 
you put some rhinestones on but I think

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:42.539 
you put some rhinestones on but I think
she<00:02:39.879> looks<00:02:40.150> pretty<00:02:40.599> enough<00:02:41.530> with<00:02:41.919> just<00:02:42.430> a

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
she looks pretty enough with just a

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.170 
she looks pretty enough with just a
plain<00:02:42.819> old<00:02:42.849> pink<00:02:43.950> because<00:02:44.950> pink<00:02:45.010> looks<00:02:45.909> good

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180
