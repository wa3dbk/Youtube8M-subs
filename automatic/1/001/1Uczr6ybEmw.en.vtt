00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
next few months that's them december

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.169 
next few months that's them december
january<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:28.019> i'm<00:00:28.289> assuming<00:00:28.619> into<00:00:29.429> februari

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
january and i'm assuming into februari

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.770 
january and i'm assuming into februari
so<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.199> first<00:00:31.439> update<00:00:31.710> is<00:00:32.570> going<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.630> be<00:00:33.750> a

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
so the first update is going to be a

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.360 
so the first update is going to be a
minimal<00:00:34.350> change<00:00:34.649> but<00:00:34.860> it's<00:00:34.980> actually<00:00:35.100> going

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
minimal change but it's actually going

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.720 
minimal change but it's actually going
to<00:00:35.460> reduce<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.090> size<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:37.219> previous<00:00:38.219> patches

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
to reduce the size of previous patches

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.850 
to reduce the size of previous patches
so<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.570> should<00:00:39.809> free<00:00:40.050> up<00:00:40.079> about<00:00:40.590> eight<00:00:40.829> hundred

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
so it should free up about eight hundred

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.850 
so it should free up about eight hundred
megabytes<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.969> space<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:43.350> if<00:00:43.559> you've<00:00:43.739> already
