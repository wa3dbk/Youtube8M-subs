00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
straight lines they sort of where the

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.389 
straight lines they sort of where the
digitizer<00:00:35.460> itself<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.469> sort<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.530> stuck<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:38.280> the

outside of LCD screen underneath the
detail<00:00:43.739> screen<00:00:43.980> itself<00:00:44.840> so<00:00:45.840> we<00:00:46.260> can<00:00:46.559> use<00:00:46.890> these

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
detail screen itself so we can use these

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.490 
detail screen itself so we can use these
to<00:00:47.640> be<00:00:47.760> able<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.300> get<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.660> screen<00:00:48.930> off<00:00:49.140> at<00:00:49.440> the

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
to be able to get the screen off at the

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.970 
to be able to get the screen off at the
same<00:00:49.739> time<00:00:50.039> they<00:00:50.730> are<00:00:50.760> very<00:00:51.239> close<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:52.500> now<00:00:52.649> see

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
same time they are very close to now see

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.790 
same time they are very close to now see
you<00:00:53.039> can<00:00:53.460> see<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.730> up<00:00:54.230> subsea<00:00:55.230> actually<00:00:55.649> move

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
you can see it up subsea actually move

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.290 
you can see it up subsea actually move
similar<00:00:58.800> as<00:00:59.670> well<00:01:01.340> so<00:01:02.340> worried<00:01:02.640> we<00:01:02.789> can<00:01:03.000> use

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
similar as well so worried we can use

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.270 
similar as well so worried we can use
those<00:01:03.510> quite<00:01:03.809> easily<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.439> be<00:01:04.530> able<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.949> start

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
those quite easily to be able to start

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.580 
those quite easily to be able to start
to<00:01:05.489> get<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.729> screen<00:01:05.970> up<00:01:06.090> at<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.299> same<00:01:06.540> time<00:01:06.840> it

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
to get the screen up at the same time it

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.890 
to get the screen up at the same time it
is<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.950> bit<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.159> danger<00:01:08.580> but<00:01:08.729> we'll<00:01:08.939> tackle<00:01:09.630> it

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
is a bit of a danger but we'll tackle it

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.350 
is a bit of a danger but we'll tackle it
so<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.290> what<00:01:10.530> we<00:01:10.680> always<00:01:10.830> do<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.400> yeah<00:01:12.299> you

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
adhesive there's holding it down which

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.039 
adhesive there's holding it down which
is<00:01:29.310> fine<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.909> something<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.329> we<00:01:30.540> usually<00:01:30.900> do

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
is fine and something that we usually do

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.230 
is fine and something that we usually do
but<00:01:31.740> right<00:01:31.950> now<00:01:32.009> all<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.640> really<00:01:32.909> doing<00:01:33.150> is

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
but right now all is really doing is

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.460 
but right now all is really doing is
breaking<00:01:33.450> up<00:01:33.860> the<00:01:34.860> screen<00:01:35.130> itself<00:01:35.369> this<00:01:35.790> here

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
breaking up the screen itself this here

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.340 
breaking up the screen itself this here
is<00:01:37.470> still<00:01:37.829> sort<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.369> stuck<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.939> LCD<00:01:39.630> would

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
is still sort of stuck to the LCD would

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.170 
is still sort of stuck to the LCD would
like<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.560> foamy<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.040> decent<00:01:41.520> all<00:01:41.700> round<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:42.060> edge

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
like a foamy a decent all round the edge

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.330 
like a foamy a decent all round the edge
that's<00:01:42.810> actually<00:01:43.020> still<00:01:43.439> stopped<00:01:43.740> down<00:01:43.979> once

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
that's actually still stopped down once

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.830 
that's actually still stopped down once
the<00:01:44.520> wood

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
the wood

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.380 
the wood
actually<00:01:45.289> released<00:01:45.740> any<00:01:46.340> parts<00:01:47.000> of<00:01:47.149> the

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
actually released any parts of the

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.120 
actually released any parts of the
digitizer<00:01:48.020> at<00:01:48.229> the<00:01:48.350> moment<00:01:48.770> which<00:01:48.920> we

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
digitizer at the moment which we

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.249 
digitizer at the moment which we
normally<00:01:49.340> would<00:01:50.299> have<00:01:50.420> been<00:01:50.539> able<00:01:50.659> to<00:01:50.840> do<00:01:51.020> by

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
normally would have been able to do by

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.849 
normally would have been able to do by
now<00:01:51.439> but<00:01:51.649> because<00:01:51.920> it's<00:01:52.100> broken<00:01:52.399> on<00:01:52.670> so<00:01:52.939> much

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:53.859 
now but because it's broken on so much

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:56.169 
now but because it's broken on so much
the<00:01:54.859> best<00:01:55.039> thing<00:01:55.130> we<00:01:55.340> can<00:01:55.399> do<00:01:55.640> is<00:01:55.670> sort<00:01:55.909> of<00:01:56.000> get

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
the best thing we can do is sort of get

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:58.029 
the best thing we can do is sort of get
on<00:01:56.329> a<00:01:56.359> half<00:01:56.659> out<00:01:56.990> of<00:01:57.049> the<00:01:57.200> way<00:01:57.319> make<00:01:57.590> it<00:01:57.770> safe

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
on a half out of the way make it safe

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:00.279 
on a half out of the way make it safe
and<00:01:58.759> then<00:01:58.939> we<00:01:59.030> can<00:01:59.210> move<00:01:59.329> on<00:01:59.569> we're<00:02:00.020> just<00:02:00.170> about

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
and then we can move on we're just about

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.440 
and then we can move on we're just about
ready<00:02:00.409> to<00:02:00.649> move<00:02:00.920> on<00:02:01.100> with<00:02:01.130> that<00:02:01.520> I'm<00:02:02.209> going<00:02:02.390> to

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
ready to move on with that I'm going to

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.249 
ready to move on with that I'm going to
try<00:02:02.719> to<00:02:03.110> get<00:02:03.799> this<00:02:03.920> Ejiofor<00:02:04.610> if<00:02:04.729> not<00:02:05.030> it's<00:02:05.959> all

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
try to get this Ejiofor if not it's all

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.469 
try to get this Ejiofor if not it's all
this<00:02:06.439> is<00:02:06.590> just<00:02:06.770> going<00:02:06.890> to<00:02:06.950> come<00:02:07.130> away<00:02:07.250> and<00:02:08.179> like

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
this is just going to come away and like

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.449 
this is just going to come away and like
the<00:02:08.720> rest<00:02:08.959> has<00:02:09.200> i'm<00:02:09.619> thinking<00:02:10.099> it's<00:02:10.220> just

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
the rest has i'm thinking it's just

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.580 
the rest has i'm thinking it's just
going<00:02:10.610> to<00:02:10.670> sort<00:02:10.759> of<00:02:10.849> come<00:02:11.060> by<00:02:11.209> and<00:02:11.390> break<00:02:11.599> up<00:02:11.870> as

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
going to sort of come by and break up as

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.830 
going to sort of come by and break up as
i<00:02:12.769> try<00:02:12.950> to<00:02:13.010> move<00:02:13.250> a<00:02:13.310> lot<00:02:13.519> now<00:02:14.299> it's<00:02:14.450> not<00:02:14.569> simply

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
i try to move a lot now it's not simply

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.440 
i try to move a lot now it's not simply
for<00:02:15.019> problem<00:02:15.379> now<00:02:15.530> once<00:02:15.830> all<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.580> sort<00:02:17.390> of

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
for problem now once all the sort of

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.920 
for problem now once all the sort of
weaker<00:02:17.900> broken<00:02:18.530> glass<00:02:18.769> is<00:02:19.099> off<00:02:19.489> then<00:02:20.450> we'll<00:02:20.840> be

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
weaker broken glass is off then we'll be

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.289 
weaker broken glass is off then we'll be
able<00:02:21.079> to<00:02:21.290> actually<00:02:21.739> go<00:02:22.340> to<00:02:22.400> screen<00:02:22.760> up<00:02:22.910> spoke

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
able to actually go to screen up spoke

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:26.380 
able to actually go to screen up spoke
and<00:02:23.630> it<00:02:23.690> look<00:02:23.810> like<00:02:24.019> a<00:02:24.049> book<00:02:24.290> and<00:02:25.209> then<00:02:26.209> we'll

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
and it look like a book and then we'll

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.420 
and it look like a book and then we'll
move<00:02:26.599> on<00:02:26.780> from<00:02:26.989> there<00:02:27.560> with<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:27.950> repair<00:02:28.250> all

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
move on from there with the repair all

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.220 
move on from there with the repair all
right<00:02:28.579> here<00:02:28.790> we<00:02:28.819> are<00:02:29.030> we've<00:02:29.299> got<00:02:29.870> the<00:02:29.959> screen

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
right here we are we've got the screen

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.030 
right here we are we've got the screen
up<00:02:30.530> as<00:02:30.769> you<00:02:31.160> can<00:02:31.340> see<00:02:31.700> most<00:02:32.209> of<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:32.660> age<00:02:33.110> which

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
up as you can see most of the age which

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.770 
up as you can see most of the age which
is<00:02:34.220> completely<00:02:34.700> broken<00:02:34.910> away<00:02:35.239> a<00:02:35.329> pretty<00:02:35.660> much

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
is completely broken away a pretty much

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.199 
is completely broken away a pretty much
at<00:02:35.959> all<00:02:35.989> apart<00:02:36.500> from<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.769> bottom<00:02:37.220> one<00:02:37.970> home

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
at all apart from the bottom one home

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.930 
at all apart from the bottom one home
button<00:02:38.660> is<00:02:38.780> that's<00:02:39.019> not<00:02:39.200> looking<00:02:39.590> too<00:02:39.769> bad<00:02:39.940> but

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
button is that's not looking too bad but

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.180 
button is that's not looking too bad but
we've<00:02:41.090> got<00:02:41.269> this<00:02:41.480> while<00:02:42.110> we<00:02:42.230> have<00:02:42.379> now<00:02:42.620> so<00:02:43.010> what

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
we've got this while we have now so what

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.400 
we've got this while we have now so what
we're<00:02:43.310> going<00:02:43.400> to<00:02:43.489> do<00:02:43.610> is<00:02:44.000> take<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:44.510> LCD<00:02:45.079> screen

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
we're going to do is take the LCD screen

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.770 
we're going to do is take the LCD screen
out<00:02:45.760> take<00:02:46.760> that<00:02:46.910> completely<00:02:47.390> out<00:02:47.629> of<00:02:47.660> the

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
out take that completely out of the

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.120 
out take that completely out of the
equation<00:02:48.670> so<00:02:49.670> that<00:02:49.700> it's<00:02:50.000> safe<00:02:50.630> and<00:02:50.989> kept<00:02:51.260> mark

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
equation so that it's safe and kept mark

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.640 
equation so that it's safe and kept mark
free<00:02:52.670> then<00:02:53.569> we'll<00:02:53.930> move<00:02:54.079> on<00:02:54.290> to<00:02:54.319> worth

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
free then we'll move on to worth

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.220 
free then we'll move on to worth
replacing<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:55.790> touch<00:02:55.970> ok<00:02:56.450> here<00:02:56.660> we<00:02:56.690> had<00:02:56.930> quite

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
replacing the touch ok here we had quite

an<00:02:57.350> empty<00:02:57.739> locking<00:02:58.630> iPad<00:02:59.630> what's<00:03:00.160> done

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
an empty locking iPad what's done

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.640 
an empty locking iPad what's done
obviously<00:03:01.819> the<00:03:01.970> LCD<00:03:02.420> screens<00:03:02.840> been<00:03:03.109> taken<00:03:03.530> out

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
obviously the LCD screens been taken out

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.920 
obviously the LCD screens been taken out
the<00:03:03.889> touch<00:03:04.099> screen<00:03:04.239> has<00:03:05.239> been<00:03:05.450> removed<00:03:05.720> as

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
the touch screen has been removed as

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.140 
the touch screen has been removed as
well<00:03:05.989> and<00:03:06.910> so<00:03:07.910> the<00:03:08.450> edge<00:03:08.660> is<00:03:09.200> also<00:03:09.859> inside<00:03:10.639> it

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
well and so the edge is also inside it

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.900 
well and so the edge is also inside it
up<00:03:11.380> the<00:03:12.380> reason<00:03:12.620> for<00:03:12.650> those<00:03:13.010> so<00:03:13.250> that<00:03:13.430> it<00:03:13.579> gives

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
up the reason for those so that it gives

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.500 
up the reason for those so that it gives
a<00:03:14.299> nice<00:03:14.900> clean<00:03:15.319> surface<00:03:15.650> for<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.639> new<00:03:17.209> screen
