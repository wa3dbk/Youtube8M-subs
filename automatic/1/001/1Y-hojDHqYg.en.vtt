00:00:04.099 --> 00:00:08.910
 friends, hello, you are watching the news 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.589
 avatar technology 30 release 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.940
 as usual on mondays we 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:14.759
 tell you about important events 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.410
 a week of sulfur technology 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.720
 artificial cyber medicine body 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.580
 robotics on but also biotechnology 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.130
 let's start scientists from the British 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.199
 University of choice created a system 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.480
 speech imitations for people who cannot 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.369
 speak independently device 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.859
 based on the user's breath and 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.080
 consists of a mask on the mouth and nose associated 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.850
 hose with computer system to learn 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.510
 together with the user and helps 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.130
 to form 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.560
 vocabulary stock that fits 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.030
 to a specific person 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.890
 the patient breathes in a specific pattern and 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.720
 software handles 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.550
 drawing breath and assigns it 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.710
 specific word or phrase 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.810
 this is a collaboration of developers and 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.220
 patient but after the signals 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.200
 breaths have been identified 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.150
 computer recognizes ninety seven s 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.590
 half percent of the words and the synthesizer 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.590
 speech reproduces them 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.929
 since breathing is physiological 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.509
 process that do not require facial 

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:11.729
 movements or muscle tension of the limbs 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:14.130
 the device can help people communicate with 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.170
 severe muscle weakness impaired 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.460
 speech as a result of a stroke and even 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.560
 patients on artificial ventilation 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.090
 lungs 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.130
 biologists have created some unusual 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.840
 strains of bacteria and pooled kabil 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.659
 computer able to control the behavior 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.369
 some other microbes in perspective this 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.490
 allow scientists to create high-grade 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.649
 live logic circuits by matthew bennett of 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.259
 rice university in houston usa 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.210
 his colleagues put in 2 different strains 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.340
 usually E. coli two 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.920
 opposite genes 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.960
 which made these bacteria 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.100
 synthesize signaling molecules 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.079
 enable or disable shia sets 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.299
 genes in 3 bacterial populations 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.109
 if you put all three strains of the bacteria into 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.880
 one tube 

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:56.730
 reference oscillator occurs 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.740
 sort of electronic jerseys letting 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.230
 synchronize the work of other devices 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.820
 with perspective such logic with 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.440
 using bacteria can 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.880
 used in medicine 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.620
 biocomputer and able to manage 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.900
 activity of microorganisms in the intestines 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:13.710
 and regulate the substances they produce 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.170
 american molecular biologists 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.000
 have developed a development management method 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.550
 embryonic stem cells with 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.770
 using light pulses it allows 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.380
 convert sex cells to neurons 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.240
 or other types of mature cells at the right 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.740
 point in time scientists from university 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.420
 california to san francisco 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.920
 experimented with embryonic 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.020
 modified stem cells 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.780
 mice in which under the influence of 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.580
 blue laser pulses turned on 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.160
 stem cell transformation program 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.440
 neurons scientists have discovered that stem 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.810
 cells have an internal stopwatch 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.970
 and a system of molecular signals that 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.680
 manage their subsequent specialization 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.600
 using the system and editing 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.460
 genome researchers have tagged a gene 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.740
 inhibit stem cell transformation 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.110
 other fabrics and attached to it 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.690
 DNA coding fluorescent region 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.190
 protein tag using a microscope scientists 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.830
 could see how the stem cell 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.420
 makes decisions developers hope 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.130
 that over time they can 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.260
 program stem cells 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.330
 recognize rays of light of different colors 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.370
 which will run the program 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.730
 cell conversion specific type 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.830
