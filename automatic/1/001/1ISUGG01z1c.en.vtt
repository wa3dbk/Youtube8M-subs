00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
humongous indoor water park and one of

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.569 
humongous indoor water park and one of
the<00:00:31.050> leg<00:00:31.199> ride<00:00:31.410> type<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:31.980> things<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.309> can<00:00:32.430> do

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
the leg ride type of things you can do

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.370 
the leg ride type of things you can do
it's<00:00:32.759> like<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.880> giant<00:00:33.180> slide<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.840> simulates<00:00:34.110> a

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
it's like a giant slide that simulates a

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.229 
it's like a giant slide that simulates a
wave<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:34.890> just<00:00:35.040> like<00:00:35.160> shoots<00:00:35.489> like<00:00:35.820> Jets

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
wave and it just like shoots like Jets

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.850 
wave and it just like shoots like Jets
of<00:00:36.420> water<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.930> make<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.170> look<00:00:37.290> like<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.440> wave<00:00:37.649> and

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
of water to make it look like a wave and

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.290 
of water to make it look like a wave and
feel<00:00:38.040> like<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.250> wave<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:38.760> my<00:00:38.850> opinion<00:00:38.940> it's

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
feel like a wave and in my opinion it's

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.580 
feel like a wave and in my opinion it's
probably<00:00:39.570> one<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.870> most<00:00:39.960> fun<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.440> cool

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
probably one of the most fun and cool

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.780
