00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:13.200
 the transition is in the trial of this vice already 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.680
 because these classes today seemed like a 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.110
 more pilot makeup over 20 others 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.180
 thus more oil the more grotesque 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.300
 I see very soft eyes almost not only have 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.340
 shadow the face too much will outline 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.189
 has a what of the seller no more nothing 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.349
 and a young man promises to invest in 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.850
 several countries of the rose can use 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.590
 the courses you want 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.329
 It's a very simple fair I hope 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.810
 You like it and if you want to see how it is 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.370
 that there is this great 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:45.120
 so I started in the tutorial by 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.520
 use tite may be more is the new one in 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.910
 animals and the body shop that is 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.880
 very good because it helps reduce 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:58.920
 the pores then through the base I used two 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:02.010
 bases this is the team wanted and did everything 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.329
 most fashionable the king in london 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.200
 I joined because I wanted to pay my ideal tone 

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:10.409
 for the return 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.360
 I do I approached the apothecary crisis 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.540
 most were in dark circles 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:19.140
 to the little field to the navy to 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.510
 brighten up one face to the dust and this 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.790
 just leave the thing and two products that I 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:27.350
 I did not like it because this 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.350
 dust around 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:37.770
 the delphi collapse then thinking for the 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.710
 eyes 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.900
 I started by applying one first you 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.460
 can see the people to marry but I do not even 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.390
 always boost production 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.390
 gross fell to show I crossed little 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:55.049
 or suspension of the brand alloy you can 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.280
 find the chef to eucleia through 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.000
 line of three 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.670
 only 32 of this waste of this planet 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.950
 It was the same tone that is a black and 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.399
 What I did was stepping with a brush. 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.729
 flattened by the eyebrow to 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.000
 to give one more thrashing 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.940
 will not take more security after the 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.250
 crisis and this both for the lightest 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.670
 the mobile eyelid applies throughout 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.200
 eyelid on the following apply with the 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.810
 brush overridden 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.250
 this one in the dark the crisis is very 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.970
 few people listen to what I did not want 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.040
 do the very heavily loaded tom cruise 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.680
 it's just a bit with the sole brush 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.890
 into the concave and then comes with the 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:43.970
 olimpo smoking brush and 20 seas 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:46.040
 brown is very well spread touching 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.519
 sometimes it was supposed to be a bit 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.730
 more intensity but does not change the 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:55.430
 Then what I did was do the dna that 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:59.239
 It is the most important part of the test 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:03.470
 letter z these are the stable wing and it is quite 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:05.629
 Good, and I like it because I do not blush it's not 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.560
 It is a very waterproof but it is a 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:08.660
 honor 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.299
 What happens I undo over the 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.489
 My day is very many hours. 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:15.709
 enough has a little point like this 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.239
 faces you need to have a bit of 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.239
 be careful because if you're not careful 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.790
 with her she is able because she was more 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:25.069
 easy a bath that is worth it 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.620
 to do what team I did what 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:30.319
 I did and look at the mirror in more or 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:35.120
 less as the other side was doing 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:41.030
 point and then just corn beyond 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:43.280
 crisis a white pencil has no name is the 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.709
 haiti ready the cruise beyond the water but 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.340
 very gently and put a 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:53.030
 little under the cheerful and then I came 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:55.989
 with 14s in and tries to clean and key cet 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:04:02.660
 even just getting a very thin white 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:06.530

 a brand a magic 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.180
 and another is fiber therefore and what exists 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.980
 and I think by his words in the attributes 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.250
 I do not remember well anymore 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.019
 the a3 a4 did not leave much like it very much 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.150
 used because they make more 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:26.060
 influence you can see same defense 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.190
 to make a huge difference hospitals 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.220
 which are actually very very large 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:35.270
 It's a product that I love. 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:37.700
 now by the face the face and another there and 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.700
 I made the illuminating west all with a 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:43.790
 it only pointed that this tip kicks 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:46.820
 henrique that is the human face color light 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:49.160

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:53.000
 an annulled potential 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:55.880
 I then applied the ash with
