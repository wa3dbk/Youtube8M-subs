00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300

skin<00:00:54.690> types<00:00:54.899> too<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.559> then<00:00:56.129> we<00:00:56.309> have<00:00:56.519> really

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
skin types too and then we have really

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.259 
skin types too and then we have really
intense<00:00:57.719> colors<00:00:58.079> like<00:00:58.320> this<00:00:58.589> one<00:00:59.059> more<00:01:00.059> like

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
intense colors like this one more like

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:03.559 
intense colors like this one more like
me<00:01:00.719> on<00:01:00.929> so<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.829> thought<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.850> was<00:01:02.999> this<00:01:03.390> was

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:03.569 
me on so I thought that it was this was

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:06.680 
me on so I thought that it was this was
kind<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.899> cool<00:01:04.080> because<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.680> dries<00:01:05.610> matte<00:01:06.000> so

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
kind of cool because it dries matte so

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.690 
kind of cool because it dries matte so
this<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.380> kind<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.770> different<00:01:07.980> I<00:01:08.340> don't<00:01:08.550> know

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
this is kind of different I don't know

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.120 
this is kind of different I don't know
why<00:01:08.940> usually<00:01:09.810> they<00:01:10.050> don't<00:01:10.080> tell<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.800> that<00:01:11.010> it

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
why usually they don't tell you that it

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.870 
why usually they don't tell you that it
dries<00:01:11.400> matte<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:13.260> majority<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:14.010> of

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
dries matte so the majority of the of

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.930 
dries matte so the majority of the of
the<00:01:15.240> ones<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.510> i<00:01:15.630> have<00:01:15.900> here<00:01:15.930> they're<00:01:16.940> kind

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
the ones that i have here they're kind

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.840 
the ones that i have here they're kind
of<00:01:18.090> shiny<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:19.410> but<00:01:19.860> this<00:01:20.010> one<00:01:20.160> dries<00:01:20.370> matte<00:01:20.580> and

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
of shiny so but this one dries matte and

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.430 
of shiny so but this one dries matte and

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
really nice and it dries up really

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.839 
really nice and it dries up really
really<00:02:56.720> fast<00:02:57.139> and<00:02:58.129> it's<00:02:59.980> but<00:03:00.980> when<00:03:01.159> you<00:03:01.310> put<00:03:01.609> on
