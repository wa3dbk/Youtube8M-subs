00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello welcome to our channel 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.390
 soria natural today we will teach you to 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.290
 cooking good more than cooking to cook 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.450
 our seitan is correct with the ine 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.849
 lucas to prepare this dish we are going to 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.160
 need our it and red pepper 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.789
 green pepper tomato tender onion 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:24.090
 carrot potato bouillon vegetable oil 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.800
 salt and spices cumin pepper and thyme 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.539
 It looks like it's going to be a recipe when 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.189
 you hear the word notice that it's going to be 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.380
 long that's going to be the opposite is 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.640
 a very quick cooking recipe for 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.890
 what we are going to start doing is 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.370
 make the stir-fry then let's go 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.320
 what is the chive in quarters 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.030
 and we are going to add it now so that 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.980
 go suffering 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.660
 let's put a pinch of red pepper 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.790
 it is necessary to split the vegetable very 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.040
 because then we're going to let's go 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.190
 to go is much faster at home than 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.660
 prepare the sofrito we are going to do it in 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.170
 big 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.170
 ah 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.280
 adding 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.280
 a carrot 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.990
 let's start to start 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.759
 sofreír know 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.759
 and we will also put a tomato 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.120
 but we will also start it in 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.440
 rooms 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.440
 and again in quarters 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.670
 let's add a pinch of a pinch of 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.670
 Salt 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.600
 once we have our vegetables or 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.140
 fried what we are going to do is add 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.120
 our vegetable broth 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.960
 and let's cook for half an hour 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.960
 quietly 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.970
 and we will let it cook 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.270
 after our half hour of cooking what 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.020
 what we have done has been crush and strain 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.840
 for a colander 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.000
 the result is this fine sauce and 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.670
 tasty is worth once we have 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.010
 our last sauce we are going to add 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.620
 our aromatic herbs in this case 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.860
 a little bit of thyme a little 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:29.470
 cumin and a pinch of pepper 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.660
 what we are going to do is cook the 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.820
 potato we are going to cache the very 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.010
 very spicy little ones because you do not know 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.870
 seitan and a very short cooking then 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.120
 we will know it almost simultaneously the 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.300
 potato with the seitan we are going to 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.300
 Introduce 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:51.030
 let's proceed separately from the 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.030
 Seitan is such a spongy site 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.310
 We will let you know a little and 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.630
 while we are going to want to contribute a 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.000
 little bit more of flavor and texture with 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:04.319
 some mushrooms we're going to put we're going 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.319
 starting also like this in 4 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:11.659
 I would like you to see him as the seitan 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.040
 that they carry or they take a couple of minutes already 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:15.319
 it has swollen that means that 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.750
 is already absorbing all our flavor 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:21.260
 of the sauce that is being produced at the 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:24.010
 cooking we will leave 5 minutes and we have a 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.329
 stew super fast made and super tasty 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.280
 once our minutes of 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.840
 cooking here we have our result and 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.390
 what we are going to do is to get 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.250
 place what we put on 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.750

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.750
 potato and mushroom 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:46.239
 we are going to put a little bit of 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:49.120
 raw mushroom to give it that scent 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.680
 mushroom and we are going to put 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.930
