 We'll show you how to cope with this squad like yours 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:18.920
 Do not connect devices 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.619
 very easily 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.080
 First, they should then follow the users 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.440
 Of course this is only possible if you use analogue or digital cable 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.290
 or will this cable become your percent one goes for the ban 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.980
 the waterslide looks like this and then Hanau suits that I have in the back 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.790
 purely 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.150
 everyone is going to see parents need to receive program via satellite 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.770

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.620
 this they top May in the most that gave the mayor for 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.670
 Siemens is already Bavaria, the HD received and then via HDMI or the 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.480
 complete squad encounter our new the first time that he will now be sure of 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.070
 first but closed 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.070
 Just put this prop in the back 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.700
 Disadvantage otherwise because connection is that the picture quality is not quite optimal 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.020
 big advantage in turn is the image and sound to be transmitted simultaneously 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.590
 and she no longer Karl Koch 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.890
 even most dvd-player dvd-recorder or 4s video recorders will be Asgard 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.020
 affiliated 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.940
 it is better to connect the devices per component that is a three years 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.430
 that cable 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.920
 there goes the much higher picture quality over the disadvantage 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.710
 however, that no reason more money for it they need one more 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.880
 Two-wheeler is supposed to stack the stereotype 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.439

 When shooting the cable, you must pay attention to the plug in 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.600
 to strengthen the right boxes 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.530
 especially the Oderstadt must necessarily in the with per

 at the blue wpb and at 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.950
 Green we have to number 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.890
 Now you have to connect the audio cable 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.399
 There are several times on television they take the connections in the

 the dvd-player and dvd-recorder you can already connect Colony today 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.650

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:44.499
 she could also connect a PC to her TV CD and the CD 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:46.289
 Plasma televisions today offer this 

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:50.169
 on the one hand, this is via VW aka have their graphics card one of the 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:51.149

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:59.059
 can connect 

00:02:59.059 --> 00:03:02.579
 Many current devices also offer a LAN socket today, meaning they can 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.519
 to recognize their staggered with such a plan worked out 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.769
 they then run Internet services or they can content
