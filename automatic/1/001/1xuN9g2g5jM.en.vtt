00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
than that though I usually always use a

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.990 
than that though I usually always use a
stone<00:01:02.879> path<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.449> do<00:01:03.539> not<00:01:03.899> know<00:01:04.140> why<00:01:04.850> you<00:01:05.850> can

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
stone path I do not know why you can

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.539 
stone path I do not know why you can
also<00:01:06.150> if<00:01:06.570> you're<00:01:06.720> like<00:01:06.960> lazy<00:01:07.500> like<00:01:07.890> me<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.400> can

also just use this right here okay you
can<00:01:11.580> click<00:01:11.790> this<00:01:11.970> one<00:01:12.180> for<00:01:12.420> no<00:01:12.600> slope<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.200> see

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
can click this one for no slope you see

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.200 
can click this one for no slope you see
where<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.619> says<00:01:13.650> right<00:01:14.220> there<00:01:14.250> in<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:14.939> little

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
where it says right there in that little

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.219 
where it says right there in that little
area<00:01:15.540> no<00:01:15.900> slope<00:01:16.250> or<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.549> can<00:01:17.700> raise<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:17.880> up

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
area no slope or you can raise it up

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.480 
area no slope or you can raise it up
kind<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.259> like<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.439> wheelchair<00:01:19.710> ramp<00:01:20.310> or

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
kind of like a wheelchair ramp or

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.789 
kind of like a wheelchair ramp or
whatever<00:01:20.729> or<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.330> can<00:01:21.630> make<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:22.020> stairs<00:01:22.409> to

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
whatever or you can make it stairs to

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.890 
whatever or you can make it stairs to
make<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.100> go<00:01:23.250> up<00:01:23.460> but<00:01:24.210> I'm<00:01:24.299> not<00:01:24.450> going<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.780> do

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
make it go up but I'm not going to do

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.429 
make it go up but I'm not going to do
that<00:01:25.110> I'm<00:01:25.320> just<00:01:25.380> going<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.280> use<00:01:26.460> no<00:01:26.759> slope<00:01:27.439> now

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
that I'm just going to use no slope now

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.039 
that I'm just going to use no slope now
this<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.400> that's<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.450> little<00:01:30.630> slower<00:01:30.930> to

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
this is that that's a little slower to

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.830 
this is that that's a little slower to
use<00:01:31.380> unless<00:01:31.770> you're<00:01:32.490> just<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:33.030> know<00:01:33.060> but<00:01:33.600> like

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
use unless you're just you know but like

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.249 
use unless you're just you know but like
yeah<00:01:34.530> this<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.340> little<00:01:35.640> faster<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:36.060> use

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
yeah this is a little faster to use

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:38.149 
yeah this is a little faster to use
normally<00:01:37.259> I'm<00:01:37.350> gonna<00:01:37.530> put<00:01:37.650> trees<00:01:37.890> in<00:01:38.070> the

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
normally I'm gonna put trees in the

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.890 
normally I'm gonna put trees in the
middle<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.460> there<00:01:38.579> but<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:38.850> see<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.360> just

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
middle of there but you see I just

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.120 
middle of there but you see I just
continue<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.470> later

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
continue that later

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.249 
continue that later

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
flat and it can let go underneath it

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.100 
flat and it can let go underneath it
like<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.040> tunnel<00:02:05.369> sort<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.210> been<00:02:06.420> away<00:02:06.630> see

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
but I mean I find it pretty pointless

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.809 
but I mean I find it pretty pointless
because<00:02:17.580> why<00:02:17.940> would<00:02:18.720> you<00:02:18.989> really<00:02:19.950> want<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.610> use

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
because why would you really want to use

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.610 
because why would you really want to use
that<00:02:21.150> but<00:02:21.330> I<00:02:21.390> don't<00:02:21.660> know<00:02:21.810> that's<00:02:22.170> your<00:02:22.410> that's

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.890 
that but I don't know that's your that's
your<00:02:22.769> own<00:02:22.980> decision<00:02:23.599> well<00:02:24.599> yeah<00:02:24.720> I'm<00:02:24.810> gonna

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900

it<00:03:53.680> realistic<00:03:54.130> which<00:03:54.520> is<00:03:54.670> what<00:03:54.820> I<00:03:55.000> love<00:03:55.360> to<00:03:55.630> do

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
it realistic which is what I love to do

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.590 
it realistic which is what I love to do
make<00:03:56.830> it<00:03:56.980> realistic<00:03:57.400> but<00:03:57.880> you<00:03:58.000> know<00:03:58.150> this<00:03:58.450> is

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
make it realistic but you know this is

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.790 
make it realistic but you know this is
how<00:03:58.750> much<00:03:58.990> peace

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
how much peace

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.940 
how much peace
we<00:03:59.980> usually<00:04:00.190> occupy<00:04:01.060> in<00:04:01.420> a<00:04:01.600> line<00:04:01.840> space

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
we usually occupy in a line space

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.250 
we usually occupy in a line space
um<00:04:05.040> so<00:04:06.040> if<00:04:06.130> you<00:04:06.250> use<00:04:06.460> a<00:04:06.490> cue<00:04:06.760> line<00:04:06.970> path<00:04:07.510> this<00:04:08.080> is

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
um so if you use a cue line path this is

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.140 
um so if you use a cue line path this is
what<00:04:08.440> keeps<00:04:08.650> me<00:04:08.920> used<00:04:09.100> to<00:04:09.280> wait<00:04:09.430> in<00:04:09.550> line<00:04:09.730> you

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
what keeps me used to wait in line you

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.720 
what keeps me used to wait in line you
do<00:04:11.050> not<00:04:11.230> need<00:04:11.440> to<00:04:11.620> use<00:04:11.770> it<00:04:11.980> for<00:04:12.010> an<00:04:12.250> exit

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
do not need to use it for an exit

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:13.980 
do not need to use it for an exit
because<00:04:13.060> that<00:04:13.330> would<00:04:13.630> be<00:04:13.720> completely

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:13.990 
because that would be completely

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.750 
because that would be completely
pointless<00:04:14.410> that<00:04:14.740> this<00:04:14.920> is<00:04:15.100> the<00:04:15.220> exit<00:04:15.610> for<00:04:15.730> the

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
pointless that this is the exit for the

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.509 
pointless that this is the exit for the
ride<00:04:16.000> right<00:04:16.030> here<00:04:16.590> use<00:04:17.590> a<00:04:17.620> regular<00:04:17.859> path<00:04:18.280> for

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
ride right here use a regular path for

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.770 
ride right here use a regular path for
that<00:04:20.160> and<00:04:21.160> you<00:04:21.310> connect<00:04:21.670> and<00:04:22.120> you<00:04:22.270> can<00:04:22.450> make<00:04:22.600> it

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
that and you connect and you can make it

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.090 
that and you connect and you can make it
the<00:04:24.090> B<00:04:25.090> connects<00:04:25.480> the<00:04:25.810> Q<00:04:25.990> line<00:04:26.140> have<00:04:26.410> to<00:04:26.860> be<00:04:26.980> in

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
the B connects the Q line have to be in

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.590 
the B connects the Q line have to be in
terms<00:04:27.250> of<00:04:27.460> your<00:04:27.610> ride<00:04:27.850> and<00:04:27.880> that's<00:04:28.270> how<00:04:28.420> people

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
terms of your ride and that's how people

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.860 
terms of your ride and that's how people
can<00:04:28.900> get<00:04:29.020> to<00:04:29.170> your<00:04:29.320> ride<00:04:30.480> well<00:04:31.480> that<00:04:31.690> just

can get to your ride well that just
