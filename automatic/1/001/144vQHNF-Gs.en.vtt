back in and the really cool thing that

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.410 
back in and the really cool thing that
we<00:02:36.980> get<00:02:37.069> to<00:02:37.160> do<00:02:37.280> with<00:02:37.430> that<00:02:37.549> is<00:02:37.760> like<00:02:38.209> when<00:02:38.330> you

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
we get to do with that is like when you

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.240

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
players tackle the challenges and you

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.969 
players tackle the challenges and you
know<00:04:40.389> there's<00:04:40.840> the<00:04:40.960> approach<00:04:41.259> that<00:04:41.289> we<00:04:41.470> expect

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
know there's the approach that we expect

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:43.170 
know there's the approach that we expect
and<00:04:42.190> then<00:04:42.280> there's<00:04:42.430> what<00:04:42.610> they<00:04:42.699> actually<00:04:42.880> do

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
and then there's what they actually do

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.810 
and then there's what they actually do
so<00:04:43.509> it's<00:04:43.930> fishman<00:04:44.680> you'll<00:04:45.310> be<00:04:45.400> very<00:04:45.550> different

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
so it's fishman you'll be very different

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.999 
so it's fishman you'll be very different
