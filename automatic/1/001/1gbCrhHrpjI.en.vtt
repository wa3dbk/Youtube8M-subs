00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.490
 we are going to carry out a revision to a 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.620
 smartphone Huawei ideos pro the model is 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.690
 the 83 50 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.610
 As a first step we will find a 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.529
 full qwerty keyboard very generous very 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.119
 comfortable really is to the truth that to me 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.040
 I really liked the comfort of 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.390
 keyboard we have a trackback the buttons 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.989
 classic and also has a screen 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.149
 capacitive 2.6 inches at 320 x 240 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:30.040
 the operating system that governs it is 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:31.509
 an android 2.2 froyo is a system 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.250
 operative that no longer has at least 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:34.570
 in this phone more update is 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.360
 say that he's going to stay with the frob me 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.590
 it's a low-mid-range phone but 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.670
 they have some benefits that the truth 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.340
 that are worth keeping in mind 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.110
 when one wants to spend little money 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.900
 all its structure this part this 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.300
 metal you start quite strong is 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.520
 robust the phone we have a camera 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.170
 no flash led 3.2 megapixels a 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.810
 speaker milestone that sounds very loud 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.370
 by the way the cover here of plastic type 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.340
 rubber with that painting that puts you 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.680
 usually I put out the good chip 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.239
 this is a sampler is not what always 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.360
 they send us is a samper has 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:10.510
 to put a memory and here 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:14.520
 we have this the classic tele sim 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:18.340
 this is so from the first point no 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.310
 we have volume to go up and down 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.140
 what is the 3.5 earphone the micro 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.179
 usb to be able to connect and the ignition 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.250
 the team that is the most basic thing 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:29.560
 It has the same buttons or the 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.329
 basic buttons to use it and 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.950
 can go back to the places good the 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:34.750
 home directly that sends us to the hall 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.329
 where are we the applications that 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.219
 we have installed we have several 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:41.590
 options is completely compatible with 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:43.810
 all that is android applications 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.340
 is available the camera is 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.350
 pretty fast even though we 're 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.909
 talking the 3.2 megapixel camera a 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.670
 camera that we say works pretty 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.319
 well take pictures pretty fast do not be 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.789
 we have seen this is directly the 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:56.590
 we see there now we are not taking anything 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:58.569
 specific but not good the options of 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.819
 share the classic android if 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:03.239
 we talk in memory we are seeing that 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:05.649
 has a memory of 256 megabytes of ram 

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:07.179
 a flash memory to be able to install 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.539
 applications and all that kind of stuff from 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:12.849
 512 mb is not a phone say range 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.590
 medium-low as I said 112 grams is 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.120
 a pretty light phone for the 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.280
 dimensions that it has and for the 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.420
 benefits the camera with is the truth 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.519
 that I was testing the camera and 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.620
 let's say it's not bad or it's the truth that 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.420
 you can take pictures this one 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.549
 nice or the phone answers 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.379
 very very quickly that is, we do not have 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.970
 a lot of trouble or we can move the 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:33.010
 applications without a problem this is 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.290
 Well, look, it's the whole part 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.430
 touch is not we can this configure 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.290
 the whole tactical part we can work 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.430
 from one side or the other no or we can 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.590
 work with the qwerty keyboard 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.140
 directly or directly with what 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.400
 it would be with the tactile part when 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.709
 work we are not doing for 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.920
 electronic the sound is very good or 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.569
 we do not have this bad sound not good 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.640
 Here we have this several options for 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.069
 be able to update good this type things 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.319
 if they are fixed in the equipment it works 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.390
 pretty fast or be the google play 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.670
 is updated towards last 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.250
 latest version with which we will have 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.349
 this applications that are supported 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.540
 by fabio this is not something that is like this 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:13.349
 the speaker milestone to be able to listen there 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.180
 the microphone down there 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:18.010
