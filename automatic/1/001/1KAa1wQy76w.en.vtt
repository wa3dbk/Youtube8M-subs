00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 and that at the July meeting touch tsb and 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.680
 first I have that involved the crops 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.590
 with the snipe I believe that truth the l11 I asked 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.259
 it's called the lr-115 and obviously it meets 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.000
 it's not mine enough that the channel of the 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.920
 person who belong to him gameplay in the 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.840
 of scripting but if this is the fence 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.820
 with what I'm going to talk about when it's 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.580
 so many people are talking not 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.320
 goes to belkis cop in crops and but you 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.980
 can teach interviews of the person 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.980
 who gave that 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:35.420
 wyss conversations filled 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.420
 per se 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.140
 and that's what made it not formed 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.090
 I know how on twitter it was that it started 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.590
 everyone complaining and I like that 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.080
 I had not seen the unit interviÃº 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.730
 but that kind of name is marc up or 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.380
 something like that and if you're one of those who 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.810
 be involved with the game I do not know what 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:10.570
 specifically does but he said he does not 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.710
 was the quiz cob in codes and 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.010
 honestly what I think is that it's going 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.180
 to be more difficult this here this guy what 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.850
 that is without leaving copying all the 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.860
 time but if this one is going to be more 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.270
 difficult to me obviously added annoying 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.400
 the program is that if you are going to 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.350
 bother that is imagined for the 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.930
 pits will be much harder at least 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.180
 that take out a collateral gum Tripoli this 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.270
 your end will not be there all the time 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.190
 cooked is the fary is going to be much 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.430
 more difficult as I said 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:42.610
 and you do not know the one that is not going to be like 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.530
 now that as we have now easy that 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.930
 well so I like that I can 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.310
 be easily soft and with earth is 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.130
 easy now and I can not do it well 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.890
 this force touch to remove it imagine 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.620
 with you that is there every 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.780
 kilo that is perfect to the miles or that 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.160
 be this a tail they give you a triple but 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.570
 it does not know how many people 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.520
 I was complaining about if I wanted to be the 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.460
 you view this does care 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.710
 this because I like this a clan and 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.540
 this one should really saga eclipse ' this 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.190
 will affect me because I want everyone 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.070
 click but I'll be more focused 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.400
 in gameplays like that and I'm behind and that's it 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.660
 but maybe this sniper is nothing else 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.060
 I know why that what we have seen 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.310
 now because with the l11 have never been 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.230
 could do as that clues and clear well 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.090
 that are left not knowing that you know that 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.520
 and nobody basically gives everything that they 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.440
 I wanted to talk is going up fire and the 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.150
 top digestion have seen survivors 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.190
 that there was a hotel because it was up 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.630
 well late at night for nothing because 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.490
 he liked it contracted like 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.989
 subscribe has been done I still have a 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.100
 facebook internet description this
