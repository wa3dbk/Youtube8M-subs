00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.449 
again my battered heart swells I
remember<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.930> joys<00:02:28.260> I<00:02:28.590> remember<00:02:29.099> the<00:02:29.220> pain

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
remember the joys I remember the pain

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.750 
remember the joys I remember the pain
and<00:02:29.819> I'm<00:02:30.510> loving<00:02:30.959> and<00:02:31.170> living<00:02:31.470> life<00:02:32.190> over

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
and I'm loving and living life over

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.130 
and I'm loving and living life over
again<00:02:32.909> I<00:02:34.549> think<00:02:35.549> of<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.849> years<00:02:36.150> all<00:02:36.510> too<00:02:36.870> few

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
again I think of the years all too few

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.250 
again I think of the years all too few
gone<00:02:37.409> so<00:02:37.680> fast<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.430> accept<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.629> stark<00:02:39.930> fact

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
gone so fast and accept the stark fact

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
gone so fast and accept the stark fact
that<00:02:40.890> nothing<00:02:41.430> can<00:02:41.700> last<00:02:42.260> so<00:02:43.260> open<00:02:43.829> your<00:02:43.980> eyes

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
that nothing can last so open your eyes

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.000 
that nothing can last so open your eyes
nurse<00:02:44.700> open<00:02:45.269> and<00:02:45.450> see<00:02:45.750> not<00:02:46.410> a<00:02:46.440> crabby<00:02:46.890> old

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
nurse open and see not a crabby old

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.710 
nurse open and see not a crabby old
woman<00:02:47.609> look<00:02:48.090> closer

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
woman look closer

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.190 
woman look closer
see<00:02:49.349> me
