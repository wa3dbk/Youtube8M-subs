The Kindle4 is the new e-book reader by Amazon, and it's the product we're going to talk about today, for netbooknews.it.

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:16.279
Compared with the Kindle3, the big news that you have surely seen, is the lack of the QWERTY

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.460
keyboard here on the lower edge, replaced with this directional pad and this four side buttons.

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.859
The keyboard is on-screen, it appears pushing this button and can be controlled by the pad itself,

00:00:28.709 --> 00:00:32.709
in this way; if you hold the button down, you can run through the letters more quickly.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.489
Without the physical keyboard, the new Kindle weighs only 170 grams, that is the 30% less

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:44.369
than the previous model and it's the 20% thinner, it's easy to handle considering the compact dimensions.

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.109
Although the low price, this device has good technical specs and a good construction quality

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:55.109
too, it's firm and the materials are well refined.

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.610
The shade of color marry beautifully with the grey-tones of the screen, it is made to

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.189
be anti-glare and allows to read without eye strain.

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:11.729
Among the technical specs, there are: the 2 Gb hard disk, but actually you have 1.3 Gb left for books and contents;

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.789
the Wi-Fi connectivity, you can see the little icon up here;

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:22.030
the battery life, that according to Amazon

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.990
lasts about one month. I didn't tested it for so long but in one week the discharge

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.090
has been about the 25%, so I can say that the valuation of the manufacturer is reasonable.

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:36.560
The package includes exactly what you see here, really minimal: the only “extra”,

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:43.560
of course besides the e-book reader, is the micro USB cable, used to connect the Kindle4

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.030
to the computer and charge it. It lacks the battery charger for the wall

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.030
socket, but you can find it in the Amazon shop at the small price of 10 dollars.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.690
The format are those usually supported by the Amazon products, among which .txt, .pdf,

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.459
.mobi and .PRC , and some others using the converter made available by the company itself.

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:11.950
There are no speakers or headphone jacks, so we don't have audio features and we cannot listen to audio-books.

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:18.220
At the first start, we've been asked to connect the Kindle to the Wi-Fi and download our own

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.470
Amazon library, if we have one, or to buy contents using the search function included.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:29.470
The strong points that come out in the daily use are the battery, the screen and the lightness

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.769
of the whole device.

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.799
The Kindle4 it's easy to handle, I can hold it between my thumb and forefinger; well I

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:42.799
have big hands but many people, I think, can hold the device in this way, without touching

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:51.420
the two buttons below used to turn pages, on both sides.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.049
The button to move forward in the pages is bigger, because it's more used.

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:02.860
These buttons are made to not turn over pages unintentionally: if I push it here, it happens

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:12.299
nothing; to make it work I have to push it a little down.

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:17.969
The Ink Pearl screen it's a 6 inch with a resolution of 600x800 pixel; it does a complete

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:23.230
refresh every six pages, but it's a setting that can be changed in the menu, using the

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.280
new firmware. 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.760
With pdf files, on the other hand, the complete refresh happens every page.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.530
According to the experts, talking about e-book readers, the contrast of this new screen

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.819
is lower than that used in the previous Kindle model, but however the reading quality is very high.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.829
There are some personal settings, in fact the size of the scripts (with a real-time

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:56.730
preview) can be modified, as well as the font type, the line-spacing and the border spaces,

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:07.379
using this option “words per row”. Of course, you can also set the rotation to read horizontally.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.329
Talking about the battery capacity, the screen saver disables the Wi-Fi signal, so it saves

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:15.670
much more battery life.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.850
Personally, I didn't find too much annoying the advertising, on the contrary these images

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:27.140
can be seen in a particular and different way on this e-Ink screen.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:34.140
Let's wait to see if it's better to buy this Kindle4 right now, spending 79 dollars, or

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.780
wait for the new touch-screen version out, that for only 20 dollars more will give you

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.600
a great touch graphic interface, audio features, more space on the hard disk, 4 Gb instead

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.190
of 2 Gb, and the 3G internet connectivity if you want.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:52.180
Anyway, I feel I can recommend you this Kindle4, maybe for people who already have a more advanced

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:58.070
e-book reader or to make a beautiful Christmas gift, at this time of year it will be perfect!

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.840
For further technical considerations, I recommend you to read the article, of which you can
