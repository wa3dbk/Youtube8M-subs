the<00:02:41.849> professor's<00:02:42.840> can<00:02:43.080> just<00:02:43.290> whip<00:02:43.440> out<00:02:43.590> this

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
the professor's can just whip out this

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.110 
the professor's can just whip out this

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
and you know hide behind it you know

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.949 
and you know hide behind it you know
like<00:02:48.299> this<00:02:52.640> you<00:02:53.640> know<00:02:53.760> because<00:02:54.030> if<00:02:54.510> they<00:02:54.720> have

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
like this you know because if they have

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.050 
like this you know because if they have
it<00:02:54.989> it<00:02:55.500> would<00:02:55.680> probably<00:02:55.950> be<00:02:56.340> a<00:02:56.579> lot<00:02:56.790> easier

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
it it would probably be a lot easier

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.780 
it it would probably be a lot easier
than<00:02:57.390> whipping<00:02:57.900> around<00:02:58.019> a<00:02:58.590> huge<00:02:59.010> board<00:02:59.370> you

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
than whipping around a huge board you

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:00.710

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
know because that might be a little

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.509 
know because that might be a little
cumbersome<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:01.319> you<00:03:01.980> know<00:03:02.099> you<00:03:02.160> could<00:03:02.370> just

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
cumbersome and you know you could just

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:03.860 
cumbersome and you know you could just
have<00:03:02.670> this<00:03:02.819> on<00:03:03.030> your<00:03:03.150> desk<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:03.540> you<00:03:03.629> see<00:03:03.840> like
