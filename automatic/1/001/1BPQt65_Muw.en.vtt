00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.149
 the gas turbines are going on for the project 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:26.529
 was and today we are just about the 

00:00:22.149 --> 00:00:29.140
 loads on the screen 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.130
 This gas turbine is currently 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.200
 most powerful gas turbine the Siemens 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.000
 It is offered in the geo de process 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.280
 an efficiency of over 61 percent 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.399
 reach and the city of düsseldorf 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.320
 there will still be a district heating supply 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.780
 then we lie in this process 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.060
 at over 85 percent efficiency around that 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.320
 is world record 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.750
 our machine is about now 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.440
 one and a half meters high here around this 450 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.720
 metric tons 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.610
 there comes a special transport i 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.280
 put it a vehicle with many 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.470
 is is what axes found even the 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.760
 machine deposed and is because of the 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.230
 great distance to ours 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.230
 lagging behind 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.900
 The foot must be at a certain distance 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:22.940
 is walking by foot is different 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:25.070
 but then follow exactly here eg 41 cm and 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.140
 he has that over there and he has one 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.460
 tolerance of about centimeters though the 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.970
 can get stuck outside the flight 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:35.440
 important issues is that 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.440
 the carrier to cope with no problems 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:45.200
 to steer and steer is also 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.600
 not so easy to kick if we too 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.759
 other district water why have something 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:54.680
 everything so it's all a vague thing 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:56.150
 and then go the charge will be 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.150
 is then carried out again 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:02.210
 with checked if you have secured 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:05.259
 we 'll get the evening of siemens then 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.259
 it starts on the street 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.060
 the vehicle driving without crane and smite 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.900
 right on the ship with this turbine 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.370
 almost 500 tons and the road vehicle 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.590
 enter the ramp in the 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.180
 special ship that too 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.280
 has ramps and sloping constructions 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.780
 Red Rain found this turbine 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.640
 attention no longer straightens 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:46.459
 transport and we had to get one 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.459
 consider completely new transport concept 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.550
 the channel is just so far from the 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.240
 Water depth of the British gold rides 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:58.970
 that we have to deal with all tricks here 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.440
 lock locks that the lock 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.840
 does not drain any water and such things 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:08.150
 that we get through here that's them 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:10.400
 on channel the first bridge the beads 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.990
 bridge it very low which means there 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.910
 we need a corresponding amount of water in 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.710
 the ballast tanks bring us down 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.780
 This bridge with the high fix of height 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.830
 come through the next bridge is the 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.390
 eisenbahnbrücke 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.650
 we do not have that with the bridge 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.610
 problem because we have a very small one 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.080
 water depth 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.630
 that means we have to go between them 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.370
 Both bridge the complete water 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.110
 we can get the ship out of it 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.450
 come up high and with one 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.890
 his hand flat and then fell 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.870
 come under this bridge 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.950
 if you then the water and canal 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.950
 everything is fine 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.190
 here with these transport it of course 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.380
 to pay attention 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.600
 For the first time , so that the view 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.330
 naturally limited by the height 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.190
 of the product I really have to be there 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.459
 already on what radio from 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:58.550
 comes up front because I say tight pass 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:01.510
 Do not haul bridges encounters 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:04.760
 alone can see everything 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.709
 this will be difficult and then 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.540
 Do you take the bridges through heights 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.570
 because they are all different and 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.450
 Of course you have to pay attention to that 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:17.419
 which podcast now before her ear is 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:21.830
 it really spread internationally 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:23.639
 clearly say so professional and not 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:27.419
 Chancellor can do me 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:29.879
 but it is as easy as you can imagine 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:31.199
 then the hairdresser misjudges the professional 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:34.370
 sometimes even cut off one ear 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:34.370
 but everything can happen
