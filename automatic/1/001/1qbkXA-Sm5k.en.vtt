00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
very beginning which i'm sure this set

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.690 
very beginning which i'm sure this set
is<00:01:50.820> originally<00:01:51.360> meant<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.960> represent<00:01:52.700> but

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
it's still nice to have its own

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.459 
it's still nice to have its own
interpretation<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.610> there<00:01:57.329> we've<00:01:57.540> got<00:01:57.570> more

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.200 
we can see his wind flaps and yeah now
another<00:05:33.170> nice<00:05:33.440> detail<00:05:33.920> that<00:05:34.280> comes<00:05:34.520> with<00:05:34.760> Loki

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
another nice detail that comes with Loki

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.520 
another nice detail that comes with Loki
himself<00:05:35.960> is<00:05:36.290> the<00:05:36.830> Cosmic<00:05:37.820> Cube<00:05:38.390> now<00:05:39.020> if<00:05:39.260> you've

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
himself is the Cosmic Cube now if you've

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.500 
himself is the Cosmic Cube now if you've
seen<00:05:39.710> the<00:05:39.830> movie<00:05:39.860> you<00:05:40.190> know<00:05:40.220> that<00:05:40.610> the<00:05:41.210> device

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
seen the movie you know that the device

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.140 
seen the movie you know that the device
in<00:05:41.840> the<00:05:42.350> movie<00:05:42.620> is<00:05:42.800> not<00:05:43.190> called<00:05:43.520> a<00:05:43.610> cosmic<00:05:43.790> cube

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
in the movie is not called a cosmic cube

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.110 
in the movie is not called a cosmic cube
it's<00:05:44.480> called<00:05:44.900> the<00:05:45.290> tesseract<00:05:45.890> but<00:05:46.460> in<00:05:46.730> the

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
it's called the tesseract but in the

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.060 
it's called the tesseract but in the
comic<00:05:47.480> book<00:05:47.690> series<00:05:47.960> it<00:05:48.350> is<00:05:48.380> referred<00:05:48.800> to<00:05:48.830> as<00:05:48.950> a

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.070 
comic book series it is referred to as a

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.370 
comic book series it is referred to as a
cosmic<00:05:49.610> cube<00:05:49.820> and<00:05:50.510> a<00:05:50.630> whole<00:05:50.930> bunch<00:05:50.960> of

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380 
cosmic cube and a whole bunch of

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.710 
cosmic cube and a whole bunch of
continuities<00:05:51.980> so<00:05:52.790> this<00:05:53.030> is<00:05:53.180> a<00:05:53.210> nice<00:05:53.450> throwback

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 
continuities so this is a nice throwback

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.840 
continuities so this is a nice throwback
to<00:05:54.110> the<00:05:54.140> comic<00:05:54.620> book<00:05:54.650> series<00:05:55.070> now<00:05:55.550> for<00:05:55.730> those

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:55.850 
to the comic book series now for those

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.960 
to the comic book series now for those
of<00:05:55.910> you<00:05:56.060> that<00:05:56.210> don't<00:05:56.390> know<00:05:57.490> what<00:05:58.490> a<00:05:58.520> tesseract

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:58.970 
of you that don't know what a tesseract

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.870 
of you that don't know what a tesseract
is<00:05:59.420> there<00:05:59.840> is<00:06:00.020> such<00:06:00.530> a<00:06:00.560> thing<00:06:00.680> as<00:06:01.100> a<00:06:01.190> tesseract

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:01.880 
is there is such a thing as a tesseract

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.510 
is there is such a thing as a tesseract
it<00:06:02.390> is<00:06:02.600> something<00:06:02.930> grounded<00:06:03.650> in<00:06:03.800> science

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 
it is something grounded in science

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.450 
it is something grounded in science
basically<00:06:05.360> what<00:06:05.630> a<00:06:05.660> tesseract<00:06:06.080> is<00:06:06.530> is<00:06:07.010> an

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460 
basically what a tesseract is is an

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.940 
basically what a tesseract is is an
eight-sided<00:06:08.050> q<00:06:09.050> kind<00:06:09.380> of<00:06:09.440> hard<00:06:09.590> to<00:06:09.620> imagine

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:09.950 
eight-sided q kind of hard to imagine

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.730 
eight-sided q kind of hard to imagine
but<00:06:10.340> imagine<00:06:11.240> a<00:06:11.360> cube<00:06:11.690> within<00:06:11.990> a<00:06:12.200> cue<00:06:12.560> that's

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 
but imagine a cube within a cue that's

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.500 
but imagine a cube within a cue that's
connected<00:06:13.160> at<00:06:13.280> all<00:06:13.310> corners<00:06:13.880> which<00:06:14.210> is<00:06:14.330> sort

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:14.510 
connected at all corners which is sort

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:15.610 
connected at all corners which is sort
of<00:06:14.570> fundamentally<00:06:15.170> a<00:06:15.200> great<00:06:15.440> way<00:06:15.560> to

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:15.620 
of fundamentally a great way to

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.400 
of fundamentally a great way to
represent<00:06:15.860> a<00:06:16.360> multiverse<00:06:17.360> and<00:06:17.630> the<00:06:18.020> Chitauri

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:18.410 
represent a multiverse and the Chitauri

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.560 
represent a multiverse and the Chitauri
