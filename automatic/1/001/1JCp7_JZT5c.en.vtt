00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
tank is really don't want to drill

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.400 
tank is really don't want to drill
through<00:04:00.580> and<00:04:00.790> hit<00:04:01.060> the<00:04:01.150> gas<00:04:01.270> tank<00:04:01.600> cause<00:04:02.260> the

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
through and hit the gas tank cause the

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.410 
through and hit the gas tank cause the
spark<00:04:02.650> blow<00:04:02.920> up<00:04:02.980> the<00:04:03.070> car<00:04:03.280> you<00:04:03.940> know<00:04:04.060> have<00:04:04.390> a

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
spark blow up the car you know have a

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.090 
spark blow up the car you know have a
leaky<00:04:04.750> gas<00:04:04.900> tank<00:04:05.170> for<00:04:05.290> months<00:04:05.560> now<00:04:05.680> we<00:04:05.739> know<00:04:05.950> it

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
leaky gas tank for months now we know it

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.680 
leaky gas tank for months now we know it
so<00:04:06.640> it's<00:04:06.820> something<00:04:06.940> you<00:04:07.060> really<00:04:07.450> want<00:04:07.630> to

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
so it's something you really want to

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.870 
so it's something you really want to
watch<00:04:07.840> for<00:04:08.170> before<00:04:08.560> drilling<00:04:08.890> anywhere<00:04:09.640> into

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
watch for before drilling anywhere into

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.470 
watch for before drilling anywhere into
the<00:04:10.000> trunk<00:04:10.180> of<00:04:10.330> the<00:04:10.390> vehicle<00:04:10.620> on<00:04:11.620> any<00:04:11.830> vehicle

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.110 

[Music]

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
[Music]

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.670 
[Music]
so<00:04:19.120> what<00:04:19.630> we<00:04:19.750> went<00:04:19.900> ahead<00:04:19.989> and<00:04:20.229> did<00:04:20.320> we<00:04:20.530> went

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
so what we went ahead and did we went

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.200 
so what we went ahead and did we went
ahead<00:04:20.739> and<00:04:20.979> mounted<00:04:21.489> the<00:04:21.609> amplifier<00:04:22.000> to<00:04:22.030> the

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
ahead and mounted the amplifier to the

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.430 
ahead and mounted the amplifier to the
back<00:04:22.390> of<00:04:22.540> the<00:04:22.600> seat<00:04:22.840> was<00:04:23.020> really<00:04:23.290> no<00:04:23.410> other

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
back of the seat was really no other

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.200 
back of the seat was really no other
locations<00:04:24.100> within<00:04:24.250> the<00:04:24.370> vehicle<00:04:24.640> to<00:04:24.940> mount<00:04:25.090> it

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
locations within the vehicle to mount it

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.300 
locations within the vehicle to mount it
without<00:04:26.080> making<00:04:26.440> anything<00:04:26.620> like<00:04:26.890> a<00:04:26.919> custom

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
without making anything like a custom

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.120 
without making anything like a custom
template<00:04:27.910> or<00:04:28.090> mounting<00:04:28.600> surface<00:04:29.140> so<00:04:30.070> I'm

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
template or mounting surface so I'm

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.170 
template or mounting surface so I'm
going<00:04:30.250> ahead<00:04:30.310> and<00:04:30.490> mounted<00:04:30.669> it<00:04:30.790> to<00:04:30.820> the<00:04:31.030> back

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
going ahead and mounted it to the back

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.719 
going ahead and mounted it to the back
of<00:04:31.330> the<00:04:31.390> seat<00:04:31.600> here<00:04:31.870> which<00:04:32.590> is<00:04:32.680> okay<00:04:33.040> there's

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
of the seat here which is okay there's

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:34.800 
of the seat here which is okay there's
no<00:04:33.880> room<00:04:34.030> underneath<00:04:34.240> the<00:04:34.330> passenger<00:04:34.780> or

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
no room underneath the passenger or

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.810 
no room underneath the passenger or
driver<00:04:34.900> and<00:04:35.710> this<00:04:35.830> is<00:04:35.950> my<00:04:36.070> sub<00:04:36.280> wire<00:04:36.520> here

about<00:04:37.240> to<00:04:37.330> wire<00:04:37.479> up<00:04:37.630> the<00:04:37.690> subwoofers<00:04:38.020> and<00:04:38.320> show

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
about to wire up the subwoofers and show

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.110 
about to wire up the subwoofers and show
you<00:04:38.530> guys<00:04:38.740> how<00:04:38.919> to<00:04:38.950> basically<00:04:39.940> why<00:04:40.060> the

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
you guys how to basically why the

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.820 
you guys how to basically why the
subwoofers<00:04:40.540> in<00:04:40.840> parallel<00:04:41.200> to<00:04:41.470> get<00:04:41.590> a<00:04:41.620> final

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
subwoofers in parallel to get a final

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.710 
subwoofers in parallel to get a final
impedance<00:04:42.220> of<00:04:42.280> 2<00:04:42.460> ohms<00:04:42.640> alright<00:04:43.450> so<00:04:43.600> we're

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
impedance of 2 ohms alright so we're

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.060 
impedance of 2 ohms alright so we're
going<00:04:43.840> to<00:04:43.900> do<00:04:44.020> here<00:04:44.229> is<00:04:44.320> show<00:04:44.350> you<00:04:44.560> how<00:04:44.740> to<00:04:44.800> wire

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
going to do here is show you how to wire

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.580 
going to do here is show you how to wire
to<00:04:45.460> single<00:04:45.850> form<00:04:46.090> subwoofers<00:04:46.630> to<00:04:47.110> a<00:04:47.140> final

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
to single form subwoofers to a final

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.190 
to single form subwoofers to a final
impedance<00:04:48.040> of<00:04:48.130> 2<00:04:48.340> ohms<00:04:48.660> what<00:04:49.660> I've<00:04:49.780> done<00:04:49.930> here

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
impedance of 2 ohms what I've done here

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.719 
impedance of 2 ohms what I've done here
instead<00:04:50.500> of<00:04:50.560> utilizing<00:04:51.130> the<00:04:51.190> terminals<00:04:51.610> on
