harpoon into the rubber stopper in order

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.120 
harpoon into the rubber stopper in order
to<00:00:52.000> do<00:00:52.180> the<00:00:52.330> proper<00:00:52.620> aspiration<00:00:53.620> prior<00:00:53.890> to

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.130 
to do the proper aspiration prior to

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.670 
to do the proper aspiration prior to
injection<00:00:54.750> next<00:00:55.750> we<00:00:55.870> will<00:00:56.020> place<00:00:56.230> the<00:00:56.440> needle

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
injection next we will place the needle

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.540 
injection next we will place the needle
onto<00:00:57.520> the<00:00:57.820> syringe<00:00:58.290> being<00:00:59.290> careful<00:00:59.800> to<00:01:00.280> place

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
onto the syringe being careful to place

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.390 
onto the syringe being careful to place
the<00:01:00.910> needle<00:01:01.240> as<00:01:01.810> concentric<00:01:02.530> ly<00:01:02.680> as<00:01:02.800> possible

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 
the needle as concentric ly as possible

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.359 
the needle as concentric ly as possible
into<00:01:03.760> the<00:01:03.790> needle<00:01:04.180> adapter<00:01:04.689> thereby<00:01:05.680> reducing

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
into the needle adapter thereby reducing

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.169 
into the needle adapter thereby reducing
the<00:01:06.520> risk<00:01:06.759> and<00:01:07.450> the<00:01:07.539> possibility<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:09.179> leakage

00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:10.179 
the risk and the possibility of leakage

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:14.190 
the risk and the possibility of leakage
of<00:01:10.829> anesthetic<00:01:11.829> as<00:01:12.060> we're<00:01:13.060> injecting<00:01:13.899> the

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
of anesthetic as we're injecting the

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.219 
of anesthetic as we're injecting the
solution<00:01:14.710> at<00:01:14.979> the<00:01:15.130> target<00:01:15.490> site

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.760 

so<00:01:20.009> there<00:01:20.219> we<00:01:20.399> have<00:01:20.659> properly<00:01:21.659> placed

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
so there we have properly placed

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.590 
so there we have properly placed
needle<00:01:23.159> cartridge<00:01:23.610> into<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.000> syringe<00:01:24.420> and

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
needle cartridge into the syringe and

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.319 
needle cartridge into the syringe and
now<00:01:24.810> we<00:01:24.869> are<00:01:25.079> ready<00:01:25.289> except<00:01:26.280> for<00:01:26.549> placement

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:27.329 
now we are ready except for placement

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:30.169 
now we are ready except for placement
onto<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.170> protector<00:01:28.770> which<00:01:29.520> will<00:01:29.700> enable<00:01:29.909> us

00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:30.179 
onto the protector which will enable us

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:39.350 
onto the protector which will enable us
to<00:01:30.240> work<00:01:31.490> carefully<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:33.649> the<00:01:38.240> recapping<00:01:39.240> of

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
to work carefully to the recapping of

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.950 
to work carefully to the recapping of
the<00:01:39.420> needle<00:01:39.689> following<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.229> injection<00:01:41.960> okay

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
the needle following the injection okay

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.319 
the needle following the injection okay
what<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.590> see<00:01:43.799> here<00:01:44.039> is<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.579> properly<00:01:45.000> set<00:01:45.299> up

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
what you see here is the properly set up

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.039 
what you see here is the properly set up
tray<00:01:45.719> which<00:01:46.159> should<00:01:47.159> be<00:01:47.340> on<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.789> back<00:01:48.060> on<00:01:48.450> the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
tray which should be on the back on the

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.949 
tray which should be on the back on the
mobile<00:01:49.229> cabinet<00:01:50.090> what<00:01:51.090> we've<00:01:51.270> presented<00:01:51.539> here

00:01:51.949 --> 00:01:51.959 
mobile cabinet what we've presented here

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:55.760 
mobile cabinet what we've presented here
is<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.590> syringe<00:01:53.310> properly<00:01:53.849> set<00:01:54.539> to<00:01:54.659> go<00:01:54.840> with

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
is the syringe properly set to go with

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.330 
is the syringe properly set to go with
the<00:01:56.340> additional<00:01:56.819> armamentarium<00:01:58.340> topical

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
the additional armamentarium topical

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.809 
the additional armamentarium topical
anesthetic<00:01:59.849> as<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.119> can<00:02:00.299> see<00:02:01.399> two<00:02:02.399> by<00:02:02.549> twos

00:02:02.809 --> 00:02:02.819 
anesthetic as you can see two by twos

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:07.069 
anesthetic as you can see two by twos
and<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.750> few<00:02:04.369> cut<00:02:05.369> tip<00:02:05.579> applicators<00:02:06.179> as<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.899> can

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
and a few cut tip applicators as you can

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.529 
and a few cut tip applicators as you can
see<00:02:07.289> here<00:02:07.530> this<00:02:07.739> is<00:02:07.920> probably<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:09.060> maximum

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
see here this is probably the maximum

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.390 
see here this is probably the maximum
amount<00:02:09.959> of<00:02:10.140> topical<00:02:10.560> anesthetic<00:02:11.130> you<00:02:11.250> will

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
amount of topical anesthetic you will

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.210 
amount of topical anesthetic you will
need<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:12.170> always<00:02:13.170> remember<00:02:13.650> that<00:02:13.680> we

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
need and always remember that we

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.280 
need and always remember that we
probably<00:02:14.849> always<00:02:15.060> apply<00:02:15.569> more<00:02:15.840> topical

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
probably always apply more topical

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.949 
probably always apply more topical
anesthetic<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:17.040> we<00:02:17.250> need<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.640> so<00:02:18.000> by<00:02:18.569> no<00:02:18.630> means

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
anesthetic and we need to so by no means

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.470 
anesthetic and we need to so by no means
do<00:02:19.170> we<00:02:19.290> use<00:02:19.500> this<00:02:19.739> all<00:02:20.010> on<00:02:20.400> one<00:02:20.670> particular

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
do we use this all on one particular

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.420 
do we use this all on one particular
injection<00:02:22.049> this<00:02:22.890> should<00:02:23.040> suffice<00:02:23.190> for

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
injection this should suffice for

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.710 
injection this should suffice for
probably<00:02:24.000> three<00:02:24.530> injections<00:02:26.450> we're<00:02:27.450> going<00:02:27.600> to

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
probably three injections we're going to

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.180 
probably three injections we're going to
demonstrate<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.380> appropriate<00:02:28.980> way<00:02:29.160> to

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
demonstrate the appropriate way to

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.280 
demonstrate the appropriate way to
approach<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:30.060> patient<00:02:30.239> with<00:02:30.660> your<00:02:30.810> unpacked
