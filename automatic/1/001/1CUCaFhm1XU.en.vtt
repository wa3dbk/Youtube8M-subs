 series between 3,000 and 7,000 which is the case 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:30.310
 we take them 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.310

 who chooses on the screen 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:53.610
 the width 24 inches in this state in 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:56.260
 this box we choose the type of paper 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.350
 let's make an impression of 600 in 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:03.240
 this case always in millimeters 600 x 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.949
 450 with stakes are twice 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.430
 okay 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.170
 and if it's paper roll here is the 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.740
 option to choose paper or roll that is 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.740
 I need 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.280
 here in none of these options is 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.860
 work is already all outlined here in 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.660
 utilities you can do in here what 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.970
 this director is cleaning injectors 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.830
 head alignment what in and almost 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.070
 in that case in this case simply 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.260
 we love that lends the main screen 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.880
 we choose at the speed 720 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.590
 positively is the fastest that 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.420
 and it has already depending on the 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.150
 printing features are 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:44.780
 They can choose different types posters 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.310
 from black to color what in this case in 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.230
 this case we are going for a decision 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.560
 let's look at how we are doing with the 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.300
 always print in this case I like 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.100
 what 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.100
 on the road a team this 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.790
 and always have to for color 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.190
 graphic diagram whatever it takes 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.560
 the preview client of 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:12.350
 printing is a way of how here the 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:15.160
 impression then let's accept 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.160
 and intimate 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.769
 already passes the impression happens to float of 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.319
 print we hope the window will come out 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.020
 of 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.510
 of impression 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.840
 here is in the back 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.099
 this is the preview window 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:37.250
 let's say everything is printed that are 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:37.250
 Waiting mirrors and print 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.680
 in this case we owe what is called 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.680
 Continued installed for sublimation 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.660
