has got the charging circuitry inside
the<00:00:40.290> device<00:00:40.610> what<00:00:41.610> this<00:00:41.730> means<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.180> you

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
the device what this means is that you

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.569 
the device what this means is that you
can<00:00:42.540> charge<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:43.020> up<00:00:43.200> using<00:00:43.710> any<00:00:43.980> pedal<00:00:44.399> power

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
can charge it up using any pedal power

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.819 
can charge it up using any pedal power
supply<00:00:44.940> just<00:00:45.270> like<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.840> once<00:00:46.200> model<00:00:46.590> something

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
supply just like a once model something

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.400 
supply just like a once model something
like<00:00:46.950> their<00:00:47.129> daisy<00:00:47.399> chain<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.260> charge<00:00:49.260> it

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
like their daisy chain and charge it

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.380 
like their daisy chain and charge it
overnight<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:50.039> then<00:00:50.910> they'll<00:00:51.030> have<00:00:51.180> enough

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
overnight and then they'll have enough

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.020 
overnight and then they'll have enough
power<00:00:51.660> in<00:00:52.230> each<00:00:52.469> cell<00:00:52.800> for<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.430> week<00:00:53.670> or<00:00:53.820> twos

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030

each<00:00:57.180> pedal<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.629> housed<00:00:58.440> in<00:00:58.620> our<00:00:58.739> proprietary

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
each pedal is housed in our proprietary

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.240 
each pedal is housed in our proprietary
die<00:00:59.640> cast<00:00:59.969> aluminum<00:01:00.620> enclosure

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.520 
die cast aluminum enclosure
which<00:01:03.120> basically<00:01:03.300> allows<00:01:04.110> us<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.379> have<00:01:04.470> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
which basically allows us to have the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.130 
which basically allows us to have the
sockets<00:01:05.040> on<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.670> end<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.600> they're<00:01:06.810> very<00:01:06.840> very

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
sockets on the end so they're very very

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.230 
sockets on the end so they're very very
small<00:01:07.409> very<00:01:07.740> small<00:01:08.040> footprint<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.060> allows

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
small very small footprint and it allows

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.840 
small very small footprint and it allows
you<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.420> slip<00:01:09.869> them<00:01:09.990> into<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.260> pedal<00:01:11.040> board<00:01:11.189> you

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
you to slip them into a pedal board you

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.010 
you to slip them into a pedal board you
need<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.030> little<00:01:12.150> bit<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.680> fuzz<00:01:13.680> or<00:01:13.979> compression

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
need a little bit of fuzz or compression

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.320 
need a little bit of fuzz or compression
overdrive<00:01:16.020> distortion<00:01:16.470> delay<00:01:17.000> tremolo<00:01:18.000> or

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
overdrive distortion delay tremolo or

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.039 
overdrive distortion delay tremolo or
boost<00:01:19.460> so<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.580> sound<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:21.000> them<00:01:21.119> first<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.930> all

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
boost so the sound of them first of all

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.050 
boost so the sound of them first of all
I'll<00:01:22.140> show<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:22.560> one<00:01:22.619> this<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:22.979> Ruby<00:01:23.430> this

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
I'll show you this one this is Ruby this

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:41.969 
I'll show you this one this is Ruby this
is<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.360> fuzz<00:01:24.570> pedal

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.149 

so<00:01:42.979> it's<00:01:43.130> a<00:01:43.189> nice<00:01:43.369> smooth<00:01:44.090> silicon<00:01:44.659> fuzz<00:01:45.159> we've

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
so it's a nice smooth silicon fuzz we've

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:56.560 
so it's a nice smooth silicon fuzz we've
got<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:46.490> grace<00:01:46.729> which<00:01:47.030> is<00:01:47.060> the<00:01:47.270> compressor

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.850 

we've<00:01:57.570> got<00:01:57.690> Scala<00:01:58.020> which<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.470> overdrive

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
we've got Scala which is the overdrive

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:17.380 
we've got Scala which is the overdrive
pedal

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.900 

and<00:02:18.390> we've<00:02:18.570> got<00:02:18.720> ivory<00:02:18.990> which<00:02:19.260> is<00:02:19.290> a<00:02:19.440> high-gain

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
and we've got ivory which is a high-gain

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:34.780 
and we've got ivory which is a high-gain
stacked<00:02:20.910> distortion<00:02:21.690> little

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.540 

then<00:02:35.790> there's<00:02:36.060> violet<00:02:36.950> 800<00:02:37.950> millisecond

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
then there's violet 800 millisecond

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:47.890 
then there's violet 800 millisecond
delay<00:02:38.670> fiddle

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:03:01.330 

you<00:02:48.680> go<00:02:48.799> for<00:02:48.980> this

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.350 

right<00:03:02.340> through<00:03:02.580> to<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:02.730> shortest<00:03:03.150> delay

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
right through to the shortest delay

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:10.350 
right through to the shortest delay
ceiling

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:27.380

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.530 

and<00:03:28.390> then<00:03:28.630> this<00:03:28.720> is<00:03:28.930> the<00:03:29.110> boost<00:03:29.620> Lily<00:03:30.540> here's
