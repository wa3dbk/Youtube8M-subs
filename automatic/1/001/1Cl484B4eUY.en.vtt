00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
couple of couple of things that I do a

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.880 
couple of couple of things that I do a
lot<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.640> play<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.539> in<00:00:27.720> tempo<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.650> then<00:00:28.710> we'll

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
lot and play it in tempo and then we'll

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:49.270 
lot and play it in tempo and then we'll
break<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.189> down<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.689> demonstrate<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.810> slower

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.910 

all<00:00:50.280> right<00:00:50.430> so<00:00:50.810> it<00:00:51.810> sounds<00:00:52.260> really<00:00:52.440> cool<00:00:52.739> and

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
all right so it sounds really cool and

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.290 
all right so it sounds really cool and
it<00:00:53.010> sounds<00:00:53.280> like<00:00:53.400> there's<00:00:53.580> a<00:00:53.670> lot<00:00:53.700> going<00:00:54.150> on

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
it sounds like there's a lot going on

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.020 
it sounds like there's a lot going on
but<00:00:54.600> in<00:00:54.809> reality<00:00:55.110> you're<00:00:56.010> really<00:00:56.400> just<00:00:56.610> using

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
but in reality you're really just using

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.910 
but in reality you're really just using
your<00:00:57.150> thumb<00:00:57.390> almost<00:00:57.780> like<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.960> pic<00:00:58.260> just<00:00:58.290> up<00:00:58.710> and

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
your thumb almost like a pic just up and

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.710 
your thumb almost like a pic just up and
down<00:00:59.130> and<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.550> rest<00:00:59.730> are<00:01:00.059> pull-offs<00:01:00.600> and

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
down and the rest are pull-offs and

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.420 
down and the rest are pull-offs and
hammer-ons<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.470> I'm<00:01:01.949> going<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.160> play<00:01:02.309> it

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
hammer-ons so I'm going to play it

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.830 
hammer-ons so I'm going to play it
really<00:01:02.670> slow<00:01:02.970> and<00:01:03.150> talk<00:01:03.360> about<00:01:03.600> what<00:01:03.750> I'm

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
really slow and talk about what I'm

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.450 
really slow and talk about what I'm
doing<00:01:04.170> here<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.559> start<00:01:05.430> off<00:01:05.550> with<00:01:05.580> just<00:01:07.310> with<00:01:08.310> my

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
doing here I start off with just with my

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.060 
doing here I start off with just with my
thumb<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:09.270> hammer<00:01:09.540> on<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.650> fifth

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
thumb and I hammer on to the fifth

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.210 
thumb and I hammer on to the fifth
string<00:01:11.690> to<00:01:12.690> the<00:01:12.810> C<00:01:13.020> then<00:01:13.500> after<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:13.950> it's

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
string to the C then after that it's

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:28.430 
string to the C then after that it's
just<00:01:14.280> up<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.850> down<00:01:14.970> with<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.270> thumb

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:35.750 

so<00:01:29.440> it's<00:01:29.710> just

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:35.760 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.290 

that's<00:01:36.270> what<00:01:36.420> creates<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:36.870> effect<00:01:37.790> and<00:01:38.790> you

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
that's what creates that effect and you

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.420 
that's what creates that effect and you
can<00:01:39.480> do<00:01:39.600> this<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:40.470> know<00:01:40.500> anywhere<00:01:41.160> you<00:01:41.310> can

can<00:02:10.410> also<00:02:10.590> try<00:02:10.980> finally<00:02:11.460> get<00:02:11.760> in<00:02:11.880> different

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
can also try finally get in different

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.900 
can also try finally get in different
ways<00:02:12.300> so<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:12.600> doesn't<00:02:12.990> you<00:02:13.920> know<00:02:14.070> catch<00:02:14.700> on<00:02:14.880> to

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
ways so it doesn't you know catch on to

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.820 
ways so it doesn't you know catch on to
the<00:02:15.120> string<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.570> kind<00:02:15.810> of<00:02:15.870> taper<00:02:16.080> off<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:16.530> sides

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
the string I kind of taper off the sides

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.320 
the string I kind of taper off the sides
so<00:02:18.110> with<00:02:19.110> that<00:02:19.260> said<00:02:19.880> there's<00:02:20.880> something<00:02:21.060> else

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
so with that said there's something else

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.600 
so with that said there's something else
that<00:02:21.420> I<00:02:21.540> do<00:02:21.660> a<00:02:21.810> lot<00:02:22.110> with<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.890> thumb<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.370> it's

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.360 
before but on two strings now and all it
is<00:02:27.600> is<00:02:27.660> you<00:02:28.290> play<00:02:28.500> a<00:02:28.530> Down<00:02:28.800> stroke<00:02:31.220> so<00:02:32.220> it's

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
is is you play a Down stroke so it's

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
is is you play a Down stroke so it's
just

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.050 

you

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
you

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.059 
you
now<00:02:37.239> what<00:02:37.780> makes<00:02:37.959> it<00:02:38.110> cool<00:02:38.260> is<00:02:38.470> when<00:02:38.650> you<00:02:38.800> add

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
now what makes it cool is when you add

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.339 
now what makes it cool is when you add
the<00:02:39.280> left<00:02:39.489> hand<00:02:39.730> and<00:02:39.910> I'll<00:02:40.540> play<00:02:40.750> a<00:02:40.780> little

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
the left hand and I'll play a little

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.740 
the left hand and I'll play a little
falsetto<00:02:41.860> from<00:02:42.220> solea<00:02:42.730> for<00:02:43.120> you<00:02:43.239> using<00:02:43.660> this

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
falsetto from solea for you using this

00:02:43.750 --> 00:03:12.480 
falsetto from solea for you using this
technique

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.700 

all<00:03:13.490> right<00:03:13.640> so<00:03:13.850> again<00:03:14.420> all<00:03:14.840> that<00:03:15.080> is<00:03:15.260> is<00:03:15.530> just

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.710 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.580 

hammer<00:03:18.710> ons<00:03:19.010> and<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:20.480> right<00:03:21.050> hands<00:03:21.260> doing<00:03:21.320> the

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
hammer ons and the right hands doing the

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.800 
hammer ons and the right hands doing the
same<00:03:21.830> thing<00:03:22.160> consider<00:03:22.640> consistently<00:03:23.630> she's

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
same thing consider consistently she's

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:31.700 
same thing consider consistently she's
down

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:39.690 

slides

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.690 

okay<00:03:40.329> and<00:03:40.510> the<00:03:40.569> last<00:03:40.749> thing<00:03:41.049> is<00:03:41.469> the<00:03:42.430> same

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
okay and the last thing is the same

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.220 
okay and the last thing is the same
technique<00:03:43.150> that<00:03:43.180> we<00:03:43.420> just<00:03:43.450> talked<00:03:43.840> about<00:03:43.959> on

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
technique that we just talked about on

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.039 
technique that we just talked about on
two<00:03:44.439> strings<00:03:44.969> but<00:03:45.969> now<00:03:46.030> traveling<00:03:46.840> up<00:03:46.959> and

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
two strings but now traveling up and

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:52.860 
two strings but now traveling up and
down<00:03:47.170> the<00:03:47.439> strings<00:03:48.120> so<00:03:49.120> again<00:03:49.480> it's<00:03:49.689> just<00:03:51.870> and

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
down the strings so again it's just and

00:03:52.870 --> 00:04:02.120 
down the strings so again it's just and
for<00:03:53.590> example<00:03:54.099> you<00:03:54.670> can<00:03:54.849> play<00:03:54.939> things<00:03:55.060> like

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.490 

began<00:04:03.130> all<00:04:03.280> I'm<00:04:03.430> doing<00:04:03.700> is<00:04:03.790> just<00:04:04.500> playing
