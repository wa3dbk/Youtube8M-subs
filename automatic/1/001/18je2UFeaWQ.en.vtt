00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
nice it's been a while since I've had my

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:31.980 
nice it's been a while since I've had my
my<00:04:30.460> other<00:04:30.729> NECA<00:04:31.030> alien<00:04:31.539> figures<00:04:31.780> and<00:04:31.900> I<00:04:31.930> don't

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
my other NECA alien figures and I don't

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.830 
my other NECA alien figures and I don't
remember<00:04:32.229> if<00:04:32.530> they<00:04:33.009> had<00:04:33.039> this<00:04:33.340> or<00:04:33.490> not<00:04:33.610> I<00:04:33.849> think

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
remember if they had this or not I think

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.350 
remember if they had this or not I think
they<00:04:35.110> did<00:04:36.009> have<00:04:36.190> that<00:04:36.340> feature<00:04:36.610> though<00:04:36.879> but

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
they did have that feature though but

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.330 
they did have that feature though but
this<00:04:37.810> is<00:04:38.020> just<00:04:38.199> a<00:04:38.349> beautiful<00:04:38.470> feature<00:04:39.039> my

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
this is just a beautiful feature my

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.580 
this is just a beautiful feature my
phone<00:04:39.520> just<00:04:39.669> went<00:04:39.759> off<00:04:39.909> the<00:04:40.120> the<00:04:41.020> slime<00:04:41.319> the

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
phone just went off the the slime the

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.140 
phone just went off the the slime the
wet<00:04:41.770> look<00:04:41.949> and<00:04:42.129> everything<00:04:42.400> just<00:04:42.580> looks<00:04:42.819> great

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
wet look and everything just looks great

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.529 
wet look and everything just looks great
now<00:04:43.539> let's<00:04:43.720> go<00:04:43.810> over<00:04:43.840> the<00:04:43.960> articulation<00:04:44.710> the

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:45.539 
now let's go over the articulation the

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:50.339 
now let's go over the articulation the
head<00:04:46.539> can<00:04:47.970> slightly<00:04:48.970> go<00:04:49.090> up<00:04:49.210> and<00:04:49.360> down<00:04:49.479> can

00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:50.349 
head can slightly go up and down can

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:52.050 
head can slightly go up and down can
rotate<00:04:50.620> not<00:04:51.220> too<00:04:51.400> much<00:04:51.580> so<00:04:51.729> you<00:04:51.819> got<00:04:51.909> to<00:04:52.000> be

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
rotate not too much so you got to be

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.210 
rotate not too much so you got to be
careful<00:04:52.449> with<00:04:52.569> these<00:04:52.690> little<00:04:52.870> like<00:04:53.050> little<00:04:53.740> I

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
careful with these little like little I

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.469 
careful with these little like little I
don't<00:04:54.759> know<00:04:54.819> what<00:04:54.909> you<00:04:54.970> want<00:04:55.090> to<00:04:55.150> call<00:04:55.330> these

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
don't know what you want to call these

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:57.450 
don't know what you want to call these
but<00:04:55.659> it's<00:04:55.810> attached<00:04:56.650> to<00:04:56.770> the<00:04:56.889> mouth<00:04:57.099> so<00:04:57.310> just

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
but it's attached to the mouth so just

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:58.649 
but it's attached to the mouth so just
be<00:04:57.550> careful<00:04:57.849> with<00:04:57.909> this<00:04:58.000> I<00:04:58.120> don't<00:04:58.330> rip<00:04:58.509> this

00:04:58.649 --> 00:04:58.659 
be careful with this I don't rip this

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:00.629 
be careful with this I don't rip this
off<00:04:58.889> so<00:04:59.889> don't<00:05:00.099> mess<00:05:00.250> with<00:05:00.310> the<00:05:00.490> head

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 
off so don't mess with the head

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:03.450 
off so don't mess with the head
articulation<00:05:01.240> too<00:05:01.509> much<00:05:01.750> arms<00:05:02.740> do<00:05:02.949> go<00:05:03.099> in<00:05:03.280> and

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
articulation too much arms do go in and

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.070 
articulation too much arms do go in and
out<00:05:03.550> that's<00:05:04.030> pretty<00:05:04.210> cool<00:05:04.479> to<00:05:04.630> go<00:05:04.720> in<00:05:04.870> and<00:05:05.020> out

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
out that's pretty cool to go in and out

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.439 
out that's pretty cool to go in and out
they<00:05:05.470> also<00:05:05.620> got<00:05:05.889> rotation<00:05:06.520> it's<00:05:07.000> got<00:05:07.120> to<00:05:07.240> bend

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:07.449 
they also got rotation it's got to bend

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:10.529 
they also got rotation it's got to bend
at<00:05:07.569> the<00:05:07.599> bicep<00:05:08.229> lower<00:05:08.889> arm<00:05:09.220> rotates<00:05:09.699> the<00:05:10.300> wrist

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539 
at the bicep lower arm rotates the wrist

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:12.600 
at the bicep lower arm rotates the wrist
can<00:05:10.690> go<00:05:10.750> in<00:05:10.900> and<00:05:11.020> out<00:05:11.110> and<00:05:11.380> rotate<00:05:11.919> he's<00:05:12.430> got

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
can go in and out and rotate he's got

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.480 
can go in and out and rotate he's got
upper<00:05:13.030> torso<00:05:14.020> articulation<00:05:14.919> which<00:05:15.250> allows

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
upper torso articulation which allows

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.640 
upper torso articulation which allows
them<00:05:15.669> to<00:05:15.729> rotate<00:05:15.909> there<00:05:16.300> and<00:05:16.509> it<00:05:17.169> can<00:05:17.319> slightly

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
them to rotate there and it can slightly

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.640 
them to rotate there and it can slightly
go<00:05:17.830> up<00:05:17.979> and<00:05:18.130> down<00:05:18.250> legs<00:05:18.819> go<00:05:19.030> in<00:05:19.210> and<00:05:19.360> out

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
go up and down legs go in and out

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.409 
go up and down legs go in and out
forward<00:05:20.650> and<00:05:20.770> back<00:05:21.069> he's<00:05:21.550> got<00:05:21.729> to<00:05:21.849> bend<00:05:22.180> at<00:05:22.360> the

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:22.419 
forward and back he's got to bend at the

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:24.240 
forward and back he's got to bend at the
knee<00:05:22.750> double<00:05:23.110> jointed<00:05:23.620> knees<00:05:23.680> we<00:05:24.099> got<00:05:24.219> a

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
knee double jointed knees we got a

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.029 
knee double jointed knees we got a
double<00:05:24.460> jointed<00:05:24.879> me<00:05:25.030> alien<00:05:25.680> rotations<00:05:26.680> leg<00:05:26.919> I

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 
double jointed me alien rotations leg I

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:29.339 
double jointed me alien rotations leg I
think<00:05:27.190> already<00:05:27.370> said<00:05:27.580> that<00:05:27.759> foot<00:05:28.750> can<00:05:29.020> go<00:05:29.110> up

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:29.349 
think already said that foot can go up

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:32.219 
think already said that foot can go up
oh<00:05:30.060> no<00:05:31.060> he's<00:05:31.210> got<00:05:31.300> foot<00:05:31.509> articulation<00:05:32.020> look<00:05:32.139> at

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:32.229 
oh no he's got foot articulation look at

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:33.570 
oh no he's got foot articulation look at
that<00:05:32.319> we're<00:05:32.440> tore<00:05:32.710> articulation

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
that we're tore articulation

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.189 
that we're tore articulation
you<00:05:34.090> can<00:05:34.210> see<00:05:34.389> that<00:05:34.539> right<00:05:34.690> there<00:05:34.960> that's

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 
you can see that right there that's

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:39.059 
you can see that right there that's
pretty<00:05:35.500> cool<00:05:35.680> and<00:05:35.889> the<00:05:36.639> foot<00:05:36.849> can<00:05:37.030> rotate<00:05:38.069> so

00:05:39.059 --> 00:05:39.069 
pretty cool and the foot can rotate so

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:41.159 
pretty cool and the foot can rotate so
