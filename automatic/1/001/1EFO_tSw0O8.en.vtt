of<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:06.049> SPF<00:03:06.739> now<00:03:07.400> you<00:03:08.090> how<00:03:08.420> many<00:03:08.600> minutes<00:03:08.810> does

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
of the SPF now you how many minutes does

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:10.660 
of the SPF now you how many minutes does
it<00:03:09.109> take<00:03:09.260> you<00:03:09.560> to<00:03:09.620> start<00:03:09.920> burning<00:03:10.069> outside

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
it take you to start burning outside

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.210 
it take you to start burning outside
well<00:03:11.569> let's<00:03:12.049> just<00:03:12.260> say<00:03:12.380> I<00:03:12.410> think<00:03:12.560> maybe<00:03:12.980> it's

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
well let's just say I think maybe it's

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.789 
well let's just say I think maybe it's
about<00:03:13.400> thirty<00:03:13.730> minutes<00:03:13.940> for<00:03:14.329> me<00:03:14.510> so<00:03:15.170> it's

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
about thirty minutes for me so it's

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.039 
about thirty minutes for me so it's
minutes<00:03:16.370> to<00:03:16.549> burn<00:03:16.790> without<00:03:17.329> sunscreen<00:03:17.690> that

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
minutes to burn without sunscreen that

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.539 
minutes to burn without sunscreen that
would<00:03:18.349> be<00:03:18.410> like<00:03:18.560> 30<00:03:18.769> minutes<00:03:19.220> for<00:03:19.400> me

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
would be like 30 minutes for me

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.250 
would be like 30 minutes for me
sometimes<00:03:20.269> which<00:03:20.540> this<00:03:20.750> year<00:03:20.959> I<00:03:21.019> haven't

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
sometimes which this year I haven't

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.849 
sometimes which this year I haven't
burned<00:03:21.500> but<00:03:21.739> traditionally<00:03:22.930> times<00:03:23.930> the<00:03:24.260> SPF

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:24.859 
burned but traditionally times the SPF

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:27.879 
burned but traditionally times the SPF
number<00:03:25.510> equals<00:03:26.510> the<00:03:26.720> maximum<00:03:26.900> sun<00:03:27.470> exposure

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:27.889 
number equals the maximum sun exposure

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:32.710 
number equals the maximum sun exposure
time<00:03:28.310> so<00:03:29.030> if<00:03:29.180> I<00:03:29.389> use<00:03:29.690> two<00:03:29.959> SPF<00:03:30.500> of<00:03:30.650> 20<00:03:31.480> like<00:03:32.480> if<00:03:32.599> I

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
time so if I use two SPF of 20 like if I

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.050 
time so if I use two SPF of 20 like if I
decided<00:03:33.049> I<00:03:33.230> was<00:03:33.349> gonna<00:03:33.470> pick<00:03:34.280> aloe<00:03:34.519> vera<00:03:34.790> and

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
decided I was gonna pick aloe vera and

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.339 
decided I was gonna pick aloe vera and
use<00:03:35.209> it<00:03:35.389> as<00:03:35.720> SPF<00:03:36.230> of<00:03:36.319> 20<00:03:37.120> then<00:03:38.120> I<00:03:38.239> would<00:03:38.510> say<00:03:38.840> 30

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:39.349 
use it as SPF of 20 then I would say 30

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.490 
use it as SPF of 20 then I would say 30
times<00:03:39.769> 20<00:03:40.430> because<00:03:41.000> 30<00:03:41.510> minutes<00:03:41.900> would<00:03:42.230> be<00:03:42.349> how

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
times 20 because 30 minutes would be how

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.050 
times 20 because 30 minutes would be how
long<00:03:42.709> I<00:03:42.829> could<00:03:42.889> stay<00:03:43.130> outside<00:03:43.430> without<00:03:43.519> burnin

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
long I could stay outside without burnin

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.930 
long I could stay outside without burnin
times<00:03:44.750> 20<00:03:45.290> which<00:03:45.319> would<00:03:45.620> be<00:03:45.709> the<00:03:45.829> SPF<00:03:46.340> of<00:03:46.519> aloe

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
times 20 which would be the SPF of aloe

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.530 
times 20 which would be the SPF of aloe
vera<00:03:47.150> that<00:03:47.599> would<00:03:48.230> leave<00:03:48.410> me<00:03:48.650> 6

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
vera that would leave me 6

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.679 
vera that would leave me 6
minutes<00:03:50.080> outside<00:03:50.549> without<00:03:51.549> burning<00:03:52.000> so

00:03:52.679 --> 00:03:52.689 
minutes outside without burning so

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:54.869 
minutes outside without burning so
that's<00:03:52.930> a<00:03:53.080> big<00:03:53.319> increase<00:03:53.560> from<00:03:54.069> 30<00:03:54.400> minutes<00:03:54.760> to

citrus<00:04:04.299> oils<00:04:04.659> can<00:04:04.810> make<00:04:04.959> your<00:04:05.110> skin<00:04:05.319> more

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379 
citrus oils can make your skin more

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:07.830 
citrus oils can make your skin more
sensitive<00:04:05.709> to<00:04:06.099> Sun<00:04:06.340> so<00:04:06.610> don't<00:04:07.150> put<00:04:07.420> citrus

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
sensitive to Sun so don't put citrus

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.500 
sensitive to Sun so don't put citrus
oils<00:04:08.200> in<00:04:08.440> your<00:04:09.450> you<00:04:10.450> know<00:04:10.480> your<00:04:11.670> anything<00:04:12.670> yeah

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
oils in your you know your anything yeah

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:14.970 
oils in your you know your anything yeah
because<00:04:13.900> you<00:04:14.230> won't<00:04:14.349> be<00:04:14.500> able<00:04:14.709> to<00:04:14.799> stay

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
because you won't be able to stay

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.219 
because you won't be able to stay
outside<00:04:15.129> as<00:04:15.489> long<00:04:15.519> now<00:04:16.239> your<00:04:16.479> skin<00:04:16.720> to<00:04:16.930> be<00:04:17.049> more

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
outside as long now your skin to be more

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:20.069 
outside as long now your skin to be more
sensitive<00:04:17.440> to<00:04:17.650> the<00:04:17.769> Sun<00:04:18.570> also<00:04:19.570> if<00:04:19.750> you<00:04:19.900> want

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
sensitive to the Sun also if you want

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.950 
sensitive to the Sun also if you want
some<00:04:20.260> extra<00:04:20.440> protection<00:04:21.090> you<00:04:22.090> can<00:04:22.270> put<00:04:22.539> some

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
some extra protection you can put some

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.560 
some extra protection you can put some
zinc<00:04:23.530> oxide<00:04:24.039> in<00:04:24.280> it<00:04:24.430> that's<00:04:24.639> what's<00:04:25.000> in<00:04:25.210> a<00:04:25.240> lot

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
zinc oxide in it that's what's in a lot

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.110 
zinc oxide in it that's what's in a lot
of<00:04:25.600> the<00:04:25.900> sunscreens<00:04:26.710> but<00:04:27.550> you<00:04:27.820> know<00:04:27.940> that's

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
of the sunscreens but you know that's

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.850 
of the sunscreens but you know that's
not<00:04:28.300> really<00:04:28.720> you<00:04:28.960> know<00:04:28.990> the<00:04:29.199> sunscreens<00:04:29.770> can

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
not really you know the sunscreens can

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.909 
not really you know the sunscreens can
be<00:04:30.100> dangerous<00:04:30.520> but<00:04:30.669> the<00:04:30.850> zinc<00:04:31.060> oxide<00:04:31.210> is<00:04:31.600> not

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
be dangerous but the zinc oxide is not

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.650 
be dangerous but the zinc oxide is not
necessarily<00:04:32.919> what<00:04:33.639> is<00:04:33.789> dangerous<00:04:34.120> it's<00:04:34.539> all

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
necessarily what is dangerous it's all

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.600 
necessarily what is dangerous it's all
the<00:04:34.810> other<00:04:34.930> chemicals<00:04:35.530> in<00:04:35.650> there<00:04:35.889> the<00:04:36.310> zinc

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
the other chemicals in there the zinc

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.680 
the other chemicals in there the zinc
oxide<00:04:36.789> what<00:04:37.479> it<00:04:37.630> does<00:04:37.870> is<00:04:38.530> it<00:04:39.150> it<00:04:40.150> gets<00:04:40.389> on<00:04:40.570> the

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
oxide what it does is it it gets on the

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.020 
oxide what it does is it it gets on the
skin<00:04:41.080> and<00:04:41.500> scatters<00:04:42.160> and<00:04:42.580> it<00:04:42.880> absorbs

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
skin and scatters and it absorbs

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.540 
skin and scatters and it absorbs
ultraviolet<00:04:43.840> radiation<00:04:44.650> now<00:04:45.220> a<00:04:45.250> lot<00:04:45.520> of

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
ultraviolet radiation now a lot of

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.029 
ultraviolet radiation now a lot of
people<00:04:45.699> want<00:04:46.030> to<00:04:46.120> avoid<00:04:46.630> the<00:04:47.039> nanoparticle

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:48.039 
people want to avoid the nanoparticle

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:52.469 
people want to avoid the nanoparticle
zinc<00:04:48.669> oxide<00:04:49.180> and<00:04:49.620> the<00:04:50.669> nanoparticle<00:04:51.669> is<00:04:51.880> a

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
zinc oxide and the nanoparticle is a

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:54.450 
zinc oxide and the nanoparticle is a
part<00:04:52.840> that's<00:04:53.139> smaller<00:04:53.470> than<00:04:53.620> 100<00:04:54.099> nanometers

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
part that's smaller than 100 nanometers

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.689 
part that's smaller than 100 nanometers
so<00:04:55.449> you<00:04:55.599> can<00:04:55.780> buy<00:04:55.990> zinc<00:04:56.320> oxide<00:04:56.770> powder<00:04:57.099> online

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:57.699 
so you can buy zinc oxide powder online

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:01.110 
so you can buy zinc oxide powder online
just<00:04:58.330> get<00:04:58.599> larger<00:04:59.380> than<00:04:59.590> 100<00:05:00.190> nanometers<00:05:00.430> if

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
just get larger than 100 nanometers if

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.820 
just get larger than 100 nanometers if
you<00:05:01.240> want<00:05:01.419> to<00:05:01.510> avoid<00:05:01.750> the<00:05:01.900> nanoparticles

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
you want to avoid the nanoparticles

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.860 
you want to avoid the nanoparticles
because<00:05:03.639> some<00:05:03.880> people<00:05:04.180> are<00:05:04.270> concerned<00:05:04.479> that

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
because some people are concerned that

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.750 
because some people are concerned that
these<00:05:05.020> nanoparticles<00:05:05.440> may<00:05:05.979> get<00:05:06.430> in<00:05:06.610> their

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
these nanoparticles may get in their

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.540 
these nanoparticles may get in their
bloodstream<00:05:07.030> or<00:05:07.870> inhale<00:05:08.860> them<00:05:09.160> which<00:05:09.340> would

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
bloodstream or inhale them which would

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.820 
bloodstream or inhale them which would
be<00:05:09.669> dangerous<00:05:10.150> so<00:05:10.960> you<00:05:10.990> might<00:05:11.440> want<00:05:11.620> to<00:05:11.650> use<00:05:11.800> a

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
be dangerous so you might want to use a

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.980 
be dangerous so you might want to use a
mask<00:05:12.160> even<00:05:12.699> if<00:05:12.820> I<00:05:12.940> got<00:05:13.150> something<00:05:13.539> with<00:05:13.690> not<00:05:13.960> a

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
mask even if I got something with not a

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.170 
mask even if I got something with not a
nanoparticle<00:05:14.410> I<00:05:15.070> would<00:05:15.220> use<00:05:15.370> a<00:05:15.400> mask<00:05:15.760> when<00:05:16.060> I

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
nanoparticle I would use a mask when I

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.029 
nanoparticle I would use a mask when I
mixed<00:05:16.479> it<00:05:16.599> in<00:05:16.720> it's<00:05:17.169> very<00:05:17.440> important<00:05:17.979> to

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.039 
mixed it in it's very important to

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:20.879 
mixed it in it's very important to
remember<00:05:18.130> yeah<00:05:19.060> and<00:05:19.300> you<00:05:19.389> just<00:05:19.419> take<00:05:19.889> like

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:20.889 
remember yeah and you just take like

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:23.250 
remember yeah and you just take like
about<00:05:21.220> two<00:05:21.550> teaspoons<00:05:21.849> per<00:05:22.360> cup<00:05:22.870> of<00:05:23.050> your<00:05:23.199> oil

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
about two teaspoons per cup of your oil

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.820 
about two teaspoons per cup of your oil
and<00:05:23.880> mix<00:05:24.880> it<00:05:25.090> in<00:05:25.240> to<00:05:25.840> your<00:05:25.930> oil<00:05:26.169> of<00:05:26.500> the<00:05:26.620> zinc

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
and mix it in to your oil of the zinc

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.700 
and mix it in to your oil of the zinc
oxide<00:05:27.280> say<00:05:27.820> 2<00:05:28.240> tablespoons<00:05:28.930> of<00:05:29.080> Zeke<00:05:29.229> outside

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
oxide say 2 tablespoons of Zeke outside

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.000 
oxide say 2 tablespoons of Zeke outside
per<00:05:30.250> one<00:05:30.490> cup<00:05:30.699> of<00:05:30.820> oil<00:05:31.740> naturally<00:05:32.740> that's<00:05:32.919> a

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
per one cup of oil naturally that's a

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.399 
per one cup of oil naturally that's a
natural<00:05:33.190> sunscreen<00:05:33.580> but<00:05:34.180> you<00:05:34.449> know<00:05:34.599> if<00:05:35.229> you

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:35.409 
natural sunscreen but you know if you

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:36.810 
natural sunscreen but you know if you
don't<00:05:35.620> if<00:05:35.770> you<00:05:35.860> don't<00:05:36.010> feel<00:05:36.130> comfortable<00:05:36.280> just

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
don't if you don't feel comfortable just

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.420 
don't if you don't feel comfortable just
using<00:05:37.210> the<00:05:37.270> oil<00:05:37.449> put<00:05:38.260> in<00:05:38.380> the<00:05:38.500> zinc<00:05:38.740> oxide<00:05:38.889> and

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
using the oil put in the zinc oxide and

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.129 
using the oil put in the zinc oxide and
you'll<00:05:39.550> know<00:05:39.820> that<00:05:40.150> you're<00:05:40.419> getting<00:05:40.630> my<00:05:40.900> good

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:41.139 
you'll know that you're getting my good

you'll know that you're getting my good
protection<00:05:41.530> that's<00:05:42.220> what<00:05:42.400> I<00:05:42.490> would<00:05:42.699> do<00:05:42.849> I'm

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
protection that's what I would do I'm

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:44.310 
protection that's what I would do I'm
not<00:05:43.120> telling<00:05:43.419> you<00:05:43.510> what<00:05:43.659> to<00:05:43.690> do<00:05:43.870> that's<00:05:44.020> what<00:05:44.169> I

not telling you what to do that's what I

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.450 
not telling you what to do that's what I
would<00:05:44.500> do<00:05:44.880> now<00:05:45.880> if<00:05:45.940> I<00:05:46.090> was<00:05:46.240> good<00:05:46.389> to<00:05:46.570> buy<00:05:46.780> a

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
would do now if I was good to buy a

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.010 
would do now if I was good to buy a
sunscreen<00:05:48.490> I<00:05:48.669> would<00:05:49.150> pick<00:05:49.330> badger<00:05:49.840> balm

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
sunscreen I would pick badger balm

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.080 
sunscreen I would pick badger balm
because<00:05:50.440> of<00:05:50.800> all<00:05:51.039> the<00:05:51.280> ones<00:05:51.490> I<00:05:51.639> have<00:05:51.669> found

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090 
because of all the ones I have found

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.089 
because of all the ones I have found
they're<00:05:52.720> the<00:05:52.900> only<00:05:53.050> ones<00:05:53.409> that<00:05:53.770> have<00:05:53.919> all

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:54.099 
they're the only ones that have all
