00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
in a 10 but it is not a cheap tin like

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.060 
in a 10 but it is not a cheap tin like
the<00:01:44.549> Hello<00:01:44.759> Kitty<00:01:44.850> palette<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:45.689> they<00:01:45.840> got<00:01:46.079> um

the Hello Kitty palette that they got um

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.350 
the Hello Kitty palette that they got um
but<00:01:47.850> inside<00:01:48.540> of<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.810> 10<00:01:49.079> they<00:01:49.890> have<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.909> inside

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
but inside of the 10 they have it inside

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.960 
but inside of the 10 they have it inside
something<00:01:51.750> else<00:01:51.930> so<00:01:52.110> inside<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.710> this<00:01:52.829> 10<00:01:53.159> they

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
something else so inside of this 10 they

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.940 
something else so inside of this 10 they
have<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.509> inside<00:01:54.899> of<00:01:55.049> something<00:01:55.320> else<00:01:55.500> and

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
have it inside of something else and

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.100 
have it inside of something else and
it's<00:01:56.189> it's<00:01:56.790> not<00:01:56.969> cheaply<00:01:57.240> made<00:01:57.509> at<00:01:57.689> all<00:01:57.840> and

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
it's it's not cheaply made at all and

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.580 
it's it's not cheaply made at all and
this<00:01:58.710> pally<00:01:59.070> comes<00:01:59.490> with<00:01:59.880> this<00:02:00.509> dual<00:02:01.079> ended

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
this pally comes with this dual ended

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.020 
this pally comes with this dual ended
brush<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:02.100> guess<00:02:02.280> this<00:02:02.430> is<00:02:02.610> supposed<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:02.880> be<00:02:02.969> a

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
brush I guess this is supposed to be a

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.710 
brush I guess this is supposed to be a
high<00:02:03.180> shadow<00:02:03.479> brush<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:04.079> is<00:02:04.590> synthetic

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
high shadow brush it is synthetic

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.330 
high shadow brush it is synthetic
so<00:02:06.050> I'll<00:02:06.170> probably<00:02:06.440> be<00:02:06.740> using<00:02:06.890> this<00:02:07.130> for

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
so I'll probably be using this for

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.150 
so I'll probably be using this for
concealer<00:02:07.730> or<00:02:07.910> something<00:02:08.300> or<00:02:09.290> paint<00:02:09.619> pots<00:02:09.860> but

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
concealer or something or paint pots but

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.860 
concealer or something or paint pots but
this<00:02:10.430> one<00:02:10.640> is<00:02:10.790> the<00:02:10.880> blending<00:02:11.270> brush<00:02:11.420> which<00:02:11.690> is

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
this one is the blending brush which is

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.430 
this one is the blending brush which is

of the Naked palette 1 they are but I
know<00:02:40.640> for<00:02:40.910> a<00:02:41.270> fact<00:02:41.330> that<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:42.320> only<00:02:42.560> color

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
know for a fact that the only color

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.770 
know for a fact that the only color
invest<00:02:43.430> tally<00:02:43.760> that<00:02:44.450> is<00:02:46.060> reprimanded<00:02:47.060> palette

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
invest tally that is reprimanded palette

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.420 
invest tally that is reprimanded palette
is<00:02:47.930> half-baked<00:02:48.350> so<00:02:48.530> this<00:02:48.709> is<00:02:48.890> the<00:02:48.950> only<00:02:49.100> shade

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
is half-baked so this is the only shade

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.550 
is half-baked so this is the only shade
in<00:02:49.610> this<00:02:49.820> tally<00:02:50.150> that<00:02:50.510> is<00:02:51.080> in<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.380> other
