00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.750 
we worked out like twice in this three
week<00:02:17.140> time<00:02:17.500> frame<00:02:17.530> because<00:02:18.130> I've<00:02:18.370> been<00:02:18.400> just

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
week time frame because I've been just

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.590 
week time frame because I've been just
so<00:02:18.940> busy<00:02:19.180> with<00:02:19.510> my<00:02:19.660> business<00:02:20.250> so<00:02:21.360> maybe<00:02:22.360> that

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
so busy with my business so maybe that

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.120 
so busy with my business so maybe that
was<00:02:22.750> why<00:02:22.900> I<00:02:22.960> was<00:02:23.050> able<00:02:23.260> to<00:02:23.440> go<00:02:23.560> through<00:02:23.740> three

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
was why I was able to go through three

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.130 
was why I was able to go through three
weeks<00:02:24.460> but<00:02:24.880> I<00:02:25.090> think<00:02:25.360> I<00:02:25.450> might<00:02:25.780> be<00:02:25.810> able<00:02:26.050> to

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
weeks but I think I might be able to

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.760 
weeks but I think I might be able to
pull<00:02:26.380> it<00:02:26.410> off<00:02:26.820> even<00:02:27.820> still<00:02:28.120> working<00:02:28.690> out<00:02:28.870> I'll
