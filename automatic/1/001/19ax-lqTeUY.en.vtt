 Hello friends 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:09.920
 that is the world of the sea 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:15.500
 world any if it is not the land of 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:19.780
 or of the adventure especially for a 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.780
 facebook kitchen there 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.930
 so to make it a surprise 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:38.220
 we go 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.220
 because we here beside the shoulder 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.710
 your house 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.880
 it did not and I did not find by 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.870
 Internet 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.740
 I'm looking for a good map 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.260
 and it does not meet 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.540
 I think it's a pretty good price 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.970
 why 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.970
 is the parrot they keep 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.870
 on the stairs 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.340
 natural to the other of the house yet 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.970
 Thank you 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.620

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.780
 rope pen 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.530

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.530
 exploring too much 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.210

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.979

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:05.540
