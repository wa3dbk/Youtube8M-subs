00:00:01.089 --> 00:00:04.336
		Welcome to ECE 3300, Introduction to

00:00:04.336 --> 00:00:07.337
Electromagnetics. In this lecture, we're going to

00:00:07.337 --> 00:00:10.875
review complex numbers and phasors in terms of how

00:00:10.875 --> 00:00:13.134
you are going to use them in electromagnetics. You've

00:00:13.134 --> 00:00:17.188
learned about these concepts before in your math and

00:00:17.188 --> 00:00:19.214
physics. What I want to show you is how we use

00:00:19.214 --> 00:00:22.178
complex numbers to make our math very simple in

00:00:22.178 --> 00:00:23.826
electromagnetics.

00:00:24.053 --> 00:00:30.063
		Let's first consider phasors. If we have a

00:00:30.063 --> 00:00:35.535
simple sin wave, perhaps this is a voltage. This is a

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:39.276
voltage that is propagating as a function of time. We

00:00:39.276 --> 00:00:43.491
can write that voltage as amplitude times the cosine of

00:00:43.491 --> 00:00:47.937
omega T minus beta Z, if it's going in the Z direction,

00:00:47.937 --> 00:00:52.758
plus V. If it happens to be going in the negative Z

00:00:52.758 --> 00:00:56.486
direction, this would be a positive. So there's our

00:00:56.486 --> 00:01:00.326
voltage. This is the time domain form of the voltage

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:03.833
because you can see that time is included in the

00:01:03.833 --> 00:01:05.193
equation.

00:01:05.193 --> 00:01:07.951
		This right here is the angular frequency that's

00:01:07.951 --> 00:01:11.589
given in radiance per second. This is the time given in

00:01:11.589 --> 00:01:15.258
seconds. This is the propagation constant given in

00:01:15.258 --> 00:01:17.732
radiance per meter and this is the distance traveled in

00:01:17.732 --> 00:01:21.974
meters. The face shift is also given in radiance.

00:01:21.974 --> 00:01:25.594
		The time domain form is very useful. It's the

00:01:25.594 --> 00:01:28.297
sort of thing we'd see on an oscilloscope but most of

00:01:28.297 --> 00:01:30.525
the time, we want to do our math in the frequency

00:01:30.525 --> 00:01:34.986
domain because it's easier. The frequency domain is

00:01:34.986 --> 00:01:39.798
also called the phasor domain and in this domain, it is

00:01:39.798 --> 00:01:42.976
assumed that we know the frequency. We can say that

00:01:42.976 --> 00:01:48.824
the frequency is implied. We can rewrite our voltage in

00:01:48.824 --> 00:01:52.257
terms of phasors where it is A instead of using cosine

00:01:52.257 --> 00:01:56.233
we use E to the J. It's going to be E to the J omega T

00:01:57.202 --> 00:02:02.272
E to the minus J beta Z and E to the J B.

00:02:02.882 --> 00:02:06.323
		Because this is the frequency domain this

00:02:06.323 --> 00:02:09.913
term right here E to the J omega T is assumed. It's

00:02:09.913 --> 00:02:13.111
implied. It's still there but it doesn't show up in the

00:02:13.111 --> 00:02:15.950
equation. It's interesting to remember that in

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.510
electrical engineering, we typically use E to the J

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.361
omega T and in physics, they typically use E to the

00:02:22.361 --> 00:02:26.293
minus J omega T. All that it does is changes the sign of

00:02:26.293 --> 00:02:29.756
the remaining terms in the complex numbers. So our

00:02:29.756 --> 00:02:35.746
voltage is A E to the minus J beta Z E to the J V and

00:02:35.746 --> 00:02:40.847
can also be written as A E to the J theta where theta

00:02:40.847 --> 00:02:43.951
minus beta Z plus V.
