Genesis that are like this and the humor

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.279 
Genesis that are like this and the humor
is<00:06:55.320> there<00:06:55.560> and<00:06:55.770> I<00:06:56.930> thought<00:06:57.930> it<00:06:57.990> was<00:06:58.140> pretty

00:06:58.279 --> 00:06:58.289 
is there and I thought it was pretty

00:06:58.289 --> 00:06:59.060 
is there and I thought it was pretty
good

00:06:59.060 --> 00:06:59.070 
good

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.250 
good
would<00:06:59.490> you<00:06:59.580> continue<00:06:59.820> yeah<00:07:00.690> I<00:07:00.840> get<00:07:01.050> the<00:07:01.140> new

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:01.260 
would you continue yeah I get the new

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.020 
would you continue yeah I get the new
button<00:07:01.469> this<00:07:01.650> yeah<00:07:02.219> I<00:07:02.250> keep<00:07:02.490> going<00:07:02.610> I<00:07:02.789> want<00:07:02.909> to

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:03.030 
button this yeah I keep going I want to

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.779 
button this yeah I keep going I want to
go<00:07:03.120> to<00:07:03.360> N<00:07:03.510> yeah<00:07:03.780> yeah<00:07:04.080> I<00:07:04.110> would<00:07:04.380> too<00:07:04.560> because<00:07:05.550> I

00:07:05.779 --> 00:07:05.789 
go to N yeah yeah I would too because I

00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:07.670 
go to N yeah yeah I would too because I
think<00:07:06.030> war<00:07:06.450> does<00:07:06.900> make<00:07:07.050> an<00:07:07.169> appearance<00:07:07.380> at<00:07:07.590> the

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680 
think war does make an appearance at the

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.010 
think war does make an appearance at the
end<00:07:07.710> so<00:07:08.010> although<00:07:09.000> I<00:07:09.120> will<00:07:09.300> say<00:07:09.330> this<00:07:09.570> game<00:07:09.719> I

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:10.020 
end so although I will say this game I

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.719 
end so although I will say this game I
mean<00:07:10.409> it's<00:07:10.560> pretty<00:07:10.740> difficult<00:07:10.979> every<00:07:11.580> time

00:07:11.719 --> 00:07:11.729 
mean it's pretty difficult every time

00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:13.279 
mean it's pretty difficult every time
you<00:07:11.849> die<00:07:12.000> you<00:07:12.030> have<00:07:12.210> the<00:07:12.360> restart<00:07:12.810> over<00:07:13.050> again

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:13.289 
you die you have the restart over again

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:15.380 
you die you have the restart over again
so<00:07:14.010> I<00:07:14.039> think<00:07:14.130> that<00:07:14.430> you<00:07:14.550> have<00:07:14.669> to<00:07:14.760> be<00:07:14.880> pretty

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:15.390 
so I think that you have to be pretty

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:16.909 
so I think that you have to be pretty
good<00:07:15.690> at<00:07:15.780> the<00:07:15.900> game<00:07:16.050> to<00:07:16.260> probably<00:07:16.560> get<00:07:16.680> through

00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:16.919 
good at the game to probably get through

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:18.380 
good at the game to probably get through
