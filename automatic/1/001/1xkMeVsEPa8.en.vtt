00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
the things but you know given how much

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.030 
the things but you know given how much
this<00:00:53.629> has<00:00:53.780> changed<00:00:54.199> in<00:00:54.290> the<00:00:54.320> last<00:00:54.379> two<00:00:55.010> or

three<00:00:55.190> years<00:00:55.489> yeah<00:00:55.820> it<00:00:56.150> might<00:00:56.300> be<00:00:56.420> worth<00:00:56.570> at

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
three years yeah it might be worth at

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.210 
three years yeah it might be worth at
least<00:00:56.780> asking<00:00:57.290> if<00:00:57.409> it<00:00:57.500> makes<00:00:57.680> sense<00:00:57.830> to<00:00:57.979> do<00:00:58.190> it

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
close this off like Jeff said open the

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.479 
close this off like Jeff said open the
other<00:02:06.820> portal<00:02:07.660> yeah<00:02:08.140> that's<00:02:09.070> none<00:02:09.340> of<00:02:09.429> the

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
other portal yeah that's none of the

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.580 
other portal yeah that's none of the
range<00:02:09.640> of<00:02:09.729> options<00:02:10.090> honestly<00:02:10.509> the<00:02:11.200> real

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
range of options honestly the real

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.009 
range of options honestly the real
question<00:02:11.950> is<00:02:12.010> do<00:02:12.190> we<00:02:12.220> think<00:02:12.550> and<00:02:13.480> this<00:02:13.810> is<00:02:13.959> the

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
question is do we think and this is the

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.560 
question is do we think and this is the
one's<00:02:14.200> gonna<00:02:14.260> be<00:02:14.350> hard<00:02:14.530> hard<00:02:15.040> to<00:02:15.220> address<00:02:15.850> is

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
one's gonna be hard hard to address is

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.420 
one's gonna be hard hard to address is
do<00:02:16.959> we<00:02:17.050> think<00:02:17.320> the<00:02:17.410> recreational<00:02:17.950> use<00:02:18.100> on<00:02:18.280> this

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
do we think the recreational use on this

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.990 
do we think the recreational use on this
thing<00:02:18.610> in<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.760> summertime<00:02:19.060> is<00:02:21.000> causing

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
thing in the summertime is causing

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.580 
thing in the summertime is causing
enough<00:02:22.150> of<00:02:22.269> an<00:02:22.360> impact<00:02:22.600> on<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:23.050> area<00:02:23.080> on<00:02:23.500> the

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
enough of an impact on the area on the

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.380 
enough of an impact on the area on the
wildlife<00:02:23.980> on<00:02:24.160> whatever<00:02:24.519> portion<00:02:24.970> of<00:02:25.180> golf's

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
wildlife on whatever portion of golf's

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.210 
wildlife on whatever portion of golf's
you<00:02:25.480> want<00:02:25.660> to<00:02:25.750> identify<00:02:26.350> that<00:02:26.920> we<00:02:27.040> should

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
you want to identify that we should

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.580 
you want to identify that we should
close<00:02:27.519> this<00:02:27.730> trail<00:02:27.970> all<00:02:28.120> together<00:02:28.420> when<00:02:29.230> the

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
close this trail all together when the

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.070 
close this trail all together when the
new<00:02:29.620> trail<00:02:30.040> is<00:02:30.220> open<00:02:30.340> I<00:02:30.730> think<00:02:31.420> that<00:02:31.570> the<00:02:31.690> local

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
new trail is open I think that the local

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.050 
new trail is open I think that the local
people<00:02:32.260> that<00:02:33.010> don't<00:02:33.370> want<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.640> go<00:02:33.730> through<00:02:34.000> the

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
people that don't want to go through the

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.520 
people that don't want to go through the
base<00:02:34.239> of<00:02:34.390> peak<00:02:34.510> eight<00:02:34.690> will<00:02:34.930> still<00:02:35.140> use<00:02:35.170> this

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
base of peak eight will still use this

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.590 
base of peak eight will still use this
if<00:02:35.739> it's<00:02:35.890> open<00:02:36.010> to<00:02:36.220> bikes<00:02:36.430> at<00:02:36.580> that<00:02:36.700> point<00:02:36.970> but

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
if it's open to bikes at that point but

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.509 
if it's open to bikes at that point but
um<00:02:37.989> you<00:02:38.260> know<00:02:38.380> we're<00:02:38.650> all<00:02:38.769> surmising<00:02:39.400> this

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
um you know we're all surmising this

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:40.890 
um you know we're all surmising this
without<00:02:39.760> an<00:02:39.880> effect<00:02:40.180> is<00:02:40.360> always<00:02:40.660> to<00:02:40.780> get

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
without an effect is always to get

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.319 
without an effect is always to get
people<00:02:41.140> coming<00:02:41.440> from<00:02:41.620> Frisco<00:02:42.010> up<00:02:42.250> to<00:02:42.940> use<00:02:43.150> that

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
people coming from Frisco up to use that

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:44.740 
people coming from Frisco up to use that
way<00:02:43.570> rather<00:02:43.810> than<00:02:43.989> coming

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
way rather than coming

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.390 
way rather than coming
and<00:02:45.050> will<00:02:45.290> require<00:02:45.440> a<00:02:45.650> bit<00:02:45.890> a<00:02:45.950> little<00:02:45.980> bit<00:02:46.250> of<00:02:46.370> a

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
and will require a bit a little bit of a

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.950 
and will require a bit a little bit of a
climb<00:02:46.610> but<00:02:46.880> hopefully<00:02:47.180> it's<00:02:47.300> fun<00:02:47.510> enough<00:02:47.720> and

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
climb but hopefully it's fun enough and

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.360 
climb but hopefully it's fun enough and
it<00:02:48.020> kind<00:02:48.530> of<00:02:48.560> serves<00:02:48.800> on<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:48.980> purposes<00:02:49.340> that

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
it kind of serves on the purposes that

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.760 
it kind of serves on the purposes that
good<00:02:50.120> night<00:02:50.240> so<00:02:50.390> we'll<00:02:50.480> have<00:02:50.540> a<00:02:50.600> science<00:02:50.810> a<00:02:51.170> to

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
good night so we'll have a science a to

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.130 
good night so we'll have a science a to
town<00:02:51.980> to<00:02:52.370> peak<00:02:52.550> seven<00:02:52.760> to<00:02:52.970> pique<00:02:53.300> and<00:02:53.960> then

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
town to peak seven to pique and then

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.320 
town to peak seven to pique and then
they'll<00:02:54.320> say<00:02:54.470> county<00:02:54.800> road<00:02:54.980> three<00:02:55.610> I<00:02:55.850> think

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
they'll say county road three I think

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.820 
they'll say county road three I think
that<00:02:56.600> takes<00:02:56.810> trailhead<00:02:57.200> so<00:02:57.350> pretty<00:02:57.560> much<00:02:57.620> all

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
that takes trailhead so pretty much all

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.500 
that takes trailhead so pretty much all
you<00:02:57.860> really<00:02:58.190> know<00:02:58.430> if<00:02:58.820> you<00:02:59.120> don't<00:02:59.420> already

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
you really know if you don't already

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.570 
you really know if you don't already
going<00:02:59.870> you<00:03:00.260> go<00:03:00.350> to<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.650> county<00:03:00.860> road<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.490> the

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
going you go to the county road to the

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.190 
going you go to the county road to the
triad<00:03:01.940> you<00:03:02.150> want<00:03:02.300> to<00:03:02.360> go<00:03:02.420> to<00:03:02.480> town<00:03:02.720> or<00:03:03.020> that's

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
triad you want to go to town or that's

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.780 
triad you want to go to town or that's
TNT<00:03:03.500> area<00:03:03.709> so<00:03:03.890> hopefully<00:03:03.980> that<00:03:04.280> sends<00:03:04.640> people

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
TNT area so hopefully that sends people

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.760 
TNT area so hopefully that sends people
that<00:03:05.060> way<00:03:05.240> connect<00:03:05.780> name<00:03:06.140> Peaks<00:03:06.440> attack<00:03:06.650> would

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
that way connect name Peaks attack would

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.500 
that way connect name Peaks attack would
be<00:03:06.860> starting<00:03:07.190> right<00:03:07.340> here<00:03:07.370> right<00:03:07.550> and<00:03:08.390> it

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
be starting right here right and it

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:09.430 
be starting right here right and it
would<00:03:08.600> basically<00:03:08.750> a<00:03:08.959> race<00:03:09.080> at<00:03:09.110> the<00:03:09.230> top<00:03:09.320> of

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
would basically a race at the top of

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.140 
would basically a race at the top of
this<00:03:09.590> training<00:03:09.830> Richard<00:03:10.130> call<00:03:10.580> it<00:03:10.700> fence<00:03:10.970> on

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
this training Richard call it fence on

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.010 
this training Richard call it fence on
to<00:03:11.780> get<00:03:11.959> to<00:03:12.320> cross<00:03:12.560> the<00:03:12.770> peak<00:03:12.920> seven<00:03:13.660> so<00:03:14.660> let's

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
to get to cross the peak seven so let's

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.190 
to get to cross the peak seven so let's
walk<00:03:15.170> the<00:03:15.320> alignment<00:03:16.750> trail<00:03:17.750> counter<00:03:18.020> here

to get a bridge over the alpine slide
and<00:04:34.330> go<00:04:34.420> pretty<00:04:34.630> much<00:04:34.690> at<00:04:34.900> grade<00:04:35.200> are<00:04:35.440> pretty

and go pretty much at grade are pretty
close<00:04:35.830> tutor<00:04:36.250> and<00:04:36.550> then<00:04:37.120> they<00:04:37.210> have<00:04:37.330> the

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:37.420 
close tutor and then they have the

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.820 
close tutor and then they have the
ability<00:04:37.720> to<00:04:37.780> kind<00:04:37.990> of<00:04:38.080> put<00:04:38.320> this<00:04:38.440> connection

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
ability to kind of put this connection

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:39.870 
ability to kind of put this connection
all<00:04:38.920> the<00:04:38.980> way<00:04:39.070> through<00:04:39.310> so<00:04:39.520> that<00:04:39.550> is<00:04:39.760> the

all the way through so that is the

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
all the way through so that is the
intimate<00:04:40.210> to<00:04:40.480> try<00:04:40.630> to<00:04:40.690> have<00:04:40.870> a
