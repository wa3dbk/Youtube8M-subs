00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
ones that I find that I just reach for a

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.820 
ones that I find that I just reach for a
lot<00:00:17.699> that<00:00:18.000> are<00:00:18.119> really<00:00:18.420> easily<00:00:18.869> wearable<00:00:19.529> and

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
that I find are really flattering I

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.230 
that I find are really flattering I
guess<00:00:22.859> I<00:00:23.039> should<00:00:23.189> show<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.789> one<00:00:23.939> that<00:00:24.119> I'm

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
guess I should show you the one that I'm

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.330 
guess I should show you the one that I'm
wearing<00:00:24.269> first<00:00:24.930> on<00:00:25.350> that<00:00:25.650> just<00:00:25.890> kind<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.099> makes

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
wearing first on that just kind of makes

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.599 
wearing first on that just kind of makes
sense<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:27.119> this<00:00:27.900> lipstick<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.490> kind<00:00:29.490> of

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
sense and this lipstick is kind of

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.370 
sense and this lipstick is kind of
intimidating<00:00:29.880> but<00:00:30.689> I've<00:00:30.810> literally<00:00:31.199> never

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
intimidating but I've literally never

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.040 
intimidating but I've literally never
heard<00:00:31.949> anybody<00:00:32.460> say<00:00:32.940> anything<00:00:33.090> about<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.930> and

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
heard anybody say anything about it and

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.600 
heard anybody say anything about it and
I<00:00:34.140> think<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.440> reason<00:00:34.590> for<00:00:34.890> that<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.579> a

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
I think the reason for that is that is a

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.720 
I think the reason for that is that is a
frost<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.780> in<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.559> YouTube<00:00:37.890> community<00:00:38.100> frost

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
frost and in the YouTube community frost

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.150 
frost and in the YouTube community frost
don't<00:00:39.210> get<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.540> lot<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.780> love<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.649> understand

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
don't get a lot of love and I understand

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.280 
don't get a lot of love and I understand
why<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:41.790> it's<00:00:42.090> because<00:00:42.750> they<00:00:42.930> tend<00:00:43.110> to

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
why that is it's because they tend to

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.500 
why that is it's because they tend to
have<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.500> little<00:00:43.770> bit<00:00:44.010> more<00:00:44.190> shimmer<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.879> be<00:00:45.480> a

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
have a little bit more shimmer and be a

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.139 
have a little bit more shimmer and be a
little<00:00:45.840> bit<00:00:46.020> less<00:00:46.200> moisturizing<00:00:47.070> than<00:00:47.730> other

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
little bit less moisturizing than other

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.270 
little bit less moisturizing than other
lipsticks<00:00:48.660> from<00:00:48.930> Mac<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:49.860> this<00:00:50.010> one<00:00:50.190> is

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.310 
of gold shimmer in it and I remember I
brought<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.090> home<00:01:12.299> from<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.659> store<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.200> as

brought this home from the store and as

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.289 
brought this home from the store and as
soon<00:01:13.560> as<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.830> saw<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.100> in<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:15.060> know<00:01:15.090> the

soon as I saw it in the you know the

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.929 
soon as I saw it in the you know the
unused<00:01:15.869> lipstick<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.770> sort<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.159> look<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.790> bit

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
unused lipstick and sort of look a bit

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.429 
unused lipstick and sort of look a bit
different<00:01:17.970> than<00:01:18.479> when<00:01:18.600> you've<00:01:18.720> used<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.200> for<00:01:19.409> a

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
different than when you've used it for a

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.170 
different than when you've used it for a
while<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.979> really<00:01:20.400> really<00:01:20.670> sort<00:01:21.150> of

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
while it really really sort of

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.609 
while it really really sort of
intimidated<00:01:21.810> me<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:22.020> thought<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.409> would<00:01:22.500> look

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
intimidated me I thought it would look

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.870 
intimidated me I thought it would look
really<00:01:22.759> frosty<00:01:23.759> on<00:01:23.909> me<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.770> it<00:01:25.770> can<00:01:26.189> if<00:01:26.670> you

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
really frosty on me and it can if you

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.420 
really frosty on me and it can if you
just<00:01:27.119> wear<00:01:27.540> like<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.990> thick<00:01:28.470> coating<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.310> on

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
just wear like a thick coating of it on

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.969 
just wear like a thick coating of it on
your<00:01:29.610> lips<00:01:29.790> without<00:01:30.290> blending<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.530> in<00:01:31.740> with

your finger or putting a lip gloss on
top<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.890> can<00:01:35.130> look<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.549> little<00:01:35.579> bit<00:01:35.939> like<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:36.390> I

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600

shimmer<00:04:50.790> in<00:04:50.940> it<00:04:51.030> like<00:04:51.240> this<00:04:51.480> is<00:04:51.720> it<00:04:52.440> just<00:04:52.710> wears

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
shimmer in it like this is it just wears

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.070 
shimmer in it like this is it just wears
like<00:04:53.190> a<00:04:53.220> cream<00:04:53.610> machine<00:04:53.940> really<00:04:54.210> and<00:04:54.690> it<00:04:54.810> looks

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
like a cream machine really and it looks

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.540 
like a cream machine really and it looks
like<00:04:55.170> a<00:04:55.290> cream<00:04:55.620> sheen<00:04:55.890> and<00:04:56.130> it<00:04:56.250> probably

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
like a cream sheen and it probably

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.600 
like a cream sheen and it probably
should<00:04:56.850> be<00:04:57.060> a<00:04:57.210> cream<00:04:57.510> sheen<00:04:57.840> and<00:04:58.200> if<00:04:59.070> it<00:04:59.400> has

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
should be a cream sheen and if it has

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.720 
should be a cream sheen and if it has
any<00:05:00.230> silver<00:05:01.230> shimmer<00:05:01.830> to<00:05:02.130> it<00:05:02.160> then<00:05:02.550> it's

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
any silver shimmer to it then it's

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.230 
any silver shimmer to it then it's
virtually<00:05:03.450> invisible<00:05:04.280> to<00:05:05.280> the<00:05:05.460> eye<00:05:05.490> and<00:05:06.120> i

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
virtually invisible to the eye and i

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.290 
virtually invisible to the eye and i
just<00:05:06.480> adore<00:05:06.900> this<00:05:07.110> because<00:05:07.710> it<00:05:08.070> just<00:05:08.550> looks<00:05:08.910> so
