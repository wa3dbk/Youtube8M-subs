a<00:01:56.610> year-long<00:01:56.850> process<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.540> even<00:01:57.689> apply<00:01:57.930> and

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
a year-long process to even apply and

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.139 
a year-long process to even apply and
the<00:01:58.890> pre-med<00:01:59.219> advising<00:01:59.670> Department<00:02:00.060> is

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
the pre-med advising Department is

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.940 
the pre-med advising Department is
really<00:02:00.450> upfront<00:02:00.630> about<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.530> they

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
really upfront about that and they

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.530 
really upfront about that and they
really<00:02:02.189> help<00:02:02.369> guide<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:02.939> would<00:02:03.299> not

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
really help guide you so I would not

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.850 
really help guide you so I would not
have<00:02:03.689> been<00:02:03.899> nearly<00:02:04.049> as<00:02:04.229> successful<00:02:04.439> without

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
have been nearly as successful without

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.039 
have been nearly as successful without
them<00:02:05.189> we<00:02:05.759> can<00:02:05.939> discuss<00:02:06.329> with<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.630> students

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
them we can discuss with the students

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.869 
them we can discuss with the students
not<00:02:07.259> only<00:02:07.530> their<00:02:07.680> course<00:02:08.009> selection<00:02:08.580> which<00:02:08.729> is

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
not only their course selection which is

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:09.779 
not only their course selection which is
something<00:02:09.119> that

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
something that

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.699 
something that
most<00:02:09.969> students<00:02:10.360> early<00:02:10.689> on<00:02:10.869> a<00:02:10.899> very<00:02:11.260> interest

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
most students early on a very interest

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.559 
most students early on a very interest
in<00:02:11.860> discussing<00:02:12.250> with<00:02:12.519> us<00:02:12.730> but<00:02:13.269> we're<00:02:13.390> also

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
in discussing with us but we're also

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:14.849 
in discussing with us but we're also
going<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:13.959> talk<00:02:14.260> to<00:02:14.469> them<00:02:14.680> about

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:14.859 
going to talk to them about

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:17.429 
going to talk to them about
opportunities<00:02:15.510> here<00:02:16.510> in<00:02:16.629> Boston<00:02:17.109> or<00:02:17.230> perhaps

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:17.439 
opportunities here in Boston or perhaps

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:19.440 
opportunities here in Boston or perhaps
near<00:02:17.890> their<00:02:18.099> homes<00:02:18.370> in<00:02:18.790> order<00:02:19.120> for<00:02:19.299> them<00:02:19.420> to

near their homes in order for them to

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.770 
near their homes in order for them to
acquire<00:02:20.310> clinical<00:02:21.310> exposure<00:02:21.790> or<00:02:22.269> research

organizations we will not hand them
these<00:02:31.569> internships<00:02:32.079> but<00:02:32.920> help<00:02:33.099> provide

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
these internships but help provide

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.160 
these internships but help provide
guidance<00:02:33.819> about<00:02:33.970> how<00:02:34.120> they<00:02:34.420> go<00:02:34.599> about<00:02:34.629> looking

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
guidance about how they go about looking

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.710 
guidance about how they go about looking
for<00:02:35.590> them<00:02:35.709> and<00:02:35.889> how<00:02:35.980> they<00:02:36.129> contact<00:02:36.730> people<00:02:37.150> to

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
for them and how they contact people to

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.050 
for them and how they contact people to
acquire<00:02:38.079> such<00:02:38.439> positions<00:02:39.069> so<00:02:39.579> actually<00:02:39.969> the

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
acquire such positions so actually the

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.670 
acquire such positions so actually the
way<00:02:40.150> I<00:02:40.180> got<00:02:40.359> involved<00:02:40.629> in<00:02:40.840> research<00:02:40.870> at<00:02:41.260> BU<00:02:41.379> was

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
way I got involved in research at BU was

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.349 
way I got involved in research at BU was
directly<00:02:42.010> through<00:02:42.280> BU<00:02:42.549> they<00:02:42.849> have<00:02:42.939> a<00:02:43.000> program

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:43.359 
directly through BU they have a program

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:44.369 
directly through BU they have a program
called<00:02:43.569> the<00:02:43.689> undergraduate<00:02:44.200> research

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
called the undergraduate research

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:47.069 
called the undergraduate research
opportunities<00:02:45.310> program<00:02:45.340> and<00:02:45.970> I<00:02:46.569> actually<00:02:46.780> got

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
opportunities program and I actually got

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:48.960 
opportunities program and I actually got
a<00:02:47.109> summer<00:02:47.290> grant<00:02:47.680> through<00:02:48.370> them<00:02:48.519> and<00:02:48.819> they

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
a summer grant through them and they

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.610 
a summer grant through them and they
placed<00:02:49.239> me<00:02:49.419> in<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:49.599> current<00:02:49.840> lab<00:02:49.989> I'm<00:02:50.169> in<00:02:50.319> and

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
placed me in the current lab I'm in and

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.199 
placed me in the current lab I'm in and
it<00:02:51.129> actually<00:02:51.489> worked<00:02:51.669> out<00:02:51.730> well<00:02:51.879> because<00:02:52.120> I

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
it actually worked out well because I

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.149 
it actually worked out well because I
had<00:02:52.389> a<00:02:52.419> class<00:02:52.659> with<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:53.159> principal

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 
had a class with the principal

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:56.670 
had a class with the principal
investigator<00:02:54.609> so<00:02:55.000> I<00:02:55.269> knew<00:02:56.200> his<00:02:56.349> research

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
investigator so I knew his research

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.020 
investigator so I knew his research
already<00:02:56.859> and<00:02:57.220> it<00:02:57.280> worked<00:02:57.459> out<00:02:57.639> really<00:02:57.760> nicely

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
already and it worked out really nicely

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.990 
already and it worked out really nicely
so<00:02:58.540> I<00:02:59.040> working<00:03:00.040> with<00:03:00.189> school<00:03:00.519> medical

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
so I working with school medical

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.420 
so I working with school medical
brigades<00:03:01.359> which<00:03:01.720> actually<00:03:02.409> goes<00:03:02.889> abroad<00:03:03.220> to

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
brigades which actually goes abroad to

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.819 
brigades which actually goes abroad to
Honduras<00:03:04.030> and<00:03:04.389> then<00:03:04.629> sets<00:03:04.900> up<00:03:05.109> a<00:03:05.349> free<00:03:05.590> clinic

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
Honduras and then sets up a free clinic

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.610 
Honduras and then sets up a free clinic
there<00:03:06.189> and<00:03:06.340> that<00:03:06.489> treats<00:03:06.970> people<00:03:07.209> for<00:03:07.510> free<00:03:07.689> so

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
there and that treats people for free so

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.399 
there and that treats people for free so
we<00:03:08.829> see<00:03:09.310> a<00:03:09.340> lot<00:03:09.639> of<00:03:09.669> like<00:03:09.939> villagers<00:03:10.480> with<00:03:11.139> the

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:11.409 
we see a lot of like villagers with the

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:13.920 
we see a lot of like villagers with the
to<00:03:11.829> go<00:03:12.010> with<00:03:12.400> without<00:03:12.970> health<00:03:13.269> care<00:03:13.510> their

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
to go with without health care their

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.719 
to go with without health care their
whole<00:03:14.139> lives<00:03:14.489> so<00:03:15.489> it's<00:03:16.419> a<00:03:16.540> very<00:03:16.750> unique<00:03:17.199> and

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:17.729 
whole lives so it's a very unique and

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:21.089 
whole lives so it's a very unique and
rewarding<00:03:18.810> experience<00:03:19.810> I<00:03:20.109> mostly<00:03:20.949> do

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
rewarding experience I mostly do

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.149 
rewarding experience I mostly do
research<00:03:21.430> on<00:03:21.669> memory<00:03:21.849> I<00:03:22.209> focus<00:03:22.780> on<00:03:23.049> a<00:03:23.470> part<00:03:24.099> of

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:24.159 
research on memory I focus on a part of

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:26.219 
research on memory I focus on a part of
the<00:03:24.250> brain<00:03:24.400> called<00:03:24.579> hippocampus<00:03:25.180> it's<00:03:25.870> kind

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:26.229 
the brain called hippocampus it's kind

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:28.439 
the brain called hippocampus it's kind
of<00:03:26.319> known<00:03:26.530> for<00:03:26.560> helping<00:03:27.129> navigation<00:03:27.760> and<00:03:28.180> it's

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:28.449 
of known for helping navigation and it's

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:29.550 
of known for helping navigation and it's
really<00:03:28.599> cool<00:03:28.750> because<00:03:28.959> we<00:03:29.169> actually<00:03:29.290> do

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
really cool because we actually do

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.589 
really cool because we actually do
recordings<00:03:30.099> from<00:03:30.459> the<00:03:30.549> brain<00:03:30.729> so<00:03:31.389> we<00:03:31.479> have

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
recordings from the brain so we have

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:32.610 
recordings from the brain so we have
rats<00:03:31.810> that<00:03:31.989> have<00:03:32.139> these<00:03:32.260> things<00:03:32.379> that<00:03:32.530> look

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
rats that have these things that look

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.349 
rats that have these things that look
basically<00:03:33.280> little<00:03:33.549> hats<00:03:33.729> where<00:03:34.090> we<00:03:34.180> have

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359 
basically little hats where we have

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:36.059 
basically little hats where we have
wires<00:03:34.750> going<00:03:35.199> down<00:03:35.379> into<00:03:35.620> their<00:03:35.739> brain<00:03:35.919> and

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
wires going down into their brain and

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:37.710 
wires going down into their brain and
recording<00:03:36.519> neural<00:03:36.760> activity<00:03:37.180> so<00:03:37.419> it's<00:03:37.599> really

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
recording neural activity so it's really

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.780 
recording neural activity so it's really
cool<00:03:37.930> we<00:03:38.260> are<00:03:38.349> always<00:03:38.530> talking<00:03:38.889> to<00:03:39.250> students

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
cool we are always talking to students
