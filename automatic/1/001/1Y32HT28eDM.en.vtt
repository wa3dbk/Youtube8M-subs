00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.889
 Welcome to a new chapter of 

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:11.980
 rapids minecraft series and good does 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:14.110
 while not uploading videos but it's because 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.189
 we are in all this change of versions 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.480
 of the 1.6 and this pod not launcher 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:21.310
 so then I could not play with the 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.500
 industrial craft melville craft that of 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.259
 made the vile craft has not come out then 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.289
 today I come to show you how to install the 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:31.900
 industrial kraft for minecraft 1.6 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:34.020
 point 2 how can you see this here in the 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.390
 in the launcher 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.950
 but well let's see how we are going to 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.630
 do it here what we are going to do is 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.370
 first go to the links that I will give 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.620
 down in which we will be able to 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.250
 download these two files which is the 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.040
 minecraft force and the industrial craft 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.230
 then we are going to 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.860
 use the minecraft let's give it double 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.180
 click and this window will appear 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.880
 Now what we are going to do is give you 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.030
 install customer client means that 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.880
 is for us or for a game in a 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.860
 player and install server is for 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.990
 you have a server you can install 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.850
 the force and be able to play with force in its 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.860
 server with your friends we will give to 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.010
 accept and we will appear this that 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.320
 means that it says that already 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.420
 was already installing client 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.150
 customer profile of the force version 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.830
 data is in the launcher very well now 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.780
 to check that if we were installed 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:31.160
 this is going to high percentage app 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:35.390
 percentage point minecraft versions and 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:37.640
 look here is this 1.6 points force 9 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.220
 points to tata tata if I erase it there's no 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.410
 problem I just come here I give 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.760
 again to install and as you can see me 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.560
 will install it without any problem 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.920
 this is going to put the version here to the point 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.440
 to see the point j are and ready 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.140
 the next thing we're going to do is copy 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.400
 this industrial kraft file 2 and what 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.640
 let's put as we did before 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.840
 normally in the bikes folder if the 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.510
 bikes folder that is at its point of 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.840
 minecraft here we are going to leave and ready 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:08.929
 that is the installation now to open 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.640
 in the game is in this craft industry 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.940
 what we are going to need is to create a 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.200
 new profile here new profile and you 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.980
 we put the name we want for 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:22.040
 example 1.6 point 2 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.939
 industry index and 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.950
 here where it says news version we're going to 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:29.510
 tell him to use we have to open it from 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.189
 new because he has not updated the 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.519
 versions then let's reopen the 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:33.519
 launcher 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:42.810
 we are going to open the lancer now without 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:47.670
 new profile 1.6 point 2 and 1 point 6.2 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:50.970
 Ins index and its version we will give 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.940
 rileys 1.6 points force data nothing or 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.489
 the one that installed us the force and that 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.849
 it's all we give you follow profile then 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.560
 we come here and we tell him to use the one 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.569
 we just created the profile that we just 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.790
 to create that is 1.6 points 2 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.470
 ins and how well he named you 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.910
 put by the name they want and 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:14.209
 just throw play 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:17.050
 normally it does not take almost anything like 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:20.530
 can see it takes too little to load 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:24.520
 but if you put more and more mods 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.710
 it will also delay the load at the time 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.600
 to open the game itself or to pass 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.180
 from 11 to the game as you can see then 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.070
 the mods folder appears and tells us 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.860
 that we already have installed the industrial 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:39.430
 craft now let's do let's try 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.410
 that if it is in vain our create it I 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.480
 I have here one created that is the one of 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.460
 tutorials that is around here that is the 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.200
 I opened it, this is playing the world 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.940
 selected and let's see if we 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.370
 all the textures appear and all the 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.310
 industrial craft things like they can 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.020
 see here are the plants here are 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.090
 the plants 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.780
 believe more look at the machines are by 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:04.090
 here the machines look at this texture that 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.680
 is from the reinforced stone something like this 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.680
 glass texture also appears 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.050
 perfectly is something that there was not 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.880
 worked very well in 1.5 in some 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.690
 sometimes the textures are damaged, not the 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.489
 I found 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.350
 that more here we're going to see about the 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.290
 barrels that we were last time 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.480
 look here is what the barrels of 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.790
 beer and all those pods appear to me 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:29.180
 also the potions the things of those 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:31.370
 of beer that I took or that is the 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:35.449
 the skills he gave me while taking 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:39.070
 beer fatigue strength and slowness and good 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:41.260
 if we can notice that everything is fine 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:44.800
 and look around here something like 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:46.450
 pink what is this is this 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.030
 well this is a texture that year 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:52.240
 ah no no no no look is like a little bus no 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.700
 more but there's no problem there I think 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.900
 it works and it works look if I shot that 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.410
 is the springboard that we made in a 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.840
