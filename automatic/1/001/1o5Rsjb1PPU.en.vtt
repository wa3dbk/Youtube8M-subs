Serato<00:00:37.739> DJ<00:00:38.010> intro<00:00:38.640> which<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.149> really<00:00:39.510> really

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
Serato DJ intro which is really really

Serato DJ intro which is really really
easy<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.079> use<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.649> because<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.760> all<00:00:42.000> those<00:00:42.120> all

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
easy to use and because of all those all

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.420 
easy to use and because of all those all
those<00:00:42.780> features<00:00:43.110> they<00:00:44.010> just<00:00:44.190> kind<00:00:44.370> of

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
those features they just kind of

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.760 
those features they just kind of
combined<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:45.149> produce<00:00:45.440> pretty<00:00:46.440> much<00:00:46.620> the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
combined to produce pretty much the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.410 
combined to produce pretty much the
perfect<00:00:46.920> beginners<00:00:47.430> controller<00:00:47.820> but<00:00:48.329> it

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
perfect beginners controller but it

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.940 
perfect beginners controller but it
wasn't<00:00:48.719> perfect<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.320> reason<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.710> wasn't

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
wasn't perfect and the reason it wasn't

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.650 
wasn't perfect and the reason it wasn't
perfect<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.579> original<00:00:50.760> mixture<00:00:51.270> Pro

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
perfect is that the original mixture Pro

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.150 
perfect is that the original mixture Pro
wasn't<00:00:51.989> designed<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.410> use<00:00:52.649> us<00:00:52.860> through<00:00:53.070> our

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
wasn't designed to use us through our

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.310 
wasn't designed to use us through our
software<00:00:53.520> originally<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:54.930> they<00:00:55.050> had<00:00:55.199> to

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
software originally and so they had to

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.689 
software originally and so they had to
make<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.500> few<00:00:55.710> compromises<00:00:55.920> when<00:00:56.550> they

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
make a few compromises when they

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.310 
make a few compromises when they
re-released<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.360> with<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.629> software<00:00:57.989> and

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
re-released it with that software and

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.799 
re-released it with that software and
also<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.399> wasn't<00:00:59.699> very<00:00:59.969> pretty<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.420> was<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.539> big

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
also it wasn't very pretty it was a big

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.349 
also it wasn't very pretty it was a big
clunky<00:01:01.379> grey<00:01:01.590> box<00:01:01.940> so<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:02.969> know<00:01:03.180> there's

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
clunky grey box so you know there's

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.939 
clunky grey box so you know there's
stuff<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.719> improve<00:01:04.049> on<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.530> they<00:01:04.680> have

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
stuff to improve on and they have

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.760 
stuff to improve on and they have
improved<00:01:05.100> on<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.670> with<00:01:06.360> this<00:01:06.570> business<00:01:07.290> device

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
improved on it with this business device

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.679 
improved on it with this business device
and<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.070> reason<00:01:08.490> they've<00:01:09.060> improved<00:01:09.299> on<00:01:09.570> it

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
and the reason they've improved on it

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.870 
and the reason they've improved on it
you<00:01:09.840> can<00:01:09.990> see<00:01:10.229> already<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.520> looks<00:01:11.729> a

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
you can see already is it looks a

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.270 
you can see already is it looks a
million<00:01:12.090> times<00:01:12.270> better<00:01:12.570> it's<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.110> lot<00:01:13.280> thinner

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
million times better it's a lot thinner

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.820 
million times better it's a lot thinner
it's<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.630> looks<00:01:15.659> more<00:01:16.020> expensive<00:01:16.140> than<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.710> is

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
it's it looks more expensive than it is

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.740 
it's it looks more expensive than it is
it's<00:01:17.040> still<00:01:17.130> made<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.549> plastic<00:01:17.970> but<00:01:18.090> this<00:01:18.240> top

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
it's still made of plastic but this top

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.310 
it's still made of plastic but this top
is<00:01:18.930> brush<00:01:19.490> painted<00:01:20.490> black<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.570> molding

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
is brush painted black and the molding

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.899 
is brush painted black and the molding
underneath<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.100> beveling<00:01:23.520> around<00:01:23.820> the

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
underneath and the beveling around the

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.490 
underneath and the beveling around the
edges<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.299> just<00:01:24.479> looks<00:01:24.689> more<00:01:24.780> expensive<00:01:25.350> than

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
edges it just looks more expensive than

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.280 
edges it just looks more expensive than
it<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.670> that's<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.390> good<00:01:27.540> thing<00:01:27.780> these<00:01:27.930> pads

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
it is and that's a good thing these pads

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.710 
it is and that's a good thing these pads
feel<00:01:28.740> really<00:01:29.189> nice<00:01:29.369> at<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.610> top<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:30.390> kind<00:01:30.659> of

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
feel really nice at the top this kind of

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.149 
feel really nice at the top this kind of
like<00:01:30.840> makes<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.200> feel<00:01:31.409> like<00:01:31.560> an<00:01:31.710> updated

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
like makes it feel like an updated

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.859 
like makes it feel like an updated
controller<00:01:32.549> as<00:01:32.700> well<00:01:32.729> but<00:01:33.360> kind<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.600> under<00:01:33.840> the

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
controller as well but kind of under the

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.710 
controller as well but kind of under the
surface<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.790> mapping<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.240> very<00:01:36.270> very

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
surface the the mapping is very very

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.600 
surface the the mapping is very very
tight<00:01:36.990> now<00:01:37.229> by<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.500> mapping<00:01:37.979> I<00:01:38.100> mean<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.460> way

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
tight now by the mapping I mean the way

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.819 
tight now by the mapping I mean the way
the<00:01:38.790> controls<00:01:39.210> work<00:01:39.869> with<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.170> software<00:01:40.590> it's

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
the controls work with the software it's

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.219 
the controls work with the software it's
really<00:01:41.159> tight<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.610> slick<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.750> job<00:01:43.020> waves

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
really tight and slick and the job waves

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.990 
really tight and slick and the job waves
while<00:01:43.439> they're<00:01:43.649> smaller<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.250> lower<00:01:44.399> profile

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
while they're smaller and lower profile

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.380 
while they're smaller and lower profile
still<00:01:45.770> perform<00:01:46.770> very<00:01:46.979> well<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:48.119> know<00:01:48.240> on

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
still perform very well so you know on

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.359 
still perform very well so you know on
paper<00:01:48.659> it's<00:01:49.049> got<00:01:49.320> it's<00:01:49.799> got<00:01:49.890> all<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.220> stuff

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
paper it's got it's got all the stuff

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.700 
paper it's got it's got all the stuff
that<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.640> original<00:01:50.939> original<00:01:51.299> one<00:01:51.630> had<00:01:51.899> and

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
that the original original one had and

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.560 
that the original original one had and
it<00:01:53.070> improved<00:01:53.549> in<00:01:53.700> some<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.060> areas<00:01:54.329> of<00:01:54.479> the

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
it improved in some of the areas of the

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.120 
it improved in some of the areas of the
original<00:01:54.930> one<00:01:55.110> was<00:01:55.710> lacking

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
original one was lacking

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.280 
original one was lacking
I'm<00:01:56.700> gonna<00:01:57.180> give<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.450> little<00:01:57.630> tour<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.110> what

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
I'm gonna give you a little tour to what

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.080 
I'm gonna give you a little tour to what
it's<00:01:58.439> got<00:01:58.680> now<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.280> can<00:01:59.460> see<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.969> the

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
it's got now so you can see that the

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.370 
it's got now so you can see that the
features<00:02:00.450> on<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.689> now<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.869> inputs<00:02:01.259> and

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
features on it now the inputs and

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.219 
features on it now the inputs and
outputs<00:02:01.469> first<00:02:02.180> microphone<00:02:03.180> two<00:02:03.750> headphones

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
outputs first microphone two headphones

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:04.990 
outputs first microphone two headphones
and<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.649> mark

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
and a mark

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.850 
and a mark
volume<00:02:05.420> here<00:02:05.690> bit<00:02:06.110> weird<00:02:06.380> having<00:02:06.650> on<00:02:06.770> the

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
volume here bit weird having on the

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.279 
volume here bit weird having on the
right-hand<00:02:07.250> side<00:02:07.479> but<00:02:08.479> you<00:02:08.810> know<00:02:08.840> not<00:02:09.229> a

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
right-hand side but you know not a

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.230

deal-breaker<00:02:09.530> around<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:10.429> back<00:02:10.580> is<00:02:11.090> the

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
deal-breaker around the back is the

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.840 
deal-breaker around the back is the
output<00:02:11.420> for<00:02:11.990> the<00:02:12.200> speakers<00:02:12.920> or<00:02:13.100> powered

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850

the USB to plug into your computer and

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.680 
the USB to plug into your computer and
you<00:02:19.550> know<00:02:19.640> that's<00:02:19.850> about<00:02:20.000> it<00:02:20.240> for<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.480> ins<00:02:20.600> and

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
you know that's about it for the ins and

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.980 
you know that's about it for the ins and
outs<00:02:20.870> it's<00:02:21.110> really<00:02:21.350> simple<00:02:22.420> control<00:02:23.420> wise<00:02:23.630> as

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
outs it's really simple control wise as

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.660 
outs it's really simple control wise as
I<00:02:24.200> say<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:24.530> job<00:02:24.709> will<00:02:24.890> still<00:02:25.160> perform<00:02:25.310> nicely

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
I say the job will still perform nicely

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.490 
I say the job will still perform nicely
they've<00:02:26.180> mapped<00:02:26.450> very<00:02:26.930> tightly<00:02:27.200> to<00:02:27.350> the

they've mapped very tightly to the

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.680 
they've mapped very tightly to the

you've<00:02:32.990> got<00:02:33.140> a<00:02:33.170> good<00:02:33.290> click<00:02:33.650> they<00:02:34.070> work<00:02:34.580> when

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
you've got a good click they work when

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.340 
you've got a good click they work when
the<00:02:34.910> mental<00:02:35.209> work<00:02:35.360> is<00:02:35.570> very<00:02:35.780> important<00:02:36.230> of

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
the mental work is very important of

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.620 
the mental work is very important of
course<00:02:36.850> the<00:02:37.850> only<00:02:38.000> thing<00:02:38.209> that<00:02:38.330> gives<00:02:38.480> away

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
course the only thing that gives away

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.900 
course the only thing that gives away
the<00:02:38.810> cheapness<00:02:39.080> really<00:02:39.650> is<00:02:39.860> the<00:02:40.070> top<00:02:40.340> of<00:02:40.670> the

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
the cheapness really is the top of the

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.229 
the cheapness really is the top of the
faders<00:02:41.390> and<00:02:41.600> buttons<00:02:41.989> is<00:02:42.280> knobs<00:02:43.280> a<00:02:43.700> really

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
faders and buttons is knobs a really

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.820 
faders and buttons is knobs a really

cheap plastic cheap plastic knob but it
doesn't<00:02:49.100> matter<00:02:49.280> you<00:02:49.459> know<00:02:49.489> the<00:02:49.700> region<00:02:50.000> that

designers have gone out on a limb a

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.229 
designers have gone out on a limb a
little<00:03:00.410> bit<00:03:00.770> and<00:03:01.100> they<00:03:01.310> basically<00:03:01.520> work<00:03:01.940> quite

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
little bit and they basically work quite

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:03.400 
little bit and they basically work quite
well<00:03:02.270> but<00:03:02.570> they're<00:03:02.720> not<00:03:02.930> what<00:03:03.110> you<00:03:03.230> might

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
well but they're not what you might

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.290 
well but they're not what you might
expect<00:03:03.770> now<00:03:03.980> normally<00:03:04.400> you<00:03:04.520> see<00:03:04.730> performance

cue juggling and stuff and they kind of
you<00:03:11.150> can<00:03:11.299> use<00:03:11.480> them<00:03:11.660> for<00:03:11.690> that<00:03:11.930> but<00:03:12.170> you<00:03:12.620> can't

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
you can use them for that but you can't

lots of functions that have been pushed
into<00:03:36.350> these<00:03:36.620> so<00:03:37.220> they<00:03:37.459> can<00:03:37.610> control<00:03:37.910> effects

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
into these so they can control effects

they can control loops samples and cues

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.990 
they can control loops samples and cues
as<00:03:41.570> well<00:03:41.600> now<00:03:41.959> this<00:03:42.049> is<00:03:42.110> good<00:03:42.470> but<00:03:43.430> it's<00:03:43.610> also<00:03:43.790> a

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
as well now this is good but it's also a

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.880 
as well now this is good but it's also a
bit<00:03:44.209> fiddly<00:03:44.480> you<00:03:44.900> need<00:03:45.079> to<00:03:45.260> you<00:03:45.500> know<00:03:45.620> you<00:03:45.680> need

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
bit fiddly you need to you know you need

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.259 
bit fiddly you need to you know you need
to<00:03:45.920> quickly<00:03:46.160> work<00:03:46.400> out<00:03:46.610> how<00:03:46.760> to<00:03:46.820> get<00:03:47.060> between

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
to quickly work out how to get between

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:51.039 
to quickly work out how to get between
these<00:03:47.510> things<00:03:47.890> the<00:03:48.890> top<00:03:49.190> knobs<00:03:50.000> control<00:03:50.239> the

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
these things the top knobs control the

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.199 
these things the top knobs control the
effects<00:03:51.950> and<00:03:52.250> they're<00:03:52.459> really<00:03:52.610> nicely<00:03:52.880> done

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
effects and they're really nicely done

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:54.520 
effects and they're really nicely done
you<00:03:53.269> get<00:03:53.510> three<00:03:53.750> effects<00:03:54.079> and<00:03:54.290> you<00:03:54.350> get<00:03:54.500> a

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
you get three effects and you get a

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.350 
you get three effects and you get a
beats<00:03:54.829> multiplier<00:03:55.430> which<00:03:55.549> just<00:03:55.790> cycles<00:03:56.239> the

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
beats multiplier which just cycles the

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.630 
beats multiplier which just cycles the
effects<00:03:56.780> as<00:03:56.900> a<00:03:56.930> factor<00:03:57.410> of<00:03:57.560> the<00:03:57.920> BPM<00:03:58.430> of<00:03:58.459> the

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
effects as a factor of the BPM of the

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.520 
effects as a factor of the BPM of the
tune<00:03:58.880> you're<00:03:59.030> listening<00:03:59.360> to<00:03:59.540> and<00:04:00.260> then<00:04:00.380> those

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
tune you're listening to and then those

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.229 
tune you're listening to and then those
pads<00:04:00.860> will<00:04:01.070> be<00:04:01.160> used<00:04:01.340> to<00:04:01.489> switch<00:04:01.730> those<00:04:01.910> on<00:04:02.090> and

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
pads will be used to switch those on and

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.509 
pads will be used to switch those on and

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
I think that's a little bit high but if

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.800 
I think that's a little bit high but if
it<00:05:27.930> drops<00:05:28.170> by<00:05:28.410> say<00:05:28.950> 40<00:05:29.760> $50<00:05:30.360> it<00:05:30.480> becomes

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
it drops by say 40 $50 it becomes

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.320 
it drops by say 40 $50 it becomes
reasonable<00:05:31.320> value<00:05:31.650> very<00:05:32.460> very<00:05:32.730> easy<00:05:32.970> to<00:05:33.180> use

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
reasonable value very very easy to use
