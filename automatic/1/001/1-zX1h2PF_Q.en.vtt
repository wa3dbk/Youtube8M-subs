00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.170 
the seeds first start to sprout and then

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:24.750 
the seeds first start to sprout and then
they<00:00:23.289> actually<00:00:23.680> grow<00:00:23.830> a<00:00:23.920> head<00:00:24.190> of<00:00:24.310> lettuce<00:00:24.340> or

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
start to realize the whole cycle of

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.240 
start to realize the whole cycle of
where<00:00:28.420> the<00:00:28.570> food<00:00:28.810> actually<00:00:29.320> comes<00:00:29.529> from<00:00:29.590> one

where the food actually comes from one
of<00:00:30.310> the<00:00:30.400> easiest<00:00:30.699> ways<00:00:30.970> to<00:00:31.000> do<00:00:31.359> that<00:00:31.510> is<00:00:31.570> to<00:00:31.840> get

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
of the easiest ways to do that is to get

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:34.200 
of the easiest ways to do that is to get
a<00:00:32.769> set<00:00:33.100> of<00:00:33.129> these<00:00:33.280> compressed<00:00:33.760> peat<00:00:34.030> pellets

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
a set of these compressed peat pellets

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.930 
a set of these compressed peat pellets
once<00:00:35.050> you<00:00:35.140> put<00:00:35.470> them<00:00:35.590> into<00:00:35.710> water<00:00:36.010> they<00:00:36.550> swell

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
once you put them into water they swell

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.960 
once you put them into water they swell
up<00:00:36.970> just<00:00:37.420> like<00:00:37.540> that<00:00:37.809> this<00:00:38.770> is<00:00:38.920> the<00:00:39.130> one<00:00:39.850> that

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
up just like that this is the one that

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.430 
up just like that this is the one that
has<00:00:40.030> not<00:00:40.300> had<00:00:40.450> any<00:00:40.660> water<00:00:40.899> on<00:00:40.989> it<00:00:41.230> yet

disturb the key thing is they need as

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:31.440 
disturb the key thing is they need as
much<00:01:29.619> light<00:01:29.950> as<00:01:29.979> possible<00:01:30.189> so<00:01:31.119> a<00:01:31.149> south-facing

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
much light as possible so a south-facing

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.080 
much light as possible so a south-facing
window<00:01:32.169> is<00:01:32.319> good<00:01:32.560> just<00:01:33.249> make<00:01:33.399> sure<00:01:33.429> you<00:01:33.700> rotate

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
window is good just make sure you rotate

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.699 
window is good just make sure you rotate
the<00:01:34.240> plant<00:01:34.509> every<00:01:34.840> couple<00:01:35.049> of<00:01:35.139> days<00:01:35.229> because

00:01:35.699 --> 00:01:35.709 
the plant every couple of days because

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:37.289 
the plant every couple of days because
it<00:01:35.799> will<00:01:35.889> tend<00:01:36.069> to<00:01:36.159> grow<00:01:36.399> towards<00:01:36.969> the<00:01:37.090> light

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
it will tend to grow towards the light

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:39.539 
it will tend to grow towards the light
if<00:01:38.079> you<00:01:38.169> don't<00:01:38.380> have<00:01:38.560> a<00:01:38.590> good<00:01:38.829> window<00:01:39.279> sill

with unobstructed sunshine coming in you

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:43.800
