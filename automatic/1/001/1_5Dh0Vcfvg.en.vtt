00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
again and you play that twice so it

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:24.140 
again and you play that twice so it
sounds<00:03:06.220> like<00:03:06.340> this

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.229 

and<00:03:25.150> then<00:03:25.989> you<00:03:26.140> play<00:03:26.379> the<00:03:26.769> same<00:03:27.190> thing<00:03:27.250> but<00:03:28.000> a

and then you play the same thing but a

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.170 
and then you play the same thing but a
little<00:03:28.569> differently<00:03:29.080> so<00:03:29.849> instead<00:03:30.849> of<00:03:30.909> playing

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
little differently so instead of playing

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:41.390 
little differently so instead of playing
this<00:03:32.879> you<00:03:33.879> have<00:03:34.090> a<00:03:34.530> and<00:03:35.849> then<00:03:36.959> again<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:40.030> a<00:03:40.420> G

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
this you have a and then again the a G

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.490 
this you have a and then again the a G
except<00:03:42.400> the<00:03:43.000> second<00:03:43.480> a<00:03:43.629> and<00:03:44.049> the<00:03:44.349> B<00:03:44.470> are

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
except the second a and the B are

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.750 
except the second a and the B are
thirty-second<00:03:45.280> notes<00:03:45.430> so<00:03:45.700> it<00:03:45.970> goes<00:03:46.120> faster

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
thirty-second notes so it goes faster

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.110 
thirty-second notes so it goes faster
like<00:03:48.760> that<00:03:49.000> and<00:03:49.620> then<00:03:50.620> you<00:03:51.190> continue<00:03:51.579> so<00:03:52.030> you

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
like that and then you continue so you

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.089 
like that and then you continue so you
go<00:03:53.459> and<00:03:54.959> then<00:03:55.959> stead<00:03:56.290> of<00:03:56.349> doing<00:03:56.500> thirty-second

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:57.099 
go and then stead of doing thirty-second

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:59.220 
go and then stead of doing thirty-second
notes<00:03:57.280> you<00:03:57.760> just<00:03:58.060> wait<00:03:58.599> a<00:03:58.629> little<00:03:58.750> bit<00:03:59.019> until

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
notes you just wait a little bit until

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:05.280 
notes you just wait a little bit until
you<00:03:59.470> hit<00:03:59.829> B<00:04:00.579> so<00:04:02.099> and<00:04:03.390> then<00:04:04.390> you<00:04:04.510> do<00:04:04.660> that<00:04:04.870> when

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
you hit B so and then you do that when

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.440 
you hit B so and then you do that when
you<00:04:05.410> play<00:04:05.650> the<00:04:05.829> whole<00:04:05.920> thing<00:04:06.220> so<00:04:06.519> then<00:04:06.790> next

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
you play the whole thing so then next

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.180 
you play the whole thing so then next
time<00:04:07.720> it<00:04:07.870> was<00:04:07.959> like<00:04:08.230> your<00:04:08.440> third<00:04:08.650> time<00:04:08.859> playing

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
time it was like your third time playing

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:20.460 
time it was like your third time playing
it<00:04:09.400> it<00:04:09.519> would<00:04:09.640> sound<00:04:09.730> like<00:04:09.819> this

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:35.910 

and<00:04:21.470> then<00:04:21.950> you<00:04:22.730> play<00:04:22.940> it<00:04:23.120> like<00:04:23.150> this<00:04:33.130> so<00:04:34.780> that's

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:35.920 
and then you play it like this so that's
