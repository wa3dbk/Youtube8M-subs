who<00:00:56.140> are<00:00:56.199> locked<00:00:56.410> up<00:00:56.590> and<00:00:56.769> then<00:00:56.890> Cerberus

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
who are locked up and then Cerberus

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.250 
who are locked up and then Cerberus
troops<00:00:57.609> show<00:00:57.789> up<00:00:57.969> and<00:00:58.239> start<00:00:58.690> shooting<00:00:59.050> at<00:00:59.109> us

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
troops show up and start shooting at us

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.860 
troops show up and start shooting at us
because<00:00:59.379> they're<00:00:59.590> dicks<00:00:59.769> like<00:00:59.949> that<00:01:00.129> I<00:01:00.160> guess

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
because they're dicks like that I guess

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.910 
because they're dicks like that I guess
so<00:01:01.870> of<00:01:01.960> course<00:01:02.079> we<00:01:02.260> have<00:01:02.379> to<00:01:02.440> fight<00:01:02.620> them<00:01:02.800> and

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
so of course we have to fight them and

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.710 
so of course we have to fight them and
then<00:01:03.010> run<00:01:03.160> around<00:01:03.399> in<00:01:03.550> an<00:01:03.730> open<00:01:04.269> cell<00:01:04.480> doors

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
then run around in an open cell doors

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.510 
then run around in an open cell doors
now<00:01:05.230> obviously<00:01:05.680> this<00:01:05.830> is<00:01:05.980> the<00:01:06.100> third<00:01:06.280> game<00:01:06.460> in

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
now obviously this is the third game in

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.460 
now obviously this is the third game in
the<00:01:06.670> Mass<00:01:06.850> Effect<00:01:07.180> series<00:01:07.270> and<00:01:07.840> at<00:01:08.140> this<00:01:08.260> point

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
the Mass Effect series and at this point

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.990 
the Mass Effect series and at this point
if<00:01:08.680> they're<00:01:08.800> not<00:01:08.890> revamping<00:01:09.400> it<00:01:09.520> completely

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
if they're not revamping it completely

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.430 
if they're not revamping it completely
it's<00:01:10.120> going<00:01:10.240> to<00:01:10.300> stay<00:01:10.510> pretty<00:01:10.750> much<00:01:10.930> the<00:01:11.260> same

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
it's going to stay pretty much the same

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.560 
it's going to stay pretty much the same
it's<00:01:11.890> a<00:01:11.980> pretty<00:01:12.640> straightforward<00:01:12.790> sequel

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
it's a pretty straightforward sequel

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.300 
it's a pretty straightforward sequel
however<00:01:14.050> there<00:01:14.260> are<00:01:14.380> a<00:01:14.410> few<00:01:14.650> very<00:01:14.860> noticeable

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
however there are a few very noticeable

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.280 
however there are a few very noticeable
changes<00:01:15.760> one<00:01:16.300> of<00:01:16.390> them<00:01:16.510> is<00:01:16.540> the<00:01:16.720> the<00:01:16.990> squad

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
changes one of them is the the squad

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.010 
changes one of them is the the squad
squad<00:01:17.860> points<00:01:18.220> selection<00:01:19.180> screen<00:01:19.420> before<00:01:19.840> you

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
squad points selection screen before you

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.160 
squad points selection screen before you
start<00:01:20.229> the<00:01:20.320> mission<00:01:21.840> totally<00:01:22.840> different

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
start the mission totally different

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.260 
start the mission totally different
there's<00:01:23.409> a<00:01:23.500> much<00:01:24.100> more<00:01:24.280> complexity<00:01:24.909> going<00:01:25.119> on

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
there's a much more complexity going on

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.160 
there's a much more complexity going on
there<00:01:25.479> and<00:01:25.570> it's<00:01:25.720> simply<00:01:25.900> going<00:01:26.020> to<00:01:26.079> be

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
there and it's simply going to be

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.690 
there and it's simply going to be
something<00:01:26.290> you<00:01:26.590> know<00:01:26.710> take<00:01:27.040> a<00:01:27.070> closer<00:01:27.310> look<00:01:27.430> at

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
something you know take a closer look at

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.120 
something you know take a closer look at
later<00:01:27.880> on<00:01:28.090> also<00:01:28.720> the<00:01:29.290> melee<00:01:29.590> combat<00:01:29.979> we've

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
been we've been teased with this before

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:32.999
