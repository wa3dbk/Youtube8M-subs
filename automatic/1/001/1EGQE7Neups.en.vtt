00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
out to him definitely more important

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.660 
out to him definitely more important
than<00:01:20.149> just<00:01:20.329> the<00:01:20.420> football<00:01:20.719> team<00:01:20.929> so<00:01:21.649> as<00:01:22.100> for

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
than just the football team so as for

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
implications for Dawkins of line we were

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:27.730 
implications for Dawkins of line we were
really<00:01:26.479> hoping<00:01:26.689> that<00:01:26.929> he<00:01:27.140> would<00:01:27.289> take<00:01:27.319> control

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
really hoping that he would take control

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.580 
really hoping that he would take control
of<00:01:27.859> that<00:01:28.069> of<00:01:28.999> that<00:01:29.270> center<00:01:29.719> spot<00:01:29.990> Clemson

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
of that of that center spot Clemson

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.929 
of that of that center spot Clemson
struggled<00:01:30.979> there<00:01:31.069> last<00:01:31.340> year<00:01:31.490> while<00:01:31.700> he<00:01:31.819> was

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
struggled there last year while he was

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:34.359

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.219 
forced to look at as a starting center
so<00:01:58.459> that's<00:01:59.359> when<00:01:59.509> the<00:01:59.630> biggest<00:01:59.899> question

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
so that's when the biggest question

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:01.239 
so that's when the biggest question
marks<00:02:00.439> and<00:02:00.529> definitely<00:02:00.799> something<00:02:01.069> to<00:02:01.130> keep

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:01.249 
marks and definitely something to keep

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:04.120 
marks and definitely something to keep
an<00:02:01.369> eye<00:02:01.490> on<00:02:01.959> the<00:02:02.959> offense<00:02:03.319> is<00:02:03.439> loaded<00:02:04.100> with

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
an eye on the offense is loaded with

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.609 
an eye on the offense is loaded with
firepower<00:02:04.670> especially<00:02:05.240> wide<00:02:05.420> receiver<00:02:05.779> but

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
firepower especially wide receiver but

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.550 
firepower especially wide receiver but
it<00:02:07.310> all<00:02:07.399> starts<00:02:07.639> with<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.789> offensive<00:02:08.060> our<00:02:08.560> 1st

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
it all starts with the offensive our 1st

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.259 
it all starts with the offensive our 1st
questionable<00:02:10.009> as<00:02:10.310> the<00:02:10.429> offensive<00:02:10.759> line<00:02:10.909> was

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
questionable as the offensive line was

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:13.839 
questionable as the offensive line was
most<00:02:11.689> of<00:02:11.840> last<00:02:12.019> season<00:02:12.430> there<00:02:13.430> was<00:02:13.640> no

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
most of last season there was no

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:14.500 
most of last season there was no
question<00:02:14.000> about<00:02:14.330> the

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
defensive line and we talked about this

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.759 
defensive line and we talked about this
before<00:02:16.819> we<00:02:17.030> came<00:02:17.269> on<00:02:17.330> I<00:02:17.810> was<00:02:18.500> going<00:02:18.739> through

before we came on I was going through

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:21.699 
before we came on I was going through
the<00:02:19.010> scouting<00:02:19.430> combine<00:02:19.579> for<00:02:20.239> the<00:02:20.329> NFL<00:02:20.720> and<00:02:21.079> it

the scouting combine for the NFL and it

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.059 
the scouting combine for the NFL and it
seemed<00:02:21.920> like<00:02:21.950> the<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:22.970> Clemson<00:02:23.540> 3d<00:02:24.200> along<00:02:24.920> the

functioning<00:05:14.470> at<00:05:14.620> its<00:05:14.650> maximum<00:05:15.419> so<00:05:16.419> I<00:05:16.450> think

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
functioning at its maximum so I think

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.120 
functioning at its maximum so I think
he's<00:05:16.900> got<00:05:17.050> an<00:05:17.169> opportunity<00:05:17.380> to<00:05:17.800> have<00:05:17.889> another

he's got an opportunity to have another
you<00:05:18.520> know<00:05:18.639> another<00:05:18.850> opportunity<00:05:19.180> have<00:05:19.419> a<00:05:19.510> big

you know another opportunity have a big

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.600 
you know another opportunity have a big
year<00:05:19.900> but<00:05:20.440> if<00:05:20.530> he<00:05:20.620> doesn't<00:05:21.039> I<00:05:21.130> feel<00:05:21.310> a<00:05:21.340> bit<00:05:21.490> more

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:00.779 
ESPN and so between those two the floor
for<00:05:58.210> for<00:05:58.599> how<00:05:58.750> good<00:05:59.460> Clemson's<00:06:00.460> tight<00:06:00.610> end

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:00.789 
for for how good Clemson's tight end

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:03.330 
for for how good Clemson's tight end
play<00:06:00.970> is<00:06:01.030> should<00:06:01.930> be<00:06:02.139> decently<00:06:02.680> high<00:06:02.979> so<00:06:03.310> I

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340 
play is should be decently high so I

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.310 
play is should be decently high so I
think<00:06:03.430> we'll<00:06:03.669> see<00:06:03.849> an<00:06:03.910> improvement<00:06:04.169> even<00:06:05.169> if

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:05.320 
think we'll see an improvement even if

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.290 
think we'll see an improvement even if
