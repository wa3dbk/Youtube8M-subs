 Hello everyone, Vlad again today 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.049
 I'm reviewing windows 7 which 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.660
 supported on ipod touch and iphone 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.179
 also at the end I will explain in detail how her 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.580
 install has on winterboard she 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.470
 I would not want to work 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.810
 notice the excellent graphics hd 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.390
 also the desktop is made just like 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.550
 hereby Vilnius 7 clicking on the computer 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.840
 you can understand that all your applications 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:33.750
 divided into folders for example in the folder abs 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.200
 all your applications are also in 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.629

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.149

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.129
 the color of your windows 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:59.039
 Well, for example, let's make green here 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:02.090
 so it will look like something just 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:05.280
 all right to painting windows 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.510

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.979
 for example, mail 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:18.259

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:23.780
