00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.320
 in this mini tutorial I will teach you to 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.200
 use the xbox command that we have 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.420
 configured before with bluetooth usb 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.450
 center today to use it with any 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.039
 touch screen game the first thing that 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.160
 we have to do is open the application 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.810
 original usb bluetooth center we have 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.279
 here the selected command and we have to 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.949
 give this little button that you will have in 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.600
 ok and this is going to take us to the market 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:29.150
 to download an an add-on that 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.310
 we need once this is done 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.989
 installed here we will appear these 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.839
 two buttons by edith m 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.089
 it says that tweet edith m is to open 

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:40.280
 edit mode and your edit that is 

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:41.960
 to save the changes is worth then 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.239
 these two buttons you have to map the a 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.609
 a control button that I have mapped 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.950
 then to the left joystick and 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:51.140
 right joystick 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.880
 we leave the application with the button 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.270
 back is to say that we stay here 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.940
 open in the notification bar and 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.390
 we execute 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.570
 the add-on that we have downloaded 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.890
 that side that allows us to convert 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.470
 the pulsations of the screen in 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.659
 buttons then when I 'm in this 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.780
 open press the touch button edith 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.280
 my screen is set for us 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.659
 add buttons to this screen as 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.460
 we simply hold the button 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.470
 in the very important command press 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.600
 always first the button on the remote and 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.119
 then we press the screen and the button 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.290
 appears to eliminate it for equal 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.990
 we keep pressing the button on the remote 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.450
 we touch the screen for about 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.920
 seconds and disappears when we add 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.900
 a joystick is a bit different 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.880
 because we keep pressed and explains in 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.950
 an address we press and the 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.649
 joystick now by pressing the joystick 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.020
 up and down we expand we reduce its 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:46.000
 area of action 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.159
 and if we keep pressing the joystick and 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.770
 we press the touch screen the textile is 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.600
 moves becomes a very useful slider 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.869
 to move the camera in the games of 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.869
 action 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.720
 we keep pressed we play the rustic 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.500
 and so we eliminated it 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.640
 well what I 'm going to do is open max 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.130
 payne 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.140
 open the settings screen of the 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.660
 controls and I will try to create some 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.790
 controls for max payne if I do not get 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.280
 Well then I'll use one more game 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.200
 simple 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.180
 I've already proven that you can create 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.620
 controls easily then we are in 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.680
 the controls settings screen 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.540
 of max payne 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.280
 press to open the mode of 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.680
 edition 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:37.319
 and well, we keep pressing the 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.319
 left witness we touch in this area 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.180
 settings 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.820
 we touch the right district and press 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.820
 in this area 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:58.670
 this joystick we must convert it 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.380
 in a stick line to let us move 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.550
 the camera 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:06.640
 and now the start button 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:09.069
 we are going to map it there 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.490
 the select button for example I'm going to 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.490
 stick there 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.870
 cow 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.380
 the firing button 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.480
 and for example 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.690
 and others are 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.690
 there 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:38.450
 we keep the changes 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.450
 and in principle it should be 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.710
 of the game 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.719
 as we see here we are already doing 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.560
 with chairs with the control but good for 

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:04.650
 these menus we move better 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:09.410
 touching on the screen and let's see what 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.410
 provided such in command 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.890
 well then after jumping the video as 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.780
 you can see it detects me perfectly 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.889
 we rotate the camera we look good for the 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.780
 sides 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.780
 there is detecting the pulsation 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.230
 as we see it works quite well 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:51.040
 is an action game that is not that either 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:54.540
 it is very easy to play on the mobile 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:58.110
 but the important thing is the command is 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.110
 perfectly mapping 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.760
 we have access to all buttons 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.480
 bullet time 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.480
 the shot 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:14.660
 the jump 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.660
 pause 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.979
 what else can you do then good 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:31.420
 so you can see it in one more game 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.420
 simple let's run the play 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.770
 everything to start 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.770
 new game ok 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.280
 just like before we opened the mode of 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.500
 edition 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.950
 we are going to erase everything we have created 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.950
 before 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.879
 you see we want to erase in a little while 

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:19.939
 ok let's come to the options 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:26.629
 this game has the option to do the 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:29.150
 transparent gamepad to me serves me to 

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:31.540
 can edit the command then we can 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:34.930
 sad and as before 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:36.880
 we click there and also this game we 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:40.140
 let's move the controls a bit 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.140
 that is configured very well 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:46.570
 there we have the joystick in created us 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.570
 we like the size 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.990
 action button 

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:03.760
 is high 

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:03.760
 healing button and in the state we put 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:09.849
 the download button we save and you're 

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.849
 working 

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:21.320
 now to make the curl we come 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:25.330
 to easy options 

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.330
 we do everything transparent 

00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:34.369
 and now we see that you can play the 

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:36.619
 full screen with the knob and the 

00:07:34.369 --> 00:07:38.989
 true is that a complex game like max 

00:07:36.619 --> 00:07:41.539
 payne and do not object ah well good is mapped 

00:07:38.989 --> 00:07:44.059
 but they are not games that are thought 

00:07:41.539 --> 00:07:45.739
 for mobile but this type of games with 

00:07:44.059 --> 00:07:48.699
 the command are played pretty pretty 

00:07:45.739 --> 00:07:51.879
 well even this kind of movements 

00:07:48.699 --> 00:07:54.499
 that are done with double pulsation is 

00:07:51.879 --> 00:07:56.860
 make them with the complicated screen with 

00:07:54.499 --> 00:07:56.860
 the command 

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:03.340
 I hope you liked this video and 

00:08:00.289 --> 00:08:03.340
 that you have found useful
