00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
that I revamp to make it look like a

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.859

see<00:00:26.469> it<00:00:26.619> in<00:00:26.860> there<00:00:27.550> it<00:00:27.730> looks<00:00:27.879> pretty<00:00:28.059> good<00:00:28.270> I

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:28.329 
see it in there it looks pretty good I

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:31.650 
see it in there it looks pretty good I
thought<00:00:29.730> first<00:00:30.730> you<00:00:30.910> start<00:00:31.090> out<00:00:31.270> with<00:00:31.360> a<00:00:31.419> blue

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:31.660 
thought first you start out with a blue

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.810 
thought first you start out with a blue
sign<00:00:31.930> blue<00:00:32.320> background<00:00:32.829> that's<00:00:33.100> mostly<00:00:33.640> how

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
sign blue background that's mostly how

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.840 
sign blue background that's mostly how
all<00:00:34.030> of<00:00:34.059> them<00:00:34.360> go<00:00:34.539> then<00:00:35.200> what<00:00:35.500> you<00:00:35.649> do<00:00:35.800> is<00:00:36.039> you

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
all of them go then what you do is you

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.639 
all of them go then what you do is you
get<00:00:37.000> a<00:00:37.030> full<00:00:37.270> circle<00:00:37.600> and<00:00:37.870> you<00:00:37.989> put<00:00:38.199> it<00:00:38.320> right

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:38.649 
get a full circle and you put it right

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:43.050 
get a full circle and you put it right
in<00:00:38.860> the<00:00:38.980> middle<00:00:39.570> type<00:00:40.570> deal<00:00:40.840> and<00:00:41.079> then<00:00:42.070> wait

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.060 
in the middle type deal and then wait

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.490 
in the middle type deal and then wait
like<00:00:43.420> the<00:00:43.660> only<00:00:43.750> reason<00:00:43.870> it<00:00:44.170> looks<00:00:44.260> like<00:00:44.470> a

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
like the only reason it looks like a

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.069 
like the only reason it looks like a
half<00:00:44.710> circles<00:00:45.190> because<00:00:45.370> I<00:00:45.640> put<00:00:45.850> another<00:00:46.300> Blue

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
half circles because I put another Blue

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.860 
half circles because I put another Blue
Square<00:00:47.410> and<00:00:47.770> I<00:00:48.310> covered<00:00:48.640> it<00:00:48.850> up<00:00:48.970> see<00:00:49.329> it<00:00:49.690> looks

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
Square and I covered it up see it looks

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.340 
Square and I covered it up see it looks
like<00:00:49.960> that<00:00:50.350> but<00:00:50.649> then<00:00:50.800> you<00:00:50.920> put<00:00:51.310> this<00:00:51.670> over<00:00:52.030> it

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
like that but then you put this over it

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.620 
like that but then you put this over it
just<00:00:53.350> like<00:00:53.530> so<00:00:53.890> you<00:00:54.730> can<00:00:54.850> even<00:00:55.000> turn<00:00:55.300> it<00:00:55.510> at

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:55.630 
just like so you can even turn it at

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.370 
just like so you can even turn it at
your<00:00:55.840> will<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:57.520> so<00:00:58.300> then<00:00:58.480> you<00:00:58.600> get<00:00:58.960> the<00:00:59.140> best

00:00:59.370 --> 00:00:59.380 
your will and so then you get the best

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.500 
your will and so then you get the best
semi<00:01:00.070> circle<00:01:00.579> for<00:01:00.760> the<00:01:00.790> wheel<00:01:01.090> that<00:01:01.329> you

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
semi circle for the wheel that you

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:09.060 
semi circle for the wheel that you
possibly<00:01:01.930> can<00:01:02.559> and<00:01:02.940> then<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:07.119> then<00:01:07.899> lines<00:01:08.619> for

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
possibly can and then and then lines for

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.249 
possibly can and then and then lines for
the<00:01:09.100> legs<00:01:09.189> just<00:01:09.729> straight<00:01:10.060> lines<00:01:10.329> just<00:01:10.689> second

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
the legs just straight lines just second

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:13.590 
the legs just straight lines just second
lieutenant<00:01:11.680> lines<00:01:11.860> and<00:01:12.219> then<00:01:13.179> you<00:01:13.389> got<00:01:13.569> a

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600
