00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:06.930
 and 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.520
 equal to all the boy come simple 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.530
 urban fruits for them is that this 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.420
 action remains to look for a substitute for a 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.220
 pokémon that is very used very seen in 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.139
 the goal game but it does not mean that the 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.150
 substitute is going to be better than pokémon 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.070
 that is very seen very used are only 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.020
 options so you can do your 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.910
 team a little more original and this 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.890
 the substitute will be for ferro 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.080
 author a pokémon that has been seen since 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.029
 a long time ago already like a little 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.279
 very young user and very used because it is a 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.170
 very excellent defensive tank 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.659
 as it even holds pretty attacks 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.510
 While special - but holds enough 

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:41.610
 well their states are the following ps 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.190
 74 to be a tank I have to admit 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.739
 that does not have many ps attack 94 of 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.729
 cent physical attack to be a tank 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.159
 defensive physical defense 131 speed 

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:54.479
 20 super super slow e to attack in 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:56.369
 second place be because it is in space 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:59.449
 weird or the rival pokemon is paralyzed 

00:00:56.369 --> 00:01:02.820
 special attack 54 and special defense 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.379
 116 one pass this pokemon is plant 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.330
 to zero and how good they are are the 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.789
 weaknesses that you only have for two to 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.100
 fight and for four to games this does 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:13.200
 an excellent tank as I said 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.049
 because it has few weaknesses and over 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.729
 the work the role the function that is the 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.350
 always this pokemon is usually from 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.360
 wear either paralyzes or well puts 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.940
 traps rocks and simply trainers 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.860
 with protection is discovered and makes 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.780
 the winners advance one turn after 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.490
 put another type of wear attacks 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.409
 which you want and is usually seen with 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.240
 whiplash and spin nador ball well 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.250
 Protection or trap rocks of hillsides 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.659
 Protection and spin ball but fat you 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.670
 it removes more life the less speed 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.350
 this one compares with the rival therefore 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.360
 it's a pokémon that the function that has 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.340
 It is always to wear and logically 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.259
 hold on to the physical pokemon not 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.149
 make tank because it condemns hard and 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.710
 with steel tip life if they touch it 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.569
 they are taking away life of givers advance 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.460
 they are healing ps they put him usually 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:55.440
 put the object remains so that over 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.090
 have double shift and healing 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.539
 it increases is a being you do a protection 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.039
 cure trainers plus more more the remains 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:03.899
 more if they touch you later in the next 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:06.179
 turn with steel tip can do 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.250
 effect therefore it is a very pokémon 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:10.530
 hard to find a substitute myself 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.569
 week happened two pokemon that can 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.790
 do the same function as that of 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.440
 wear are very good pokemon and can 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.220
 do not logically work tank 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.250
 Excellent 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.040
 so the first substitute that I choose 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.250
 to make it tone and it's an option I repeat 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.070
 is an option is to create and read this 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.740
 Pokemon rock plant is differentiated by 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.840
 a single type of ferro tony has 686 a 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.150
 little more than ferro tomato than 81 a 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.750
 little less does not happen anything defense 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.040
 in 97 - logically but speed 43 not 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.830
 It gives absolutely the same it looks a lot like 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.470
 ferro ton is slow special attack 81 and 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.940
 then official 107 if you look at ps 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.740
 defense and defense fiction you have them 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.330
 has them high that what interests 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.190
 a tank has the collector skill 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.720
 flat after water attacks are not 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.240
 effective against him but they raise him the 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.550
 special attack and function and the 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.830
 Claudio's work is still very much 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.810
 similar to Ferro author does not have 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.160
 burns but he does have the traps 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.900
 rocks as said team that can put 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.130
 and can recover with attacks from 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.720
 recovery does not have to nad now but 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.480
 can learn recovery learn 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.590
 won and above has a reserve which 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.080
 the special defense and the 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.550
 physical defense by one this can do 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.990
 that creates deal and is a pokémon that 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.120
 endure a lot in the field of 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.610
 battle together with recovery I won 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.630
 and reserve and then you put remains on it is a 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.270
 pokémon that is very 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.550
 of knocking down as it is rotor faith kills by 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.290
 wear at the end the pokemon falls because 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.940
 can not end up with credit of what 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.830
 defensive that you get to establish in 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.330
 the battlefield logically the 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.010
 weaknesses are a little higher as 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.100
 has fight for 2 like ferrero 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.650
 tone but has a bug by 2 to 0 by 2 and 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.780
 ice for 2 does not have any for 4 but 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.060
 yes you have enough for 2 you have 4 for 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.860
 2 but it is an option per platoon of 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.750
 agreement and I came up with another 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.730
 substitute that could do it quite 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.010
 well like the ace ferro tone that 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:00.870
 it's so grow and first let's go over it 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:03.150
 its stands ps 100 a bestiality for 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.120
 be a perfect defensive tank up 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.730
 that 100 greater than it was broken defense 125 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.230
 almost equal 50 speed follows 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.990
 being slow just like it creates dic efe 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.600
 rotor and attacks demanded 110 beats 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:18.209
 both but has a bad thing the 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.730
 special defense 50 up here all 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.770
 March well is type plant does not have 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.510
 they share no more type to be only 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.000
 Plant type has different weaknesses 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.220
 that are flying by two poison for two 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.120
 bug by two fire by two and diego by 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.460
 two shares 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.470
 some with credit but if you look at the 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.660
 fight is no longer for two agree then 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.639
 is to be just type plant the skills 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.979
 it has a very, very good 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:42.449
 what is ability skill regeneration 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:44.699
 special what it does is that when 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:46.169
 changes and sato and grow will take part 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:49.199
 of your soft fish you can always 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:51.600
 have quite high life function and 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:54.479
 the role I repeat is the same as ferro 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.340
 author and that creel and wear 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:58.530
 ferro button learns trap rocks 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.090
 winners and this pokemon learns 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.310
 Coach is the same and then you learn 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.990
 sleeping sickness paralyze as they rub 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.760
 learning to turn this pokemon also 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.520
 and over learn a very curious thing 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.810
 I like a lot is disarmament ago 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.490
 that such a group can leave the field of 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.600
 battle throws the winners and then 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.789
 used a disarmament to take away the 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.530
 object to the rivals this the truth that 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:18.690
 disarmament is an attack that hurts a lot 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.370
 a rival because it annoys the object and 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.740
 the objects are very interesting field of 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.350
 battle as you already know also learn 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.539
 I won as he does every day this 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:30.240
 pokemon is often used a lot of 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:31.860
 physical tank they put all the sets in 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.630
 life and in physical defense or of the 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.210
 special defense that the only bad thing that 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:38.100
 and they endure shock has Inpres 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.960
 before because the fight is not over 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.550
 two is by one and usually in attack 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.870
 is more physical strong is an earthquake that 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.400
 is not very effective havana shock either 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.770
 modified against the Saturday by the 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.870
 the fighters do not fight either 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.849
 makes a pokemon excelentísimo of 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.580
 physical tank and over with train you adore 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:55.440
 I won for analysis and disarming the 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.479
 can bind a lot and the object 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.669
 logically just like it creates dic efe 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:01.229
 rotor rests guys this one yes 2 minute 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:03.539
 for this week this time he has played 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:05.220
 it was a mouse and I've given you two options already 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:07.470
 you know there are many more but for 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.150
 me these two I know they meet the same 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.860
 function and I know they're going to do great 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.570
 on the battlefield and I will not take 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.620
 from less to ferro author pro - is a 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.300
 option guys so we hope has 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.009
 liked very much when a very strong 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.570
 arms that thank you very much for being 

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:20.570
 ciao me every day
