00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:38.390
 Hello everyone today review plugs in 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.770
 company audio-technica you terrain is not 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.040
 our review today 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.530
 The plug from the company audio-technica is 3 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.840
 driver and armature headphones have 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.320
 the normal version is the pro version in this one 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.840
 we have a case 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.940
 pro version but do not respond accordingly 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.550
 sound it goes like a professional but 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.900
 different sound accuracy with hernia 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.149
 neighbor liners 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.530
 medium small large silicone and 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:07.630
 he started out as such that it does not 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:09.410
 you know net boobs have lost honor 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.680
 headphone case 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:15.380
 all the law in the case choose yourself 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:21.820
 headphones like this kind of carry 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:25.670
 box and all + and all packaging is very 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:29.210
 very very simple if against type 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.800
 bits or bowers wilkins who is absolutely 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.590
 ordinary packaging significantly significantly 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.580
 cheaper headphone wire prices simple 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.429
 cheap 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.709
 thin in any of a thousand rubles 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:42.770
 compartment easily tangled mouth lousy 

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:46.700
 socket too distressing wire cheap for 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:49.200
 friction creates noise 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.710
 question by gender 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:57.219
 break in you can blame it on another 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:02:00.070
 change over 20,000 scientifically ergonomic 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:03.460
 Headphones are great they do not fall out 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.890
 Ingush easily kept included in person in 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.619
 my ears and little earbuds are fine 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.420
 sat and medium and large 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.209
 regardless of the size of some extent already 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.250
 some more but all sit beautiful 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.129
 at different positions of the right to dress as 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.950
 not up then the wire can either not normally 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:23.140
 use either behind the ear weight and pressure 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.250
 1 less due to cheeks even easier and easier 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.110
 they sit in the ears 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.930
 sandu what about sound sound 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.610
 fine but it is after warming up then when 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.500
 the first turn were not complete not 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.959
 warmed up and when first turned on 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.170
 the sound was absolutely horrible linear pile 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.970
 figurative linear in porridge and illegible 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.400
 and just a lot of noise and 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.799
 distortion literally for 1 hour sound 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.650
 then progress has changed dramatically 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:50.019
 slowed down from 1 50 that sound harlin 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.680
 changed smoothly change appeared in baas 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:55.660
 Panorama detail appeared but 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.760
 constantly did not go up not frequency 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.859
 here is an unpleasant sound somewhere at 3 6 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.340
 kilohertz yesterday and I was worried 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:05.139
 flawed bass detail of the panorama 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.329
 particular problem was at high frequencies 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:08.980
 that is, there were very unpleasant straight 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.900
 tell me 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.730
 further progress from 50 to 100 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.549
 hours longer already less 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.459
 the cardinal became more hear he all 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:20.739
 Equal also does not stand out but he already 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.290
 one that should be the middle 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.519
 perfectly clears out improved panorama 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.440
 and top 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.870
 become normally susceptible 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.480
 relative to other plugs of the most 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.459
 decent gag myself so far I've heard 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.920
 they sound great at all 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:39.069
 It sounds great female vocals 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.260
 the lesson sounds so good everyones guitar 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.239
 now in detail any music where 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.060
 required detail distinguishes these 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.360
 headphones are great for something 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.329
 electronic 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.920
 it sounds great too but you are not here 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:53.109
 which you will expect 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.720
 just a very responsive shot others 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:04:06.489
 but ulefone this sleepy weak less 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:09.370
 than the average price of headphones 20,000 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.180
 maybe it's expensive for but suitable for 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.970
 monitoring 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.069
 working with sound untruth on top 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:18.549
 parts they perfectly teach on hain't 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:21.970
 iPods on the same a and bass on the off at x3 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.410
 Excellent on the iPhone, they sound clean exactly 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.660
 by iphone 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.940
 well, in general the other is to miss everything not 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.479
 the details are missing the sound itself 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:35.400
 what can ipod iphone give out 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:35.400
 show but no more in general, all
