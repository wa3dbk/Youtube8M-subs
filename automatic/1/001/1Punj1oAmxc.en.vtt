they also announced a ultra fast
wireless<00:02:49.200> for<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:49.799> iPhone<00:02:50.100> and<00:02:50.390> LTE<00:02:51.390> finally

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
wireless for the iPhone and LTE finally

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.170 
wireless for the iPhone and LTE finally
like<00:02:52.440> yak<00:02:52.680> but<00:02:52.920> read<00:02:53.190> a<00:02:53.220> new<00:02:53.489> iPhone<00:02:53.910> features

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
like yak but read a new iPhone features

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.699 
like yak but read a new iPhone features
LTE<00:02:55.010> so<00:02:56.010> 4G<00:02:56.670> LTE<00:02:56.910> is<00:02:57.269> finally<00:02:58.110> coming<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:58.590> the

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
LTE so 4G LTE is finally coming to the

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.720 
LTE so 4G LTE is finally coming to the
iphone<00:02:58.830> that's<00:02:59.720> that's<00:03:00.720> 100<00:03:01.680> megabytes<00:03:02.400> per

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
iphone that's that's 100 megabytes per

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.059 
iphone that's that's 100 megabytes per
second<00:03:03.269> of<00:03:03.450> maximum<00:03:03.989> download<00:03:04.200> speeds<00:03:04.650> which

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
second of maximum download speeds which

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.330 
second of maximum download speeds which
is<00:03:05.730> insane<00:03:06.299> and<00:03:06.569> also<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:07.709> iphone<00:03:08.040> five<00:03:08.310> comes

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
is insane and also the iphone five comes

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.440 
is insane and also the iphone five comes
with<00:03:09.000> this<00:03:09.180> a6<00:03:09.959> cpu<00:03:10.620> we<00:03:11.250> still<00:03:11.880> don't<00:03:12.120> know<00:03:12.180> if

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
with this a6 cpu we still don't know if

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.599 
with this a6 cpu we still don't know if
this<00:03:12.660> is<00:03:12.720> a<00:03:12.870> quad-core<00:03:13.200> cpu<00:03:14.070> what<00:03:14.220> I<00:03:14.250> believe

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
this is a quad-core cpu what I believe

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.930 
this is a quad-core cpu what I believe
it<00:03:14.760> is<00:03:14.790> since<00:03:15.750> so<00:03:15.989> it<00:03:16.170> has<00:03:16.350> two<00:03:16.739> times<00:03:17.130> faster

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
it is since so it has two times faster

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.509 
it is since so it has two times faster
performance<00:03:18.780> and<00:03:19.470> two<00:03:19.709> times<00:03:20.010> faster

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
performance and two times faster

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.390 
performance and two times faster

also<00:03:31.170> the<00:03:31.530> battery<00:03:31.890> has<00:03:32.010> been<00:03:32.190> improved<00:03:32.760> by<00:03:32.940> a

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
also the battery has been improved by a

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.990 
also the battery has been improved by a
lot<00:03:33.569> as<00:03:33.870> you<00:03:34.079> can<00:03:34.200> see<00:03:34.380> from<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.910> from<00:03:35.910> the

even<00:04:20.790> better<00:04:20.940> than<00:04:21.209> the<00:04:21.269> iphone<00:04:21.390> 4s<00:04:22.019> you<00:04:22.650> can

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
even better than the iphone 4s you can

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.510 
even better than the iphone 4s you can
also<00:04:23.100> share<00:04:23.840> photostream<00:04:24.840> cell<00:04:25.140> you<00:04:26.130> now<00:04:26.250> have

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
also share photostream cell you now have

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.580 
also share photostream cell you now have
a<00:04:26.550> panorama<00:04:27.210> mode<00:04:27.480> which<00:04:27.930> lets<00:04:28.350> you<00:04:28.440> take

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
a panorama mode which lets you take

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.280 
a panorama mode which lets you take

mega pixels in size which is insane and

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.810 
mega pixels in size which is insane and
you<00:04:34.320> can<00:04:34.470> finally<00:04:34.710> take<00:04:35.070> photos<00:04:35.490> while

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
you can finally take photos while

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.750 
you can finally take photos while
recording<00:04:36.480> the<00:04:36.690> video<00:04:36.780> and<00:04:37.200> we<00:04:38.160> finally<00:04:38.400> have

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
recording the video and we finally have

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.180 
recording the video and we finally have
