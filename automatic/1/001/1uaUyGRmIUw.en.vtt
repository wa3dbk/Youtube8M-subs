00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.060
 Yes 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:09.050
 It is a silken 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.850
 And flagship is what is thought city Okuno 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:15.160
 left 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:18.700
 It has been on the right side since now 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.530
 First of all, docking 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:25.850
 Let's get on the wing properly 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:27.400
 There are times when you or hooked to it is when you thorough tree Well Arakata 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.470
 Oh dear 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:35.290
 I put it on 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:37.560
 Because this one is fixed well, we make use of this fixed situation 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.560
 Hey 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:45.480
 I think it is expected to say flat 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:48.660
 I would like to get in touch, but in this kind of situation, if I touch it with my hand 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.230
 It may be hooked 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.230
 Do this 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.719
 I will blow 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.940
 I wonder if it comes to life 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.600
 a 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:05.140
 If you get on it 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.140
 further 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:14.410
 If it blows in the wind , I will try to enter beautifully 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.410
 Let's do it 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.450
 2 minutes to Miyanoue 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.130
 f 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.130
 enter 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.550
 Lightly fixed 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.550
 What does it mean yeah 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.690
 Mr. Kana um 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.740
 It is kind 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.740
 do not pull q 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.290
 Because it puts is called a positive bone but will be something basic 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.340
 And 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.140
 I wonder how 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.640
 Yes 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.640
 First of all keep in the middle 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:33.450
 Both sides lightly not not it also this it is to the outside and that force full Kyukkyu' 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.989
 is 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.989
 It is around 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.879
 It is better before 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.620
 As much as possible 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:55.470
 Because it is paper taper Well 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.470
 I think it will be crowded if you hold back 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:24.480
 I also check the length of the film whether there is no unpainted sealer . 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.580
 Oh, let's see if there is this time 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.230
 So you want to 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:31.590
 It is okay to make more white flags 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.590
 However 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:38.440
 With when the paint started 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.130
 Hakkei is included 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.130
 It is here 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.610
 eh 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.049
 When it appeared to Fu that become a little good catcher 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.049
 Oh dear 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.949
 Please try blowing a little like this 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.139
 Here you will notice a little 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.740
 When 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:34.090
 It's bloated, but it's sign language 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.090
 It is a direction make myself understood of Se 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.600
 Taking Well chopper towards here 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:43.540
 It feels like this 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.540
 I think the same 4 steps as stretching 

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:34.309

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:40.980

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:45.190
 Oh dear 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:47.050
 My hand is too light 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.770
 I thought 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:52.509
 Is growing 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.509
 I will be familiar with it 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.889
 And r part is 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.810
 I will 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:09.620
 It is up to the inside 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.620
 Like this 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.200
 Let's check a little 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.550
 It is such a place 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:24.479
 In such Fu 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:30.680
 Please prepare well 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.180
