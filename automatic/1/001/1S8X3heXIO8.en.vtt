the ears and kind of comb it so it's in

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.799 
the ears and kind of comb it so it's in
place<00:00:38.000> you're<00:00:39.000> going<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.239> divide<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.719> into

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
place you're going to divide it into

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.889 
place you're going to divide it into
three<00:00:40.290> sections<00:00:42.500> so<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.590> have<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.780> section<00:00:45.780> on

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
three sections so you have a section on

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.330 
three sections so you have a section on
the<00:00:45.989> left<00:00:46.170> section<00:00:46.559> in<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.860> middle<00:00:47.100> and

the left section in the middle and

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.520 
the left section in the middle and
section<00:00:47.700> on<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.879> right<00:00:48.110> now<00:00:49.110> you're<00:00:49.350> going<00:00:49.440> to

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
section on the right now you're going to

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.709 
section on the right now you're going to
take<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:50.430> left<00:00:50.670> piece<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.270> cross<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.690> over

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
take the left piece and cross it over

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.580 
take the left piece and cross it over
that<00:00:52.170> middle<00:00:52.500> piece<00:00:53.989> so<00:00:54.989> now<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.230> still<00:00:55.559> have

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
that middle piece so now you still have

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.810 
that middle piece so now you still have
three<00:00:56.039> sections<00:00:56.570> left<00:00:57.570> center<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.500> right<00:00:58.820> but
