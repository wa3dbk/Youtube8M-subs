00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
to gear sticks yep it's split so you can

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.910 
to gear sticks yep it's split so you can
run<00:02:18.370> one<00:02:18.580> engine<00:02:18.909> if<00:02:19.000> you<00:02:19.090> want<00:02:19.299> and<00:02:19.720> also<00:02:20.349> if

you<00:02:21.400> do<00:02:21.580> miss<00:02:21.819> a<00:02:21.849> gear<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:24.790> time<00:02:25.030> she<00:02:25.239> tend<00:02:25.480> to

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
you do miss a gear the time she tend to

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.619 
you do miss a gear the time she tend to
miss<00:02:25.780> gears<00:02:26.049> are<00:02:26.500> when<00:02:27.010> you're<00:02:27.370> driving<00:02:28.239> quite

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
miss gears are when you're driving quite

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.610 
miss gears are when you're driving quite
slowly<00:02:28.989> and<00:02:29.260> traffic<00:02:30.959> you<00:02:31.959> can<00:02:32.170> just<00:02:32.410> go

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
slowly and traffic you can just go

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.860 
slowly and traffic you can just go
between<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.250> ear<00:02:33.549> and<00:02:33.760> just<00:02:33.970> one<00:02:34.269> won't

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
between the ear and just one won't

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.470 
between the ear and just one won't
change<00:02:35.430> it's<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.519> same<00:02:36.700> on<00:02:36.730> a<00:02:36.849> motorbike<00:02:37.209> you

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
change it's the same on a motorbike you

change it's the same on a motorbike you
can<00:02:37.629> miss<00:02:37.810> gears<00:02:38.049> riding<00:02:38.890> a<00:02:38.950> motorbike<00:02:39.250> so<00:02:40.120> if

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
can miss gears riding a motorbike so if

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.300 
can miss gears riding a motorbike so if
you<00:02:40.390> miss<00:02:40.540> a<00:02:40.569> gear<00:02:40.870> you'll<00:02:41.349> certain<00:02:41.769> period

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
you miss a gear you'll certain period

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.330 
you miss a gear you'll certain period
because<00:02:42.910> the<00:02:43.030> engine<00:02:43.390> located<00:02:44.260> change<00:02:44.680> so<00:02:45.280> you

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
because the engine located change so you

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.580 
because the engine located change so you
do<00:02:45.640> is<00:02:45.819> look<00:02:45.970> at<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.150> rev<00:02:46.329> counter<00:02:46.360> then<00:02:47.349> just

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
do is look at the rev counter then just

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.699 
do is look at the rev counter then just
catch<00:02:47.799> up<00:02:48.069> to<00:02:49.000> start<00:02:49.299> with<00:02:49.540> I<00:02:49.870> would<00:02:50.349> recommend

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
catch up to start with I would recommend

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.780 
catch up to start with I would recommend
you<00:02:51.069> just<00:02:51.280> take<00:02:51.940> everything<00:02:52.090> to<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.599> top<00:02:52.870> gear

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
you just take everything to the top gear

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.400 
you just take everything to the top gear
and<00:02:54.790> get<00:02:54.879> both<00:02:55.120> into<00:02:55.420> sixth<00:02:55.750> gear<00:02:55.780> and<00:02:56.109> then<00:02:56.230> go

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
and get both into sixth gear and then go

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.180 
and get both into sixth gear and then go
down<00:02:56.650> okay<00:02:57.190> to<00:02:57.549> get<00:02:57.730> back<00:02:57.970> in<00:02:58.150> sync<00:02:58.980> this<00:02:59.980> one

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
down okay to get back in sync this one

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.300 
down okay to get back in sync this one
here<00:03:00.489> is<00:03:00.519> the<00:03:00.970> reverse<00:03:01.390> gear<00:03:01.750> box<00:03:02.129> so<00:03:03.129> the

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
here is the reverse gear box so the

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.449 
here is the reverse gear box so the
transfer<00:03:03.790> box<00:03:04.000> has<00:03:04.299> reverse<00:03:04.660> gear<00:03:05.019> it's<00:03:05.200> wrong

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
transfer box has reverse gear it's wrong

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.660 
transfer box has reverse gear it's wrong
so<00:03:06.459> that's<00:03:06.640> in<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.540> forward<00:03:07.870> position<00:03:08.670> so

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
so that's in the forward position so

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.050

forward okay it is a job here yeah so

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.860 
forward okay it is a job here yeah so
just<00:03:30.190> literally<00:03:30.910> just<00:03:31.209> goes<00:03:31.359> together<00:03:31.630> like

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
just literally just goes together like

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.979 
just literally just goes together like
that<00:03:32.019> as<00:03:32.380> a<00:03:32.410> clutch<00:03:32.910> yes<00:03:33.910> a<00:03:33.940> gear<00:03:34.329> for<00:03:34.660> reverse

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
that as a clutch yes a gear for reverse

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.449 
that as a clutch yes a gear for reverse
so<00:03:35.709> it<00:03:36.190> if<00:03:37.150> I'm<00:03:37.359> stationary<00:03:37.989> here<00:03:38.230> it<00:03:39.220> might

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
so it if I'm stationary here it might

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:44.039 
so it if I'm stationary here it might
not<00:03:39.489> go<00:03:39.849> in<00:03:40.980> you<00:03:41.980> get<00:03:42.160> over<00:03:42.280> me<00:03:42.400> yeah<00:03:43.000> so<00:03:43.750> it's

not go in you get over me yeah so it's
always<00:03:44.380> best<00:03:44.560> at<00:03:44.769> the<00:03:44.889> engines<00:03:45.250> running<00:03:45.519> just

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
always best at the engines running just

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.150 
always best at the engines running just
save<00:03:46.540> us<00:03:46.780> a<00:03:46.810> bit<00:03:46.989> of<00:03:47.019> load<00:03:47.319> on<00:03:47.590> the<00:03:47.620> input<00:03:47.889> shaft

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
save us a bit of load on the input shaft

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.729 
save us a bit of load on the input shaft
the<00:03:48.819> Prince<00:03:49.060> those<00:03:49.329> rocks<00:03:49.569> so<00:03:50.290> as<00:03:50.349> soon<00:03:50.470> as<00:03:50.620> you

the Prince those rocks so as soon as you
pop<00:03:50.980> it<00:03:51.130> back<00:03:51.160> the<00:03:52.000> gears<00:03:52.269> will<00:03:52.510> just<00:03:52.720> move

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
pop it back the gears will just move

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.630 
pop it back the gears will just move
just<00:03:53.230> very<00:03:53.470> slightly<00:03:53.739> and<00:03:54.160> then<00:03:54.310> just<00:03:54.639> engage

just very slightly and then just engage

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.490 
just very slightly and then just engage
it's<00:03:56.640> better<00:03:56.819> than<00:03:57.000> engine<00:03:57.239> runs<00:03:57.480> yeah<00:03:58.140> and<00:03:58.380> I

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
it's better than engine runs yeah and I

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.640 
it's better than engine runs yeah and I
must<00:03:58.739> cover<00:03:59.160> yeah<00:04:00.030> yeah<00:04:00.390> antenna<00:04:01.050> and<00:04:01.380> with

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
must cover yeah yeah antenna and with
