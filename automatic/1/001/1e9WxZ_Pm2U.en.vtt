00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
able to work all together is actually a

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.199 
able to work all together is actually a
fantastic<00:02:06.140> opportunity<00:02:06.640> because<00:02:07.640> everyone's

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
fantastic opportunity because everyone's

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.359 
fantastic opportunity because everyone's
got<00:02:08.450> the<00:02:08.690> riding<00:02:09.110> and<00:02:09.379> the<00:02:09.500> athlete's<00:02:09.920> vision

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
got the riding and the athlete's vision

above<00:02:11.000> this<00:02:11.269> simple<00:02:11.660> engineering<00:02:11.989> so<00:02:12.799> I<00:02:12.829> think

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
above this simple engineering so I think

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.190 
above this simple engineering so I think
it's<00:02:13.370> a<00:02:13.459> great<00:02:13.700> way<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.030> actually<00:02:14.629> associate

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
it's a great way to actually associate

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:30.160 
it's a great way to actually associate
the<00:02:15.379> theory<00:02:15.859> to<00:02:16.459> the<00:02:16.609> practical<00:02:17.150> challenge

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170
