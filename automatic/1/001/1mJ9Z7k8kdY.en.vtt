 Russian Federation devices for

 enshrined in the constitution first is

 state integrity and unity 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.439
 state authority territory 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.560
 Russian Federation is 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.560
 at the same time territory and its subject 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.090
 constitution of the russian federation 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.439
 establishes that the sovereignty of Russia 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.670
 is located throughout its territory 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.430
 this principle of integrity and 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.380
 immunity 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.420
 the territory is fixed 4 articles 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.040
 constitution cannot be put under 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.479
 doubt the connection with the federated 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.479
 device of our country 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.210
 federal laws also 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.939
 spread over the whole territory 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:04.439
 Russian Federation there is a clear 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.590
 separation of powers between 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.959
 federal agencies and authorities 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.030
 subjects of the federation to the Russian 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.080
 the federations are related only to what 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.390
 is necessary 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.790
 systems are sufficient to establish 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.860
 protect sovereignty supremacy 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.320
 of the Russian Federation 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.270
 its entire territory and to protect the rights and 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.670
 freedom of every person in whatever part 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:33.720
 countries he did not live wherever he was 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:39.360
 there was equality of subjects 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:41.490
 Federation is also a very important principle. 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.670
 is that all subjects 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.260
 Russian Federation have the same 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.480
 representation standards of federal 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.860
 bodies have the right of legislative 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.580
 initiatives 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.270
 each of them can on a contractual basis 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.610
 delegate some of their powers 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.700
 Russian Federation or other 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.980
 constitutional laws have 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.700
 equal force on all subjects 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.700
 federations 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.620
 nevertheless there is a right to 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.690
 self determination but with one condition 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.270
 something self defining inside 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.700
 Russian Federation, it manifests itself 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:21.150
 freedom to resolve political issues 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:25.830
 inside the subject principle there is for example 2 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.700
 Subject times will decide on their 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.310
 in unity 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.489
 or vice versa suppose from one subject 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.200
 two are formed then the federal government is not 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.150
 will be there and hinder if 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.280
 will will express the people the main thing 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.480
 so that they do not want to leave the composition 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.480
 Russian Federation
