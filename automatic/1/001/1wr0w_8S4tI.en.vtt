okay<00:00:27.259> so<00:00:27.320> that's<00:00:27.770> what<00:00:28.160> happens<00:00:28.670> when<00:00:28.849> you<00:00:28.939> buy

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150

the<00:00:29.509> scene<00:00:29.810> immediately<00:00:30.050> plays<00:00:30.980> like<00:00:31.730> I<00:00:31.880> was

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
the scene immediately plays like I was

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:33.850 
the scene immediately plays like I was
saying<00:00:32.300> maybe<00:00:32.540> that's<00:00:32.930> why<00:00:33.170> the<00:00:33.230> game<00:00:33.650> was

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
saying maybe that's why the game was

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.500 
saying maybe that's why the game was
taking<00:00:34.220> so<00:00:34.370> long<00:00:34.400> to<00:00:34.879> load<00:00:35.059> it<00:00:35.270> is

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
taking so long to load it is

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.540 
taking so long to load it is
unbelievable<00:00:36.140> and<00:00:36.410> you<00:00:37.070> know<00:00:37.190> they<00:00:37.370> actually

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
unbelievable and you know they actually

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.000 
unbelievable and you know they actually
said<00:00:38.090> that<00:00:38.120> I<00:00:38.570> ran<00:00:39.019> out<00:00:39.199> of<00:00:39.230> space

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
said that I ran out of space

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.130 
said that I ran out of space
and<00:00:40.160> then<00:00:40.340> I<00:00:40.489> I<00:00:40.790> want<00:00:41.239> to<00:00:41.330> take<00:00:41.510> a<00:00:41.540> look<00:00:41.780> at<00:00:41.989> it

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
and then I I want to take a look at it

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.439 
and then I I want to take a look at it
and<00:00:42.260> surprisingly<00:00:43.160> then<00:00:43.640> I<00:00:43.670> still<00:00:44.120> had<00:00:44.269> like

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449 
and surprisingly then I still had like

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:47.920 
and surprisingly then I still had like
five<00:00:44.750> point<00:00:45.050> nine<00:00:45.170> gigs<00:00:45.710> left<00:00:46.190> of<00:00:46.460> space<00:00:47.180> so

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
five point nine gigs left of space so

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.020 
five point nine gigs left of space so
I'm<00:00:48.410> guessing<00:00:49.100> it's<00:00:49.250> because<00:00:49.309> it's<00:00:49.730> an<00:00:49.850> old

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
I'm guessing it's because it's an old

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.090 
I'm guessing it's because it's an old
iPad<00:00:50.629> that's<00:00:50.870> why<00:00:51.049> it<00:00:51.110> isn't<00:00:51.440> working<00:00:51.650> that

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
iPad that's why it isn't working that

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.520 
iPad that's why it isn't working that
well<00:00:52.250> but<00:00:52.729> here<00:00:52.970> we<00:00:53.089> are<00:00:53.120> with<00:00:53.449> the<00:00:53.600> green<00:00:53.989> def
