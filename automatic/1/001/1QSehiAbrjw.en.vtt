00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.019
 remember that from the episode that 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.910
 comes we start with what is the top 10 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.179
 of halo 4 so let's start from 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.179
 once 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.510
 at number 5 it reaches mrc graphs 343 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.790
 where he pulls his hammer here in this 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.380
 is rival then good here makes a 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.880
 small streak here and it reaches the double 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.830
 death I want to look for more is looking 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.090
 all the enemies here makes a triple 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.730
 death is to the other base 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.110
 annihilation then you are looking for is 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.420
 looking for enemies to continue with his 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.460
 streak reaches a 15 aguilar here makes 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.930
 an atrocity then good still 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.059
 Searching continues searching here it reaches you already 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.309
 they want to kill it kill rats and the action 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.840
 end a catastrophe and good was found 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.629
 these guys in the end and just managed 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.519
 kill them but hey only managed to kill 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.989
 two at the end to do their frenzy but 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:57.110
 They did not find him for the streak but 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:00.250
 well there we see how he manages to do 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.250
 that little streak 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.840
 and in the 4 comes to violate cardones here 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.060
 he wanted sniper in this that he is guiding 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.950
 very much then good at the end age 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.630
 shoot sale in old age I do not look for 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.850
 perfect for the guy who saw there 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.770
 also and nothing else sees two at the end here 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.540
 assured one death and the other for his 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.370
 double death perfect here we see common 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.380
 how is it that he is hit here he stopped 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.840
 little image then at the end what 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.360
 kill the other one is found and then at 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.160
 end of his double death apart and good 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.170
 and we see how with a bit of luck but it 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.170
 he managed to raffle a little smell to give here 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.650
 and in number 3 we have a fail of 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.750
 heavy walk where good here we see that what 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.150
 they kill and they give him his supplies then 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.580
 He will ask his gun and leave it 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.590
 on the map within the map he asks for them but 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.670
 look where they left them there we see 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.500
 how he felt like that with an ok face because 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.300
 well then we see how it could not 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.640
 pick up his shotgun and the final world 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.500
 comes this guy from the back tried to do 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.000
 An animate waits for a game but the bully 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.000
 well here we see how it is that I catch the 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.280
 supplies and there he stays waiting very 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.750
 sad supplies because he could not 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.640
 have the shotgun that I wanted so much and 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.680
 well here we see a little what was the 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.680
 fei fei lady walk 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.460
 and for number 2 we have flavor of 78 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.500
 90 where we see that he pulls his bear here 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.150
 wants to kill an enemy and well you 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.490
 escape a little with the rocket backpack and 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.440
 we see how they follow it and not kill active 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.180
 his function promises and gives shot to the 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.980
 head then keep looking for people 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.050
 here makes it a perfect line for the 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.000
 time that was coming back and well this was 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.340
 practically the wing but after 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.870
 this was an attack of the cac and we see 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.630
 how do you want to kill this guy that 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.340
 he has the ax rockets and wishing he had 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.560
 transporting here already at the end it was 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.480
 when he killed him he asks good he stole his 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.120
 rockets and good are more frequent and at 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:03.910
 final about two deaths with that but 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.910
 well here is a wing fail to run 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.269
 and finally we have the demolition lf 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.540
 where we see that it is perhaps sniper here 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:17.670
 double aerial snapshot as well as what 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.250
 they saw here we see how it comes out 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:24.530
 jumping of this guy doing headshot 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:27.020
 perfect for these two types well pro 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.330
