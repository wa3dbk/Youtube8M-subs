00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:06.500
(the water in the bathtub will be ready soon)

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.260
Thanks for watching and sorry for being late today!

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.120
I was asked in the comments if I like Japanese food...

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.740
and that reminded me that every time I meet a Japanese person for the first time...

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.760
and tell them that I like Japanese food

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.600
I always get asked about two specific things

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.380
Japanese people always want to know if I also like these two specific things

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:48.900
These two are actually things many foreigners don't like

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.000
No. 1:

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.760
No. 1: Natto!

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.900
Many people don't li...

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.380
("The bathtub is ready!")

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.500
Many people don't like Natto

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.540
Because it's really sticky and also looks... special

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.780
I eat Natto sometimes

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:19.480
I like it, but I would not want to have it every day

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.140
But it's good in the morning

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:31.000
Or as an ingredient for pasta or omelettes 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.840
That's how I like it

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.620
Many foreigners get scared off by how it looks

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.780
It's not convincing if you show this to someone and say "Oh it tastes sooo good"

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.660
(lame Japanese joke)

00:01:50.773 --> 00:01:52.773
Special, but good

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.320
The second thing is Umeboshi

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.280
My wife made these ones here

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.440
Umeboshi also don't really look tasty at first glance

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:15.260
They are very sour so many people don't like them I guess

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.520
Including me...

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.900
These are Umeboshi with perilla

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.520
These are flavored with honey

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:33.220
They are not that sour so I can eat them too

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:43.220
I want someone to develop videos you can smell to show you how good they smell

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.020
And these are normal Umeboshi

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:54.260
I always get asked about Umeboshi and Natto

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:01.480
And yeah, I like Natto but I don't really like Umeboshi

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.600
I'm sure you also have some things you don't like

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.500
but what is your least favorite food?

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.240
For me it's Green shiso leaves

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.400
Like the ones used in the first Umeboshi I showed you, bad combination for me

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.520
I can't stand the taste of Green shiso leaves

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:32.280
Some people say the taste similar to Coriander but that's bull**it in my opinion

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.880
Other than shiso leaves, I can eat all Japanese food

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.880
Well, this Natto will be my dinner for today

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:50.760
I had loads of Indian food for lunch so I'm still full

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.020
I have no rice prepared so it's just Natto

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.200
Really thanks a lot for watching 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:09.760
Tomorrow's video will also be late I guess but please come by again
