Jamie<00:02:31.459> says<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.880> wind<00:02:32.060> keeps<00:02:32.270> changing

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
Jamie says the wind keeps changing

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.210 
Jamie says the wind keeps changing
direction<00:02:32.959> makes<00:02:33.410> it<00:02:33.530> a<00:02:33.560> little<00:02:33.650> bit<00:02:33.890> harder

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
direction makes it a little bit harder

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.900 
direction makes it a little bit harder
especially<00:02:34.820> cuz<00:02:35.330> he's<00:02:35.450> only<00:02:35.810> flown<00:02:36.350> it<00:02:36.560> today

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
especially cuz he's only flown it today

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.830 
especially cuz he's only flown it today
so<00:02:37.910> he's<00:02:38.090> still<00:02:38.300> kind<00:02:38.540> of<00:02:38.690> just<00:02:38.840> learning<00:02:40.840> yeah

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
so he's still kind of just learning yeah

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.890 
so he's still kind of just learning yeah
now<00:02:42.290> there's<00:02:42.530> no<00:02:42.739> wind<00:02:43.150> now<00:02:44.150> I<00:02:44.180> feel<00:02:44.510> a<00:02:44.540> little

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
now there's no wind now I feel a little

00:02:44.900 --> 00:03:12.839 
now there's no wind now I feel a little
breeze

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.500 

like<00:03:13.749> trying<00:03:14.019> to<00:03:14.079> follow<00:03:14.290> vert<00:03:14.590> in<00:03:14.799> the<00:03:14.890> sky

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
like trying to follow vert in the sky

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:52.449 
like trying to follow vert in the sky
kind<00:03:16.510> of<00:03:16.599> difficult<00:03:32.819> yay

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:04:34.029 

he's<00:03:53.459> maybe<00:03:53.670> to<00:03:53.849> go<00:03:53.970> faster<00:03:54.360> I<00:03:54.390> can<00:03:54.569> fold

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:34.039 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:36.370 

that's<00:04:35.039> okay

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
that's okay

00:04:36.380 --> 00:05:03.740 
that's okay
nice<00:04:37.380> video<00:04:37.740> and<00:04:37.979> now<00:04:38.130> I<00:05:02.180> should<00:05:03.180> a<00:05:03.210> video<00:05:03.479> this

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
nice video and now I should a video this

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.110 
nice video and now I should a video this
but<00:05:03.930> I<00:05:03.960> didn't<00:05:04.320> um<00:05:04.860> but<00:05:05.550> it's<00:05:05.669> actually<00:05:05.970> really

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
but I didn't um but it's actually really

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.850 
but I didn't um but it's actually really
easy<00:05:06.240> to<00:05:06.570> take<00:05:06.690> apart<00:05:06.840> and<00:05:07.229> then<00:05:07.380> it<00:05:07.470> folds<00:05:07.770> up

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
easy to take apart and then it folds up

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.700 
easy to take apart and then it folds up
and<00:05:07.979> it<00:05:08.099> fits<00:05:08.310> right<00:05:08.430> in<00:05:08.550> its<00:05:08.669> own<00:05:08.789> case

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
and it fits right in its own case

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.550 
and it fits right in its own case
interesting<00:05:10.710> that's<00:05:11.580> what<00:05:11.789> keeps<00:05:12.060> it<00:05:12.560> the

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
interesting that's what keeps it the

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.490 
interesting that's what keeps it the
argument<00:05:13.800> goes<00:05:14.340> to<00:05:15.000> the<00:05:15.180> center<00:05:15.599> and<00:05:16.200> then<00:05:16.349> to

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
argument goes to the center and then to

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.760 
argument goes to the center and then to
the<00:05:16.590> wing<00:05:16.880> and<00:05:17.880> that<00:05:18.060> keeps<00:05:18.360> the<00:05:18.599> arc<00:05:19.200> accurate

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
the wing and that keeps the arc accurate

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.940 
the wing and that keeps the arc accurate
