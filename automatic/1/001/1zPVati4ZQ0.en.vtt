 fine if the production that good good 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:15.150
 this movie is in it 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.950
 I'm going to put it because it has not yet 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:22.020
 left neither Spanish nor Latin then 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:25.110
 it's subtitled 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.150
 and although it may be bullshit 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.560
 to be reading everything he says is worth the 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.780

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.820

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.110

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:36.210

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.680
 abb in this assortment film they pass it 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.730
 more or less they pass it sometimes fast to 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.660
 sometimes it happens a little slow so they have 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.860
 to get used to 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.590
 and good 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.500
 the truth is that if it's worth seeing it and 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.050
 I recommend them a lot so I hope 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:35.050

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:37.650
