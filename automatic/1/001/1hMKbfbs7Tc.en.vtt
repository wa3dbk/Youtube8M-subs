00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.990
 mind they are animal lovers 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.520
 a member of the aviv and england foundation infiltrated the circus 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:12.780
 irago these scenes I remind you these images are of 5 brothers gasca the 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.939
 same where they are thinking to take their children tomorrow Sunday 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.940
 animal abuse hears 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.200
 huajuapan 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.790
 as 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.790
 as 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.230
 so this is the way the gasca brothers circus protects the 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.600
 animals it is necessary to have meetings to understand that they are not only big 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.499
 violators of animal rights 

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:02.749
 if not what deliberate and deceitful way they place posters in the light 

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:05.749
 public where they say they support the abused child 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.550
 if it was known that in the circus is mistreating animals would come 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:28.360
 Indian 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.360
 I do not think so 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.570
 they are not the same goals that later they did not allow me to be recorded 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.570
 it will be that the blows are noticed 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.860
 sergio pino advise the animal abuse that many centers are sometimes given 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.010
 I think that's 1 is important 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.180
 It is important 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.670
 the circuses 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.349
 they do not even take into account the natural habitat 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:12.470
 not even the weather that these animals would normally have been born divided 

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:16.649
 the place had to fly over the African plain under the sunrise sun 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:19.070
 this king of the jungle 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.750
 he huddles in a metal container under an icy snow 

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:25.369
 no polar bear 

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:27.980
 you have to change the wide frozen desert 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.570
 a world in which I would marry and swim and already by a cage in the back of a 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:33.189
 truck 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:35.139
 under a sweltering heat 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:39.109
 with just a small homemade fan to keep cool 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:42.890
 many times 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.300
 animals die due to abuse 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.879
 or the adverse conditions in which they live in these mobile prisons 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.249
 like this giraffe 

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:54.599
 who died in his absurd and inexplicable sentence 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:55.640
 but the circus 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.799
 makes sure that the public does not find out about his death 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.609
 but how to remove such a large animal without the public noticing 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:05.219
 here is the answer 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:08.219
 they quartered 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:12.439
 we know that other animals feel just like humans 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:14.759
 they feel afraid 

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:17.229
 loneliness 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:20.589
 which animal would choose to live in captivity if it had a choice 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:25.760
 our wise and honest decision to never visit this kind of 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.800
 spectacles 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.910
 could be the difference and the noble life of thousands of animals subjected to 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.239
 injustice 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:33.329
 of course 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.489
 one will again take their children to witness this incognito spectacle
