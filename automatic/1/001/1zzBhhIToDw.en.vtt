00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.440
 and salt has become a mobile focus 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.040
 beaten it is also the chance and 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:12.230
 none and to the stand of netapp months 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.230
 would have a camera on it 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.290
 this little camera is netapp novell 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.760
 come and what she does is in principle 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.710
 but do it a bit 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.570
 more transparent and easier 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.460
 how exactly that works I tell 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.290
 you have us now you have in principle 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.870
 a camera recognizes the faces 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.850
 Although the blue are unknown, for example 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.680
 You can just yellow it 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.120
 what not if someone after 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.620
 Home is just being recognized 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.750
 matthias came home like me 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.100
 The banks have no if so 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.050
 unknown will be recognized 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.060
 recorded message and known 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.230
 human at home or if you want that 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.600
 At night we fly the children home 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.770
 are all that if you know 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.150
 then want the games is at home 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.290
 possible to open the door so you 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.910
 can really set very much 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.310
 this is a very interesting product 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.390
 for one hand, surveillance is one 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.860
 bit difficult topic but 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.930
 on the other hand quite even very transparent 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.369
 designed there is network connection 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.080
 so that the eyes look small film 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.460
 can from the app in principle 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.680
 the recordings are only on the micro 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.810
 SD card saved so just not 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.520
 does not get outside like his videos 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.930
 uploaded but for security is from 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.400
 every video as open and short 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.020
 a screenshot uploaded the cloud 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.999
 so even if the camera stole him 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.200
 will and the map you know it became 

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:23.479
 a video taken but unknown 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.549
 there or something is so relatively safe 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.929
 after that, too, with it built-in 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:28.909
 But the face recognition is not valid 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:30.590
 nobody can do that 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.689
 predicting something is not exactly accurate 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.100
 is good enough but no matter microphone is 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:36.229
 that also means we really do 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.210
 is recorded what the people say and 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.130
 Above all, I'm on the services 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.100
 accesses a red led lit so 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.780
 said again more it really is 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.069
 recordings of surveillance have yet 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.389
 very interesting design that 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:49.609
 notices when it is recorded 

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:52.700
 If you want to do that, go there 

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:54.740
 199 euros should be the whole cost 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.979
 again network camera not so much 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.509
 on the other hand is a bit niche ob 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.920
 you need to know each one myself 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.920
 find it interesting and that's it
