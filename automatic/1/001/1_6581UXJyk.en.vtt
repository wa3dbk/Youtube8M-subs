00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.809
 and very good people as you are 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.930
 welcome to an egg tutorial on 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.690
 how to make a 100% cactus farm 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.790
 efficient audio people yesterday part gaks 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.980
 he got his own design worth the first 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.890
 farm design let your times have 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.050
 next voucher does not lose any item and 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.420
 well I decided to make my own design and 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.080
 I came out quite good enough 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.730
 cool since it occupies very very little and they occupy 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.890
 very few resources also first I 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.750
 came out in this ballet and then this one that in 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.239
 my opinion is pretty much better 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.250
 well let's quickly apply how 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.800
 the law works you have to have the 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:48.059
 link of the video and the cannes channel 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.969
 to participate in it in the description 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.820
 it who you know that when there was a 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.610
 cactus you gave the last side an item 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.879
 it breaks already as if it were a side worth 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.640
 to see if and disappear does not have 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.120
 we say that the item disappears and 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.120
 destroys 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.400
 to see how this works well when 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:16.030
 grow the cactus here in this vast and what 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.670
 will detect vale is such that well then 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.060
 the cactus when detecting that it has a 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:25.960
 block is worth as you know the cactus is worth 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:29.170
 if it's here a block next to it is worth and 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.750
 grows it will break vale we are going to put a 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.700
 example and it breaks you see that it breaks 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.880
 well when it grows it will break the 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:42.610
 alone and just will detect it and push 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:44.830
 this block here and it will make it fall in the the 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.899
 hopper hunter before breaking in the 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.700
 tangent cactus I will demonstrate how 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:52.230
 it works quickly let's put the 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:56.850
 game room command 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:02:00.450
 rule correct random random ticket speed 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.250
 and we're going to put it to 1000 so that in 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.350
 the tics of minecraft go faster and 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.300
 you can see how it grows worth this 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.780
 obviously I would have to go like this 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.450
 covered and as you can see all the 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.280
 Sometimes that will grow is going to get here 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.090
 it's worth without exception we're going to tell 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.620
 worth 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.670
 one 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.080
 2 did not want to break any voucher and we 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.280
 we go 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:29.340
 3 well as you see never never breaks 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.980
 no item that comes out of here is worth it 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.110
 let's put it again it's normal 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.540
 good know we 're going to do the first 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.160
 design I like more the second one since it's 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.590
 more compact and had fewer resources but 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.110
 let's go in order, ok, we have 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.660
 made our step that will be with a 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.630
 sticky floor a block of slate and a 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.840
 reston block and it would work the 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.880
 equivalent glass you see but as our 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.970
 circuit is going to give half a pulse we're going to 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:00.000
 put a normal piston is worth and here 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.610
 up another normal seen pulling towards 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.800
 down perfect right here we are going to put 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.870
 An aid nothing is worth can also 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.780
 serve another block is not playable type 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.990
 oven is worth so that this does not break the 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:17.319
 circuit what is worth here sees us and now 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:20.920
 a tic we climb like a torch 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:24.450
 block block and repeater to a main 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:27.010
 in good this would work 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.739
 and from here it would be very simple 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.620
 we carry current from here and 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:36.849
 we go down with a sticky piston block of 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.170
 reston and seen normal with bad block 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:40.269
 good good people this is the one that I 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.060
 I recommend doing vale since it is the one that 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:45.370
 I like the most and the most to do in 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.170
 survival and good let's do the same 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.230
 as above it 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.959
 and here and here we make our 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.610
 bad sweet, but here we are going to change 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.400
 and we are going to put block not imputable 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.840
 here it's worth next to the rest block 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.430
 let's go for the alderman 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:07.110
 and we went up with a block pancake and 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:09.510
 antorchistas this would already be worth 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.720
 see is a tad slower than the 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:16.100
 previous but it works exactly the same 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.889
 and just as well here we are going to take us 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:22.280
 one of rest 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:26.150
 a piston of a normal piston and here a 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.400
 Sticky piston with a block is worth this 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.069
 how it works is of the rest for 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.159
 transmit the kingston signal and the 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:37.310
 piston as it carries the maximum current 

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:40.340
 value of 15 will transmit the signal of 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:43.909
 here until here is worth as you see the 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.499
 pistons if given current 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:48.229
 top down with the maximum 

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:50.150
 power let's see it 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:52.669
 for example it's worth the top 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.560
 well to work the same in the part of 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:56.779
 down not on top always 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.349
 is to activate something because it is worth for this that 

00:04:56.779 --> 00:05:00.830
 is based 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:03.710
 the same is worth it simply would make 5 vale 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:08.240
 ok let's check how it works 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:10.380
 ok let's put this to me there is and 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.409
 go Go 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:16.219
 and we have one 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:18.289
 2 and there goes good people an agent for 

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:20.809
 last say that this design the second 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:22.610
 it's totally expandable what 

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:25.369
 it means that you do not have to 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.559
 leave no gap here is worth it since it 

00:05:25.369 --> 00:05:30.559
 You can put one next to another but 

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:32.419
 this time in reverse, as you see, no 

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:35.449
 there is no gap worth here we have a 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:37.090
 module and just where back we have another 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:39.790
 here it's worth 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.800
 I'm going to show you how to link the vouchers 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:43.900
 good to say that I recommend 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.120
 totally put blocks here is worth for 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.550
 let us out just in case but good 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.410
 I teach so quickly because it 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.139
 we already have a module here is worth 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:55.840
 let's put one looking towards there go 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:58.360
 well how would this be good we go to 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.610
 take this block as a reference value 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.800
 obsidian and today we are going to 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:05.620
 put the repeated to call we're going to 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:09.180
 make mirror effect we are going to climb 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:11.729
 here around here 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:17.100
 over here we continue to put our 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:20.940
 patrick will go to this height if what is 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:22.320
 line block the rest and here we go to 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.240
 put 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:28.720
 here our vector 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:32.160
 normal piston piston for that and here 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:36.310
 would go our normative block here and 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:39.069
 our asset is quickly seen and and 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:41.620
 here it's worth people because that's how it would link and 

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:43.330
 so we can lengthen everything the leader 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.870
 and ok and well I hope you liked it 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:49.440
 who is tutor already and you know lx favorites 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.440
 bye
