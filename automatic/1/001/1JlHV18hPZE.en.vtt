00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.610
 g 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.390
 good morning everyone is alessio 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.460
 marazzini course of the top leaders and are in 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.680
 company of andrea backpack of the sd 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.730
 brescia champions for and for the absolute 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:36.500
 category 66 kg and around the 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:40.010
 Italian record posting approach from 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:44.780
 first off, the position of the 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:49.220
 consequently full bones supported 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:52.300
 against the barbell I will now illustrate one 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:55.129
 average posture valid for all 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.870
 obviously the toes are 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.900
 direct to the outside because 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.309
 knees during movement 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.390
 will go in the direction of the tips of the 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.710
 feet a bit like sports 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.620
 Once the feet are in place, the magic begins 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.690
 I have to lift my arms 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:15.440
 lie down 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.860
 keeping the chest and highest possible 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:22.130
 in the starting position the shins 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:25.399
 remain vertical to the floor and the 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.140
 basin must not go backwards but must 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:29.600
 get as close as possible to the 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.969
 barbell to allow the back 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.460
 to be as vertical as possible 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:38.719
 the loading phase is carried out on the ground 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.240
 starts what is the real thrust e 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:43.250
 own to make riser you take 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.659
 pulling with parts you start with one 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.490
 thrust that realizes movement 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.159
 a movement is given by the synergy of 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.499
 two thrusts of legs and that 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.100
 of the back that they must achieve a 

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:58.240
 harmonious movement 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.289
 let's see what the mistakes are anymore 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:05.409
 only the first is typical of the state 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:11.170
 the one in the setup phase have 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:15.120
 the shoulders closed ahead this not 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.120
 allows you to complete the sata 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.879
 the second laurel is more common than yes 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.590
 can commit to consumption is that 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:30.170
 to jerk rocker arm ie 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:34.700
 an abrupt departure that now andrea ci 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.920
 they show this leads to realizing 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.069
 a movement decomposed in his 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.069
 execution 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.370
 the correct movement provides for 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.200
 perform a good loading phase 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.540
 an initial push in which rocker yes 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.940
 pensiona after which it is essential 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.829
 acceleration the athlete must impress 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.829
 maximum acceleration to the balance wheel 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:05.379
 andrea will now show us the third goal it is 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:05.379
 more common than sumo detachment ie 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:12.680
 acceleration loading phase 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.170
 excessive closure this is not good 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:20.000
 not good and not good for the back 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:22.040
 of the cutter we now place attention on the 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.609
 type of socket and can be carried out from 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:28.160
 detachment there are three types of sockets the 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:30.950
 before I show you and the double 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:35.810
 prone and maintains the maximum 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:38.510
 body symmetry exists you want the grip 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.310
 mixed which is used at the time 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.190
 in which that test is not able to 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.530
 ensure the grip on the balance this 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.440
 taking is already more effective and is the one more 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.440
 commonly used then exists one 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.740
 third alternative that was taken 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:57.930
 the slip is a double grip find 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:04:01.720
 where the thumb is tightened underneath 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:05.070
 to the remedy index is an outlet that 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.070
 they use very few athletes
