 interactive panels for subscription to 

00:00:05.289 --> 00:00:09.100
 multiplayer in this case we have the 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:11.440
 version of add - ons because those that 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.110
 some are usually necessary that are 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.480
 5.2.1 fans of the new version that came out 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.380
 for 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.119
 the servers 0 37 and well what 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.310
 they mean the bells to explain them 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.550
 first amp is from san andreas 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.739
 multiplayer of fun and cs is from the 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.270
 completion of a file that I read as 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:32.430
 the people who follow me know that a 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.650
 cc file is in the been I believe by 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.559
 bait example s points like knit it 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.020
 is fly point is being etcetera 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.520
 bunch of kids 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.040
 and well let's go here we leave 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.920
 to download here on our website 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.630
 my page and explain what it consists of 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.500
 better this thing is rather not common 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:54.239
 than a file that I need to 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.900
 kleos certain you have given to 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.490
 cÃ©line currently 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.490
 as a superior power 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.700
 by the codes of a file 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.939
 anyway 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.009
 asks them is much better is the word is 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:14.150
 much better you go out with the hacks 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.530
 they are better 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.400
 in fact the cracks that is taking out 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.980
 currently they are much better 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.860
 you need in this file like 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:26.380
 minimum requirement that is the sant fans 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.360
 we give in download I do not download it 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.490
 because I have it, you canceled it 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:35.120
 download this file will remain in the 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:37.880
 desk ok we double click 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.830
 for us to open now we're going 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.270
 equipment where we have installed our 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.250
 costs andreas I in my case I have 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.900
 installed on the local disk of the 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.420
 folder that you are andreas we open it and 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.920
 we are not going to enter we take off this 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.590
 file that is called stand points to 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.250
 point so we paste it we drag it in 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.240
 no folder we put a dam 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.240
 because they invest it installed 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.590
 and we'll have the file there with this already 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.590
 we have installed sant funk 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.950
 to make multiplayer flag version 0 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.810
 37 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.400
 to demonstrate a gameplay of the 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.010
 presentation server as 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.989
 it shows as its interface 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.840
 after this it will begin to raise cores 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:23.030
 for sanz fans because in this way not 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.040
 they will notice the difference only 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.140
 you will notice the change of game interface 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.599
 I hope you like it we do not see the mind 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.050
 this the new interface of the game like this 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:34.130
 present the game when you 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.130
 those in front 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.310
 albany ideas net 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.400
 black dot net which is what 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.110
 course the program of these families 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.409
 as you will see tonight when you put a pause 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:09.240
 the project like the codes but it's 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:12.290
 normal adjustments 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.290
 how it works 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.180
 the depression 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.540
 also this is the very good approach 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.540
 we're 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:59.220
 good 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.780
 because this defect 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.380
 some kind of shot in the head that 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.440
 I have you 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:08.480
 cast 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.480
 see you in another video
