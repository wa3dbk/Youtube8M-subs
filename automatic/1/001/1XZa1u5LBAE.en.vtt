found<00:00:13.080> that<00:00:13.259> work<00:00:13.410> so<00:00:13.620> far<00:00:13.830> Zerg<00:00:14.190> is<00:00:14.370> my<00:00:14.519> main

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
found that work so far Zerg is my main

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.880 
found that work so far Zerg is my main
race<00:00:14.940> but<00:00:15.330> for<00:00:15.809> this<00:00:15.960> build<00:00:16.350> we're<00:00:16.710> going<00:00:16.830> to

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
race but for this build we're going to

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.220 
race but for this build we're going to
be<00:00:16.949> using<00:00:17.010> Protoss<00:00:19.340> so<00:00:20.340> we're<00:00:20.490> go<00:00:20.580> insane

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
be using Protoss so we're go insane

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.170 
be using Protoss so we're go insane
Terran<00:00:22.230> because<00:00:22.710> i<00:00:22.859> don't<00:00:23.010> like<00:00:23.039> them<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.640> for

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.500 
the purpose of this video i'm going to
put<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.010> normal<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:27.240> could<00:00:27.359> actually

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
put it to normal you could actually

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.939 
put it to normal you could actually
still<00:00:27.840> get<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.050> achievements<00:00:28.560> for<00:00:28.710> putting

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
still get the achievements for putting

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.470 
still get the achievements for putting
it<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.130> normal<00:00:29.429> speed<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:29.939> if<00:00:30.060> that<00:00:30.179> helps<00:00:30.420> you

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
do this map I'm going on is a griot

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.250 
do this map I'm going on is a griot
Valley<00:00:40.820> just<00:00:41.820> very<00:00:42.090> short<00:00:42.510> rush<00:00:42.719> distance

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
Valley just very short rush distance

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.560 
Valley just very short rush distance
between<00:00:43.649> them<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.100> where<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.059> mineral<00:00:45.390> line

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
between them and where the mineral line

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.180 
between them and where the mineral line
is<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.960> really<00:00:46.050> advantageous<00:00:46.379> for<00:00:46.890> i'm<00:00:47.039> going

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
we're just going to build probes until

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.900 
we're just going to build probes until
we<00:01:06.330> get<00:01:06.979> 9<00:01:07.979> out<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.250> 10<00:01:08.460> should<00:01:09.119> be<00:01:09.270> good<00:01:09.420> enough

sold<00:01:32.550> wingman<00:01:32.880> girls<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:33.990> this<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.460> basically

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
sold wingman girls so this is basically

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:42.889 
sold wingman girls so this is basically
a<00:01:36.570> cannon<00:01:37.560> rush<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:41.270> I've<00:01:42.270> really<00:01:42.660> tried<00:01:42.810> to

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
a cannon rush and I've really tried to

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.080 
a cannon rush and I've really tried to
beat<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.290> AI<00:01:43.380> every<00:01:43.770> other<00:01:43.890> way<00:01:44.100> but<00:01:44.369> they<00:01:44.910> get

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
beat the AI every other way but they get

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.350 
beat the AI every other way but they get
a<00:01:45.229> economic<00:01:46.229> advantage<00:01:46.680> like<00:01:46.979> it's<00:01:47.910> almost<00:01:48.090> as

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
a economic advantage like it's almost as

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.380 
a economic advantage like it's almost as
if<00:01:48.710> their<00:01:49.710> natural<00:01:50.130> other<00:01:50.820> natural<00:01:51.240> their

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
if their natural other natural their

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.139 
if their natural other natural their
main<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.810> literally<00:01:52.170> like<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.320> gold<00:01:53.149> they're

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
main is literally like a gold they're

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.580 
main is literally like a gold they're
all<00:01:54.270> gold<00:01:54.540> minerals<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.080> instead<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.320> taking

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
all gold minerals so instead of taking

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.590 
all gold minerals so instead of taking
back<00:01:55.740> five<00:01:56.009> they're<00:01:56.310> taken<00:01:56.550> back<00:01:56.700> seven<00:01:57.180> each

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
back five they're taken back seven each

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.910 
back five they're taken back seven each
probe<00:01:58.200> or<00:01:58.619> SCB<00:01:59.190> or<00:01:59.369> whatnot<00:02:00.320> which<00:02:01.320> saddens<00:02:01.619> me

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
probe or SCB or whatnot which saddens me

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.969 
probe or SCB or whatnot which saddens me
because<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.610> wish<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.180> could<00:02:03.330> beat<00:02:03.479> them<00:02:03.890> in<00:02:04.890> a

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
because I wish I could beat them in a

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.199 
because I wish I could beat them in a
normal<00:02:05.190> way<00:02:07.009> someplace<00:02:08.009> in<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.369> pile<00:02:08.759> on<00:02:08.940> here

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
normal way someplace in a pile on here

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.990 
normal way someplace in a pile on here
and<00:02:09.479> basically<00:02:10.039> as<00:02:11.039> soon<00:02:11.100> as<00:02:11.400> pile<00:02:11.670> on<00:02:11.850> is

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
and basically as soon as pile on is

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.710 
and basically as soon as pile on is
finished<00:02:12.360> I'm<00:02:12.720> going<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:12.989> build<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.230> forge<00:02:13.500> here

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
finished I'm going to build a forge here

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.060 
finished I'm going to build a forge here
build<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:15.810> cannon<00:02:16.080> or<00:02:16.320> two<00:02:16.470> down<00:02:16.739> here<00:02:16.950> in<00:02:16.980> the

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
build a cannon or two down here in the

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.190 
build a cannon or two down here in the
low<00:02:17.220> ground<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.850> then<00:02:18.120> bring<00:02:18.510> my<00:02:18.630> probe<00:02:18.900> in

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
low ground and then bring my probe in

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.600 
low ground and then bring my probe in
and<00:02:19.470> build<00:02:19.739> a<00:02:19.890> candidate<00:02:20.280> on<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.370> high<00:02:20.580> ground

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
and build a candidate on the high ground

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.250 
and build a candidate on the high ground
and<00:02:21.590> that'll<00:02:22.590> attack<00:02:23.549> his<00:02:23.730> mineral<00:02:24.060> line

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
and that'll attack his mineral line

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.490 
and that'll attack his mineral line
that's<00:02:25.260> done<00:02:26.180> whoops<00:02:27.180> crap<00:02:28.140> i<00:02:28.260> don't<00:02:28.380> remember

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
here i build a pylon here and just start

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.960 
here i build a pylon here and just start
building<00:02:40.049> cannons<00:02:40.440> in<00:02:40.739> his<00:02:41.549> middle<00:02:41.820> line

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
building cannons in his middle line

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.060 
building cannons in his middle line
he'll<00:02:42.269> just<00:02:42.420> kind<00:02:43.019> of<00:02:43.049> freaked<00:02:43.380> out<00:02:43.560> and<00:02:43.830> won't

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
I used to be able to beat the AI by

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.470 
I used to be able to beat the AI by
rushing<00:02:51.900> like<00:02:52.080> a<00:02:52.140> zergling<00:02:52.650> six<00:02:53.130> pool<00:02:53.480> but

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
rushing like a zergling six pool but

rushing like a zergling six pool but
since<00:02:55.170> one<00:02:55.860> of<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.040> new<00:02:56.160> patches<00:02:56.400> I<00:02:56.670> remember

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
since one of the new patches I remember

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.770 
since one of the new patches I remember
when<00:02:57.390> I<00:02:57.829> haven't<00:02:58.829> done<00:02:59.010> it<00:02:59.190> in<00:02:59.220> a<00:02:59.370> while<00:02:59.400> but

when I haven't done it in a while but
one<00:03:00.780> of<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:00.930> patches<00:03:01.320> they<00:03:01.470> did<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.890> AI<00:03:02.070> got<00:03:02.519> a

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
one of the patches they did the AI got a

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.780 
one of the patches they did the AI got a
lot<00:03:03.090> smarter<00:03:03.660> and

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
lot smarter and

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.850 
lot smarter and

it'll actually finish yeah sweet stuff
let's<00:04:01.340> build<00:04:01.790> one<00:04:02.170> right<00:04:03.170> here<00:04:03.379> and<00:04:03.620> it<00:04:03.709> looks

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
let's build one right here and it looks

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:08.580 
let's build one right here and it looks
like<00:04:03.889> it<00:04:04.099> could<00:04:04.250> be<00:04:04.280> a<00:04:04.370> pain<00:04:06.069> sweet

I'll just chill out back here maybe

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:18.030 
I'll just chill out back here maybe
build<00:04:12.040> a<00:04:12.220> pylon<00:04:12.900> that'd<00:04:13.900> be<00:04:14.110> pretty<00:04:14.260> cool<00:04:17.040> SUVs

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
build a pylon that'd be pretty cool SUVs

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.189 
build a pylon that'd be pretty cool SUVs
are<00:04:18.220> like<00:04:18.430> what<00:04:18.639> up<00:04:18.870> we're<00:04:19.870> not<00:04:19.959> doing

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:20.199 
are like what up we're not doing

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:22.980 
are like what up we're not doing
anything<00:04:20.669> his<00:04:21.669> Marines<00:04:22.090> are<00:04:22.389> running<00:04:22.840> around

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
anything his Marines are running around

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.770 
anything his Marines are running around
in<00:04:23.050> circles<00:04:23.910> not<00:04:24.910> knowing<00:04:25.210> what<00:04:25.389> to<00:04:25.419> attack

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
in circles not knowing what to attack

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.590 
in circles not knowing what to attack
first<00:04:26.370> loan<00:04:27.370> reason<00:04:27.699> this<00:04:27.790> really<00:04:28.000> be<00:04:28.120> CAI<00:04:28.449> is

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
first loan reason this really be CAI is

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.390 
first loan reason this really be CAI is
just<00:04:28.990> because<00:04:29.139> you<00:04:29.229> can't<00:04:29.440> commit<00:04:30.190> to<00:04:30.250> a

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
just because you can't commit to a

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.140 
just because you can't commit to a
decision<00:04:30.699> almost<00:04:31.180> like<00:04:31.360> s<00:04:32.639> yeah<00:04:33.639> and<00:04:33.940> once

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
decision almost like s yeah and once

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.000 
decision almost like s yeah and once
this<00:04:34.300> pylon<00:04:34.660> finishes<00:04:35.199> I'll<00:04:35.380> just<00:04:35.530> build<00:04:35.680> some

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
this pylon finishes I'll just build some

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.310 
this pylon finishes I'll just build some
here<00:04:37.000> and<00:04:37.300> then<00:04:37.419> it's<00:04:37.540> pretty<00:04:37.780> much<00:04:37.930> game<00:04:38.290> over

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
here and then it's pretty much game over

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.740 
here and then it's pretty much game over
like<00:04:40.860> this<00:04:41.860> and<00:04:42.190> like<00:04:42.970> I<00:04:43.120> have<00:04:43.240> no<00:04:43.360> skill<00:04:43.630> and

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
like this and like I have no skill and

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.930 
like this and like I have no skill and
protoss<00:04:44.110> and<00:04:44.620> you<00:04:45.130> can<00:04:45.250> see<00:04:45.430> that<00:04:45.460> this<00:04:45.729> is

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
protoss and you can see that this is
