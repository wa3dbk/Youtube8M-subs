the<00:00:25.429> reactive<00:00:25.910> lighting<00:00:26.119> technology<00:00:26.990> uses<00:00:27.679> a

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
the reactive lighting technology uses a

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.009 
the reactive lighting technology uses a
sensor<00:00:28.160> on<00:00:28.519> the<00:00:28.880> front<00:00:29.089> of<00:00:29.179> the<00:00:29.330> torch<00:00:29.570> which

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 
sensor on the front of the torch which

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:31.920 
sensor on the front of the torch which
reacts<00:00:30.380> with<00:00:30.560> the<00:00:30.859> environment<00:00:31.220> and

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
reacts with the environment and

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.690 
reacts with the environment and
automatically<00:00:32.930> adjusts<00:00:33.380> the<00:00:33.410> brightness

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.700 
automatically adjusts the brightness

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.800
