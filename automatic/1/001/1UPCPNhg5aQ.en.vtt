certain amount and then have to reload

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.640 
certain amount and then have to reload
it<00:01:15.330> seems<00:01:15.600> like<00:01:15.750> this<00:01:15.900> gun<00:01:16.140> will<00:01:16.290> have<00:01:16.439> you

know<00:01:16.680> like<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.520> can<00:01:17.700> empty<00:01:17.970> one<00:01:18.240> out<00:01:18.270> while

you're reloading that one empty out the
other<00:01:20.130> one<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.850> seems<00:01:21.060> like<00:01:21.210> if<00:01:21.330> it's<00:01:21.479> dual

basically<00:01:40.409> stops<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.400> zombies<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:41.970> blows

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
basically stops the zombies and blows

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.990 
basically stops the zombies and blows
them<00:01:42.570> up<00:01:42.630> from<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.470> inside<00:01:43.590> out<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.640> bloats

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
them up from the inside out it bloats

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.859 
them up from the inside out it bloats
them<00:01:45.240> up<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.509> they<00:01:45.570> just<00:01:45.720> explode<00:01:46.590> um<00:01:47.869> you

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
them up and they just explode um you

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.679 
them up and they just explode um you
know<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.140> looks<00:01:49.320> crazy<00:01:50.000> it's<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.270> don't<00:01:51.509> know<00:01:51.600> if

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
know it looks crazy it's I don't know if

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.120 
know it looks crazy it's I don't know if
it's<00:01:51.810> going<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:51.990> have<00:01:52.110> sort<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.470> splash<00:01:52.860> damage

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
it's going to have sort of splash damage

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.880 
it's going to have sort of splash damage
since<00:01:53.850> if<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.240> blows<00:01:54.479> up<00:01:54.540> i'll<00:01:54.960> do<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.170> splash

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
since if it blows up i'll do a splash

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.709 
since if it blows up i'll do a splash
damage<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.490> effect<00:01:57.030> those<00:01:57.149> zombies<00:01:57.600> around

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
damage and effect those zombies around

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.639 
damage and effect those zombies around
it<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.290> i<00:01:59.070> do<00:01:59.130> not<00:01:59.399> know<00:02:00.170> the<00:02:01.170> next<00:02:01.350> thing<00:02:01.500> is

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
it that i do not know the next thing is

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.490 
it that i do not know the next thing is
you<00:02:02.399> see<00:02:02.430> dead<00:02:03.360> shot<00:02:03.689> in<00:02:03.930> one<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.350> images

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
you see dead shot in one of the images

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.609 
you see dead shot in one of the images
in<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.219> video<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:05.880> guaranteed<00:02:06.780> debt<00:02:07.320> shots

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
in the video so guaranteed debt shots

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.249 
in the video so guaranteed debt shots
going<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.890> be<00:02:08.009> there<00:02:08.250> or<00:02:08.750> it's<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.899> new<00:02:10.020> perk

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
going to be there or it's the new perk

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.229 
going to be there or it's the new perk
they<00:02:10.410> introduced<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:10.950> call<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.220> dead<00:02:11.430> the

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
they introduced and call the dead the

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.300 
they introduced and call the dead the
one<00:02:12.390> that<00:02:12.510> I<00:02:12.599> never

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
one that I never

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.530 
one that I never
I<00:02:14.310> don't<00:02:15.120> know<00:02:15.180> if<00:02:15.240> they're<00:02:15.360> going<00:02:15.480> to

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
I don't know if they're going to

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.300 
I don't know if they're going to
introduce<00:02:15.780> any<00:02:16.110> perks<00:02:16.440> you<00:02:16.560> didn't<00:02:16.920> see<00:02:17.100> any

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
introduce any perks you didn't see any

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.390 
introduce any perks you didn't see any
new<00:02:17.520> perk<00:02:17.790> machines<00:02:18.180> in<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:19.170> game<00:02:19.620> but<00:02:20.220> it's

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
new perk machines in the game but it's

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.070 
new perk machines in the game but it's
I'm<00:02:20.700> hoping<00:02:21.060> they<00:02:21.180> introduce<00:02:21.540> some<00:02:21.720> sort<00:02:21.959> of

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
I'm hoping they introduce some sort of

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.130 
I'm hoping they introduce some sort of
um<00:02:22.370> perk<00:02:23.370> that<00:02:23.640> will<00:02:24.209> affect<00:02:24.600> them<00:02:24.780> the

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
um perk that will affect them the

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.440 
um perk that will affect them the
gravity<00:02:25.650> because<00:02:26.610> that'd<00:02:26.880> be<00:02:27.060> cool<00:02:27.270> because

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
gravity because that'd be cool because

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.540 
gravity because that'd be cool because
like<00:02:27.780> they<00:02:27.930> said<00:02:28.110> in<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.319> trailer<00:02:28.709> gravity<00:02:29.520> is

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
like they said in the trailer gravity is

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.010 
like they said in the trailer gravity is
going<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:29.820> be<00:02:29.940> such<00:02:30.150> an<00:02:30.300> important<00:02:30.720> thing<00:02:30.900> and

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
going to be such an important thing and

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.180 
going to be such an important thing and
sound<00:02:31.350> of<00:02:31.560> those<00:02:31.650> are<00:02:31.830> going<00:02:31.860> to<00:02:31.980> be<00:02:32.040> an

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
sound of those are going to be an

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.530 
sound of those are going to be an
important<00:02:32.550> thing<00:02:32.670> because<00:02:33.180> since<00:02:33.360> you're<00:02:33.480> on

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
important thing because since you're on

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.540 
important thing because since you're on
the<00:02:33.630> moon<00:02:33.840> gravity<00:02:34.500> is<00:02:34.950> pulling<00:02:35.220> you<00:02:35.459> in

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
the moon gravity is pulling you in

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.040 
the moon gravity is pulling you in
different<00:02:35.700> directions<00:02:35.940> you're<00:02:36.810> a<00:02:36.840> lot

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
different directions you're a lot

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.680 
different directions you're a lot
lighter<00:02:37.320> so<00:02:37.680> you<00:02:37.740> might<00:02:37.980> miss<00:02:38.220> turns<00:02:38.580> and<00:02:38.880> if

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
lighter so you might miss turns and if

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.840 
lighter so you might miss turns and if
there's<00:02:39.930> a<00:02:39.989> perk<00:02:40.320> that<00:02:40.560> can<00:02:40.800> affect<00:02:41.730> your

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
there's a perk that can affect your

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.970 
there's a perk that can affect your
gravity<00:02:42.480> that<00:02:42.810> would<00:02:42.959> be<00:02:43.080> amazing<00:02:43.319> because

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
gravity that would be amazing because

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.760 
gravity that would be amazing because
then<00:02:44.250> you<00:02:44.730> know<00:02:44.850> that<00:02:44.880> would<00:02:45.770> sensitize

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
then you know that would sensitize

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.710 
then you know that would sensitize
people<00:02:47.100> incentivize<00:02:48.000> people<00:02:48.180> musing<00:02:48.600> big

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
people incentivize people musing big

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.900 
people incentivize people musing big
words<00:02:48.900> here<00:02:49.110> people<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.070> go<00:02:50.250> get<00:02:50.430> that<00:02:50.459> perk

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
words here people to go get that perk

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.390 
words here people to go get that perk
and<00:02:51.810> be<00:02:51.989> able<00:02:52.080> to<00:02:52.350> run<00:02:52.620> normally<00:02:53.100> you<00:02:53.250> know

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
and be able to run normally you know

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.640 
and be able to run normally you know
because<00:02:53.730> if<00:02:54.600> not<00:02:54.930> it's<00:02:55.140> going<00:02:55.230> to<00:02:55.320> be<00:02:55.440> a<00:02:55.470> lot

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
because if not it's going to be a lot

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.949 
because if not it's going to be a lot
harder<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:56.190> be<00:02:56.310> jumping<00:02:56.730> in<00:02:56.820> mid-air<00:02:56.970> trying

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
harder to be jumping in mid-air trying

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.449 
harder to be jumping in mid-air trying
to<00:02:58.110> turn<00:02:58.290> around<00:02:58.410> this<00:02:58.650> corner<00:02:58.950> to<00:02:59.040> get<00:02:59.340> in

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
to turn around this corner to get in

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.060 
to turn around this corner to get in
your<00:02:59.640> cycle<00:03:00.150> around<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.570> map<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:01.080> just<00:03:01.980> be

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
your cycle around the map and just be

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.710 
your cycle around the map and just be
completely<00:03:02.220> screwed<00:03:02.730> over<00:03:02.880> because<00:03:03.269> you<00:03:03.360> over

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
completely screwed over because you over

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.570 
completely screwed over because you over
hit<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:04.019> jump<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:04.500> now<00:03:05.010> you're<00:03:05.220> stuck<00:03:05.370> in<00:03:05.430> a

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
hit the jump and now you're stuck in a

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.400 
hit the jump and now you're stuck in a
corner<00:03:05.790> and<00:03:06.150> you<00:03:06.180> have<00:03:06.600> hundreds<00:03:06.959> of<00:03:07.019> zombies

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
corner and you have hundreds of zombies

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.600 
corner and you have hundreds of zombies
piling<00:03:08.370> on<00:03:08.519> top<00:03:08.760> of<00:03:09.000> you<00:03:09.180> so<00:03:10.400> that's<00:03:11.400> something

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
piling on top of you so that's something

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:12.800 
piling on top of you so that's something
to<00:03:11.760> think<00:03:11.850> about<00:03:12.030> I<00:03:12.180> don't<00:03:12.269> know<00:03:12.510> if<00:03:12.660> they're

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
to think about I don't know if they're

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.690 
to think about I don't know if they're
going<00:03:12.930> to<00:03:13.019> do<00:03:13.140> that<00:03:13.290> if<00:03:13.530> there<00:03:14.040> is<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.220> new<00:03:14.459> perk

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
going to do that if there is a new perk

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.430 
going to do that if there is a new perk
if<00:03:14.850> there<00:03:15.030> isn't<00:03:15.450> they're<00:03:16.140> saying<00:03:16.380> that

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
if there isn't they're saying that

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.900 
if there isn't they're saying that
they're<00:03:16.620> mixing<00:03:16.950> in<00:03:17.100> a<00:03:17.160> bunch<00:03:17.370> of<00:03:17.430> elements

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
they're mixing in a bunch of elements

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.729 
they're mixing in a bunch of elements
from<00:03:17.970> all<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.269> zombie<00:03:18.840> maps<00:03:19.019> so<00:03:19.560> there's

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
from all the zombie maps so there's

sunny their space suits in hangar 18 and
I<00:04:32.940> know<00:04:33.210> that's<00:04:33.419> for<00:04:33.690> the<00:04:33.810> Blackbirds<00:04:34.470> because

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
I know that's for the Blackbirds because

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:35.900 
I know that's for the Blackbirds because
they<00:04:34.860> go<00:04:35.009> into<00:04:35.160> high<00:04:35.310> altitudes<00:04:35.789> the

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
they go into high altitudes the

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.620 
they go into high altitudes the
Blackbirds<00:04:37.190> they're<00:04:38.190> meant<00:04:38.400> to<00:04:38.490> be<00:04:38.850> very<00:04:39.419> high

Blackbirds they're meant to be very high
in<00:04:39.690> the<00:04:39.810> sky<00:04:39.990> so<00:04:40.199> people<00:04:40.470> need<00:04:40.590> to<00:04:40.710> wear<00:04:40.830> space

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 
in the sky so people need to wear space

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:43.129 
in the sky so people need to wear space
suits<00:04:41.070> when<00:04:41.430> riding<00:04:41.639> blackbird<00:04:42.180> but<00:04:42.840> you<00:04:42.990> know

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
suits when riding blackbird but you know

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:44.779 
suits when riding blackbird but you know
that's<00:04:43.560> also<00:04:43.889> something<00:04:44.100> that<00:04:44.280> have<00:04:44.550> in<00:04:44.699> the

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
that's also something that have in the

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:47.210 
that's also something that have in the
moon<00:04:44.940> level<00:04:45.330> that<00:04:45.810> is<00:04:45.990> in<00:04:46.110> the<00:04:46.259> map<00:04:46.470> hangar<00:04:46.919> 18

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
moon level that is in the map hangar 18

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.920 
moon level that is in the map hangar 18
so<00:04:47.639> there's<00:04:47.820> just<00:04:47.940> a<00:04:48.030> bunch<00:04:48.150> of<00:04:48.300> similarities

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
so there's just a bunch of similarities

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.230 
so there's just a bunch of similarities
there<00:04:49.580> next<00:04:50.580> thing<00:04:50.729> they<00:04:50.820> said<00:04:51.000> of<00:04:51.090> course

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
there next thing they said of course

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.120 
there next thing they said of course
sound<00:04:51.600> will<00:04:51.840> be<00:04:51.960> affected<00:04:52.470> that<00:04:52.889> you're<00:04:53.070> on

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
the moon sound is portrayed differently

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:56.840 
the moon sound is portrayed differently
through<00:04:55.830> someones<00:04:56.130> ears<00:04:56.340> is<00:04:56.520> going<00:04:56.669> to<00:04:56.729> be

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
through someones ears is going to be

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.550 
through someones ears is going to be
silent<00:04:57.389> I<00:04:57.449> think<00:04:57.479> supposedly<00:04:58.260> you're<00:04:58.410> like

silent I think supposedly you're like

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.670 
silent I think supposedly you're like
much<00:04:59.190> lower<00:04:59.669> the<00:05:00.030> silence<00:05:00.810> and<00:05:00.990> you<00:05:01.080> it'll<00:05:01.560> be

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
much lower the silence and you it'll be

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.140 
much lower the silence and you it'll be
harder<00:05:02.010> to<00:05:02.039> hear<00:05:02.220> the<00:05:02.370> zombies<00:05:02.789> I<00:05:02.910> don't<00:05:03.060> know

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
harder to hear the zombies I don't know

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.969 
harder to hear the zombies I don't know
how<00:05:03.270> it's<00:05:03.449> going<00:05:03.570> to<00:05:03.630> work<00:05:03.690> on<00:05:04.050> the<00:05:04.560> nerve<00:05:04.770> been

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
how it's going to work on the nerve been

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:06.350 
how it's going to work on the nerve been
in<00:05:05.070> the<00:05:05.130> moon<00:05:05.310> don't<00:05:05.880> know<00:05:05.970> how<00:05:06.090> the<00:05:06.150> moon

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
in the moon don't know how the moon

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.170 
in the moon don't know how the moon
works<00:05:06.630> in<00:05:07.050> real<00:05:07.260> life<00:05:07.440> so<00:05:07.830> can't<00:05:08.729> really<00:05:08.820> tell
