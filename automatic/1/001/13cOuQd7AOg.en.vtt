00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.560
 hello today we are going to prepare a delicious 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:08.620
 the dessert called leche asada 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:11.830
 ingredients are 5 eggs a jar of 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.310
 condensed milk milk sugar water and 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.880
 essence 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:19.960
 the first thing we have to do is take the 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.960
 sugar to a container 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.430
 then we went to throw the water 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.920
 we do not learn at a slow fire 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:41.160
 while it warms over a low heat we pass 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.160
 here to prepare in the blender 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.120
 ah 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.000
 we invert the egg whites 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.300
 we warn production 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.300
 today 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:05.109
 we invert the condensed milk 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.109
 many good caregivers too 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.590
 one 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.970
 we cover them well because we are not going to 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.970
 have a bit of right 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.580
 caracas for 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.280
 [Music] 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.490
 come on and we put it to liquefy 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.650
 how 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.479
 we wait for other colors 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.049
 we went a bit of candelaria so that 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.049
 we have 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.360
 when we look at our mix 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:13.160
 we want that we are already scattering it 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:17.140
 our container is scattered that 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.140
 it's enough to turn off 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.000
 we go here to 20 milk in this network of 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.390
 condensed milk that is the same 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.500
 amount that we add 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.500
 at first 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.770
 aggregates 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.160
 the hubble and 4 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:55.560
 we have let's add the yolks 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.560
 we add the yolks 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.920
 and we add a few drops of essence 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:13.760
 let's go back to the blender 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.760
 and we proceed with 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.900
 we hope you try to enter 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.640
 we give it a little more speed 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.620
 so 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.080
 we had 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.080
 [Music] 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.330
 but for our editor 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.060
 let's say that a mixture we have 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:15.849
 how good 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.849
 We bring our mold and spread 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.860
 and we have fun mixing in the mold 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.310
 you are 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:39.190
 Now we put our mold in the oven 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.190
 at 270 degrees for 45 minutes 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.529
 [Music] 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:55.900
 we waited 45 minutes and then about 45 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:55.900
 minutes we proceed to take 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.820
 let's take it apart 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:16.460
 but finally we serve it and what 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.460
 accompanied with a rich sweet blackberry
