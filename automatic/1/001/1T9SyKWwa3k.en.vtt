coming<00:00:26.760> with<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.660> glass<00:00:27.930> TR<00:00:28.230> they<00:00:28.410> have<00:00:28.590> in<00:00:28.800> a

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
coming with the glass TR they have in a

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.880 
coming with the glass TR they have in a
swab<00:00:30.420> with<00:00:31.790> some<00:00:33.260> what<00:00:34.260> do<00:00:34.320> you<00:00:34.380> call<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.559> like

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
swab with some what do you call it like

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.280

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
I guess rubbing alcohol on it or some

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.020 
I guess rubbing alcohol on it or some
sort<00:00:37.500> so<00:00:37.590> we're<00:00:38.160> gonna<00:00:38.280> be<00:00:38.430> able<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.670> wipe<00:00:39.000> away

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
sort so we're gonna be able to wipe away

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.290 
sort so we're gonna be able to wipe away
any<00:00:39.690> grime<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.620> might<00:00:41.100> be<00:00:41.370> on<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.700> we<00:00:42.149> have<00:00:42.270> a

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
any grime that might be on it we have a

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.150 
any grime that might be on it we have a
squeegee<00:00:42.660> in<00:00:42.989> case<00:00:43.230> there<00:00:43.469> are<00:00:43.500> any<00:00:43.649> bubbles

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
squeegee in case there are any bubbles

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.700 
squeegee in case there are any bubbles
so<00:00:45.120> we're<00:00:45.300> going<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.480> be<00:00:45.570> using<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:46.140> I<00:00:46.440> am

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
so we're going to be using that I am

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.470 
so we're going to be using that I am
sure<00:00:47.160> because<00:00:47.640> I'm<00:00:47.760> not<00:00:47.850> professional<00:00:48.420> at

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
sure because I'm not professional at

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.240 
sure because I'm not professional at
applying<00:00:48.870> these<00:00:49.079> we<00:00:49.680> have<00:00:49.770> some<00:00:49.920> jelly

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
applying these we have some jelly

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.680 
applying these we have some jelly
buttons<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.789> came<00:00:50.940> with<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.090> but<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.300> won't<00:00:51.539> be

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
buttons that came with it but I won't be

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.479 
buttons that came with it but I won't be
using<00:00:51.899> these<00:00:52.219> because<00:00:53.219> they<00:00:53.370> are<00:00:53.399> not

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
using these because they are not

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.700 
using these because they are not
compatible<00:00:54.059> with<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.480> iphone<00:00:54.809> 5s<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.530> use

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
compatible with the iphone 5s and I use

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.319 
compatible with the iphone 5s and I use
the<00:00:55.739> touch<00:00:56.039> ID<00:00:56.280> while<00:00:56.550> they<00:00:56.640> are<00:00:56.760> compatible

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
the touch ID while they are compatible

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.130 
the touch ID while they are compatible
but<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.949> would<00:00:59.129> block<00:00:59.460> my<00:00:59.969> touch<00:01:00.270> ID<00:01:00.539> from

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
but it would block my touch ID from

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.139 
but it would block my touch ID from
functioning<00:01:01.710> correctly<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:02.609> will<00:01:02.879> not<00:01:03.000> be

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
functioning correctly so I will not be

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.250 
functioning correctly so I will not be
using<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.510> jelly<00:01:03.719> buttons<00:01:04.049> I'll<00:01:04.140> probably

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
using a jelly buttons I'll probably

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.420 
using a jelly buttons I'll probably
given<00:01:04.650> them<00:01:04.739> my<00:01:04.830> brother<00:01:05.070> or<00:01:05.220> something

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
given them my brother or something

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.630 
given them my brother or something
