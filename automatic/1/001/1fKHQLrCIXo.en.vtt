00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
as opposed to a logical reaction and it

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.819 
as opposed to a logical reaction and it
can<00:00:41.820> be<00:00:42.000> kind<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.420> tricky<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.960> overcome<00:00:43.590> I<00:00:43.620> mean

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
can be kind of tricky to overcome I mean

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.950

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
if it was all logical and I could simply

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.869 
if it was all logical and I could simply
just<00:00:46.170> say<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.620> if<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:47.250> tilt<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.760> will

game is an individual game unaffected by
your<00:01:44.399> past<00:01:44.700> just<00:01:45.299> take<00:01:45.659> each<00:01:45.840> game<00:01:46.350> as<00:01:46.530> they

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070

come<00:01:47.399> think<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.149> like<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.509> have<00:01:48.659> a

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
come think of it like you have a

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.319 
come think of it like you have a
standard<00:01:49.530> six-sided<00:01:50.130> dice<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:51.000> want<00:01:51.180> to

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
standard six-sided dice and you want to

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.260 
standard six-sided dice and you want to
roll<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.810> three<00:01:52.380> on<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:53.100> dice<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.610> chance<00:01:54.119> of

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
roll a three on that dice a chance of

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.330 
roll a three on that dice a chance of
you<00:01:54.390> rolling<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.780> three<00:01:55.110> are<00:01:55.320> one<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:56.070> six

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
you rolling a three are one in six

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.709 
you rolling a three are one in six
because<00:01:56.610> obviously<00:01:56.729> there<00:01:57.240> are<00:01:57.390> six

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
because obviously there are six

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.480 
because obviously there are six
different<00:01:58.049> options<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.710> can<00:01:59.009> hit<00:01:59.310> and

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
different options that you can hit and

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.480 
different options that you can hit and
each<00:01:59.880> hit<00:02:00.180> has<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.899> equal<00:02:01.500> opportunity<00:02:02.250> equal

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
each hit has a equal opportunity equal

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.910 
each hit has a equal opportunity equal
possibility<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.450> landing<00:02:03.930> basically<00:02:04.740> this

possibility of landing basically this

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.080 
possibility of landing basically this
means<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.250> by<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.460> time<00:02:05.759> you've<00:02:05.880> landed

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
means that by the time you've landed

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.020 
means that by the time you've landed
your<00:02:06.630> sixth<00:02:07.200> roll<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.799> should<00:02:08.190> have<00:02:08.550> hit<00:02:08.819> on<00:02:09.000> a

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
your sixth roll you should have hit on a

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.229 
your sixth roll you should have hit on a
three<00:02:09.509> at<00:02:09.720> least<00:02:10.170> once<00:02:10.950> however<00:02:11.670> if<00:02:12.000> you<00:02:12.120> have

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
three at least once however if you have

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.640 
three at least once however if you have
rolled<00:02:12.480> five<00:02:12.810> times

rolled five times

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.350 
rolled five times
got<00:02:13.980> that<00:02:14.099> three<00:02:14.459> but<00:02:14.640> you've<00:02:14.730> got<00:02:14.909> every

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
got that three but you've got every

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:30.629 
reacting better stuff like that in

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:32.000 
reacting better stuff like that in
addition<00:03:31.319> you<00:03:31.440> also<00:03:31.590> want<00:03:31.829> to<00:03:31.859> be

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
addition you also want to be

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.530 
addition you also want to be
acknowledging<00:03:32.669> the<00:03:32.849> things<00:03:33.090> that<00:03:33.299> you<00:03:33.389> are

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.599 
acknowledging the things that you are
doing<00:03:33.720> well<00:03:34.139> so<00:03:34.620> you<00:03:34.680> can<00:03:34.919> do<00:03:35.069> more<00:03:35.310> of<00:03:35.370> them

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
doing well so you can do more of them

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:37.849 
doing well so you can do more of them
doing<00:03:36.180> this<00:03:36.419> not<00:03:36.659> only<00:03:36.720> helps<00:03:36.959> you<00:03:37.169> improve<00:03:37.290> by
