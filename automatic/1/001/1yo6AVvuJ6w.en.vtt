00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
it because they currently use a Google

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.080 
it because they currently use a Google
TV<00:02:55.840> in<00:02:55.959> their<00:02:56.079> bedroom<00:02:56.440> and<00:02:56.620> I'm<00:02:57.519> honestly<00:02:58.030> not

a<00:02:58.239> fan<00:02:58.450> of<00:02:58.480> Google<00:02:58.810> TV<00:02:59.079> it's<00:02:59.200> so<00:02:59.379> clunky<00:02:59.680> and

00:02:59.879 --> 00:02:59.889 
a fan of Google TV it's so clunky and

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:03.059 
a fan of Google TV it's so clunky and
ugly<00:03:00.370> and<00:03:00.569> just<00:03:01.569> my<00:03:01.720> opinion<00:03:02.109> and<00:03:02.319> the<00:03:02.829> Apple

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
ugly and just my opinion and the Apple

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.580 
ugly and just my opinion and the Apple
TV<00:03:03.340> I<00:03:03.370> think<00:03:03.849> it's<00:03:04.450> just<00:03:04.540> much<00:03:05.109> more<00:03:05.409> of<00:03:05.530> a

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590
