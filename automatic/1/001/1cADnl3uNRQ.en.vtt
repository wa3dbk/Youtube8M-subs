00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.370
 hello I thought I'll show you 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.480
 today from my collection 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:13.139
 the dvd collection to the godfather included 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.240
 of course the partner 1 2 and 3 that 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.600
 whole here in this nice red 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.730
 Pappschuber of a little bit on 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.000
 leather is trimmed so you can see this 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.439
 grain I hope you see it is and 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:33.149
 then this cute golden on this 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:34.710
 The whole thing as I said in a very 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.390
 simply designed but very pretty 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:43.290
 box at the back also kept simple 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:48.180
 The party 2 comes as is up 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.620
 two discs distributed the pate 3 could 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.649
 unfortunately not quite the expectations 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.510
 the first two parts really 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.949
 absolute classics are fulfilling 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.270
 I was very sorry I was 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.329
 certainly disappointed 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.780
 after the visit to the cinema also in the 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.100
 German version is extremely annoying that 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.430
 11 appeared only a very different 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.189
 Sync is sync voice 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.520
 I also found not nice 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.770
 similar to the one known from the series 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.960
 in the third part is already ne kleene 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.610
 [Music] 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.130
 alias bruce willis also with a whole 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.060
 other sync voice so what the 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.650
 fun at the movie significantly reduces now well into 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.900
 Unfortunately, my version is so that the 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.610
 that the inner part is very loose so 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.950
 the halt unless the box from the 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.630
 Take the shelf for me 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.180
 That's why I always have that way 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.680
 parking strip in it 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.790
 so that does not fall out these are 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.310
 not included now 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:51.870
 the whole time away if we old china 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:58.680
 it comes down to a few years older 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:02:02.470
 marlon brando in the godfather and of course 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.090
 robert de niro I now in the first 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:14.800
 moment did not really recognize 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:17.140
 keep apart and its mass on as 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.560
 said a lot of dvds part 2 is on two 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:26.110
 distributed dvds 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:30.489
 behind the dvds nothing hides anymore 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.590
 simple but a really nice box 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.450
 I think and is on the small flaw 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.540
 that all parts that the box of or 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.880
 The content of the shoe falls house the 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.989
 It's a bit annoying, but that's the way it is 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.980
 namely the box then again 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.959
 not off the shelf and yes what should I 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.310
 still say look at me now think so 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.170
 times to buy new should they should too 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.950
 blu-ray yet again a lot better 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.660
 look a little better but also 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.110
 partially re-synced if I have it 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.989
 I have it right in my mind 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.000
 not so with new synchronization though 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.920
 Okay, I'll be at the first one 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.150
 dvd collection, the rich stay that way 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.840
 Often I watch the movies then synonymous 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.290
 again not on 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.980
 let's see how good that 's about it 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.980
 I thank myself
