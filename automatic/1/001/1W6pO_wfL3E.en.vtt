00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
be more of a benefit than a problem

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.859 
be more of a benefit than a problem
probably<00:01:26.250> due<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.700> rains<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.659> it's

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
probably due to the rains that it's

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.359 
probably due to the rains that it's
likely<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.259> bring<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.740> islands<00:01:29.100> here<00:01:29.250> and

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
likely to bring to the islands here and

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.280 
likely to bring to the islands here and
they<00:01:29.430> sorely<00:01:29.759> need<00:01:30.060> rain<00:01:30.329> so<00:01:30.869> this<00:01:31.020> storm

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
they sorely need rain so this storm

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.130 
they sorely need rain so this storm
hopefully<00:01:31.770> going<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.130> be<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.729> greater<00:01:33.360> bringer

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
hopefully going to be a greater bringer

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.679
