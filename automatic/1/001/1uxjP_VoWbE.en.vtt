00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
right we're going to sharpen up a

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.480 
right we're going to sharpen up a
straight<00:00:06.600> pointed<00:00:06.990> hook<00:00:07.200> here<00:00:07.440> first<00:00:08.370> of<00:00:08.429> all

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
straight pointed hook here first of all

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.770 
straight pointed hook here first of all
I'm<00:00:08.550> going<00:00:08.639> to<00:00:08.700> put<00:00:08.849> it<00:00:08.940> in<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.120> vise<00:00:09.330> now<00:00:09.750> a

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
I'm going to put it in the vise now a

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.419 
I'm going to put it in the vise now a
lot<00:00:10.019> of<00:00:10.050> people<00:00:10.410> when<00:00:10.530> they<00:00:10.559> first<00:00:10.860> will<00:00:11.309> put

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
lot of people when they first will put

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.640 
lot of people when they first will put
the<00:00:11.490> hook<00:00:11.639> in<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:11.820> vise<00:00:11.849> they<00:00:12.210> tend<00:00:12.480> to<00:00:12.570> put<00:00:13.559> it

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
the hook in the vise they tend to put it

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.039 
the hook in the vise they tend to put it
in<00:00:13.769> far<00:00:14.070> too<00:00:14.099> high<00:00:14.429> up<00:00:14.900> basically<00:00:15.900> what<00:00:15.990> you

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
in far too high up basically what you

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.880 
in far too high up basically what you
need<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.289> do<00:00:16.410> you<00:00:16.560> need<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.880> clamp<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.150> hook

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
need to do you need to clamp the hook

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.700 
need to do you need to clamp the hook
nice<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.189> low<00:00:20.930> what<00:00:21.930> that<00:00:22.080> does<00:00:22.230> it<00:00:22.380> stops<00:00:22.619> you

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
nice and low what that does it stops you

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.050 
nice and low what that does it stops you
from<00:00:22.740> having<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:23.189> lot<00:00:23.340> of<00:00:23.369> push<00:00:23.609> off<00:00:23.760> when<00:00:23.939> you

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
from having a lot of push off when you

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.670 
from having a lot of push off when you
file<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.480> but<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.720> also<00:00:24.840> allows<00:00:25.199> you<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.410> use

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
file it but it also allows you to use

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.490 
file it but it also allows you to use
this<00:00:25.800> top<00:00:26.070> face<00:00:26.369> as<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:27.240> guide<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:28.109> get<00:00:28.260> nice

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
this top face as a guide to get nice

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.310 
this top face as a guide to get nice
straight<00:00:28.890> strokes<00:00:29.570> right<00:00:30.570> we're<00:00:30.779> going<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:30.990> do

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
straight strokes right we're going to do

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.260 
straight strokes right we're going to do
the<00:00:31.410> three-sided<00:00:32.040> method<00:00:32.399> so<00:00:32.969> we're<00:00:33.090> going<00:00:33.180> to

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
the three-sided method so we're going to

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.880 
the three-sided method so we're going to
work<00:00:33.390> on<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.600> two<00:00:33.750> sides<00:00:34.050> first<00:00:34.440> of<00:00:34.590> all<00:00:34.710> and

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
work on the two sides first of all and

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.880 
work on the two sides first of all and
then<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:36.360> top<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.750> hook<00:00:36.930> I'm<00:00:37.710> going<00:00:37.770> to

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
then the top of the hook I'm going to

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.430 
then the top of the hook I'm going to
start<00:00:38.129> off<00:00:38.250> with<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.489> ESPE<00:00:38.820> max<00:00:39.059> file<00:00:39.440> then

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
start off with the ESPE max file then

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.200 
start off with the ESPE max file then
it's<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.649> high<00:00:40.770> speed<00:00:41.040> steel<00:00:41.340> file<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.090> it's

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
it's a high speed steel file and it's

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.840 
it's a high speed steel file and it's
designed<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.690> remove<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.640> reasonable<00:00:44.640> amount

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
designed to remove a reasonable amount

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.910 
designed to remove a reasonable amount
of<00:00:44.910> material<00:00:45.570> quite<00:00:45.780> quickly<00:00:46.020> we'll<00:00:46.739> finish

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
of material quite quickly we'll finish

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.260 
of material quite quickly we'll finish
it<00:00:47.160> off<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.430> really<00:00:47.520> hone<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.940> point<00:00:48.149> with

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
it off and really hone the point with

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.660 
it off and really hone the point with
the<00:00:48.329> stones<00:00:48.570> later<00:00:49.010> so<00:00:50.010> I'm<00:00:50.250> going<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.430> start

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
the stones later so I'm going to start

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.810 
the stones later so I'm going to start
off<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.180> work<00:00:51.539> this<00:00:51.750> far<00:00:52.260> side<00:00:52.559> now<00:00:52.820> getting

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
off and work this far side now getting

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.880 
off and work this far side now getting
the<00:00:53.879> angle<00:00:54.059> correct<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.930> very<00:00:55.289> important<00:00:55.770> you

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
the angle correct is very important you

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.500 
the angle correct is very important you
want<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.070> work<00:00:56.250> with<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.460> natural<00:00:57.000> angle<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.420> the

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
want to work with a natural angle of the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.389 
want to work with a natural angle of the
hook<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:58.289> don't<00:00:58.500> want<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.800> be<00:00:58.890> too<00:00:59.100> steep

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
hook you don't want it to be too steep

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.290 
hook you don't want it to be too steep
and<00:00:59.960> likewise<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:00.989> don't<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.289> be<00:01:01.500> too<00:01:01.739> shallow

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
and likewise you don't it be too shallow

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.929 
and likewise you don't it be too shallow
again<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.480> want<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.690> try<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:03.960> keep<00:01:04.290> all<00:01:04.530> them

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
again you want to try to keep all them

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:07.310 
again you want to try to keep all them
the<00:01:05.939> removal<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.420> material<00:01:06.960> between<00:01:07.110> the

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
the removal of material between the

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.710 
the removal of material between the
point<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.890> barb<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:09.119> want<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.390> try<00:01:09.659> to

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
point and the barb you want to try to

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.899 
point and the barb you want to try to
avoid<00:01:09.869> coming<00:01:10.350> back<00:01:10.710> around<00:01:11.310> towards<00:01:11.640> the

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
avoid coming back around towards the

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.969 
avoid coming back around towards the
bend<00:01:12.150> because<00:01:12.750> that'll<00:01:13.350> mean<00:01:13.470> your<00:01:13.619> your

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
bend because that'll mean your your

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.590 
bend because that'll mean your your
angle<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.280> too<00:01:14.549> shallow<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.420> could

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
angle is too shallow and you could

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.210 
angle is too shallow and you could
potentially<00:01:15.689> weaken<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.830> bend<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.159> hook

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
potentially weaken the bend of the hook

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.969 
potentially weaken the bend of the hook
which<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:17.729> last<00:01:17.939> thing<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.210> want<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.420> do<00:01:18.979> right

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
which is last thing you want to do right

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.899 
which is last thing you want to do right
so<00:01:20.700> with<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.299> file<00:01:22.400> working<00:01:23.400> with<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.520> natural

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
so with the file working with a natural

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.030 
so with the file working with a natural
angle<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.270> hook<00:01:24.770> working<00:01:25.770> in<00:01:25.860> one

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
angle of the hook working in one

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.120 
angle of the hook working in one
direction<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.700> that's<00:01:26.759> from<00:01:27.000> barb<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.630> point

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
direction and that's from barb to point

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.539 
direction and that's from barb to point
you<00:01:29.130> want<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.420> something<00:01:30.420> around<00:01:31.130> four<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.280> six

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
you want to something around four to six

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.230 
you want to something around four to six
strikes<00:01:33.020> when<00:01:34.020> you've<00:01:34.140> done<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.619> check<00:01:35.240> it

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
strikes when you've done that check it

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.450 
strikes when you've done that check it
with<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.810> eyeglass<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.890> make<00:01:38.100> sure<00:01:38.250> that

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
with the eyeglass and make sure that

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.690 
with the eyeglass and make sure that
you're<00:01:38.579> happy<00:01:38.900> with<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.770> angle<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.369> how<00:01:41.549> much

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
you're happy with the angle and how much

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.149 
you're happy with the angle and how much
material<00:01:42.119> you've<00:01:42.210> removed<00:01:42.540> all<00:01:42.990> right<00:01:43.920> once

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
material you've removed all right once

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.370 
material you've removed all right once
you're<00:01:44.280> happy<00:01:44.369> with<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:45.079> now<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.140> want<00:01:46.350> to

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.440 
you're happy with that now you want to
work<00:01:46.560> on<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.920> opposite<00:01:47.280> side<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.970> again<00:01:48.270> use

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
work on the opposite side and again use

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:55.209 
work on the opposite side and again use
the<00:01:48.540> natural<00:01:48.780> angle<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.350> hook<00:01:53.750> around

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 
the natural angle of the hook around

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:58.670 
the natural angle of the hook around
four<00:01:56.219> or<00:01:56.250> five<00:01:56.549> six<00:01:56.850> strikes<00:01:57.240> now<00:01:58.200> again<00:01:58.560> what

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
four or five six strikes now again what

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.719 
four or five six strikes now again what
I'm<00:01:58.770> going<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:58.920> do<00:01:59.040> before<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.369> look<00:01:59.520> for<00:01:59.670> the

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
I'm going to do before I look for the

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.050 
I'm going to do before I look for the
eyeglass<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.420> just<00:02:00.990> wipe<00:02:01.140> out<00:02:01.290> my<00:02:01.409> jumper<00:02:01.740> and

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
eyeglass I just wipe out my jumper and

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.730 
eyeglass I just wipe out my jumper and
poke<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.210> point<00:02:03.479> through<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.780> jumper<00:02:04.170> that

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
poke the point through the jumper that

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.679 
poke the point through the jumper that
just<00:02:04.950> removes<00:02:05.280> off<00:02:05.490> any<00:02:05.790> dust<00:02:06.390> that'll

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
just removes off any dust that'll

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.630 
just removes off any dust that'll
interfere<00:02:07.110> with<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.920> really<00:02:08.310> looking<00:02:08.520> at

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
interfere with you really looking at

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.059 
interfere with you really looking at
that<00:02:08.670> point<00:02:09.289> closely<00:02:10.289> now<00:02:11.340> where<00:02:12.120> I'm

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
that point closely now where I'm

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.149 
that point closely now where I'm
filing<00:02:13.909> the<00:02:14.030> two<00:02:14.209> sides<00:02:14.900> you<00:02:15.799> want<00:02:15.980> to<00:02:16.040> make

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:16.159 
filing the two sides you want to make

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:18.640 
filing the two sides you want to make
sure<00:02:16.189> that<00:02:16.549> the<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:17.780> two<00:02:17.989> sides<00:02:18.260> come<00:02:18.530> to

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
sure that the the two sides come to

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.050 
sure that the the two sides come to
intersect<00:02:19.129> and<00:02:19.370> make<00:02:19.519> sure<00:02:19.670> you<00:02:19.760> don't<00:02:19.879> leave

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
intersect and make sure you don't leave

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.119 
intersect and make sure you don't leave
any<00:02:20.299> of<00:02:20.329> the<00:02:20.389> original<00:02:20.810> point<00:02:21.139> left<00:02:21.379> and<00:02:21.650> to

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
any of the original point left and to

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:24.550 
any of the original point left and to
check<00:02:22.370> that<00:02:22.639> you<00:02:22.760> need<00:02:22.939> to<00:02:23.060> look<00:02:23.209> down<00:02:23.480> on<00:02:24.170> top

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
check that you need to look down on top

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.190 
check that you need to look down on top
of<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.739> hook<00:02:25.120> so<00:02:26.120> you<00:02:26.209> need<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.569> really<00:02:26.959> focus

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
of the hook so you need to really focus

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.220 
of the hook so you need to really focus
in<00:02:27.799> on<00:02:27.980> that<00:02:28.639> point<00:02:28.909> and<00:02:29.569> make<00:02:29.780> sure<00:02:30.019> that

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
in on that point and make sure that

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.690 
in on that point and make sure that
you're<00:02:30.500> happy<00:02:30.650> those<00:02:30.889> two<00:02:31.099> sides<00:02:31.370> have<00:02:31.519> come

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
you're happy those two sides have come

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.699 
you're happy those two sides have come
together<00:02:32.049> once<00:02:33.049> you've<00:02:33.139> been<00:02:33.200> happy<00:02:33.560> with

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
together once you've been happy with

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.830 
together once you've been happy with
that<00:02:33.889> you<00:02:34.639> need<00:02:34.819> to<00:02:34.939> work<00:02:35.120> on<00:02:35.269> the<00:02:35.359> top<00:02:35.569> face

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
that you need to work on the top face

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.830 
that you need to work on the top face
and<00:02:36.139> again<00:02:37.299> you<00:02:38.299> need<00:02:38.389> to<00:02:38.510> look<00:02:38.599> at<00:02:38.719> the

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
and again you need to look at the

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.349 
and again you need to look at the
natural<00:02:39.079> angle<00:02:39.379> of<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.650> hook<00:02:39.859> and<00:02:40.150> this<00:02:41.150> time

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:41.359 
natural angle of the hook and this time

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:43.750 
natural angle of the hook and this time
I'll<00:02:41.510> use<00:02:41.540> my<00:02:41.900> finger<00:02:42.230> as<00:02:42.319> a<00:02:42.349> guide<00:02:42.609> with<00:02:43.609> the

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
I'll use my finger as a guide with the

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.539 
I'll use my finger as a guide with the
file<00:02:44.030> so<00:02:45.909> I'll<00:02:46.909> start<00:02:47.269> off<00:02:47.389> with<00:02:48.459> four<00:02:49.459> or<00:02:49.519> five

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
file so I'll start off with four or five

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:54.550 
file so I'll start off with four or five
strokes<00:02:50.060> and<00:02:50.329> then<00:02:50.989> check<00:02:51.349> it<00:02:51.909> again<00:02:53.290> just<00:02:54.290> put

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
strokes and then check it again just put

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.890 
strokes and then check it again just put
the<00:02:54.650> point<00:02:54.889> through<00:02:55.099> me<00:02:55.219> jumper<00:02:55.609> and<00:02:56.030> now<00:02:56.659> this

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
the point through me jumper and now this

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.110 
the point through me jumper and now this
time<00:02:57.139> because<00:02:57.319> I'm<00:02:57.669> sharpening<00:02:58.669> the<00:02:58.790> top<00:02:59.000> of

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
time because I'm sharpening the top of

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.000 
time because I'm sharpening the top of
the<00:02:59.180> hook<00:02:59.389> you<00:03:00.109> want<00:03:00.199> to<00:03:00.319> look<00:03:00.439> from<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.739> site

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
the hook you want to look from the site

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.610 
the hook you want to look from the site
and<00:03:01.310> you<00:03:01.430> want<00:03:01.639> to<00:03:01.730> see<00:03:01.939> that<00:03:02.209> that<00:03:03.139> top<00:03:03.379> face

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
and you want to see that that top face

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.409 
and you want to see that that top face
come<00:03:03.889> down<00:03:04.099> to<00:03:04.340> a<00:03:04.370> real<00:03:04.669> dead<00:03:05.299> sharp<00:03:05.870> point<00:03:07.419> all

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:08.419 
come down to a real dead sharp point all

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:09.879 
come down to a real dead sharp point all
right<00:03:08.510> not<00:03:08.780> quite<00:03:08.810> there<00:03:09.230> it's<00:03:09.650> worst

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:09.889 
right not quite there it's worst

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:11.800 
right not quite there it's worst
important<00:03:10.400> to<00:03:10.760> do<00:03:10.879> a<00:03:10.909> little<00:03:11.150> bit<00:03:11.269> of<00:03:11.359> work<00:03:11.510> and

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
important to do a little bit of work and

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:18.569 
important to do a little bit of work and
then<00:03:12.409> check<00:03:12.739> it<00:03:12.769> with<00:03:12.949> the<00:03:13.010> eyeglass<00:03:17.139> right

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
then check it with the eyeglass right

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:21.429 
then check it with the eyeglass right
we're<00:03:19.579> pretty<00:03:19.790> much<00:03:20.000> there<00:03:20.269> now<00:03:20.299> so<00:03:21.139> now<00:03:21.290> what

00:03:21.429 --> 00:03:21.439 
we're pretty much there now so now what

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:23.499 
we're pretty much there now so now what
I'm<00:03:21.530> going<00:03:21.560> to<00:03:21.739> do<00:03:22.030> I'm<00:03:23.030> going<00:03:23.180> to<00:03:23.239> go<00:03:23.329> through

00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:23.509 
I'm going to do I'm going to go through

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:25.780 
I'm going to do I'm going to go through
exactly<00:03:23.840> the<00:03:24.019> same<00:03:24.109> processes<00:03:24.889> again<00:03:25.099> but

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
exactly the same processes again but

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.089 
exactly the same processes again but
this<00:03:25.879> time<00:03:25.939> with<00:03:26.569> a<00:03:26.599> style<00:03:26.959> and<00:03:27.439> this<00:03:27.919> will

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
this time with a style and this will

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:29.439 
this time with a style and this will
improve<00:03:28.340> the<00:03:28.519> finish<00:03:28.790> and<00:03:28.879> it'll<00:03:29.030> also<00:03:29.150> allow

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:29.449 
improve the finish and it'll also allow

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:31.539 
improve the finish and it'll also allow
you<00:03:29.509> to<00:03:29.629> hone<00:03:29.900> that<00:03:30.109> point<00:03:30.409> really<00:03:31.220> really

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
you to hone that point really really

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.349 
you to hone that point really really
sharp<00:03:32.229> whereas<00:03:33.229> with<00:03:33.409> the<00:03:33.530> file<00:03:33.970> you<00:03:34.970> can<00:03:35.090> only

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
sharp whereas with the file you can only

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:37.420 
sharp whereas with the file you can only
work<00:03:35.599> in<00:03:35.780> one<00:03:35.810> direction<00:03:36.079> if<00:03:36.590> you<00:03:37.009> need<00:03:37.189> to

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
work in one direction if you need to

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.039 
work in one direction if you need to
with<00:03:37.609> these<00:03:37.729> stones<00:03:37.939> you<00:03:38.209> can<00:03:38.449> actually<00:03:38.659> come

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
with these stones you can actually come

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:46.809 
with these stones you can actually come
back<00:03:39.290> in<00:03:40.129> both<00:03:40.579> directions<00:03:41.709> so<00:03:45.009> again<00:03:46.009> four<00:03:46.759> or

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
back in both directions so again four or

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:48.819 
back in both directions so again four or
five<00:03:47.030> strikes<00:03:47.389> using<00:03:48.049> the<00:03:48.290> top<00:03:48.470> of<00:03:48.590> the<00:03:48.650> Vice

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
five strikes using the top of the Vice

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.059 
five strikes using the top of the Vice
as<00:03:49.189> a<00:03:49.400> rest

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
as a rest

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.249 
as a rest
nice<00:03:52.069> straight<00:03:52.489> strokes<00:03:53.019> again<00:03:54.019> the<00:03:54.109> angle

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:54.259 
nice straight strokes again the angle

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:59.679 
nice straight strokes again the angle
right<00:03:56.979> right<00:03:57.979> at<00:03:58.069> the<00:03:58.159> point<00:03:58.599> push<00:03:59.599> you

00:03:59.679 --> 00:03:59.689 
right right at the point push you

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:01.240 
right right at the point push you
through<00:03:59.840> the<00:03:59.989> jumper<00:04:00.379> and<00:04:00.500> again<00:04:01.069> look

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
through the jumper and again look

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.619 
through the jumper and again look
directly<00:04:01.549> down<00:04:01.879> on<00:04:02.030> the<00:04:02.090> point<00:04:02.299> this<00:04:02.389> width

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:02.629 
directly down on the point this width

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:04.149 
directly down on the point this width
now<00:04:03.259> you're<00:04:03.439> finishing<00:04:03.799> it<00:04:03.859> off<00:04:03.949> with<00:04:03.979> the

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:04.159 
now you're finishing it off with the

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:07.749 
now you're finishing it off with the
stones<00:04:04.430> you<00:04:04.639> really<00:04:05.269> want<00:04:05.509> to<00:04:05.889> focus<00:04:06.889> in<00:04:07.219> right

00:04:07.749 --> 00:04:07.759 
stones you really want to focus in right

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:10.179 
stones you really want to focus in right
on<00:04:07.969> that<00:04:08.120> point<00:04:08.419> and<00:04:09.079> make<00:04:09.229> sure<00:04:09.469> it's<00:04:09.709> really

00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:10.189 
on that point and make sure it's really

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:12.550 
on that point and make sure it's really
really<00:04:10.489> sharp<00:04:10.729> just<00:04:11.539> a<00:04:11.659> couple<00:04:11.930> more<00:04:12.139> strokes

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
really sharp just a couple more strokes

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:21.279 
really sharp just a couple more strokes
on<00:04:12.799> there<00:04:15.219> again<00:04:16.219> just<00:04:16.940> wipe<00:04:17.120> it<00:04:17.329> off<00:04:20.260> like<00:04:21.260> a

00:04:26.929 --> 00:04:26.939 
just got to finish off the top face so

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:28.520 
just got to finish off the top face so
first<00:04:27.210> of<00:04:27.300> all<00:04:27.360> now<00:04:27.960> I'm<00:04:28.080> going<00:04:28.229> to<00:04:28.289> look<00:04:28.349> from

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
first of all now I'm going to look from

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.670 
first of all now I'm going to look from
the<00:04:28.650> side<00:04:28.889> and<00:04:29.930> where<00:04:30.930> it<00:04:31.020> looks<00:04:31.169> really<00:04:31.500> shot

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
the side and where it looks really shot

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.800 
the side and where it looks really shot
from<00:04:31.800> the<00:04:31.919> top<00:04:32.189> you<00:04:32.879> can<00:04:33.060> see<00:04:33.270> it's<00:04:33.479> not<00:04:33.750> quite

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
from the top you can see it's not quite

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.499 
from the top you can see it's not quite
a<00:04:34.050> shot<00:04:34.379> from<00:04:34.500> the<00:04:34.680> side<00:04:34.889> because<00:04:35.009> we<00:04:35.189> haven't

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:35.509 
a shot from the side because we haven't

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:38.929 
a shot from the side because we haven't
finished<00:04:36.509> the<00:04:37.050> top<00:04:37.259> face<00:04:37.530> yet<00:04:37.800> so<00:04:38.699> again

00:04:38.929 --> 00:04:38.939 
finished the top face yet so again

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:42.170 
finished the top face yet so again
exactly<00:04:39.240> same<00:04:39.629> process<00:04:40.199> so<00:04:41.099> we've<00:04:41.219> done<00:04:41.430> with

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
exactly same process so we've done with

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:49.219 
exactly same process so we've done with
a<00:04:42.210> file<00:04:44.060> four<00:04:45.060> or<00:04:45.150> five<00:04:45.330> strikes<00:04:48.110> check<00:04:49.110> it

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:49.229 
a file four or five strikes check it

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:56.950 
a file four or five strikes check it
from<00:04:49.319> the<00:04:49.469> side<00:04:51.800> nearly<00:04:52.800> there

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.149 

I'm<00:04:57.960> not<00:04:58.169> putting<00:04:58.319> a<00:04:58.440> lot<00:04:58.560> of<00:04:58.590> pressure<00:04:58.830> on<00:04:58.949> I'm

00:04:59.149 --> 00:04:59.159 
I'm not putting a lot of pressure on I'm

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:00.619 
I'm not putting a lot of pressure on I'm
letting<00:04:59.400> the<00:04:59.490> stone<00:04:59.789> and<00:05:00.000> the<00:05:00.060> file<00:05:00.270> do<00:05:00.509> the

00:05:00.619 --> 00:05:00.629 
letting the stone and the file do the

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:06.520 
letting the stone and the file do the
work

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.059 

just<00:05:07.530> walk<00:05:07.770> that<00:05:07.919> off<00:05:08.180> right<00:05:09.180> we're<00:05:09.419> there<00:05:09.629> now

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:10.069 
just walk that off right we're there now

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:13.520 
just walk that off right we're there now
one<00:05:11.069> final<00:05:11.520> check<00:05:11.699> from<00:05:11.879> the<00:05:12.000> top<00:05:12.319> and<00:05:13.319> make

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
one final check from the top and make

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.209 
one final check from the top and make
sure<00:05:13.560> it<00:05:13.919> looks<00:05:13.949> sharp<00:05:14.400> from<00:05:14.669> both<00:05:14.940> directions

00:05:16.209 --> 00:05:16.219 
sure it looks sharp from both directions

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:18.740 
sure it looks sharp from both directions
all<00:05:17.219> right<00:05:17.310> one<00:05:17.610> last<00:05:17.789> little<00:05:18.090> thing<00:05:18.210> I'd<00:05:18.449> like

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
all right one last little thing I'd like

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.339 
all right one last little thing I'd like
to<00:05:18.810> do<00:05:19.190> is<00:05:20.190> where<00:05:20.430> you've<00:05:20.550> worked<00:05:21.080> the<00:05:22.080> sides

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:22.349 
to do is where you've worked the sides

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:24.619 
to do is where you've worked the sides
you<00:05:22.710> can<00:05:22.860> get<00:05:23.039> a<00:05:23.069> sharp<00:05:23.430> edge<00:05:23.759> down<00:05:24.120> there<00:05:24.330> so

00:05:24.619 --> 00:05:24.629 
you can get a sharp edge down there so

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:28.279 
you can get a sharp edge down there so
45<00:05:25.289> degrees<00:05:25.680> this<00:05:25.830> time<00:05:26.060> and<00:05:27.060> in<00:05:27.389> these<00:05:27.539> two<00:05:28.139> or

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:28.289 
45 degrees this time and in these two or

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:32.269 
45 degrees this time and in these two or
three<00:05:28.759> strokes<00:05:29.759> on<00:05:30.150> both<00:05:30.779> sides<00:05:31.110> and<00:05:32.069> what

00:05:32.269 --> 00:05:32.279 
three strokes on both sides and what

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:34.040 
three strokes on both sides and what
that<00:05:32.430> does<00:05:32.610> it<00:05:32.849> just<00:05:32.879> takes<00:05:33.419> off<00:05:33.599> that<00:05:33.779> sharp

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
that does it just takes off that sharp

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:41.240 
that does it just takes off that sharp
edge<00:05:36.229> and<00:05:38.210> as<00:05:39.210> long<00:05:39.419> as<00:05:39.449> you<00:05:39.690> get<00:05:39.930> the<00:05:40.740> hook<00:05:40.979> to

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
edge and as long as you get the hook to

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.070 
edge and as long as you get the hook to
look<00:05:41.400> absolutely<00:05:42.089> super<00:05:42.449> sharp<00:05:42.719> from<00:05:42.960> the

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
look absolutely super sharp from the

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.619 
look absolutely super sharp from the
side<00:05:43.379> view<00:05:43.710> and<00:05:43.830> the<00:05:43.919> top<00:05:44.610> view<00:05:44.849> I<00:05:45.029> promise<00:05:45.479> you

00:05:45.619 --> 00:05:45.629 
side view and the top view I promise you

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:47.390 
side view and the top view I promise you
you<00:05:45.870> cannot<00:05:46.319> get<00:05:46.529> a<00:05:46.589> hook<00:05:46.830> point<00:05:47.129> any

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
you cannot get a hook point any

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.849 
you cannot get a hook point any
