bit about what makes this technology

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.330 
bit about what makes this technology
different<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:34.829> special

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
different and special

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.430 
different and special
well<00:00:35.760> this<00:00:36.300> laser<00:00:36.630> it's<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.170> first

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
well this laser it's the first

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.650 
well this laser it's the first
innovation<00:00:37.770> in<00:00:38.250> laser<00:00:38.489> tattoo<00:00:38.820> removal<00:00:39.059> in<00:00:39.540> at

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
innovation in laser tattoo removal in at

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.170 
innovation in laser tattoo removal in at
least<00:00:39.899> 20<00:00:40.350> years<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:41.190> actually<00:00:41.610> fires<00:00:41.879> when<00:00:42.120> I

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
least 20 years it actually fires when I

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.330 
least 20 years it actually fires when I
fire<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.600> laser<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.050> pulse<00:00:43.320> only<00:00:43.710> lasts<00:00:44.070> one

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
fire the laser the pulse only lasts one

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.520 
fire the laser the pulse only lasts one
trillionth<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.180> second<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:46.289> what<00:00:46.410> that

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
trillionth of a second so what that

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.529 
trillionth of a second so what that
means<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.129> energy<00:00:47.489> goes<00:00:47.760> in<00:00:47.940> very<00:00:48.210> quickly

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
means is the energy goes in very quickly

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.630 
means is the energy goes in very quickly
and<00:00:48.780> breaks<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.230> tattoo<00:00:49.649> ink<00:00:49.860> into<00:00:50.190> millions

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
and breaks the tattoo ink into millions

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.850 
and breaks the tattoo ink into millions
of<00:00:50.789> tiny<00:00:51.059> tiny<00:00:51.360> little<00:00:51.570> pieces<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.440> your

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
of tiny tiny little pieces that your

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.610 
of tiny tiny little pieces that your
body<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.219> able<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.610> absorb<00:00:54.059> very<00:00:54.300> quickly<00:00:54.719> so

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
body is able to absorb very quickly so

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.110 
body is able to absorb very quickly so
with<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:55.829> new<00:00:56.070> laser<00:00:56.309> technology<00:00:56.489> we're

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
with this new laser technology we're

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.569 
with this new laser technology we're
seeing<00:00:57.390> improvements<00:00:57.960> in<00:00:58.109> tattoos<00:00:58.829> one

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
seeing improvements in tattoos one

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.930 
seeing improvements in tattoos one
treatment<00:00:59.940> maybe<00:01:00.600> 80%<00:01:01.020> in<00:01:01.710> peeling<00:01:02.370> up<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.760> 80

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
treatment maybe 80% in peeling up to 80

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.729 
treatment maybe 80% in peeling up to 80
percent<00:01:03.180> in<00:01:03.510> one<00:01:03.660> treatment<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.470> we're

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
percent in one treatment and we're

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:05.870 
percent in one treatment and we're
definitely<00:01:04.949> cutting<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.519> number<00:01:05.640> of

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
definitely cutting the number of

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.880 
definitely cutting the number of
treatments<00:01:06.299> down<00:01:06.479> by<00:01:06.659> at<00:01:06.810> least<00:01:06.990> half<00:01:07.260> you're

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
treatments down by at least half you're

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.460 
treatments down by at least half you're
kidding<00:01:08.310> no<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.760> very<00:01:08.939> expensive<00:01:09.570> it's<00:01:10.350> a

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
kidding no is very expensive it's a

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.990 
kidding no is very expensive it's a
little<00:01:10.770> bit<00:01:10.890> more<00:01:11.010> expensive<00:01:11.280> because<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
little bit more expensive because the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000 
little bit more expensive because the
machine<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.360> very<00:01:12.810> expensive<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.979> course

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
machine is very expensive and of course

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.109 
machine is very expensive and of course
we're<00:01:14.340> cutting<00:01:14.549> down<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.790> number<00:01:14.909> of

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
we're cutting down the number of

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.330 
we're cutting down the number of
treatment<00:01:15.509> requirements<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:16.530> forth<00:01:16.920> okay

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
treatment requirements and so forth okay

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.870 
treatment requirements and so forth okay
very<00:01:17.670> good

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
very good

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
how long does the procedure take would

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.440 
how long does the procedure take would
you<00:02:30.769> say<00:02:30.980> at<00:02:31.280> a<00:02:31.340> given<00:02:31.700> any<00:02:31.910> given<00:02:32.180> time<00:02:32.329> you

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
you say at a given any given time you

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.330 
you say at a given any given time you
can<00:02:32.570> see<00:02:32.810> it<00:02:32.900> can<00:02:33.049> take<00:02:33.230> just<00:02:33.380> a<00:02:33.560> few<00:02:33.590> minutes<00:02:34.220> I

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
can see it can take just a few minutes I

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.710 
can see it can take just a few minutes I
mean<00:02:34.459> we<00:02:34.579> can<00:02:34.700> cover<00:02:34.850> a<00:02:35.000> large<00:02:35.180> area<00:02:35.390> very

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
mean we can cover a large area very

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.390 
mean we can cover a large area very
quickly<00:02:35.959> because<00:02:36.290> their<00:02:36.470> laser<00:02:36.829> fires<00:02:37.190> too

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
quickly because their laser fires too

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.699 
quickly because their laser fires too
rapidly<00:02:37.850> yeah<00:02:38.390> now<00:02:38.720> Melissa<00:02:39.850> let's<00:02:40.850> show<00:02:41.120> them

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
rapidly yeah now Melissa let's show them

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.979 
rapidly yeah now Melissa let's show them
this<00:02:42.709> way<00:02:42.860> okay<00:02:43.280> so<00:02:44.000> I<00:02:44.030> just<00:02:44.239> treated<00:02:44.840> this<00:02:44.930> a

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
this way okay so I just treated this a

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.660 
this way okay so I just treated this a
few<00:02:45.260> minutes<00:02:45.380> ago<00:02:45.620> so<00:02:45.950> it<00:02:46.040> is<00:02:46.130> normal<00:02:46.280> to<00:02:46.489> get<00:02:46.640> a

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
few minutes ago so it is normal to get a

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:47.979 
few minutes ago so it is normal to get a
little<00:02:46.910> bit<00:02:47.030> of<00:02:47.120> pinkness<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:47.690> swelling

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
little bit of pinkness and swelling

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.890 
little bit of pinkness and swelling
after<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:48.530> treatment<00:02:49.070> and<00:02:49.570> the<00:02:50.570> reason

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
after the treatment and the reason

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.630 
after the treatment and the reason
Melissa<00:02:51.350> came<00:02:51.560> in<00:02:51.709> was<00:02:51.860> because<00:02:52.160> she<00:02:52.400> had<00:02:52.489> had

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
Melissa came in was because she had had

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.520 
Melissa came in was because she had had
about<00:02:52.910> six<00:02:53.299> or<00:02:53.450> seven<00:02:53.810> treatments<00:02:54.290> with<00:02:54.410> the

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
about six or seven treatments with the

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.130 
about six or seven treatments with the
traditional<00:02:55.070> laser<00:02:55.310> tattoo<00:02:55.910> device<00:02:56.450> and<00:02:56.750> it

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
traditional laser tattoo device and it

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.170 
traditional laser tattoo device and it
stopped<00:02:57.440> working<00:02:57.739> that's<00:02:58.519> the<00:02:58.700> other<00:02:58.850> big

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
stopped working that's the other big

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.699 
stopped working that's the other big
niche<00:02:59.420> for<00:02:59.660> this<00:02:59.780> lasers<00:03:00.230> it'll<00:03:00.500> actually

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
niche for this lasers it'll actually

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.190 
niche for this lasers it'll actually
treat<00:03:01.160> tattoos<00:03:02.150> that<00:03:02.180> aren't<00:03:02.540> responding<00:03:02.930> to

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
treat tattoos that aren't responding to

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.680 
treat tattoos that aren't responding to
the<00:03:03.950> traditional<00:03:04.489> lasers<00:03:04.850> any<00:03:05.060> longer<00:03:05.450> that

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
the traditional lasers any longer that

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.120 
the traditional lasers any longer that
makes<00:03:05.870> sense<00:03:06.079> so<00:03:06.260> it<00:03:06.350> can<00:03:06.500> pick<00:03:06.680> up<00:03:06.829> where<00:03:07.010> the

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
makes sense so it can pick up where the

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.190 
makes sense so it can pick up where the
old<00:03:07.280> lasers<00:03:07.700> left<00:03:07.940> off<00:03:08.150> so<00:03:08.390> to<00:03:08.450> speak<00:03:08.720> why<00:03:08.989> did

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
old lasers left off so to speak why did

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.229 
old lasers left off so to speak why did

this<00:04:38.160> this<00:04:38.490> is<00:04:38.640> the<00:04:38.760> because<00:04:38.940> the<00:04:39.390> ink<00:04:39.540> yeah<00:04:39.870> in

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
this this is the because the ink yeah in

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.430 
this this is the because the ink yeah in
fact<00:04:41.270> most<00:04:42.270> patients<00:04:42.870> I'd<00:04:42.990> say<00:04:43.140> the<00:04:43.260> average

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
fact most patients I'd say the average

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.170 
fact most patients I'd say the average
would<00:04:43.740> be<00:04:43.860> two<00:04:44.070> to<00:04:44.190> three<00:04:44.220> treatments<00:04:44.940> space

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
would be two to three treatments space

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.850 
would be two to three treatments space
maybe<00:04:45.450> a<00:04:45.600> month<00:04:45.900> or<00:04:46.020> two<00:04:46.200> apart<00:04:46.560> and<00:04:46.770> their

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860
