free to move so it can fall now if I'm

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.580 
free to move so it can fall now if I'm
not<00:02:42.830> careful<00:02:43.099> so<00:02:44.030> I'm<00:02:44.090> just<00:02:44.209> gonna<00:02:44.390> twist<00:02:45.230> it

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
not careful so I'm just gonna twist it

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.729 
not careful so I'm just gonna twist it
around<00:02:49.330> you<00:02:50.330> can<00:02:50.360> do<00:02:50.630> the<00:02:50.870> same<00:02:51.050> for<00:02:51.290> all<00:02:51.470> the

around you can do the same for all the
other<00:02:52.330> joints<00:02:53.330> of<00:02:53.450> course<00:02:53.860> and<00:02:54.860> I'm<00:02:55.100> gonna<00:02:55.370> put

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
other joints of course and I'm gonna put

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.350 
other joints of course and I'm gonna put
a<00:02:56.060> pop<00:02:56.360> back<00:02:56.660> on<00:02:57.040> now<00:02:58.100> it's<00:02:58.580> thought<00:02:58.940> in<00:02:59.120> here

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
a pop back on now it's thought in here

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.640 
a pop back on now it's thought in here
now<00:02:59.600> I'm<00:02:59.690> going<00:02:59.810> to<00:02:59.930> transfer<00:03:00.470> it<00:03:00.590> to<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:00.830> left

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
now I'm going to transfer it to the left

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:03.759 
now I'm going to transfer it to the left
okay

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
okay

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.040 
okay
and<00:03:03.860> our<00:03:04.400> final<00:03:04.730> frame<00:03:05.120> I'm<00:03:05.390> just<00:03:05.660> gonna<00:03:05.810> want

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
and our final frame I'm just gonna want

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.290 
and our final frame I'm just gonna want
it<00:03:06.110> to<00:03:06.230> be<00:03:06.319> the<00:03:06.440> same<00:03:06.650> as<00:03:06.860> the<00:03:07.040> first<00:03:07.220> frame<00:03:07.489> so

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
it to be the same as the first frame so

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.500 
it to be the same as the first frame so
it<00:03:08.420> transferred<00:03:08.810> back<00:03:08.989> to<00:03:09.140> a<00:03:09.170> robot<00:03:10.150> and<00:03:11.150> I'll

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
it transferred back to a robot and I'll

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.890 
it transferred back to a robot and I'll
save<00:03:11.989> it<00:03:12.019> to<00:03:12.350> step<00:03:12.680> number<00:03:12.739> three<00:03:13.840> all<00:03:14.840> right

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
save it to step number three all right

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.990 
save it to step number three all right
here<00:03:15.170> at<00:03:15.260> this<00:03:15.410> timing<00:03:15.980> and<00:03:16.160> the<00:03:16.250> pulses<00:03:16.790> you

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
here at this timing and the pulses you

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.960 
here at this timing and the pulses you
can<00:03:17.180> do<00:03:17.390> so<00:03:18.019> time<00:03:18.410> one<00:03:18.890> is<00:03:19.069> slow<00:03:19.370> time<00:03:19.730> zero

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
can do so time one is slow time zero

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.030 
can do so time one is slow time zero
point<00:03:20.180> two<00:03:20.299> is<00:03:20.420> fast<00:03:20.750> and<00:03:21.590> you<00:03:21.680> can<00:03:21.830> make<00:03:21.920> it

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
point two is fast and you can make it

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.699 
point two is fast and you can make it
pause<00:03:22.280> as<00:03:22.549> well<00:03:23.230> okay<00:03:24.230> now<00:03:24.380> I'm<00:03:24.500> going<00:03:24.620> to

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
pause as well okay now I'm going to

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.920 
pause as well okay now I'm going to
let's<00:03:25.400> play<00:03:25.819> the<00:03:25.940> whole<00:03:26.000> thing<00:03:26.090> and<00:03:26.510> see<00:03:26.840> how

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
let's play the whole thing and see how

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:33.740 
let's play the whole thing and see how
it<00:03:27.049> goes

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.940 

okay<00:03:34.530> if<00:03:34.890> I<00:03:35.070> make<00:03:35.250> it<00:03:35.400> faster<00:03:36.560> say<00:03:37.560> I<00:03:37.590> say<00:03:37.920> I

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
okay if I make it faster say I say I

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:44.300 
okay if I make it faster say I say I
make<00:03:38.130> it<00:03:38.310> first<00:03:39.240> one<00:03:39.480> is<00:03:39.690> not<00:03:40.500> pulling<00:03:43.310> three

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
make it first one is not pulling three

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.630 
make it first one is not pulling three
and<00:03:44.810> I<00:03:45.810> make<00:03:46.080> it<00:03:46.230> step<00:03:46.710> two<00:03:46.980> I'll<00:03:47.130> make<00:03:47.280> a<00:03:47.310> pulse

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
and I make it step two I'll make a pulse

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.190 
and I make it step two I'll make a pulse
here<00:03:49.160> you'll<00:03:50.160> expect<00:03:50.580> the<00:03:50.730> first<00:03:51.020> action<00:03:52.020> to

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
here you'll expect the first action to

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.500 
here you'll expect the first action to
be<00:03:52.320> quick<00:03:52.590> and<00:03:52.830> then<00:03:53.430> it<00:03:53.610> will<00:03:53.700> pulse<00:03:54.000> in<00:03:54.240> step

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
be quick and then it will pulse in step

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.840 
be quick and then it will pulse in step
two<00:03:54.750> and<00:03:54.930> then<00:03:55.050> continue<00:03:55.470> so<00:03:56.280> I'm<00:03:56.490> gonna<00:03:56.610> press

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
two and then continue so I'm gonna press

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:02.920 
two and then continue so I'm gonna press
play<00:03:56.880> again

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.170 

there's<00:04:03.930> the<00:04:04.050> pulse<00:04:04.260> and<00:04:05.250> save<00:04:05.550> this<00:04:05.790> to<00:04:06.150> the

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
there's the pulse and save this to the

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
there's the pulse and save this to the
robot<00:04:07.010> so<00:04:08.010> press<00:04:08.220> save<00:04:08.489> and<00:04:09.300> we'll<00:04:09.420> go<00:04:09.540> down<00:04:09.750> to

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
robot so press save and we'll go down to

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.949 
robot so press save and we'll go down to
robot<00:04:11.690> so<00:04:12.690> saving<00:04:14.090> you<00:04:15.090> cannot<00:04:15.330> of<00:04:15.540> course

robot so saving you cannot of course
go<00:04:16.380> save<00:04:17.010> as<00:04:17.160> draft<00:04:17.519> and<00:04:17.820> then<00:04:17.940> save<00:04:18.299> it<00:04:18.419> to<00:04:18.510> a

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
go save as draft and then save it to a

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.180 
go save as draft and then save it to a
file<00:04:18.780> without<00:04:18.959> saving<00:04:19.079> to<00:04:19.440> robots<00:04:19.799> okay

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
file without saving to robots okay

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.099 
file without saving to robots okay
you<00:04:20.700> didn't<00:04:20.910> throw<00:04:21.000> up<00:04:21.090> anything<00:04:21.359> okay<00:04:22.049> so

you didn't throw up anything okay so

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.390 
you didn't throw up anything okay so
this<00:04:22.560> motion<00:04:22.800> is<00:04:23.190> now<00:04:23.400> stored<00:04:23.760> in<00:04:24.419> the<00:04:24.720> robot

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
this motion is now stored in the robot

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:31.070 
this motion is now stored in the robot
let's<00:04:26.400> connect<00:04:27.180> that<00:04:27.210> and<00:04:29.360> now<00:04:30.360> let's<00:04:30.600> turn<00:04:30.900> on

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
let's connect that and now let's turn on

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.790 
let's connect that and now let's turn on
Robo<00:04:31.500> task<00:04:31.800> and<00:04:32.130> write<00:04:32.340> something<00:04:32.580> simple

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
Robo task and write something simple

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.940 
Robo task and write something simple
okay<00:04:34.800> so<00:04:34.860> this<00:04:35.130> robot<00:04:35.430> task<00:04:36.860> okay<00:04:37.860> you

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
okay so this robot task okay you

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.030 
okay so this robot task okay you
double-click<00:04:38.400> it<00:04:38.640> first<00:04:39.390> of<00:04:39.510> all<00:04:39.600> you<00:04:40.040> select

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
double-click it first of all you select

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.010 
double-click it first of all you select
your<00:04:42.110> robot<00:04:43.110> type<00:04:43.380> five<00:04:44.070> one<00:04:44.400> zero<00:04:44.870> so<00:04:45.870> the

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
your robot type five one zero so the

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.020 
your robot type five one zero so the
poor<00:04:46.290> or<00:04:46.680> eight<00:04:47.060> now<00:04:48.060> I<00:04:48.090> can<00:04:48.270> double<00:04:48.510> click<00:04:48.540> and

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
poor or eight now I can double click and

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.420 
poor or eight now I can double click and
this<00:04:51.030> is<00:04:51.210> basically<00:04:51.780> a<00:04:52.290> very<00:04:52.620> simple<00:04:53.280> version

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
this is basically a very simple version

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.000 
this is basically a very simple version
of<00:04:53.840> basic<00:04:54.840> as<00:04:55.140> you<00:04:55.320> if<00:04:55.620> you've<00:04:55.800> done

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
of basic as you if you've done

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.190 
of basic as you if you've done
programming<00:04:56.460> before<00:04:56.729> so<00:04:57.630> it<00:04:57.900> will<00:04:58.020> have

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
programming before so it will have

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.620 
programming before so it will have
you'll<00:04:58.650> need<00:04:58.800> a<00:04:58.830> start<00:04:59.250> and<00:04:59.520> an<00:04:59.880> exit<00:05:00.300> so<00:05:00.540> you

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
you'll need a start and an exit so you

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.659 
you'll need a start and an exit so you
double<00:05:00.870> click<00:05:01.050> it<00:05:01.229> you<00:05:01.919> write<00:05:02.190> that<00:05:02.310> for<00:05:02.550> you

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
double click it you write that for you

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.880 
double click it you write that for you
you<00:05:02.940> want<00:05:03.390> a<00:05:03.510> function<00:05:03.900> go<00:05:04.050> right<00:05:04.229> outside<00:05:04.440> and

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
you want a function go right outside and

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.490 
you want a function go right outside and
you<00:05:04.979> call<00:05:05.190> it<00:05:05.370> and<00:05:06.080> I'll<00:05:07.080> double<00:05:07.320> click<00:05:07.350> again

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:53.650 
okay now let's try it out so I'm gonna

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:58.770 
okay now let's try it out so I'm gonna
now<00:06:54.070> disconnect<00:06:54.910> the<00:06:56.850> serial<00:06:57.850> cable<00:06:58.030> you<00:06:58.600> got

00:06:58.770 --> 00:06:58.780 
now disconnect the serial cable you got

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.560 
now disconnect the serial cable you got
do<00:06:59.200> that<00:06:59.380> in<00:06:59.530> order<00:06:59.710> for<00:06:59.770> the<00:06:59.950> remote<00:07:00.190> to<00:07:00.340> work

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:00.570 
do that in order for the remote to work

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:05.010 
do that in order for the remote to work
so<00:07:01.570> you<00:07:01.990> need<00:07:02.320> to<00:07:02.470> go<00:07:02.650> to<00:07:02.850> the<00:07:03.850> last<00:07:04.060> one<00:07:04.210> and

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:05.020 
so you need to go to the last one and

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.400 
so you need to go to the last one and
press<00:07:05.200> Start<00:07:05.560> and<00:07:06.090> now<00:07:07.090> I've<00:07:07.300> got<00:07:07.630> my<00:07:07.900> remote

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:08.410 
press Start and now I've got my remote

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:12.990 
press Start and now I've got my remote
here<00:07:09.990> go<00:07:10.990> sick<00:07:11.170> B<00:07:11.350> so<00:07:12.340> I'm<00:07:12.400> gonna<00:07:12.520> press<00:07:12.700> one

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:13.000 
here go sick B so I'm gonna press one

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:21.990 
here go sick B so I'm gonna press one
and<00:07:13.180> then<00:07:13.330> the<00:07:13.420> arms<00:07:13.690> gonna<00:07:13.900> move<00:07:14.460> C<00:07:20.790> so<00:07:21.790> this

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:22.000 
and then the arms gonna move C so this

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.330 
and then the arms gonna move C so this
is<00:07:22.150> the<00:07:22.300> basic<00:07:22.750> idea<00:07:22.960> of<00:07:23.470> course<00:07:24.040> you<00:07:24.160> can

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:24.340 
is the basic idea of course you can

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.180 
is the basic idea of course you can
program<00:07:24.580> different<00:07:25.030> motions<00:07:25.920> continues<00:07:26.920> most

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:27.190 
program different motions continues most

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:27.600 
program different motions continues most
rooms

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:27.610 
rooms

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:29.940 
rooms
and<00:07:27.970> you<00:07:28.090> can<00:07:28.240> also<00:07:28.390> put<00:07:28.870> variables<00:07:29.440> from<00:07:29.680> this

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:29.950 
and you can also put variables from this

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:33.030 
and you can also put variables from this
sensors<00:07:30.520> and<00:07:31.450> a<00:07:31.540> gyro<00:07:31.810> sensor<00:07:32.380> so<00:07:32.590> it's<00:07:32.800> like

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:33.040 
sensors and a gyro sensor so it's like

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.700 
sensors and a gyro sensor so it's like
we<00:07:33.580> see<00:07:33.820> an<00:07:33.940> object<00:07:34.180> here<00:07:35.080> this<00:07:35.350> students

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:35.710 
we see an object here this students

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:38.250 
we see an object here this students
dying<00:07:36.040> and<00:07:36.220> you<00:07:36.310> know<00:07:36.400> step<00:07:36.790> back<00:07:37.060> or<00:07:37.690> if<00:07:38.110> you

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:38.260 
dying and you know step back or if you

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.410 
dying and you know step back or if you
say<00:07:38.470> fall<00:07:38.710> down<00:07:38.950> you<00:07:39.220> just<00:07:39.310> draw<00:07:40.030> our<00:07:40.120> sensor

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:40.420 
say fall down you just draw our sensor

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.690 
say fall down you just draw our sensor
sensor<00:07:40.750> then<00:07:41.020> make<00:07:41.470> it<00:07:41.590> stand<00:07:41.860> back<00:07:42.040> up<00:07:42.250> stuff

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:42.700 
sensor then make it stand back up stuff

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:46.440 
sensor then make it stand back up stuff
like<00:07:42.880> that<00:07:43.000> so<00:07:43.570> um<00:07:43.930> the<00:07:45.240> possibility<00:07:46.240> is

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:46.450 
like that so um the possibility is

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:49.770 
like that so um the possibility is
endless<00:07:47.550> okay<00:07:48.550> so<00:07:48.610> here<00:07:49.180> you<00:07:49.240> go<00:07:49.330> let<00:07:49.480> me<00:07:49.570> see

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:49.780 
endless okay so here you go let me see

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.710 
endless okay so here you go let me see
what<00:07:49.960> you<00:07:50.020> think<00:07:50.380> thank<00:07:50.590> you
