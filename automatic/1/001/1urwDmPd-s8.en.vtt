adjust the air shocks on this bike the
rear<00:00:06.990> shocks<00:00:07.290> but<00:00:08.220> before<00:00:08.639> I<00:00:08.670> do<00:00:08.760> that<00:00:08.849> let's

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
rear shocks but before I do that let's

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.940 
rear shocks but before I do that let's
take<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.480> look<00:00:09.719> at<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:09.929> air<00:00:10.349> pump<00:00:10.620> I'm<00:00:10.769> going<00:00:10.889> to

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
take a look at the air pump I'm going to

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.720 
take a look at the air pump I'm going to
use<00:00:11.960> this<00:00:12.960> is<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.170> Harley<00:00:13.679> Davidson<00:00:13.710> air<00:00:14.400> pump

zero zero three a the way that this pump
works<00:00:23.490> is<00:00:23.850> you<00:00:24.570> grab<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.080> handle<00:00:25.580> like<00:00:26.580> so

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
works is you grab the handle like so

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.169 
works is you grab the handle like so
that's<00:00:27.390> how<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:27.630> pump<00:00:27.930> air<00:00:28.140> into<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.529> system

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:29.179 
that's how you pump air into the system

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.460 
that's how you pump air into the system

to carry around a separate gauge to tell
how<00:01:04.409> much<00:01:04.530> pressure<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.189> your<00:01:05.309> rear

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
how much pressure is in your rear

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.350 
how much pressure is in your rear
suspension<00:01:07.010> the<00:01:08.010> Harley<00:01:08.340> pump<00:01:08.549> is<00:01:08.700> very<00:01:08.760> small

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
suspension the Harley pump is very small

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.270 
suspension the Harley pump is very small
and<00:01:09.570> it's<00:01:09.720> only<00:01:09.869> 8<00:01:10.080> inches<00:01:10.350> long<00:01:10.619> which<00:01:10.890> makes

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
and it's only 8 inches long which makes

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.880 
and it's only 8 inches long which makes
it<00:01:11.520> great<00:01:11.729> for<00:01:11.810> being<00:01:12.810> able<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.049> just<00:01:13.650> throw<00:01:13.710> it

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
it great for being able to just throw it

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.890 
it great for being able to just throw it
in<00:01:13.979> your<00:01:14.040> saddlebags<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.850> go

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
in your saddlebags and go

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.270 
in your saddlebags and go
it<00:01:16.140> doesn't<00:01:16.409> take<00:01:16.530> out<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.860> much<00:01:17.040> room

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
it doesn't take out that much room

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.550 
it doesn't take out that much room
another<00:01:18.060> good<00:01:18.299> point<00:01:18.570> about<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.960> being<00:01:19.110> small

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
another good point about it being small

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.649 
another good point about it being small
is<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:20.130> doesn't<00:01:20.310> displace<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.790> lot<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.180> air<00:01:21.330> per

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
is it doesn't displace a lot of air per

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.960 
is it doesn't displace a lot of air per
pump<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.259> that's<00:01:22.979> good<00:01:23.310> because<00:01:23.640> you're<00:01:23.790> less

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
pump and that's good because you're less

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.510 
pump and that's good because you're less
likely<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.600> damage<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.290> rear<00:01:25.740> suspension<00:01:25.920> air

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
likely to damage the rear suspension air

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.330 
likely to damage the rear suspension air
system<00:01:27.000> for<00:01:27.960> example<00:01:28.470> if<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.740> went<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.070> gas

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
system for example if you went to a gas

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.069 
system for example if you went to a gas
station<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.880> tried<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.240> use<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.570> air<00:01:30.750> pump

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
station and tried to use the air pump

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.230 
station and tried to use the air pump
used<00:01:31.409> for<00:01:31.650> putting<00:01:32.220> air<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.670> tires<00:01:32.880> you'd

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
used for putting air and tires you'd

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.840 
used for putting air and tires you'd
probably<00:01:33.630> blow<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.140> seal<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:34.770> your<00:01:34.850> rear

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
probably blow a seal in your rear

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.730 
probably blow a seal in your rear
suspension<00:01:36.450> because<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:37.110> would<00:01:37.229> just<00:01:37.439> force

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
suspension because it would just force

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.950 
suspension because it would just force
too<00:01:38.009> much<00:01:38.189> air<00:01:38.490> into<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.060> system<00:01:39.479> too<00:01:39.659> fast

too much air into the system too fast

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.770 
too much air into the system too fast
and<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.350> would<00:01:40.500> exceed<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.509> you<00:01:42.509> know<00:01:42.630> the

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
and you would exceed the you know the

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.260 
and you would exceed the you know the
maximum<00:01:43.320> psi<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:45.390> system<00:01:45.780> can<00:01:45.960> handle

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
maximum psi that the system can handle

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.260 
maximum psi that the system can handle
just<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.390> give<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.630> an<00:01:48.750> example<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:51.030> size

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
just to give you an example of the size

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.230 
just to give you an example of the size
of<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.570> pump<00:01:52.159> that's<00:01:53.159> another<00:01:53.640> hand<00:01:53.970> pump

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
of the pump that's another hand pump

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.690 
of the pump that's another hand pump
used<00:01:54.509> for<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.720> bicycle<00:01:55.009> this<00:01:56.009> is<00:01:56.219> supposed<00:01:56.579> to

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
used for a bicycle this is supposed to

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.080 
used for a bicycle this is supposed to
be<00:01:56.790> small<00:01:57.320> so<00:01:58.369> you<00:01:59.369> can<00:01:59.399> see<00:01:59.610> just<00:01:59.759> how<00:01:59.880> much

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
be small so you can see just how much

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.630 
be small so you can see just how much
smaller<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.600> Harley<00:02:00.899> pump<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.320> this<00:02:02.159> was<00:02:02.399> this

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
smaller the Harley pump is this was this

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.990 
smaller the Harley pump is this was this
was<00:02:02.820> $10<00:02:03.450> at<00:02:03.719> Walmart<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.979> pump<00:02:05.219> here<00:02:05.729> for

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
was $10 at Walmart and the pump here for

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.809 
was $10 at Walmart and the pump here for
the<00:02:06.090> Harley<00:02:06.390> bike<00:02:06.600> was<00:02:06.810> 1090<00:02:07.320> or<00:02:07.500> 49.95<00:02:08.340> I

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
the Harley bike was 1090 or 49.95 I

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.910 
the Harley bike was 1090 or 49.95 I
think<00:02:09.539> that's<00:02:09.720> steep<00:02:10.080> for<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.379> Harley<00:02:10.709> pump

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
think that's steep for the Harley pump

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.700 
think that's steep for the Harley pump
but<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.540> is<00:02:12.540> a<00:02:12.569> much<00:02:13.020> higher

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
but it is a much higher

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.140 
but it is a much higher
all<00:02:13.800> be<00:02:13.950> pumped<00:02:14.310> in<00:02:14.430> this<00:02:14.580> this<00:02:14.880> other<00:02:15.120> one

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
all be pumped in this this other one

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.310 
all be pumped in this this other one
okay<00:02:18.150> I'll<00:02:18.270> show<00:02:18.450> you<00:02:18.510> how<00:02:18.690> to<00:02:18.720> add<00:02:18.960> air<00:02:19.290> to

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
okay I'll show you how to add air to

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.530 
okay I'll show you how to add air to
your<00:02:19.560> rear<00:02:19.860> suspension<00:02:20.430> system<00:02:20.880> or<00:02:21.090> let<00:02:21.360> air

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
bike just inside of the rear saddlebag

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.240 
bike just inside of the rear saddlebag
it's<00:02:33.990> where<00:02:34.230> my<00:02:34.380> finger<00:02:34.710> is<00:02:34.740> pointing<00:02:37.250> it's

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
it's where my finger is pointing it's

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.250 
it's where my finger is pointing it's
just<00:02:38.520> it's<00:02:38.760> easier<00:02:39.300> just<00:02:39.330> just<00:02:39.900> to<00:02:39.990> remove

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
just it's easier just just to remove

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260 
just it's easier just just to remove
this<00:02:40.470> rear<00:02:40.950> saddlebag<00:02:41.550> so<00:02:41.760> let's<00:02:41.970> do<00:02:42.120> that

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
this rear saddlebag so let's do that

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.270 
this rear saddlebag so let's do that
first<00:02:42.510> before<00:02:42.810> we<00:02:43.430> attach<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.670> pump<00:02:46.220> okay<00:02:47.220> to

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
first before we attach the pump okay to

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.490 
first before we attach the pump okay to
get<00:02:47.490> the<00:02:47.640> left<00:02:48.210> rear<00:02:48.420> saddlebag<00:02:48.960> off<00:02:49.200> we<00:02:49.380> need

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
get the left rear saddlebag off we need

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.880 
get the left rear saddlebag off we need
to<00:02:49.590> open<00:02:49.710> up<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.240> saddlebag<00:02:54.590> open<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.680> lid

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
to open up the saddlebag open the lid

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.010 
to open up the saddlebag open the lid
and<00:02:56.310> on<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:56.790> inside<00:02:57.150> here<00:02:57.510> you<00:02:57.630> have<00:02:57.810> these

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
and on the inside here you have these

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.470 
and on the inside here you have these
these<00:02:58.350> clips<00:02:59.030> just<00:03:00.030> turn<00:03:00.300> them

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
these clips just turn them

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.210 
these clips just turn them
counterclockwise<00:03:00.870> and<00:03:01.970> it<00:03:02.970> will<00:03:03.120> release<00:03:04.220> and

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
counterclockwise and it will release and

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.470 
counterclockwise and it will release and
then<00:03:05.760> there's<00:03:05.970> one<00:03:06.180> on<00:03:06.360> both<00:03:06.960> sides<00:03:07.940> and<00:03:08.940> I'm

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
then there's one on both sides and I'm

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.120 
then there's one on both sides and I'm
trying<00:03:09.720> to<00:03:09.750> hold<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:10.020> camera<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.560> catch<00:03:10.890> this

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
trying to hold the camera and catch this

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.150 
trying to hold the camera and catch this
bag<00:03:11.400> from<00:03:11.670> falling<00:03:12.060> before<00:03:12.270> it<00:03:13.100> anyway<00:03:14.100> you

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
bag from falling before it anyway you

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.380 
bag from falling before it anyway you
just<00:03:14.220> you<00:03:14.730> rotate<00:03:15.030> them<00:03:15.090> counterclockwise

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
just you rotate them counterclockwise

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.300 
just you rotate them counterclockwise
till<00:03:16.170> they<00:03:16.290> release<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:16.800> then<00:03:16.890> you<00:03:16.980> can<00:03:17.130> just

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
till they release and then you can just

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:26.030 
till they release and then you can just
lift<00:03:17.460> this<00:03:17.640> off<00:03:23.960> okay<00:03:24.960> with<00:03:25.260> a<00:03:25.290> saddle<00:03:25.740> bag<00:03:25.860> off

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
lift this off okay with a saddle bag off

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.530 
lift this off okay with a saddle bag off
you<00:03:26.220> can<00:03:26.340> more<00:03:26.490> clearly<00:03:26.670> see<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.150> air<00:03:27.270> valve

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
you can more clearly see the air valve

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.780 
you can more clearly see the air valve
here<00:03:27.780> it's<00:03:28.320> got<00:03:28.470> a<00:03:28.500> cap<00:03:28.770> on<00:03:28.980> it<00:03:29.130> so<00:03:29.340> need<00:03:29.730> to

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
here it's got a cap on it so need to

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.830 
here it's got a cap on it so need to
remove<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.210> cap<00:03:32.000> then<00:03:33.000> take<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.570> hose

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
remove the cap then take the hose

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.670 
remove the cap then take the hose
flexible<00:03:34.830> hose<00:03:35.040> on<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.430> pump<00:03:35.700> and<00:03:36.410> attach<00:03:37.410> it

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
flexible hose on the pump and attach it

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.760 
flexible hose on the pump and attach it
to<00:03:37.710> the<00:03:38.100> air<00:03:38.550> valve<00:03:38.960> just<00:03:39.960> screw<00:03:40.260> it<00:03:40.350> on<00:03:40.470> hand

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
to the air valve just screw it on hand

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.010 
to the air valve just screw it on hand
tighten<00:03:41.160> it

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.440 

now<00:03:45.950> you<00:03:46.010> can<00:03:46.250> see<00:03:46.460> the<00:03:46.610> air<00:03:46.790> gauge<00:03:47.090> on<00:03:47.300> the

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
now you can see the air gauge on the

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.740 
now you can see the air gauge on the
pump<00:03:47.720> is<00:03:47.930> registering<00:03:48.620> about<00:03:48.950> 14<00:03:49.520> psi<00:03:52.750> the

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
pump is registering about 14 psi the

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.180 
pump is registering about 14 psi the
pressure<00:03:53.990> in<00:03:54.260> the<00:03:54.350> rear<00:03:54.500> suspension<00:03:54.650> right

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
pressure in the rear suspension right

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.670 
pressure in the rear suspension right
now<00:03:55.340> is<00:03:55.520> 14<00:03:55.940> psi<00:03:56.450> and<00:03:56.720> given<00:03:57.140> the<00:03:57.230> weight<00:03:57.440> of

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
now is 14 psi and given the weight of

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.710 
now is 14 psi and given the weight of
the<00:03:57.800> rider<00:03:57.950> for<00:03:58.310> this<00:03:58.490> motorcycle<00:03:58.850> I<00:03:59.360> want<00:03:59.600> the

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
the rider for this motorcycle I want the

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.290 
the rider for this motorcycle I want the
air<00:03:59.930> pressure<00:04:00.200> to<00:04:00.320> be<00:04:00.590> between<00:04:00.890> 5<00:04:01.250> psi<00:04:01.760> and<00:04:01.910> 15

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
air pressure to be between 5 psi and 15

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.650 
air pressure to be between 5 psi and 15
psi<00:04:02.750> so<00:04:03.710> I'm<00:04:04.040> going<00:04:04.190> to<00:04:04.250> adjust<00:04:04.460> it<00:04:04.670> to<00:04:04.880> 10<00:04:05.150> psi

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
psi so I'm going to adjust it to 10 psi

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.960

have the correct psi in the system you

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.420 
have the correct psi in the system you
risk<00:07:00.370> bottoming<00:07:01.120> out<00:07:01.270> and<00:07:02.130> you<00:07:03.130> know<00:07:03.220> that's

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:03.430 
risk bottoming out and you know that's

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:04.920 
risk bottoming out and you know that's
that's<00:07:03.670> not<00:07:03.880> a<00:07:03.940> good<00:07:04.030> thing<00:07:04.270> for<00:07:04.420> the<00:07:04.540> bike<00:07:04.720> and

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:04.930 
that's not a good thing for the bike and

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.860

it's not a comfortable way to ride so

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.840 
it's not a comfortable way to ride so
it's<00:07:07.870> important<00:07:08.590> that<00:07:08.620> you<00:07:08.950> put<00:07:09.520> the<00:07:09.640> correct

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:09.850 
it's important that you put the correct

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:12.720 
it's important that you put the correct
psi<00:07:10.390> in<00:07:10.720> these<00:07:11.020> in<00:07:11.890> the<00:07:12.070> rear<00:07:12.220> suspension

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:12.730 
psi in these in the rear suspension

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.000 
psi in these in the rear suspension
