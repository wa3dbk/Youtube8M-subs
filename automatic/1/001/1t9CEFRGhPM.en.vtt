bangs in the opposite direction that I

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.450 
bangs in the opposite direction that I
usually<00:00:26.640> have<00:00:26.880> them<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.650> then<00:00:28.650> I'm<00:00:29.039> going<00:00:29.400> to

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
usually have them and then I'm going to
