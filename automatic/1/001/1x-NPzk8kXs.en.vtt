all<00:00:00.089> right<00:00:00.299> so<00:00:00.510> let's<00:00:00.659> test<00:00:00.870> this<00:00:01.050> invention

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:01.350 
all right so let's test this invention

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:06.829 
all right so let's test this invention
out<00:00:03.560> it<00:00:04.560> works<00:00:04.940> but<00:00:05.940> of<00:00:06.029> course<00:00:06.240> it's<00:00:06.540> not<00:00:06.810> a

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
out it works but of course it's not a

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.810 
out it works but of course it's not a
complete<00:00:07.319> project<00:00:07.890> until<00:00:08.189> we<00:00:08.309> get<00:00:08.400> a<00:00:08.460> subpoena

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
complete project until we get a subpoena

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
complete project until we get a subpoena
from<00:00:08.970> Apple<00:00:16.220> hi<00:00:17.220> there<00:00:17.460> Adam<00:00:17.850> here<00:00:18.060> recently<00:00:18.810> a

from Apple hi there Adam here recently a

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.480 
from Apple hi there Adam here recently a
lot<00:00:19.080> of<00:00:19.170> manufacturers<00:00:19.830> like<00:00:19.980> Samsung<00:00:20.010> and

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
lot of manufacturers like Samsung and

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.130 
lot of manufacturers like Samsung and
Panasonic<00:00:21.180> have<00:00:21.270> been<00:00:21.420> taking<00:00:21.720> an<00:00:21.840> interest

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
Panasonic have been taking an interest

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.240 
Panasonic have been taking an interest
in<00:00:22.350> integrating<00:00:22.619> Android<00:00:23.550> with<00:00:24.180> home<00:00:24.689> devices

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
in integrating Android with home devices

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.439 
in integrating Android with home devices
basically<00:00:26.250> creating<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.789> whole<00:00:26.970> network<00:00:27.180> of

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
basically creating a whole network of

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.870 
basically creating a whole network of
automation<00:00:27.900> so<00:00:28.650> today<00:00:29.130> we're<00:00:29.369> going<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.699> take

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
automation so today we're going to take

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.810 
automation so today we're going to take
a<00:00:29.910> look<00:00:30.240> at<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.630> arduino<00:00:31.289> 80k<00:00:32.009> which<00:00:32.369> enables

mind<00:01:16.229> for<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.070> purposes<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.549> working<00:01:17.939> with

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
mind for the purposes of working with

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.800 
mind for the purposes of working with
the<00:01:18.180> ADK

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
the ADK

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.310 
the ADK
I<00:01:19.229> recommend<00:01:20.009> using<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.460> battery<00:01:20.990> now<00:01:21.990> I'm

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
I recommend using a battery now I'm

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.590 
I recommend using a battery now I'm
gonna<00:01:22.560> hook<00:01:22.740> this<00:01:22.860> thing<00:01:22.920> up<00:01:23.220> really<00:01:23.490> quick

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.929 

so<00:01:27.600> what<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.899> were<00:01:28.020> seeing<00:01:28.259> earlier<00:01:28.560> was<00:01:29.310> this

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
so what you were seeing earlier was this

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.880 
so what you were seeing earlier was this
device<00:01:30.299> hooked<00:01:30.719> up<00:01:30.960> with<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.500> remote<00:01:31.860> control

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
device hooked up with a remote control

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.850 
device hooked up with a remote control
this<00:01:32.850> remote<00:01:33.180> control<00:01:33.299> I've<00:01:33.869> modified<00:01:34.320> inside

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
this remote control I've modified inside

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.380 
this remote control I've modified inside
I<00:01:34.890> have<00:01:35.159> three<00:01:35.399> different<00:01:35.520> relays<00:01:35.939> one<00:01:36.210> for

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
I have three different relays one for

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.419 
I have three different relays one for
each<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.630> these<00:01:36.719> buttons<00:01:36.990> here<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.500> they<00:01:38.219> take

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:38.429 
each of these buttons here and they take

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:41.330 
each of these buttons here and they take
a<00:01:38.460> 5<00:01:38.729> volt<00:01:38.969> input<00:01:39.320> to<00:01:40.320> each<00:01:40.710> one<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:41.009> these<00:01:41.100> pins

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
a 5 volt input to each one of these pins

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.359 
a 5 volt input to each one of these pins
here<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.840> it<00:01:42.840> turns<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.170> into<00:01:43.289> a<00:01:43.439> relay<00:01:43.860> that

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
here and it turns it into a relay that

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.850 
here and it turns it into a relay that
presses<00:01:45.360> these<00:01:45.539> buttons<00:01:45.899> for<00:01:46.140> me<00:01:46.319> basically

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
presses these buttons for me basically

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.649 
presses these buttons for me basically
and<00:01:47.039> the<00:01:47.399> remote<00:01:47.640> control<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.299> actually

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
and the remote control is actually

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.330 
and the remote control is actually
hooked<00:01:48.840> up<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.259> one<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:49.920> these

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
hooked up to one of these

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.169 
hooked up to one of these
it's<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.880> 110<00:01:51.509> volt<00:01:51.719> outlet<00:01:52.850> now<00:01:53.850> for<00:01:54.090> the

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
it's a 110 volt outlet now for the

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.779 
it's a 110 volt outlet now for the
purposes<00:01:54.569> of<00:01:54.630> this<00:01:54.869> video<00:01:55.429> it's<00:01:56.429> going<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.729> be

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
purposes of this video it's going to be

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:58.550 
purposes of this video it's going to be
a<00:01:56.850> lot<00:01:57.030> easier<00:01:57.060> for<00:01:57.450> me<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.750> demonstrate<00:01:57.929> with

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
a lot easier for me to demonstrate with

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.660 
a lot easier for me to demonstrate with
some<00:01:59.399> LEDs<00:01:59.819> rather<00:02:00.330> than<00:02:00.599> trying<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.409> use

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
some LEDs rather than trying to use

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.539 
some LEDs rather than trying to use
full-blown<00:02:02.670> 110<00:02:03.330> volt<00:02:03.569> outlets<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.709> we're

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
full-blown 110 volt outlets so we're

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:11.770 
full-blown 110 volt outlets so we're
going<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.819> get<00:02:05.880> started<00:02:06.090> on<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.390> firmware

want<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.180> do<00:02:36.329> is<00:02:36.569> to<00:02:37.459> go<00:02:38.459> into<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:39.209> trunk

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
want to do is to go into the trunk

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.960 
want to do is to go into the trunk
folder<00:02:39.810> that<00:02:39.959> you<00:02:40.079> download<00:02:40.440> from<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:41.280> source

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
folder that you download from the source

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.710 
folder that you download from the source
checkout<00:02:43.100> navigate<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.310> arduino<00:02:44.910> and<00:02:45.420> you'll

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
checkout navigate to arduino and you'll

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.930 
checkout navigate to arduino and you'll
find<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.019> libraries<00:02:46.530> folder<00:02:46.709> in<00:02:47.010> there<00:02:47.190> so

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
find the libraries folder in there so

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.460 
find the libraries folder in there so
you<00:02:48.000> go<00:02:48.180> into<00:02:48.329> this<00:02:48.450> folder<00:02:48.660> and<00:02:49.079> you<00:02:49.170> replace

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
you go into this folder and you replace

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.110 
you go into this folder and you replace
the<00:02:49.620> libraries<00:02:50.160> for<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.430> libraries

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
the libraries for the libraries

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.720 
the libraries for the libraries
the<00:02:51.300> XDA<00:02:51.750> ADK<00:02:52.379> project<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.160> then<00:02:53.550> you'll<00:02:53.700> be

ready to launch the art and we know

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.369 
ready to launch the art and we know
application<00:02:56.420> so<00:02:57.420> next<00:02:57.690> you'll<00:02:57.810> want<00:02:57.840> to<00:02:58.080> open

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
application so next you'll want to open

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:01.160 
application so next you'll want to open
up<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.560> sketch<00:02:58.830> provided<00:02:59.340> in<00:02:59.519> the<00:02:59.760> XDA<00:03:00.569> ATK

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
up the sketch provided in the XDA ATK

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.500 
up the sketch provided in the XDA ATK
repository<00:03:02.069> and<00:03:02.670> you<00:03:02.790> can<00:03:02.940> find<00:03:03.150> that<00:03:03.269> in<00:03:03.480> the

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
repository and you can find that in the

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:10.369 
repository and you can find that in the
trunk<00:03:03.870> slash<00:03:04.800> arduino<00:03:05.550> /<00:03:06.530> XDA<00:03:07.530> ATK<00:03:09.260> open<00:03:10.260> that

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
trunk slash arduino / XDA ATK open that

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.309 
trunk slash arduino / XDA ATK open that
up<00:03:10.560> and<00:03:11.010> here's<00:03:11.519> what<00:03:11.870> so<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:12.959> very<00:03:13.140> first

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
up and here's what so the very first

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.839 
up and here's what so the very first
thing<00:03:13.470> that<00:03:13.560> happens<00:03:13.980> is<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.430> Android

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
thing that happens is the Android

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.660 
thing that happens is the Android
accessory<00:03:15.360> is<00:03:15.480> to<00:03:15.599> find<00:03:15.870> right<00:03:16.080> here<00:03:16.319> and<00:03:17.069> then

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
accessory is to find right here and then

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.600 
accessory is to find right here and then
it<00:03:17.790> jumps<00:03:18.060> over<00:03:18.150> to<00:03:18.299> setup<00:03:19.040> setup<00:03:20.040> then

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
it jumps over to setup setup then

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.270 
it jumps over to setup setup then
initiates<00:03:21.239> a<00:03:21.360> serial<00:03:21.750> connection<00:03:21.980> and<00:03:22.980> does

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
initiates a serial connection and does

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.819 
initiates a serial connection and does
the<00:03:23.459> init<00:03:23.790> leds<00:03:24.360> function<00:03:24.900> which<00:03:25.110> then<00:03:25.380> turns

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
the init leds function which then turns

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:30.140 
the init leds function which then turns
all<00:03:26.130> of<00:03:26.280> these<00:03:26.430> pins<00:03:27.060> here<00:03:27.319> into<00:03:28.459> outputs<00:03:29.459> and

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
all of these pins here into outputs and

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.720 
all of these pins here into outputs and
turns<00:03:30.569> upon<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:30.989> home<00:03:31.140> then<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.190> accessory

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
turns upon the home then the accessory

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.319 
turns upon the home then the accessory
this<00:03:33.269> right<00:03:33.720> here<00:03:33.930> is<00:03:34.410> then<00:03:35.280> powered<00:03:35.670> on<00:03:35.819> so

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
this right here is then powered on so

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.210 
this right here is then powered on so
this<00:03:36.480> becomes<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:36.959> USB<00:03:37.349> device<00:03:37.470> at<00:03:37.950> this

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
this becomes the USB device at this

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.110 
this becomes the USB device at this
point<00:03:38.519> right<00:03:38.670> here

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
point right here

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.960 
point right here
next<00:03:39.540> up<00:03:39.690> the<00:03:40.260> loop<00:03:40.470> is<00:03:40.680> executed<00:03:40.950> so<00:03:41.640> what

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
next up the loop is executed so what

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.050 
next up the loop is executed so what
Luke<00:03:42.180> does<00:03:42.450> is<00:03:42.750> it<00:03:42.989> defines<00:03:43.200> a<00:03:44.060> three-part

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
Luke does is it defines a three-part

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.600 
Luke does is it defines a three-part
array<00:03:45.480> and<00:03:45.750> then<00:03:46.470> if<00:03:46.799> the<00:03:46.980> accessory<00:03:47.489> is

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
array and then if the accessory is

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.080 
array and then if the accessory is
connected<00:03:47.790> it<00:03:48.720> reads<00:03:49.250> the<00:03:50.250> message<00:03:50.459> from<00:03:50.940> the

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
connected it reads the message from the

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.660 
connected it reads the message from the
accessory<00:03:51.599> be<00:03:51.959> that<00:03:52.170> 0<00:03:52.470> or<00:03:52.769> it's<00:03:53.099> actually<00:03:53.579> is

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
accessory be that 0 or it's actually is

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.390 
accessory be that 0 or it's actually is
message<00:03:54.150> it'll<00:03:54.360> be<00:03:54.569> longer<00:03:54.900> than<00:03:55.139> 0<00:03:55.500> and<00:03:55.799> it

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
message it'll be longer than 0 and it

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.610 
message it'll be longer than 0 and it
puts<00:03:56.609> that<00:03:56.670> into<00:03:56.910> the<00:03:57.329> message<00:03:57.630> variable<00:03:57.959> and

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
puts that into the message variable and

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.470 
puts that into the message variable and
if<00:03:58.829> the<00:03:58.980> length<00:03:59.190> is<00:03:59.430> greater<00:03:59.730> than<00:03:59.910> 0<00:04:00.209> it'll

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
if the length is greater than 0 it'll

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.080 
if the length is greater than 0 it'll
act<00:04:00.750> upon<00:04:01.049> it<00:04:01.200> now<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.799> message<00:04:02.250> if<00:04:02.700> first

3 then it will command an led to the
value<00:04:11.530> specified<00:04:12.010> so<00:04:12.849> basically<00:04:13.180> what

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
value specified so basically what

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.360 
value specified so basically what
happens<00:04:13.720> is<00:04:13.840> the<00:04:14.349> first<00:04:14.530> part<00:04:14.830> says<00:04:15.040> I'm<00:04:15.220> going

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
happens is the first part says I'm going

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.640 
happens is the first part says I'm going
to<00:04:15.489> turn<00:04:15.670> on<00:04:15.730> an<00:04:15.970> LED<00:04:16.120> the<00:04:16.900> second<00:04:17.260> part<00:04:17.470> then

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
to turn on an LED the second part then

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.580 
to turn on an LED the second part then
says<00:04:18.040> which<00:04:18.790> LED<00:04:19.239> and<00:04:19.510> the<00:04:19.870> third<00:04:20.049> part<00:04:20.350> says

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
says which LED and the third part says

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.800 
says which LED and the third part says
high<00:04:21.070> or<00:04:21.340> low<00:04:21.519> and<00:04:21.880> you<00:04:22.090> can<00:04:22.210> see<00:04:22.330> that<00:04:22.510> all

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.540 
right here most of this the serial dot
print<00:04:25.600> that's<00:04:25.900> just<00:04:26.139> for<00:04:26.290> debug<00:04:26.620> let's<00:04:27.400> take<00:04:27.520> a

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
print that's just for debug let's take a

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.000 
print that's just for debug let's take a
look<00:04:27.790> at<00:04:27.850> the<00:04:27.940> serial<00:04:28.270> monitor<00:04:28.889> so<00:04:29.889> now

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
look at the serial monitor so now

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.590 
look at the serial monitor so now
because<00:04:30.190> I<00:04:30.490> have<00:04:30.580> plugged<00:04:30.880> in<00:04:31.000> battery<00:04:31.419> to

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
because I have plugged in battery to

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.810 
because I have plugged in battery to
this<00:04:31.720> you<00:04:32.410> can<00:04:32.560> see<00:04:32.770> when<00:04:33.010> the<00:04:33.160> LED<00:04:33.760> is

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
this you can see when the LED is

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.030 
this you can see when the LED is
initialized<00:04:34.389> it<00:04:34.660> turns<00:04:35.020> them<00:04:35.200> all<00:04:35.290> on<00:04:35.530> and<00:04:35.770> now

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
initialized it turns them all on and now

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.770 
initialized it turns them all on and now
let's<00:04:36.280> hook<00:04:36.400> up<00:04:36.490> the<00:04:36.610> debug<00:04:36.910> alright<00:04:37.450> so<00:04:37.630> we

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
let's hook up the debug alright so we

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
let's hook up the debug alright so we
want<00:04:37.870> to<00:04:37.990> see<00:04:38.110> what<00:04:38.229> happens<00:04:38.470> when<00:04:38.590> this<00:04:38.740> thing

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
want to see what happens when this thing

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.159 
want to see what happens when this thing
gets<00:04:39.040> initialized<00:04:39.419> so<00:04:40.419> we're<00:04:40.660> going<00:04:40.810> to<00:04:40.900> start

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
gets initialized so we're going to start

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.740 
gets initialized so we're going to start
the<00:04:41.290> serial<00:04:41.680> monitor<00:04:41.800> now<00:04:42.240> and<00:04:43.240> as<00:04:43.540> you<00:04:43.660> can

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
the serial monitor now and as you can

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.510 
the serial monitor now and as you can
see<00:04:43.810> it<00:04:44.080> says<00:04:44.260> starting<00:04:44.889> and<00:04:45.250> then<00:04:45.400> it

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
see it says starting and then it

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.690 
see it says starting and then it
initializes<00:04:45.970> each<00:04:46.630> one<00:04:46.870> of<00:04:46.960> the<00:04:47.020> pins<00:04:47.430> as<00:04:48.430> it

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
initializes each one of the pins as it

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.330 
initializes each one of the pins as it
goes<00:04:48.820> on<00:04:49.000> down<00:04:49.210> and<00:04:49.960> these<00:04:50.590> are<00:04:50.770> all<00:04:50.919> the<00:04:51.130> pins

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
goes on down and these are all the pins

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.800 
goes on down and these are all the pins
that<00:04:51.700> are<00:04:52.000> located<00:04:52.419> in<00:04:53.169> the<00:04:54.030> led<00:04:55.030> these

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
that are located in the led these

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.740 
that are located in the led these
messages<00:04:56.260> here<00:04:56.590> initializing<00:04:57.190> pin<00:04:57.750> whatever

all right so now notice what happens
when<00:05:20.440> I<00:05:20.470> plug<00:05:20.680> this<00:05:20.860> out<00:05:22.890> it<00:05:23.890> automatically

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
when I plug this out it automatically

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.220 
when I plug this out it automatically
launches<00:05:24.670> an<00:05:25.030> application<00:05:25.660> that's<00:05:25.810> the<00:05:25.990> sign

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:26.230 
launches an application that's the sign

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.390 
launches an application that's the sign
for<00:05:27.040> this<00:05:27.870> accessory<00:05:28.870> right<00:05:29.290> here<00:05:29.560> so<00:05:30.220> let's

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
for this accessory right here so let's

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.980 
for this accessory right here so let's
go<00:05:30.520> back<00:05:30.670> to<00:05:30.790> our<00:05:30.820> debugging<00:05:31.240> connection<00:05:31.750> and

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
go back to our debugging connection and

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.380 
go back to our debugging connection and
I'm<00:05:32.170> going<00:05:32.500> to<00:05:32.530> turn<00:05:32.800> on<00:05:33.040> and<00:05:33.310> off<00:05:33.370> the<00:05:33.700> various

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:34.390 
I'm going to turn on and off the various

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.570 
I'm going to turn on and off the various
LEDs<00:05:34.840> and<00:05:35.110> watch<00:05:35.350> what<00:05:35.560> happens<00:05:35.860> here<00:05:35.920> inside

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
LEDs and watch what happens here inside

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.710 
LEDs and watch what happens here inside
of<00:05:36.760> this<00:05:36.910> debug<00:05:37.270> window<00:05:38.490> notice<00:05:39.490> LED<00:05:40.090> 0<00:05:40.360> that's

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
of this debug window notice LED 0 that's

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.730 
of this debug window notice LED 0 that's
the<00:05:40.870> first<00:05:41.080> one<00:05:41.290> is<00:05:41.680> commanded<00:05:42.430> to<00:05:42.460> a<00:05:42.640> value<00:05:43.330> of

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
the first one is commanded to a value of

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.290 
the first one is commanded to a value of
what<00:05:44.740> I'm<00:05:44.830> gonna<00:05:44.920> do<00:05:45.160> now<00:05:45.310> is<00:05:45.340> I'll<00:05:45.790> turn<00:05:46.000> all

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
what I'm gonna do now is I'll turn all

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.690 
what I'm gonna do now is I'll turn all
of<00:05:46.480> these<00:05:46.630> on<00:05:46.840> and<00:05:47.260> you'll<00:05:48.010> notice<00:05:48.220> that<00:05:48.340> some

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:48.700 
of these on and you'll notice that some

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.240 
of these on and you'll notice that some
of<00:05:48.880> them<00:05:49.120> don't<00:05:49.420> actually<00:05:49.720> turn<00:05:50.470> on<00:05:50.500> these

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
of them don't actually turn on these

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.730 
of them don't actually turn on these
ones<00:05:51.490> right<00:05:51.670> here<00:05:52.170> don't<00:05:53.170> actually<00:05:53.440> affect

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 
ones right here don't actually affect

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.670 
ones right here don't actually affect
anything<00:05:54.370> at<00:05:54.490> all<00:05:54.610> and<00:05:55.270> the<00:05:55.960> reason<00:05:56.320> for<00:05:56.350> that

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
anything at all and the reason for that

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.830 
anything at all and the reason for that
is<00:05:57.010> because<00:05:57.250> some<00:05:57.970> of<00:05:58.000> these<00:05:58.150> LEDs<00:05:58.630> are

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 
is because some of these LEDs are

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.930 
is because some of these LEDs are
actually<00:05:59.260> reserved<00:05:59.650> pins<00:06:00.040> on<00:06:00.400> the<00:06:00.670> Arduino

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
actually reserved pins on the Arduino

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.380 
actually reserved pins on the Arduino
device<00:06:01.680> for<00:06:02.680> communication<00:06:03.010> with<00:06:03.880> USB<00:06:04.210> and
