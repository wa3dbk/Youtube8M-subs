00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:12.389 
like at all really is what all the

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:14.210 
like at all really is what all the
design<00:03:12.750> changes<00:03:13.139> they've<00:03:13.290> done<00:03:13.470> with<00:03:13.680> 4.4

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
design changes they've done with 4.4

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.009 
design changes they've done with 4.4
kitkat<00:03:14.609> this<00:03:15.239> would<00:03:15.419> have<00:03:15.510> been<00:03:15.540> good<00:03:15.750> if<00:03:15.810> it

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
kitkat this would have been good if it

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.629 
kitkat this would have been good if it
was<00:03:16.109> after<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.650> gingerbread<00:03:17.040> update<00:03:17.189> but<00:03:17.519> I

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639 
was after the gingerbread update but I

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:20.240 
was after the gingerbread update but I
think<00:03:17.939> Ice<00:03:18.030> Cream<00:03:18.239> Sandwich<00:03:18.290> design<00:03:19.290> on<00:03:19.560> the

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
think Ice Cream Sandwich design on the

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.800 
think Ice Cream Sandwich design on the
android<00:03:20.699> user<00:03:20.849> interface<00:03:21.209> it's<00:03:21.389> far<00:03:21.599> more

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
android user interface it's far more

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.469 
android user interface it's far more
superior<00:03:22.500> and<00:03:22.889> better<00:03:23.129> in<00:03:23.430> pretty<00:03:24.120> much<00:03:24.180> every

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:24.479 
superior and better in pretty much every

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:27.439 
superior and better in pretty much every
way<00:03:24.629> then<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.019> KitKat<00:03:25.349> version<00:03:25.709> so<00:03:26.370> as<00:03:27.299> you

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:27.449 
way then the KitKat version so as you

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:29.449 
way then the KitKat version so as you
saw<00:03:27.599> there's<00:03:27.989> no<00:03:28.109> widgets<00:03:28.319> tab<00:03:28.680> unfortunately

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
saw there's no widgets tab unfortunately

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.490 
saw there's no widgets tab unfortunately
so<00:03:29.790> if<00:03:30.599> you<00:03:30.750> can't<00:03:30.930> do<00:03:31.049> the<00:03:31.079> wages<00:03:31.319> than<00:03:31.409> you

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
so if you can't do the wages than you

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.599 
so if you can't do the wages than you
have<00:03:31.590> to<00:03:31.650> find<00:03:31.769> them<00:03:31.919> this<00:03:32.010> other<00:03:32.220> way<00:03:32.430> which

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
have to find them this other way which

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.420 
have to find them this other way which
is<00:03:32.639> tap<00:03:33.000> and<00:03:33.180> hold<00:03:33.299> you<00:03:34.199> see<00:03:34.650> widgets<00:03:35.250> all

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
is tap and hold you see widgets all

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.960 
is tap and hold you see widgets all
right<00:03:35.639> here<00:03:35.849> and<00:03:36.319> then<00:03:37.519> there<00:03:38.519> you<00:03:38.579> go<00:03:38.609> near

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
right here and then there you go near

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.719 
right here and then there you go near
your<00:03:39.060> widget<00:03:39.680> it<00:03:40.680> was<00:03:40.859> much<00:03:41.069> more<00:03:41.220> easier<00:03:41.579> to

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:41.729 
your widget it was much more easier to

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:43.460 
your widget it was much more easier to
access<00:03:41.909> them<00:03:42.269> from<00:03:42.299> the<00:03:42.599> app<00:03:42.720> drawer<00:03:43.019> whereas

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
access them from the app drawer whereas

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.960 
access them from the app drawer whereas
now<00:03:43.590> you<00:03:43.650> have<00:03:43.799> to<00:03:43.919> go<00:03:44.159> a<00:03:44.190> completely<00:03:44.519> separate

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
now you have to go a completely separate

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.059 
now you have to go a completely separate
route<00:03:45.209> I<00:03:45.449> really<00:03:46.139> don't<00:03:46.349> like<00:03:46.409> that<00:03:46.560> change

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
route I really don't like that change

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.399 
route I really don't like that change
but<00:03:47.400> there<00:03:47.790> you<00:03:47.879> go<00:03:47.909> and<00:03:48.269> they<00:03:48.720> can<00:03:48.840> also<00:03:48.930> do

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:49.409 
but there you go and they can also do

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:51.259 
but there you go and they can also do

27 like this or the saddle book on
tablets<00:04:24.060> and<00:04:24.300> again<00:04:25.229> which<00:04:25.770> is<00:04:25.800> unfortunately

tablets and again which is unfortunately
moved<00:04:26.669> again<00:04:26.969> after<00:04:27.180> Cap'n

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
moved again after Cap'n

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.690 
moved again after Cap'n
old<00:04:27.780> tap<00:04:28.410> into<00:04:28.590> widgets<00:04:28.980> and<00:04:29.160> here<00:04:29.550> they<00:04:29.670> are

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
old tap into widgets and here they are

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.190 
old tap into widgets and here they are
very<00:04:30.270> quick<00:04:30.450> to<00:04:30.480> get<00:04:30.630> to<00:04:30.720> the<00:04:30.780> widgets<00:04:31.080> by

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
very quick to get to the widgets by

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.570 
very quick to get to the widgets by
think<00:04:31.380> is<00:04:31.470> much<00:04:31.650> quicker<00:04:31.890> and<00:04:32.070> much<00:04:32.310> more

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
think is much quicker and much more

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.090 
think is much quicker and much more
efficient<00:04:33.090> and<00:04:33.270> nicer<00:04:33.930> to<00:04:34.050> look<00:04:34.080> at<00:04:34.380> when<00:04:35.070> they

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
efficient and nicer to look at when they

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.250 
efficient and nicer to look at when they
were<00:04:35.250> in<00:04:35.370> the<00:04:35.490> app<00:04:35.610> drawer<00:04:35.940> and<00:04:36.150> yes<00:04:36.960> if<00:04:37.110> I<00:04:37.200> do

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
were in the app drawer and yes if I do

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.890 
were in the app drawer and yes if I do
