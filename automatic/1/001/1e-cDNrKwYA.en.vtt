kind of a semi casual look because it's

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.880

not<00:02:34.800> fully<00:02:35.280> all<00:02:35.550> out<00:02:35.880> but<00:02:36.360> it's<00:02:36.510> actually<00:02:36.860> flat

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.650 

I'm<00:02:40.890> going<00:02:41.160> to<00:02:41.250> use<00:02:41.430> my<00:02:41.459> liquid<00:02:42.240> eyeliner

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
I'm going to use my liquid eyeliner

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.470 
I'm going to use my liquid eyeliner
again<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.380> this<00:02:44.220> one<00:02:44.430> starts<00:02:44.790> right<00:02:45.180> at<00:02:45.360> the

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
again and this one starts right at the

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.180 
again and this one starts right at the
corner<00:02:45.840> not<00:02:46.290> even<00:02:46.440> in<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.650> middle<00:02:46.830> starts

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
corner not even in the middle starts

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.140 
corner not even in the middle starts
right<00:02:47.370> in<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:47.550> corner<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:48.120> you

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
right in the corner and you

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.090 
right in the corner and you
progressively<00:02:48.840> go<00:02:49.080> out<00:02:49.290> with<00:02:49.530> a<00:02:49.560> little<00:02:49.830> wing

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
progressively go out with a little wing

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.460 
progressively go out with a little wing
but<00:02:50.790> it's<00:02:50.910> going<00:02:51.030> to<00:02:51.120> be<00:02:51.240> in<00:02:51.330> a<00:02:51.390> v-shape<00:02:51.720> again

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
but it's going to be in a v-shape again

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.040 
but it's going to be in a v-shape again
so<00:02:53.130> it<00:02:53.220> creates<00:02:53.610> that<00:02:53.880> really<00:02:54.330> casual<00:02:54.840> but

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
so it creates that really casual but

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.630 
so it creates that really casual but
you're<00:02:55.170> still<00:02:55.380> wearing<00:02:55.590> makeup<00:02:55.950> look<00:02:56.340> and

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
you're still wearing makeup look and

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.150 
you're still wearing makeup look and
don't<00:02:57.390> forget<00:02:57.570> you<00:02:58.290> don't<00:02:58.470> have<00:02:58.680> to<00:02:58.920> use<00:02:59.130> a

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
don't forget you don't have to use a

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.160 
don't forget you don't have to use a
liquid<00:02:59.850> eyeliner<00:03:00.390> whatever<00:03:00.870> you<00:03:01.019> feel
