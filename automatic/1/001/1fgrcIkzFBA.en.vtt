with<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.299> thought<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:58.079> one<00:01:58.290> was<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.469> little

with you I thought this one was a little

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.859 
with you I thought this one was a little
bit<00:01:58.799> funnier<00:01:59.310> but<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.820> know<00:01:59.939> that's<00:02:00.240> like<00:02:00.570> you

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
bit funnier but you know that's like you

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.980 
bit funnier but you know that's like you
know<00:02:01.460> American<00:02:02.460> sense<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:03.000> humor<00:02:03.390> but<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:03.659> think

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
know American sense of humor but I think

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.420 
know American sense of humor but I think
like<00:02:04.110> I<00:02:04.259> said<00:02:04.530> man<00:02:04.799> when<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.009> talk<00:02:05.189> about

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
do with these ads so not saying that

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.870 
do with these ads so not saying that
Ford<00:02:32.880> condones<00:02:33.480> these<00:02:33.870> ads<00:02:34.230> in<00:02:34.500> any<00:02:34.800> way<00:02:35.070> but

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
Ford condones these ads in any way but

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.960 
Ford condones these ads in any way but
uh<00:02:35.910> you<00:02:36.510> know<00:02:36.660> it's<00:02:37.050> just<00:02:37.320> sad<00:02:38.070> when<00:02:38.520> something

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
uh you know it's just sad when something

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.000 
uh you know it's just sad when something
like<00:02:39.120> this<00:02:39.180> actually<00:02:39.660> makes<00:02:40.440> it<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.860> the

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
like this actually makes it to the

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.270 
like this actually makes it to the
internet<00:02:41.520> now<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.060> know<00:02:42.480> I<00:02:42.780> agree<00:02:43.380> that<00:02:43.740> just

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
internet now you know I agree that just

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.979 
internet now you know I agree that just
okay<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:44.670> be<00:02:44.940> creative<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:45.540> come<00:02:45.630> up<00:02:45.810> with

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
okay to be creative and come up with

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.960 
okay to be creative and come up with
these<00:02:46.200> concepts<00:02:46.920> but<00:02:47.459> I<00:02:47.520> think<00:02:47.790> it<00:02:47.880> should

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
these concepts but I think it should

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.610 
these concepts but I think it should
have<00:02:48.120> stayed<00:02:48.360> in<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.570> boardroom<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.410> don't

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
have stayed in the boardroom I don't

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.850 
have stayed in the boardroom I don't
think<00:02:49.860> that<00:02:50.130> these<00:02:50.760> ads<00:02:51.620> should<00:02:52.620> have<00:02:52.709> been

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
think that these ads should have been

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.860 
think that these ads should have been
able<00:02:53.130> to<00:02:53.310> hit<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.790> internet<00:02:54.209> like<00:02:54.390> they<00:02:54.600> did

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
able to hit the internet like they did

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.510 
able to hit the internet like they did
but<00:02:55.500> you<00:02:55.620> know<00:02:55.650> saying<00:02:55.950> that's<00:02:56.100> just<00:02:56.190> my

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
but you know saying that's just my

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.710
