00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.690
 I guess 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.040
 a part of the medicinal properties 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:11.800
 of the call you study here in the 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.950
 institute of natural sciences in the 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.779
 country we have 54 species of yam and this one 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.510
 more is here working on the part 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:22.090
 taxonomic and systematic we are 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.910
 identifying by describing the species 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:28.330
 what we have here and trying to understand 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.130
 the relationships they have between 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.859
 edible species in the species 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.750
 medicinal and so far the results 

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:37.780
 they indicate that they form lineages 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.780
 different we have the species that 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.149
 are of nutritional value belong to a 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.520
 lineage in the species that have value 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.739
 medicinal belong to other subjects 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.579
 some call the native call 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:54.010
 sarsaparilla miami is the common name 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.110
 more known more associated with the name 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.649
 scum scientist that is the genus 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.360
 botanist the word sarsaparilla is 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.910
 use here 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:07.000
 in the central region of colombia also 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:10.120
 to refer to the tubers 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.450
 of the species from these areas online 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.850
 the native tubers to flow but 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.540
 in the same word sarsaparilla is 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:22.090
 can also use for other families 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.800
 botanical plural I explain myself the 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.830
 chemical compounds that the flame has 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:30.310
 concentrate and san jorge ' ni nash that are 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.260
 chemicals that are presented 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.280
 naturally in the tubers that 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:38.830
 they have a structure chemically 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.620
 similar to steroids 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.720
 and that means it's true that yes 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.000
 they can have different activities 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.730
 biological steroids are 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.810
 involved in many processes 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:55.509
 biological in the human body and yes 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.119
 a variety of possible actions 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.520
 that they can have on the body and you have to 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.229
 investigate them with the camera of diego 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.930
 wheel and formed to agency 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.409
 news from the national university 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.409
