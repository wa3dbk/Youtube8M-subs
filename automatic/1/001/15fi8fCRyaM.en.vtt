 at 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.690
 the path to the perfect landing page 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.850
 do you need 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.950
 and scored st and you made your first 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.469
 landing page version 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.990
 think that she is perfectly naive very 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:19.600
 rarely conversion masterpieces are created with 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.189
 first time if the page worked 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.199
 the whole team then surely 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.509
 there was a lot of controversy 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:26.050
 what text to write what picture 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:28.000
 to insert 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.640
 where better to place calls to action 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.860
 what color button to choose and so on 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.290
 at the design stage understand what 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.190
 lead to sales growth difficult and arguing 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.360
 useless all ideas need to be tested 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.160
 the corporation in these cases is ordered 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.440
 expensive and pick up services 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.570
 they can afford it but you 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.490
 if you run a medium or small business 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.160
 in the network can such a budget and not 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.650
 appear in this video we will meet 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.540
 two free tools which 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.070
 allow for a detailed analysis 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.450
 pages and significantly improve 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.400
 website conversion 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.070
 the first tool with which you

 get acquainted with web viser in vizar this 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.450
 unique now free service for 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.700
 research and take away site 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.910
 studying the behavior of visitors and 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.220
 increase the conversion we analyze the situation you 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.470
 site owner and thanks to the standard 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.930
 google analytics statistics tool 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.600
 Yandex metrics counters know what to 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.720
 your site comes in for example 100 people from 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.909
 10 of them do the order and 90 do not seem to 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.400
 useful information but with all this 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.540
 I would like to know why 90 did not do as well 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.460
 10 done 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.440
 and the web visar is just that tool 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.390
 which helps determine what 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.610
 prevented your site visitors 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.140
 perform target action possible 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.360
 visitors are facing some kind of 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.190
 problem with some kind of obstacle not 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.620
 noticed an important item in the menu 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.140
 absolutely the simplest case did not notice 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.330
 buy button it is framed so do n't 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.530
 it is clear that this button is not clear what 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.500
 you need to press it 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.450
 web visor records and provides for 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.610
 analysis detailed information about 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.250
 visitor actions while working with 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.440
 site in the form of a live video you see 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.990
 how the user made mouse movements 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.269
 clicks keystrokes and form filling 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.830
 switch between windows transitions by 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.930
 pages and more 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.909
 earlier to hold a similar 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.620
 the experiment had to sit next to 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:20.440
 man and look for his 10 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.420
 them now in blizzard is doing it for you 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.250

 user right up to fill out the forms 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.750
 allowing you to conduct the remote and 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:30.580
 take testing only minus 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.769
 conclusions you have to do yourself 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.079
 watching user behavior on 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.450
 page you will easily understand where you were 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:39.370
 right and where were you wrong this will allow you 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.040
 correct your mistakes and significantly 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.079
 increase conversion except video 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.940
 action in bizarre there are others 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.010
 useful report types that are true 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.079
 more suitable for analyzing whole sites 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.480
 than for individual landing pages 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:54.910
 heat map of scrolling card clicks and 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.920
 card attention heat map of clicks 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.590
 allows you to see which areas of the page 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.750
 users click on a scrolling map 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.790
 you see what part of the text read 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.680
 on the map attention you see how 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.560
 distributed user attention to 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.690
 page analyzing these cards you can 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.730
 judge whether the user behaves so 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.530
 as planned with web visor 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.000
 met the next tool 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.329
 which you should adopt 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.609
 google website optimizer this service 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:23.530
 the tool makes it easy to test 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.790
 different variations of the same 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.669
 landing page 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.769
 simple classic example you trade 

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:32.260
 mountain bikes and land 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:34.030
 traffic to a special page designer 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.560
 on the layout has developed for you two versions 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.609
 design with different locations 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.829
 items 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:40.750
 different photos of bikes and people 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:43.269
 various headers benefits 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.549
 You do not know which option to choose what 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.560
 do in this case create several 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:49.599
 page options and test on 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.400
 which version of the page visitors will be 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:53.470
 perform the target action more often 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.510
 You can make such a test using 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.910
 google website optimizer like this 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.280
 works you have 2 options page 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.410
 and you don't know which option is better you 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.660
 place a special code on both 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.150
 page options and direct the flow 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.489
 visitors to the site further this stream 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.220
 automatically divided into 2 groups of one 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.319
 group show the page and the other would 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.539
 In automatic mode, the program measures 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.579
 conversion of each page for example on 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:20.320
 which page more often presses a button 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.840
 buy and give you an objective answer 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.030
 which version of the page is better that 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.680
 test it depends on which one 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.110
 target action must do 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.009
 user for example if your task 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.629
 increase the number of subscriptions 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:34.369
 you will test the shape length 

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:36.319
 social fields 

00:04:34.369 --> 00:04:37.159
 proofs of the size and color of the button 

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:38.990
 subscribe 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:41.389
 other items you can 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.490
 test calls to action headline 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:45.529
 and product description the length of the forms and 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.449
 number of fields element layout 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:50.089
 and style prices and discounts 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:52.430
 product pictures and images quantity 

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:53.899
 text on the page who knows suddenly 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.879
 discount increase sales 

00:04:53.899 --> 00:04:58.009
 and suddenly orders will be more with more 

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:59.930
 high price and suddenly special conditions 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:02.210
 Delivery is one of the most important 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.520
 conditions for your customers and suddenly 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.559
 any such suddenly you can 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.689
 test with google website 

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:10.759
 optimizer create various options 

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:13.460
 pages direct traffic to them and 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:15.409
 see which page wins all 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.729
 technical aspects of google website 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:19.219
 optimizer takes care of 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:20.899
 famous example earlier twitter to 

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:23.300
 encourage you to write something 

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:25.399
 placed in the window the next call that you 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.770
 now doing this led to the fact that 

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:29.539
 the quality of the flowers was very low people 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.539
 just wrote that they didn't go 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:33.229
 the store bought then they changed the call 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:35.330
 acting on 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:37.300
 what happens after that 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.620
 the quality of responses has increased significantly 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.689
 definitely on your page 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.819
 There are such elements that have 

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:45.020
 significant influence on decision making 

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:47.659
 about committing the target action 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.610
 visitors are very often small 

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:51.349
 rephrasing key benefits 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.909
 can lead to significant growth 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:53.930
 of sales 

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:56.269
 test all the ideas that you have 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.069
 eat and find out what works and what doesn't and 

00:05:56.269 --> 00:06:00.229
 so the path to the perfect page 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:02.269
 touchdown lies through testing 

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:04.639
 research behavior of visitors 

00:06:02.269 --> 00:06:05.180
 using tied in and google website 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:06.709
 optimizer 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.050
 you have to understand what's stopping people 

00:06:06.709 --> 00:06:10.999
 perform the target action it will allow 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.189
 you correct mistakes and increase 

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:15.379
 conversion after you do 

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:16.909
 all these actions you get perfect 

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:18.620
 landing page that is 

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:19.309
 close to ideal page 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.709
 landings 

00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:23.779
 left to fill it with visitors and 

00:06:21.709 --> 00:06:26.149
 watch them turn into 

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:28.219
 buyers you sold once you 

00:06:26.149 --> 00:06:30.709
 made great efforts to attract 

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:32.930
 and convert visitor how to sell 

00:06:30.709 --> 00:06:35.209
 him again how to keep him as 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:38.889
 turn into a customer for life about 

00:06:35.209 --> 00:06:38.889
 This will be discussed in the next video.
