00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
right now I put a new document making

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.390 
right now I put a new document making
about<00:00:24.019> 100<00:00:25.019> pixels<00:00:25.380> by<00:00:25.710> 100<00:00:26.279> it's<00:00:26.970> okay<00:00:28.400> zoom

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
about 100 pixels by 100 it's okay zoom

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.740 
about 100 pixels by 100 it's okay zoom
in<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.640> little<00:00:29.760> bit<00:00:29.939> so<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.300> can<00:00:30.330> actually<00:00:30.539> see

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
in a little bit so you can actually see

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.360 
in a little bit so you can actually see
it<00:00:31.640> then<00:00:32.640> grab<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.180> pencil<00:00:33.809> tool<00:00:34.130> and<00:00:35.130> just

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
it then grab the pencil tool and just

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.170 
it then grab the pencil tool and just
with<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.610> normal<00:00:39.600> brush<00:00:39.780> just<00:00:40.050> draw<00:00:40.530> some

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
with the normal brush just draw some

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.450

wavy<00:00:42.180> lines<00:00:43.489> just<00:00:44.489> Edison<00:00:45.210> like<00:00:45.360> this<00:00:45.539> is<00:00:45.690> okay

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
wavy lines just Edison like this is okay

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.130 
wavy lines just Edison like this is okay
it<00:00:47.460> all<00:00:47.610> seems<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.969> work<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.270> same<00:00:51.140> alright

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140

go<00:01:03.989> up<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.140> edit<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.769> define<00:01:05.729> brush<00:01:06.240> preset

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
go up to edit and define brush preset

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.170 
go up to edit and define brush preset
just<00:01:07.260> name<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.740> whatever<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.580> they<00:01:08.790> mine<00:01:09.060> here

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
okay now just close that off we don't

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.680 
okay now just close that off we don't
really<00:01:15.270> need<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.570> anymore<00:01:15.990> don't<00:01:16.979> save<00:01:17.190> it

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
really need that anymore don't save it

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.050 
really need that anymore don't save it
now<00:01:18.690> when<00:01:18.869> we're<00:01:18.990> back<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:19.409> one<00:01:20.659> now

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
now when we're back to this one now

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.570 
now when we're back to this one now
scroll<00:01:24.060> down<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.960> there<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.470> your<00:01:25.920> brush

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.200 

right<00:01:29.580> so<00:01:30.270> now<00:01:30.509> if<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.979> haven't<00:01:32.220> already<00:01:32.430> go

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
up to windows and then select brushes

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.249 
up to windows and then select brushes
make<00:01:38.880> sure<00:01:38.910> you've<00:01:39.119> got<00:01:39.149> your<00:01:39.270> brush<00:01:39.690> selected

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
make sure you've got your brush selected

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.940 
make sure you've got your brush selected
and<00:01:41.509> then<00:01:42.509> go<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.940> go<00:01:44.940> to<00:01:45.000> shape<00:01:45.690> dynamics<00:01:45.990> and

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
and then go to go to shape dynamics and

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.279 
and then go to go to shape dynamics and
make<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.250> angle<00:01:47.670> jitter<00:01:47.819> 30<00:01:48.539> just<00:01:49.110> leave

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
make the angle jitter 30 just leave

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:51.050 
make the angle jitter 30 just leave
everything<00:01:49.409> else<00:01:49.770> as<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.190> is<00:01:50.340> in<00:01:50.550> there<00:01:50.789> and

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
everything else as it is in there and

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.340 
everything else as it is in there and
then<00:01:51.869> we<00:01:52.020> go<00:01:52.140> down<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.909> color<00:01:53.909> dynamics<00:01:54.569> leave

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
then we go down to color dynamics leave

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.639 
then we go down to color dynamics leave
the<00:01:55.530> top<00:01:55.679> 10<00:01:56.280> make<00:01:56.940> the<00:01:57.149> next<00:01:57.300> one<00:01:57.710> 20<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.210> then

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
the top 10 make the next one 20 and then

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.240 
the top 10 make the next one 20 and then
make<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.860> next<00:02:02.039> one<00:02:02.659> 25<00:02:03.770> then<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:05.069> one<00:02:05.220> after

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
make the next one 25 then the one after

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.509 
make the next one 25 then the one after
that<00:02:05.580> 15<00:02:06.360> then<00:02:06.930> that<00:02:07.170> 10<00:02:08.720> then<00:02:09.720> after<00:02:10.709> that<00:02:10.890> go

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
that 15 then that 10 then after that go

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.479 
that 15 then that 10 then after that go
down<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:12.030> all<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:13.230> dynamics<00:02:13.440> make<00:02:14.310> the

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
down to all the dynamics make the

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.590 
down to all the dynamics make the
opacity<00:02:14.850> Jeter<00:02:15.450> fifty<00:02:15.959> percent<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.500> then<00:02:17.600> get

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
opacity Jeter fifty percent and then get

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.400 
opacity Jeter fifty percent and then get
out<00:02:18.630> of<00:02:18.870> that<00:02:18.989> now<00:02:20.269> make<00:02:21.269> your<00:02:21.480> brush<00:02:21.600> size<00:02:21.660> a

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
out of that now make your brush size a

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.020 
out of that now make your brush size a
little<00:02:22.620> bit<00:02:22.829> smaller<00:02:23.130> for<00:02:23.459> mine<00:02:23.640> i'm<00:02:23.850> going<00:02:23.970> to

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
little bit smaller for mine i'm going to

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.130 
little bit smaller for mine i'm going to
put<00:02:24.180> mine<00:02:24.360> it<00:02:24.570> know<00:02:24.870> about<00:02:25.320> 10<00:02:25.709> or<00:02:25.860> so<00:02:27.019> zoom<00:02:28.019> in

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
put mine it know about 10 or so zoom in

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.360 
put mine it know about 10 or so zoom in
a<00:02:28.200> bit<00:02:28.290> so<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:28.620> can<00:02:28.680> actually<00:02:28.860> get<00:02:29.130> a<00:02:29.190> good

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
a bit so you can actually get a good

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.080 
a bit so you can actually get a good
look<00:02:30.799> now<00:02:31.799> go<00:02:31.980> back<00:02:32.130> to<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.370> brush<00:02:32.549> why<00:02:32.940> it's

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
look now go back to the brush why it's

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.640 
look now go back to the brush why it's
probably<00:02:33.510> still<00:02:33.780> a<00:02:33.840> bit<00:02:33.989> too<00:02:34.170> big<00:02:34.320> so<00:02:34.560> i'll

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
probably still a bit too big so i'll

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.410 
probably still a bit too big so i'll
just<00:02:34.680> make<00:02:34.920> that<00:02:35.100> a<00:02:35.130> little<00:02:35.370> bit<00:02:35.430> smaller<00:02:35.670> bro

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
just make that a little bit smaller bro

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.480 
just make that a little bit smaller bro
that'll<00:02:36.780> do

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.010 

alright<00:02:40.490> make<00:02:40.820> the<00:02:40.970> color<00:02:41.180> whatever<00:02:41.690> the<00:02:41.780> hair

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
alright make the color whatever the hair

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.680 
alright make the color whatever the hair
color<00:02:42.260> is<00:02:42.970> I'm<00:02:43.970> just<00:02:44.210> going<00:02:44.300> to<00:02:44.450> stick<00:02:44.660> with

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
color is I'm just going to stick with

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.260 
color is I'm just going to stick with
black<00:02:45.020> for<00:02:45.230> this<00:02:45.350> one<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:48.290> then<00:02:48.790> try<00:02:49.790> and<00:02:49.820> draw

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
black for this one and then try and draw
