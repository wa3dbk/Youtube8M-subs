bug<00:03:54.729> population<00:03:55.389> a<00:03:55.419> little<00:03:55.509> bit<00:03:55.780> but<00:03:56.349> it<00:03:56.439> is<00:03:56.560> a

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
bug population a little bit but it is a

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.409 
bug population a little bit but it is a
place<00:03:56.949> where<00:03:56.979> the<00:03:57.250> Wolves<00:03:57.549> like<00:03:57.699> to<00:03:57.849> lay<00:03:58.060> when

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:58.419 
place where the Wolves like to lay when

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:00.809 
place where the Wolves like to lay when
it<00:03:58.540> rains<00:03:58.810> the<00:03:59.349> eaves<00:03:59.620> of<00:03:59.829> the<00:03:59.919> building<00:04:00.280> puts

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
it rains the eaves of the building puts

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:02.309 
it rains the eaves of the building puts
them<00:04:00.969> right<00:04:01.000> next<00:04:01.449> to<00:04:01.659> their<00:04:01.930> windows

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
them right next to their windows

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.379 
them right next to their windows
observation<00:04:03.189> windows<00:04:03.489> and<00:04:03.669> when<00:04:04.239> it's

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:04.389 
observation windows and when it's

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:05.069 
observation windows and when it's
raining

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
raining

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.110 
raining
the<00:04:05.409> bugs<00:04:05.620> kind<00:04:05.859> of<00:04:05.949> congregate<00:04:06.549> a<00:04:06.699> little<00:04:07.030> bit

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
the bugs kind of congregate a little bit

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.729 
the bugs kind of congregate a little bit
underneath<00:04:07.479> that<00:04:07.810> eaves<00:04:08.109> out<00:04:08.379> of<00:04:08.469> the<00:04:08.560> rain

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
underneath that eaves out of the rain

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.009 
underneath that eaves out of the rain
and<00:04:09.009> so<00:04:09.159> having<00:04:09.909> those<00:04:10.030> chips<00:04:10.389> helps<00:04:10.689> keep<00:04:10.870> the

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
and so having those chips helps keep the

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:13.770 
and so having those chips helps keep the
vegetation<00:04:11.620> down<00:04:11.799> the<00:04:12.699> cedar<00:04:12.969> oils<00:04:13.329> give<00:04:13.599> them

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
vegetation down the cedar oils give them

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.560 
vegetation down the cedar oils give them
a<00:04:13.810> little<00:04:14.109> bit<00:04:14.349> of<00:04:14.500> covering<00:04:15.069> and<00:04:15.250> we<00:04:16.090> also<00:04:16.239> do

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
a little bit of covering and we also do

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.810 
a little bit of covering and we also do
some<00:04:16.599> fly<00:04:17.079> spray<00:04:17.380> with<00:04:17.590> them<00:04:17.769> but<00:04:17.979> it's<00:04:18.699> a

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
some fly spray with them but it's a

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.310 
some fly spray with them but it's a
comfortable<00:04:19.269> place<00:04:19.419> for<00:04:19.509> them<00:04:19.780> to<00:04:19.840> rest<00:04:19.930> and

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
comfortable place for them to rest and

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.539 
comfortable place for them to rest and
it's<00:04:20.409> certainly<00:04:20.680> a<00:04:20.769> place<00:04:21.009> for<00:04:21.159> them<00:04:21.280> to<00:04:21.430> get

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
it's certainly a place for them to get

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.060 
it's certainly a place for them to get
away<00:04:21.639> from<00:04:21.940> from<00:04:22.479> some<00:04:22.750> bugs<00:04:22.960> so<00:04:23.229> luna<00:04:23.800> likes

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
away from from some bugs so luna likes

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.390 
away from from some bugs so luna likes
it<00:04:24.279> all<00:04:24.430> four<00:04:24.760> of<00:04:24.789> them<00:04:25.060> fit<00:04:25.360> there

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
it all four of them fit there

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.219 
it all four of them fit there
if<00:04:26.460> you<00:04:27.120> were<00:04:27.240> on<00:04:27.389> a<00:04:27.419> working<00:04:27.630> for<00:04:27.900> wolves

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
if you were on a working for wolves

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:31.249 
if you were on a working for wolves
program<00:04:28.979> a<00:04:29.160> few<00:04:29.430> years<00:04:29.940> ago<00:04:30.240> you'll<00:04:31.080> remember

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:31.259 
program a few years ago you'll remember

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:33.050 
program a few years ago you'll remember
when<00:04:31.680> we<00:04:31.800> move<00:04:32.009> those<00:04:32.220> rocks<00:04:32.340> so<00:04:32.759> we<00:04:32.790> could

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
when we move those rocks so we could

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.270 
when we move those rocks so we could
accommodate<00:04:33.360> out<00:04:33.690> for<00:04:33.930> wolves<00:04:34.110> over<00:04:34.500> in

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
accommodate out for wolves over in

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.670 
accommodate out for wolves over in
Grizzlies<00:04:35.669> area<00:04:36.030> he<00:04:36.419> loves<00:04:36.900> them<00:04:37.050> as<00:04:37.199> well

there's a kennel area with a roof for

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:47.210 
there's a kennel area with a roof for
gryzor<00:04:45.660> to<00:04:46.259> get<00:04:46.410> out<00:04:46.500> of<00:04:46.620> the<00:04:46.680> rain<00:04:46.830> he<00:04:47.070> also

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
gryzor to get out of the rain he also

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.700 
gryzor to get out of the rain he also
has<00:04:47.520> a<00:04:47.550> den<00:04:47.880> grazers<00:04:48.630> got<00:04:48.810> several<00:04:49.169> places<00:04:49.380> for

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
has a den grazers got several places for

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.219 
has a den grazers got several places for
him<00:04:49.800> to<00:04:49.889> go<00:04:50.009> but<00:04:50.639> he<00:04:50.699> rolled<00:04:51.600> in<00:04:51.840> it<00:04:51.990> he

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
him to go but he rolled in it he

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:54.350 
him to go but he rolled in it he
scattered<00:04:52.770> it<00:04:52.889> around<00:04:53.190> and<00:04:53.520> then<00:04:54.090> he

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
scattered it around and then he

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.820 
scattered it around and then he
proceeded<00:04:54.840> to<00:04:54.960> fall<00:04:55.410> asleep<00:04:56.039> in<00:04:56.340> the<00:04:56.970> chip<00:04:57.240> so

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
proceeded to fall asleep in the chip so

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.500 
proceeded to fall asleep in the chip so
he<00:04:58.830> was<00:04:59.010> quite<00:04:59.250> relaxed<00:04:59.760> and<00:04:59.910> so<00:05:00.090> this<00:05:00.300> is

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
he was quite relaxed and so this is

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.710 
he was quite relaxed and so this is
another<00:05:01.020> area<00:05:01.139> where<00:05:02.210> he<00:05:03.210> gets<00:05:03.389> out<00:05:03.570> of<00:05:03.600> the

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
another area where he gets out of the

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.170 
another area where he gets out of the
rain<00:05:03.930> so<00:05:04.430> sometimes<00:05:05.430> when<00:05:05.610> it's<00:05:05.729> really<00:05:05.880> rainy

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
rain so sometimes when it's really rainy

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.969 
rain so sometimes when it's really rainy
and<00:05:06.479> it<00:05:06.960> can<00:05:07.110> get<00:05:07.229> really<00:05:07.289> buggy<00:05:07.650> under<00:05:07.889> the

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
and it can get really buggy under the

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:10.270 
and it can get really buggy under the
eaves<00:05:08.190> it<00:05:08.760> was<00:05:08.970> a<00:05:09.000> it's<00:05:09.479> a<00:05:09.600> good<00:05:09.750> place<00:05:09.960> to

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
eaves it was a it's a good place to

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.640 
eaves it was a it's a good place to
saturate<00:05:11.280> that<00:05:11.340> with<00:05:11.639> cedar<00:05:11.850> chips<00:05:12.090> and<00:05:12.419> he<00:05:13.080> he

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
saturate that with cedar chips and he he

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.980 
saturate that with cedar chips and he he
again<00:05:14.039> as<00:05:14.250> obviously<00:05:14.610> you<00:05:15.600> could<00:05:15.750> tell

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
again as obviously you could tell

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.310 
again as obviously you could tell
rolling<00:05:16.949> in<00:05:17.070> it<00:05:17.220> and<00:05:17.660> covered<00:05:18.660> himself<00:05:18.780> up

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
rolling in it and covered himself up

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.750 
rolling in it and covered himself up
with<00:05:20.250> chips<00:05:20.580> and<00:05:20.960> then<00:05:21.960> also<00:05:22.430> like<00:05:23.430> I<00:05:23.460> said

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
with chips and then also like I said

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.740 
with chips and then also like I said
falling<00:05:24.060> asleep<00:05:24.330> with<00:05:24.509> it<00:05:24.539> so<00:05:25.280> gryzor<00:05:26.280> is<00:05:26.750> not

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
falling asleep with it so gryzor is not

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.930 
falling asleep with it so gryzor is not
quite<00:05:28.020> finished<00:05:28.289> shedding<00:05:28.770> he's<00:05:29.250> got<00:05:29.460> his<00:05:29.669> mid

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
quite finished shedding he's got his mid

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:35.089 
quite finished shedding he's got his mid
body<00:05:30.240> is<00:05:30.630> shed<00:05:30.990> out<00:05:31.199> his<00:05:31.860> neck<00:05:32.310> is<00:05:32.580> not<00:05:33.419> shed<00:05:34.099> so

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:35.099 
body is shed out his neck is not shed so

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:37.700 
body is shed out his neck is not shed so
we<00:05:35.370> were<00:05:35.460> working<00:05:35.849> on<00:05:36.000> that<00:05:36.229> every<00:05:37.229> wolf<00:05:37.380> seems

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
we were working on that every wolf seems

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.909 
we were working on that every wolf seems
to<00:05:37.889> shed<00:05:38.130> in<00:05:38.370> a<00:05:38.490> different<00:05:38.940> pattern<00:05:39.150> and

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:39.919 
to shed in a different pattern and

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:44.719 
to shed in a different pattern and
Grizzard<00:05:40.919> is<00:05:41.659> unique<00:05:42.659> in<00:05:42.900> that<00:05:43.039> he<00:05:44.039> sheds<00:05:44.400> his

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
Grizzard is unique in that he sheds his

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:48.260
