before<00:00:01.260> we<00:00:01.380> install<00:00:01.500> our<00:00:01.770> drain<00:00:02.010> plugs<00:00:02.250> we

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
before we install our drain plugs we

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:03.649 
before we install our drain plugs we
want<00:00:02.550> to<00:00:02.639> make<00:00:02.760> sure<00:00:02.790> they're<00:00:03.090> nice<00:00:03.240> and<00:00:03.449> clean

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:09.320 
tips and you'll see that there are

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.470 
tips and you'll see that there are
magnets<00:00:10.320> on<00:00:10.710> each<00:00:10.950> tip<00:00:11.250> of<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.550> drain<00:00:11.790> plug<00:00:11.940> so

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
magnets on each tip of the drain plug so

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.289 
magnets on each tip of the drain plug so
what<00:00:12.599> I'll<00:00:12.690> do<00:00:12.840> is<00:00:12.870> I'll<00:00:13.080> clean<00:00:13.380> them<00:00:13.559> off<00:00:14.299> get

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
then for the drain plugs that require

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.930 
then for the drain plugs that require
o'rings<00:00:40.050> we'll<00:00:40.350> put<00:00:40.950> brand<00:00:41.219> new<00:00:41.340> o-rings<00:00:41.790> on

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.960 
an inspection cover and I will look down
this<00:02:14.870> inspection<00:02:15.380> cover<00:02:15.709> to<00:02:16.100> see<00:02:16.310> our<00:02:16.670> oil

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
this inspection cover to see our oil

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.340 
this inspection cover to see our oil
level<00:02:17.450> and<00:02:17.769> well<00:02:18.769> no<00:02:18.920> it's<00:02:19.100> correct<00:02:19.570> when<00:02:20.570> the

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.259 
oil comes in contact with the bottom
portion<00:02:24.320> of<00:02:24.530> this<00:02:24.680> diaphragm<00:02:25.070> spring<00:02:25.310> at<00:02:26.239> the

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
portion of this diaphragm spring at the

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.870 
portion of this diaphragm spring at the
base<00:02:26.660> you<00:02:27.530> don't<00:02:27.709> want<00:02:27.860> to<00:02:27.950> go<00:02:28.070> by<00:02:28.250> a<00:02:28.280> specified

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
base you don't want to go by a specified

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.860 
base you don't want to go by a specified
amount<00:02:28.910> of<00:02:29.420> oil<00:02:29.630> you<00:02:30.290> want<00:02:30.500> to<00:02:30.620> check<00:02:30.830> and<00:02:31.220> see

amount of oil you want to check and see

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.660 
amount of oil you want to check and see
when<00:02:32.870> it<00:02:33.019> gets<00:02:33.200> to<00:02:33.380> that<00:02:33.410> exact<00:02:33.950> point<00:02:33.980> then

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
when it gets to that exact point then

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.890 
when it gets to that exact point then
you<00:02:34.700> know<00:02:34.970> you<00:02:35.030> are<00:02:35.780> correct<00:02:37.450> so<00:02:38.450> while<00:02:38.750> I'm

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
you know you are correct so while I'm

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.280 
you know you are correct so while I'm
looking<00:02:39.049> at<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:41.420> diaphragm<00:02:41.900> spring<00:02:41.930> I'm

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
looking at the diaphragm spring I'm

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.479 
looking at the diaphragm spring I'm
going<00:02:42.410> to<00:02:42.500> go<00:02:42.560> ahead<00:02:42.590> and<00:02:42.860> start<00:02:43.040> adding<00:02:43.250> my

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
going to go ahead and start adding my

00:02:43.489 --> 00:03:00.490 
going to go ahead and start adding my
oil

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.250 

there<00:03:01.250> we<00:03:01.430> go<00:03:01.580> now<00:03:02.060> it<00:03:02.240> just<00:03:02.600> touched<00:03:02.900> the

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
there we go now it just touched the

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.070
