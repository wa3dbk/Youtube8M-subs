little roof this side nearly the same

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.150 
little roof this side nearly the same
thing<00:02:48.870> except<00:02:49.320> it's<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.500> little<00:02:49.740> easier<00:02:50.070> on

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
thing except it's a little easier on

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.740 
thing except it's a little easier on
this<00:02:50.400> side<00:02:50.640> because<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:52.850> the<00:02:53.850> wheels<00:02:54.180> there

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
this side because the the wheels there

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.500 
this side because the the wheels there
the<00:02:55.260> wheels<00:02:55.470> here<00:02:55.740> so<00:02:56.400> see<00:02:56.880> it<00:02:57.180> goes<00:02:57.330> all<00:02:57.450> the

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
the wheels here so see it goes all the

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.610 
the wheels here so see it goes all the
way<00:02:57.570> back<00:02:57.630> like<00:02:57.900> that<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.260> it's<00:02:58.380> just<00:02:58.440> a

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
way back like that and it's just a

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.800 
way back like that and it's just a
straight<00:02:58.860> drop<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.370> it's<00:03:00.060> like<00:03:00.270> nothing<00:03:00.690> but

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
straight drop and it's like nothing but

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.260 
straight drop and it's like nothing but
air<00:03:00.990> back<00:03:01.230> there<00:03:01.440> so<00:03:02.310> this<00:03:02.910> one's<00:03:03.120> a<00:03:03.180> little

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
air back there so this one's a little

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.970 
air back there so this one's a little
more<00:03:03.420> complicated<00:03:03.660> but<00:03:04.260> you<00:03:04.500> know<00:03:04.620> you<00:03:04.710> pretty

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
more complicated but you know you pretty

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.620 
more complicated but you know you pretty
much<00:03:05.100> get<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.460> idea<00:03:05.790> you<00:03:05.970> stick<00:03:06.210> it<00:03:06.300> on<00:03:06.360> top

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
much get the idea you stick it on top

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.330 
much get the idea you stick it on top
let<00:03:06.990> me<00:03:07.110> see<00:03:07.800> if<00:03:07.860> I<00:03:07.950> show<00:03:08.220> you<00:03:09.770> see<00:03:10.770> how<00:03:10.920> this<00:03:11.100> is
