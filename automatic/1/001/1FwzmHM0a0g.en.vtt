now okay then once you get it done like

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.120 
now okay then once you get it done like
this<00:01:56.000> you<00:01:57.000> take<00:01:57.390> cellophane<00:01:58.140> tape<00:01:58.170> or<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:59.009> can

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
this you take cellophane tape or you can

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.620 
this you take cellophane tape or you can
take<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.280> duct<00:01:59.460> tape<00:01:59.640> but<00:01:59.850> cellophane<00:02:00.509> is

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
take a duct tape but cellophane is

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.590 
take a duct tape but cellophane is
easier<00:02:00.899> kinder<00:02:01.439> go<00:02:01.530> ahead<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.329> push<00:02:03.329> them<00:02:03.479> on

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
easier kinder go ahead and push them on

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.359 
easier kinder go ahead and push them on
there<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:03.990> then<00:02:04.439> you<00:02:04.560> cover<00:02:04.740> up<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:04.950> edges

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
there and then you cover up the edges

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.789 
there and then you cover up the edges
with<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.670> tape<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.290> the<00:02:07.290> reason<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.649> do<00:02:07.770> this

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
with the tape and the reason you do this

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.400 
with the tape and the reason you do this
is<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.099> it<00:02:08.190> holds<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.729> form<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.660> of<00:02:10.080> the

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
is so it holds the form of the of the

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.559 
is so it holds the form of the of the
bottle<00:02:10.920> okay<00:02:11.550> and<00:02:11.760> so<00:02:11.879> that's<00:02:12.030> all<00:02:12.150> you<00:02:12.270> do<00:02:12.390> and

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
bottle okay and so that's all you do and

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.760 
bottle okay and so that's all you do and
you<00:02:12.750> just<00:02:12.900> put<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.140> tape<00:02:13.290> over<00:02:13.379> the

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
you just put the tape over the

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.410 
you just put the tape over the
up<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.040> then<00:02:14.490> that's<00:02:14.670> going<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:14.850> be<00:02:14.940> hidden<00:02:15.180> so

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
up and then that's going to be hidden so

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.210 
up and then that's going to be hidden so
you<00:02:15.450> won't<00:02:15.660> ever<00:02:15.780> see<00:02:16.050> that<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.890> you<00:02:17.040> take<00:02:17.190> a

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
you won't ever see that and you take a

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.710 
you won't ever see that and you take a
piece<00:02:17.430> of<00:02:17.580> paper<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:17.970> cut<00:02:18.240> this<00:02:18.420> you<00:02:18.570> can

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
piece of paper and I cut this you can

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.510 
piece of paper and I cut this you can
use<00:02:18.840> scrapbook<00:02:19.260> paper<00:02:19.500> or<00:02:19.770> wrapping<00:02:19.890> paper<00:02:20.310> it

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
use scrapbook paper or wrapping paper it

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.010 
use scrapbook paper or wrapping paper it
really<00:02:20.550> doesn't<00:02:21.000> matter<00:02:21.060> looks<00:02:21.570> like<00:02:21.720> you<00:02:21.870> had

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
really doesn't matter looks like you had

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.180 
really doesn't matter looks like you had
to<00:02:22.110> take<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.260> couple<00:02:22.500> pieces<00:02:22.710> and<00:02:23.010> put<00:02:23.160> them

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
to take a couple pieces and put them

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.100 
to take a couple pieces and put them
together<00:02:23.370> I<00:02:23.820> did<00:02:24.060> I<00:02:24.270> did<00:02:24.510> I<00:02:24.540> made<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:24.930> little

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
together I did I did I made it a little

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.540 
together I did I did I made it a little
bit<00:02:25.260> longer<00:02:25.410> I<00:02:25.530> measured<00:02:25.920> around<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.250> bottle

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
bit longer I measured around the bottle

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.530 
bit longer I measured around the bottle
and<00:02:26.670> so<00:02:26.760> you<00:02:26.850> can<00:02:27.000> see<00:02:27.120> where<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.360> original

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
and so you can see where the original

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.270 
and so you can see where the original
I'm<00:02:28.140> going<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:28.560> want<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:28.740> make<00:02:28.830> it<00:02:28.920> this<00:02:29.040> wide

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
I'm going to want to make it this wide

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.980 
I'm going to want to make it this wide
it<00:02:29.580> is<00:02:29.700> whatever<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.300> original<00:02:30.660> length<00:02:30.810> of

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
it is whatever the original length of

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.930 
it is whatever the original length of
the<00:02:31.080> label<00:02:31.770> is<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:32.100> take<00:02:32.280> a<00:02:32.310> simple<00:02:32.550> glue

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
the label is you take a simple glue
