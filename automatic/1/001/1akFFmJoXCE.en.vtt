of the harder moves to be honest I'm
still<00:00:14.639> learning<00:00:14.730> myself<00:00:15.000> so<00:00:15.509> you<00:00:16.350> know<00:00:16.470> I

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
still learning myself so you know I

still learning myself so you know I
don't<00:00:16.830> have<00:00:16.920> certain<00:00:17.279> instructions<00:00:17.699> up<00:00:18.029> for<00:00:18.270> a

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
don't have certain instructions up for a

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.160 
don't have certain instructions up for a
reason

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
reason

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.560 
reason
but<00:00:19.590> I<00:00:19.770> did<00:00:20.039> say<00:00:20.400> Oh<00:00:20.430> someone<00:00:20.789> requested<00:00:21.210> the

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
but I did say Oh someone requested the

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.779 
but I did say Oh someone requested the
simplest<00:00:22.230> vowel<00:00:22.619> so<00:00:22.830> move<00:00:23.070> that<00:00:23.550> there<00:00:23.670> is

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
simplest vowel so move that there is

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.019 
simplest vowel so move that there is
that's<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.779> basic<00:00:25.230> horizontal<00:00:25.830> opening<00:00:26.160> okay

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
that's the basic horizontal opening okay

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.849 
that's the basic horizontal opening okay
this<00:00:27.300> is<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.689> first<00:00:27.930> move<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:28.500> I've<00:00:28.619> done

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
this is the first move that I've done

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.070 
this is the first move that I've done
with<00:00:29.279> this<00:00:29.400> battle<00:00:29.699> song<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:30.689> know<00:00:30.779> I<00:00:30.810> first

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
with this battle song you know I first

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.549 
with this battle song you know I first
picked<00:00:31.260> up<00:00:31.380> about<00:00:31.590> some<00:00:31.980> years<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.399> years<00:00:32.550> ago

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:36.049 
picked up about some years and years ago
this<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.710> probably<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.040> most<00:00:35.160> natural<00:00:35.460> move

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
this is probably the most natural move

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.490 
this is probably the most natural move
this<00:00:36.390> is<00:00:36.510> actually<00:00:36.809> something<00:00:37.020> that<00:00:37.170> no<00:00:37.380> one

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
this is actually something that no one
