if I understand correctly this folding

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.170 
if I understand correctly this folding
bike<00:01:12.560> was<00:01:12.860> actually<00:01:13.370> engineered<00:01:13.880> by<00:01:14.150> the

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
bike was actually engineered by the

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.310 
bike was actually engineered by the
people<00:01:14.630> that<00:01:14.659> Montague<00:01:15.259> and<00:01:17.229> their<00:01:18.229> an

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
American company so a little more a

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.580 
American company so a little more a
little<00:01:21.259> more<00:01:21.740> into<00:01:22.070> the<00:01:22.189> mix<00:01:22.430> there<00:01:23.409> but<00:01:24.409> that

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
little more into the mix there but that

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.620 
little more into the mix there but that

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
work I would show you I would show you

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:36.940 
work I would show you I would show you
the<00:01:30.619> bike<00:01:30.770> folded<00:01:31.840> but<00:01:34.149> the<00:01:35.590> volna<00:01:36.590> magnums

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
the bike folded but the volna magnums

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.920 
the bike folded but the volna magnums
mechanisms<00:01:37.700> are<00:01:37.850> kind<00:01:38.030> of<00:01:38.090> stiff<00:01:38.390> maybe<00:01:38.750> we

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
mechanisms are kind of stiff maybe we

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.950 
mechanisms are kind of stiff maybe we
lubricated<00:01:41.259> but<00:01:42.259> the<00:01:42.530> seat<00:01:43.369> post<00:01:44.149> holds<00:01:44.869> it

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
lubricated but the seat post holds it

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.929 
lubricated but the seat post holds it
together<00:01:45.079> and<00:01:47.049> there's<00:01:48.049> two<00:01:48.320> joints<00:01:48.770> up<00:01:49.490> here

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
together and there's two joints up here

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.560 
together and there's two joints up here
and<00:01:50.119> down<00:01:50.479> there<00:01:51.880> this<00:01:52.880> is<00:01:53.000> pretty<00:01:53.210> much<00:01:53.270> all<00:01:53.509> I

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
and down there this is pretty much all I

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.319 
and down there this is pretty much all I
got<00:01:53.719> with<00:01:54.109> the<00:01:54.229> purchase<00:01:54.969> once<00:01:55.969> again<00:01:56.179> it<00:01:56.270> was

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
got with the purchase once again it was

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:02.230 
got with the purchase once again it was
cheap<00:01:56.600> but<00:01:57.219> there's<00:01:58.219> no<00:01:58.369> wheels<00:01:58.689> no<00:01:59.829> seat<00:02:01.240> so

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
cheap but there's no wheels no seat so

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.490 
cheap but there's no wheels no seat so
I'm<00:02:02.299> gonna<00:02:02.390> have<00:02:02.509> to<00:02:02.570> track<00:02:02.780> down<00:02:02.960> some<00:02:03.200> parts

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
I'm gonna have to track down some parts

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.779 
I'm gonna have to track down some parts
but<00:02:04.100> it's<00:02:04.369> all<00:02:04.549> fairly<00:02:04.880> standard<00:02:05.450> nineties

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
but it's all fairly standard nineties

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:11.230 
but it's all fairly standard nineties
fairly<00:02:07.789> low-end<00:02:08.030> mountain<00:02:08.690> bike<00:02:08.840> stuff<00:02:10.240> I

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
fairly low-end mountain bike stuff I

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.350 
fairly low-end mountain bike stuff I
mean<00:02:11.690> this<00:02:11.840> was<00:02:12.700> let's<00:02:13.700> see<00:02:13.820> the<00:02:13.910> component

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
mean this was let's see the component

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.760 
mean this was let's see the component
here<00:02:14.420> this<00:02:14.570> was<00:02:14.720> really<00:02:14.960> an<00:02:15.320> entry-level

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
here this was really an entry-level

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.210 
here this was really an entry-level
mountain<00:02:16.280> bike<00:02:16.720> you<00:02:17.720> know<00:02:17.840> for<00:02:18.530> them<00:02:18.650> for<00:02:19.129> the

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
mountain bike you know for them for the

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.960 
mountain bike you know for them for the
mid<00:02:19.580> nineties<00:02:20.510> so

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
mid nineties so

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.150 
mid nineties so
components<00:02:23.750> should<00:02:23.930> be<00:02:24.110> easy<00:02:24.740> enough<00:02:24.860> to<00:02:25.040> find

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
components should be easy enough to find

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.240 
components should be easy enough to find
and<00:02:25.490> I<00:02:25.520> can<00:02:25.670> do<00:02:25.760> some<00:02:25.910> upgrades<00:02:26.030> along<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.660> way

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
and I can do some upgrades along the way

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.760 
and I can do some upgrades along the way
but<00:02:28.250> this<00:02:29.060> one<00:02:29.240> here<00:02:29.570> has<00:02:30.080> an<00:02:30.200> advantage<00:02:30.680> over

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
but this one here has an advantage over

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.710 
but this one here has an advantage over
the<00:02:31.040> de<00:02:31.160> Haan<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:31.610> that<00:02:31.730> this<00:02:31.940> is<00:02:32.120> a<00:02:32.240> full<00:02:32.450> size

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
the de Haan and that this is a full size

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.490 
the de Haan and that this is a full size
26<00:02:33.320> inch<00:02:33.500> folder<00:02:34.300> whereas<00:02:35.300> the<00:02:35.450> de<00:02:35.570> Haan<00:02:35.780> is<00:02:36.200> a

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
26 inch folder whereas the de Haan is a

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.830 
26 inch folder whereas the de Haan is a
smaller<00:02:37.280> bike<00:02:37.520> and<00:02:37.820> I<00:02:38.360> I<00:02:38.930> do<00:02:39.260> prefer<00:02:39.710> the<00:02:40.840> the

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
smaller bike and I I do prefer the the

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.750 
smaller bike and I I do prefer the the
gearing<00:02:42.110> standard<00:02:42.890> year<00:02:43.040> with<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:43.310> derailers

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
gearing standard year with the derailers

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.830 
gearing standard year with the derailers
