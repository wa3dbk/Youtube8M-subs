couple<00:01:47.040> more<00:01:47.250> choices<00:01:47.549> than<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:47.909> does<00:01:48.060> then

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
couple more choices than it does then

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.560 
couple more choices than it does then
the<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:49.170> in-game<00:01:49.880> scorpion<00:01:50.880> king<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.390> can

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
the the in-game scorpion king so you can

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.880 
the the in-game scorpion king so you can
actually<00:01:51.689> cut<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.140> probably<00:01:52.290> look<00:01:52.500> on<00:01:52.680> to

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
actually cut it to probably look on to

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.679 
actually cut it to probably look on to
put<00:01:53.040> on<00:01:53.159> semi<00:01:53.460> trailers<00:01:53.790> so<00:01:54.299> it'll<00:01:54.540> actually

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
put on semi trailers so it'll actually

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.810 
put on semi trailers so it'll actually
do<00:01:54.899> pretty<00:01:55.079> good

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.340 

since<00:01:58.480> we're<00:01:58.600> actually<00:01:58.720> already<00:01:58.930> in<00:01:59.140> here

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
since we're actually already in here

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.660 
since we're actually already in here
we're<00:01:59.560> gonna<00:01:59.740> probably<00:02:00.040> go<00:02:00.220> ahead<00:02:00.280> and<00:02:00.370> test

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
we're gonna probably go ahead and test

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.390 
we're gonna probably go ahead and test
it<00:02:00.820> out<00:02:00.910> already<00:02:04.740> make<00:02:05.740> sure<00:02:05.890> that<00:02:06.010> these<00:02:06.190> are

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
it out already make sure that these are

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:26.150 
it out already make sure that these are
set<00:02:06.790> to<00:02:07.300> five<00:02:07.690> and<00:02:07.840> half<00:02:07.960> meters<00:02:09.420> there's<00:02:10.420> that

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.010 

now<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.790> bad<00:02:27.030> part<00:02:27.240> about<00:02:27.270> this<00:02:27.480> is<00:02:27.690> it<00:02:27.720> does

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
now the bad part about this is it does

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.390 
now the bad part about this is it does
leave<00:02:28.230> some<00:02:28.530> limbs<00:02:28.740> did<00:02:28.980> you<00:02:29.040> have<00:02:29.130> to<00:02:29.220> come

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
leave some limbs did you have to come

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.400 
leave some limbs did you have to come
back<00:02:29.550> with<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.730> chainsaw<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.480> cut<00:02:30.540> off

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
back with a chainsaw and cut off

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.180 
back with a chainsaw and cut off
yourself

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
yourself

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.130 
yourself
most<00:02:32.640> of<00:02:32.850> it'll<00:02:33.180> get<00:02:33.330> 90%<00:02:33.570> of<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:33.930> betel-leaf

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
most of it'll get 90% of a betel-leaf

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.470 
most of it'll get 90% of a betel-leaf
probably<00:02:34.860> a<00:02:35.040> couple<00:02:35.880> of<00:02:36.000> them<00:02:36.090> Oh<00:02:36.150> kinda<00:02:36.390> like

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
probably a couple of them Oh kinda like

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.640 
probably a couple of them Oh kinda like
you<00:02:36.600> seen<00:02:36.780> there<00:02:36.990> with<00:02:37.140> these<00:02:37.260> two<00:02:37.320> right<00:02:37.650> here

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.960 

but<00:02:43.650> it<00:02:43.770> basically<00:02:43.890> operates<00:02:44.430> in<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.730> same

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
but it basically operates in the same

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.740 
but it basically operates in the same
way<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:46.580> all<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:48.030> other<00:02:48.210> Scorpion<00:02:49.200> Kings<00:02:49.380> do

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
way the all the other Scorpion Kings do

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.790 
way the all the other Scorpion Kings do
come<00:02:51.750> back<00:02:51.840> with<00:02:51.990> a<00:02:52.050> chain<00:02:52.230> saw<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:52.530> just<00:02:52.680> cut

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
come back with a chain saw and just cut

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.120 
come back with a chain saw and just cut
these<00:02:53.010> off<00:02:53.190> real<00:02:53.310> quick

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.030 

maybe<00:02:58.000> if<00:02:58.240> we<00:02:58.360> can<00:02:58.480> actually<00:02:58.600> get<00:02:58.840> to<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:59.040> some

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
maybe if we can actually get to the some

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.950 
maybe if we can actually get to the some
of<00:03:00.160> them<00:03:00.280> if<00:03:01.120> not<00:03:01.330> we'll<00:03:01.480> just<00:03:01.600> load<00:03:01.750> them<00:03:01.840> up

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 
of them if not we'll just load them up

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.300 
of them if not we'll just load them up
onto<00:03:02.380> the<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:04.810> forwarder<00:03:05.260> and<00:03:05.440> then<00:03:06.100> cut<00:03:06.250> them

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
onto the the forwarder and then cut them

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.070 
onto the the forwarder and then cut them
from<00:03:06.490> there<00:03:07.710> ready<00:03:09.480> this<00:03:10.480> right<00:03:10.690> here<00:03:10.840> is<00:03:10.930> the

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
from there ready this right here is the

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.130 
from there ready this right here is the
Volvo<00:03:11.800> being<00:03:12.340> boarded<00:03:12.760> you<00:03:13.720> guys<00:03:13.870> can<00:03:14.020> see

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
Volvo being boarded you guys can see

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.660 
Volvo being boarded you guys can see
it's<00:03:14.260> basically<00:03:14.410> like<00:03:14.920> the<00:03:14.980> Buffalo<00:03:15.430> except

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
it's basically like the Buffalo except

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:23.340 
it's basically like the Buffalo except
it's<00:03:15.820> Volvo<00:03:20.490> alright<00:03:21.570> hop<00:03:22.570> into<00:03:22.870> it<00:03:22.900> you<00:03:23.110> can

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
it's Volvo alright hop into it you can

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.670 
it's Volvo alright hop into it you can
change<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:24.460> driving<00:03:24.790> direction<00:03:25.030> with<00:03:25.270> see

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
change the driving direction with see

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:38.750 
change the driving direction with see
kind<00:03:26.680> of<00:03:26.740> like<00:03:26.830> or<00:03:27.610> not<00:03:27.700> with<00:03:27.850> C<00:03:28.060> but<00:03:28.090> with<00:03:28.360> B

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.610 

turn<00:03:39.300> right<00:03:39.480> around<00:03:39.690> there

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.830 

now<00:03:43.220> it<00:03:43.370> does<00:03:43.580> not<00:03:43.610> have<00:03:44.000> any<00:03:44.209> support<00:03:44.390> feet

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
now it does not have any support feet

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.619 
now it does not have any support feet
that<00:03:45.019> you<00:03:45.140> can<00:03:45.290> actually<00:03:45.440> put<00:03:45.800> out<00:03:45.980> though<00:03:46.629> it

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:47.629 
that you can actually put out though it

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:48.610 
that you can actually put out though it
probably<00:03:47.930> really<00:03:47.989> doesn't<00:03:48.319> actually<00:03:48.410> need

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
probably really doesn't actually need

00:03:48.620 --> 00:04:06.490 
probably really doesn't actually need
any<00:03:48.950> though

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.320 

all<00:04:07.190> right<00:04:07.340> let's<00:04:07.520> see<00:04:07.700> if<00:04:07.850> I'll<00:04:08.000> be<00:04:08.150> able<00:04:08.210> to

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
all right let's see if I'll be able to

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.350 
all right let's see if I'll be able to
cut<00:04:08.510> this<00:04:08.630> one<00:04:08.780> off<00:04:08.840> about<00:04:09.170> to<00:04:09.320> dangling<00:04:09.680> there

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:34.090 

there<00:04:14.360> we<00:04:14.510> go<00:04:14.630> perfect

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.650 

no<00:04:34.760> I<00:04:34.790> do<00:04:34.910> not<00:04:35.270> want<00:04:35.450> to<00:04:35.540> jinx<00:04:35.750> myself<00:04:35.810> but<00:04:36.410> my

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
no I do not want to jinx myself but my

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.170 
no I do not want to jinx myself but my
crane<00:04:38.660> ability<00:04:39.320> skills<00:04:39.740> have<00:04:40.250> increased<00:04:40.940> a

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
crane ability skills have increased a

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.050 
crane ability skills have increased a
little<00:04:41.600> bit<00:04:41.750> I<00:04:42.080> still<00:04:42.440> do<00:04:42.650> have<00:04:42.980> issues<00:04:43.910> with

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
little bit I still do have issues with

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.760 
little bit I still do have issues with
them<00:04:44.180> though<00:04:44.330> but<00:04:44.630> other<00:04:45.200> than<00:04:45.470> that<00:04:45.620> I've

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
them though but other than that I've

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.500 
them though but other than that I've
been<00:04:45.800> doing<00:04:45.950> pretty<00:04:46.760> decent<00:04:47.210> at<00:04:47.270> them<00:04:47.390> though

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
been doing pretty decent at them though

00:04:47.510 --> 00:05:20.720 
been doing pretty decent at them though
so<00:04:47.780> I<00:04:47.840> mean<00:04:48.020> I<00:04:48.200> guess<00:04:48.680> that's<00:04:49.040> a<00:04:49.100> plus

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:20.730 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.280 

don't<00:05:21.480> really<00:05:21.660> want<00:05:21.810> to<00:05:21.870> actually<00:05:22.080> pick<00:05:22.200> up

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
don't really want to actually pick up

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.260 
don't really want to actually pick up
that<00:05:22.470> small<00:05:22.800> walk<00:05:23.400> I'll<00:05:23.670> probably<00:05:23.850> leave<00:05:24.120> it

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
that small walk I'll probably leave it

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.590 
that small walk I'll probably leave it
here<00:05:24.420> for<00:05:24.780> the<00:05:25.140> wood<00:05:25.440> chipper<00:05:26.600> probably

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
here for the wood chipper probably

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.820 
here for the wood chipper probably
really<00:05:27.780> not<00:05:27.930> actually<00:05:28.290> worth<00:05:28.440> anything<00:05:28.650> at

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
really not actually worth anything at

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.160
