00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
two years ago of this room and it really

two years ago of this room and it really
hasn't<00:00:27.840> changed<00:00:28.500> too<00:00:28.830> much

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
hasn't changed too much

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.299 
hasn't changed too much
now<00:00:29.519> that<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.150> twins<00:00:30.480> are<00:00:30.779> toddlers<00:00:31.529> we<00:00:32.099> had

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
now that the twins are toddlers we had

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.180 
now that the twins are toddlers we had
yet<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:33.030> transition<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.899> toddler<00:00:34.410> bed<00:00:34.590> my

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
yet to transition to a toddler bed my

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.479 
yet to transition to a toddler bed my
philosophy<00:00:35.760> on<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.420> wait<00:00:36.600> as<00:00:36.809> long<00:00:37.140> as

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
philosophy on that is to wait as long as

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.600 
philosophy on that is to wait as long as
possible<00:00:38.489> until<00:00:39.390> they<00:00:39.840> begin<00:00:40.250> climbing<00:00:41.250> out

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
possible until they begin climbing out

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.150 
possible until they begin climbing out
of<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.420> crib<00:00:42.780> because<00:00:43.440> especially<00:00:43.860> with

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
of the crib because especially with

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.400 
of the crib because especially with
twins<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.640> just<00:00:45.120> don't<00:00:45.360> know<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.840> want<00:00:46.200> to

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410
