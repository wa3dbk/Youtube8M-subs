00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
when I put them probably in a bun so

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.740 
when I put them probably in a bun so

braid<00:01:43.020> all<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.290> way<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.770> end

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.170 

and<00:01:48.910> braid<00:01:49.780> all<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:50.710> way<00:01:50.860> down<00:01:51.130> as<00:01:51.580> far<00:01:51.910> as<00:01:52.060> you

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
and braid all the way down as far as you

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.950

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
but I get to the end this is probably an

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.910 
but I get to the end this is probably an
unnecessary<00:01:56.600> step<00:01:56.930> but<00:01:57.080> I'm<00:01:57.170> doing<00:01:57.380> it<00:01:57.530> anyway

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
unnecessary step but I'm doing it anyway

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.450 
unnecessary step but I'm doing it anyway
I<00:01:58.159> take<00:01:58.670> a<00:01:58.700> little<00:01:58.970> tiny<00:01:59.299> black<00:01:59.630> rubber<00:01:59.960> band

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
and I just put it right at the end I

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.630 
and I just put it right at the end I
pull<00:02:04.220> it<00:02:04.340> as<00:02:04.430> low<00:02:04.640> as<00:02:04.790> I<00:02:04.909> can<00:02:06.369> so<00:02:07.369> there<00:02:07.520> you
