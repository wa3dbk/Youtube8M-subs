00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.140
 the first of four play 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.940
 home in hagen has the 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.750
 basketball national team of ladies 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.730
 lost to Montenegro lost the 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.990
 team of national coach alexandra maerz 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.520
 with 48 to 60 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.310
 that player for germany 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.110
 promising the first started 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.560
 There were points right at the beginning 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.640
 won tip-off lisa koop scored 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.900
 the 2 0 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.900
 already in the first attempt 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.399
 romy bear the most successful german 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.070
 protect this further this evening 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:44.239
 follow points 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:46.250
 at first she took advantage of downtown and 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.400
 worked out her next hit 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.400
 short time later among the places 12 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.379
 to seven it was after six minutes under 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.970
 level took the first time out 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:01.300
 with consequences for the game 1 11 10 0 run 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.339
 brought the guests in the lead 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.710
 jay murphy the naturalized us 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.229
 american woman with double o mba experience 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.179
 showed all her class and took over 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.640
 more and more control over that 

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:15.410
 game 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.910
 sonja greinacher then for germany 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.610
 after a nice touch of svenja 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.580
 brunckhorst successful after ten 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.509
 minutes was the dbb team with 16 20 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.640
 back but also the second quarter 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.740
 controlled the guests from Montenegro 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.400
 as always to simple points 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.960
 came 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.720
 The team of Alex Maerz had to oppose 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.090
 for every counter work by carmen the 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:45.130
 offensive rarely to beautiful actions 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.360
 as here by anne broader also 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.380
 if you had a bit of those things 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.840
 We did not like it. We have good 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.940
 unlocked and a bit lucky 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.280
 we have been missing good I defended times 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.120
 with 60 points against Montenegro 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.090
 I do not think so bad that you 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.620
 that just just make a little more 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.650
 luck in the end and then it will 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.120
 problematic also the ball losses the 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.610
 The German team in this 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.530
 phase increasingly mastered which caused the 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:13.930
 opponents came to easy points 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:18.000
 lying here by shane murphy 26 to 34 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.000
 the dbb team back at half past time 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.569
 After the page change saw the round 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.640
 800 spectators in the hagener enervie 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.930
 arena then better first 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.780
 performance of your team 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.800
 four minutes were played and 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.350
 Germany , he has the residue something 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.060
 the turn can shorten but wanted 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.980
 not definitively located 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.470
 Montenegro had the right answer 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.390
 ready to play one 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.250
 ten-point lead to the end of 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.540
 Third quarter was not a good game 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.530
 continue from us over long distances 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.150
 we did a bit too much 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.380
 let what you want and were in the 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.760
 she can be as determined as we are 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.190
 that were actually still in Montenegro 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.250
 that same determination was missing 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.450
 at the beginning of the last game section 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.470
 montenegro got one 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.980
 comfortable lead after 35 minutes 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:08.050
 the preliminary decision had already been made 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.920
 36 49 was already the German team 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.260
 back 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.660
 Although the ladies came to worth seeing 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.450
 first meet by a broader 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.330
 and shortly thereafter by svenja brunckhorst 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.459
 Once again, it was there 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.239
 already too late for a serious 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.239
 camberg 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.400
 With 48 to 60 loses Germany against 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.110
 Montenegro 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.390
 nevertheless, romy bear and alexandra are watching 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.790
 Maerz optimistic and combative 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.099
 the next encounters in the small 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.670
 and maybe 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:41.140
 Of course, the disappointment is now 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.209
 big but i believe that we are there too 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.500
 get up and continue with the 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.969
 to tackle mutation we have from 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.010
 said in advance that the montenegro 

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:49.480
 favorite in this group is if the 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.709
 Of course, Ukraine is also very strong 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.359
 is that you can see now synonymous s.den 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.319
 the results against finland I mean 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:54.489
 we have to go to the next four now 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:54.909
 Games win for another chance 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.170
 to have 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:57.670
 that would be a mistake to say that now 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.920
 Things have gone but we have to 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.420
 of course now that we see that 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.230
 we put everything in these gimmicks and 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.239
 stay in the race 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.609
 we still have to work in straight 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.139
 the offensive is not always smooth 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:09.250
 and there we have the next days off 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:11.819
 work and then it looks different 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.819
 and Sunday
