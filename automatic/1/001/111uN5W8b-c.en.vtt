00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.800
 it may be inconvenient to shoot here so we 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.560
 we are in a small room 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:24.269
 This is an attic room on the 2nd floor of ours. 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:31.230
 home bathroom bathroom which takes 8 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:35.370
 square meters of course if we 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.290
 look at the weight then we will see that 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.190
 we have a standard ditch narrow profile hundred 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:46.800
 twelve millimeter panel ride and 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:49.160
 two millimeter material which is like 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.579
 what would we do here we do here 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:56.699
 observe our principle is noise insulation 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.280
 and thermal insulation material difference then 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.190
 there is according to our data 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.670
 2 millimeters of ruberoid if its 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.500
 to properly align noise insulation 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.950
 replaces approximately 5 centimeters from and 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.020
 threshold more accurately looks like this 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.530
 that is, this moment we will have 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.479
 bathroom that takes a shower for 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.189
 this wall we have one bedroom for this 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.680
 we have a hall wall and we do 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.409
 maximum noise isolation with one 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.259
 sides it will be a ruberoid and 10 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.509
 centimeters we will have ecowool which 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.689
 inflated under pressure and does not leave 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:39.090
 no pores for passage of any 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:40.710
 Noises on different we mount roofing felt and it 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.320
 so insulation b is like 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.030
 additional waterproofing common pie 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.520
 will highlight so top we 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.890
 screw the class 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.869
 Drywall 12 millimeters heat resistant 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.420
 because after all in s.b. 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.649
 although not very combustible material 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:01.049
 roofing material is uniquely flammable material. 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:03.780
 gypsum board heat resistance will give us 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:08.910
 which is 1900 degrees the pressure of fire and 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.619
 burning 30 minutes on top of heat resistant 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.760
 as we are in the wet 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:17.670
 indoors we will make her bathroom 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.020
 the main delirium so protect from 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.550
 moisture-proof 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.440
 we will additionally apply the slab 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:27.300
 waterproofing is likely to be 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.860
 moped and put cafe cafe and noise 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.879
 Of course we work with additional 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.180
 materials to 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:37.430
 moisture we had no such chance to pass 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.430
 so we will have walls
