00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.759
 you are well so today we are 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.899
 Monday and as usual it's me so 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.580
 I will start immediately with the 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.500
 question this week which was from 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.480
 you well it's not about actually 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.340
 but you had to show the pair 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.199
 has the most right now so I 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.090
 will avoid showing you but eternal 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.220
 free run because in addition right now 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.930
 I read more wear but he shoes 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.570
 that I really wear a lot in this 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.890
 moment these are these so they are 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.289
 like that 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.150
 and so it's up to date boots and that 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.540
 I bought on the site thank you galls 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:37.140
 dot com is actually it delivers in France 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.790
 I did not know and I paid them 70 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.190
 euros and they are leather so that's it 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.370
 they are like that the talent he makes to 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.500
 about 7 8 cm and they are leather 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.719
 so here are some shoes that I 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.370
 door going past days of 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.180
 stiletto heels or anything so 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.500
 I think it's ok 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.660
 so that's the question of this 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.280
 week for the theme you had to 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.750
 to do exactly an outfit of the day then 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.750
 I will make you the outfit I want 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.340
