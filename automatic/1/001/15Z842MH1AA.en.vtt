00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:12.019
 many animals are learning to live 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.019
 in urban areas 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:19.320
 one of these animals is the visit of bad 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:25.200
 is the omen and course atm or owl 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:27.750
 Burrowing some beliefs say it 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.570
 She's a companion to witches. 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.690
 others believe that it symbolizes the 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.449
 wisdom of the goddess athena in greece 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.429
 old 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:41.999
 despite being a bird surrounded by 

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:44.629
 mysticism science can say that this 

00:00:41.999 --> 00:00:47.960
 species is one of the most 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.960
 of the world 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:01:00.210
 your scream really is not appreciated as 

00:00:56.429 --> 00:01:03.389
 the songbirds but the owl owns 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:08.219
 vision and hearing sharper than 

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:11.570
 other birds in Brazil are identified 

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:15.659
 about 20 species of owls 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:18.840
 as the power in the owls 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.719
 most of the time they eat prey 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.780
 and the parts of the company that do not 

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:27.469
 are requested in the form of 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.469
 balls 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.509
 This is a ball. 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.030
 in it the researchers find many 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.869
 information on eating habits 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.229
 of them and even the types of animals 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.229
 existing in the region 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:54.230
 in this pellet we find by ex or 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:02:01.610
 skeletons of invertebrate seeds and 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:05.480
 bones of small vertebrates other 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:09.830
 Curiosities about owls are the 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:12.710
 ability to turn the head 180 degrees and 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:17.030
 times 270 degrees 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:22.630
 they live on average 15 to 20 years and are 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.630
 prey of hawk snakes and wild cats
