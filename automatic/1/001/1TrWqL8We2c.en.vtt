00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
believe so I knew we had a chance if we

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.240 
believe so I knew we had a chance if we
could<00:01:58.330> if<00:01:59.050> we<00:01:59.110> could<00:01:59.229> double<00:01:59.650> and<00:01:59.800> fight<00:02:00.040> and

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
could if we could double and fight and

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.060 
could if we could double and fight and
keep<00:02:00.460> modest<00:02:00.910> and<00:02:01.740> fortunately<00:02:02.740> I<00:02:02.770> threw<00:02:03.009> the

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
keep modest and fortunately I threw the

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.550 
keep modest and fortunately I threw the

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
first one and Tomas to it a decent shot

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.870
