how I was able to finally get this thing
to<00:03:14.709> work<00:03:14.739> then<00:03:15.099> we<00:03:15.220> take<00:03:15.340> our<00:03:15.519> patron<00:03:15.819> bottle

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
to work then we take our patron bottle

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.750 
to work then we take our patron bottle
and<00:03:16.299> see<00:03:16.720> what<00:03:16.930> happens<00:03:17.470> danger<00:03:18.129> zone

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
and see what happens danger zone

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.640 
and see what happens danger zone
once<00:03:19.239> the<00:03:19.360> pedro'<00:03:19.660> bottle<00:03:19.989> is<00:03:20.079> being<00:03:20.290> lowered

which causes an explosion which super

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.129 
which causes an explosion which super
heats<00:03:42.400> the<00:03:42.609> inside<00:03:44.730> which<00:03:45.730> then<00:03:46.000> drains<00:03:46.420> all

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:47.139 
heats the inside which then drains all
