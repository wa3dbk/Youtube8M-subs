there<00:00:25.160> I<00:00:25.189> illuminate<00:00:25.810> another<00:00:26.810> access<00:00:27.289> paint

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
there I illuminate another access paint

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:29.950 
there I illuminate another access paint
point<00:00:27.949> that's<00:00:28.189> where<00:00:28.400> the<00:00:28.490> old<00:00:28.609> TV<00:00:28.960> antenna

point that's where the old TV antenna

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.740 
point that's where the old TV antenna
hooked<00:00:30.230> up<00:00:30.789> just<00:00:31.789> that<00:00:32.329> was<00:00:32.449> with<00:00:32.599> the

access again this trailer is going to be
off<00:00:58.370> grid<00:00:58.730> so<00:00:59.690> I<00:01:00.019> silicone<00:01:00.739> and<00:01:01.100> taped<00:01:01.370> it<00:01:01.519> off

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
off grid so I silicone and taped it off

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.389 
off grid so I silicone and taped it off
just<00:01:02.840> to<00:01:02.989> make<00:01:03.140> sure<00:01:03.170> this<00:01:03.469> will<00:01:03.620> never<00:01:03.800> leak

00:01:06.389 --> 00:01:06.399 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.770 

there's<00:01:07.399> a<00:01:07.429> fridge<00:01:07.729> vent<00:01:07.970> for<00:01:08.149> the<00:01:08.210> winter<00:01:08.570> I

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
there's a fridge vent for the winter I

there's a fridge vent for the winter I
mentioned<00:01:09.649> on<00:01:09.710> my<00:01:09.740> website<00:01:10.250> how<00:01:10.460> I<00:01:10.490> tape<00:01:10.789> it

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
mentioned on my website how I tape it

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.430 
mentioned on my website how I tape it
off<00:01:11.090> along<00:01:11.330> the<00:01:11.390> edges<00:01:11.840> to<00:01:11.869> make<00:01:12.110> sure<00:01:12.170> no

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
off along the edges to make sure no

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.580 
off along the edges to make sure no
water<00:01:12.649> comes<00:01:12.920> in<00:01:13.130> now<00:01:14.119> you<00:01:14.300> can<00:01:14.420> see<00:01:14.660> it's

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
water comes in now you can see it's

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.139 
water comes in now you can see it's
temporary<00:01:16.009> you<00:01:16.100> can<00:01:16.250> slice<00:01:16.490> it<00:01:16.700> open<00:01:16.729> you<00:01:17.030> can

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
temporary you can slice it open you can

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:18.969 
temporary you can slice it open you can
peel<00:01:17.330> it<00:01:17.390> off<00:01:17.660> but<00:01:18.229> it<00:01:18.350> does<00:01:18.500> a<00:01:18.530> very<00:01:18.619> good<00:01:18.920> job

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979
