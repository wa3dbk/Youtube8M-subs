 brand Aileen in his time was 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.650
 trendsetter on gaming laptops 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.840
 Today the situation has changed a little 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.640
 rivet gaming laptops have taken everything 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:21.769
 who is not lazy to get ahead 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:24.439
 have to work our sweat 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:27.019
 the next review 13-inch laptop d l 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.970
 ln in today is the most compact 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:31.939
 model line of the company that came 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.039
 replacing the 11 inch laptop m11x 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:37.149
 the last modification of which came out already 

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:37.149
 4 years ago 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.640
 externally helen I would be 13 continues glorious 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.440
 design traditions of the company on 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.480
 alien artifact laptop look like 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.489
 weakly from other laptops 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.309
 manufacturers are different and pretty 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.530
 not much confuse even the blind way not 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.879
 prank joking talking about laptop color this 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.399
 not some kind of sulfur 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.379
 epic silver yes and this is one of 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.570
 the thinnest and lightest gaming laptops 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.060
 to date material 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.210
 manufacturing conventional earth at any 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:10.340
 nab tanya tiberium or kryptonite just 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.600
 good plastic they even say that 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.430
 carbon fiber 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.340
 there is a vague suspicion that the top 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.410
 panel can be resistant to scratching 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.770
 excellent build quality inside and Kovalenko 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.660
 works perfectly 13-inch will not force 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.730
 its owner is redder and open 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.710
 no cheap gloss 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.560
 matte screen has good viewing angles 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.810
 and color reproduction but not the highest 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.740
 brightness on the lawn in the park you will 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.439
 inconvenience 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.960
 ellen you a13 is equipped with excellent gaming 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:43.030
 Klava it concerns and sizes and course 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.520
 keys touchpad world too ershov 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.020
 and also the world is responsive soft-touch plastic 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.590
 under the palms slowly but surely 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:53.020
 stained be alert and 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.360
 like any other alien guest 13 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.520
 don't shy away exquisitely illuminated through 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.320
 command center color can be customized 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.049
 Modes for the four zones on the keyboard 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.479
 highlighting the inclusion of buttons and indicators 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.610
 also logos under the screen and on the cover 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.799
 laptop 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.630
 engineer lng surely believe bright 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:13.330
 wireless future but not 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.940
 forget about the physical ports here 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.880
 there are all three there are by 30 audio input and 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.220
 output lan connector hdmi and displayport and 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.739
 graphics accelerator connector graph 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.299
 amplifier 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.670
 built-in speakers from klipsch posted 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:29.920
 on the sides sound good but on the volume 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.110
 close to maximal wheeze 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.970
 two fans are visible below the grill 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.830
 looking ahead we say that with the problem 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.040
 heat sink developers coped 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.350
 Great for especially curious under removable 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.579
 cover slot for RAM and playground 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.900
 under hard drive or ssd 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:49.000
 entrails elen would they contain 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.190
 no photon quantum solvers 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.470
 converters and line processors 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.060
 only silicon and rarely land 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.190
 items worth noting that 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.750
 game developers each 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.030
 since I have to decide almost 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.890
 philosophical task what to put on 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.260
 first place mobility or 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.930
 performance in the case of ellen you 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.940
 a13 engineers clearly chose the first 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.950
 installing an economical dual-core 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.989
 processor capability 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.350
 laptop video cards will do an excellent job 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:19.150
 games of the season 2013 2014 by pulls 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.109
 Full hd picture with high settings 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.359
 qualities 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:24.430
 but for from the word voracious toys from 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:26.390
 alas 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.790
 refuse 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.680
 notice that we tested ellen you are a13 in 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.170
 basic configurations are also available 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:37.220
 options with a processor core i7 5500 you 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:39.290
 gtx 960m graphics with 16 gigabytes of RAM 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.830
 touch screen full hd and 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.750
 terabyte solid state drive what 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.820
 As for autonomy, the system 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.200
 shows good performance from 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.090
 two to three hours at maximum 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:04:08.120
 load up to five to six to view 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:04:10.430
 video and daily tasks and a few words 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.910
 Helene about the schedule and m bluff 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.739
 monstrously in the form of an accelerator contains 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.390
 460 cotton power supply system 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.549
 cooling adapters 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.230
 connector for a desktop video card can 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.740
 use something like nvidia 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:27.050
 geforce gtx 980 and module with four of 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.880
 department 30 as vdl claims 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.860
 pripyat in some games 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.350
 able to double the frame rate when 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.360
 highest settings in general 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.760
 this solution is unique but has a number 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.830
 restrictions on used video cards 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:43.780
 and also not cheap to sweep off the shelves 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.780
 its stores will not be exactly 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.680
 modern gaming laptop like we already 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.810
 said it is always a compromise to find 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.030
 mobile solution that will be a long time 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.950
 playing and super productive not 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.320
 get even plump 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.690
 purses compact pleasing to the eye and 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.120
 helen you I 13 will raise his self-esteem 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.950
 there is no doubt about the owner, but with something 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:09.630
 exceptional as it turned out this 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:11.220
 laptop is not subscribe to 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.160
 channel geek aces pile leave 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:17.240
 comment put huskies and do not forget 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.240
 the future of our hands
