Oh guys home to the craft beer Channel
and<00:00:09.460> Merry<00:00:09.670> Christmas<00:00:09.990> today<00:00:10.990> we're<00:00:11.290> getting

and Merry Christmas today we're getting
a<00:00:11.530> bit<00:00:11.650> experimental<00:00:12.430> with<00:00:13.090> our<00:00:13.210> mulling<00:00:13.540> I'm

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:13.660 
a bit experimental with our mulling I'm

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.419 
a bit experimental with our mulling I'm
here<00:00:13.840> with<00:00:13.960> Steve<00:00:14.200> and<00:00:14.470> today<00:00:14.920> we're<00:00:15.250> going<00:00:15.340> to

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:15.429 
here with Steve and today we're going to

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:18.060 
here with Steve and today we're going to
be<00:00:15.519> doing<00:00:15.670> a<00:00:16.059> Creek<00:00:16.930> which<00:00:17.410> is<00:00:17.529> the<00:00:17.619> lamb<00:00:17.830> bits

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.070 
be doing a Creek which is the lamb bits

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.900 
be doing a Creek which is the lamb bits
from<00:00:18.310> Belgium<00:00:18.900> cherry<00:00:19.900> beer<00:00:20.670> slightly<00:00:21.670> sour

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910 
from Belgium cherry beer slightly sour

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.000 
from Belgium cherry beer slightly sour
may<00:00:22.539> be<00:00:22.600> wild<00:00:23.080> yeasts<00:00:23.440> there's<00:00:23.619> a<00:00:23.680> little<00:00:23.890> bit

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.010 
may be wild yeasts there's a little bit

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.519 
may be wild yeasts there's a little bit
a<00:00:24.220> little<00:00:24.520> bit<00:00:24.640> wild<00:00:25.029> basically<00:00:25.779> so<00:00:26.380> this<00:00:26.439> is

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:26.529 
a little bit wild basically so this is

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:27.720 
a little bit wild basically so this is
gonna<00:00:26.650> be<00:00:26.770> really<00:00:26.890> sour<00:00:27.130> how<00:00:27.400> are<00:00:27.460> we<00:00:27.550> going<00:00:27.670> to

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
gonna be really sour how are we going to

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.519 
gonna be really sour how are we going to
counteract<00:00:28.359> that<00:00:28.449> and<00:00:28.720> make<00:00:28.960> sure<00:00:29.109> we<00:00:29.289> end<00:00:29.410> up

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:29.529 
counteract that and make sure we end up

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.560 
counteract that and make sure we end up
with<00:00:29.650> a<00:00:29.680> really<00:00:30.310> drinkable<00:00:30.789> malt

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
with a really drinkable malt

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.360 
with a really drinkable malt
well<00:00:32.199> I<00:00:32.439> think<00:00:32.559> what<00:00:32.769> we're<00:00:32.860> gonna<00:00:32.980> have<00:00:33.070> to<00:00:33.220> do

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
well I think what we're gonna have to do

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.390 
well I think what we're gonna have to do
is<00:00:33.640> is<00:00:33.910> use<00:00:34.239> something<00:00:35.050> sweet<00:00:35.350> we've<00:00:35.860> also<00:00:36.100> got

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.400 
is is use something sweet we've also got

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.030 
is is use something sweet we've also got
some<00:00:36.430> some<00:00:37.330> fruit<00:00:37.659> so<00:00:37.900> it<00:00:38.409> could<00:00:38.650> be<00:00:38.680> that<00:00:38.830> what

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
some some fruit so it could be that what

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.670 
some some fruit so it could be that what
we<00:00:39.129> can<00:00:39.250> do<00:00:39.400> is<00:00:39.519> is<00:00:39.699> get<00:00:39.940> a<00:00:39.970> little<00:00:40.120> bit<00:00:40.269> of

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
we can do is is get a little bit of

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.200 
we can do is is get a little bit of
juice<00:00:41.680> in<00:00:41.860> there<00:00:42.010> as<00:00:42.159> well<00:00:42.339> and<00:00:42.519> just<00:00:43.059> see<00:00:43.150> if

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
juice in there as well and just see if

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.630 
juice in there as well and just see if
we<00:00:43.269> can<00:00:43.360> counteract<00:00:43.839> that<00:00:44.309> but<00:00:45.309> I<00:00:45.339> think<00:00:45.580> the

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
we can counteract that but I think the

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.979 
we can counteract that but I think the
soundness<00:00:45.909> itself<00:00:46.390> we<00:00:46.570> you<00:00:46.780> know<00:00:46.870> we<00:00:46.930> don't

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
soundness itself we you know we don't

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:48.149 
soundness itself we you know we don't
want<00:00:47.170> to<00:00:47.199> go<00:00:47.290> too<00:00:47.350> far<00:00:47.710> because<00:00:47.799> on<00:00:47.979> that's

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:48.159 
want to go too far because on that's

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:48.990 
want to go too far because on that's
going<00:00:48.280> to<00:00:48.339> give<00:00:48.460> it<00:00:48.549> quite<00:00:48.640> an<00:00:48.790> interesting

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:22.109 
we're going to get a quite a nice sort
of<00:01:20.439> warm<00:01:20.710> character<00:01:21.280> out<00:01:21.429> of<00:01:21.549> this<00:01:21.670> some<00:01:21.880> I'm

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
of warm character out of this some I'm

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:23.910 
of warm character out of this some I'm
hoping<00:01:22.630> so<00:01:23.200> we'll<00:01:23.350> put<00:01:23.500> some<00:01:23.619> of<00:01:23.649> that<00:01:23.740> in

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
hoping so we'll put some of that in

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.429 
hoping so we'll put some of that in
there<00:01:24.090> we're<00:01:25.090> going<00:01:25.240> to<00:01:25.299> put<00:01:25.840> in<00:01:25.929> some<00:01:26.200> of<00:01:26.229> this

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
there we're going to put in some of this

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:29.429 
there we're going to put in some of this
so<00:01:27.100> we'll<00:01:27.250> put<00:01:27.429> in<00:01:27.520> some<00:01:27.670> zest<00:01:27.969> I<00:01:28.179> think<00:01:28.439> just

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
so we'll put in some zest I think just

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:32.160 
so we'll put in some zest I think just
initially<00:01:29.890> and<00:01:30.880> then<00:01:31.390> I<00:01:31.420> think<00:01:31.840> what<00:01:32.049> we'll

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
initially and then I think what we'll

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.489 
initially and then I think what we'll
try<00:01:32.409> and<00:01:32.590> do<00:01:32.710> is<00:01:33.009> just<00:01:33.969> add<00:01:34.359> a<00:01:34.420> little<00:01:34.630> bit<00:01:34.780> of<00:01:34.960> a

00:01:35.489 --> 00:01:35.499 
try and do is just add a little bit of a

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:38.840 
try and do is just add a little bit of a
little<00:01:36.249> bit<00:01:36.340> of<00:01:36.429> juice<00:01:36.640> in<00:01:36.820> there<00:01:36.969> as<00:01:37.119> well<00:01:37.299> so

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
little bit of juice in there as well so

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.749 
little bit of juice in there as well so
nice<00:01:39.850> and<00:01:40.030> juicy<00:01:40.270> just<00:01:41.219> add<00:01:42.219> a<00:01:42.249> little<00:01:42.490> bit<00:01:42.609> of

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
nice and juicy just add a little bit of

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.760 
nice and juicy just add a little bit of
that<00:01:42.850> -<00:01:43.590> lovely

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
that - lovely

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.260 
that - lovely
then<00:01:45.670> we<00:01:45.999> have<00:01:46.240> here<00:01:46.509> some<00:01:46.950> cloves<00:01:48.270> somewhere

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
then we have here some cloves somewhere

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.830 
then we have here some cloves somewhere
there<00:01:49.450> we<00:01:49.509> go

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
there we go

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.469 
there we go
so<00:01:50.380> we'll<00:01:50.499> put<00:01:50.649> some<00:01:50.679> cloves<00:01:51.100> in<00:01:51.280> again<00:01:51.880> very

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
so we'll put some cloves in again very

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.739 
so we'll put some cloves in again very
sort<00:01:52.689> of<00:01:52.719> traditional<00:01:53.200> last<00:01:54.039> but<00:01:54.219> not<00:01:54.369> least

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:54.749 
sort of traditional last but not least

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:58.380 
sort of traditional last but not least
let's<00:01:55.749> pop<00:01:56.439> in<00:01:56.590> another<00:01:56.799> little<00:01:57.069> a<00:01:57.609> little<00:01:58.299> bit
