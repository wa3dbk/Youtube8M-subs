00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
i have 816 kills playing some domination

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.690 
i have 816 kills playing some domination
on<00:00:06.299> the<00:00:06.450> map<00:00:06.629> raid<00:00:06.990> i'm<00:00:07.830> using<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.189> an-94

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
on the map raid i'm using the an-94

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.879 
on the map raid i'm using the an-94
assault<00:00:09.240> rifle<00:00:09.570> if<00:00:10.170> you<00:00:10.290> guys<00:00:10.440> are<00:00:10.710> familiar

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
assault rifle if you guys are familiar

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.379 
assault rifle if you guys are familiar
with<00:00:11.190> this<00:00:11.400> gun<00:00:11.610> it's<00:00:11.790> actually<00:00:12.090> really<00:00:12.269> good

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
with this gun it's actually really good

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.020 
with this gun it's actually really good
i<00:00:12.719> believe<00:00:13.019> it's<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.349> last<00:00:13.730> unlocked<00:00:14.730> for

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
i believe it's the last unlocked for

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.120 
i believe it's the last unlocked for
assault<00:00:15.299> rifles<00:00:15.660> so<00:00:16.410> i<00:00:16.440> guess<00:00:16.710> it's<00:00:16.890> kind<00:00:17.100> of

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
assault rifles so i guess it's kind of

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.710 
assault rifles so i guess it's kind of
hard<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.369> get<00:00:17.580> if<00:00:17.789> you're<00:00:17.910> new<00:00:18.060> at<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.270> game<00:00:18.300> or

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
hard to get if you're new at the game or

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.870 
hard to get if you're new at the game or
if<00:00:18.810> you<00:00:18.900> just<00:00:18.930> got<00:00:19.289> it<00:00:19.320> but<00:00:19.980> once<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:20.609> unlock

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
if you just got it but once you unlock

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.340 
if you just got it but once you unlock

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
bit more defensive do so um once you

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.880 
bit more defensive do so um once you
call<00:01:03.210> in<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.390> black<00:01:03.629> bird<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.409> new<00:01:04.619> point
