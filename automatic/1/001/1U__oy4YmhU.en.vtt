00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:16.410
 I am Eric Martin Assistant to 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.840
 Philippe decouflaged on panorama is so 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.539
 on the panoramas project he has me all 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.529
 immediately asked to follow him in this 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:28.170
 re creation process since I have 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.429
 crossed for 11 years all 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.270
 Philippe's pieces torn in 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.340
 starting with triton until shazam ses 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.129
 11 years old was still a 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.790
 big part of the history of 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.520
 the company dc Ã  l'envi de philippe 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:49.200
 disguised to go back practically 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.719
 30 years of plays it was two in great 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.480
 part of showing the work of the 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.410
 company for younger generations of 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.520
 under 20 years old philippe wants that 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.539
 his dancers are multidisciplinary 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.880
 that is, they are not 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.500
 only dancers but whose 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.049
 opportunity to sing to play the 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.189
 comedy to play an instrument of 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.189
 play the clown 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.750
 they are very very physical pieces 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.810
 the limit of acrobatics and so he 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.540
 wanted his dancers to be at their best 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.230
 of their form to be able to restore these 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.230
 choreographic writing 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.409
 in panorama we find most of 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:34.569
 ingredients found in all 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.450
 philippe parts ie the 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:41.289
 flights the dances graphic and dance 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:45.369
 humorous and then well of the field and 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:47.289
 then comedy everything is sectioned 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.609
 fragmented but at the same time it is 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.159
 built a bit like an exquisite corpse 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:55.149
 that is, a dance a color 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:57.429
 will call another Libyan girl from 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.020
 this generation where he wanted to break 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:01.119
 the codes of contemporary dance 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.879
 that he found precisely very serious 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.549
 that's why the figure of the 

00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:08.610
 loyal gentleman came very early and 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:11.290
 and sir the nothing is not elsewhere 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.739
 he's not just there like 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:17.190
 character who will bring humor 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.900
 but he's also here as a dancer 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.099
 he absolutely wants to find 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.040
 the wonder he always has 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:26.049
 felt when he was a child and that he 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.680
 was going to see the circus shows 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:33.360
 so this entertainment side there is 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.100
 important to him but giving a 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.650
 maybe a whole other value to 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:41.490
 Circus entertainment is it's light 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.130
 at the same time it's built it's not 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.480
 free 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.300
 it's more than a dance show 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.240
 here I am silent to say more and the 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:54.720
 cd the viewer and discover but it's 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:57.420
 true that the month the greatest pleasure 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.100
 when I attend each treatment at the show 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.820
 it's to see people smile the end of 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:05.010
 show and go out happy with a 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.380
 big smile one as well at the 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.740
 smaller than in adults and among 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.900
 people over 70 years old this is 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.170
 the same smile and that's a real 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.170
 happiness
