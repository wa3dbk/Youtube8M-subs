three<00:00:18.900> flash<00:00:19.170> okay<00:00:19.890> so<00:00:20.430> what<00:00:20.580> we're<00:00:20.670> going<00:00:20.789> to

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
three flash okay so what we're going to

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.820 
three flash okay so what we're going to
do<00:00:21.000> what<00:00:21.689> we're<00:00:21.810> going<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.020> do<00:00:22.170> for<00:00:22.410> us<00:00:22.439> first

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
do what we're going to do for us first

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.679 
do what we're going to do for us first
we<00:00:22.980> need<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.279> set<00:00:23.490> up<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.970> channel<00:00:24.300> on<00:00:24.630> our

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
we need to set up a channel on our

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.099 
we need to set up a channel on our
transmitter<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:26.490> let's<00:00:27.390> suppose<00:00:27.539> if<00:00:27.840> you<00:00:27.960> look

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
transmitter so let's suppose if you look

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.290 
transmitter so let's suppose if you look
at<00:00:28.260> this<00:00:28.439> one<00:00:28.650> right<00:00:28.859> here<00:00:29.460> if<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.849> tips<00:00:30.090> is

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
at this one right here if the tips is

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.990 
at this one right here if the tips is
setting<00:00:30.779> right<00:00:30.990> there<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.679> set<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.669> channel

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
setting right there I set you to channel

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.830 
setting right there I set you to channel
number<00:00:33.270> twelve

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
number twelve

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.560 
number twelve
as<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:34.829> can<00:00:34.950> see<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.460> how<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.030> set<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.540> to

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
as you can see that how I set it to

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.139 
as you can see that how I set it to
number<00:00:36.750> 12<00:00:37.200> because<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.920> know<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:38.820> from

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
number 12 because I know that from

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.650 
number 12 because I know that from
setting<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.110> camp<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.340> flash<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:42.420> it's

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
setting of the camp of the flash so it's

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.459 
setting of the camp of the flash so it's
number<00:00:42.840> 12

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
number 12

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.940 
number 12
so<00:00:43.950> it's<00:00:44.460> this<00:00:44.820> has<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.420> be<00:00:45.539> exactly<00:00:46.320> matching

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
so it's this has to be exactly matching

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.860 
so it's this has to be exactly matching
with<00:00:47.129> your<00:00:47.700> flash<00:00:48.360> camera<00:00:48.930> so<00:00:49.850> just<00:00:50.850> just<00:00:51.360> keep

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
with your flash camera so just just keep

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.729 
with your flash camera so just just keep
a<00:00:52.020> note<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.649> one<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.340> first<00:00:53.879> Ipswich<00:00:54.360> is

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
a note of that one so first Ipswich is

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.910 
a note of that one so first Ipswich is
just<00:00:55.739> on<00:00:56.010> position<00:00:56.780> second<00:00:57.780> one<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.710> off

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
just on position second one to the off

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.420 
just on position second one to the off
position<00:00:59.420> third<00:01:00.420> one<00:01:00.780> on<00:01:00.989> fourth<00:01:01.890> one<00:01:02.190> on

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
position third one on fourth one on

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.670 
position third one on fourth one on
that's<00:01:03.329> exactly<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.019> same<00:01:04.229> we're<00:01:04.409> going<00:01:04.589> to

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
that's exactly the same we're going to

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.330 
that's exactly the same we're going to
do<00:01:04.830> on<00:01:05.250> our<00:01:05.400> flash<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.510> I'll<00:01:06.689> be<00:01:06.900> ok<00:01:07.619> so<00:01:08.250> I'm

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
do on our flash and I'll be ok so I'm

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.719 
do on our flash and I'll be ok so I'm
going<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.549> turn<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.880> off<00:01:09.119> plus<00:01:10.520> I'm<00:01:11.520> going<00:01:11.670> to

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
going to turn that off plus I'm going to

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.090 
going to turn that off plus I'm going to
turn<00:01:11.970> this<00:01:12.119> flashes<00:01:12.689> on<00:01:12.869> now<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:13.890> at<00:01:14.010> the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
turn this flashes on now so at the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.130 
turn this flashes on now so at the
moment<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.490> set<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.880> general<00:01:15.240> but<00:01:15.479> nine<00:01:15.720> as<00:01:16.020> you

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
moment is set to general but nine as you

moment is set to general but nine as you
can<00:01:16.350> see<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.770> channel<00:01:17.040> number<00:01:17.340> nine<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.880> set

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
can see the channel number nine is set
