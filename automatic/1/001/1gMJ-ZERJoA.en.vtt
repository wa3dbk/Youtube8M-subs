00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.470
 hello my name is l'a I have a 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.130
 question to ask yourself 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:19.939
 what is the first living thing that 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.939
 appeared on earth 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:29.189
 it's a very good question lena a 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.040
 very interesting question but also 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.860
 very difficult it is very difficult 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.210
 because the first things alive 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.370
 who appeared on the earth have 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.050
 gone for a long time they have 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.089
 been destroyed they do not have any 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.350
 trace the rocks in which we 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:45.960
 could find them in form 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.760
 fossils have transformed and 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.000
 today is very difficult to 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.979
 find some witnesses traces of 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.350
 this event so important for life 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:57.809
 on the earth and it's also very 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.729
 difficult because this question poses 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.710
 another question that of the 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:02.549
 definition of life what is a 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.949
 living thing 

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:06.570
 the cells that compose us and the 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.310
 first cells that appeared on 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.740
 the earth is alive and well 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.869
 but was there not before others 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.119
 things that could be called 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.370
 alive and so that's a question yet 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.990
 very difficult 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.640
 scientists are interested in this 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.680
 exciting question of the origins of the 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.140
 life the first paleontologists who 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.370
 work on fossil cells 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.800
 that they are trying to find in 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.570
 very old rocks and then there is 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.130
 other scientists who is trying to 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.010
 understand what happened before 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.330
 the appearance of these cells and it is 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.740
 a very interesting to see that that 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.000
 mobilizes scientists very 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.830
 different from the very disciplines 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.260
 different it goes from planetology 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.140
 up to biology going through the 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:49.410
 geology chemistry biochemistry la 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.300
 cell biology microbiology and 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.860
 all these scientists gather their 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.650
 knowledge and tries to build 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.540
 together a scenario that tells the stories 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.040
 origins of life on earth and 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.760
 origins of the steps that preceded 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.740
 the appearance the appearance of the cells 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.120
 it is also inspired by what they can 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.950
 see naturally in nature 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.260
 current all places where there are 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.990
 somewhat unusual conditions that 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.760
 could recall the primitive earth the 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.520
 interest like for example some 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.670
 areas in the center in the middle of the oceans 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.310
 but scientists also arise 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.080
 always the question of the definition of 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.850
 life is one of the bases a lot of 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.070
 this question because some 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.810
 consider that life exists only 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.370
 when cells are formed of others 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.800
 consider that the structures 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.170
 molecular chemical systems 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.480
 complexes that may have existed before 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.660
 cells are already living things 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.340
 so debate between these two these two 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.380
 categories of other scientists 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.850
 consider that this debate is not 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.010
 necessarily useful and that we can all 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.470
 just take into account the 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:56.420
 transformation process of the 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:59.520
 material from the unorganized material 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.040
 to cells like the process 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.290
 which leads to life and so that one 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.100
 can escape this problem from the 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.100
 definition of life
