00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
hey guys what's up it is Bucky and as

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.170 
hey guys what's up it is Bucky and as
you<00:00:03.720> can<00:00:03.870> see<00:00:04.080> I<00:00:04.110> just<00:00:04.350> got<00:00:04.620> my<00:00:04.890> brand<00:00:05.310> new<00:00:05.580> Mac

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
you can see I just got my brand new Mac

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.600 
you can see I just got my brand new Mac
and<00:00:06.480> you<00:00:06.990> know<00:00:07.109> what<00:00:07.200> that<00:00:07.350> means<00:00:07.589> we<00:00:08.460> can

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
and you know what that means we can

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.230 
and you know what that means we can
finally<00:00:08.880> begin<00:00:09.269> programming<00:00:10.019> in<00:00:10.320> Objective<00:00:11.160> C

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:11.240 
finally begin programming in Objective C

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.400 
finally begin programming in Objective C
now<00:00:12.240> if<00:00:12.389> you're<00:00:12.570> watching<00:00:12.690> this<00:00:12.960> store<00:00:13.290> just

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
now if you're watching this store just

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.079 
now if you're watching this store just
cuz<00:00:13.830> you<00:00:13.860> clicked<00:00:14.219> on<00:00:14.309> it<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.549> you're<00:00:14.759> like<00:00:14.910> I

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
cuz you clicked on it and you're like I

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.689 
cuz you clicked on it and you're like I
don't<00:00:15.150> even<00:00:15.420> know<00:00:15.540> what<00:00:15.690> Objective<00:00:16.170> C<00:00:16.199> is

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:16.699 
don't even know what Objective C is

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:19.970 
don't even know what Objective C is
Objective<00:00:17.699> C<00:00:17.730> is<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.420> language<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:19.170> allows

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
Objective C is the language that allows

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.939 
Objective C is the language that allows
you<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.189> develop<00:00:20.900> programs<00:00:21.900> in<00:00:22.199> on<00:00:22.500> not<00:00:22.920> only

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
you to develop programs in on not only

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.150 
you to develop programs in on not only
the<00:00:23.400> Mac<00:00:23.640> itself<00:00:24.210> but<00:00:24.779> also<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.320> iPhone<00:00:25.800> and

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
the Mac itself but also the iPhone and

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.109 
the Mac itself but also the iPhone and
iPod<00:00:26.550> touch

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
iPod touch

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.540 
iPod touch
so<00:00:27.570> that's<00:00:27.869> what<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.080> really<00:00:28.439> care<00:00:28.590> about<00:00:28.650> but

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
so that's what I really care about but

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.669 
so that's what I really care about but
in<00:00:29.820> order<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.269> just<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:31.109> can't<00:00:31.320> really<00:00:31.470> just

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
in order to just you can't really just

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.400 
in order to just you can't really just
jump<00:00:32.009> right<00:00:32.099> into<00:00:32.340> iPod<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.120> iPhone<00:00:33.750> program

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
jump right into iPod and iPhone program

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.770 
jump right into iPod and iPhone program
you<00:00:34.860> got<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.100> learn<00:00:35.250> Objective<00:00:35.940> C<00:00:35.969> in<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.480> core

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
you got to learn Objective C in the core

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.680 
you got to learn Objective C in the core
language<00:00:37.320> behind<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.100> first<00:00:38.340> so<00:00:39.210> that's<00:00:39.480> what

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
language behind it first so that's what

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.970 
language behind it first so that's what
we're<00:00:39.780> going<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:39.930> be<00:00:40.079> doing<00:00:40.230> in<00:00:40.590> this<00:00:40.710> first

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
we're going to be doing in this first

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.680 
we're going to be doing in this first
tutorial<00:00:41.100> we<00:00:42.000> aren't<00:00:42.180> really<00:00:42.300> going<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.629> be

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
tutorial we aren't really going to be

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.540 
tutorial we aren't really going to be
writing<00:00:42.989> any<00:00:43.260> code<00:00:43.559> but<00:00:44.129> we're<00:00:44.280> going<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.430> be

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
writing any code but we're going to be

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.880 
writing any code but we're going to be
setting<00:00:44.940> up<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.239> program<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:46.469> allows<00:00:46.500> you

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
setting up the program that allows you

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.720 
setting up the program that allows you
to<00:00:47.399> write<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.879> code<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:48.809> I'm<00:00:49.680> not<00:00:50.399> sure

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
to write the code so I'm not sure

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.720 
to write the code so I'm not sure
because<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.180> already<00:00:51.750> downloaded<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:53.039> iPhone

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
because I already downloaded the iPhone

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.670 
because I already downloaded the iPhone
SDK<00:00:53.969> which<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.870> program<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.350> make<00:00:55.500> iphone

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
SDK which is the program to make iphone

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.450 
SDK which is the program to make iphone
apps<00:00:55.980> but<00:00:56.879> I'm<00:00:57.090> like<00:00:57.360> 90%<00:00:58.109> sure<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:59.340> the

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
apps but I'm like 90% sure that the

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.610 
apps but I'm like 90% sure that the
program<00:00:59.850> Xcode<00:01:00.600> which<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.230> program<00:01:01.440> that

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
program Xcode which is the program that

this little thing called Xcode at the

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.859 
this little thing called Xcode at the
bottom<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:46.950> go<00:01:47.220> ahead<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.820> well<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.720> can

bottom so go ahead and well you can
double<00:01:49.140> click<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.500> but<00:01:49.829> it's<00:01:49.950> open<00:01:50.100> already

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
exact Objective C so by default they

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.050 
exact Objective C so by default they
already<00:03:34.320> give<00:03:34.590> you<00:03:34.769> a<00:03:34.799> program<00:03:35.549> that's<00:03:35.850> built

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
already give you a program that's built

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.300 
already give you a program that's built
and<00:03:36.360> all<00:03:36.600> that<00:03:36.780> is<00:03:36.930> is<00:03:37.200> it's<00:03:37.530> text<00:03:37.980> on<00:03:38.100> screen

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
rid of the semicolon try to build and

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.340 
rid of the semicolon try to build and
run<00:05:15.360> it<00:05:16.970> make<00:05:17.970> sure<00:05:18.120> you<00:05:18.240> save<00:05:18.480> and<00:05:18.750> it<00:05:19.110> set

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
run it make sure you save and it set

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.080 
run it make sure you save and it set
failed<00:05:19.740> that<00:05:20.310> means<00:05:20.610> that<00:05:20.790> you<00:05:20.880> mess
