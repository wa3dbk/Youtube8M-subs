00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:13.479
 after 

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:16.479
 I was happy an anticipation 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.949
 adverse actions 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:24.159
 by anticipating the pass of two opponents by taking mention 

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:27.259
 a direct opponent 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:29.239
 g 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:31.849
 5 breaks 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:33.920
 m 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.140
 a lot of anticipation 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.140
 become fair race in front of good time 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.420
 imprecise harmful 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.850
 form of pressure on them 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.850
 the direct opponent 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.480
 ing 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.480
 ap 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.040
 for the first time this season but you have to laugh a lot 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.120
 it is necessary 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.270
 run it takes a lot observed% 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.790
 and here at fault-on-the-sea the wives' concert of the opponent 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.280
 course of his colleagues 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.710
 and that's a good position to put his possible positioning is very 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.710
 important site 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.080
 very young I made several breaks-that I have day in defense 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.250
 here I played percent 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.250
 the game a lot of positions in defense 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.360
 defensive features 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.780
 and here we are 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.310
 and then I'm really a meticulous someone a man of god bothering them 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.580
 the duels 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.580
 and let's say yes yes this post 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.680
 characterizes well but kanoutÃ© 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.070
 I'm fine I think I found a job where I blossomed and 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.050
 bush ps help the team to the maximum economy 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.800
 this technique because my goal is to recover% and quickly the 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.260
 balloon as quickly as possible 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.030
 and quickly project the radars ahead of him his share of 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.430
 controls 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.880
 victory 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.430
 by a direct pass including recovering a key found 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.430
 colleagues well placed 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:18.609
 well oriented recovering by guiding the game 

00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:22.709
 enel by expanding the game 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.190
 yes yes sure that term recovery these signs a lot more 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:29.469
 technical and a lot more 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:32.469
 difficult 

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:39.979
 if heels for them 

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:43.829
 yes yes launched high and it's not because we are recuperator for the palm 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.029
 gestures 

00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:48.469
 these little technical gestures that's why 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:51.510
 Whistler's Moses is a beautiful gesture of me 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.109
 it has to be 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:54.779
 the effective too 

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:57.799
 the goal is that it is beautiful but effective if they at the same time 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:01.329
 I especially prefer efficiency to the beauty of the gesture 

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:05.549
 on stage on the spot this accent is obvious 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.659
 it's a nice gesture at the same time that allowed us to recover the 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:11.659
 balloon and 

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:20.269
 I go where is the motivation the rigor 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.949
 durfy is back is beefier 

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:26.739
 and sometimes you have to tap the book on the table to be able to continue all the 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:27.939
 world 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:30.939
 that's what allows us to 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.639
 we reconcentrate ourselves and that's also my role too 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:37.919
 when the team is 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:39.849
 the most lax of 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:42.849
 do not let go of the pressure of 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:47.019
 not 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.019

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.579

00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:00.249
 I do not score much nova to be entitled to a lawyer the footballer 

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:02.810
 nine of you the bourgeois 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.889
 here I am taking a risk years 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:07.589
 we lose the dr lost 3 years 

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:10.839
 I have more risk taking I have tried my luck in my life 

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:14.329
 we come back I am a control and I direct sequence by keystroke 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.460
 not 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.680

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:32.009
 we are happy because yes of course% to 6 33 points 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:35.009
 the falcon once training I think my role 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:38.569
 level of efficiency am not far from 10 0% 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.279
 and I can not see soma first hit I'm going to play 

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:46.279
 see the action I'm doing 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.050
 descent a little untied 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.590
 kim in the skylight 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.590
 well I can not dream better for
