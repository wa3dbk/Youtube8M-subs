00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.020
 ae 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.389
 who talks about my new lighting 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.980
 of the videos and also the photos that I 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:16.650
 I bought two soft boxes or two soft boxes. 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.990
 I do not know two soft boxes I think it 's like this 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.939
 What do you say and that's how I'm going to talk? 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.580
 also there at the beginning of the channel when 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.070
 I record video instead I never used one 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.890
 another kind of lighting I used two 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.920
 halogen light guns and heated 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.750
 very very very much was so 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.110
 hot that arrived at the point that if I 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.239
 a type of lit time 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.230
 three hours for example it warmed 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.390
 so much so that it burst she burned 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.420
 exploding like that happened to me two 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.489
 Sometimes illusory shop not a cheap light 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.410
 a light that I like more or less 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.320
 four times the value of a light 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.809
 good fluorescent that mega lucida 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.239
 so powerful and in addition to the lamp dry 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.579
 she also consumed a lot of energy then 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.830
 my laser bill into space then 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.409
 I decided to stop using store classes. 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.070
 was using only natural light even light 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.110
 of the day 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.460
 only that I was very limited only with 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.400
 the light of day because I had to 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.409
 recordings at certain times and also in light of 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.869
 It kept changing so I did not have total 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.939
 light control I could even regulate 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.830
 passage of luiz in the camera but even 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.590
 so I had to keep regulating 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.689
 many times during the video in the month of 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.000
 April I finally decided to invest in 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.189
 set of softball to improve the 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.200
 quality of the photos' videos and not 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.759
 stay so dependent on natural light 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.130
 so I'm going to show the set I 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.110
 I bought it and I will tell you where I bought it. 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.090
 talk about my experience as well 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.310
 I already had old lighting then already 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.470
 I had the tripods I only needed 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.570
 buy software box even i want one 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.549
 Powerful x-men softball set for 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.710
 that I did not need to stay 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.380
 natural light and could record any 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.790
 time of day so I opted for a soft box 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.799
 four locations 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.079
 I bought in the express I'll leave the 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.850
 seller link there in the blog post o 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.979
 blog post will be down here at 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.140
 video description i did not buy from 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.780
 soft boxes together I made two purchases 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.270
 separated because the seller charged a 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.020
 freight very expensive if the package was 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.480
 more than 1 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.470
 then split into two purchases to pay 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.680
 the lower freight 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.720
 the total was $ 37 each soft boxes 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.490
 include the price of freight and freight 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.320
 it was about four dollars 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.150
 the time I bought the dollar was 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.940
 Too expensive so I paid more or less 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.250
 a few 90 reais each soft box as 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.410
 made two separate purchases then each 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.230
 one arrives one day the first I receive 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.240
 last week and I was taxed at 35 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.150
 Real then it became more or less 130 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.430
 real by a soft box softball height 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.800
 that arrived this week I was not taxed 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.660
 then the total adding up this price 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.020
 The rate that I paid stayed more or less. 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.850
 210 reais for the two soft boxes they do not 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.710
 came with lamps I had to buy 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.390
 separately but I bought it here at 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.700
 Brazil, because I was scared. 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.560
 break during the same day trip 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.050
 that the first softball I got was 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.510
 very enthusiastic and bought four 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.430
 20-volt bulbs to test but I 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.320
 I did not think the light was so strong. 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.410
 so when the other softball that arrived 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.750
 I went and bought eight 34- volt bulbs 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.640
 10 if you stayed by the profiles made very strong 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.770
 that I could record until night 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.890
 Even I'm recording the night. 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.810
 no other light on soft box same 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.630
 I put one on each side to 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.940
 to balance the light well and 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.530
 Legal and video quality also I 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.750
 I'll show you how it's working. 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.550
 here without the soft boxes 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.860
 I'm going to pay only the football for you to see. 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.959
 How do you stay and stay there? 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.630
 that the bumper sticker but actually 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.820
 It's all dark here where I'm alone. 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.140
 I'm recording with the soft box light 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.140
 so now I'll light it again 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.790
 now it 's only 100 days soft box in my 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.800
 left then now I'm going to call another 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.500
 soft box that is here on my right 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.420
 now with the two soft box lit 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.430
 lighting gets a lot better and I just 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.680
 I'm using them and I can see that I 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.660
 I need them I do not need any 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.910
 another light of support because they can 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.070
 light superbem greatly improve 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.650
 video quality each soft box has 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.780
 two switches and each switch 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.459
 regulates two lamps another thing 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.250
 important to speak is that the 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.979
 totally different from the ones taken here 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.050
 Why Soft Boxing Day in China? 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:26.240
 the pattern of taking 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.610
 totally different china from here but 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.699
 the seller sends two adapters to 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.440
 you can connect soft box to softball 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:35.780
 who arrived in less than 20 days was 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.360
 very fast for those who usually buy 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.000
 know that they know the same fast and 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.370
 seller of the soft tracking code 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.440
 Very good ballad boxing comes inside 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.930
 a box that comes inside plastic 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.360
 bubble and also it comes dismantled all 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.520
 double inside a black bag 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.740
 of nylon and the end of the 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.810
 I spent more bulbs than in soft 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.810
 box because I bought eight 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:03.319
 34 otis and before I had bought four 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:05.360
 lamps of 20 then total spent us 250 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:07.969
 only in bulbs was more expensive than 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.400
 the soft box but still compensated for a 

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:13.250
 soft box similar to this one of four 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.199
 places sold for about R $ 250 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.300
 here in Brazil it was very worth it 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:19.789
 because I paid on average 100 reais in 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.310
 every soft box and it's also cool to say that 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:24.919
 The less buccal you have the more soft box 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.629
 cheap is then the soft box of a local is 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:29.120
 much cheaper than the ones I 

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:31.370
 I bought but then it goes according to your 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.289
 need and also of course that will stay 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.389
 more expensive if you need to buy 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:37.550
 tripod of my case I did not need then 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:39.860
 I ended up saving a little bit all 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.840
 information and a link from the seller that 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.550
 I bought will be there in the blog post 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.830
 So I'll leave the post link here. 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.630
 below in the video description is only 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.960
 click and check it will be all for 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.849
 over there 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.860
 I hope you liked the video 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:54.080

 in the disclosure of the kiss channel that
