00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:26.979 
going to be a lot lower scoring I'm
expecting<00:02:24.079> a<00:02:24.430> score<00:02:25.430> more<00:02:25.790> on<00:02:26.030> par<00:02:26.629> with<00:02:26.659> the

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
expecting a score more on par with the

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:32.500 
expecting a score more on par with the
fail<00:02:27.469> Mary<00:02:27.500> game<00:02:28.390> from<00:02:30.220> 2012<00:02:31.239> right<00:02:32.239> these<00:02:32.480> are
