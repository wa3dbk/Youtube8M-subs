00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 Today we are going to talk about stretching, something much more important than it seems 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.459
 for your health and your performance. 

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:12.049
 Let the hand raise the one that dedicates a few minutes to stretch always before 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:14.739
 ride a bike and after finishing the route, 

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:18.849
 I see very few hands in fact mine could lift it but only a little. 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:20.630
 Stretching is something you never want 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.529
 that we always find an excuse 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:23.810
 not to do it 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:24.890
 and a data 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.680
 for you to take into account, note that cyclists like Cancellara within the 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.450
 enormous number of hours that enter daily devote to him to stretch a 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.670
 daily hour, just to stretch. 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.670
 In this video I will not be able to teach anything, I will learn and for that we have 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.100
 brought a great stretcher expert with over 15 years as a yoga teacher 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.840
 international and many more experience as a cyclist, 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.080
 David, David, uh ... it's your turn. 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.270
 Yes, in this video 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.420
 we'll see 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.350
 a brief and effective sequence of stretches before riding in 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.980
 bike 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.830
 to prevent injuries and to improve our performance, 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.270
 nothing more, I leave you with him. 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.990
 First let's start with the back, let's stretch it 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.840
 so that it does not bother us 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.060
 during the route 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.040
 we are going to hold the handlebar with the heels of the hands with the part of 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.540
 down the hands 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.570
 and we are going to move the pelvis away, this area of ​​the body 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.680
 let's move it away 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.010
 of the hands, notice that my legs are semi-flexed 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.240
 I bend the pelvis, I do not want to be like that, I do not want to be with my back stooped 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.490
 I want to rock the pelvis this gesture 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.100
 to lengthen the back, release the sides release the column 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.630
 so I'm continuously pushing the handlebar forward and the 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.240
 buttocks back 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.170
 the pelvis is continuously moving away 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.290
 of the handlebar, 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.870
 from my hands 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.530
 and the shoulders, 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.660
 look at my shoulders 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.830
 that being close to the ears what they do is this gesture 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.380
 get away from the ears 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.909
 The farther the better 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.920
 the arms as you see are active 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.660
 because we are pushing the handlebar 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.029
 and here I breathe 

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:15.509
 half a minute or a minute what is most comfortable for you. 

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:19.329
 Next exercise, let's work the twins 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:23.499
 so that it yields better, so that we do not have pulls, so that we do not have 

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:28.489
 contractures and to prevent injuries so what we do is with the leg 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:29.489
 lead 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.209
 flex it and leave all the weight in it, 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.980
 in such a way that we support the back heel 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.019
 on the floor 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.939
 and the calf 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:40.500
 when you do, you will notice 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.779
 is going to stretch a lot 

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:46.019
 The more we want to stretch it, the more we will go down 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.229
 you can take the brakes 

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:50.299
 and so you have a firmer support 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:52.429
 the brakes of the bike 

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:56.560
 and the pelvis as low as we can the lower down 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.829
 more we will stretch 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:01.320
 See? Here I am projecting it later 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.079
 but if this is impossible for me I will stay in a softer posture 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.779
 and then we will repeat with the other side 

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:14.959
 now we do not need the bike anymore. 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.719
 Now let's work the back of the body, from the ankles to the nape, 

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:21.599
 let's stretch the hamstrings, which are 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.469
 all these, this muscle chain 

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:27.299
 from the buttocks 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.819
 to the ankles, look, 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.019
 let's work with the legs a little flexed 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.679
 and at this point, uh ... look, we do not want to bounce 

00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:40.489
 we do not want to do this 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.589
 because this is what leads to muscle 

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:46.459
 have to defend and contract 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.689
 to prevent overstretching 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:52.089
 so what we do is work by gravity, 

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:53.569
 leaving the trunk 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.249
 just hanging 

00:03:57.249 --> 00:03:59.989
 and to optimize this stretch 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.919
 let's complement it 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:06.209
 with a phase of taking air and another of releasing air, 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.969
 when we take a breath we are going to release the column, 

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:13.009
 let's lengthen the column forward 

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:15.409
 leaning on the pimples 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:18.379
 or on the ground if we can, 

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:21.509
 OK? Here we inhale, we take a breath 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:27.699
 and when releasing the air I simply relax the trunk, the arms and the head 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:33.169
 and we repeat it between five and ten times when you take a long breath, see my 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:34.539
 back? It is straight, 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:37.229
 it is not like that 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:41.279
 and when we release the air simply 

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:43.840
 eh ... we relax trunk, head and arms 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.750
 and then I could stay in this posture breathing after those 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.860
 five or ten repetitions. 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.159
 One last exercise to stretch a very important part that we use 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:55.550
 cyclists, the part 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.060
 anterior thigh 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.999
 the quadriceps 

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:03.269
 We are going to stay at the lame leg, we can grab the handlebar of the bike or 

00:05:03.269 --> 00:05:06.249
 hold on something or do it like that if we have balance 

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:08.070
 it's about wearing the heel 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.270
 towards the buttock, 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.490
 as much as possible. 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:16.110
 The closer the heel is to the buttock, it is more intense but 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.509
 It does not hurt, you do not have to hurt the stretch. 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:24.590
 The more elongated the muscle, the more flexible 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:25.630
 and elongated 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.060
 It has more capacity for contraction so it's going to 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.919
 optimize performance 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:35.319
 Stretching works optimize muscular performance in a way 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:37.830
 very clear 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.189
 then 

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:40.860
 with the other leg 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.219
 half a minute, one minute is 

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:45.620
 enough 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.889
 breathing quietly 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:52.080
 because quiet breathing is what will allow the muscle to stretch 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.339
 to relax and then you can stretch 

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:56.819
 and after this 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:02.389
 we can go riding. 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:03.569
 Goodbye. 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:05.029
 David has escaped us, 

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:09.049
 but we will have you here for the next video explaining the 

00:06:09.049 --> 00:06:12.819
 necessary stretches for after riding a bike. That I do not give you laziness 

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:17.109
 stretch and since you are giving the "I like" if it has been interesting and 

00:06:17.109 --> 00:06:21.289
 share it in your networks, because you will be sharing health and performance on 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:24.099
 the bike. Thanks for listening and until the next video.
