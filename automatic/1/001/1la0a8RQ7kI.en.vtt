man you're gonna completely destroy
those<00:00:16.980> parts<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.520> so<00:00:18.210> since<00:00:18.390> I've<00:00:18.539> got<00:00:18.690> this

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
those parts and so since I've got this

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.450 
those parts and so since I've got this
hundred<00:00:19.140> dollar<00:00:19.320> PC<00:00:19.770> in<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:19.890> back<00:00:20.130> here<00:00:20.369> and

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
hundred dollar PC in the back here and

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.099 
hundred dollar PC in the back here and
I've<00:00:20.550> already<00:00:20.730> been<00:00:21.029> running<00:00:21.270> a<00:00:21.420> few<00:00:21.630> tests<00:00:21.990> on

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
I've already been running a few tests on

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.170 
I've already been running a few tests on
it<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.289> thought<00:00:22.500> hey<00:00:22.650> why<00:00:22.920> not<00:00:22.949> just<00:00:23.220> charge

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
it I thought hey why not just charge

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.359 
it I thought hey why not just charge
myself<00:00:24.420> up<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.109> then<00:00:25.230> touch<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.680> pots<00:00:26.130> and

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
myself up and then touch the pots and

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.460 
myself up and then touch the pots and
then<00:00:26.519> see<00:00:26.730> if<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:26.939> still<00:00:27.210> turns<00:00:27.480> on<00:00:27.689> so<00:00:28.289> let's

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
then see if it still turns on so let's

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:38.170 
then see if it still turns on so let's
do<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.619> couple<00:00:28.830> of<00:00:29.070> tests

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.460

you guys there with a video on static

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.190 
you guys there with a video on static
electricity<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.520> how<00:00:45.030> much<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.630> is<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.840> bad

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
electricity and how much of it is a bad

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.860 
electricity and how much of it is a bad
thing<00:00:46.560> and<00:00:46.800> so<00:00:47.310> before<00:00:47.790> doing<00:00:48.060> this<00:00:48.300> video<00:00:48.480> I

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
thing and so before doing this video I

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.110 
thing and so before doing this video I
did<00:00:49.170> watch<00:00:49.470> another<00:00:50.010> video<00:00:50.430> from<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.820> channel

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
did watch another video from a channel

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.420 
did watch another video from a channel
called<00:00:51.420> do-it-yourself<00:00:52.290> trying<00:00:52.740> and<00:00:53.010> now<00:00:53.370> the

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
called do-it-yourself trying and now the

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.520 
called do-it-yourself trying and now the
video<00:00:53.760> was<00:00:54.060> very<00:00:54.480> entertaining<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.380> was

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
video was very entertaining and it was

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.650 
video was very entertaining and it was
very<00:00:55.710> funny<00:00:56.040> and<00:00:56.250> one<00:00:56.640> thing<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:56.880> a<00:00:57.030> did<00:00:57.360> show

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
very funny and one thing that a did show

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.960 
very funny and one thing that a did show
is<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:57.900> static<00:00:58.500> electricity<00:00:58.890> can<00:00:59.460> damage

00:00:59.960 --> 00:00:59.970 
is that static electricity can damage

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.120 
is that static electricity can damage
parts<00:01:00.570> though<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.200> just<00:01:01.590> think<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.920> conditions

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.130 
parts though I just think the conditions

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.700 
parts though I just think the conditions
were<00:01:02.640> not<00:01:02.940> even<00:01:03.360> remotely<00:01:03.900> similar<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.530> a

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
were not even remotely similar to a

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.160 
were not even remotely similar to a
real-world<00:01:05.040> environment<00:01:05.730> and<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:06.780> today<00:01:07.050> I'm

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
real-world environment and so today I'm

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.480 
real-world environment and so today I'm
going<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.380> try<00:01:07.590> some<00:01:07.800> real-world<00:01:08.040> conditions

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
going to try some real-world conditions

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.700 
going to try some real-world conditions
touch<00:01:09.360> these<00:01:09.630> parts<00:01:10.050> and<00:01:10.200> see<00:01:10.470> if<00:01:10.590> the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
touch these parts and see if the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.980 
touch these parts and see if the
computers<00:01:11.220> well<00:01:11.940> the<00:01:12.030> computer<00:01:12.450> still<00:01:12.690> boots

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
computers well the computer still boots

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.600 
computers well the computer still boots
up

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
up

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.070 
up
so<00:01:14.610> first<00:01:14.850> up<00:01:15.000> here<00:01:15.210> we<00:01:15.300> have<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.510> Seagate

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
so first up here we have the Seagate

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.330 
so first up here we have the Seagate
hard<00:01:16.380> drive<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:16.770> I'm<00:01:16.830> just<00:01:16.950> going<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.130> quickly

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
hard drive so I'm just going to quickly

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.880 
hard drive so I'm just going to quickly
charge<00:01:17.729> myself<00:01:18.150> put<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.840> in<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:18.960> computer<00:01:19.260> see

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
charge myself put it in the computer see

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:37.960 
charge myself put it in the computer see
if<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.070> boots<00:01:20.280> up

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.850 

so<00:01:38.970> here's<00:01:39.240> test<00:01:39.600> one<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.230> it<00:01:40.650> looks<00:01:40.800> like

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
so here's test one and it looks like

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.450 
so here's test one and it looks like
it's<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.190> pass<00:01:41.430> for<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.360> hard<00:01:43.050> disk<00:01:43.320> drive<00:01:43.460> so

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
it's a pass for the hard disk drive so

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.730 
it's a pass for the hard disk drive so
charging<00:01:44.910> ourselves<00:01:45.330> up<00:01:45.479> on<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.750> carpet<00:01:46.170> and

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
charging ourselves up on the carpet and

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.990 
charging ourselves up on the carpet and
then<00:01:46.830> touching<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.340> hard<00:01:47.520> drive<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:47.880> then

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
then touching the hard drive and then

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.969 
then touching the hard drive and then
stalling<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.830> ungrounded<00:01:49.830> computer

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
stalling it to a ungrounded computer

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.680 
stalling it to a ungrounded computer
still<00:01:52.979> results<00:01:53.369> in<00:01:53.460> this<00:01:53.580> computer<00:01:53.940> booting

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
still results in this computer booting

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.900 
still results in this computer booting
up<00:01:54.840> into<00:01:55.440> Windows<00:01:55.770> let's<00:01:56.460> move<00:01:56.640> on<00:01:56.760> now<00:01:56.880> to

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
up into Windows let's move on now to

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:20.780 
up into Windows let's move on now to

so<00:02:25.800> it's<00:02:26.160> like<00:02:26.400> test<00:02:26.730> number<00:02:27.000> two<00:02:27.150> is<00:02:27.330> passed

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
so it's like test number two is passed

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.380 
so it's like test number two is passed
as<00:02:27.870> well<00:02:27.950> so<00:02:28.950> now<00:02:29.130> we'll<00:02:29.310> try<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:29.670> graphics

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
as well so now we'll try the graphics

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:59.809 
as well so now we'll try the graphics
card

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.819 

so<00:03:00.819> here's<00:03:01.090> test<00:03:01.390> number<00:03:01.780> three<00:03:02.230> this<00:03:02.469> is<00:03:02.530> the

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
so here's test number three this is the

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:05.640 
so here's test number three this is the
graphics<00:03:03.310> card<00:03:03.609> and<00:03:04.049> it's<00:03:05.049> booting<00:03:05.500> up

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
graphics card and it's booting up

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.500 
graphics card and it's booting up
everything's<00:03:06.310> booting<00:03:06.639> up<00:03:06.760> fine<00:03:07.060> so<00:03:07.329> let's

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
everything's booting up fine so let's

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.420 
everything's booting up fine so let's
get<00:03:07.659> on<00:03:07.780> to<00:03:07.900> the<00:03:07.989> final<00:03:08.650> test<00:03:08.889> now<00:03:09.099> where<00:03:09.310> I'm

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
get on to the final test now where I'm

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.599 
get on to the final test now where I'm
going<00:03:09.700> to<00:03:09.849> charge<00:03:10.269> myself<00:03:10.870> up<00:03:11.109> as<00:03:11.319> best<00:03:12.250> as<00:03:12.489> I

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
going to charge myself up as best as I

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.429 
going to charge myself up as best as I
can<00:03:12.879> and<00:03:13.060> then<00:03:13.180> touch<00:03:13.389> the<00:03:13.629> motherboard<00:03:14.139> which

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:14.439 
can and then touch the motherboard which

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:16.080 
can and then touch the motherboard which
is<00:03:14.590> essentially<00:03:15.069> connected<00:03:15.459> to<00:03:15.489> everything

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
is essentially connected to everything

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.179 
is essentially connected to everything
and<00:03:16.299> then<00:03:17.109> we'll<00:03:17.260> try<00:03:17.560> and<00:03:17.680> see<00:03:17.799> if<00:03:17.889> it<00:03:17.980> turns

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:18.189 
and then we'll try and see if it turns

00:03:18.189 --> 00:04:24.420 
and then we'll try and see if it turns
on<00:04:19.739> okay<00:04:20.739> so<00:04:20.799> here<00:04:21.130> is<00:04:21.220> the<00:04:21.250> final<00:04:21.699> test<00:04:22.180> I<00:04:23.430> just

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
on okay so here is the final test I just

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.339 
on okay so here is the final test I just
thought<00:04:24.639> I'd<00:04:24.820> show<00:04:25.560> you<00:04:26.560> guys<00:04:28.139> without<00:04:29.139> any

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:29.349 
thought I'd show you guys without any

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:34.469 
thought I'd show you guys without any
breaks<00:04:29.710> or<00:04:29.889> anything<00:04:30.130> like<00:04:30.430> that<00:04:30.490> so<00:04:33.479> looks

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
breaks or anything like that so looks

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:37.080 
breaks or anything like that so looks
like<00:04:34.690> it<00:04:34.810> might<00:04:34.960> have<00:04:34.990> froze<00:04:35.849> this<00:04:36.849> time

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
like it might have froze this time

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.350 
like it might have froze this time
around<00:04:37.360> I<00:04:37.509> might<00:04:37.630> have<00:04:37.750> froze<00:04:38.020> on<00:04:38.199> boot<00:04:39.360> let's

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
around I might have froze on boot let's

00:04:40.360 --> 00:05:00.980 
around I might have froze on boot let's
try<00:04:40.570> and<00:04:40.690> restart<00:04:41.080> it

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.420 

okay<00:05:01.990> looks<00:05:02.200> like<00:05:02.260> it's<00:05:02.410> booting<00:05:02.980> this<00:05:03.160> time

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
okay looks like it's booting this time

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.700 
okay looks like it's booting this time
so<00:05:06.030> let's<00:05:07.030> uh<00:05:07.240> let's<00:05:08.200> move<00:05:08.380> on<00:05:08.560> to<00:05:08.590> a

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
so let's uh let's move on to a

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.590 
so let's uh let's move on to a
conclusion<00:05:09.370> this<00:05:09.580> is<00:05:09.790> booting<00:05:10.210> and<00:05:10.360> it<00:05:10.420> looks

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
conclusion this is booting and it looks

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.940 
conclusion this is booting and it looks
like<00:05:10.690> it<00:05:10.960> yeah<00:05:11.080> it's<00:05:11.110> booting<00:05:11.500> into<00:05:11.620> Windows

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
like it yeah it's booting into Windows

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.820 
like it yeah it's booting into Windows
absolutely<00:05:12.550> fine<00:05:12.820> so<00:05:13.210> for<00:05:14.020> tests<00:05:14.440> and<00:05:14.620> for

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
absolutely fine so for tests and for

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.230 
absolutely fine so for tests and for
passes<00:05:15.460> let's<00:05:15.640> move<00:05:15.880> on<00:05:16.000> to<00:05:16.090> conclusion<00:05:16.600> now

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
passes let's move on to conclusion now

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.970 
passes let's move on to conclusion now
so<00:05:19.240> in<00:05:19.360> conclusion<00:05:19.510> besides<00:05:20.290> working<00:05:20.590> up<00:05:20.890> a

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:20.980 
so in conclusion besides working up a

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.310 
so in conclusion besides working up a
sweat<00:05:21.010> we<00:05:21.730> didn't<00:05:22.090> manage<00:05:22.210> to<00:05:22.450> damage<00:05:22.990> any<00:05:23.200> of

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
sweat we didn't manage to damage any of

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.170 
sweat we didn't manage to damage any of
these<00:05:23.500> components<00:05:24.130> that's<00:05:24.610> not<00:05:24.820> to<00:05:24.970> say

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
these components that's not to say

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.760 
these components that's not to say
though<00:05:25.360> that<00:05:25.390> static<00:05:25.870> electricity<00:05:26.260> can't

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
though that static electricity can't

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.200 
though that static electricity can't
damage<00:05:27.010> computer<00:05:27.460> parts<00:05:27.820> I<00:05:27.880> think<00:05:28.120> the

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
damage computer parts I think the

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.450 
damage computer parts I think the
do-it-yourself<00:05:28.900> training<00:05:29.440> video<00:05:29.710> already

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
do-it-yourself training video already

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.640 
do-it-yourself training video already
proved<00:05:31.000> that<00:05:31.330> you<00:05:31.510> can<00:05:31.660> very<00:05:31.990> well<00:05:32.080> damage

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
proved that you can very well damage

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.410 
proved that you can very well damage
computer<00:05:33.520> components<00:05:33.970> with<00:05:34.090> static

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:34.420 
computer components with static

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.210 
computer components with static
electricity<00:05:34.780> in<00:05:35.200> the<00:05:35.770> sense<00:05:35.950> that<00:05:36.040> you're

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
electricity in the sense that you're

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.650 
electricity in the sense that you're
over<00:05:36.550> vaulting<00:05:37.000> or<00:05:37.180> putting<00:05:37.450> too<00:05:37.540> much

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
over vaulting or putting too much

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.980 
over vaulting or putting too much
voltage<00:05:37.930> through<00:05:38.740> the<00:05:38.860> said<00:05:39.070> components

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
voltage through the said components

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.690 
voltage through the said components
however<00:05:40.990> I<00:05:41.380> mean<00:05:41.680> it<00:05:41.950> was<00:05:42.190> kind<00:05:42.400> of<00:05:42.490> pointless

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:42.700 
however I mean it was kind of pointless

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.000 
however I mean it was kind of pointless
in<00:05:43.030> a<00:05:43.090> way<00:05:43.240> because<00:05:43.540> as<00:05:43.690> overclockers<00:05:44.350> we

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.010 
in a way because as overclockers we

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.410 
in a way because as overclockers we
already<00:05:45.280> know<00:05:45.520> that<00:05:45.550> if<00:05:45.820> you<00:05:45.910> put<00:05:46.120> too<00:05:46.300> many

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:46.420 
already know that if you put too many

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.600 
already know that if you put too many
volts<00:05:46.900> through<00:05:47.110> a<00:05:47.140> component<00:05:47.770> you'll<00:05:48.220> fry<00:05:48.550> it

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
volts through a component you'll fry it

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.790 
volts through a component you'll fry it
so<00:05:48.970> basically<00:05:49.570> with<00:05:49.750> my<00:05:49.780> tester<00:05:50.320> I<00:05:50.350> wanted<00:05:50.710> to

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
so basically with my tester I wanted to

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.860 
so basically with my tester I wanted to
test<00:05:51.040> hey<00:05:51.310> in<00:05:52.240> real-world<00:05:52.660> conditions

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
test hey in real-world conditions

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.780 
test hey in real-world conditions
rubbing<00:05:53.530> your<00:05:53.620> feet<00:05:53.830> on<00:05:54.010> carpet

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:54.790 
rubbing your feet on carpet

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.900 
rubbing your feet on carpet
whatever<00:05:56.160> producing<00:05:57.160> a<00:05:57.280> certain<00:05:57.670> you<00:05:57.820> know

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:57.910 
whatever producing a certain you know

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:59.100 
whatever producing a certain you know
just<00:05:58.120> a<00:05:58.210> little<00:05:58.510> bit<00:05:58.600> of<00:05:58.690> static<00:05:59.020> electricity

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
just a little bit of static electricity

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.170 
just a little bit of static electricity
is<00:05:59.680> that<00:05:59.860> enough<00:06:00.160> to<00:06:00.340> damage<00:06:00.580> computer

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 
is that enough to damage computer

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.360 
is that enough to damage computer
components<00:06:01.690> and<00:06:01.840> in<00:06:02.320> the<00:06:02.410> last<00:06:02.590> case<00:06:02.920> we<00:06:03.160> saw

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
components and in the last case we saw

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.310 
components and in the last case we saw
that<00:06:03.520> my<00:06:03.670> computer<00:06:03.970> didn't<00:06:04.360> boot<00:06:04.630> properly<00:06:05.140> so

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:05.320 
that my computer didn't boot properly so

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.170 
that my computer didn't boot properly so
that<00:06:05.350> was<00:06:05.560> pretty<00:06:05.800> interesting<00:06:06.430> though<00:06:06.610> none

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.180 
that was pretty interesting though none

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.270 
that was pretty interesting though none
of<00:06:07.270> the<00:06:07.360> components<00:06:07.870> are<00:06:07.960> damaged<00:06:08.530> and<00:06:08.800> as

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 
of the components are damaged and as

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.610 
of the components are damaged and as
I've<00:06:09.460> also<00:06:09.640> as<00:06:09.880> a<00:06:09.910> final<00:06:10.390> test<00:06:10.630> I<00:06:10.870> did<00:06:11.050> decide

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.620 
I've also as a final test I did decide

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.290 
I've also as a final test I did decide
to<00:06:11.740> take<00:06:11.950> it<00:06:12.100> down<00:06:12.310> on<00:06:12.460> the<00:06:12.550> weekend<00:06:13.030> to<00:06:13.180> the

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:13.300 
to take it down on the weekend to the

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.330 
to take it down on the weekend to the
park<00:06:13.570> and<00:06:13.810> go<00:06:14.440> down<00:06:14.590> the<00:06:14.710> slippery<00:06:14.980> slide

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:15.340 
park and go down the slippery slide

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.370 
park and go down the slippery slide
where<00:06:15.580> I<00:06:15.610> actually<00:06:15.730> managed<00:06:16.210> to<00:06:16.240> zap<00:06:16.750> the

where I actually managed to zap the
computer<00:06:18.010> and<00:06:18.330> so<00:06:19.330> it<00:06:19.810> still<00:06:20.200> survived<00:06:20.680> so<00:06:21.610> how

and<00:07:05.140> they've<00:07:05.260> still<00:07:05.560> worked<00:07:05.800> so<00:07:06.490> that's<00:07:06.640> why

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:06.760 
and they've still worked so that's why

that's a way to describe it against the
whole<00:07:14.090> static<00:07:14.510> electricity<00:07:14.930> thing<00:07:15.410> and<00:07:15.590> I

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:16.040 
whole static electricity thing and I

whole static electricity thing and I

normal level of statically shocking
things<00:07:24.560> I<00:07:24.710> went<00:07:24.920> beyond<00:07:25.310> the<00:07:25.430> mile<00:07:25.610> I<00:07:25.880> didn't

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:26.540 
things I went beyond the mile I didn't

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.750 
things I went beyond the mile I didn't
know<00:07:26.660> what<00:07:26.870> the<00:07:26.990> results<00:07:27.440> would<00:07:27.620> be<00:07:27.680> I<00:07:28.070> didn't

know what the results would be I didn't

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.720 
know what the results would be I didn't
know<00:07:28.880> that's<00:07:29.060> why<00:07:29.270> I<00:07:29.300> tested<00:07:29.750> it<00:07:29.810> on<00:07:29.930> my<00:07:30.140> cheap

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:30.730 
know that's why I tested it on my cheap

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:34.180 
know that's why I tested it on my cheap
rig<00:07:31.730> that<00:07:32.030> already<00:07:32.360> has<00:07:32.600> four<00:07:33.020> dead<00:07:33.410> RAM<00:07:33.710> slots

bye<00:07:57.890> for<00:07:58.340> circuitry<00:07:58.850> so<00:07:59.180> what<00:07:59.750> I've<00:07:59.870> done<00:07:59.990> with

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:00.170 
bye for circuitry so what I've done with

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:01.810 
bye for circuitry so what I've done with
this<00:08:00.260> memory<00:08:00.620> of<00:08:00.680> us<00:08:00.830> sprayed<00:08:01.220> on<00:08:01.370> seven

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:01.820 
this memory of us sprayed on seven

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.180 
this memory of us sprayed on seven
different<00:08:01.940> kinds<00:08:02.450> of<00:08:02.510> spray<00:08:02.840> paint<00:08:03.170> so<00:08:03.710> on<00:08:04.070> the

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:04.190 
different kinds of spray paint so on the

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:06.870 
different kinds of spray paint so on the
right<00:08:04.340> we<00:08:04.370> got<00:08:04.550> a<00:08:04.580> white<00:08:05.060> gold<00:08:05.570> silver<00:08:05.750> pink

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:06.880 
right we got a white gold silver pink

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.970 
right we got a white gold silver pink
black<00:08:07.880> and<00:08:08.210> white<00:08:08.810> I've<00:08:09.230> just<00:08:09.440> sprayed<00:08:09.740> it<00:08:09.860> all

black and white I've just sprayed it all

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.560 
black and white I've just sprayed it all
on<00:08:10.160> made<00:08:10.400> sure<00:08:10.580> I've<00:08:10.700> got<00:08:10.730> it<00:08:10.970> on<00:08:11.090> the<00:08:11.180> circuit

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:11.570 
on made sure I've got it on the circuit

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:13.000 
on made sure I've got it on the circuit
there<00:08:11.840> so<00:08:12.350> I'm<00:08:12.530> just<00:08:12.560> going<00:08:12.770> to<00:08:12.800> put<00:08:12.920> this
