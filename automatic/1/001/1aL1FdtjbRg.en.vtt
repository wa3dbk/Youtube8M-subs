00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
you're making an egg custard you don't

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.230 
you're making an egg custard you don't
always<00:01:21.380> add<00:01:21.740> cornflour<00:01:22.160> but<00:01:22.940> if<00:01:23.030> we<00:01:23.119> add<00:01:23.210> a

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
always add cornflour but if we add a

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.760 
always add cornflour but if we add a
tablespoon<00:01:23.750> of<00:01:23.810> cornflour<00:01:24.229> there's<00:01:24.500> less

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
tablespoon of cornflour there's less

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.469 
tablespoon of cornflour there's less
chance<00:01:24.800> of<00:01:25.220> our<00:01:25.340> custard<00:01:25.670> separating<00:01:26.240> and

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
chance of our custard separating and

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:27.670 
chance of our custard separating and
then<00:01:26.869> we're<00:01:26.990> just<00:01:27.020> going<00:01:27.259> to<00:01:27.290> whisk<00:01:27.440> this

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
then we're just going to whisk this

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.530 
then we're just going to whisk this
until<00:01:27.920> the<00:01:28.250> egg<00:01:28.400> yolks<00:01:28.700> lighten<00:01:29.300> slightly

until the egg yolks lighten slightly

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.270 
until the egg yolks lighten slightly

just temper these eggs slightly so I'm

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.180 
just temper these eggs slightly so I'm
going<00:01:43.700> to<00:01:43.819> pour<00:01:44.179> a<00:01:44.210> small<00:01:44.539> amount<00:01:45.100> into<00:01:46.100> the

and bring it up to a point where this

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.120 
and bring it up to a point where this
thickens<00:02:11.450> slightly<00:02:11.600> now<00:02:12.530> bought<00:02:12.830> that<00:02:12.980> off
