00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 so much for twenty-first game 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.259
 valbuena the ball runs well on the first 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.450
 varun pole head with the second goal 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.590
 france shirt for us all still 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.630
 and it affects the poor and more or less 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.400
 kicked as on the previous occasion 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.470
 he had gone to the contrast with the ball 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.359
 splashed at the second post was enough 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.789
 jefferson's big parade instead here but 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.769
 just in advance the touches the goes to 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.810
 bagging the second stake by surprise 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.269
 once again the Brazil network 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.250
 let's see if they make any markings says 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.380
 they are markings and it is precisely a 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.469
 miranda seems to me to be marking on barun 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.870
 that fails to go well 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:41.760
 great advance great goal it was 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.500
 saved somehow before the 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.239
 brazil with jefferson's parade 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.620
 here he could have done nothing with the 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.870
 france shirt in his first and 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.430
 the draw was the only captain's game 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.739
 smashes daughter against sweden 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.949
 marks his first goal and in this 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.949
 Stadium 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.390
 oscar 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.960
 a large part of Brazil marks oscar and 11 lo 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.960
 state france 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.710
 here the artist then opens a contact 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.260
 x ray mar 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:21.150
 kick neymar there is always his signature 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.180
 43rd after the selecao the brazil in 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.400
 advantage in comeback 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.110
 a great goal surely once again 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.610
 with these he retrieves fast ball with 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.040
 willian who holds his position 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.820
 you see it you find it centrally when you 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.820
 tip hurts you 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.670
 the first check for having expanded 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.720
 too neymar is closed instead it is high if 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.540
 I am not mistaken see here is good at 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.630
 anticipate evra and then bring the door 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.190
 with with this external foot 12 per 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.710
 find the placement on the other side 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.570
 of neymar control and then col 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.890
 left at the near post I am the goalkeeper 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.020
 here must stay alive the most 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.720
 It is possible to let go too 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.960
 if it is very close and kicks it high high 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.340
 is the error of the French defense has 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.500
 inside the area it seems ready to return 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.130
 and look at the flag stroke 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.290
 of a line for Brazil but the play 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.140
 to the header and the goal by luis 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.080
 gustavo 31 also affects brazil from 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.330
 I am in love with this 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.130
 player why 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.040
 he is not very talented though he is 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.920
 very useful to the team is always at 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.140
 right place and then it is also good in the 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.420
 air game and here is the goal 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.160
 we'll see him again because I want to understand how 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.940
 never one jumps all alone in the area 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.260
 of replied from a blog to enter and yes 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.760
 he is found alone and smashed and has 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.150
 found the second pole very well 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.280
 probably also deschamps asking 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.230
 what happened on this corner 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.900
 here it is the second one as national 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.939
 answer goes 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.980
 yes because it starts from behind in my opinion 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:57.560
 without marking in three against three 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.810
 therefore they certainly have disunited and 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.819
 they haven't seen him coming from behind and 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.620
 he arrives with the right time crushes 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:07.569
 the ball touches the ground and is not there 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.569
 nothing for the doorman to do this
