me<00:01:38.960> on<00:01:38.990> that<00:01:39.110> guys<00:01:39.520> but<00:01:40.520> then<00:01:40.640> that's<00:01:40.760> what<00:01:41.060> I'm

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
me on that guys but then that's what I'm

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.700 
me on that guys but then that's what I'm
going<00:01:41.270> to<00:01:41.330> put<00:01:41.479> i'm<00:01:41.600> going<00:01:41.720> to<00:01:41.780> put<00:01:41.870> 350<00:01:42.380> grams

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
going to put i'm going to put 350 grams

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.060 
going to put i'm going to put 350 grams
of<00:01:42.979> just<00:01:43.400> white<00:01:43.820> rice<00:01:44.240> cooked<00:01:44.720> so<00:01:45.620> that's<00:01:45.799> that

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
of just white rice cooked so that's that

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.890 
of just white rice cooked so that's that
for<00:01:46.280> this<00:01:46.490> one<00:01:46.700> right<00:01:46.820> here<00:01:46.909> and<00:01:47.210> now<00:01:47.299> let's

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
for this one right here and now let's

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.420 
for this one right here and now let's
talk<00:01:48.049> about<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:48.350> courier<00:01:48.740> right<00:01:48.890> so<00:01:49.220> let's

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
talk about the courier right so let's

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.100 
talk about the courier right so let's
look<00:01:49.520> let's<00:01:49.820> try<00:01:50.330> to<00:01:50.390> guesstimate<00:01:50.900> with<00:01:51.020> the

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
look let's try to guesstimate with the

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.710 
look let's try to guesstimate with the
curry<00:01:51.350> saw<00:01:51.620> for<00:01:52.190> potato<00:01:52.790> wise<00:01:53.090> potato<00:01:53.570> our

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
curry saw for potato wise potato our

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.370 
curry saw for potato wise potato our
heads<00:01:53.900> you<00:01:54.049> can<00:01:54.200> see<00:01:54.350> potato<00:01:54.740> deep-fried<00:01:55.549> and

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
heads you can see potato deep-fried and

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.960 
heads you can see potato deep-fried and
some<00:01:57.380> pork<00:01:57.770> cutlet<00:01:58.159> right<00:01:58.280> here<00:01:58.430> deep-fried

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
some pork cutlet right here deep-fried

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.380 
some pork cutlet right here deep-fried
and<00:01:59.979> so<00:02:00.979> proteinwise<00:02:01.460> is<00:02:01.760> probably<00:02:02.090> i'm<00:02:02.360> a

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
and so proteinwise is probably i'm a

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.710 
and so proteinwise is probably i'm a
look<00:02:03.110> from<00:02:03.320> looking<00:02:03.710> at<00:02:03.830> it<00:02:04.360> protein<00:02:05.360> i<00:02:05.570> was

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
look from looking at it protein i was

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.259 
look from looking at it protein i was
saying<00:02:05.960> it's<00:02:06.049> about<00:02:06.260> 10<00:02:06.590> grams<00:02:07.119> again<00:02:08.119> it's

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
saying it's about 10 grams again it's

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.059 
saying it's about 10 grams again it's
probably<00:02:08.509> a<00:02:08.599> low<00:02:08.869> amount<00:02:09.409> but<00:02:09.709> then<00:02:09.830> again<00:02:09.920> i

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
probably a low amount but then again i

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:11.800 
probably a low amount but then again i
like<00:02:10.280> to<00:02:10.429> be<00:02:10.549> conservative<00:02:11.120> with<00:02:11.150> my<00:02:11.390> protein

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
like to be conservative with my protein

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.050 
like to be conservative with my protein
amount<00:02:12.080> or<00:02:12.400> guesstimating<00:02:13.400> macros<00:02:13.760> because<00:02:14.000> i

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
amount or guesstimating macros because i

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.490 
amount or guesstimating macros because i
know<00:02:14.120> that<00:02:14.360> a<00:02:14.390> lot<00:02:14.450> of<00:02:14.629> food<00:02:14.930> out<00:02:15.049> there<00:02:15.200> don't

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
know that a lot of food out there don't

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.369 
know that a lot of food out there don't
have<00:02:15.739> that<00:02:16.069> much<00:02:16.599> protein<00:02:17.599> content<00:02:18.170> so

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:18.379 
have that much protein content so

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.170 
have that much protein content so
proteinwise<00:02:18.950> all<00:02:19.250> things<00:02:19.430> about<00:02:19.580> 10<00:02:19.790> grams<00:02:20.030> of

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
proteinwise all things about 10 grams of

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.059 
proteinwise all things about 10 grams of
protein<00:02:20.860> carbs<00:02:21.860> wise<00:02:22.099> it's<00:02:22.520> about<00:02:23.110> 85<00:02:24.110> grams

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
protein carbs wise it's about 85 grams

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.209 
protein carbs wise it's about 85 grams
Oh<00:02:25.099> including<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:25.879> rice<00:02:26.439> fats<00:02:27.439> the<00:02:27.769> fats<00:02:28.010> is

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:28.219 
Oh including the rice fats the fats is

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:30.009 
Oh including the rice fats the fats is
what<00:02:28.340> we're<00:02:28.430> talking<00:02:28.700> about<00:02:28.760> right<00:02:28.879> fast<00:02:29.810> for

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
what we're talking about right fast for

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:31.330 
what we're talking about right fast for
this<00:02:30.139> meal<00:02:30.349> I<00:02:30.379> would<00:02:30.590> guesstimate<00:02:30.980> probably

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
this meal I would guesstimate probably

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.209 
this meal I would guesstimate probably
around<00:02:31.489> 25<00:02:32.180> twenties<00:02:32.810> I<00:02:32.900> believe<00:02:33.200> 28<00:02:33.920> grams

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:34.219 
around 25 twenties I believe 28 grams

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:36.429 
around 25 twenties I believe 28 grams
probably<00:02:34.730> about<00:02:34.849> 28<00:02:35.359> grams<00:02:35.569> 30<00:02:35.900> grams<00:02:36.139> of<00:02:36.290> fat

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:36.439 
probably about 28 grams 30 grams of fat

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:39.250 
probably about 28 grams 30 grams of fat
for<00:02:36.709> this<00:02:36.799> meal<00:02:37.069> is<00:02:37.099> correct<00:02:37.840> again<00:02:38.840> I<00:02:39.139> will

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
for this meal is correct again I will

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.830 
for this meal is correct again I will
add<00:02:39.530> that<00:02:39.560> to<00:02:39.799> my<00:02:39.859> My<00:02:40.280> Fitness<00:02:40.340> Pal<00:02:40.670> and<00:02:41.090> it

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
add that to my My Fitness Pal and it

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.640 
add that to my My Fitness Pal and it
just<00:02:42.260> throughout<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:42.680> day<00:02:42.889> and<00:02:43.389> how<00:02:44.389> do<00:02:44.450> I

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
just throughout the day and how do I

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.229 
just throughout the day and how do I
base<00:02:45.650> if<00:02:45.889> I<00:02:45.980> get<00:02:46.129> the<00:02:46.219> macro<00:02:46.519> summer<00:02:46.819> correct

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
base if I get the macro summer correct

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.179 
base if I get the macro summer correct
for<00:02:47.629> tomorrow<00:02:47.989> let's<00:02:48.319> say<00:02:48.409> tomorrow<00:02:48.469> I<00:02:48.889> gain

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:49.189 
for tomorrow let's say tomorrow I gain

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:51.580 
for tomorrow let's say tomorrow I gain
point<00:02:50.150> 2<00:02:50.359> pounds<00:02:50.810> maybe<00:02:50.989> or<00:02:51.230> something<00:02:51.500> along

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
point 2 pounds maybe or something along

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:52.959 
point 2 pounds maybe or something along
those<00:02:51.739> lines<00:02:51.829> and<00:02:52.099> I'm<00:02:52.159> pretty<00:02:52.400> fine<00:02:52.669> about<00:02:52.909> it

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:52.969 
those lines and I'm pretty fine about it

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:55.629 
those lines and I'm pretty fine about it
but<00:02:53.510> if<00:02:53.629> I<00:02:53.719> gained<00:02:53.959> about<00:02:54.079> a<00:02:54.200> pound<00:02:54.530> or<00:02:54.919> a<00:02:55.519> pound

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:55.639 
but if I gained about a pound or a pound

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:57.280 
but if I gained about a pound or a pound
and<00:02:55.969> a<00:02:56.060> half<00:02:56.090> then<00:02:56.689> I<00:02:56.840> know<00:02:56.900> that<00:02:57.169> my

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
and a half then I know that my

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.199 
and a half then I know that my
guesstimated<00:02:57.859> macros<00:02:58.189> for<00:02:58.219> this<00:02:58.549> meal<00:02:58.790> is<00:02:58.819> off

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
guesstimated macros for this meal is off

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.629 
guesstimated macros for this meal is off
so<00:03:00.109> that's<00:03:00.290> how<00:03:00.349> I<00:03:00.409> base<00:03:00.709> my<00:03:00.739> guesstimation

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:01.639 
so that's how I base my guesstimation

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:03.729 
so that's how I base my guesstimation
skill<00:03:01.819> guys<00:03:01.969> on<00:03:02.150> macros<00:03:02.510> that<00:03:02.569> is<00:03:02.870> so<00:03:03.500> again

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
skill guys on macros that is so again

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:04.990 
skill guys on macros that is so again
for<00:03:03.919> this<00:03:04.010> meal<00:03:04.250> I<00:03:04.280> would<00:03:04.459> guesstimate<00:03:04.790> around

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
for this meal I would guesstimate around

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.869 
for this meal I would guesstimate around
20<00:03:05.269> grams<00:03:05.569> of<00:03:05.719> fat<00:03:05.900> 10<00:03:06.769> grams<00:03:07.040> of<00:03:07.219> protein<00:03:07.400> and

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:07.879 
20 grams of fat 10 grams of protein and

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:11.740 
20 grams of fat 10 grams of protein and
I'll<00:03:08.480> say<00:03:08.629> about<00:03:08.719> 95<00:03:09.230> grams<00:03:09.500> of<00:03:09.650> carbs<00:03:09.980> hit<00:03:10.750> hit

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
I'll say about 95 grams of carbs hit hit

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.629 
I'll say about 95 grams of carbs hit hit
or<00:03:11.870> miss<00:03:11.900> there<00:03:12.590> you<00:03:12.739> go<00:03:12.859> and<00:03:13.159> for<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.400> rest<00:03:13.579> of

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:13.639 
or miss there you go and for the rest of

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:15.069 
or miss there you go and for the rest of
the<00:03:13.730> day<00:03:13.849> I'll<00:03:14.030> still<00:03:14.269> try<00:03:14.359> to<00:03:14.480> hit<00:03:14.599> my<00:03:14.689> macros

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
the day I'll still try to hit my macros

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:19.000 
the day I'll still try to hit my macros
of<00:03:15.290> total<00:03:15.680> 70<00:03:16.129> grams<00:03:16.280> of<00:03:16.489> fat<00:03:17.199> 165<00:03:18.199> protein<00:03:18.739> and

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
of total 70 grams of fat 165 protein and

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.459 
of total 70 grams of fat 165 protein and
400<00:03:19.939> grams<00:03:20.090> of<00:03:20.269> carbs<00:03:20.510> so<00:03:20.719> that's<00:03:21.379> basically

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:21.469 
400 grams of carbs so that's basically
