00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.070
 about it is a film that deals 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:27.490
 about a clairvoyant who by denying his gift 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.320
 ends up getting into a problem and 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.610
 ends up like creating in your head and 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.160
 that little by little he will have to 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.530
 disguised 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.720
 and that the only way out of that is 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.390
 Believing in your against you 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.060
 struck out is the best journalist director 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.160
 arrested after tradition 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:47.560
 is the person indicated with the 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.560
 creativity because all that passion 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:54.110
 I know you have this project of something 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.110
 seldom 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.019
 It is presented direct to you 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.510
 what does he want he knows perfectly 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:03.479
 how to take you in that place we have the 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.110
 peace vega as marta that is the seer 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:12.000
 johanna murillo as a mÃ³nica that her friend 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:15.260
 poncho herrera like mario we have maya 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.260
 shoe like the neighbor 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.330
 it was very pleasant and surprising to see that 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.610
 las vegas' have reached with the project 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.200
 so that this case she was not the 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.320
 first that said let's go for another or 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.540
 let's do it again 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.190
 until he comes out on a project like this 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.409
 more is driving in another captain the 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.970
 boat that 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.980
 I inspired 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:43.740
 activated the whole club to all 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:46.680
 actors to which people identify themselves 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.040
 with her I had empathy with this 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.040
 character 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.570
 the same character or the tragic one by 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.010
 guilt 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.520
 let's say by the weight of the guilt that 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:00.490
 load on his back then 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.899
 they are very guilty characters in all 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.530
 movies people who always have the 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:08.530
 option to leave or change however 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.709
 they always decide to get more we have 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:15.959
 they reached extremes and technical limits 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.959
 a super another could provide 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.810
 we all fall into the question what 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.359
 important is how fast can you 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.549
 lift and move on in this case 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:35.109
 for the character of Tuesday someone who 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.790
 he has to believe in himself to be able 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:37.730
 move on to where I like most in 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.670
 the movie 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.190
 how do you have a gift that nobody else has and 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.690
 you decide you do not believe in him because of a lot of fear 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.690
 I've had a movie 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:52.560
 precious experiences and everything but here 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.490
 there has been something that had not been lived 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.550
 never what is 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:00.840
 as a vital collective experience of 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.840
 good roll of good energy 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:07.580
 from all forward I do not know something very 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.140
 nice that has done that in four in 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.830
 five weeks 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:15.400
 let's take a movie 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:18.670
 a plane that has been left because everything 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.800
 characterized millimeter 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.099
 it is an effort of all and all 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.099
 we were 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.939
 is the joke was how to create a 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.950
 dense atmosphere that the department 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:36.310
 was a character by itself in the 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.440
 history 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.420
 it felt that the department will count 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.790
 other stories besides the sea 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:47.090
 is the department keeping my secret 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:50.540
 it's a movie they're always great 19 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:53.090
 They are thousands of pieces that have to marry 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.430
 and they have to 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.410
 and working together will have fun 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.239
 a lot on the way 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.970
 it's worth seeing the performance of this 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.680
 people are worth seeing the address of 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.239
 poncho and it's worth seeing the work of 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.069
 absolutely all the people who are 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.280
 here because I think they're going to make a big 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:09.280
 movie 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.090
 very hard 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.380
 and in the background is very beautiful and with a 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.650
 nice message so I hope everything 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.650
 go 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.470
 the next thing you do not miss spectrum 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.470
 thank you very much 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.409
 and 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.460
 pt percent
