00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
generation mx-5 and proportionally it's

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.120 
generation mx-5 and proportionally it's
going<00:00:30.210> back<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.779> first<00:00:31.080> generation<00:00:31.590> Miata

that came out in 1989 it's actually a

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.069 
that came out in 1989 it's actually a
little<00:00:35.160> bit<00:00:35.250> smaller<00:00:35.730> overall<00:00:36.420> but<00:00:36.960> the

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
little bit smaller overall but the

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.410 
little bit smaller overall but the
wheelbase<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.800> longer<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.790> it's<00:00:39.090> about<00:00:39.270> the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
wheelbase is longer and it's about the

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.670 
wheelbase is longer and it's about the
same<00:00:39.629> weight<00:00:39.870> I'll<00:00:39.989> get<00:00:40.110> into<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.440> when<00:00:40.649> we

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
same weight I'll get into that when we

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.410 
same weight I'll get into that when we
start<00:00:40.980> driving<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.579> but<00:00:41.969> what<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.239> notice

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
start driving it but what you notice

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.389 
start driving it but what you notice
right<00:00:42.780> away<00:00:42.840> it's<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.440> whole<00:00:43.770> new<00:00:44.129> direction

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
right away it's a whole new direction

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.840 
right away it's a whole new direction
for<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.090> mx-5<00:00:45.480> in<00:00:45.870> terms<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.620> design<00:00:47.039> now<00:00:47.640> when

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
for the mx-5 in terms of design now when

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.430 
for the mx-5 in terms of design now when
the<00:00:47.969> designers<00:00:48.480> were<00:00:48.629> talking<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.140> me<00:00:49.260> today

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
the designers were talking to me today

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.350 
the designers were talking to me today
they<00:00:49.680> were<00:00:49.739> saying<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.910> first<00:00:51.149> three

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
they were saying the the first three

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.810 
they were saying the the first three
generations<00:00:52.050> were<00:00:52.230> kind<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.530> an<00:00:53.010> evolution<00:00:53.309> of

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
generations were kind of an evolution of

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.970 
generations were kind of an evolution of
the<00:00:53.940> same<00:00:54.149> theme<00:00:54.480> basically<00:00:55.110> using<00:00:55.500> those<00:00:55.649> old

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
the same theme basically using those old

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.490 
the same theme basically using those old
English<00:00:56.550> roadsters<00:00:57.329> as<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.600> template<00:00:58.350> and

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
English roadsters as a template and

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.979 
English roadsters as a template and
making<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.250> Japanese<00:00:59.820> iteration<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.629> that

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
making a Japanese iteration of that

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.799 
making a Japanese iteration of that
classic<00:01:01.559> design<00:01:01.920> but<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.820> buyers<00:01:03.120> continue

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
classic design but the buyers continue

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.899 
classic design but the buyers continue
to<00:01:03.930> get<00:01:04.049> older<00:01:04.260> year<00:01:04.710> after<00:01:05.070> year<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:05.760> they're

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
to get older year after year so they're

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.219 
to get older year after year so they're
really<00:01:06.119> having<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.600> come<00:01:06.750> up<00:01:06.869> with<00:01:06.990> something

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
really having to come up with something

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.929 
really having to come up with something
a<00:01:07.380> little<00:01:07.470> bit<00:01:07.680> more<00:01:07.710> dynamic<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.549> appeal<00:01:08.909> to

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
you can push that forward and latch it

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.140 
you can push that forward and latch it
now<00:01:37.500> that's<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.829> beautiful<00:01:38.070> thing<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.640> you'll

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
also notice that there's quite a bit of

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.560 
also notice that there's quite a bit of
headroom<00:01:40.950> here<00:01:41.369> they<00:01:41.549> lowered<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.060> seat<00:01:42.360> by

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
headroom here they lowered the seat by

headroom here they lowered the seat by
two<00:01:42.710> centimeters<00:01:43.710> in<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:44.220> front<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.700> that

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
two centimeters in the front and that

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.420 
two centimeters in the front and that
provides<00:01:45.930> more<00:01:46.229> space<00:01:46.530> in<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.829> roof<00:01:47.040> they

provides more space in the roof they

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.010 
provides more space in the roof they
also<00:01:47.579> change<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.329> way<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.780> roof<00:01:48.930> is

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
also change the way that the roof is

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.569 
also change the way that the roof is
constructed<00:01:49.619> with<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.799> bars<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.340> they<00:01:50.399> moved

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
constructed with the bars and they moved

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.460 
constructed with the bars and they moved
something<00:01:50.820> forward<00:01:51.270> here<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:52.049> are<00:01:52.200> that

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
something forward here and that are that

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.950 
something forward here and that are that
allows<00:01:52.770> nine<00:01:53.250> millimeters<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.329> extra<00:01:54.659> space

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
allows nine millimeters of extra space

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.109 
allows nine millimeters of extra space
so<00:01:55.170> that's<00:01:55.649> definitely<00:01:56.159> welcome<00:01:56.340> also<00:01:56.969> the

so that's definitely welcome also the

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.240 
so that's definitely welcome also the
pitch<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.540> seat<00:01:57.810> goes<00:01:58.020> back<00:01:58.590> farther<00:01:58.950> now

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
pitch of the seat goes back farther now

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.490 
pitch of the seat goes back farther now

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
somewhere in the car but it's in here so

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.500 
somewhere in the car but it's in here so
that's<00:03:15.130> all<00:03:15.400> good<00:03:15.640> stuff<00:03:15.940> all<00:03:16.150> the<00:03:16.300> latest

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
that's all good stuff all the latest

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.050 
that's all good stuff all the latest
communications<00:03:17.430> navigation<00:03:18.430> is<00:03:18.550> standard<00:03:18.580> on

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
communications navigation is standard on

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.030 
communications navigation is standard on
the<00:03:19.180> middle<00:03:19.390> trim<00:03:19.630> and<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:20.260> top<00:03:20.470> trim<00:03:20.740> level

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
the middle trim and the top trim level

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.830 
the middle trim and the top trim level
so<00:03:21.160> this<00:03:21.520> is<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:21.850> way<00:03:21.970> I<00:03:22.000> think<00:03:22.180> most<00:03:22.360> people

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
so this is the way I think most people

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.420 
so this is the way I think most people
are<00:03:22.930> going<00:03:23.020> to<00:03:23.140> want<00:03:23.290> to<00:03:23.380> configure<00:03:23.830> this<00:03:23.950> car

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
are going to want to configure this car

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.490 
are going to want to configure this car
the<00:03:24.670> base<00:03:24.880> model<00:03:24.910> has<00:03:25.360> a<00:03:25.390> smaller<00:03:25.840> screen<00:03:25.960> and

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
the base model has a smaller screen and

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.740 
the base model has a smaller screen and
isn't<00:03:27.010> really<00:03:27.310> as<00:03:27.490> technologically<00:03:28.360> advanced

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
isn't really as technologically advanced

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.120 
isn't really as technologically advanced
even<00:03:28.960> though<00:03:29.020> all<00:03:29.170> trim<00:03:29.470> levels<00:03:29.500> do<00:03:29.950> get

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
even though all trim levels do get

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.000 
even though all trim levels do get
bluetooth<00:03:30.940> connectivity<00:03:31.600> then<00:03:32.500> you<00:03:32.650> get<00:03:32.800> into

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
bluetooth connectivity then you get into

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.220 
bluetooth connectivity then you get into
the<00:03:33.130> storage<00:03:33.550> they<00:03:34.000> say<00:03:34.270> this<00:03:34.480> car<00:03:34.720> is<00:03:34.840> bigger

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
the storage they say this car is bigger

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.930 
the storage they say this car is bigger
than<00:03:35.440> the<00:03:35.530> previous<00:03:35.680> model<00:03:36.460> even<00:03:36.760> though<00:03:36.820> the

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
than the previous model even though the

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.380 
than the previous model even though the
outside<00:03:37.300> dimensions<00:03:37.600> are<00:03:38.110> smaller<00:03:39.100> you<00:03:39.880> have

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
outside dimensions are smaller you have

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.330 
outside dimensions are smaller you have
the<00:03:40.660> steering<00:03:40.990> wheel<00:03:41.170> and<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:41.770> pedals<00:03:41.800> and

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
the steering wheel and the pedals and

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.190 
the steering wheel and the pedals and
everything<00:03:42.670> now<00:03:42.820> perfectly<00:03:43.630> lined<00:03:43.960> up

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
everything now perfectly lined up

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.410 
everything now perfectly lined up
previously<00:03:44.830> the<00:03:45.490> pedals<00:03:46.000> were<00:03:46.120> sort<00:03:46.360> of

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
previously the pedals were sort of

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.090 
previously the pedals were sort of
shifted<00:03:46.810> off<00:03:46.930> to<00:03:46.960> one<00:03:47.260> side<00:03:47.290> now<00:03:47.740> they've<00:03:47.950> gone

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
shifted off to one side now they've gone

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.800 
shifted off to one side now they've gone
right<00:03:48.370> in<00:03:48.880> the<00:03:48.970> middle<00:03:49.120> they've<00:03:49.360> moved<00:03:49.600> the

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
right in the middle they've moved the

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.080 
right in the middle they've moved the
driver's<00:03:50.230> seat<00:03:51.010> in<00:03:51.220> towards<00:03:51.640> the<00:03:51.790> middle<00:03:52.030> of

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
the car with the windshield brought back

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.470 
the car with the windshield brought back
it<00:03:54.340> gives<00:03:54.430> you<00:03:54.610> a<00:03:54.640> better<00:03:54.850> outward<00:03:55.330> visibility

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
it gives you a better outward visibility

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.900 
it gives you a better outward visibility
over<00:03:56.080> the<00:03:56.350> hood<00:03:56.530> and<00:03:56.710> down<00:03:56.980> the<00:03:57.190> road<00:03:57.370> it's

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
over the hood and down the road it's

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.460 
over the hood and down the road it's
very<00:03:58.240> simple<00:03:58.630> in<00:03:58.720> here<00:03:58.840> you<00:03:58.960> take<00:03:59.110> away<00:03:59.230> this

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
very simple in here you take away this

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.530 
very simple in here you take away this
communication<00:03:59.950> stuff<00:04:00.370> it's<00:04:00.820> still<00:04:01.000> a<00:04:01.150> very

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
communication stuff it's still a very

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.410 
communication stuff it's still a very
simple<00:04:02.170> clean<00:04:02.530> easy<00:04:02.860> execution<00:04:03.850> of<00:04:04.000> a

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
simple clean easy execution of a

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.270 
simple clean easy execution of a
roadster<00:04:04.810> and<00:04:04.990> that's<00:04:05.140> really<00:04:05.440> what<00:04:05.710> matters

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
roadster and that's really what matters

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.670 
roadster and that's really what matters
it's<00:04:06.730> all<00:04:06.970> about<00:04:07.300> the<00:04:07.540> driver<00:04:07.840> in<00:04:08.080> the<00:04:08.170> car<00:04:08.410> and

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
it's all about the driver in the car and

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:16.140 
it's all about the driver in the car and
going<00:04:08.980> down<00:04:09.190> the<00:04:09.340> road<00:04:09.460> and<00:04:09.520> having<00:04:09.820> fun

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.390 

now<00:04:16.690> the<00:04:16.750> reason<00:04:17.229> why<00:04:17.410> this<00:04:17.470> isn't<00:04:17.949> a<00:04:18.130> chick

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
now the reason why this isn't a chick

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.430 
now the reason why this isn't a chick
car<00:04:18.609> never<00:04:18.940> has<00:04:19.209> been<00:04:19.540> is<00:04:19.780> because<00:04:19.959> it's<00:04:20.320> the

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
car never has been is because it's the

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.260 
car never has been is because it's the
proper<00:04:20.889> setup<00:04:21.270> front-engine

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
proper setup front-engine

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.840 
proper setup front-engine

much fun to drive it's got the right
sound<00:04:29.800> you<00:04:30.430> point<00:04:30.699> it<00:04:30.729> where<00:04:30.910> you<00:04:30.970> want<00:04:31.150> it<00:04:31.210> to

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
sound you point it where you want it to

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.570 
sound you point it where you want it to
go<00:04:31.540> and<00:04:31.810> it<00:04:31.930> does<00:04:32.080> it<00:04:32.229> all<00:04:32.410> perfectly<00:04:32.919> and<00:04:33.280> with

go and it does it all perfectly and with

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.550 
go and it does it all perfectly and with
this<00:04:33.729> latest<00:04:34.090> fourth<00:04:34.479> generation<00:04:35.139> they've

this latest fourth generation they've

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.469 
this latest fourth generation they've
taken<00:04:35.860> everything<00:04:36.280> and<00:04:36.610> they've<00:04:36.699> amped<00:04:37.210> it<00:04:37.330> up

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
taken everything and they've amped it up

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:40.379 
taken everything and they've amped it up
so<00:04:38.169> under<00:04:38.440> the<00:04:38.530> hood<00:04:38.560> is<00:04:38.919> a<00:04:38.949> 2-liter<00:04:39.520> SKYACTIV

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389
