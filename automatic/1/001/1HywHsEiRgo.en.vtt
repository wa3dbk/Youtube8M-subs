sheath is glass reinforced nylon so it

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.580

separately<00:02:26.330> I've<00:02:27.330> used<00:02:27.450> this<00:02:27.690> knife<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:28.140> lot

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
separately I've used this knife a lot

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.340 
separately I've used this knife a lot
for<00:02:29.430> Abbott<00:02:29.700> awning<00:02:30.209> and<00:02:30.480> hacking<00:02:31.049> it<00:02:31.140> would

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
for Abbott awning and hacking it would

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.550 
for Abbott awning and hacking it would
and<00:02:31.830> but<00:02:32.640> not<00:02:32.819> too<00:02:33.090> great<00:02:33.390> outdoors<00:02:34.019> knives<00:02:34.350> in

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.039 
and but not too great outdoors knives in
my<00:02:34.590> opinion<00:02:35.269> it's<00:02:36.269> a<00:02:36.360> whole<00:02:36.540> quarter<00:02:36.900> of<00:02:36.959> an

my opinion it's a whole quarter of an
inch<00:02:37.110> thick<00:02:37.489> which<00:02:38.489> is<00:02:38.640> nice<00:02:38.819> and<00:02:39.560> similar<00:02:40.560> to

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
inch thick which is nice and similar to
