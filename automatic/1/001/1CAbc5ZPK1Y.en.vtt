that's where the fan will go anyway the

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.430 
that's where the fan will go anyway the
pots<00:02:32.060> put<00:02:32.330> this<00:02:32.420> all<00:02:32.540> together<00:02:32.660> and<00:02:32.990> my

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
pots put this all together and my

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.390 
pots put this all together and my
soldering<00:02:33.860> iron<00:02:34.480> took<00:02:35.480> a<00:02:35.540> crap<00:02:35.780> so<00:02:36.200> I<00:02:36.530> had<00:02:37.250> to

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
soldering iron took a crap so I had to

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.080 
soldering iron took a crap so I had to
use<00:02:38.500> just<00:02:39.500> crimps<00:02:40.160> and<00:02:40.280> splices<00:02:40.730> for<00:02:40.940> right

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
use just crimps and splices for right

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.950 
use just crimps and splices for right
now<00:02:41.260> but<00:02:42.910> and<00:02:43.910> the<00:02:44.000> binding<00:02:44.300> posts<00:02:44.600> on<00:02:44.690> it<00:02:44.810> I

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
now but and the binding posts on it I

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.020 
now but and the binding posts on it I
got<00:02:45.140> from<00:02:45.440> fries<00:02:45.710> which<00:02:46.040> were<00:02:46.190> cheap<00:02:46.430> again

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
got from fries which were cheap again

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.720 
got from fries which were cheap again
like<00:02:47.480> $2.99<00:02:47.810> but<00:02:48.770> they<00:02:48.920> fit<00:02:49.100> the<00:02:49.190> bill<00:02:49.340> perfect

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
like $2.99 but they fit the bill perfect

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.540 
like $2.99 but they fit the bill perfect
but<00:02:49.880> as<00:02:50.000> you<00:02:50.120> can<00:02:50.210> see<00:02:50.270> they're<00:02:50.630> not<00:02:50.750> insulated

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
but as you can see they're not insulated

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.360 
but as you can see they're not insulated
right<00:02:52.550> there<00:02:52.790> so<00:02:53.090> I<00:02:53.420> thought<00:02:54.410> oh<00:02:54.710> no<00:02:55.070> what<00:02:55.250> am<00:02:55.340> I

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
going to do it's if it hits chassis but

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.760 
going to do it's if it hits chassis but
also<00:02:59.030> at<00:02:59.420> Fry's<00:02:59.750> you<00:02:59.990> can<00:03:00.140> find<00:03:00.320> everything<00:03:00.530> at

just perfect for the diameter of the

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.440 
just perfect for the diameter of the
post<00:03:18.460> so<00:03:19.460> I<00:03:19.490> just<00:03:19.670> opened<00:03:20.030> these<00:03:20.150> up<00:03:20.330> a<00:03:20.420> little

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
post so I just opened these up a little

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.170 
post so I just opened these up a little
bit<00:03:20.840> more<00:03:21.070> and<00:03:23.590> pop<00:03:24.590> that<00:03:24.850> grommet<00:03:25.850> thing<00:03:26.030> in

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
bit more and pop that grommet thing in

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.450 
bit more and pop that grommet thing in
there<00:03:26.390> and<00:03:26.590> then<00:03:27.590> ran<00:03:27.800> the<00:03:27.950> post<00:03:28.130> through<00:03:28.400> it

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:28.460 
there and then ran the post through it

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:33.550 
there and then ran the post through it
tighten<00:03:29.270> down<00:03:29.300> the<00:03:29.830> nuts<00:03:31.780> worked<00:03:32.780> awesome<00:03:32.960> all

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
tighten down the nuts worked awesome all

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.470 
tighten down the nuts worked awesome all
right<00:03:33.620> so<00:03:35.140> my<00:03:36.140> 12<00:03:36.410> volt<00:03:36.590> line<00:03:36.770> here<00:03:37.220> well<00:03:37.910> I

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
right so my 12 volt line here well I

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.970 
right so my 12 volt line here well I
think<00:03:38.630> there's<00:03:38.900> four<00:03:38.930> wires<00:03:39.380> bundled

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
think there's four wires bundled

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.670 
think there's four wires bundled
together<00:03:40.130> they're<00:03:40.570> four<00:03:41.570> wires<00:03:41.810> from<00:03:42.470> what

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
together they're four wires from what

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.650 
together they're four wires from what
everyone<00:03:43.010> says<00:03:43.280> on<00:03:43.550> the<00:03:43.940> forums<00:03:44.330> and<00:03:44.570> on

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
everyone says on the forums and on

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.750 
everyone says on the forums and on
YouTube<00:03:45.230> videos<00:03:45.500> that<00:03:46.100> should<00:03:46.310> be<00:03:46.400> enough<00:03:46.610> to

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
YouTube videos that should be enough to

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.240 
YouTube videos that should be enough to
handle<00:03:47.030> the<00:03:47.150> amperage<00:03:47.890> you<00:03:48.890> know<00:03:49.010> I'm<00:03:49.130> not

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
handle the amperage you know I'm not

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.950 
handle the amperage you know I'm not
going<00:03:49.430> to<00:03:49.490> charge<00:03:49.700> anything<00:03:49.970> higher<00:03:50.930> than

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:50.960 
going to charge anything higher than

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.100 
going to charge anything higher than
probably<00:03:51.860> 5<00:03:52.070> amps<00:03:52.460> you<00:03:52.700> know<00:03:52.820> here's<00:03:53.030> the<00:03:53.110> like

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
probably 5 amps you know here's the like

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.990 
probably 5 amps you know here's the like
you<00:03:54.260> saw<00:03:54.410> six<00:03:54.710> that<00:03:54.860> I've<00:03:54.980> picked<00:03:55.220> up<00:03:55.370> to<00:03:55.850> do

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
you saw six that I've picked up to do

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.710 
you saw six that I've picked up to do
the<00:03:56.120> charging<00:03:56.800> so<00:03:57.880> I'm<00:03:58.880> not<00:03:59.030> going<00:03:59.180> to<00:03:59.330> put<00:03:59.690> a

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
the charging so I'm not going to put a

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.820 
the charging so I'm not going to put a
huge<00:04:00.020> amp<00:04:00.260> draw<00:04:00.410> on<00:04:00.620> this<00:04:00.740> anyway<00:04:01.100> so<00:04:02.560> so<00:04:03.560> four

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
huge amp draw on this anyway so so four

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.250 
huge amp draw on this anyway so so four
four<00:04:04.430> wires<00:04:04.640> bundle<00:04:05.060> together<00:04:05.180> work<00:04:06.050> just

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
four wires bundle together work just

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.750 
four wires bundle together work just
fine<00:04:06.500> same<00:04:06.830> thing<00:04:07.040> on<00:04:07.160> the<00:04:07.220> ground<00:04:07.460> there<00:04:07.730> are

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
fine same thing on the ground there are

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.800 
fine same thing on the ground there are
four<00:04:08.000> wires<00:04:08.210> hooked<00:04:08.990> up<00:04:09.230> there<00:04:10.390> the<00:04:11.390> only

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
four wires hooked up there the only

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:18.220 
four wires hooked up there the only
thing<00:04:12.080> left<00:04:12.290> to<00:04:12.440> do<00:04:12.740> is<00:04:14.110> oh<00:04:15.130> so<00:04:16.570> the<00:04:17.570> green<00:04:17.870> out

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
thing left to do is oh so the green out

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.390 
thing left to do is oh so the green out
of<00:04:18.530> the<00:04:18.739> 24<00:04:19.460> pin<00:04:19.960> connector<00:04:20.960> the<00:04:21.859> green<00:04:22.130> is

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
of the 24 pin connector the green is

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.129 
of the 24 pin connector the green is
your<00:04:22.880> power<00:04:23.150> on

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
your power on

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:25.929 
your power on
signal<00:04:24.949> from<00:04:25.250> that<00:04:25.520> comes<00:04:25.699> from<00:04:25.819> the

00:04:25.929 --> 00:04:25.939 
signal from that comes from the

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:28.649 
signal from that comes from the
motherboard<00:04:26.240> switch<00:04:26.750> right<00:04:27.229> so<00:04:28.009> what<00:04:28.189> you<00:04:28.340> do

00:04:28.649 --> 00:04:28.659 
motherboard switch right so what you do

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:32.110 
motherboard switch right so what you do
when<00:04:29.659> you<00:04:29.750> would<00:04:29.930> press<00:04:30.169> the<00:04:30.199> power<00:04:30.979> key<00:04:31.120> or

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
when you would press the power key or

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.339 
when you would press the power key or
the<00:04:32.150> power<00:04:32.389> button<00:04:32.840> on<00:04:32.960> the<00:04:33.050> front<00:04:33.169> of<00:04:33.259> the

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:33.349 
the power button on the front of the

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:35.920 
the power button on the front of the
case<00:04:33.530> it<00:04:33.740> would<00:04:33.849> you<00:04:34.849> know<00:04:34.969> short<00:04:35.419> that<00:04:35.599> that

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
case it would you know short that that

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.709 
case it would you know short that that
circuit<00:04:36.550> so<00:04:37.550> what<00:04:38.000> I've<00:04:38.090> done<00:04:38.240> is<00:04:38.300> I've<00:04:38.509> just

00:04:38.709 --> 00:04:38.719 
circuit so what I've done is I've just

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:40.540 
circuit so what I've done is I've just
spliced<00:04:39.020> together<00:04:39.229> the<00:04:39.680> green<00:04:39.919> and<00:04:40.159> one

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
spliced together the green and one

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.809 
spliced together the green and one
ground<00:04:40.969> out<00:04:41.780> of<00:04:41.840> the<00:04:41.990> multitude<00:04:42.919> of<00:04:43.099> ground

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:43.819 
ground out of the multitude of ground

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:46.300 
ground out of the multitude of ground
wires<00:04:44.060> we<00:04:44.240> had<00:04:44.389> here<00:04:44.680> just<00:04:45.680> splice<00:04:46.189> them

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
wires we had here just splice them

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.719 
wires we had here just splice them
together<00:04:47.919> so<00:04:48.919> they'll<00:04:49.069> take<00:04:49.219> care<00:04:49.280> of<00:04:49.460> it

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 
together so they'll take care of it

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
going to try this

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.529 
going to try this
check<00:04:55.669> your<00:04:55.939> your<00:04:56.810> connector<00:04:57.409> and<00:04:58.360> where<00:04:59.360> is

00:04:59.529 --> 00:04:59.539 
check your your connector and where is

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:03.040 
check your your connector and where is
that<00:04:59.840> guy<00:05:00.789> okay<00:05:01.789> so<00:05:02.120> right<00:05:02.330> here<00:05:02.360> on<00:05:02.750> the<00:05:02.870> edge

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
that guy okay so right here on the edge

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:13.380 
that guy okay so right here on the edge
I<00:05:03.909> can<00:05:04.909> get<00:05:05.029> that<00:05:05.150> to<00:05:05.300> focus

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.390 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.200 

great<00:05:14.390> video<00:05:14.690> making<00:05:14.930> kinda<00:05:15.350> okay<00:05:16.220> so<00:05:17.000> you<00:05:17.060> can

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
great video making kinda okay so you can

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.110 
great video making kinda okay so you can
see<00:05:17.320> in<00:05:18.320> one<00:05:18.590> pin<00:05:18.860> you<00:05:19.250> had<00:05:19.400> the<00:05:19.520> brown<00:05:19.730> and<00:05:20.000> the

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
see in one pin you had the brown and the

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.930 
see in one pin you had the brown and the

put<00:05:36.620> those<00:05:37.130> together<00:05:37.370> as<00:05:37.730> well<00:05:37.940> so<00:05:38.240> I've<00:05:38.330> got

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:38.480 
put those together as well so I've got

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.120 
put those together as well so I've got
the<00:05:38.600> brown<00:05:38.810> and<00:05:38.960> the<00:05:39.020> orange<00:05:39.380> spliced

splice together and I'll probably come

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.850 
splice together and I'll probably come
back<00:05:45.530> and<00:05:45.680> solder<00:05:46.520> these<00:05:46.730> when<00:05:46.940> I<00:05:46.970> get<00:05:47.150> a

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
back and solder these when I get a

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:53.890

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:29.540 
to solder in this is why you have to go

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.260 
to solder in this is why you have to go
get<00:06:29.690> the<00:06:29.780> soldering<00:06:30.080> gun<00:06:30.729> you<00:06:31.729> need<00:06:31.910> to<00:06:32.000> solder

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:32.270 
get the soldering gun you need to solder

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:37.390 
get the soldering gun you need to solder

will<00:06:37.610> have<00:06:37.729> this<00:06:37.910> it<00:06:38.150> was<00:06:38.180> like<00:06:38.270> 99<00:06:38.870> cents<00:06:39.169> I

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:39.380 
will have this it was like 99 cents I

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:44.290 
will have this it was like 99 cents I
don't<00:06:40.340> have<00:06:40.490> it<00:06:40.640> handy<00:06:40.910> right<00:06:41.090> now<00:06:41.240> but<00:06:43.180> it's<00:06:44.180> a

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:44.300 
don't have it handy right now but it's a

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.270 
don't have it handy right now but it's a
10<00:06:44.510> watt<00:06:44.750> resistor<00:06:45.440> one<00:06:46.220> point<00:06:46.520> 5<00:06:46.820> ohms<00:06:47.180> okay

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.280 
10 watt resistor one point 5 ohms okay

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:53.219 
10 watt resistor one point 5 ohms okay
so<00:06:49.280> it's<00:06:49.520> a<00:06:49.760> 1.5<00:06:50.660> ohm<00:06:50.840> resistance<00:06:51.350> 10<00:06:52.100> watts<00:06:52.370> of

00:06:53.219 --> 00:06:53.229 
so it's a 1.5 ohm resistance 10 watts of

00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:54.490 
so it's a 1.5 ohm resistance 10 watts of
power

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:54.500 
power

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.250 
power
so<00:06:55.220> you<00:06:55.310> just<00:06:55.490> solder<00:06:55.729> one<00:06:56.090> of<00:06:56.210> those<00:06:56.360> in<00:06:56.570> with

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:57.260 
so you just solder one of those in with

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.110 
so you just solder one of those in with
