00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.450
 first of October and the new chief 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.519
 commercial office from Italy under the 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.689
 marsili can show us this new one 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.160
 offer of skip on certainly this is 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.000
 the inauguration of a turning point 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.860
 commercial 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.189
 the goal we want with this 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:28.800
 offer is to create a vicenza a 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.110
 approach to with our clients 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.550
 let me explain better the customer is not a 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.250
 genetic customer is a customer 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.040
 individual is a customer that allows us 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.200
 to us all to be close to understanding 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.180
 his needs and starting from his 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.520
 needs with the needs of us 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.010
 we reach a specific offer for a 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.020
 specific customer the customer is not a 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.150
 geometric client is an individual one 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.040
 person who has needs and on 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.010
 based on this we create our offer 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.960
 the female and this we identify the 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.160
 needs today, as today, more and more 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.670
 families have difficulty staying 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.950
 together 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.110
 the goal is to allow through 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.880
 italy to have a time with the two 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.560
 triple and with families 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.320
 a time that allows us and for mini 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.050
 from families 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.100
 to be together having fun at a 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.370
 affordable price 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.970
 but with good and qualitative services 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.820
 of alitalia 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.369
 and it is here that the female phenomena is born 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.200
 which allows you to do weekends 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.360
 fast with your family with a 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.780
 qualitative time to stay two nights 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.310
 outside however it has an affordable price of 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.080
 a nice affordable price because 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.350
 obviously has always had Italy 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:39.400
 those opportunities to have services 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:42.729
 unique and exclusive allowing also a 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:48.250
 the element of transparency with i 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:50.649
 our doctor mazzini who are 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.869
 goals you set yourself of 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.060
 realize in the immediate future in 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.600
 alitalia 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.820
 here is an element of descriptiveness 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.259
 the goal is to make discontinuity 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.090
 the goal is to search through 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.130
 international experience in the market 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.009
 international to create 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.660
 an organization aimed at 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.820
 discontinuity and when they want 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.060
 discontinuity around a little what 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.500
 anticipated to stay close to the customer 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.990
 getting close to crime 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.580
 customer needs change would like 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.640
 build a targeted organization 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:27.150
 no need to enter the customer's needs 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.520
 on the merits for this because why today 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.890
 always those who enter the superuser of 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.650
 services is increasingly evident that 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.480
 demanding because he knows and therefore 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.060
 necessarily an organization must 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.010
 finalize this to be able to 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.550
 stay close to the customer's needs 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.090
 of the customer 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:47.280
 in particular I express myself even more in 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.630
 detail an organization 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.880
 will get closer and closer but 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.950
 the organization of tito and when 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.690
 let's talk about rigid is a world of super 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.030
 josÃ© people who know exactly 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.560
 what then will they be surfing in 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.020
 horse racing world that is not 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.780
 exclusively the web but we have to give 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:07.290
 the answers both on the web and apparently 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.840
 smart both in tablets and in particular to 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.400
 social network people who are there 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.709
 they approach our organizations 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.650
 through these channels and we have to 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:19.160
 always be important for one 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.840
 company like yours succeed in 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.870
 to capture travelers that normally 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.290
 will want this is not an element 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.780
 important and is one of the motivations of 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.239
 some born this look friends 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.000
 find out what those customers are 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:38.870
 not good today 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.630
 or they still have more needs than maybe 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.060
 once a year they raise with us and 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.950
 identify instead with them 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.020
 how can we help you negotiate a little 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.570
 more with us and the female another 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:53.390
 once a response to this need from 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.580
 our part and they will give them 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.140
 the opportunity to travel with us by 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.510
 traveling with us has a fair price 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.840
 for which we will certainly make a 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.620
 service as you have other initiatives of 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.570
 this kind of future planning 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:11.180
 certainly yes this is a very good one 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.459
 a new season or commercial a 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.500
 goal we don't want to be in 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:19.160
 market we want to be close to minds 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:21.200
 and create ad hoc products for the needs 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.460
 of our nothing and it is this only 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.450
 that there will be a very short time later 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.300
 I'd like to add one more 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.950
 fundamental element that I express myself 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.820
 directly 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:36.940
 possible we are a company today 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.620
 we have had a difficult time here 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.920
 organized 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:44.620
 today we have rebuilt the target from 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.180
 only create this discontinuity are 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.960
 a few days that I'm just big 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:53.260
 but I would still like to give evidence 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.200
 further hand the organization that 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.080
 I can motive 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.960
 the new commercial structure will have a 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.990
 a fundamental element of my client 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.300
 this is medial because if there is 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.680
 will be someone who will think that there is 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:11.080
 something more important than the customer 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.080
 I'll invite him again, he thought it over
