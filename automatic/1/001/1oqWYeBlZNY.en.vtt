00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
good things about this wheel we actually

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.870 
good things about this wheel we actually
bought<00:00:12.210> four<00:00:12.840> of<00:00:13.110> these<00:00:13.290> for<00:00:13.920> some<00:00:14.400> classes

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
bought four of these for some classes

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.090 
bought four of these for some classes
that<00:00:14.910> I<00:00:15.120> was<00:00:15.269> teaching<00:00:15.690> our<00:00:16.289> local<00:00:16.680> museum

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
that I was teaching our local museum

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.269 
that I was teaching our local museum
here<00:00:18.350> the<00:00:19.350> reason<00:00:19.529> we<00:00:19.740> bought<00:00:19.920> them<00:00:20.160> is

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
here the reason we bought them is

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.000 
here the reason we bought them is
because<00:00:20.550> they<00:00:20.699> were<00:00:20.930> almost<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.529> cheapest

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
because they were almost the cheapest

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.269 
because they were almost the cheapest
new<00:00:23.910> wheel<00:00:24.180> that<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.420> can<00:00:24.689> buy<00:00:24.869> on<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.230> market

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
new wheel that you can buy on the market

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.410 
new wheel that you can buy on the market
if<00:00:26.279> not<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.119> cheapest<00:00:27.570> but<00:00:28.580> they're<00:00:29.580> super

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
if not the cheapest but they're super

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.650 
if not the cheapest but they're super
light<00:00:30.599> super<00:00:31.080> portable<00:00:32.090> and<00:00:33.090> we<00:00:33.329> don't<00:00:33.510> have<00:00:33.630> a

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
light super portable and we don't have a

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.000 
light super portable and we don't have a
permanent<00:00:34.100> pottery<00:00:35.100> space<00:00:35.399> at<00:00:35.670> our<00:00:36.000> museum<00:00:36.450> so

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
even put them on fairly rickety card

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.840 
even put them on fairly rickety card
tables<00:00:44.690> or<00:00:45.690> like<00:00:45.960> banquet<00:00:46.950> type<00:00:47.190> tables<00:00:47.610> that

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
great as you can see some of the

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.170 
great as you can see some of the
features<00:00:52.710> here<00:00:54.620> were<00:00:55.620> closer<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.670> it

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
features here were closer this is a it

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.689 
features here were closer this is a it
comes<00:00:57.390> with<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.660> couple<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:58.109> removable<00:00:59.010> bats<00:00:59.370> so

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
comes with a couple of removable bats so

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.400 
comes with a couple of removable bats so
you<00:00:59.760> can<00:00:59.940> take<00:01:00.120> your<00:01:00.359> pottery<00:01:00.690> off<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:01.050> mean

obviously you can see this wheel is well
used<00:01:04.010> there's<00:01:05.010> good<00:01:05.400> reason<00:01:05.760> for<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:06.030> because

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
used there's good reason for it because

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.039 
used there's good reason for it because
it's<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.600> workhorse<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.350> has<00:01:08.220> this<00:01:08.549> nice

first bought this wheel I've seen those
little<00:02:40.040> toy<00:02:40.370> wheels<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:42.230> it<00:02:42.440> seems<00:02:42.650> like

I I was demonstrating that and I left it
unlocked<00:04:45.680> but<00:04:46.680> see<00:04:46.979> that<00:04:47.190> I<00:04:47.220> mean<00:04:47.460> just<00:04:47.639> a

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
dream to throw with the speed control is

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.180 
dream to throw with the speed control is
really<00:04:51.960> great<00:04:52.169> because<00:04:52.350> you<00:04:52.590> can<00:04:52.740> go<00:04:52.860> all<00:04:53.010> the

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
really great because you can go all the

really great because you can go all the
way<00:04:53.220> down<00:04:54.199> in<00:04:55.199> some<00:04:55.530> ways<00:04:55.710> this<00:04:55.889> has<00:04:55.949> better

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
way down in some ways this has better

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.980 
way down in some ways this has better
control<00:04:56.550> than<00:04:57.000> some<00:04:57.270> of<00:04:57.389> the<00:04:57.479> really
