00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.840
 very good everyone today we always have a 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.370
 day more with all of you and in this 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.200
 I have come to talk about the system 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.269
 of leagues of the league of legends the trans 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.980
 famous system that is the system that 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.530
 We currently have in the ico player 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.570
 to position ourselves in a position u 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.010
 other depending on our system of 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.410
 game in run games that are 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.449
 qualifiers as we already know it 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.830
 composed of different leagues and each one 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.230
 of these leagues because it has different 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.029
 divisions I make this video because it's going to 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.070
 see a few small changes in this 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.960
 system since good from my point of 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.150
 seen and from the point of view of 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.440
 several players because we understand that 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.540
 there was a small problem that 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.760
 surely if you are a regular player of 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.270
 rank ets as you have already noticed and 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.030
 noticed why and is that currently in 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.129
 the system as it is right now 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.350
 there is a small problem with certain 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.120
 players who are independently 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.040
 of the day it be either bronze silver gold 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.710
 whatever but division 5 in the 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.629
 damn division is one that is 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.219
 really bad not because it can be that 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.170
 are you ayo because you just ascended the 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.729
 which can motivate you to play but 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.589
 You may also be there because 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:06.390
 star has given and you have come down and as in 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.430
 that division you will not be able to lower in the 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.460
 life whatever you do you believe what 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.560
 you want to lose 10 thousand games in a row 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.630
 you can do exactly what you want 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.810
 that we're going to lower never except that 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.330
 You are inactive for 28 days, which is what 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.860
 marks the current system that you can 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.110
 go down for inactivity is to say yes no 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.420
 you play in 28 days they lower you if you play 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.690
 but you lose or whatever they are not going to 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.420
 never get down this they will change it and what 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.520
 what they are going to do is download the players 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.560
 because it is clear that here this 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.659
 it represented many trolls many people 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.240
 weird and you have to change this you have to 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.860
 change this because it is unfeasible and what 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.409
 they're going to do is when you meet 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.000
 in a division 5 of which you think 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.430
 that you can not download with the new system 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.530
 that will be incorporated when it ends 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.810
 season 3 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.729
 approximately 4 days for which it is already 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.860
 good that people go informing and 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.979
 knowing this when you are with 0 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.240
 points in a division 5 and lose a 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.430
 large number of games that 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.970
 approximately it will be about 10 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.310
 departures then if you are in division 50 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.640
 points and you want 10 games you will be able to 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.220
 lose league is to say if you are in silver 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.830
 5 and lose 10 games in a row with zero 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.600
 points you will go down to bronze 1 thing that 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.390
 currently you can not but with the 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.890
 new change, yes, which I think 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.209
 it's pretty good to avoid certain 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.830
 trophies of people who are not interested 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.290
 will go up in league or nothing but just 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.700
 troll and when it reached the point in 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.940
 that they considered that they were already 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.430
 well another important change is that it's going 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.370
 to get more league points less bad 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.890
 this is going to be implemented at all 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.340
 divisions and leagues inferior to diamond 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.800
 one many times or it's a league for 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.440
 the pole for example the divisions 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.570
 some of each league in which then 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.790
 to go up to the top league you had to 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.890
 go playing many games because 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.600
 we have very few points for victories 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.810
 four or five points six points 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.060
 even 10 points this is going to change 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.920
 they are going to start giving more points 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.350
 simply according to said network for 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.480
 have a little more the feeling of 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.920
 progression what you go forward is not what 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.989
 same play the game say good I'll 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.650
 to play four points that win 20 and 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:24.650
 follow another 5 then maybe they talk to us 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.410
 maybe they put me promotion not and she'll 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.390
 motivates a little more this as I say is going 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.680
 to make diamond one down from 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.630
 diamond one up will follow 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.100
 same because they have to be sure of 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.950
 that players who come to 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.570
 challenger as they are gaining few points 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.390
 and such to play many games and that 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.680
 really should be in challenger 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.810
 referring to the challenger also goes 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.239
 to have a small change and it's not going 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.269
 to be a level of 100 points but it's going 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.890
 to be a level of 200 points is going to 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:55.069
 increase a little 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.910
 so that they occupy a little more people 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:59.280
 Challenger squares 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.100
 and I just think that he left me nothing 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.690
 more I hope that they have helped you or so 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:07.350
 unless you are aware of these changes 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:11.940
 remember very briefly that if you are in 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:14.460
 a league with a division 50 points if 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.220
 you lose a few games in a row 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:19.620
 approximately 10 currently after 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.540
 of season 3 you will be able to go down to 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:25.050
 a lower league so you have to have 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:27.330
 quite careful since those can 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.370
 fuck well fucked and nothing more than 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.560
 comment I hope we'll see how everything goes 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.660
 this this that we will earn more points 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.940
 for victory we will see how many points they give 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:40.220
 now and nothing this will be all I hope that 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.220
 you liked a greeting and see you later
