00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:26.770 
before I get started with a master class

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.470 
before I get started with a master class
I<00:00:27.160> would<00:00:27.610> like<00:00:27.760> to<00:00:27.820> give<00:00:28.150> you<00:00:28.180> a<00:00:28.300> little

I would like to give you a little

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.570 
I would like to give you a little
background<00:00:28.870> information<00:00:29.410> about<00:00:30.100> the<00:00:30.280> picture

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580 
background information about the picture

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.880 
background information about the picture
we're<00:00:30.730> looking<00:00:31.030> at<00:00:31.150> today<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:32.380> is<00:00:32.529> probably

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
we're looking at today it is probably

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.430 
we're looking at today it is probably
not<00:00:33.040> a<00:00:33.100> very<00:00:33.220> spectacular<00:00:33.700> picture<00:00:34.660> but<00:00:35.290> the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
not a very spectacular picture but the

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.770 
not a very spectacular picture but the
job<00:00:35.680> was<00:00:35.710> kind<00:00:36.250> of<00:00:36.310> challenging<00:00:37.120> because<00:00:37.450> the

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
job was kind of challenging because the

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.020 
job was kind of challenging because the
room<00:00:38.080> I<00:00:38.320> was<00:00:38.530> shooting<00:00:38.770> in<00:00:39.100> was<00:00:39.340> very<00:00:39.580> limited

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
room I was shooting in was very limited

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.900 
room I was shooting in was very limited
in<00:00:40.120> space<00:00:40.480> so<00:00:41.350> I<00:00:41.380> only<00:00:41.680> had<00:00:42.010> one<00:00:42.280> position<00:00:42.730> for

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
in space so I only had one position for

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.690 
in space so I only had one position for
the<00:00:43.000> camera<00:00:43.450> and<00:00:43.720> I<00:00:44.470> did<00:00:44.650> not<00:00:44.800> have<00:00:45.040> much<00:00:45.310> space

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:45.700 
the camera and I did not have much space

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.170 
the camera and I did not have much space
for<00:00:46.030> lighting<00:00:46.630> equipment<00:00:47.730> basically<00:00:48.730> I<00:00:48.760> knew

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
for lighting equipment basically I knew

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.569 
for lighting equipment basically I knew
that<00:00:49.450> I<00:00:49.630> had<00:00:49.930> to<00:00:49.960> create<00:00:50.350> the<00:00:50.770> ambience<00:00:51.340> and

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
that I had to create the ambience and

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:53.819 
that I had to create the ambience and
the<00:00:51.790> atmosphere<00:00:52.329> of<00:00:52.420> the<00:00:52.540> room<00:00:52.570> at<00:00:53.020> home<00:00:53.530> in

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
the atmosphere of the room at home in

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.270 
the atmosphere of the room at home in
Photoshop<00:00:54.640> so<00:00:55.600> I<00:00:55.630> decided<00:00:56.170> to<00:00:56.380> shoot<00:00:56.860> with<00:00:57.130> an

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
Photoshop so I decided to shoot with an

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.330 
Photoshop so I decided to shoot with an
HDR<00:00:57.760> approach<00:00:58.480> even<00:00:58.899> that<00:00:59.350> the<00:00:59.500> picture<00:00:59.920> did

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
HDR approach even that the picture did

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.590 
HDR approach even that the picture did
not<00:01:00.610> necessarily<00:01:01.110> require<00:01:02.110> HDR<00:01:02.980> I<00:01:03.509> wanted<00:01:04.509> to

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
not necessarily require HDR I wanted to

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.870 
not necessarily require HDR I wanted to
have<00:01:04.870> several<00:01:05.590> different<00:01:05.920> exposures<00:01:06.520> of<00:01:06.550> the

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
have several different exposures of the

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.080 
have several different exposures of the
room<00:01:07.090> in<00:01:07.360> order<00:01:07.870> to<00:01:08.380> get<00:01:08.650> my<00:01:08.979> desired<00:01:09.370> results

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
room in order to get my desired results

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.990 
room in order to get my desired results
so<00:01:10.720> let's<00:01:11.050> have<00:01:11.229> a<00:01:11.290> look<00:01:11.380> and<00:01:11.740> let's<00:01:12.220> see<00:01:12.490> how<00:01:12.970> i

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
so let's have a look and let's see how i

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.260 
so let's have a look and let's see how i
created<00:01:13.570> the<00:01:13.780> pictures<00:01:14.140> I<00:01:14.400> saved<00:01:15.400> my<00:01:15.760> images

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
created the pictures I saved my images

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.850 
created the pictures I saved my images
from<00:01:16.540> my<00:01:16.690> canon<00:01:17.400> eos-1d<00:01:18.400> mark<00:01:19.060> 3<00:01:19.540> and<00:01:19.930> i'm

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
from my canon eos-1d mark 3 and i'm

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.910 
from my canon eos-1d mark 3 and i'm
opening<00:01:21.430> them<00:01:21.640> up<00:01:21.670> in<00:01:22.500> dxo<00:01:23.610> opticspro<00:01:24.610> 5<00:01:25.210> i'm

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
opening them up in dxo opticspro 5 i'm

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.710 
opening them up in dxo opticspro 5 i'm
using<00:01:26.920> this<00:01:27.070> basically<00:01:27.520> as<00:01:27.729> my<00:01:27.940> raw<00:01:28.150> converter

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
using this basically as my raw converter

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.170 
using this basically as my raw converter
i<00:01:29.670> use<00:01:30.670> a<00:01:30.700> DXL<00:01:31.510> preset<00:01:32.049> vivid<00:01:33.010> and<00:01:33.250> sharp<00:01:33.700> now

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
i use a DXL preset vivid and sharp now

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:41.370 
i use a DXL preset vivid and sharp now
say<00:01:34.450> apply<00:01:35.080> now<00:01:36.600> go<00:01:37.600> process<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:41.110> added

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
say apply now go process and I added

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.010 
say apply now go process and I added
where<00:01:41.740> 12<00:01:42.070> pictures<00:01:42.400> I<00:01:42.790> export<00:01:43.630> them<00:01:43.810> as<00:01:43.840> a

digital negative file a DNG because i

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.010 
digital negative file a DNG because i
want<00:01:48.939> to<00:01:49.060> have<00:01:49.240> still<00:01:49.869> a<00:01:50.080> raw<00:01:50.350> picture<00:01:50.860> for<00:01:51.310> my

the reason I'm using the XO pro as my
