00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
here so today I've got a little tutorial

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.580 
here so today I've got a little tutorial
for<00:00:18.060> you<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.420> it's<00:00:18.840> gonna<00:00:18.930> be<00:00:19.020> demonstrating

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
for you and it's gonna be demonstrating

for you and it's gonna be demonstrating
this<00:00:19.680> little<00:00:19.949> trick<00:00:20.130> you<00:00:20.250> can<00:00:20.279> do<00:00:20.550> while

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
this little trick you can do while

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.230 
this little trick you can do while
you're<00:00:21.689> free-falling<00:00:22.130> so<00:00:23.130> as<00:00:23.490> I'm<00:00:23.850> sure<00:00:23.880> most

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
you're free-falling so as I'm sure most

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.089 
you're free-falling so as I'm sure most
of<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:24.480> probably<00:00:24.600> found<00:00:25.050> out<00:00:25.289> already<00:00:25.410> when

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
of you probably found out already when

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.980 
of you probably found out already when
you<00:00:26.279> jump<00:00:26.550> out<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.789> helicopter<00:00:26.820> or<00:00:27.570> for<00:00:27.900> my

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
you jump out of a helicopter or for my

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.720 
you jump out of a helicopter or for my
great<00:00:28.199> height<00:00:28.439> such<00:00:28.710> as<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.859> building<00:00:29.340> or<00:00:29.519> a

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
great height such as a building or a

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.990 
great height such as a building or a
mountain<00:00:30.090> you<00:00:30.619> begin<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.650> freefall<00:00:32.250> now<00:00:32.850> when

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
mountain you begin to freefall now when

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.400 
mountain you begin to freefall now when
you're<00:00:33.120> free-falling<00:00:33.329> normally<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.320> will

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
you're free-falling normally you will

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.620 
you're free-falling normally you will
just<00:00:34.590> go<00:00:34.770> pretty<00:00:35.579> much<00:00:35.790> directly<00:00:36.000> straight

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
just go pretty much directly straight

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.750 
just go pretty much directly straight
down<00:00:36.840> towards<00:00:37.559> its<00:00:37.860> towards<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.250> ground<00:00:38.399> and

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
down towards its towards the ground and

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.729 
down towards its towards the ground and
you<00:00:38.879> can<00:00:39.210> travel<00:00:39.480> forward<00:00:39.780> this<00:00:39.989> tiny<00:00:40.379> amount

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
you can travel forward this tiny amount

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.430 
you can travel forward this tiny amount
but<00:00:41.340> it's<00:00:41.460> really<00:00:41.640> not<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.940> lot<00:00:42.200> so<00:00:43.200> what<00:00:43.320> my

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
but it's really not a lot so what my

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.330 
but it's really not a lot so what my
friends<00:00:43.710> going<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:43.860> do<00:00:43.980> now<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.160> gonna

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
friends going to do now is gonna

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.590 
friends going to do now is gonna
demonstrate<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.940> trick<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.390> you're<00:00:45.510> going

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
demonstrate the trick and you're going

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.840 
demonstrate the trick and you're going
to<00:00:45.660> see<00:00:45.870> what<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:46.050> mean<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:47.010> when<00:00:47.309> he<00:00:47.460> jumps<00:00:47.730> up

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
to see what I mean so when he jumps up

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.270 
to see what I mean so when he jumps up
here<00:00:48.059> he's<00:00:48.270> gonna<00:00:48.420> go<00:00:48.690> forwards<00:00:49.320> rather<00:00:50.070> than

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
here he's gonna go forwards rather than

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.130 
here he's gonna go forwards rather than
straight<00:00:50.610> down<00:00:50.850> into<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.449> mountain<00:00:51.840> like<00:00:52.020> you

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
straight down into the mountain like you

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.680 
straight down into the mountain like you
would<00:00:52.260> normally<00:00:52.379> do<00:00:53.120> so<00:00:54.120> as<00:00:54.180> you'll<00:00:54.329> see<00:00:54.510> here

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
would normally do so as you'll see here

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.750 
would normally do so as you'll see here
he<00:00:55.379> begins<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.739> fall<00:00:55.980> he<00:00:56.190> then<00:00:56.340> starts<00:00:56.730> the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
he begins the fall he then starts the

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.490 
he begins the fall he then starts the
trick<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.629> can<00:00:57.780> see<00:00:57.930> him<00:00:58.020> gliding

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
trick and you can see him gliding

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.049 
trick and you can see him gliding
straight<00:00:58.859> forwards<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.430> he's<00:00:59.609> traveling<00:00:59.969> a

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
straight forwards and he's traveling a

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.969 
straight forwards and he's traveling a
great<00:01:00.270> distance<00:01:01.280> towards<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.430> Earth<00:01:02.609> ocean

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
great distance towards the Earth ocean

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.830 
great distance towards the Earth ocean
so<00:01:04.979> i'm<00:01:05.339> going<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.549> show<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.729> right<00:01:05.909> now<00:01:05.970> so

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
so i'm going to show you right now so

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.149 
so i'm going to show you right now so
you<00:01:07.020> want<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.200> do<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.409> just<00:01:07.560> begin

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
you want to do is just begin

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.609 
you want to do is just begin
free-falling<00:01:08.670> then<00:01:09.479> as<00:01:09.750> your<00:01:10.020> free<00:01:10.200> fall<00:01:10.439> and

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
free-falling then as your free fall and

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.370 
free-falling then as your free fall and
you<00:01:10.740> want<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.280> simply<00:01:11.939> push<00:01:12.240> forwards<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.960> tiny

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
you want to simply push forwards a tiny

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.230 
you want to simply push forwards a tiny
little<00:01:13.619> bit<00:01:13.890> on<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.070> left<00:01:14.250> analog<00:01:14.430> stick<00:01:14.549> so

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
little bit on the left analog stick so

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.969 
little bit on the left analog stick so
instead<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.509> like<00:01:15.810> pushing<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.590> left-hander

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
instead of like pushing the left-hander

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.740 
instead of like pushing the left-hander
stick<00:01:17.189> all<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.549> way<00:01:17.640> up<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:18.390> want<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.600> push<00:01:18.720> it

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
stick all the way up you want to push it

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.710 
stick all the way up you want to push it
just<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:19.200> tiny<00:01:19.380> bit<00:01:19.560> like<00:01:19.890> not<00:01:20.340> halfway<00:01:20.640> up<00:01:21.030> just

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
just a tiny bit like not halfway up just

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.140 
just a tiny bit like not halfway up just
a<00:01:21.840> bit<00:01:21.960> less<00:01:22.200> than<00:01:22.229> half<00:01:22.680> way<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.159> we<00:01:23.850> may<00:01:23.970> take

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
a bit less than half way and we may take

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.359 
a bit less than half way and we may take
a<00:01:24.180> couple<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.570> different<00:01:24.960> tries<00:01:25.220> but<00:01:26.220> it's

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
a couple of different tries but it's

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.219 
a couple of different tries but it's
pretty<00:01:26.700> simple<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.150> do<00:01:27.270> you'll<00:01:27.450> get<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:28.049> may

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
pretty simple to do you'll get it it may

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.260 
pretty simple to do you'll get it it may
be<00:01:28.290> in<00:01:28.439> two<00:01:28.619> tries<00:01:28.920> but<00:01:29.850> yeah<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.000> want<00:01:30.240> to

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
be in two tries but yeah you want to

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.370 
be in two tries but yeah you want to
push<00:01:30.420> your<00:01:30.570> left<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.869> long<00:01:30.990> stick<00:01:31.200> the

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
push your left and long stick the

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.280 
push your left and long stick the
tiniest<00:01:31.829> bit<00:01:32.009> up<00:01:32.750> one<00:01:33.750> going<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:33.960> do<00:01:34.020> now<00:01:34.170> I'm

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
tiniest bit up one going to do now I'm

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.140 
tiniest bit up one going to do now I'm
just<00:01:34.409> gonna<00:01:34.560> demonstrate<00:01:34.829> on<00:01:35.400> how<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:35.909> would

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
just gonna demonstrate on how you would

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.850 
just gonna demonstrate on how you would
normally<00:01:36.360> fall<00:01:36.810> if<00:01:36.990> you're<00:01:37.380> jumping<00:01:37.740> from

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
normally fall if you're jumping from

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.770 
normally fall if you're jumping from
that<00:01:38.040> exact<00:01:38.340> same<00:01:38.520> spot<00:01:38.700> without<00:01:39.299> doing<00:01:39.720> this

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
that exact same spot without doing this

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.210 
that exact same spot without doing this
trick<00:01:39.990> you'll<00:01:40.229> see<00:01:40.500> how<00:01:40.860> much<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.040> a

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
trick you'll see how much of a

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.100 
trick you'll see how much of a
difference<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:41.759> made<00:01:42.060> as<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.840> can<00:01:42.990> see

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
difference this is made as you can see

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.780 
difference this is made as you can see
I've<00:01:43.320> landed<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.770> great<00:01:44.100> distance<00:01:44.310> from<00:01:44.700> the

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
I've landed a great distance from the

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.639 
I've landed a great distance from the
