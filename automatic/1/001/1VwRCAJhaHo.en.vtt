so<00:00:05.549> looking<00:00:05.819> at<00:00:05.910> the<00:00:06.060> bottom<00:00:06.420> you<00:00:07.019> can<00:00:07.109> get<00:00:07.200> a

00:00:07.219 --> 00:00:07.229 
so looking at the bottom you can get a

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:09.890 
so looking at the bottom you can get a
better<00:00:07.410> idea<00:00:07.529> of<00:00:07.859> how<00:00:08.099> this<00:00:08.370> rides<00:00:09.300> in<00:00:09.720> the

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
better idea of how this rides in the

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.759 
better idea of how this rides in the
table<00:00:10.440> saw<00:00:10.650> miter<00:00:11.219> gauges<00:00:12.559> first<00:00:13.559> let<00:00:13.679> me

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
table saw miter gauges first let me

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.100 
table saw miter gauges first let me
point<00:00:13.919> out<00:00:14.039> here<00:00:14.429> are<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.969> nuts<00:00:15.690> that<00:00:15.900> I<00:00:15.990> was

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.110 
point out here are the nuts that I was

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:17.779 
point out here are the nuts that I was
talking<00:00:16.320> about<00:00:16.350> these<00:00:16.590> are<00:00:16.650> just<00:00:16.920> again<00:00:17.580> there

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
talking about these are just again there

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.910 
talking about these are just again there
they<00:00:18.270> have<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.510> flange<00:00:18.869> with<00:00:19.289> some<00:00:19.410> spikes<00:00:19.710> on

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
they have a flange with some spikes on

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.830 
they have a flange with some spikes on
it<00:00:20.070> they<00:00:20.550> just<00:00:20.760> bite<00:00:21.000> into<00:00:21.269> the<00:00:21.390> wood<00:00:21.539> so<00:00:21.779> you

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
it they just bite into the wood so you

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.300 
it they just bite into the wood so you
can<00:00:22.080> confess<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.560> start<00:00:22.740> with<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.920> top<00:00:23.099> down

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
can confess and start with the top down

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.329 
can confess and start with the top down
again<00:00:24.090> very<00:00:24.630> inexpensive<00:00:25.470> pick<00:00:26.099> them<00:00:26.220> up

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:26.339 
again very inexpensive pick them up

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:29.390 
again very inexpensive pick them up
anywhere<00:00:26.759> and<00:00:27.710> you<00:00:28.710> can<00:00:28.859> see<00:00:29.009> where<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:29.189> have

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
anywhere and you can see where I have

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.810 
anywhere and you can see where I have
multiple<00:00:30.500> contact<00:00:31.500> points<00:00:31.589> to<00:00:32.520> move<00:00:32.700> the

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
multiple contact points to move the

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.670 
multiple contact points to move the
sledge<00:00:33.090> around<00:00:33.480> or<00:00:33.810> excuse<00:00:34.230> me<00:00:34.290> move<00:00:34.500> the

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
sledge around or excuse me move the

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.970 
sledge around or excuse me move the
fence<00:00:34.890> around<00:00:35.329> so<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:36.390> get<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.629> huge<00:00:37.350> variety<00:00:37.620> of

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
fence around so I get a huge variety of

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.889 
fence around so I get a huge variety of
angles<00:00:38.910> an<00:00:39.840> infinite<00:00:40.320> amount<00:00:40.410> really<00:00:40.980> now<00:00:41.899> the

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
angles an infinite amount really now the

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.410 
angles an infinite amount really now the
most<00:00:43.050> important<00:00:43.469> part<00:00:44.000> obviously<00:00:45.000> on<00:00:45.360> the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
most important part obviously on the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.060 
most important part obviously on the
underside<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:45.899> probably<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.410> entire<00:00:46.530> sled

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
underside and probably the entire sled

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.860 
underside and probably the entire sled
are<00:00:47.640> these<00:00:47.789> runners<00:00:48.030> right<00:00:48.329> here<00:00:49.399> there<00:00:50.399> are

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
are these runners right here there are

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.049 
are these runners right here there are
dozens<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:52.170> different<00:00:52.500> possibilities<00:00:53.059> to

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
dozens of different possibilities to

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.130 
dozens of different possibilities to
make<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.719> runners<00:00:55.109> out<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:56.399> could<00:00:56.640> use

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
make the runners out of you could use

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.750 
make the runners out of you could use
you<00:00:58.140> know<00:00:58.260> just<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.710> nice<00:00:59.010> piece<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.309> hardwood

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
you know just a nice piece of hardwood

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.819 
you know just a nice piece of hardwood
say<00:01:00.030> oak<00:01:00.300> or<00:01:00.539> even<00:01:00.719> an<00:01:00.809> exotic<00:01:01.170> would<00:01:01.559> say

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
say oak or even an exotic would say

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.740 
say oak or even an exotic would say
cocobolo<00:01:02.519> or<00:01:02.969> Purpleheart<00:01:03.269> where<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.600> has

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
cocobolo or Purpleheart where it has

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.150 
cocobolo or Purpleheart where it has
some<00:01:04.110> oils<00:01:04.470> in<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.769> which<00:01:04.920> will<00:01:05.129> help

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
some oils in it which will help

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.870 
some oils in it which will help
lubricate<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.650> and<00:01:07.650> also<00:01:08.310> keep<00:01:08.520> straight

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
lubricate it and and also keep straight

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.510 
lubricate it and and also keep straight
but<00:01:09.390> again<00:01:09.659> it's<00:01:09.900> wood<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.439> will<00:01:10.770> move<00:01:11.189> on<00:01:11.400> you

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
but again it's wood it will move on you

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.219 
but again it's wood it will move on you
no<00:01:11.640> matter<00:01:11.670> what<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.150> do<00:01:12.299> between<00:01:12.780> winter

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
you so you could buy just a miter gauge

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.819 
you so you could buy just a miter gauge
bar<00:01:23.729> from<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:25.140> know<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.259> lot<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.650> more

know by all means go for it I tried to

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.810 
know by all means go for it I tried to
build<00:01:46.660> this<00:01:46.870> on<00:01:47.050> the<00:01:47.170> cheap<00:01:47.410> and<00:01:47.650> using<00:01:48.460> parts

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
build this on the cheap and using parts

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.730 
build this on the cheap and using parts
that<00:01:48.940> I<00:01:49.000> just<00:01:49.180> had<00:01:49.330> laying<00:01:49.570> around<00:01:49.750> so<00:01:50.560> what<00:01:50.680> I

that I just had laying around so what I
used<00:01:51.070> here<00:01:51.190> is<00:01:51.610> actually<00:01:52.390> part<00:01:52.990> of<00:01:53.110> a<00:01:53.200> cutting

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
used here is actually part of a cutting

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.580 
used here is actually part of a cutting
board<00:01:53.770> and<00:01:54.070> this<00:01:55.030> is<00:01:55.300> just<00:01:55.720> a<00:01:55.840> nylon<00:01:56.050> cutting

board and this is just a nylon cutting

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.800 
board and this is just a nylon cutting
board<00:01:56.860> now<00:01:57.340> I<00:01:57.370> did<00:01:57.610> buy<00:01:57.790> the<00:01:58.270> cutting<00:01:58.540> board<00:01:58.750> a

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
board now I did buy the cutting board a

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.300 
board now I did buy the cutting board a
new<00:01:58.990> but<00:01:59.230> I<00:01:59.260> bought<00:01:59.410> in<00:01:59.590> it<00:01:59.680> like<00:01:59.800> a<00:01:59.860> discount
