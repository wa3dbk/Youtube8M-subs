is<00:01:39.249> it<00:01:39.579> even<00:01:39.850> real<00:01:40.479> engineering<00:01:41.109> what<00:01:41.859> I

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
is it even real engineering what I

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.099 
is it even real engineering what I
didn't<00:01:42.460> get<00:01:42.579> the<00:01:42.729> interview<00:01:42.969> oh<00:01:43.359> I<00:01:43.810> totally
