00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.980
 another year another title dedicated to 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.900
 ruto and the kishimoto ninjas of other gods 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.820
 seller connect with the brand han done 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.620
 soldoni and quality more than worthy of 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.750
 they hit hard is the main reason 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.760
 of their current success we are now 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.530
 but dangerously close to that 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.170
 line where the repetition excess 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.580
 it gets annoying the cyberconnect have 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.010
 from time to time has brought changes 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.050
 to the gameplay of the last ninja storm 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.239
 yet the fundamental formula has remained 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.190
 always too similar with changes 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.540
 content that in recent years has not 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.519
 the fans seem satisfied 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.199
 so it is normal to look with an eye 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.420
 the new one is particularly critical 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.070
 chapter of the series that comes out one step away 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.869
 from the end of the manga and seeks to 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.519
 take a rude step forward by entering 

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:06.860
 in the new interesting system 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.810
 mechanical we were able to try 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.909
 on duty naruto shippuden ultimate ninja 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.680
 storm and revolution thanks now demo 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.420
 available from a few days is today 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.580
 we will try to describe in detail 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.290
 just the new system 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.360
 let's share the gameplay from 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.100
 revolution will be immediately familiar to whom 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.960
 has already tried the previous chapters 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.120
 everything revolves around a series of attacks 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.500
 quick to interrupt 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.110
 a combo with the technique of 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.820
 replacement and the ciak to indispensable 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.220
 energy that allows the ninja to perform 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.500
 Special technical maneuvers available 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.630
 they are not few, they range from quick shots 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.980
 side assad heads down with which one 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.470
 can stretch the combos out of proportion 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.930
 up to links of special techniques 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.850
 and certainly devastating normal attacks 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.159
 a skeleton light if compared to 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.659
 competitive fighting but the naruto are 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.159
 always been the most focused titles 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.659
 on the spectacular and the fun 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.330
 with friends than on balance 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.740
 his matsuyama perfect however 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.900
 this time they wanted to open up a 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.540
 little to competitive by entering a pair 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.580
 of mechanical mechanics the first mechanical 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.020
 it is counterattack on guard that stuns 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.569
 the opponent for a long time if 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.860
 intercepts a move at the right time 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:11.510
 even preventing him from using the 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.430
 replacement to get out of trouble 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.379
 we can immediately state that the technique 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.180
 will become a fundamental in the games 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:18.709
 online because considering the window 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.239
 rather large temporal in group 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.430
 working is too easy 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.319
 use it against aggressive opponents 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.909
 may even be a convenience 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.830
 counter with long combos with 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:29.180
 enhanced shots that succeed the most 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.620
 sometimes to counteract too 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.850
 the very effective log of the 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.950
 replacement 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.200
 the second inefficient but nevertheless 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.150
 useful is a broken attack guard the 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.160
 their quantity is counted two per 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.230
 matches must therefore be exploited in the same way 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.060
 against particularly opponents 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.650
 we liked the innovations though 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.700
 noting the excessive usefulness of the 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.200
 countermoves 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.640
 but even more we appreciated the 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.860
 clear division between the styles of play 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.510
 of the fighters who now besides the 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.130
 awakening mode and supreme technique 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.470
 presents a concentrated action movie 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.480
 on the boards of the companions all are more 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.250
 elaborate now with the awakening that 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.410
 change the mood set if used partially 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.150
 and allows the usual to turn into 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.920
 a powerful enhanced version of the 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.020
 own fighter when the coffin 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.370
 dedicated enough charge the 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.650
 supreme technical mode 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.210
 for its part it is the most classic and the 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.890
 its strength lies in the ability to 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.080
 use right supreme power 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.910
 devastating even in combination with i 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.770
 own companions assist the mode 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.900
 action is the most particular of the 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.520
 small group because besides allowing to 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.290
 change your assets from offensive e 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.660
 defensive at will with a bit of chakra 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.580
 offers a combined assault that seals the 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.040
 powers of the opponent by blocking 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.910
 temporarily supreme assist techniques 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.830
 and more 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.150
 since the styles can be selected from 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.410
 any fighter 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.080
 the variety reached is to say the least 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.030
 the balancing is just delicious 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.340
 among the types there is no step exactly of 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.010
 the wine sector is always excellent 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.990
 finally with exaggerated and exciting strokes 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.790
 commendable animations excellent models 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.340
 three-dimensional fighters 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.690
 it should however be emphasized as cyberconnect 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.850
 just can't seem to work 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.890
 properly on engine optimization 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.720
 because during certain moves they are noticed 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.060
 declines of unacceptable fragments for a 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.130
 the title of this genus is also poor 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.460
 netcode unfortunately already testable in the 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.460
 demo
