the<00:00:19.470> thing<00:00:19.650> that<00:00:19.770> was<00:00:19.859> really<00:00:20.039> interesting

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
the thing that was really interesting

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.310 
the thing that was really interesting
for<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.880> team<00:00:21.090> was<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.600> go<00:00:21.689> into<00:00:21.869> essentially

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
for the team was to go into essentially

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.560 
for the team was to go into essentially
uncharted<00:00:22.980> territory<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:24.000> take<00:00:24.180> middle-earth

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
uncharted territory to take middle-earth

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.849 
uncharted territory to take middle-earth
and<00:00:24.840> look<00:00:25.019> at<00:00:25.109> what's<00:00:25.260> been<00:00:25.350> created<00:00:25.740> before

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
and look at what's been created before

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.269 
and look at what's been created before
and<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.550> expand<00:00:26.910> upon<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.890> we<00:00:28.890> start<00:00:29.160> with

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
and to expand upon that we start with

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.620 
and to expand upon that we start with
basic<00:00:29.609> storyboards<00:00:30.119> for<00:00:30.210> each<00:00:30.330> environment

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
basic storyboards for each environment

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.540 
basic storyboards for each environment
trying<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.380> figure<00:00:31.529> out<00:00:31.710> how<00:00:31.920> we<00:00:31.980> can<00:00:32.160> pull<00:00:32.399> out

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
trying to figure out how we can pull out

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.190 
trying to figure out how we can pull out
what<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:32.820> essentially<00:00:33.329> called<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.750> character

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
what I essentially called the character

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.490 
what I essentially called the character
of<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.410> environment<00:00:39.320> something<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.410> is

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
of the environment something that is

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.930 
of the environment something that is
really<00:00:40.649> important<00:00:41.100> for<00:00:41.129> us<00:00:41.250> is<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.520> create<00:00:41.910> a

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
really important for us is to create a

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.330 
really important for us is to create a
sense<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.450> epic<00:00:42.780> cinematic<00:00:42.930> scale<00:00:43.469> in<00:00:43.680> some<00:00:44.250> of

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
sense of epic cinematic scale in some of

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.160 
sense of epic cinematic scale in some of
the<00:00:44.430> environments<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.120> then<00:00:45.899> as<00:00:46.140> you

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
the environments and then as you

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.750 
the environments and then as you
progress<00:00:46.410> through<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.890> game<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.399> make<00:00:47.550> sure

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
progress through the game to make sure

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.069 
progress through the game to make sure
that<00:00:47.940> we've<00:00:48.030> strategically<00:00:48.210> place<00:00:48.840> in

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
that we've strategically place in

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.110 
that we've strategically place in
contrast<00:00:49.710> areas<00:00:50.280> where<00:00:50.789> there's<00:00:50.969> more

contrast areas where there's more

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.119 
contrast areas where there's more
claustrophobia<00:00:51.780> just<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.500> create<00:00:52.680> visual

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
claustrophobia just to create visual

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.020 
claustrophobia just to create visual
variety<00:00:54.739> we<00:00:55.739> also<00:00:55.920> use<00:00:56.160> color<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.640> atmosphere

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
variety we also use color and atmosphere

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.760 
variety we also use color and atmosphere
to<00:00:57.210> ensure<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.750> each<00:00:57.930> environment<00:00:58.230> has<00:00:58.559> its

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
to ensure that each environment has its

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.789 
to ensure that each environment has its
own<00:00:58.949> personality<00:00:59.190> its<00:00:59.850> own<00:01:00.059> character

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.230 

barrow<00:01:04.799> Downs<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.190> a<00:01:05.220> really<00:01:05.700> good<00:01:05.790> example<00:01:05.850> of

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
barrow Downs is a really good example of

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.880 
barrow Downs is a really good example of
us<00:01:06.360> using<00:01:06.659> atmosphere<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.260> accentuating<00:01:07.860> the

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
us using atmosphere and accentuating the

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.969 
us using atmosphere and accentuating the
idea<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.430> character<00:01:08.850> within<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.360> environment

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
idea of character within the environment

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:11.990

throughout<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.159> environment<00:01:11.610> there<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:11.970> a

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
throughout that environment there is a

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.300 
throughout that environment there is a
living<00:01:12.240> fog<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:13.259> fog<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.770> moves<00:01:14.009> in<00:01:14.190> and
