00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.070
 hello my name is vanessa castañeda and 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.170
 I will be your guide in this video you have 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.360
 asked who plans everything that happens 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:19.300
 in your city ​​in terms of construction 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.400
 housing and others have you thought which 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.470
 it should be the best planning for 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.630
 your city grows in an organized way and 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.880
 aesthetically pleasing this time 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.130
 I will talk about the specialty of the 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.050
 architecture that focuses on the city 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.570
 as such and determines the strokes 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.790
 extensions reconstructions and reforms 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.110
 of the city and populations in general 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.110
 we will talk about urbanism 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.140
 the cities are planned thanks to 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.550
 urbanism is even has the 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.370
 responsibility that the buildings 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.740
 old ones are harmoniously incorporated 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.900
 in modern cities well the 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.090
 urbanism is the technique and science of 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.760
 the planning and planning of 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.110
 cities and the territory is also 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.390
 commission studies on the 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.160
 urban phenomena the impact of 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.310
 urbanization in the environment and 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.890
 territory the urbanist architect is a 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.770
 Professional with ethical technical training 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.680
 and humanistic sense that designs and 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.990
 plan supervises and directs the 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.090
 execution of architectural projects and 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.850
 urban areas to implement 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.950
 habitat structuring transforming 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.650
 and adapting physical spaces to 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.440
 various human activities integrating 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.860
 thus aesthetic techniques variables 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.110
 economic and environmental planning 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.210
 finds closely related to 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.970
 civil engineering areas such as the 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.570
 political science ecology the 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.080
 geography the economy the law the 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.680
 sociology and the 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:53.140
 among others the practices and techniques of 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.210
 urban planning intervene in the 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.270
 application of the urban policies of 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.980
 housing equipment 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.930
 infrastructure and transportation 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.270
 environment and resource management 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.790
 the first urban plan that took 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.490
 out was the port of athens in the 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.200
 ancient greece on the plane of a 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.920
 grid that is now known as 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.750
 hypodermic model that has been copied to 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.990
 throughout history even 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.350
 currently the Piraeus as it is called 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:26.290
 this port dates from the year 450 before 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.940
 Christ - the body has as its object 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.910
 main the study of cities 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.870
 from an integral perspective 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.830
 facing the responsibility of 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.180
 study and order urban systems 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.430
 based on the dynamic components 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.590
 that make up the city needs 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.990
 social habits and the 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.030
 environment the organism is the 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.370
 responsible for designing the public space 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.940
 and the elements that make it up 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.750
 like streets 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.940
 and parks platforms among others as well as 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.890
 urban management that defines how 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.240
 discuss what was planned another factor 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.000
 important within the architecture 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.950
 urbanist is the legal dimension of 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.320
 this since its scope of action 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.840
 includes objects with different status 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.660
 legal as public property and 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.600
 private in this way the plans 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.610
 urban developments that normally give 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.620
 subject to a legislative framework 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.170
 specific about land ownership 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.570
 and the rights of use associated with the 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.340
 different property regimes for 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.830
 give you a practical example of urbanism 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.080
 are you going to think of any city you've 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.570
 seen as the avenues flow 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.210
 in others all interconnected by 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.220
 streets and races you've also seen how 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:40.670
 the neighborhoods are grids that fit 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.950
 perfectly you have also seen how the 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.410
 parks and common areas are located in 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.990
 sites for easy access for all 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.870
 well this is urban planning the 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:53.210
 urbanist architect can perform 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.340
 in public and private companies like 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.600
 designer of architectural projects or 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.140
 urban 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:02.900
 buildings green areas of equipment and 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.270
 restoration in the development of workshops and 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.060
 architecture and construction companies 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:10.550
 also in urban design consultancies 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.250
 and urban planning architecture 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.010
 urbanism promotes the creation and 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.959
 maintenance of a diverse environment 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.720
 neat and attractive with a context 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.830
 appropriate to develop 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.380
 pretending to structure different 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:25.550
 communities in an integral way 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.620
 facilitating the development of all 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.770
 activities of a city as a conclusion 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.510
 we can say that one the architecture 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.000
 urbanist is the set of 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.910
 knowledge and practices applied to 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.940
 planning development and remodeling 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:44.030
 of urban nuclei 2 this discipline 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.420
 defines the construction and conservation of 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.710
 the cities and studies the relationships 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:51.680
 socio-economic aspects of it 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:54.020
 three the welfare of citizens 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.490
 is the ultimate object of the 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.410
 town planning 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.780
 well I hope that this information has 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.370
 been a great help has been a pleasure 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:05.350
 you can contact me in the links to 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.350
 then have a nice day
