 Hello to all my friends, I studied your

 comments and understood what is needed today with 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.530
 discuss your topic of nutrition after 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.809
 workout this release will be for me 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.480
 special because i will cook 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.699
 protein shake that reminds me 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.520
 childhood reminds me of my beginnings 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:51.410
 workouts well and also talk about 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.740
 basic nutritional principles after 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.710
 workout 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.910
 I will need 5 for cooking 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.870
 quail eggs 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.310
 50 grams homemade curd 3 strawberries 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.940
 whole banana 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.680
 some honey of course 400 milliliters 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.850
 of milk 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.850
 now we will all this blender 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:12.000
 well men and girls here is a charge 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.770
 energy and natural growth promoter 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.170
 muscles will definitely take it on 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.940
 training to replenish their stock 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.430
 forces 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.630
 back to what is best to eat 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.460
 after training 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.010
 the fact is that when you work out 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.170
 spent muscle glycogen stores 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.810
 energy you definitely need them 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.450
 to fill up there is such a thing as 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.760
 protein carbohydrate window it opens 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.880
 immediately after training and lasts 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.090
 about 40 minutes this means that in this 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.320
 period of time your body is the most 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:48.270
 susceptible to carbohydrates well further proteins 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.330
 main principle of nutrition after exercise 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.510
 food should be easily digestible exactly 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.950
 so we took milk 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.770
 quail eggs which are very helpful 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.130
 we elected straight with the husk because 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.550
 this is calcium we took home with you 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.910
 cottage cheese 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:08.640
 also banana strawberry honey this is fast 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.460
 carbohydrates that will give us instant 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.480
 boost energy and provoke muscles on 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.300
 further growth 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.040
 it does not mean that you need to drink only 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.440
 such a cocktail after training you 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.940
 can try to make a casserole 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.010
 which we were preparing 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.100
 several issues earlier you can 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.110
 fantasize and after an hour and a half after 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.330
 workout when you get to 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.560
 home you need to fully eat 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:36.660
 recharge with complex carbohydrates and proteins 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.870

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.660
