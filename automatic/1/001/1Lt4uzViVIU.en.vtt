00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
should boot up actually this will be one

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.600 
should boot up actually this will be one
of<00:03:07.959> the<00:03:08.020> first<00:03:08.320> armored<00:03:08.770> where<00:03:09.010> what<00:03:09.250> is<00:03:09.280> that

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
of the first armored where what is that

as you can see that was pretty quick in

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.130 
as you can see that was pretty quick in
my<00:04:19.100> opinion<00:04:19.579> took<00:04:20.150> less<00:04:20.359> than<00:04:20.390> 60<00:04:21.230> seconds<00:04:23.140> and

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
my opinion took less than 60 seconds and

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.159 
my opinion took less than 60 seconds and
I<00:04:24.410> think<00:04:24.650> so<00:04:24.860> yeah<00:04:25.760> that<00:04:25.970> says<00:04:26.180> yeah<00:04:26.600> we<00:04:26.810> are

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
I mean I'll come back to this one a bit

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:47.500 
I mean I'll come back to this one a bit
later<00:04:46.160> let's<00:04:46.430> look<00:04:46.610> at<00:04:46.729> the<00:04:46.850> watch<00:04:47.120> itself

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
later let's look at the watch itself

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.659 
later let's look at the watch itself
I'll<00:04:48.140> make<00:04:48.440> a<00:04:48.530> dedicated<00:04:48.890> video<00:04:49.100> regarding

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
I'll make a dedicated video regarding

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:51.400 
I'll make a dedicated video regarding
the<00:04:49.760> software<00:04:49.970> features<00:04:50.479> etc<00:04:50.600> and<00:04:51.020> later<00:04:51.169> on

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
the software features etc and later on

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.740 
the software features etc and later on
so<00:04:51.680> let's<00:04:51.860> look<00:04:51.979> at<00:04:52.160> the<00:04:52.250> watch<00:04:52.460> and<00:04:52.790> it's<00:04:53.600> a

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
so let's look at the watch and it's a

00:04:53.750 --> 00:05:01.689 
so let's look at the watch and it's a
swipe<00:04:54.200> up<00:04:54.440> to<00:04:54.710> get<00:04:54.950> started

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:01.699 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:03.969 

so<00:05:02.449> these<00:05:02.569> are<00:05:02.780> the<00:05:02.870> cards<00:05:03.259> this<00:05:03.409> is<00:05:03.469> how<00:05:03.680> it

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
so these are the cards this is how it

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:07.420 
so these are the cards this is how it
displays<00:05:04.639> the<00:05:04.789> information<00:05:05.860> and<00:05:06.860> you<00:05:07.280> can

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
displays the information and you can

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.040 
displays the information and you can
remove<00:05:07.699> the<00:05:07.909> card<00:05:08.150> it<00:05:08.300> says<00:05:08.509> when<00:05:08.749> you're<00:05:08.900> done

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
remove the card it says when you're done

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.989 
remove the card it says when you're done
them<00:05:09.499> to<00:05:09.680> swipe<00:05:10.129> to<00:05:10.340> remove<00:05:10.639> so<00:05:12.400> ok<00:05:13.400> it's<00:05:13.789> Y

00:05:13.989 --> 00:05:13.999 
them to swipe to remove so ok it's Y

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:18.850 
them to swipe to remove so ok it's Y
from<00:05:14.240> left<00:05:14.449> to<00:05:14.539> right<00:05:14.749> to<00:05:14.870> remove<00:05:17.590> okay<00:05:18.590> we<00:05:18.710> can

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
from left to right to remove okay we can

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.559 
from left to right to remove okay we can
just<00:05:18.889> swipe<00:05:19.189> away<00:05:19.400> and<00:05:19.990> shows<00:05:20.990> the<00:05:21.289> whether<00:05:21.560> I

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:22.569 
just swipe away and shows the whether I

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:25.059 
just swipe away and shows the whether I
swipe<00:05:23.569> from<00:05:23.719> the<00:05:23.810> left<00:05:23.900> we<00:05:24.289> do<00:05:24.469> get<00:05:24.680> details

00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:25.069 
swipe from the left we do get details

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:27.519 
swipe from the left we do get details
about<00:05:25.370> it<00:05:26.289> okay

00:05:27.519 --> 00:05:27.529 
about it okay

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:31.360 
about it okay
so<00:05:28.279> touch<00:05:28.490> response<00:05:28.999> is<00:05:29.360> pretty<00:05:29.599> good<00:05:30.020> and<00:05:30.499> it

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
so touch response is pretty good and it

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:32.890 
so touch response is pretty good and it
also<00:05:31.520> sees<00:05:31.759> that<00:05:31.939> we<00:05:32.090> can<00:05:32.240> swipe<00:05:32.569> to<00:05:32.629> dismiss

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
also sees that we can swipe to dismiss

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.719 
also sees that we can swipe to dismiss
when<00:05:33.379> in<00:05:33.529> an<00:05:33.650> app<00:05:33.830> so<00:05:35.319> touch<00:05:36.319> anywhere<00:05:36.889> if<00:05:37.580> I

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
when in an app so touch anywhere if I

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:40.779 
when in an app so touch anywhere if I
just<00:05:37.939> touch<00:05:38.270> and<00:05:39.009> we<00:05:40.009> can<00:05:40.159> change<00:05:40.370> the<00:05:40.580> clock

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:40.789 
just touch and we can change the clock

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:43.269 
just touch and we can change the clock
faces<00:05:41.090> so<00:05:42.020> that's<00:05:42.229> an<00:05:42.379> advantage<00:05:42.889> with<00:05:43.099> the

00:05:43.269 --> 00:05:43.279 
faces so that's an advantage with the

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:45.369 
faces so that's an advantage with the
Smart<00:05:43.729> Watch<00:05:43.939> for<00:05:44.539> example<00:05:44.930> let's<00:05:45.050> say<00:05:45.199> if<00:05:45.289> you

00:05:45.369 --> 00:05:45.379 
Smart Watch for example let's say if you

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:49.029 
Smart Watch for example let's say if you
like<00:05:45.529> this<00:05:45.740> one<00:05:46.000> you<00:05:47.000> can<00:05:47.029> just<00:05:47.330> tap<00:05:47.599> and<00:05:48.039> we

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:49.039 
like this one you can just tap and we

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:51.670 
like this one you can just tap and we
get<00:05:49.219> this<00:05:49.539> watch<00:05:50.539> again<00:05:50.930> we<00:05:51.110> can<00:05:51.259> hold<00:05:51.469> this

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
get this watch again we can hold this

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.149 
get this watch again we can hold this
one<00:05:51.979> also<00:05:52.310> I<00:05:52.340> believe<00:05:53.620> the<00:05:54.620> button

00:05:55.149 --> 00:05:55.159 
one also I believe the button

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:58.600 
one also I believe the button
I<00:05:56.169> mean<00:05:57.169> I'm<00:05:57.289> also<00:05:57.500> pretty<00:05:57.830> new<00:05:58.099> to<00:05:58.250> this<00:05:58.400> and

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
I mean I'm also pretty new to this and

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.959 
I mean I'm also pretty new to this and
