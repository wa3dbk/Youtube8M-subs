hi<00:00:00.599> there<00:00:00.870> this<00:00:00.900> is<00:00:01.110> Ken<00:00:01.530> I'm<00:00:01.949> here<00:00:02.399> for

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
hi there this is Ken I'm here for

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.510 
hi there this is Ken I'm here for
another<00:00:02.879> unit<00:00:03.419> conversion<00:00:04.020> problem<00:00:04.500> and<00:00:04.830> this

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
another unit conversion problem and this

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.140 
another unit conversion problem and this
time<00:00:05.850> it<00:00:06.779> involves<00:00:07.529> nine<00:00:08.130> pounds<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.000> eight

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
time it involves nine pounds and eight

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.780 
time it involves nine pounds and eight
funds<00:00:09.530> we<00:00:10.530> converted<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:12.019> kilograms<00:00:13.519> so<00:00:14.519> let

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
funds we converted to kilograms so let

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.529 
funds we converted to kilograms so let
it<00:00:14.910> first<00:00:15.059> notice<00:00:15.900> that<00:00:16.369> we're<00:00:17.369> given<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:18.060> not

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
it first notice that we're given a not

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.109 
it first notice that we're given a not
in<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.990> same<00:00:19.289> units<00:00:19.710> we're<00:00:20.369> given<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.760> unit<00:00:21.000> in

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
in the same units we're given a unit in

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.650 
in the same units we're given a unit in
pounds<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:21.900> we're<00:00:22.020> also<00:00:22.109> given<00:00:22.590> unit<00:00:23.070> Ananse

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
pounds and we're also given unit Ananse

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.109 
pounds and we're also given unit Ananse
analysis<00:00:24.689> so<00:00:25.619> first<00:00:25.920> let's<00:00:26.250> try<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.519> simplify

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
analysis so first let's try to simplify

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.589 
analysis so first let's try to simplify
this<00:00:27.359> expression<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.619> it's<00:00:29.460> very<00:00:29.760> simple<00:00:30.210> and

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
this expression and it's very simple and

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.569 
this expression and it's very simple and
basic<00:00:31.040> knowledge<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:33.380> one<00:00:34.380> pound<00:00:35.130> is

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
basic knowledge that one pound is

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:42.440 
basic knowledge that one pound is
equivalent<00:00:36.500> to<00:00:39.440> 60<00:00:40.879> non-conscious<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.090> a

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
equivalent to 60 non-conscious is a

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:50.990 
equivalent to 60 non-conscious is a
regular<00:00:43.200> pen<00:00:43.469> ordinary<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.870> so<00:00:47.420> we<00:00:48.420> can<00:00:50.000> this

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
regular pen ordinary and so we can this

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.610 
regular pen ordinary and so we can this
given<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.809> just<00:00:52.670> nine<00:00:54.050> point<00:00:56.600> five<00:00:57.600> nine<00:00:57.989> point

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
given is just nine point five nine point

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.250 
given is just nine point five nine point
fifty<00:00:59.129> pounds<00:01:00.140> so<00:01:01.140> if<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:02.070> want<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:03.260> this

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
fifty pounds so if you want to this

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.320 
fifty pounds so if you want to this
whole<00:01:04.619> expression<00:01:04.949> if<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.369> want<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.820> see<00:01:06.060> that

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
whole expression if you want to see that

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.740 
whole expression if you want to see that
we<00:01:07.340> be<00:01:08.340> honest<00:01:08.909> there<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.420> converted<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.470> is

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
we be honest there is converted to is

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.289 
we be honest there is converted to is
converted<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:13.520> pound<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.390> one<00:01:16.020> pound

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
converted to pound that is one pound

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:23.210 
converted to pound that is one pound
sixty<00:01:18.299> nuns<00:01:19.369> so<00:01:20.750> cancel<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.930> arms<00:01:22.439> yet<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:23.009> we

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
sixty nuns so cancel the arms yet and we

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.149 
sixty nuns so cancel the arms yet and we
get<00:01:23.869> zero<00:01:24.869> point<00:01:25.229> five<00:01:26.270> point<00:01:27.270> fifty<00:01:28.159> pounds

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
get zero point five point fifty pounds

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.090 
get zero point five point fifty pounds
so<00:01:30.500> we<00:01:31.500> can<00:01:31.770> use<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.520> as<00:01:32.700> an<00:01:32.850> intermediary

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
so we can use that as an intermediary

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.730 
so we can use that as an intermediary
intermediate<00:01:35.100> solution<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.540> we<00:01:36.750> can<00:01:37.020> proceed

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
intermediate solution so we can proceed

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.010 
intermediate solution so we can proceed
to<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.009> next<00:01:38.340> solution<00:01:38.700> by<00:01:39.060> knowing<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.720> one

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
to the next solution by knowing that one

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.410 
to the next solution by knowing that one
kilogram<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:41.479> equivalent<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.570> two<00:01:43.110> point<00:01:43.590> two

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
kilogram is equivalent to two point two

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.649 
kilogram is equivalent to two point two
pounds<00:01:45.420> approximately<00:01:46.460> now<00:01:47.460> we<00:01:48.149> can<00:01:48.420> proceed

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
pounds approximately now we can proceed

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.410 
pounds approximately now we can proceed
using<00:01:49.909> nine<00:01:50.909> point<00:01:51.299> five<00:01:52.009> 9.50<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.420> pounds

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
using nine point five 9.50 and pounds

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.249 
using nine point five 9.50 and pounds
and<00:01:54.770> then<00:01:55.770> we<00:01:56.159> multiply<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:58.340> that<00:01:59.340> one

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
and then we multiply that that one

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:06.469 
and then we multiply that that one
kilogram<00:02:01.259> is<00:02:01.820> just<00:02:02.820> 2.2<00:02:03.719> pounds<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:05.270> so<00:02:06.270> we

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
kilogram is just 2.2 pounds and so we

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.609 
kilogram is just 2.2 pounds and so we
can<00:02:07.759> cancel<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:09.179> unit<00:02:09.509> pounds<00:02:09.959> and<00:02:10.200> we<00:02:10.379> have

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
can cancel the unit pounds and we have

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.800 
can cancel the unit pounds and we have
our<00:02:10.830> answer<00:02:11.039> in<00:02:11.340> kilograms<00:02:11.940> and<00:02:12.209> that<00:02:12.480> would

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
our answer in kilograms and that would

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.030 
our answer in kilograms and that would
give<00:02:13.110> us

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
give us

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.970 
give us
the<00:02:14.550> answer<00:02:14.879> that<00:02:14.910> is<00:02:15.360> for<00:02:15.720> point<00:02:16.610> point<00:02:18.980> 32

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
the answer that is for point point 32

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.980 
the answer that is for point point 32
kilograms<00:02:21.110> that's<00:02:22.110> our<00:02:22.440> final<00:02:22.680> answer
