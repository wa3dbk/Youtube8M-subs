00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.330
 let's start with the classical piano 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.660
 what is virtuosity on the piano 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.910
 with his subject but I will continue as an artist it is first 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.760
 the possibility for me instrumentist to the pianist a pianist to play a 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.909
 maximum of matches in a short time 

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:18.009
 at mid-day if he gets out of records as long as I did not know at all 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:21.489
 main music music and poetry is tasting but 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:24.110
 sometimes the virtuosity coincides with 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.140
 conscious musical expression on his part tell me I think that if he knows 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.869
 that it takes because chopin who was 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.180
 she is equipped who was afraid to play in public he only made one 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.870
 dozens of concerts at most in this city a terrible track 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.739
 he writes the very young list who saw that history is very rare 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:43.650
 she the city 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.940
 nor the ordinary registers says that it was placed to the public yet it is 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.900
 chopin which largely bases all the techniques of the piano modern piano 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.730
 romantic 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.010
 parent all at 4 6 goals you can talk to us about 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.420
 he through studies since sisi studies 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.290
 but all 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.120
 the pianists suffered from the south the ministry 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.959
 certainly he has triumphed over others 

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:07.530
 not always taken 3 3 million tons in Ile-de-France still offers 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.200
 hamstrings so enjoy it's very nice that it's music 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.130
 still he feels a lot of feelings choral voice 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.350
 at a time when in the technique there are with respect to arpeggios the doubles 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.770
 blocks the estrie the very beautiful lots to full of Italian word formulas a 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.540
 little bit barbaric 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.000
 we will start with a sharing for example 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.890
 for calls it's the fact that we want 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.770
 the headquarters agreement 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.240
 let's bet we do not start again the first study to do a little bit 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.240
 common sense but several studies that are devoted to sharing 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.789
 then apart from the arpeggios 3d it is kept in the ranges there are particular 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:51.829
 the chromatic ranges selo use the black keys motoblur push the 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:53.920
 retouching 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.400
 marcel touches 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.620
 he was in a normal setting this 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.920
 informant 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.920
 christopher dodd so at the second study which is true in this case 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.800
 for me it does not bother me to play this music precisely that I played Tuesday 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.000
 evening always scared playing the 24 pc which is no longer scary you go 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 see 

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:28.039
 it's a gameplay 

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:31.969
 at the start of the season 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:34.549
 in what are called the five fingers of the five-finger exercises 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:37.839
 articulation of five fingers high speed on joint movements 

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:40.359
 So there it is not to see them lose their identity 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:43.129
 these are moments that we are like cables but we do that all 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:46.379
 simply these sums born in December have bypassed some time fork 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.379
 in time 

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:13.200
 Europe is therefore it is the left solicited this is the case of the 

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:14.099
 left and right 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.310
 we also have to breastfeed a revolutionary immediately took 0 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.779
 curious viewers do not accelerate the top speed of franÃ§ois 

00:03:20.779 --> 00:03:22.679
 rebello really at those speeds 

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:25.899
 in 2010 we had a great that a faking that interest is true that the days 

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:28.709
 complete than me but we can move on it's part of the expressions because 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.229
 that it's like a whirlwind then my revolutionary method the 

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:34.779
 revolutionary left hand is solicited and patriotic singing or 

00:03:34.779 --> 00:03:35.389
 heroic 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:38.389
 he does it by the right 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:07.349
 finally johan cavalli the coach 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.239
 we can not wait we forgot his black keys only made it takes 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.269
 stop the way path IPO evening 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.269
 but it remains a classic in the left hand has no obvious stake 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.090
 this is the place of his memoirs 

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:44.300
 North Korea laughed for six months 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.719
 the harmonies a little 

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:48.719
 sensual 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.810
 there were still more quarters particularly atypical and israel 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.560
 where the vote is not about making our outfits on every hand but two 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.870
 dates at the same hand 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.039
 parts of the sixths and secondly 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:03.039
 in a hamburger for their part the thirds 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.660
 nicknamed the Siberian because we have yet in the wind that passes like 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:35.889
 that in the prostate 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:37.430
 so the picture 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.920
 the montages of nature again this scenario remains opca the men are 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:44.330
 particularly impressive in italy 8 euros against 8 note the return 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.159
 ice-creams 

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:49.159
 alassane ouattara we hate and it gives 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.680
 but this rarity 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.520
 but a few days ago that the prepa that had met and karayannides 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.820
 it's the conductor 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.710
 the German had been trapped 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.570
 yes I will observe 

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.200
 effect was engaged on the front 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.490
 my guys who played on a little cloud and that 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.180
 it's true that in front of a little bit a global actor autumn +48 issue 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.449
 a you are invited to lend they were engaged for them concertos 

00:06:42.119 --> 00:06:45.589
 a bit short of bartok apparently my directory for your articles of 

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:46.009
 statutes 

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:46.889
 challenge
