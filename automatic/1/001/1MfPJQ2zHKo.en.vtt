00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.040
 hello everyone today try 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:12.740
 restore 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:17.360
 a piece of plastic here kawasaki motorcycle 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.360
 he seems to be more than once 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.210
 faced with this issue this plastic 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:28.930
 and traces of frequent repairs 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:36.600
 on the face here well how would he have got me 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:42.840
 hands for the first time so now crack 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:49.270
 so how would i repair 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:53.580
 this plastic for the first time here for 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:01:00.210
 i need a soldering iron 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:01:04.089
 ordinary household soldering iron 25 that's how 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:09.000
 it would be possible and 35 wadded well there is 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:20.620
 Only 20 such here therefore ask 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:25.270
 you can proceed to the whole 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:32.100
 plastic we need to tighten the edges smoothly 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:32.100
 so that they fit as closely as possible and 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.939
 try to fix warming up 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:49.429
 warming up the seam creating a seam here 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:04.049
 create a seam that will be a club tight 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:06.829
 firmly hold the two halves now we 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:15.379
 wait until it cools down a little and 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:15.379
 let's continue the way the easiest 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.840
 let's say the case of first necessity 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.180
 you can not take advantage of 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.989
 There are many different ways to water 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.379
 plastic and then it depends on the types 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:37.790
 plastic year ultimate goal 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:46.099
 a number of other factors but in this case 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:53.519
 this wing is the back fender of motorcycles but 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:59.250
 subject to decent vibration but 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:03:06.680
 therefore different loads 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:12.810
 suffer most often and repair 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:16.709
 need from time to time but edges like 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:19.069
 a little bit not quite agree well judging 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.069
 throughout 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:34.100
 here but it's not critical since after 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:40.280
 sanding followed priming sanding and 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:43.970
 painting the wing and all these irregularities 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.960
 will be expressed using ground 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.960
 putty 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.680
 the principle of soldering is quite simple 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:10.210
 in the middle 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:11.520
 cracks warms up almost to 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:18.070
 the end 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:23.370
 plastic creating the same wavelike your 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:31.560
 and then 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:37.930
 smoothes down before it gets cold this 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:39.640
 later will help to grind less with 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.760
 one side on the other hand more 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:45.820
 Aesthetically, Ritz create if allowed 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.060
 I will need further refinement and 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:51.340
 well, the crack is small 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:55.540
 simple soldering is not enough seam 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:58.300
 It is recommended to warm up more accurately to solder from 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:02.770
 base itself to the end seamlessly 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:05.890
 since the plastic which has been heated 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:12.190
 has time to cool down know work 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:14.050
 will have to be done twice, that's why with 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:18.930
 in short intervals 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:26.830
 plastic is like in this case then 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:28.860
 fill in the remaining places with the same 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.860
 way 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.550
 here 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:20.390
 Well, the principle is almost finished 

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:31.130
 left hurt 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:31.130
 several millimeters and essentially work 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:51.170
 completed you need to let it cool after 

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:51.170
 Why grind putty and paint 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:08.850
 that is, the principle turned out 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:17.070
 neat enough neatly complicated 

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:20.060
 there is no as you can see the load holds 

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:20.060
 at this stage 

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:29.690
 how would you repeat the procedure with 

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:29.690
 back side since 

00:07:32.809 --> 00:07:43.379
 the crack is serious enough if it got away 

00:07:38.729 --> 00:07:46.799
 walked came together well and how to decorate not 

00:07:43.379 --> 00:07:54.569
 need, in principle, worked count 

00:07:46.799 --> 00:07:55.969
 finished so solder and do not be afraid 

00:07:54.569 --> 00:07:59.639
 expect 

00:07:55.969 --> 00:08:02.359
 kisses will work thank you for your attention 

00:07:59.639 --> 00:08:02.359
 good luck
