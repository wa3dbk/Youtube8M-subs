collection and the concept behind it was

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.650 
collection and the concept behind it was
we<00:02:24.390> want<00:02:24.600> to<00:02:24.720> give<00:02:25.020> the<00:02:26.060> contributors<00:02:27.060> at

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
we want to give the contributors at

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:34.210 
we want to give the contributors at

intensive more intensive kind of shoots

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.620 
intensive more intensive kind of shoots
things<00:02:38.100> that<00:02:38.310> take<00:02:38.760> more<00:02:39.000> time<00:02:39.239> to<00:02:39.270> develop

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
things that take more time to develop

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.090 
things that take more time to develop
things<00:02:39.989> that<00:02:40.260> have<00:02:40.770> more<00:02:42.680> risky<00:02:43.680> kind<00:02:43.980> of

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
things that have more risky kind of

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.740 
things that have more risky kind of
concepts<00:02:44.850> and<00:02:45.840> kind<00:02:46.739> of<00:02:46.830> do<00:02:47.459> two<00:02:47.670> things<00:02:47.940> first

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
concepts and kind of do two things first

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.920 
concepts and kind of do two things first
of<00:02:48.870> all<00:02:49.610> give<00:02:50.610> people<00:02:51.030> an<00:02:51.300> outlet<00:02:51.630> for<00:02:51.660> the

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
not have done in the past because you

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.180 
not have done in the past because you
thought<00:03:14.190> that's<00:03:14.910> that's<00:03:15.269> a<00:03:15.390> little<00:03:15.690> too<00:03:15.870> much
