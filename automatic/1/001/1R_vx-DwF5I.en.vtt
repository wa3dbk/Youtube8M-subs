00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:09.190 
I read a quote by you it says losers

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.750 
I read a quote by you it says losers
have<00:00:09.610> tons<00:00:10.030> of<00:00:10.300> variety<00:00:11.190> champions<00:00:12.190> just<00:00:12.550> take

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:12.760 
have tons of variety champions just take

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.850 
have tons of variety champions just take
pride<00:00:13.120> in<00:00:13.150> learning<00:00:13.630> to<00:00:13.900> hit<00:00:14.080> the<00:00:14.260> same<00:00:14.530> old

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:14.860 
pride in learning to hit the same old

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:15.960 
pride in learning to hit the same old
boring<00:00:15.130> shot

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:15.970 
boring shot

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.750 
boring shot
yeah<00:00:16.510> the<00:00:16.930> physics<00:00:17.650> remains<00:00:18.070> the<00:00:18.250> same<00:00:18.520> you

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:18.760 
yeah the physics remains the same you

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.850 
yeah the physics remains the same you
don't<00:00:18.910> you're<00:00:19.779> not<00:00:19.810> playing<00:00:20.230> a<00:00:20.320> new<00:00:20.500> sport

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:20.860 
don't you're not playing a new sport

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.250 
don't you're not playing a new sport
every<00:00:21.160> day<00:00:21.360> what<00:00:22.360> you're<00:00:22.510> trying<00:00:22.780> to<00:00:22.869> do<00:00:23.080> is

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:23.260 
every day what you're trying to do is

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.950 
every day what you're trying to do is
keep<00:00:23.470> it<00:00:23.619> simple<00:00:23.680> which<00:00:24.610> is<00:00:24.640> your<00:00:25.029> theme<00:00:25.300> you

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
keep it simple which is your theme you

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.590 
keep it simple which is your theme you
know<00:00:25.990> keep<00:00:26.350> it<00:00:26.500> simple<00:00:26.529> and<00:00:27.100> then<00:00:27.730> get<00:00:28.119> right

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:28.600 
know keep it simple and then get right

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.840 
know keep it simple and then get right
to<00:00:28.779> the<00:00:28.900> point<00:00:29.080> fast<00:00:29.470> and<00:00:29.859> that's<00:00:30.430> the<00:00:30.640> thing

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:30.850 
to the point fast and that's the thing

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.880 
to the point fast and that's the thing
about<00:00:31.090> physics<00:00:31.570> a<00:00:31.900> don't<00:00:32.140> change<00:00:32.500> you<00:00:32.680> don't

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
about physics a don't change you don't

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.670 
about physics a don't change you don't
have<00:00:33.309> a<00:00:33.340> new<00:00:33.520> physical<00:00:33.760> law<00:00:34.270> about<00:00:35.199> how<00:00:35.440> to<00:00:35.500> hit

it's very well known now and there's

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.580 
it's very well known now and there's
still<00:00:48.969> people<00:00:49.180> who<00:00:49.390> think<00:00:49.600> they<00:00:49.719> can<00:00:49.899> do<00:00:50.020> funny

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
still people who think they can do funny

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.770 
still people who think they can do funny
things<00:00:50.950> to<00:00:51.040> the<00:00:51.280> ball<00:00:51.520> and<00:00:51.730> they<00:00:51.879> can't<00:00:52.210> they

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
things to the ball and they can't they

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.139 
things to the ball and they can't they
violate<00:00:53.200> physical<00:00:53.739> laws<00:00:53.920> they<00:00:54.640> haven't<00:00:54.940> won<00:00:55.090> a

violate physical laws they haven't won a
match<00:00:55.390> since<00:00:55.750> 38<00:00:56.350> and<00:00:56.829> so<00:00:57.750> but<00:00:58.750> the<00:00:58.899> kids<00:00:59.140> who

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
you stay the man you are I think the

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.520 
you stay the man you are I think the
best<00:01:46.240> thing<00:01:46.479> I've<00:01:46.630> ever<00:01:46.660> learned<00:01:47.080> is<00:01:47.349> how

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
best thing I've ever learned is how

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.889 
best thing I've ever learned is how
small<00:01:47.920> we<00:01:48.190> are<00:01:48.220> in<00:01:48.550> this<00:01:48.670> world<00:01:48.970> not<00:01:49.179> how<00:01:49.630> big

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
small we are in this world not how big

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.609 
small we are in this world not how big
now<00:01:52.899> I<00:01:52.929> came<00:01:53.050> from<00:01:53.380> a<00:01:53.530> very<00:01:53.709> poor<00:01:53.830> family<00:01:54.099> and<00:01:54.700> I

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
now I came from a very poor family and I

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.930 
now I came from a very poor family and I
really<00:01:56.619> learned<00:01:56.830> very<00:01:57.069> early<00:01:57.130> that

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
really learned very early that

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.419 
really learned very early that
opportunity<00:01:58.780> doesn't<00:01:59.410> knock<00:01:59.619> all<00:02:00.039> the<00:02:00.160> time

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
opportunity doesn't knock all the time

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:02.940 
opportunity doesn't knock all the time
and<00:02:00.640> to<00:02:00.729> give<00:02:00.910> kids<00:02:01.179> opportunities<00:02:01.360> is<00:02:02.229> the

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
and to give kids opportunities is the

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.820 
and to give kids opportunities is the
