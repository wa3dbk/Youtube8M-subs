00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.310

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:47.180

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:52.910

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.790
 I like it here I do not know what to compare with 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.060
 creams do not compare do not compare 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:25.210

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.430
 how do you use for example day and then 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.740

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:55.229

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.530
 I do not know what to convey than to compare 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.690
 but some kind of herbal such here 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.060
 citrus is not even numbers 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.660
 it is difficult to understand it is necessary once 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:39.970
 Something like this is this 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:47.230
 powder she she in my even without shades 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:50.800
 it goes well for all skin types 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.690
 here is her sponge here 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.060
 written very doctor hauschka 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.510
 and he is here as a reason to minutes 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:04.930
 This is a cotton disk than we remove makeup 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:08.650
 here is his such color here such 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:12.150
 But she such you know as valka 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:15.840
 lies on the face on the skin 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:18.390
 Here I have skin problems but very 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.079
 pronounced acne it was peeling yet 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.260
 anything and here she does not emphasize 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.790
 disadvantages but if you 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:30.120
 fears if you are very so very 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.879
 pimply is a group say yes or well here 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.939
 very hard flakes skin on the nose or 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:38.099
 somewhere else, then maybe I donâ€™t know 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:40.319
 do get thinking about the same i repeat 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:42.900
 not very problem skin on pimples all 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:48.200
 and listen a little bit i have names 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:51.090
 underlines her smell 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.329
 I even said it smells almost nothing 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.180
 just a little bit like that 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:59.400
 here is this fudge smell and thin 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:03.480
 legenky even here now again 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.280
 it is clear that we reminded me like powder 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.159
 powder smells a little bit of powder and 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.549
 a little bit somehow helped as well 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:15.299
 the next one is this 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:19.459
 eyes are generally a miracle 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:23.729
 I mean what I enjoyed here 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:29.669
 Over on how much from 25 years up 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:31.410
 I use now 29 and 4 he I 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:35.550
 went through a lot of any creams 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.990
 both natural and neutral and luxury 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.900
 deluxe room 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.430
 massmarket and this is probably the best 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.610
 that i'm my own 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:50.380
 in practice I tried how I like 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:52.330
 it moisturizes and nourishes not even 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:05:00.070
 mimic wrinkles stood up seems to me 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:05:00.610
 less but how to say bags and bruises under 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.160
 eyes 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.680
 he does not remove them as they were 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.910
 Well, as for moistening and aversion 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.500

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:15.490
 super remedy and here I am this remedy 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:18.600
 Recently bought it so now I will say that 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:23.830
 we have it we have hair oil 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:24.970

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.400

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:30.580
 dandruff and hair loss 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:35.410
 and also who often dries his hair here and 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:39.340
 the rest was an indicator of what 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:41.560
 it would be very important for me I have not yet 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.320
 I used to look here 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.740
 if neither can be seen 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:49.470
 on here such genital sediment but 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:56.930
 it is normal and it is a natural remedy 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:06:00.920
 so there this one is not imam called 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.920
 weed or what i don't know 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:09.580
 just about oil is like butter exactly like 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:15.660
 water as a tonic and on the hair roots will be 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:18.130
 I donâ€™t know how to go 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:21.760
 In general, here are my ones so far 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:23.770
 buying from this wonderful company 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.510
 Dr. hauschka can say that I 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.320
 I use and will be 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:29.320
 to use 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:32.650
 firstly because it is natural 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:35.140
 cosmetics secondly i like it by 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:37.230
 smell but i translate if you smell them 

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.230
 and 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:46.949
 even how I smell it at all some 

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:46.949
 unobtrusively have a smell but he is such 

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:54.099
 natural nice and here is some 

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:56.050
 even here by the way here's lipstick 

00:06:54.099 --> 00:06:58.990
 that's when I can't fall asleep 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:02.229
 for some reason I am smearing my lips with this paper 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:06.449
 and falling asleep fast knows about the smell on 

00:07:02.229 --> 00:07:10.539
 it works for me 

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:13.090
 we know I am very pleased and if you are not 

00:07:10.539 --> 00:07:15.270
 would ask some product to buy 

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:20.620

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:24.400

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:35.639
 problem skin probably still 

00:07:31.569 --> 00:07:38.830
