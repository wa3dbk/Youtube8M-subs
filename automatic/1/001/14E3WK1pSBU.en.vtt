again<00:03:04.370> it<00:03:04.610> takes<00:03:04.790> a<00:03:04.850> little<00:03:04.970> bit<00:03:05.090> of<00:03:05.209> practice

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
again it takes a little bit of practice

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.940 
again it takes a little bit of practice
to<00:03:05.630> build<00:03:05.810> up<00:03:06.020> that<00:03:06.170> flexibility<00:03:06.800> and

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
to build up that flexibility and

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.370 
to build up that flexibility and
everything<00:03:07.190> else<00:03:07.280> once<00:03:08.090> you<00:03:08.180> get<00:03:08.330> done<00:03:08.570> then<00:03:08.990> I

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
everything else once you get done then I

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.680 
everything else once you get done then I
mean<00:03:09.650> it's<00:03:09.770> a<00:03:09.830> fantastic<00:03:09.950> exercise<00:03:10.630> for<00:03:11.630> the

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
mean it's a fantastic exercise for the

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.030 
mean it's a fantastic exercise for the
entire<00:03:11.959> back<00:03:12.170> and<00:03:12.350> really<00:03:12.590> helps<00:03:12.770> strengthen

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
entire back and really helps strengthen

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.160 
entire back and really helps strengthen

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
notice this strength carryover in

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.110 
notice this strength carryover in
exercises<00:03:17.270> like<00:03:17.420> squats<00:03:17.739> deadlifts<00:03:18.739> and

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
exercises like squats deadlifts and

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.220

basically every exercise you can do

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.320 
basically every exercise you can do
because<00:03:21.530> it<00:03:21.650> gives<00:03:21.800> you<00:03:21.890> a<00:03:21.950> strong<00:03:22.250> solid<00:03:22.910> core

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330
