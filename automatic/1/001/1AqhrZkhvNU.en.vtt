16<00:06:05.500> I<00:06:05.849> think<00:06:06.849> this<00:06:06.940> is<00:06:07.000> problem<00:06:07.419> though<00:06:07.719> no<00:06:08.680> not

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
16 I think this is problem though no not

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.430 
16 I think this is problem though no not
even<00:06:09.400> that<00:06:09.490> expensive<00:06:09.669> dude<00:06:10.120> 16<00:06:11.110> bucks<00:06:11.289> or

even that expensive dude 16 bucks or

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.619 
even that expensive dude 16 bucks or
something<00:06:11.529> dope<00:06:12.029> I'll<00:06:13.029> take<00:06:13.270> that<00:06:13.389> any<00:06:13.449> day
