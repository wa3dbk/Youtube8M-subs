00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.830 
dancer she was in a very lean back
position<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.489> just<00:00:35.730> focused<00:00:36.090> on<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.329> legs<00:00:36.540> so

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
position I just focused on the legs so

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.160 
position I just focused on the legs so
for<00:00:37.530> me<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.920> lot<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.309> my<00:00:38.460> works<00:00:38.969> not<00:00:39.300> amount<00:00:40.110> of

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
for me a lot of my works not amount of

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.500 
for me a lot of my works not amount of
type<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.579> paint<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.760> they're<00:00:41.910> charcoal<00:00:42.329> or

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
type of paint and they're charcoal or

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.170 
type of paint and they're charcoal or
about<00:00:42.719> people<00:00:43.559> about<00:00:44.250> people<00:00:44.610> in<00:00:44.700> spaces

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
about people about people in spaces

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.959 
about people about people in spaces
these<00:00:45.930> pieces<00:00:46.170> are<00:00:46.320> more<00:00:46.800> about<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.579> object

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
these pieces are more about the object

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.420 
these pieces are more about the object
and<00:00:48.090> sort<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.360> permanence<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.110> memory<00:00:50.100> its<00:00:50.340> a

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
and sort of permanence and memory its a

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.340 
and sort of permanence and memory its a
mix<00:00:50.610> between<00:00:50.820> hard<00:00:51.570> ground<00:00:51.750> etching<00:00:52.110> and

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
mix between hard ground etching and

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.590 
mix between hard ground etching and
these<00:00:52.770> photo<00:00:53.129> transfers<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.090> then<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:54.539> is

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
these photo transfers and then this is

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.979 
these photo transfers and then this is
both<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:55.079> them<00:00:55.170> together<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:57.149> coil<00:00:57.780> pot

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
both of them together this is a coil pot

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.830 
both of them together this is a coil pot
so<00:00:58.350> it's<00:00:58.530> kind<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.739> like<00:00:58.920> those<00:00:59.660> those<00:01:00.660> like<00:01:00.780> a

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
so it's kind of like those those like a

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.200 
so it's kind of like those those like a
patch<00:01:01.140> be<00:01:01.530> made<00:01:01.680> first<00:01:01.949> grade<00:01:02.280> with<00:01:02.699> like<00:01:02.940> be

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
patch be made first grade with like be

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.080 
patch be made first grade with like be
like<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:04.260> pinch<00:01:04.619> pads<00:01:04.890> it's<00:01:05.670> actually<00:01:05.790> a

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
like this pinch pads it's actually a

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.030 
like this pinch pads it's actually a
b-boy<00:01:06.479> which<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.260> completely<00:01:07.590> different

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
piece but it was my first it started out

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.660 
piece but it was my first it started out
as<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.180> photo<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.930> then<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.710> printed<00:01:32.280> on<00:01:32.400> an

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
as a photo and then you printed on an

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.640 
as a photo and then you printed on an
inkjet<00:01:33.150> printer<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.840> then<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.439> do<00:01:34.560> this

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
inkjet printer and then you do this

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.370 
inkjet printer and then you do this
transfer<00:01:35.040> processes<00:01:35.430> it's<00:01:36.240> um<00:01:36.570> each<00:01:37.140> one<00:01:37.350> a

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
transfer processes it's um each one a

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.450 
transfer processes it's um each one a
sort<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.560> difference<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:37.920> their<00:01:38.040> monotypes

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
sort of difference of their monotypes

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.749 
sort of difference of their monotypes
call<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.500> giant<00:01:40.500> triangular<00:01:41.189> wooden<00:01:41.520> piece

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
call the giant triangular wooden piece

geometrical

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
geometrical

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.840 
geometrical
fashion<00:01:43.300> I<00:01:43.600> think<00:01:44.230> it's<00:01:44.500> both<00:01:44.710> debts<00:01:45.010> and

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.540 

fluid<00:01:48.850> yeah<00:01:49.660> at<00:01:50.620> first<00:01:50.680> I<00:01:51.070> like<00:01:51.280> really

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
fluid yeah at first I like really

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.400 
fluid yeah at first I like really
artificial<00:01:52.180> light<00:01:52.360> just<00:01:52.870> because<00:01:53.200> i<00:01:53.350> think

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
artificial light just because i think

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.910 
artificial light just because i think
it's<00:01:53.890> brighter<00:01:54.700> and<00:01:55.000> I<00:01:55.090> like<00:01:55.300> the<00:01:56.230> stark

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
it's brighter and I like the stark

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.040 
it's brighter and I like the stark
contrast<00:01:57.450> especially<00:01:58.450> in<00:01:58.570> my<00:01:58.690> charcoal

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
contrast especially in my charcoal

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.050 
contrast especially in my charcoal
pieces<00:01:59.410> I<00:01:59.500> like<00:01:59.710> getting<00:01:59.920> their<00:02:00.520> really<00:02:00.820> dark

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
pieces I like getting their really dark

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.390 
pieces I like getting their really dark
darks<00:02:01.480> and<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:02.140> light<00:02:02.320> lights<00:02:02.590> and<00:02:02.890> erasing

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
darks and the light lights and erasing

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.670 
darks and the light lights and erasing
out<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:03.670> light<00:02:03.850> so<00:02:04.150> that<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:05.290> creates<00:02:05.590> a

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
out the light so that it creates a

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.460 
out the light so that it creates a
contrast<00:02:06.130> on<00:02:06.370> the<00:02:06.490> page<00:02:06.990> hang<00:02:07.990> on<00:02:08.140> how<00:02:08.229> hard

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
contrast on the page hang on how hard

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.169 
contrast on the page hang on how hard
you<00:02:08.530> rub<00:02:08.800> on<00:02:08.950> certain<00:02:09.220> colors<00:02:09.490> like<00:02:09.670> if<00:02:10.090> you

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
you rub on certain colors like if you

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.970 
you rub on certain colors like if you
