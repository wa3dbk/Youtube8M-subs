00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
the morning and you just don't have time

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.000 
the morning and you just don't have time
and<00:02:27.790> it's<00:02:28.000> just<00:02:28.269> very<00:02:28.359> effective<00:02:29.200> because

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
and it's just very effective because

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.800 
and it's just very effective because
basically<00:02:30.489> you're<00:02:30.819> just<00:02:31.030> covering<00:02:31.180> all<00:02:31.630> your

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
basically you're just covering all your

basically you're just covering all your
imperfections<00:02:32.079> and<00:02:34.349> targeting<00:02:35.349> them<00:02:35.560> all<00:02:35.799> at

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
imperfections and targeting them all at

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.099 
imperfections and targeting them all at
once<00:02:36.220> what<00:02:36.549> rather<00:02:37.060> than<00:02:37.329> just<00:02:37.599> dotting<00:02:37.870> it

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:38.109 
once what rather than just dotting it

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:40.319 
once what rather than just dotting it
everywhere<00:02:38.560> and<00:02:38.859> then<00:02:39.040> just<00:02:39.790> going<00:02:39.940> one<00:02:40.180> by

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
everywhere and then just going one by

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:46.710 
everywhere and then just going one by
one<00:02:43.170> so<00:02:44.170> here<00:02:44.410> you're<00:02:44.590> just<00:02:45.299> attacking<00:02:46.299> them

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
one so here you're just attacking them

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.550 
one so here you're just attacking them
all<00:02:46.840> at<00:02:46.989> once<00:02:48.660> so<00:02:49.660> just<00:02:49.870> blend<00:02:50.049> it<00:02:50.230> out<00:02:50.349> like

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
all at once so just blend it out like

00:02:50.560 --> 00:03:00.089 
all at once so just blend it out like
that

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.130 

sometimes<00:03:00.849> I<00:03:00.969> just<00:03:01.000> like<00:03:01.239> to<00:03:01.299> go<00:03:01.569> back<00:03:01.750> just<00:03:02.019> to

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
sometimes I just like to go back just to

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.670 
sometimes I just like to go back just to
reap<00:03:02.409> at<00:03:02.620> it<00:03:02.799> just<00:03:03.430> so<00:03:03.730> I<00:03:04.209> can<00:03:04.959> make<00:03:05.140> sure<00:03:05.439> that

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
reap at it just so I can make sure that

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.349 
reap at it just so I can make sure that
I<00:03:05.890> blended<00:03:06.459> it<00:03:06.609> all<00:03:06.819> out<00:03:08.939> because<00:03:09.939> you<00:03:10.239> don't

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359 
I blended it all out because you don't

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:15.899 
I blended it all out because you don't
want<00:03:10.599> packages<00:03:11.439> of<00:03:11.620> concealer<00:03:13.739> but<00:03:14.739> you<00:03:15.010> like

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:15.909 
want packages of concealer but you like

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:18.929 
want packages of concealer but you like
that<00:03:16.470> and<00:03:17.470> sometimes<00:03:17.859> I<00:03:17.980> just<00:03:18.040> like<00:03:18.400> to<00:03:18.609> go<00:03:18.760> up

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:18.939 
that and sometimes I just like to go up

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:24.720 
that and sometimes I just like to go up
and<00:03:19.150> down<00:03:21.540> like<00:03:22.540> so<00:03:22.870> and<00:03:23.170> after<00:03:23.859> I<00:03:24.069> do<00:03:24.159> that<00:03:24.310> I

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
and down like so and after I do that I

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.509 
and down like so and after I do that I
usually<00:03:25.269> just<00:03:26.019> go<00:03:26.560> back<00:03:26.739> in<00:03:27.040> with<00:03:27.280> the

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
usually just go back in with the

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.599 
usually just go back in with the
concealer<00:03:27.849> and<00:03:28.239> just<00:03:28.269> dot<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:30.489> other

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
concealer and just dot the other

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:35.970 
concealer and just dot the other
imperfections<00:03:30.969> that<00:03:31.480> I<00:03:31.510> missed<00:03:34.620> right<00:03:35.620> there

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
imperfections that I missed right there

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.580 
imperfections that I missed right there

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.599 
here and then this little bump there
little<00:03:42.549> redness<00:03:43.030> here<00:03:43.889> and<00:03:44.889> then<00:03:45.040> sometimes<00:03:45.430> I

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:45.609 
little redness here and then sometimes I

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.809

would<00:03:45.790> like<00:03:46.000> to<00:03:46.299> I<00:03:46.720> like<00:03:47.500> to<00:03:47.650> put<00:03:47.889> a<00:03:47.950> line<00:03:48.159> on<00:03:48.579> my

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
would like to I like to put a line on my

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.319 
would like to I like to put a line on my
nose<00:03:48.970> just<00:03:49.269> to<00:03:49.359> highlight<00:03:49.540> that<00:03:49.870> area<00:03:51.329> and

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
nose just to highlight that area and

00:03:52.329 --> 00:04:03.710 
nose just to highlight that area and
just<00:03:52.389> a<00:03:52.569> little<00:03:52.810> bit<00:03:52.930> more<00:03:53.079> coverage<00:03:53.290> that<00:03:53.739> way

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.630 

so<00:04:38.580> I<00:04:38.670> just<00:04:38.910> dab<00:04:39.150> it<00:04:39.330> and<00:04:39.570> swirl<00:04:40.500> it<00:04:40.650> around<00:04:40.740> to

so I just dab it and swirl it around to

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.760 
so I just dab it and swirl it around to
get<00:04:41.760> some<00:04:41.940> product<00:04:42.390> so<00:04:43.020> you<00:04:43.110> don't<00:04:43.260> need<00:04:43.350> too

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770

too<00:04:43.980> much<00:04:44.190> just<00:04:44.640> a<00:04:44.730> little<00:04:44.970> bit<00:04:49.700> and<00:04:50.700> then<00:04:51.030> I

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
too much just a little bit and then I

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.910 
too much just a little bit and then I
just<00:04:51.360> start<00:04:51.630> from<00:04:51.780> the<00:04:51.900> center<00:04:52.260> and<00:04:52.410> work<00:04:52.470> my

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
just start from the center and work my

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.980 
just start from the center and work my
way<00:04:53.040> out<00:04:53.220> because<00:04:53.520> that's<00:04:54.000> where<00:04:54.390> most<00:04:54.660> of<00:04:54.840> the

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
way out because that's where most of the

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.880 
way out because that's where most of the
concealer<00:04:55.710> was<00:04:56.160> applied<00:04:57.110> so<00:04:58.110> I<00:04:58.140> just<00:04:58.380> swirl<00:04:58.740> it

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
concealer was applied so I just swirl it

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.320
