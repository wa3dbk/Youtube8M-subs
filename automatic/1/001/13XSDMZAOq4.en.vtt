00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:07.420
 a little on the defensive because he must already 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:09.820
 feel like mistreated as marginalized 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.889
 more was left with a lot of anger is that 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.610
 It was not very nice, she was with me 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:18.520
 very unfriendly of stating that I do not 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.649
 it was Venezuelan that I carry rauch and not 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.320
 it was Venezuelan itself all 

00:00:20.649 --> 00:00:25.029
 injustices defeated osuna a 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.279
 little girl beat a whole 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.279
 organization that for my wall 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.820
 the castle went through many 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.920
 vicissitudes in his journey through the 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:41.199
 contest but it was before the miss 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.199
 universe that suffered its greatest disappointment 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.100
 In the universe 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.110
 this is another of the things that I have to 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.280
 thank Carlos andres Perez with 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.750
 everything that people want to talk about 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.510
 Carlos Andres and his wife the 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.330
 president told us like that but if 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.850
 you alone do not travel outside of Venezuela and 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.320
 second things are going to bring him and he called 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.180
 over the phone he said they called 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.120
 phone and they sent him the tickets on 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.900
 itinerary and all of the miss universe for 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.900
 that I could have it 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.920
 the castle was supported by the 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.500
 president of the republic and he went to 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.170
 hong kong to represent venezuela in 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.290
 the miss universe for the first time I 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.340
 I was watching a miss universe and 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.840
 talking about her because when you saw 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.460
 was the first finalist with the other and 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.460
 I said and it's much prettier she won 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.049
 but the other one is you know that sometimes in 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.240
 those international competitions there 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.990
 good policy questions indeed 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.560
 we just finished the theater to check everything 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.270
 that nothing had happened 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.250
 the food to be his grotto null and 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.150
 we go well and nothing she is a woman 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:52.480
 Precious is a very intelligent woman 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:54.610
 a very prepared girl who managed 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.810
 is to be first runner-up in the 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.080
 same universe and because he already had the 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.560
 vivacity of learning one thing in 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.560
 Cantonese 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.520
 and I would not have done it because to me 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:14.450
 contest I did not really care about 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:17.240
 one part and the other because that is not 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.730
 it was my passion and theirs and then 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.560
 that's why I was very happy for her 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.050
 this castle managed to be first 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.390
 finalist of the miss universe before the 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.570
 incredulous glance of the organizers 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.670
 from miss Venezuela and yet I 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:35.740
 I thought part of that 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.770
 venezuela I wanted to say good there 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.450
 they have the bold 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.020
 from so much talking an evil they can to 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.190
 have to say it 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:51.090
 when I arrived I had everything 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:53.590
 of reception in marketing 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.360
 but he came he knows 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.360
 with the ego very 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.430
 I loved it 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:10.730
 and unfortunately they come to embrace 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:13.730
 in front of all journalists thanks 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.730
 Thank you 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:24.600
 in the year 1976 was the rebellion of the 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.120
 women with personality one that I fight 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.730
 for demonstrating that the impositions do not 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.090
 they go hand in hand with her and another that I fight 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:37.100
 to be respected in a bit of what 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.100
 that I have had that has not allowed 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.590
 no man mistreats me 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.510
 maybe there are women who do 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.400
 maybe there are fabulous men out there 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.300
 but sometimes I wonder if really 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.920
 warm 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.890
 is in love 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.770
 I say like a person who listens 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.480
 a little bit ago I do not have a filter between 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:04.110
 brain and the tongue or I say what 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.709
 I think and if I think that a girl like 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.640
 I 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.640
 Never 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.759
 You are a peraza with that tenacity and firmness 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:19.190
 that characterizes it managed to become 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:21.859
 one of the most acclaimed actresses in 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.229
 country while judy castle followed 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.210
 giving voice to the weakest he studied 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:29.509
 right and managed to be one of the lawyers 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.699
 Venezuela brightest of their lives 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:34.280
 they were crossed by the crown more 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:37.610
 wanted from the country but each one gave 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:41.050
 your destination an original and marked course 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.050
 for the authenticity 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:49.110
 because the crown weighs a lot and so does not 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.110
 They have informed our queens 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.650
 so that a program lasts 20 years being 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.870
 successful in the air there is only one formula 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.450
 first count on the mother of the 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.990
 Venezuelan television an internship a 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.990

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.940
 gonzález 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:18.849
 and a divine fun and now that in the 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:22.300
 year-old client dances as he dances sings like 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:25.780

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:28.569
 do when you have 20 seconds to have one 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:31.180
 of the most visible and loved faces 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:32.560
 already from our screen no one shows 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.120
 no fear 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.599
 nobody can be like how much the show is worth 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.819
 who is looking for a different formula 109 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:42.940
 different that have the same result I 

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:45.069
 I am the tuna because I love cats and 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.870
 you sing a cat in the dark and 

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:51.230
 all my cat the stars meowing horita 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:53.210
 in the house for his show 10,000 bolivars 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.310
 third to have one of the great 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:58.130
 values ​​of singing in Latin America 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:02.680
 average in the pool in the program 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.680
 television of all Latin America alone 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.640
 a sweet dark ring very manly worthy 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:17.240
 for the romantic songs of weights 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:20.300
 fourth enjoy the wickedness and jocosity of 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:22.910
 denisse hernandez malandra elisabeth 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.950
 after how much show is worth it is that he came 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.530
 everything else 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:29.700
 and I think that in the program how much 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:32.220
 worth the show always tried 

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:34.950
 and I'm going to talk including myself 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:37.250
 mistreated the participants but with 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.250
 respect 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.759
 the happiness that I feel when I 

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:44.759
 it would not 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:50.820
 in just two minutes either dancing 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.770
 singing reciting no matter what 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.540
 how much the show's worth served 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.720
 for more than two decades as 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:59.730
 platform for hundreds of artists 

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.950
 Venezuelans a formula expanded by the 

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:04.110
 television in the whole world but it was 

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:06.510
 venezuela with its creator guillermo 

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:08.700
 fantastic gonzález that would give him success 

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:11.330
 to a great television idea that was born in 

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:14.550
 the 80s and according to him was vilely 

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:16.260
 reproduced and plagiarized concepts 

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.990
 international as american idol 

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:21.210
 factor x and the voice according to fantastic 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:23.160
 gonzález were shot of his idea 

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:25.410
 original and so he stated in the newspaper 

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:28.290
 'the universal' in January of this year 

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:30.840
 but remember how it started 

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:32.510
 this story this started in the in the 

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:36.920
 channel lot 

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:40.700
 and then a choice and someone 

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:43.460
 He spoke and there was myth, I walked through the 

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:45.800
 corridors radio caracas television in 

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.310
 that helpless moment without knowing 

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.390
 what to do 

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:52.070
 it's like I'm without good you're like 

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:54.770
 desperate not that was when they threw me 

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:57.140
 radio caracas television because I do not 

00:07:54.770 --> 00:08:01.330
 because the director was not told and how to 

00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:01.330
 the week my name is guillermo gonzález 

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:05.600
 the truth always comes to light 

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:08.990
 do not miss 

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:12.160
 on the way back I had an accident in the 

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:12.160
 accident died half
