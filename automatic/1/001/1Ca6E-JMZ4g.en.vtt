in this is don't don't just come into it

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.460 
in this is don't don't just come into it
thinking<00:00:23.010> you<00:00:23.160> can<00:00:23.310> just<00:00:23.490> run<00:00:24.390> up<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.810> do<00:00:24.930> do

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
thinking you can just run up and do do

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.720 
thinking you can just run up and do do
the<00:00:25.619> trick<00:00:25.890> like<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.310> have<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.609> have

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
preparation you're going to know how it

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.990 
preparation you're going to know how it
works

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
works

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.609 
works
the<00:00:30.000> most<00:00:30.359> obvious<00:00:30.539> mistake<00:00:31.080> that<00:00:31.199> people<00:00:31.349> go

the most obvious mistake that people go

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.610 
the most obvious mistake that people go
is<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.099> run-up<00:00:32.430> they'll<00:00:32.700> just<00:00:33.180> go<00:00:33.270> like<00:00:33.450> this

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.590 

and<00:00:37.620> just<00:00:37.920> try<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.100> do<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.460> there's<00:00:39.149> an<00:00:39.300> actual

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
and just try and do it there's an actual

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
and just try and do it there's an actual
run<00:00:39.780> up<00:00:39.930> um<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.850> go<00:00:41.850> around<00:00:42.000> in<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.450> J<00:00:42.719> it's<00:00:43.050> four

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
run up um you go around in a J it's four

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.819 
run up um you go around in a J it's four
steps<00:00:43.890> hence<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.969> name<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.420> J<00:00:45.600> step<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.649> I'll

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
steps hence the name the J step and I'll

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:47.990 
steps hence the name the J step and I'll
just<00:00:47.010> quickly<00:00:47.160> show<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.520> what<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.700> looks
