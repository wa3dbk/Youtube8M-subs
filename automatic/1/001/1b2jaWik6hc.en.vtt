00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.240
 this tutorial I explain to you like that 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.730
 kof legends can change the web and 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.140
 Although the look of the map and I want 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.439
 Also explain how you do that 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:29.340
 Foreign Ministers and can ensure you go 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:32.890
 Just visit the world.com website 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.079
 and here the kof legions should then 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.170
 you go on maps skins and then look for 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:40.270
 you wanted the webos to change 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:44.230
 once for your one centern 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.579
 odenwald i go on samoa rift this 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.879
 has year I also use most often is 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.559
 that's just now and now 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.660
 you look for someone design out there on you 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.519
 mostly I like love is and how 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:59.739
 most fits now also completely 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:01:01.600
 season and so on and yes for that 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.900
 So you have to install it with that 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.540
 Can you use the scanner ultimate as 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.460
 and just admit it here 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:14.140
 on the right there is a new tab 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:16.210
 open and threaten to get me this 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:21.130
 So let's have a look 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.810
 latest version to pay off so and the 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.810
 fan and i as pose now 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:30.390
 hope the stop a folder the call 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:33.280
 So it is for reseller ultimate and 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.450
 which at the time already finished therefore and 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:40.980
 I'll just pack in the eu 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.530
 folder also takes it to spark again 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.330
 so 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.130
 and now he is nevertheless times the folder 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.440
 rheine that we have packed and 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.900
 now an application should scan here 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:02:01.380
 place ultimate heat which starts her 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:02:04.649
 Just like that and that's how it looks 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.750
 then that's the one at the beginning 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.380
 We invite you to spend a while and we are ready to use it 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.380
 is 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:18.780
 I'll go back to the page 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.620
 here and I hope draws as long 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.630
 will take 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.040
 I just understand the waiting time 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.750
 to 100% always so that has nothing 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.430
 took a few minutes with me 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.360
 but that may be because that 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:36.810
 process is something old and just times 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.269
 further than we wanted so girl now 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.890
 take and you go back for it 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:45.120
 below and I just have it here 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:48.739
 is the first and now you come so what 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.739
 you click on app start 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:58.880
 and yes that is again just because you 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.880
 that again 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:15.300
 yes it should finally be finished so stupid 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.310
 you just confirm that and there 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:23.760
 I just think about it in front of you 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:27.660
 doping if ok and now I'll do it 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.040
 someone hook in and I click to 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:34.170
 Endlauf is with it too 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:39.570
 installed there you get here then 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:41.870
 So do I think nothing can be changed 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:44.430
 can take a while again 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.380
 I'll skip the usual times 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.700
 the video is a bit too big and that 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:52.680
 Of course, it should take a little longer 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:54.209
 upload and yes you know so the whole 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.490
 has now installed too 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.860
 and I'll just turn that off 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:02.240
 change the mini now synonymous and for it 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.240
 the matter is to approach people 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:12.810
 yes, I take that so annoying so you have to 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:15.410
 then click on more and then 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.410
 just here 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.880
 and something happens the same again 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.880
 except that it is a little faster 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.810
 so different that here sometimes 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.800
 he and I show you then immediately 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:52.070
 stayed that's done like that 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:54.300
 whole look and yes so later 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.580
 are back as well as the very nice 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.340
 So now it's changing 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:02.790
 look and that is so white now 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.230
 become and wintry I do not know 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.450
 but I like this map here 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.970
 somehow much more than the boring one 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:11.760
 well start boring well not synonymous 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.540
 but after I find is currently holding is 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:19.140
 makes something boring behind standarten 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:21.450
 and the minions should be different now too 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.490
 look and see differently let's go 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.440
 the minions have a Christmassy 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.760
 Christmas is already over 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.430
 but i know i like that 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.350
 Nevertheless 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.580
 yes and that's it with the 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.900
 video wonder also helped 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.850
 I can gladly thumb up 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.660
 refrain from 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:39.090
 otherwise I would be happy too 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:42.690
 if you leave your feedback and 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:44.760
 if you write further suggestions and 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:47.180
 yes then see it that way until the next one 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.180
 times
