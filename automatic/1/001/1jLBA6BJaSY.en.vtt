this<00:00:01.380> video<00:00:01.709> is<00:00:01.800> going<00:00:01.949> to<00:00:02.010> be<00:00:02.159> over<00:00:02.310> how<00:00:02.550> to

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
this video is going to be over how to

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.550 
this video is going to be over how to
read<00:00:02.909> and<00:00:03.149> write<00:00:03.179> decimals<00:00:06.410> alright<00:00:07.410> well

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
read and write decimals alright well

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.720 
read and write decimals alright well
let's<00:00:07.680> review<00:00:07.919> decimal<00:00:08.790> place<00:00:09.030> value<00:00:09.510> first

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:13.730 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.140 

remember<00:00:14.730> all<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:16.289> numbers<00:00:16.680> on<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.220> left<00:00:17.880> of

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
remember all the numbers on the left of

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.689 
remember all the numbers on the left of
the<00:00:18.240> decimal<00:00:18.420> are<00:00:18.869> whole<00:00:19.109> numbers<00:00:19.140> so<00:00:19.800> then

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
the decimal are whole numbers so then

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.420 
the decimal are whole numbers so then
you<00:00:20.850> have<00:00:21.060> tenths<00:00:22.220> hundredths<00:00:23.420> thousandths

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
you have tenths hundredths thousandths

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.160 
you have tenths hundredths thousandths
ten-thousandths<00:00:27.170> hundred-thousandths

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
ten-thousandths hundred-thousandths

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.470 
ten-thousandths hundred-thousandths
millionths<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.369> ten<00:00:29.789> millionths

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
millionths and ten millionths

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.410 
millionths and ten millionths
now<00:00:30.869> usually<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.679> place<00:00:31.980> value<00:00:32.219> usually<00:00:33.059> stops

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
now usually a place value usually stops

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.220 
now usually a place value usually stops
at<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:34.350> ten<00:00:34.590> thousandths<00:00:35.280> mark<00:00:35.579> as<00:00:36.230> usually

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
at the ten thousandths mark as usually

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.020 
at the ten thousandths mark as usually
as<00:00:37.440> far<00:00:37.739> as<00:00:38.270> we<00:00:39.270> would<00:00:39.450> usually<00:00:39.719> go<00:00:40.260> so<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.579> mean

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
as far as we would usually go so I mean

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.520 
as far as we would usually go so I mean
you<00:00:42.149> can<00:00:42.300> memorize<00:00:42.480> those<00:00:42.960> but<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.230> release

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
you can memorize those but I release

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.979 
you can memorize those but I release
memorize<00:00:44.070> up<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.730> ten<00:00:44.969> thousandths<00:00:47.989> now

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
memorize up to the ten thousandths now

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.439 
memorize up to the ten thousandths now
when<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.320> read<00:00:49.530> decimals<00:00:50.160> let's<00:00:50.399> read<00:00:51.059> the

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
when you read decimals let's read the

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:59.060 
when you read decimals let's read the
first<00:00:51.690> one<00:00:55.100> this<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.340> forty<00:00:56.879> three<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:58.070> six

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
first one this is forty three and six

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.440 
first one this is forty three and six
tenths<00:01:00.230> five<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:02.000> two<00:01:03.000> tenths<00:01:03.890> seven<00:01:04.890> and

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
thousandths in 5 and 25 hundredths now

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.450 
thousandths in 5 and 25 hundredths now
to<00:01:20.330> when<00:01:21.330> you've<00:01:21.509> read<00:01:21.810> decimals<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:23.070> have<00:01:23.100> to

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
to when you've read decimals you have to

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.450 
to when you've read decimals you have to
remember<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.900> decimal<00:01:25.830> point<00:01:26.189> is

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
remember that the decimal point is

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.600 
remember that the decimal point is
always<00:01:26.909> an<00:01:27.240> end<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.960> every<00:01:28.740> one<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:28.950> these<00:01:29.250> the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
always an end and every one of these the

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.050 
always an end and every one of these the
decimal<00:01:30.509> points<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.189> in<00:01:33.110> decimal<00:01:34.110> point

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
decimal points is in decimal point

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.749 
decimal points is in decimal point
decimal<00:01:36.060> point<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.340> decimal<00:01:38.340> point<00:01:38.579> is

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
decimal point is and decimal point is

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.080 
decimal point is and decimal point is
and<00:01:39.210> always<00:01:39.869> say<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.280> then<00:01:41.729> when<00:01:41.939> you're

reading all the numbers on the right of
the<00:01:45.869> decimal<00:01:46.020> they<00:01:46.829> end<00:01:47.070> in<00:01:47.280> thousands<00:01:48.060> 5<00:01:48.750> into

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
the decimal they end in thousands 5 into

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.490 
the decimal they end in thousands 5 into
10<00:01:49.979> are<00:01:50.189> not<00:01:50.490> thousands<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.210> th<00:01:51.570> five<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.350> two

thousand seven and 2943 and six tenths
they<00:02:02.880> all<00:02:03.060> end<00:02:03.390> in<00:02:03.630> th<00:02:07.429> alright<00:02:08.429> so<00:02:08.580> let's<00:02:08.759> read

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
they all end in th alright so let's read

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.800 
they all end in th alright so let's read
this<00:02:09.209> this<00:02:09.810> is<00:02:10.050> six<00:02:10.890> three<00:02:11.129> two<00:02:11.459> point<00:02:11.879> one<00:02:12.239> how

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
this this is six three two point one how

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.030 
this this is six three two point one how
would

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
would

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.229 
would
we<00:02:13.129> say<00:02:13.400> that<00:02:13.640> we<00:02:14.450> would<00:02:15.049> say<00:02:15.230> that<00:02:15.849> 632<00:02:16.849> and

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
we say that we would say that 632 and

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:26.349 
we say that we would say that 632 and
one<00:02:18.909> 632<00:02:19.909> and<00:02:20.120> 1/10<00:02:20.629> or<00:02:22.719> 623<00:02:23.719> and<00:02:23.930> 1/10<00:02:24.409> or<00:02:25.359> 632

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:26.359 
one 632 and 1/10 or 623 and 1/10 or 632

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:30.610 
one 632 and 1/10 or 623 and 1/10 or 632
and<00:02:26.569> 100th<00:02:27.230> or<00:02:27.859> we<00:02:28.159> know<00:02:28.370> that<00:02:28.700> it's<00:02:28.870> 632<00:02:29.870> and

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
and 100th or we know that it's 632 and

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.280 
and 100th or we know that it's 632 and
we<00:02:30.709> know<00:02:30.829> that<00:02:30.980> this<00:02:31.129> is<00:02:31.310> 1/10<00:02:31.970> so<00:02:32.810> we<00:02:32.930> need<00:02:33.109> to

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
we know that this is 1/10 so we need to

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.500 
we know that this is 1/10 so we need to
find<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.739> one<00:02:33.890> that<00:02:33.920> says<00:02:35.140> 632<00:02:36.140> and<00:02:36.530> 1/10<00:02:37.510> so

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
find the one that says 632 and 1/10 so

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:48.670 
find the one that says 632 and 1/10 so
that<00:02:38.689> would<00:02:38.840> be<00:02:39.970> this<00:02:40.970> one<00:02:46.420> 7<00:02:47.420> over<00:02:47.750> 100<00:02:48.200> where

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
that would be this one 7 over 100 where

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.259 
that would be this one 7 over 100 where
we<00:02:48.799> know<00:02:48.950> it's<00:02:49.129> 7<00:02:49.579> and<00:02:49.819> we<00:02:50.000> know<00:02:50.120> it's

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
we know it's 7 and we know it's

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.449 
we know it's 7 and we know it's
hundredths<00:02:50.930> so<00:02:51.620> we<00:02:51.680> needed<00:02:51.859> to<00:02:51.950> find<00:02:52.129> the<00:02:52.280> one

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
hundredths so we needed to find the one

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:58.050 
hundredths so we needed to find the one
that<00:02:52.609> says<00:02:52.760> 7<00:02:53.180> hundredths<00:02:53.780> that's<00:02:54.590> right<00:02:54.980> here

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.720 

let's<00:02:59.060> try<00:02:59.269> this

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
let's try this

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.659 
let's try this
123<00:03:01.730> 10<00:03:02.329> thousandths<00:03:03.019> so<00:03:03.260> we<00:03:04.220> know<00:03:04.400> that<00:03:04.579> it

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:04.669 
123 10 thousandths so we know that it

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:07.149 
123 10 thousandths so we know that it
has<00:03:04.819> to<00:03:05.000> have<00:03:05.150> 10<00:03:05.419> thousands<00:03:05.989> at<00:03:06.139> the<00:03:06.260> end<00:03:06.439> so

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:07.159 
has to have 10 thousands at the end so

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:09.490 
has to have 10 thousands at the end so
this<00:03:07.370> one<00:03:07.549> has<00:03:07.730> 10<00:03:07.970> thousandths<00:03:08.720> and<00:03:08.930> this<00:03:09.290> one

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
this one has 10 thousandths and this one

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.050 
this one has 10 thousandths and this one
has<00:03:09.790> 10,000<00:03:10.790> so<00:03:10.970> we're<00:03:11.090> looking<00:03:11.389> for<00:03:12.010> 123<00:03:13.060> well

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
has 10,000 so we're looking for 123 well

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.629 
has 10,000 so we're looking for 123 well
it<00:03:14.329> looks<00:03:14.540> like<00:03:14.720> this<00:03:14.959> one<00:03:15.169> is<00:03:15.370> 123<00:03:16.370> 10

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:16.639 
it looks like this one is 123 10

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:17.409 
it looks like this one is 123 10
thousandths

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:17.419

the<00:03:17.900> next<00:03:18.169> one<00:03:18.349> says<00:03:18.379> 5<00:03:18.859> &amp;<00:03:19.310> 3<00:03:19.389> well<00:03:20.389> we<00:03:20.569> have

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859 
the next one says 5 &amp; 3 well we have

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:23.969 
the next one says 5 &amp; 3 well we have
tenths<00:03:21.859> hundredths<00:03:22.790> thousandths

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:23.979

tenths hundredths thousandths
ten-thousandths<00:03:24.979> hundred-thousandths<00:03:25.940> so

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
ten-thousandths hundred-thousandths so

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.789 
ten-thousandths hundred-thousandths so
we<00:03:26.359> need<00:03:26.479> the<00:03:26.599> one<00:03:26.750> that<00:03:26.930> looks<00:03:27.109> like<00:03:27.229> hundred

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
we need the one that looks like hundred

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.369 
we need the one that looks like hundred
thousandths<00:03:28.549> or<00:03:29.299> if<00:03:29.449> we're<00:03:29.599> looking<00:03:29.750> here<00:03:30.199> we

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:32.800 
thousandths or if we're looking here we
only<00:03:30.590> see<00:03:30.919> one<00:03:31.250> with<00:03:31.549> hundred<00:03:31.940> thousandths<00:03:32.629> so

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
only see one with hundred thousandths so

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.780 
only see one with hundred thousandths so
it<00:03:33.019> must<00:03:33.199> be<00:03:33.379> this<00:03:33.560> one<00:03:33.799> five<00:03:34.159> and<00:03:34.459> three

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
it must be this one five and three

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.629 
it must be this one five and three
hundred<00:03:35.030> thousandths<00:03:38.199> all<00:03:39.199> right<00:03:39.379> now<00:03:39.620> now<00:03:40.519> if

hundred thousandths all right now now if

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:46.300 
hundred thousandths all right now now if
we<00:03:40.760> wanted<00:03:40.970> to<00:03:41.030> write<00:03:41.620> 13,000<00:03:44.590> well<00:03:45.590> we<00:03:46.099> know

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
we wanted to write 13,000 well we know

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.520 
we wanted to write 13,000 well we know
that<00:03:47.889> it's<00:03:48.889> tenths<00:03:49.639> hundredths<00:03:50.629> thousandths

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
that it's tenths hundredths thousandths

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.219 
that it's tenths hundredths thousandths
the<00:03:51.919> 13<00:03:52.430> has<00:03:52.669> to<00:03:52.849> be<00:03:53.000> in<00:03:53.150> the<00:03:53.269> foul<00:03:53.479> end<00:03:53.750> in<00:03:54.079> the

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:54.229 
the 13 has to be in the foul end in the

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:57.069 
the 13 has to be in the foul end in the
thousandths<00:03:54.829> place<00:03:54.970> value<00:03:55.970> so<00:03:56.689> we<00:03:56.780> need<00:03:56.930> to

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
thousandths place value so we need to

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:00.520 
thousandths place value so we need to
put<00:03:57.229> a<00:03:57.260> 0<00:03:57.769> there<00:03:57.799> as<00:03:58.519> a<00:03:58.579> placeholder<00:03:59.530> remember

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
put a 0 there as a placeholder remember

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.039 
put a 0 there as a placeholder remember
if<00:04:00.769> it<00:04:01.159> says<00:04:01.370> thousands<00:04:02.060> the<00:04:02.209> last<00:04:02.449> number<00:04:02.870> has

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
if it says thousands the last number has

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.589 
if it says thousands the last number has
to<00:04:03.229> end<00:04:03.379> on<00:04:03.680> that<00:04:04.010> place<00:04:04.310> value<00:04:05.019> 20<00:04:06.019> and<00:04:06.290> 600

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 
to end on that place value 20 and 600

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.059 
to end on that place value 20 and 600
600<00:04:08.599> Snead's<00:04:08.959> to<00:04:09.139> end<00:04:09.319> in<00:04:09.530> the<00:04:09.650> hundredths

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
600 Snead's to end in the hundredths

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:14.050 
600 Snead's to end in the hundredths
place<00:04:10.099> value<00:04:10.540> so<00:04:11.540> we<00:04:11.750> have<00:04:11.900> 20<00:04:12.590> and<00:04:13.060> because

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
place value so we have 20 and because

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.930 
place value so we have 20 and because
it's<00:04:14.269> 20<00:04:14.780> and<00:04:15.019> so<00:04:15.530> it's<00:04:15.680> 20<00:04:16.400> and<00:04:16.579> a<00:04:16.639> decimal

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
it's 20 and so it's 20 and a decimal

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.439 
it's 20 and so it's 20 and a decimal
point<00:04:17.060> six<00:04:18.049> hundredths<00:04:18.709> 10<00:04:19.159> hundredths<00:04:20.060> so<00:04:20.359> it

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:20.449 
point six hundredths 10 hundredths so it

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:22.750 
point six hundredths 10 hundredths so it
has<00:04:20.539> to<00:04:20.659> be<00:04:20.750> six<00:04:21.079> here<00:04:21.409> with<00:04:22.039> a<00:04:22.070> zero<00:04:22.550> as<00:04:22.729> a
