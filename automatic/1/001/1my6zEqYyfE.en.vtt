00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.230
 [music] 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.820
 you are looking at pets 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.130
 Today we will talk about educating our 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.990
 pet dogs guest studio 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.090
 dog trainer Alexei Potekhin 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.230
 Alexey good evening good thank you for 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.939
 participation in our broadcast 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.680
 Well, today we will probably consider everything 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.630
 age categories several breeds 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.750
 dogs how to raise them 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.329
 achieve the desired effect due to which 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.180
 impossible questions a lot but let's obo 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.010
 all in order to bring up 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.600
 the dog we want to see 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.940
 his apartment next to him on 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.520
 throughout the long life it is necessary 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.120
 begin small age and here 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.309
 probably correct speech story about 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.379
 choosing a puppy 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.940
 here at the age of 3 months until when we 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.370
 traditionally acquired 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.050
 dogs are there certain traits 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.109
 character peculiar to this or that 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.940
 flog and can we observe them 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:06.580
 First we buy traditionally in 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:10.470
 a half in two and a half months so here 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:13.930
 secondly, probably the first is a breed they 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.079
 puppy selection in a particular memory that is 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:20.829
 need to be determined with the size of that 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:22.390
 obviously from the activity level of the dog well 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:23.950
 come on right maybe a few 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.100
 breeds are listed if we are talking about 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.479
 young and energetic active family 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.310
 whatever breeds you advise here 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.310
 who can walk 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:37.299
 can hold a big dog up 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.789
 deal with her men but any active 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:43.060
 the breed there is for example the same 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:45.490
 labrador shepherd doberman let's say it 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.770
 already for a very active dare family can 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.689
 be young and active but they 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.000
 more engaged in fitness room 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:55.060
 and walk with the dog they have no time and 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.049
 Therefore , for example, Biederman is not suitable 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.420
 and if we say this is a family with children 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:04.440
 itâ€™s better to stay small too 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.149
 labrador than let's take a rottweiler 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.280
 That's about as well and if we are talking about 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.810
 older people who want 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.099
 who are left maybe alone want 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.590
 find a friend but already that energy is not for 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.480
 so that may be so often i 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.640
 actively walk in the fresh air and 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.040
 engage your pet then they 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.330
 can take a poodle and you are beautiful there 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.830
 here by nature to fit well yes 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.620
 of course not to take and just a cur 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:37.739
 some kind of abandoned if this young 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:40.150
 Doggy normal such dogs very 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:43.200
 a great feeling of gratitude to their 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.000
 the owners and repay kindness attention 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.410
 I doubt they feel 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.340
 thanks they can be perfect 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.250
 different 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.530
 but just when let's say 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.810
 podroschennye pooch on her for something 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.519
 there you can see about gratitude 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.340
 somehow with big doubts 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.540
 the usual was going on well alexey well 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.580
 let 's order you 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.920
 one and a half to two months 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.680
 we choose a puppy before but most importantly 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.380
 that he was not shy because it 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:15.100
 check here you went to the room where 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:17.950
 puppies sit puppies that are there for themselves 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.570
 they do not play for themselves and they donâ€™t need a person 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.850
 puppies that go chat 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.860
 Meet and puppies that will start 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.810
 hide but they will somehow pages 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.230
 maybe get under the chair under the chair 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.180
 somehow in the store mano while 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.830
 let's say so breeder seller he can 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.280
 talk about what is he now 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:38.440
 small or but this dog guard 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.260
 she just doesn't trust with time 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.170
 she will become stronger self confident 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.110
 and then this and distrust will go to 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.180
 advantage but it is in general not the case 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.080
 that's because usually but this is not 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.500
 delusion 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.810
 1 directed deception yes that is, whatever 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.120
 the dog was not walking and the dog was there 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.610
 companion walks and conductor blind though 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.380
 it is a guard she must first 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.959
 feel confidently calm 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.730
 adequate and comfortable in this world only 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:11.620
 in this case she can work she 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:15.220
 can be trained differently does well if 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:18.820
 the dog has no problem let's say so 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:21.130
 fear and then it can take nothing special 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.110
 on gusov what he was advised to take that 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.960
 which is here in this group so bring it closer 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.730
 on puppies identified those who are fearful 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.840
 somewhere hide those who play them 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.510
 pay no attention to us 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.460
 who go to meet us 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.280
 here 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:39.250
 of the remaining two groups most 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:42.520
 contact we take well not necessarily well 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.919
 this thing is that in order for them to 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.050
 actually choose need to go there not 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:49.630
 once and sit very long because 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.060
 today is the one who is the contact tomorrow he 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.830
 will play purely here on the situation 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:58.259
 carried away his not paying attention to 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:05:00.729
 entered person but again a fat choice 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:02.470
 but it is not the impulsive chosen again 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:03.669
 same puppy he can fit a man by 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.180
 different it can fit 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:09.220
 but quite obsequiously so to speak 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.620
 compressing the tail ducking 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.599
 turning over on his back and can 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:17.680
 approach fun vigorously active 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:21.009
 let's say assertively go more like that and or 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.380
 play fight it depends on 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:26.440
 man if he wants to not be 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:29.020
 trembling tender dog well, then better 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.849
 take such an ointment or passivity film 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.430
 from jealousy for good lexin here 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:36.479
 we chose puppy offered home how 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.479
 first teams
