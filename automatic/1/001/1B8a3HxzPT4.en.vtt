00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 hello my pretty beautiful girls 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.220
 expressions of the whole world how are 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.170
 at this moment I found myself vacation 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.820
 but I never forgot them and he is in a 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.679
 super interesting video because you 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.660
 I have been asked about half a kilo in 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.059
 legs for that time that we did not have 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.980
 in little pieces in a skirt if we are going to put together 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.170
 of the pool can you know that 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.789
 we want to be super well presented in 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.080
 the legs I always told them that 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.990
 the personal presentation of a woman 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.430
 count very many is very important already 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.109
 I have always liked how to have 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.660
 clean legs like since I go to 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.130
 school and with the gardener you will see 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.469
 with the skirt would be the legs 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.770
 then he constantly rolled from pilato 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.570
 and then in this time as the 2 12 13 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.700
 years I started to use different 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.320
 hair removal methods today is going on a 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.940
 while two of my favorite methods are 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.980
 very easy techniques that we can 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.140
 do at home without having to be 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.969
 experts in the subject the first method the 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.860
 He told them he did it in wax blankets 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.809
 cold these are life have for 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.480
 different skin types let's say this 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.309
 which is green is for dry skin like 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.140
 can see there and they contain aloe vera 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.210
 to help moisturize the skin while 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.180
 we shave the roses are for skin 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.220
 normal and contain shea butter 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.350
 and also red fruit extract the 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.670
 blue contain vitamin of oil 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.320
 almonds and these are for the skins 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.180
 sensitive and the pelas that are usually 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.310
 irritate a lot with all the creams 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.260
 the shavers then these are more 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.390
 delicate and in the middle we do not have the 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.070
 suppress that is that they are not for any 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.920
 specific skin type but they are a 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.479
 little more luxurious reality these 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.760
 They can use any type of skin 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.410
 now every box you're good 8 bands of 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.360
 operatives that you can use them in 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.220
 the legs in the bikini lines and 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.750
 also in the armpits but I recommend you 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.490
 that you do not use in the face since this 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.200
 is given is very strong and you can tear yourself 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.390
 the top layer of the skin and it has already 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.070
 gone and it's horrible then those 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.990
 bandits are not for the face to 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.820
 using them is really very easy and it is 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.440
 a good hair removal method if you 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.930
 like to spend many days with legs 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.820
 super-licit because the wax covers the 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.950
 hair from the country that is from the 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.899
 follicle is taking out the chick then 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.000
 this is going to help delay 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.130
 much more time growing and legs 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.899
 are clean much longer they 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.820
 I'm going to be honest it hurts a little because 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.530
 obviously we are pulling hair from 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.420
 the root for the time you get used to 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.280
 the wax already doubled so much when you do 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.060
 the bandits also the hair root is 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.739
 it's weakening 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.200
 then the hair has grown a lot 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.060
 less and it becomes thinner when 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.680
 we could use the first step is 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.230
 make sure that the skin is super 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.030
 dry because moisture is focused on the skin 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.650
 the heras has adhered your skin and 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.930
 when you lift the band quite current 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.220
 it will be necessary to make a disaster 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.170
 then I just like to use a little 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.610
 baby powder or foot powder 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.530
 that will help us make the 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.690
 surface that is super dry and we can 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.160
 speak very well the hairs to me 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.690
 love these blessed geographic 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.550
 because you do not need any instrument 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.620
 additional to heat it but only 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.750
 I put the bandit in the middle of my two 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.730
 soon the next 10 or 15 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.890
 minutes until the wax becomes a 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.870
 slightly more liquid then open the little ball 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.090
 to expose the wax and I put it on 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.460
 the leg rubbing it in the direction 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.590
 the foot 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.510
 I recommend that the experts look very 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.190
 long nor very short good once 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.600
 unexpected your blessed do not think about it 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.790
 so much if you do not try to do this very 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.710
 fast you are going to put a hand sowing the 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.330
 skin on top of the band and 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.010
 then with the other hand you will take the 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.660
 band at the bottom and with a 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.980
 dry movement you're going to talk to 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.530
 above 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.000
 and it's that easy to depilate an area 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.739
 of the leg this flag can follow 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.659
 using until you feel that she 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.610
 It does not stick very well on your skin for a 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:22.440
 leg already used approximately three or 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.510
 four damn and good when there's already 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.459
 finished stacking my whole leg with a 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.379
 of these moisturizing little balls they want 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.030
 with the peace kit and also this is going to 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.620
 remove excess wax that has 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.420
 stayed on the skin as they put on 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.769
 lap is super easy it's not dirty 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.959
 because you do not have to take the sidewalk 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.819
 adult, then I'll ask you the questions 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.709
 they form you have to rub them 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.120
 you remove them and that's all but 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.680
 Well, I have to tell you that those are 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.930
 the length of the middle of the leg towards 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.459
 down because there like he endured a lot 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.200
 more the pain but the top part does not 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.209
 I know why it always hurts me a lot to mediate 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.709
 as a video then in the part of 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.750
 above I use a depilatory cream 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.700
 this cream that I have here the pencil 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.290
 natural is the papaya extract the 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.120
 Use of creams is the simplest 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.340
 what there is but you have to have 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.840
 precautions before using it always 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.730
 and it's always very important that 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.799
 you do a reaction test this fat 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.569
 spicy a small amount on a 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.879
 bit of your leg you're going to act 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.560
 three minutes and then you just fold if 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:15.660
 your skin is normal is not 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.220
 and if you can apply the cream on the 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.260
 rest of the wait what happens is that no 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.090
 all bodies are equal then 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.070
 can you allergic reactions mind and 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.690
 it is better to prevent it by doing a test 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.550
 well once we know that our skin 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.230
 is apt to use this cremita and is 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.910
 very simple the only thing you have to 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.800
 do is apply a good amount 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.600
 on your skin and with the spatula that 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.520
 vélez in the kit you will spread very 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.280
 well the cream on the skin until creating 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.780
 a layer of waits up to 6 minutes not 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.090
 you can take that time because if not 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.770
 you can burn your skin and then you go to 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.020
 the shower and the eyes with a little 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.790
 water like to soften the cream and 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.770
 you start to remove it with the same 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.479
 spatula you get to see how all the 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.130
 little fingers are coming out this technique of 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:55.050
 hair removal I love it because it does not hurt 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.700
 for nothing and neither have the skin 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.770
 dry or there is danger of you cutting 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.510
 as a marker would finally 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.160
 finished with a good bath to get rid of me 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.330
 all the residue of that cream and I 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.400
 applied a little moisturizer 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.200
 over to keep the legs super 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.510
 hydrated smooth and pretty and they look 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.380
 bright and good girls I think that 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.900
 It's all I hope you liked it 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.610
 very much to know how he threw my legs 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.500
 They are very easy methods

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.469
