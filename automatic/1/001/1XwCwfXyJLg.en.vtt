00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:14.979
 the painter Dieter Zetsche "a heart for animals" through and charged 

00:00:14.979 --> 00:00:17.349
 Today, there is a lot of activity 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:19.300
 numerous women and men 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.160
 Evening already on 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.289
 Early morning the beat the best drove their trains 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.019
 it is sultry roles and students of the Institute of Mrs. Feldmann in Bayreuth 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.360
 as part of her education to the censored animal teacher and her teacher 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.239
 Today they are supposed to learn how to work with unknown dogs 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.280
 We especially the institute manager good and Feldmann why she figured out 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.350
 selected the HaÃŸfurter shelter 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.479
 because this is 

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:50.330
 28 8 years 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.200
 I am impressed 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.480
 2gb sealant 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.700
 it is with how little means 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.730
 write here 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.090
 in the Isar 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.470
 for fiction 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.180
 in the morning it is 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.330
 So now it is very strong and that is why I pulled myself 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.850
 very connected 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.320
 There is a strong point that this probably the animal that weighs too much 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.370
 becomes 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.710
 the chamber no caged keel 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.530
 a big drink is just right 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.920
 social personal that is our job is the one story 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.730
 which is different 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.749
 that's also what it's looking for 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.920
 I felt and I say so 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.440
 it is nice to read together with the people and he speaks only 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.480
 the St 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.650
 szo 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.650
 important is 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.649
 the Institut Feldmann is engaged in the research of understanding 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.820
 from the diversity through the research I offer the 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.120
 Search which field man with 2 0 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.710
 Institute director Ingrid Veltmann explains in the interview a bit 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.590
 negative it is the friend it is 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.940
 and what the basics of training not to the CS your child her empty 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:15.939
 we humans must learn to see the behavior of the animal 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:18.059
 Recognize nobility 

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:20.319
 and watching is not the essential 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.189
 see his dissertation tests 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:27.860
 that 's what it' s all about and I think we 're right there with our pets 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:28.829
 generously 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:29.700
 that haggling 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.379
 interpretation 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.269
 that is in the right place 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.860
 the right spice counted the behavior of the animals 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.339
 that used to be 

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:39.909
 what the animals have with each other at home 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:43.349
 To confess Brasseur and then have to do that well 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:44.519
 Courses 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.879
 Frankfurt / M 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:49.379
 if it goes she threatened over the end 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:52.470
 to make the gate what man is the virus Bushels 

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:57.489
 We must now first of all the behavior of the animal that is at the expense 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:58.409
 of learning 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:01.789
 Of course, for us it can be easier 

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:05.689
 the more they are here too 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:07.599
 clearly all 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.459
 really bad 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.909
 they form Tir teachers us 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.790
 is this term so correct and 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.790
 what does she test it out what does one learn 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:24.239
 I will expose you teachers and their teachers and what I mean by that 

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:29.349
 she does not explain that because I'm using our athletes now 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:31.269
 next to several people 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:32.649
 in the tests 

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:35.639
 then they test us 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:36.840
 observed that 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.840
 animal and interpreted is really easier than now 

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:43.669
 This will help people to meet the animal 

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:48.629
 here were empty 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.629
 to prepare a good example 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:55.169
 thanks to understanding and easing 

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:56.480
 her own presence 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.439
 no plan kicking 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:01.439
 How long does the training take the expulsion 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.029
 between two and four years 

00:04:04.029 --> 00:04:05.509
 that always depends 

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:07.489
 how many 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:08.659
 You explain 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:11.589
 have the opportunity with you 

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:12.979
 deal 

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:15.219
 with only one's own is not enough 

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:19.959
 we simply have to get to know many different physicians and personalities 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.819
 so we also in ten different signals 

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:25.580
 besides more or less clear 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.509
 it will be or 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:30.509
 Learned behavior Signals are often 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:34.809
 and then drive from the Bund if used to 

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:37.840
 when people are looking for Havana, so to speak 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.040
 These are all things that the animals learn and they can not just do that 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.110
 one or two but paragraph numbers 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.680
 many want 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.409
 there it is again the beautiful that the shelter in HaÃŸfurt 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:51.439
 Softies are interested in it 

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:53.439
 that is fair to the animals 

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:54.650
 highlight 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:55.719
 drives again 

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:58.169
 when the outside 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.330
 they do not see each other 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.650
 They also keep the clinic 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.249
 the fear takes her personally 

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:09.929
 this is how the institute makes an important contribution 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.650
 that we humans better understand the behavior of our beloved four-legged friends 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.979
 and subsequently less poor battered round cats and others 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:23.169
 Land pets in our shelter 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:27.719
 there is a lot of comfort, many of us have a better life 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:29.689
 as with her team until 17
