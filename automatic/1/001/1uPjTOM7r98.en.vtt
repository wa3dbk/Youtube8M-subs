00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.620
 Ok people here to help 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.420
 technique doing in another video 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.330
 tutorial for someone with a bit of 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:18.330
 difficulty in getting back the s 925 of the 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:21.109
 america.no sks well at first you go 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.900
 need to have a car like this 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:34.200
 this is a known rs232 cable 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:36.030
 as cable at the right time first step is 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.579
 so you need to have a car of this and 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.210
 need to have the computer port on your 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:45.600
 serial and if you do not have an agreement, 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.059
 then you have recourse and I have 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.129
 that the serial port that the rs232 cable has 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.530
 two doors and we will do for these 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.730
 doors here we then go to space the 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.120
 first you will download the files 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.660
 needed two files back to sks 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.879
 again it is I downloaded by the portal friend 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.430
 of debts in which partners or better 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.260
 telling partners of the decos you will 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.450
 open file down here when you 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.360
 open he's going to have two here or in there 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.900
 called step one step 2 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:21.810
 first you will open champion 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:24.960
 click on this pdx land 2.0 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.890
 this page puts the door on you 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.220
 use in case I'll use the door one goes 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.909
 yesterday open the file here you put the 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.610
 milk is 2.0 which is this the first 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.009
 file correctly follow space that does not 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.799
 you have a mistake, this is not how you click here 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.899
 Let's now prepare the appliance. 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:48.990
 to receive this file we give 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.149
 hail to the start and then start doing 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.420
 it recovers with this file after having 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.649
 placed the cars here on gate 1 of the 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.670
 computer 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:04.860
 to the receiver's serial port. 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:08.910
 r 925 from asia america rock without putting the 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.380
 eliminator cable or power supply 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.810
 right 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.770
 So you go the computer now and give 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.020
 the starte program ready the book has 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.140
 still carrying haiti is waiting 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:26.520
 then you do the activation you go 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.230
 Here places the cable in the laying unit 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.100
 the car on the device planned to start 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:39.030
 then the first resort of the process 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:44.250
 here it will still appear is success is 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:46.760
 waiting here ready it appeared success 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.760
 you give ok 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.890
 what to give causing more confusion 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.750
 in this area here is that some people 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.390
 already doing directly here is 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:01.220
 so you can not 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.220
 first you do the first recovery 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.380
 done its part of the recovery then we 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.860
 we came here with receiver we fit 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.690
 all cables did not fit the cable 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.900
 video was a lot of people put on hdmi 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:23.050
 more to do the test you did with Mr. 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:26.350
 and then I made it a tournament two everything 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.810
 connected here only the cable that is missing 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:34.480
 turn on the power in the industry 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:38.620
 come on then ready you are already connected to 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.180
 energy is not all in the band there is a certain 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.500
 as soon as it appears 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.500
 the channel you're going to mess up 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:52.660
 automatically no signal ready 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:55.690
 here is the author of two touches 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.970
 Then it will show up, let's go. 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.930
 wait and wait to get ready 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:06.130
 that already has a channel and even the channel with a 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:07.750
 smile is already with him and the others 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.390
 will appear ready appeared more 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.450
 another, and so on until it appears 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.680
 all water channels can expect 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.930
 so what are you waiting for? 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.880
 when it appeared on all channels 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.799
 let's go to a video procedure and do 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.830
 the second resort 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:26.560
 only after appearing every day there in the 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:30.280
 device as it was said was commented there 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.540
 so you come here again now as 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:36.720
 2 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:39.820
 likewise I did not believe in the file 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:48.310
 in the door that you will use in my case to 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:50.520
 a file opens the file 2.1 give a 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.520
 OK 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:57.020
 The car is already here ready but not 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.939
 connected again explaining the car 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:03.199
 but not connected 

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:06.169
 the ok starte program it will get 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:08.810
 wait for you to connect the cable and 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:10.969
 Do you connect the car again? 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.900
 so will you be doing the second 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:13.939
 record 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.039
 then come all this I do with much 

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:18.319
 careful do not wait do not do both 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:21.169
 like them without putting a receiver 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:22.759
 antenna and wait for your zio not to 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:24.469
 will give otherwise will work has already been 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:26.629
 tested and most staff are not 

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:28.759
 working for this reason do not make the 

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:31.759
 the correct way that the 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:37.039
 device again, right after the 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:40.400
 last resort and made the second and Kone 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:41.180
 which again can leave now can 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.539
 close 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:51.699
 remove your car again from the 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:51.699
 Let's take a look at this. 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:02.530
 It's definitely going to work again. 

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:33.189
 ah 

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.440
 O 

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:15.140
 here are the channels what he looks at 

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.140
 ready 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:28.290
 some still downloading the password but already the 

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:35.490
 opening opa receiver 2010 channel sportv 

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:37.830
 hd to itaqui the receiver working there 

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:41.220
 guys going back to something I forgot 

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:44.970
 to notify personnel and also the device 

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:47.910
 is working as sks and here in 

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:49.380
 If I heard the CarrÃ© know luiz roberto 

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:51.630
 the tongue with these waters 

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:53.520
 I'm using it, it 's Portuguese, it's expensive. 

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:55.410
 was paid or will not 

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.340
 Look at the little antenna. 

00:07:55.410 --> 00:08:00.319
 was 100 

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:04.819
 will not I will fall the river will fall slower 

00:08:00.319 --> 00:08:11.090
 than sks looks maintain software is 

00:08:04.819 --> 00:08:13.699
 other antenna cable just like michael 

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:20.860
 working perfect defends more trash 

00:08:13.699 --> 00:08:20.860
 than with the sk s &amp; s 908 central
