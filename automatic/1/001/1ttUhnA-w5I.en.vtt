00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.789
 hi guys and compass and welcome another 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:09.090
 new bedetti as they saw it in the 

00:00:05.789 --> 00:00:11.880
 title swift gameplay and review of 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.470
 great cars 5 online of the new dlc of 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.900
 flight school 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:19.060
 then let's start with the video 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.250
 today and as you can see there I already have 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.480
 I swift this one that is right here does not 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.369
 shot obviously so that I did not 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.860
 explode and first of all I wanted them 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:29.470
 say this let's go first to 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.020
 lists travel let's go to here just 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.110
 here for you to see this plane this 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.780
 helicopter does not have a value of what 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.180
 is doing one million 500 thousand and one 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.579
 million 600 thousand and if you wonder what is 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.860
 the difference then practically that of 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.830
 one and a half million and that of one million 600 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.500
 it is only the color there are no weapons 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.990
 I do not train besides then it's just the 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.460
 only difference the color then this 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.810
 it's the only difference there is of all 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.640
 ways later I'm going to put a 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.710
 gameplay to see what it's going 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.710
 doing the other helicopter then 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.479
 let's try this is the swift line 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.729
 bravo the edition to say it as well as 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.229
 military type then let's try it 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.299
 so you can tell me how 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.810
 it seems like they see it's a helicopter 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:15.640
 common and current that has a square 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.590
 for four people then I think 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.090
 that is pretty good and as you will know 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.860
 here the helicopters are pretty 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.600
 easy to drive then 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.680
 the truth is not much change between this 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.210
 vehicle and another and another like tell them the 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.370
 helicopter the truth is the same 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.900
 driving and I really think it is 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.970
 something that is super good then like 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.770
 they see it is practically a helicopter 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.600
 ordinary and the only difference is 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.520
 that is pretty nice and has a 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.170
 place for four people but from there 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.550
 on the outside it is exactly the same 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.990
 so I think it's something that is 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.180
 pretty good that they have not been included 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.190
 new models because these resemble a 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.620
 little bit more to reality, not because 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.420
 As you can see it is practically a 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.490
 normal helicopter in fact look 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.530
 they want landed anywhere like 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.360
 they see it is a very easy helicopter 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.160
 land then just what 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.780
 landed here as they see it is very 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.140
 easy to control and can land it 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.670
 to your liking not as you know there are some 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.890
 some helicopters that can be a 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.720
 little bit of work landing as is the 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.220
 case of the charge but how can you see this 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.959
 It is very easy to control in two ways 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.090
 right now on the screen they will be 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.580
 watching a background gameplay of what's going 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.230
 doing the classic swift and how they see it 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.790
 the only thing that changes is practically the 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.709
 color the truth there is no kind of 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.870
 change and as you can appreciate it is 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.920
 only the color what changes and the 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.500
 truly believe that one 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.209
 bring arms so give him maybe like the 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.860
 another helicopter that right now does not 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.420
 I agree very well with the name but as 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.890
 remember there are twelve helicopters the 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.200
 which have weapons and I think it is 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.090
 something that looks pretty good, not them 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.620
 I really expected that and the truth was I stayed 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.510
 somewhat disappointed because the only thing 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.310
 change are the colors but the truth 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.620
 that is super well even if I do not have this 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.420
 not such as the aneel heitor that are 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.280
 helicopter that has bullets and all this 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.950
 and I thought I was going to do something for him 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.209
 style but the truth is not the labor 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.980
 the only ones that change are the colors 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.599
 So, I hope you guys liked it 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.580
