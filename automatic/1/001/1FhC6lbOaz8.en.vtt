00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:10.750
 where people from www.toyota.de and me 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:13.780
 So, at the moment, it seems to me that 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.400
 whole world crazy on the nexus 4 is and 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.140
 some of you probably also 1 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.999
 ordered or still on it 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.779
 wait until you can order 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:25.060
 and again some may also 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.909
 The search for a bag is after 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.829
 the case or maybe after im 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:32.140
 protective films or otherwise because of two 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:33.550
 I thought about what protects your smartphone 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.309
 I like, I present you again today 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.320
 very shortly before what I use so around 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:42.010
 to protect my next four now and 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.899
 Although I am not a friend of these 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.780
 funny hard cases because if i do that 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:48.309
 get out of the bag then I want so in 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.809
 have the hand as it is and 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.399
 not that the device by now 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.160
 unnecessarily gets bigger and above all 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:56.620
 Also, these cases usually cover TFR 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.050
 back and that of lexus like that must 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.929
 you do not necessarily hide 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.390
 At least I use foils 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:05.950
 not really for the 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.270
 Maybe I could get one back 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.680
 I could imagine that, though 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.630
 for the front finn is actually 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.230
 Needless to say, that's the only thing that's going to happen anyway 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.400
 picture costs money and the finger slides 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.590
 Also not so good on the display 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.360
 So the experience I have made so far 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.040
 At some point, reading is also underneath and 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.630
 Apart from that, I have never had one 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.880
 foil is used the display and me 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:29.320
 never had one 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:33.730
 Scratch drum says I personally use 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.440
 bags and quite simply firstly 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.550
 The bags usually clean that 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.010
 display is a bit of the 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.750
 Fingerprints from the smears 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.100
 second, the bag chips my cellphone 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.570
 if I trouser pocket it in 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.070
 it falls to me for example is from the 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.020
 pocket out then it does not pop on the 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.700
 bottom is in the bag and 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.190
 bang it on the floor and that 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.740
 Mutes already have clear for me now 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.910
 brings nothing if the foreign and falls 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.120
 then you probably have the bag 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.410
 anyway not so then listen up so 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.910
 on the floor but when it's outside tables 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.640
 In the second place you just have the bag 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.020
 but that's what matters most to me 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.350
 actually the function that that 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.500
 display is cleaned and me 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.300
 I'm a big fan of feedback myself 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.360
 I already have four bags 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.850
 ordered and that is just new 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.180
 arrived that in principle the same as 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.280
 in the previous of a galaxy s2 stop now 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.870
 a little bit bigger and they still one 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.920
 A little bit of freshness is always present 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.630
 more time with beck so they could 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.180
 Buy bags on Amazon or either 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.160
 in the own shop to the also and that 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.319
 special in the feedback is the bags 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.150
 are tailor made for devices that 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.280
 means the devices would be presumptuous and 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.750
 then as appropriate bag created 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.519
 if now clearly the data for 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.280
 Next game available then can you 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.060
 with the order also simply nexus 4g 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.630
 gets with bag in the matching 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.340
 size 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.410
 There are many different ones 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.800
 materials that can choose for 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.480
 your bags there are different colors 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.880
 this velvet lining has the 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.670
 actually all that cleans the display 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.650
 you could still lead for circling 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.489
 for radiation protection get the 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.440
 then reduce the radiation around yours 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.390
 rich parts to protect you can do one 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.239
 let snap hook on it and 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.190
 even a cellphone jewelry loop 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.130
 Some people had him like one 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:23.670
 trailer or something on the bag to me 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.480
 I have a very simple nappa leather 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.160
 took 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.329
 with this in feed on the 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.950
 I also have radiation protection 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.989
 I can not understand 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.700
 Imagine that the difference is mega 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.930
 in vain to hail those son and so I have 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.220
 not even politically has me now 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:40.739
 cost on Amazon including shipping 22 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.750
 euro and i can give you that short 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.859
 demonstrate 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.709
 maybe you can see it for a short time now 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:47.640
 the fingerprints on the display this 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.040
 available 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.410
 it is the bag the phone in here 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.840
 sucks ass at once 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.940
 one hundred percent that not so much 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.790
 air in that I'm not enough air inside 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:03.090
 that fits right up here too 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.310
 it was just wonderful you have the 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.140
 pocket in your trouser pocket for a while 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.000
 running through the area controls everything 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.010
 so a bit the display la la la 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.180
 then you get out of here and this one 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.280
 info not on the display 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.660
 that's not crystal clear after that though 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.019
 In any case, much better as 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.019
 before 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:25.229
 as I said so the cheapest bag 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.560
 by fig of feedback you get off 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:29.110
 13 euros 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.820
 and depending on what you have a lot of material 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.009
 wanted and you much frills to do so 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.630
 Well then it could already be as 20 25 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:36.250
 or 30 euros I will have it 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:40.240
 right here in the lower left in the 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:42.430
 description to amazon and to the shop 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.350
 and i really only can my bag 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.000
 recommend you have no problem 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.169
 no slides use space there comes 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.849
 not in your pocket because the 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:50.650
 bag is in it when it comes out of the 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:53.889
 pants pocket that she protected and hers 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.570
 still have the full well feeling 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:58.360
 if you pick up your device 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.710
 unfortunately no chronist or otherwise 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.919
 other sports and you always have one 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:05.349
 clean display so as said by 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:08.490
 Feedback is the good that was it 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:08.490
 again alias zschau
