00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
system for the first time we develop and

we patent a new leather material in

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.219 
we patent a new leather material in
carbon<00:01:11.040> fiber<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.460> we<00:01:12.060> call<00:01:12.360> carbon<00:01:12.750> skin

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
carbon fiber that we call carbon skin

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.399 
carbon fiber that we call carbon skin
and<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.130> really<00:01:14.400> upholstery<00:01:15.330> in<00:01:15.869> carbon

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
and is a really upholstery in carbon

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.109 
and is a really upholstery in carbon
fiber<00:01:16.680> this<00:01:17.159> allowed<00:01:17.430> us<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.640> have<00:01:17.909> an

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
fiber this allowed us to have an

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.120 
fiber this allowed us to have an
additional<00:01:18.840> weight<00:01:19.020> reduction<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.619> 25

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
additional weight reduction of 25

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.499 
additional weight reduction of 25
percent<00:01:20.340> compared<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.299> conventional

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
percent compared to the conventional

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.679 
percent compared to the conventional
material<00:01:22.470> an<00:01:22.710> additional<00:01:23.310> problem<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.509> was

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
material an additional problem that was

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.300 
material an additional problem that was
the<00:01:24.840> color<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.320> car<00:01:25.590> because<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.100> car

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
the color of the car because the car

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.760 
the color of the car because the car
must<00:01:26.729> be<00:01:26.820> really<00:01:27.180> shocked<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:28.259> not<00:01:28.470> only

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
must be really shocked that is not only

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.149 
must be really shocked that is not only
a<00:01:29.250> color<00:01:29.579> but<00:01:29.909> is<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.060> color<00:01:30.360> where<00:01:31.320> bi<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:32.040> we

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
a color but is a color where bi that we

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.340 
a color but is a color where bi that we

when<00:02:13.500> we<00:02:13.650> discuss<00:02:14.520> about<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.940> cow<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.180> discuss

when we discuss about the cow to discuss

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.890 
when we discuss about the cow to discuss
about<00:02:15.780> performance<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:16.620> what<00:02:17.490> I<00:02:17.520> said<00:02:17.670> is<00:02:18.030> can

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
about performance and what I said is can

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.380 
about performance and what I said is can
be<00:02:19.080> only<00:02:19.290> better<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:20.160> maximum<00:02:20.640> speed<00:02:20.850> must<00:02:21.180> be

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
be only better the maximum speed must be

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.820 
be only better the maximum speed must be
over<00:02:23.060> 350<00:02:24.060> kilometer<00:02:24.420> per<00:02:24.720> hour<00:02:25.050> and<00:02:25.530> the

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
over 350 kilometer per hour and the

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.330 
over 350 kilometer per hour and the
acceleration<00:02:26.370> 0-100<00:02:26.940> must<00:02:27.360> be<00:02:27.510> lower<00:02:28.230> of<00:02:28.590> 2.9

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
acceleration 0-100 must be lower of 2.9

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.550 
acceleration 0-100 must be lower of 2.9
second<00:02:29.910> that<00:02:30.090> is<00:02:30.210> what<00:02:30.360> we<00:02:30.510> declare<00:02:30.840> for<00:02:31.110> event

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
second that is what we declare for event

I<00:02:34.710> play<00:02:35.270> this<00:02:36.270> is<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:36.870> think<00:02:37.080> what<00:02:37.410> is

I play this is I think what is

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.440 
I play this is I think what is
Lamborghini<00:02:38.010> at<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.400> end<00:02:38.550> when<00:02:38.880> you<00:02:39.270> have<00:02:39.420> a
