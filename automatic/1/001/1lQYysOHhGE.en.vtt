00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:06.270
 and this video was powered by a 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.919
 ps flash player bought at rockets 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.440

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.590
 mouse pad on the link 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.590
 subscription 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.340
 And there's beauty that will command the 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.020
 party understood very welcome more 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.720
 A video galley will not let me go 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.560
 comment on a news that is pumping 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.599
 Ok, ok, yes, we are like that with 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.160
 when leaving anything and is so 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.040
 we have a noise in pedro 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.750
 internet goes crazy old 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.690
 This is cool, it's very cool to see the image. 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.640
 which will hold generating status and at the hearing 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.510
 It's apparently really cool, it's even 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.950
 novelty 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.770
 let's help opt even went 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.930
 proven by cash form has dose 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.789
 nobody faced it there and put the face 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.920
 as the guy proved this answer 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.570
 Rockstar's leaked was by way of 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.039
 cash then you click on the link open I 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.300
 I can not see, I can not 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.520
 Leave a link to the news to 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.530
 then give a read and also sell the 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.879
 car leaves public then published 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.879
 some things some differences that 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.369
 they will have and one of these things gives a 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.760
 answer the user the business so it is 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.100
 who will have the first person mode in the 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.869
 next gp in the next generation of gta 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.740
 never think it will split in two 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.020
 generations 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.509
 the current generation and in this generation 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.060
 new will come some changes between 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.430
 they are seeing the first person because 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.140
 is legal type occurs is my concerning 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.820
 People have to think about asking a little 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.159
 the first study confirms that I am 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.200
 I think they would not increase 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.090
 some game that was somehow 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.409
 To harm the game, this is the first 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.159
 point I wanted to talk about this 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.650
 news 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.659
 the second point is that there is already a hatred 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.000
 to play gta in your first game 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.530
 It's very bugged, it's very strange. 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.360
 name of them dave jones made a video 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.220
 I'll look for this and if I find 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.810
 This gpu video in the first person I go 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.320
 down a link this way also the link 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.060
 of the video also in the description so I 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.189
 I really like the main idea of accounts 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.570
 and see for example with respect to the inside 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.860
 of the car they want to put sight 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.219
 first person inside the car and you 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.409
 goes from the steering wheel the speedometer and things 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.450
 This is very cool, it's going to take away because 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.670
 nowadays the dashboard of the car in the gp is a 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.009
 Rolled cardboard is not a printed paper. 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.770
 it has no depth it does not have 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.290
 nothing then if they did it would be 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.790
 It's pretty cool at this point so I guess 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.360
 that we can agree that it would be 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.770
 cool 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.330
 first- person view improvement 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.400
 of first-person vision also wants 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.970
 say an improvement in the 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.950
 details on the textures and things of the style 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.200
 but I do not know if you can transform the 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.210
 gta a fps from the galley 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.290
 when we saw the news of this 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.820
 very relative 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.160
 for example that will trigger the 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.930
 new game mode may be for example the 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.880
 cnn things in this first business 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.170
 not necessarily because 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.310
 will be in the middle of the campaign a part 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.870
 of the forest will be able to choose between 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.670
 they are in the first person 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.220
 I honestly think India 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.670
 indonesia and tea does not allow a 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.250
 first good person, right, it's not crazy. 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.170
 he is a ted persona is because you get 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.390
 coverage in places is because you 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.210
 need to have a view out many 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.880
 times just so I do not know if the flash 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.170
 persson works there in India in 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.580
 we know 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.950
 okay so I believe that if they are 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.590
 put a first person will be 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.850
 very different type will have a mode 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.470
 unique to this because the movement 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.180
 the character will have to be different 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.220
 It has to be less caught. 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.959
 it does not make much sense to 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.420
 first person and a play style with the 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.820
 costum gta I honestly hope that 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.709
 Rockstar, surprise me, I got it. 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.140
 confirming the good pole they put 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.209
 a complete list of tickets 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.880
 mentioned then you wanted to talk 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.350
 which is one of the 12 points they speak 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.240
 about graphic improvement 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.770
 the second also the graphic in general 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.980
 then you see farther have 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:46.380
 texture better people have a lot of content 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.900
 of new gameplay then what he talks about 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.150
 about young people in the new online mode 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.490
 New cars sign in the 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.760
 consolidation mode properties of the 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:59.420
 character and more 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.080
 also talk about the fact that you will have 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.860
 pretty cool 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.230
 us is how the person 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.120
 probably will have an editor mode 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.440
 indy videos and will have four who do not know 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:12.300
 generated many machines in the sensational and 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:16.250
 gta5 giving this video tool this 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:18.419
 shows the strength of video production is 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.669
 independent so everyone has access to 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.250
 to this video creation mode gta will 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.410
 to be simply 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.610
 and also talk here about this 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.020
 business of the first person I spoke to 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.530
 from inside the car with improvements in 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.690
 graphics of the speedometer is etc. 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.840
 is a new first person mode for the 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:38.120
 character walk a number of new 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.070
 easter eggs sinfic wacky new easter 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.050
 We are going to marry a lot of things. 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.850
 Sunday for story mode in 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.220
 animals walk by the saints possibly 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.750
 animals in gt as well as nike a 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.340
 old promise of rockstar and even 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.050
 customization is always that 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.460
 the shopping mall business there that 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.020
 download Playmate of the application 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.290
 Flemish it does not count is not the 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:00.290
 personalization defect in the door of the bug 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:03.800
 from transferring characters to the 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:07.760
 xbox and 103 for the next generation for whom 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.620
 to track the generation of consoles 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.540
 Not right, people, guys, like I said that. 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.180
 although obviously it excites me the vision 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.410
 in first person in gta it seems to me like 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.930
 I said I think hygiene does not 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.850
 supports the mod it looks very strange but 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.410
 legal first person mode if you see that the 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.720
 game would look cool in first mode 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.820
 person but I honestly believe in 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.830
 First person mode is an image one 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.020
 bit strange even I think 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.210
 this news this business of davi person 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.710
 He was killed and five people side right now 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.540
 We 're living a certain day. 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.620
 problem on the internet that has a 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.050
 novelty 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.120
 staff like the public republic 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.979
 this novelty for the sake of the public is only 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.450
 I did not give one analyzed and such I stayed 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:46.130
 annoyed with most of the material 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.990
 that it was because no one seems to 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.870
 guys no gta games connected to her 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:54.080
 played once each of the games and such 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:55.940
 birosca goes to person and such a gazin 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.930
 people who handle are connected to people think 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.220
 It 's cool, you open this space. 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.930
 for discussion 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.790
 now there are a lot of people who only notice 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.040
 To win, see, do not you fuck this, but 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:06.410
 Anyway, like I said jokingly saying there 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.060
 in the description the source the pole goal and there 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.910
 inside you have a website a link that goes 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.590
 take you straight to the cast of the bagasse 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.300
 deserve to click on what you think is cute 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.640
 and you can see died we could not 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.990
 open a 404 error if someone else 

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.340
 able to solve can have no 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.950
 comment also how it solves this 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.120
 fucking panicat power this doll again 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.710
 personal beauty 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.570
 If you liked the video, I do not want it. 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.220
 work leaving the dream your favorite 

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:30.680
 subscribe to the channel for much more 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.479
 content I mainly want to know the 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.590
 opinion of you in the field of 

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:36.630
 comments leave what you 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.280
 coffin in a first person way in gt 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.350
 the sec exists in June for this 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.910
 honestly I do not think so 

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:44.100
 I honestly think they can be put 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:46.800
 really that first person mode goes 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:48.270
 change a lot in gta goes another way 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.000
 specific game for that some 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:53.400
 thing that still does not fit because I 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.900
 I do not think I do not think it's feasible to put 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.520
 the way of seeing him personally 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.870
 remembering there is already a first mode 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.450
 person has already learned when you use 

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:02.700
 your releases you your rifle 

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:05.070
 you enter the character's view then 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:07.230
 here is already considered a first mode 

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.150
 person then also novelty is not much 

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:10.890
 of course not 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:13.230
 but they understood each other by seeing the
