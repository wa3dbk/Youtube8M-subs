00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
works I'd say 98% there's one little

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.719

corner<00:01:12.619> where<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.799> can<00:01:13.950> see<00:01:14.159> like<00:01:14.369> there<00:01:14.580> was

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
corner where you can see like there was

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.010 
corner where you can see like there was
like<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:15.119> don't<00:01:15.299> know<00:01:15.360> some<00:01:15.570> dirt<00:01:15.750> or<00:01:15.900> something

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
like I don't know some dirt or something

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.870 
like I don't know some dirt or something
inside<00:01:16.439> so<00:01:16.560> it's<00:01:16.710> not<00:01:16.770> exactly<00:01:16.920> perfect<00:01:17.700> but

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
inside so it's not exactly perfect but

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.929 
inside so it's not exactly perfect but
the<00:01:18.000> thing<00:01:18.210> works<00:01:18.630> exactly<00:01:19.409> like<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.490> should

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
the thing works exactly like it should

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.570 
the thing works exactly like it should
works<00:01:21.420> perfectly<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.770> screens<00:01:23.009> just<00:01:23.250> a

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
works perfectly the screens just a

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.980 
works perfectly the screens just a
little<00:01:23.820> bit<00:01:23.909> damaged<00:01:24.210> but<00:01:24.390> not<00:01:24.420> like<00:01:24.780> I

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
little bit damaged but not like I

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.260 
little bit damaged but not like I
drowned<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.400> it's<00:01:26.520> on<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.759> present<00:01:27.090> dead

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
be patient because the longer you leave

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.240 
be patient because the longer you leave
it<00:02:02.759> in<00:02:02.880> there<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.899> more<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.170> rice<00:02:04.680> will

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
it in there the more the rice will

you know it's kind of like one of those

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.640 
you know it's kind of like one of those
you<00:02:11.849> know<00:02:11.970> home<00:02:12.270> Ram

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
you know home Ram

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.670 
you know home Ram
but<00:02:13.370> in<00:02:13.610> my<00:02:13.790> case<00:02:14.090> it<00:02:14.329> definitely<00:02:15.140> worked<00:02:15.409> and

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
but in my case it definitely worked and

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.740 
but in my case it definitely worked and
it's<00:02:16.549> you<00:02:16.760> know<00:02:16.879> at<00:02:17.090> least<00:02:17.239> it's<00:02:17.450> worth<00:02:17.599> a<00:02:17.720> shot

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
it's you know at least it's worth a shot

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.890 
it's you know at least it's worth a shot
instead<00:02:18.290> of<00:02:18.409> just<00:02:18.560> throwing<00:02:18.769> the<00:02:18.950> thing<00:02:19.159> away

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
instead of just throwing the thing away

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.449 
instead of just throwing the thing away
you<00:02:20.900> can<00:02:21.049> go<00:02:21.170> buy<00:02:21.349> some<00:02:21.560> real<00:02:21.769> rice<00:02:22.010> oh<00:02:22.220> yeah

you can go buy some real rice oh yeah

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:23.619 
you can go buy some real rice oh yeah
and<00:02:22.670> that's<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:22.849> other<00:02:22.970> thing<00:02:23.060> don't<00:02:23.390> use

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629
