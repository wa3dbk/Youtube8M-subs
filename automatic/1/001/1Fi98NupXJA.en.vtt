some I honestly think that my mixture is
way<00:01:25.170> better<00:01:26.840> because<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.740> actual<00:01:29.070> some<00:01:29.250> more

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
way better because the actual some more

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.480 
way better because the actual some more
cereal<00:01:29.970> doesn't<00:01:30.180> even<00:01:30.420> have<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:31.490> graham
