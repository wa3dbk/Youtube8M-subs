realize is the

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.790 
realize is the
after<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:11.790> say<00:02:12.060> fire<00:02:12.360> your<00:02:12.600> weapon<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:13.650> are

still visible on the enemy's radar for a

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.340 
still visible on the enemy's radar for a
certain<00:02:17.730> short<00:02:18.360> period<00:02:18.660> of<00:02:18.750> time<00:02:18.930> but<00:02:19.140> it's

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
certain short period of time but it's

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.280

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
still a period of time so don't think oh

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.830 
still a period of time so don't think oh
I<00:02:22.350> I<00:02:22.650> fired<00:02:23.340> my<00:02:23.460> weapon<00:02:23.490> I<00:02:23.910> stopped<00:02:24.210> they<00:02:24.600> can't

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
I I fired my weapon I stopped they can't

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.660 
I I fired my weapon I stopped they can't
see<00:02:25.050> me<00:02:25.230> anymore<00:02:25.350> so<00:02:26.130> they're<00:02:26.310> not<00:02:26.430> going<00:02:26.610> to

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
see me anymore so they're not going to

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.610 
see me anymore so they're not going to
know<00:02:26.850> which<00:02:27.240> direction<00:02:27.600> I<00:02:27.990> go<00:02:28.170> if<00:02:28.320> I<00:02:28.410> just

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
know which direction I go if I just

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.560 
know which direction I go if I just
start<00:02:28.830> walking<00:02:29.040> some<00:02:29.520> direction<00:02:30.000> they

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
start walking some direction they

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.100 
start walking some direction they
probably<00:02:30.840> will<00:02:31.290> know<00:02:31.850> so<00:02:32.850> keep<00:02:33.690> that<00:02:33.900> in<00:02:33.960> mind

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
probably will know so keep that in mind

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.310 
probably will know so keep that in mind
and<00:02:34.970> now<00:02:35.970> we're<00:02:36.090> going<00:02:36.180> to<00:02:36.240> move<00:02:36.360> on<00:02:36.570> to<00:02:36.750> tip

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
and now we're going to move on to tip

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.480 
and now we're going to move on to tip
number<00:02:37.350> two<00:02:37.850> be<00:02:38.850> mindful<00:02:39.240> of<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.630> objective

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
number two be mindful of the objective

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.680 
number two be mindful of the objective
this<00:02:41.490> is<00:02:42.350> especially<00:02:43.350> important<00:02:44.040> in<00:02:44.690> the

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
this is especially important in the

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.330 
this is especially important in the
objective<00:02:46.170> game<00:02:46.320> modes<00:02:46.380> missile<00:02:46.890> assault<00:02:47.160> and

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
objective game modes missile assault and

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.710 
objective game modes missile assault and
siege<00:02:47.580> but<00:02:48.540> is<00:02:48.750> often<00:02:49.110> forgotten<00:02:49.500> in<00:02:50.720> things

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
siege but is often forgotten in things

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.950 
siege but is often forgotten in things
in<00:02:52.080> the<00:02:52.620> def<00:02:53.010> match<00:02:53.220> in<00:02:53.460> TDM<00:02:53.850> in<00:02:54.090> deathmatch

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
in the def match in TDM in deathmatch

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.550 
in the def match in TDM in deathmatch
your<00:02:55.770> goal<00:02:56.070> is<00:02:56.400> to<00:02:56.910> score<00:02:57.420> as<00:02:57.540> many<00:02:57.570> points<00:02:58.080> as

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
your goal is to score as many points as

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.500 
your goal is to score as many points as
possible<00:02:58.620> because<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.910> person<00:03:00.180> who<00:03:00.270> scores

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
possible because the person who scores

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:01.640 
possible because the person who scores
the<00:03:00.600> most<00:03:00.690> points<00:03:00.900> wins

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
the most points wins

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.650 
the most points wins
so<00:03:02.220> do<00:03:03.000> as<00:03:03.180> much<00:03:03.420> damage<00:03:03.450> as<00:03:04.140> possible<00:03:04.460> damage

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
so do as much damage as possible damage

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.480 
so do as much damage as possible damage
directly<00:03:06.660> equates<00:03:07.230> to<00:03:07.380> points<00:03:07.890> because<00:03:08.310> if

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
directly equates to points because if

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.360 
directly equates to points because if
you<00:03:08.640> get<00:03:08.850> like<00:03:09.390> 60%<00:03:09.990> of<00:03:10.590> an<00:03:10.710> assist<00:03:11.100> it's

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
you get like 60% of an assist it's

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.090 
you get like 60% of an assist it's

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
10% of a kill so go for damage and not

getting<00:03:23.160> a<00:03:23.220> high<00:03:23.370> score<00:03:23.400> is<00:03:23.940> good<00:03:24.270> you

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
getting a high score is good you

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
the whole time that's probably not good

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.910 
the whole time that's probably not good
you<00:05:34.420> can<00:05:34.570> use<00:05:34.600> that<00:05:34.990> fuel<00:05:35.200> to<00:05:35.560> gain<00:05:35.740> an

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
reason that's not good you need to use

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.240
