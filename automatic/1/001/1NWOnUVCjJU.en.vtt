got an n64 controller here that i modded

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.919 
got an n64 controller here that i modded
and<00:00:07.770> put<00:00:07.950> a<00:00:08.130> weed<00:00:08.910> power<00:00:09.179> a<00:00:09.330> mini<00:00:09.690> controller

and nunchuck inside up I've done a
couple<00:00:14.219> things<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.610> it<00:00:14.759> I've<00:00:14.910> changed<00:00:15.509> the

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:16.279 
couple things to it I've changed the

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.220 
couple things to it I've changed the
analog<00:00:17.279> stick<00:00:17.580> here<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:17.970> did<00:00:18.390> that<00:00:18.570> with<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.869> one

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
analog stick here I did that with a one

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.480 
analog stick here I did that with a one
of<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.380> replacement<00:00:19.890> ones<00:00:20.010> just<00:00:20.279> so<00:00:20.369> it<00:00:20.430> was

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
of the replacement ones just so it was

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.599 
of the replacement ones just so it was
easier<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.910> adapt<00:00:21.779> it<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.230> add<00:00:22.769> it<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.490> Wii

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
easier to adapt it and add it to the Wii

another<00:00:25.410> thing<00:00:25.619> I've<00:00:25.740> done<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:26.070> I've<00:00:26.189> just

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
another thing I've done is I've just

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.759 
another thing I've done is I've just
added<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.730> power<00:00:27.390> switch<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.680> the

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
added the power switch and the and the

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:29.929 
added the power switch and the and the
light<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.070> let<00:00:29.160> you<00:00:29.279> know<00:00:29.400> if<00:00:29.490> it's<00:00:29.609> on<00:00:29.670> or<00:00:29.849> not

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939

the<00:00:30.900> reason<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.380> went<00:00:31.500> ahead<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.740> made

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
the reason that I went ahead and made

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.000 
the reason that I went ahead and made
this<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.340> because<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.840> n64<00:00:33.840> rat-boy<00:00:34.649> tap

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
this is because of the n64 rat-boy tap

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.310 
this is because of the n64 rat-boy tap
that's<00:00:35.250> currently<00:00:35.790> out<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.320> recently

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
that's currently out and recently

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.100 
that's currently out and recently
they've<00:00:37.829> updated<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.750> included<00:00:39.750> bluesy

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
they've updated it and included bluesy

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.670 
they've updated it and included bluesy
IME<00:00:40.530> within<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.190> app<00:00:41.309> as<00:00:41.610> well<00:00:42.300> as<00:00:42.540> put<00:00:43.440> in<00:00:43.559> an

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
IME within the app as well as put in an

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.139 
IME within the app as well as put in an
analogue<00:00:44.040> function<00:00:44.579> so<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.000> can

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
analogue function so that you can

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.610 
analogue function so that you can
actually<00:00:45.300> have<00:00:45.510> responsive<00:00:45.899> analog<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.410> walk

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
actually have responsive analog and walk

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.220 
actually have responsive analog and walk
slow<00:00:46.950> for<00:00:47.280> games<00:00:47.520> like<00:00:47.760> mario<00:00:48.649> 64<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:51.230> zelda

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
slow for games like mario 64 and zelda

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.240 
slow for games like mario 64 and zelda
and<00:00:52.289> things<00:00:52.469> like<00:00:52.559> that<00:00:52.620> where<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:52.920> actually

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
and things like that where you actually

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.250 
and things like that where you actually
want<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.489> move<00:00:53.640> move<00:00:54.090> slowly<00:00:54.449> in<00:00:54.719> some<00:00:54.899> areas

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
want to move move slowly in some areas

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.430 
want to move move slowly in some areas
so<00:00:56.070> i<00:00:56.370> came<00:00:56.940> up<00:00:56.969> with<00:00:57.210> this<00:00:57.329> here<00:00:57.539> it's<00:00:57.930> all<00:00:58.170> all

in there make sure it's lined up slides
in<00:01:30.060> pops<00:01:30.329> in<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:31.110> doesn't<00:01:31.320> come<00:01:31.560> out<00:01:31.650> very<00:01:31.710> far

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
in pops in it doesn't come out very far

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.140 
in pops in it doesn't come out very far
at<00:01:32.159> all<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.310> looks<00:01:32.430> pretty<00:01:32.640> nice<00:01:32.759> get<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.030> lined

at all it looks pretty nice get it lined

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.020 
at all it looks pretty nice get it lined
up<00:01:33.299> nice<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.540> straight<00:01:33.869> in<00:01:33.930> there<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:35.030> then

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
up nice and straight in there and then

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.060 
up nice and straight in there and then
all<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:37.140> do<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.439> connect<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.600> turn<00:01:39.600> the

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
all you do to connect it is turn the

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.090 
all you do to connect it is turn the
power<00:01:41.070> on<00:01:41.189> there<00:01:41.570> so<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.720> we<00:01:42.780> got<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.100> light

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
power on there so that we got the light

you can see it when you uh this is the

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.760 
you can see it when you uh this is the
main<00:03:12.180> reason<00:03:12.300> why<00:03:12.480> I<00:03:12.900> built<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.410> controller

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
main reason why I built the controller

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.770 
main reason why I built the controller
so<00:03:14.760> that<00:03:14.910> you<00:03:15.030> could<00:03:15.180> make<00:03:15.630> him<00:03:16.040> just<00:03:17.040> slowly

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
so that you could make him just slowly

lot of parts of the game is something

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.970 
lot of parts of the game is something
you<00:03:24.060> need<00:03:24.180> to<00:03:24.300> just<00:03:24.600> slowly<00:03:24.810> move<00:03:25.140> and<00:03:25.410> it's<00:03:25.890> a

you need to just slowly move and it's a

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.680 
you need to just slowly move and it's a
pretty<00:03:26.430> knowing<00:03:26.700> having<00:03:26.880> to<00:03:27.000> use<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.270> on<00:03:27.420> on
