00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.559
 at reggio calabria how it goes we are charged 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.809
 the climate is good and I have seen that the 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:40.060
 track is already beautiful nice trip tella 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:43.540
 so we are ready to 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:45.940
 to start boys your yours is born 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.280
 in 2003 he obviously asked to go immediately 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.110
 to the worldwide success for your mash 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.660
 very much appreciated what I want 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.780
 ask why according to you and the match 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:59.570
 up people like it because it is a mixture 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.780
 of famous stuff that can 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.989
 current with 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.270
 a mixture of situations that can 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.750
 however they usually work 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.720
 in pizzas both in Italy and abroad 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.450
 you have produces so you have something in 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.790
 hot oven so we have two things 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.830
 one regards the bootleg scope we are 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.520
 working on the new buzzi that for the 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.450
 Lovers of the genre is a mashup album 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.180
 woods 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.070
 obviously there will be different ones etc is 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.780
 another thing for tracks instead 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.490
 originals we have an outgoing ep that 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.009
 obviously they are a little longer 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.450
 because there are major record companies 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.409
 labels so it will take a little longer than 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.590
 time 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:46.060
