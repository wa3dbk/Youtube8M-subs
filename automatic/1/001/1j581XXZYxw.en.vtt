spectrum<00:00:55.720> board<00:00:55.960> is<00:00:56.320> because<00:00:57.010> it's<00:00:57.310> a

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
spectrum board is because it's a

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.370 
spectrum board is because it's a
progression<00:00:57.850> model<00:00:58.390> meaning<00:00:58.630> this<00:00:59.079> board

techniques and how this board is built
the<00:01:58.270> core<00:01:58.659> is<00:01:58.990> Polonia<00:01:59.770> wood<00:02:00.100> which<00:02:00.549> is<00:02:00.759> a

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
the core is Polonia wood which is a

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.270 
the core is Polonia wood which is a
really<00:02:01.060> lightweight<00:02:01.420> hardwood<00:02:02.320> and<00:02:02.650> that's

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
really lightweight hardwood and that's

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.370 
really lightweight hardwood and that's
the<00:02:03.430> good<00:02:03.640> base<00:02:03.909> foundation<00:02:04.600> for<00:02:04.869> controlling

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
the good base foundation for controlling

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:12.130 
the good base foundation for controlling
the<00:02:05.470> flex<00:02:05.850> draw<00:02:06.850> from<00:02:07.780> there

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.020 

and<00:02:12.350> that<00:02:12.560> also<00:02:12.770> helps<00:02:13.190> it<00:02:13.340> to<00:02:13.490> give<00:02:13.640> it<00:02:13.670> or

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
and that also helps it to give it or

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.510 
and that also helps it to give it or
durability<00:02:14.600> with<00:02:15.080> misters<00:02:15.650> our<00:02:15.830> fuel<00:02:16.130> and

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
durability with misters our fuel and

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.220 
durability with misters our fuel and
then<00:02:16.850> I<00:02:16.940> put<00:02:17.090> a<00:02:17.120> top<00:02:17.360> of<00:02:17.540> bottom<00:02:17.840> sheet<00:02:18.020> on<00:02:18.200> top

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
then I put a top of bottom sheet on top

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.550 
then I put a top of bottom sheet on top
of<00:02:18.560> that<00:02:18.680> to<00:02:18.890> protect<00:02:19.250> it<00:02:19.400> from<00:02:19.520> scratches

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
of that to protect it from scratches
