what else I bought will see power

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.979 
what else I bought will see power
steering<00:03:03.510> repair<00:03:04.380> kit<00:03:04.680> so<00:03:04.920> this<00:03:05.100> is<00:03:05.989> actually

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
steering repair kit so this is actually

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:12.620 
steering repair kit so this is actually
what<00:03:07.530> sealing<00:03:07.920> tip<00:03:10.040> got<00:03:11.040> a<00:03:11.070> bunch<00:03:12.000> of<00:03:12.090> gaskets

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
what sealing tip got a bunch of gaskets

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.900 
what sealing tip got a bunch of gaskets
as<00:03:12.840> well<00:03:13.080> as<00:03:13.290> over<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.160> it<00:03:14.340> looks<00:03:14.519> like<00:03:14.580> I

press<00:03:28.320> but<00:03:28.769> I<00:03:29.010> can<00:03:29.970> try<00:03:30.060> to<00:03:30.150> figure<00:03:30.330> something

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
press but I can try to figure something

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.300 
press but I can try to figure something
out<00:03:30.780> but<00:03:30.989> really<00:03:31.470> remember<00:03:31.799> that<00:03:31.950> my<00:03:32.100> power

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310

steering<00:03:32.640> did<00:03:32.790> not<00:03:32.940> work<00:03:34.130> right<00:03:35.130> now<00:03:35.220> did<00:03:35.580> not

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
steering did not work right now did not

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.250 
steering did not work right now did not
work<00:03:35.910> but<00:03:36.150> it<00:03:36.269> was<00:03:36.360> actually<00:03:36.570> leaking<00:03:36.900> pretty

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
work but it was actually leaking pretty

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.000 
work but it was actually leaking pretty
bad<00:03:37.440> so<00:03:37.650> hopefully<00:03:37.799> this<00:03:38.040> little<00:03:38.220> solve<00:03:38.880> it<00:03:39.000> up

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
bad so hopefully this little solve it up
