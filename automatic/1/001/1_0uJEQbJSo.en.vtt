00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello friends of the movie welcome to 

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:06.899
 dvd review and expected in early september 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.500
 all rené marik fans probably 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.719
 one of the most anticipated kinostart 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.160
 2013 in German cinemas I have the 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.809
 film seen in advance and had to 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.880
 find out it's a proper portion 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:22.670
 matter of taste but more on that later 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.670
 because now it's about money or auto 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.430
 Once Upon a time 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.430
 the cabaret duo 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.890
 but success 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:50.340
 creates enemies like a theater of 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:52.700
 defend joy and her nasty plan 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.700
 just short 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:11.820
 We have to think like that first 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.240
 Raise 50,000 you have probably 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.240
 not stupid 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:27.700
 constantly these excesses 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:33.189
 spox arises in the circle day 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:35.430
 you can not see that I thought 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:35.430
 crap 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.620
 maybe more will come 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:01.050
 that's just about kidnapping sigaty calls 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:01.050
 office as president of you 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.760
 yeah yeah 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.090
 Money or slides is 96 minutes away 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.510
 is released from twelve years and 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.340
 runs from 5 september 2013 in the 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.320
 German cinemas and tells the 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.000
 story from the cabaret trio das 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.950
 actually works well with the known 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.680
 dolls of rené marik alle falkenhorst 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.360
 and moles they live a life like 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.860
 Mine as an artist can only enjoy before 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.110
 the stage the shops go well only 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.360
 kalle lowers the nose but a small 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.280
 a little too often into the cocaine and that too has 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.020
 as a result, this results in a whole lot 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.730
 there are still accumulations of debt 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.530
 the story of a small theater 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.000
 called theater of friends and one 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.310
 old companions of kalle that 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.960
 crocodile what so bad money needs 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.700
 to save one's own theater has become 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.560
 then mafia structures history 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.810
 still in there where the whole a small one 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.850
 Chase ends with, among other things 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.160
 christoph maria herbst is the drama 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.890
 perfect and 96 minutes of entertainment 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.210
 guaranteed for all the rené marik so 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.280
 really like because I was on the 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.960
 there were many like the premiere there 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.340
 crowdfunding that partly to the film 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.810
 who participated is reason that is 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.010
 the real viewer really money 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.960
 donated to this film 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.730
 produce for it at the premiere 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.140
 The were allowed to have fun and 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.360
 have at the film at many ten 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.920
 partly laughed almost dead so that 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.810
 that hardly ever happened like that 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.940
 but for all the rené marik dislike 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.320
 that is a very different thing and exactly 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.850
 I would like that here three times 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.590
 emphasize at this point who 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.140
 this man and this whole stage 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.940
 puppenshow of all muppet are essential 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.140
 less budgeted the form somehow 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.520
 the partly also quite brutal 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.530
 and with pretty strong slogans 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.790
 Therefore, it should be the film should be 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.320
 maybe to her because I do not have 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.850
 the feeling that he was so insane in 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.650
 Everyone would run the German cinemas 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.230
 I would absolutely advise against it 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.000
 because while many fans in the cinema right 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.130
 It was fun for me the whole movie 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.810
 Almost a veil what so funny 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.489
 At the strip I find the 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.260
 trailer to the movie about three times better 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.090
 as the movie already I found that honest 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.440
 said bad and that was then 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.180
 At some point, if you have something 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.220
 not at all funny you will find the 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.140
 Almost all year round it almost gets cloudy 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.730
 is annoying and so it went to me and 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.489
 I liked the mole so much for one 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.440
 two minutes I find the funny 96 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.580
 minutes is just too much and me 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.100
 Hope you can understand what I mean with it 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.750
 my fans who so fans into the cinema 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.850
 watch as long as the film is still on the 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.639
 then the canvas will be on display 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.930
 as I said 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.520
 not be too long in part, 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.020
 otherwise all the others already at 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.340
 to be the trailer that's nothing 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.360
 For me, leave the fingers of it 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.800
 you do not miss anything 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.509
 that is my opinion why 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.830
 christoph maria autumn really becomes 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:40.479
 it also makes me a little stone and 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.490
 why his figure then from now on 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:44.050
 but it gets so insane 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.789
 the whole one then still in fsk 12 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.009
 It can hold me a little too 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:50.289
 ask at this point so what the hell 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:52.090
 that means that here once more the sense 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:53.650
 the genre rating in the foreground 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.169
 kick and I give money yes or too 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.330
 even as a very special niche comedy 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:59.860
 So for all the windows for me if I am 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.139
 would be rating six out of ten 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.330
 possible points from me then overall 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:06.520
 unfortunately a film of this world 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.050
 only one and a half out of 10 possible points 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.669
 and unfortunately that also reflects mine 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.779
 cinematographic experience at this point 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:13.120
 Again I hope you understand what I mean 

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:14.469
 my view is so differentiated 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.819
 how I try to show if you 

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:18.520
 friend that's it else now from me 

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:19.150
 with my us on money or on that 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.830
 terrain 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.360
 if you did this let it stay 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.770
 do not like to look at the last one 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.210
 both cinema critics over or at 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.159
 twitter and facebook around else 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.659
 want to write subscribes to this 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:30.279
 or my two-channel if you do not 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:32.919
 want to miss videos of it with me 

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:34.810
 let it stay but that decides 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:37.000
 only you but tomorrow 15 clock is here 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.500
 at the latest a new video and until then 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.960
 I hope you will be back tomorrow 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.960
 of course on the 3
