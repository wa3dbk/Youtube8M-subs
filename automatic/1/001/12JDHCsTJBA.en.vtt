00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
of a frosty shimmery red it is on the

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.979 
of a frosty shimmery red it is on the
thin<00:01:00.619> side<00:01:00.650> as<00:01:01.339> far<00:01:01.549> as<00:01:01.640> the<00:01:01.760> formula<00:01:02.210> goes<00:01:02.390> so

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
thin side as far as the formula goes so

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.620 
thin side as far as the formula goes so
this<00:01:03.260> is<00:01:03.440> two<00:01:03.680> coats<00:01:04.040> and<00:01:04.580> I<00:01:04.909> would<00:01:05.089> say<00:01:05.330> that

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
this is two coats and I would say that

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.570 
this is two coats and I would say that
if<00:01:05.869> you<00:01:06.049> really<00:01:06.470> want<00:01:06.680> to<00:01:06.920> be<00:01:07.040> sure<00:01:07.220> that<00:01:07.250> the

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
if you really want to be sure that the

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.820 
if you really want to be sure that the
nail<00:01:08.210> line<00:01:08.450> doesn't<00:01:08.659> show<00:01:08.990> too<00:01:09.020> go<00:01:09.439> ahead<00:01:09.680> and

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
nail line doesn't show too go ahead and

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.859 
nail line doesn't show too go ahead and
probably<00:01:10.100> do<00:01:10.460> three<00:01:10.790> thin<00:01:11.060> coats<00:01:11.390> you<00:01:11.720> can

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
probably do three thin coats you can

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:13.899 
probably do three thin coats you can
probably<00:01:12.710> get<00:01:13.010> away<00:01:13.040> with<00:01:13.250> that<00:01:13.549> with<00:01:13.700> that

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
probably get away with that with that

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.140 
probably get away with that with that
frosty<00:01:14.360> shimmer<00:01:14.830> but<00:01:15.830> this<00:01:16.220> is<00:01:16.460> really<00:01:16.880> quite

with<00:01:27.350> inconsistent<00:01:27.920> formula<00:01:28.670> and<00:01:29.320> shrink

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
with inconsistent formula and shrink

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.260 
with inconsistent formula and shrink
back<00:01:30.530> issues<00:01:30.979> depending<00:01:31.460> on<00:01:31.579> how<00:01:31.759> thin<00:01:32.090> the

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
back issues depending on how thin the

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.090 
back issues depending on how thin the
formula<00:01:32.749> is<00:01:32.899> the<00:01:33.109> thinner<00:01:33.320> it<00:01:33.409> is<00:01:33.710> it<00:01:33.950> seems

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
formula is the thinner it is it seems

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.529 
formula is the thinner it is it seems
the<00:01:34.460> more<00:01:34.640> likely<00:01:34.969> you're<00:01:35.119> going<00:01:35.299> to<00:01:35.390> have

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
the more likely you're going to have

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:38.560 
the more likely you're going to have
issues<00:01:35.960> with<00:01:36.170> the<00:01:36.499> shrink<00:01:36.920> back<00:01:37.179> so<00:01:38.179> once

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570

their Candyland collection great opacity

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.479 
their Candyland collection great opacity

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
and two coats this is was a slightly

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.850 
and two coats this is was a slightly
thicker<00:03:20.290> formula<00:03:21.290> for<00:03:21.500> this<00:03:21.620> particular

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
thicker formula for this particular

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.280 
thicker formula for this particular
shade<00:03:22.370> it<00:03:22.730> is<00:03:23.269> a<00:03:23.540> yellow-green<00:03:24.190> that<00:03:25.190> has

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
shade it is a yellow-green that has

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.770 
shade it is a yellow-green that has
shimmer<00:03:27.290> in<00:03:27.920> it<00:03:28.100> and<00:03:28.430> I<00:03:28.489> think<00:03:28.550> the<00:03:29.209> shimmer<00:03:29.540> in

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
shimmer in it and I think the shimmer in

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:37.390 
shimmer in it and I think the shimmer in
it<00:03:29.810> is<00:03:30.170> either<00:03:30.739> a<00:03:31.400> green<00:03:32.060> or<00:03:32.480> a<00:03:32.510> blue<00:03:36.400> shimmer

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
it is either a green or a blue shimmer

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.330 
it is either a green or a blue shimmer
it<00:03:37.610> could<00:03:37.790> be<00:03:37.910> golden<00:03:38.299> -<00:03:38.570> maybe<00:03:39.530> a<00:03:39.650> mix<00:03:39.920> of<00:03:40.130> that

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
it could be golden - maybe a mix of that

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.830 
it could be golden - maybe a mix of that
it's<00:03:41.329> very<00:03:41.660> slight<00:03:41.989> but<00:03:42.560> it<00:03:42.680> is<00:03:42.799> there<00:03:43.420> so<00:03:44.420> once

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840

shimmer<00:05:50.520> this<00:05:51.520> is<00:05:52.000> when<00:05:52.450> this<00:05:52.570> first<00:05:52.750> came<00:05:52.900> out

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:53.200 
shimmer this is when this first came out

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.800 
shimmer this is when this first came out
it<00:05:53.410> was<00:05:53.530> kind<00:05:53.890> of<00:05:54.010> I<00:05:54.130> think<00:05:54.190> a<00:05:54.430> copycat<00:05:54.820> for<00:05:55.390> OPI

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810 
it was kind of I think a copycat for OPI

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:00.590 
it was kind of I think a copycat for OPI
is<00:05:56.160> Russian<00:05:57.160> Navy<00:05:57.430> it<00:05:58.120> is<00:05:58.180> very<00:05:58.540> close<00:05:58.870> to<00:05:59.080> that

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 
is Russian Navy it is very close to that

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.460 
is Russian Navy it is very close to that
the<00:06:01.600> formula<00:06:02.140> is<00:06:02.440> a<00:06:02.500> bit<00:06:03.010> on<00:06:03.280> the<00:06:03.580> thin<00:06:03.820> side

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470 
the formula is a bit on the thin side

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.700 
the formula is a bit on the thin side
and<00:06:06.180> you'll<00:06:07.180> probably<00:06:07.330> need<00:06:07.810> three<00:06:08.020> coats<00:06:08.380> for

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
and you'll probably need three coats for

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.590 
and you'll probably need three coats for
full<00:06:08.890> opacity<00:06:09.250> for<00:06:09.760> this<00:06:11.820> so<00:06:12.820> once<00:06:13.060> again<00:06:13.210> that

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:13.600 
full opacity for this so once again that

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:20.600 
full opacity for this so once again that
is<00:06:13.870> deep<00:06:14.770> sea<00:06:18.330> and<00:06:19.330> our<00:06:19.780> last<00:06:19.990> one<00:06:20.230> here<00:06:20.440> is

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610 
is deep sea and our last one here is

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.810 
is deep sea and our last one here is
cashmere<00:06:21.610> kind<00:06:22.090> of<00:06:22.270> gal<00:06:22.770> this<00:06:23.770> is<00:06:23.830> a<00:06:24.100> concrete

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:24.820 
cashmere kind of gal this is a concrete

cashmere kind of gal this is a concrete
gray<00:06:26.820> polish<00:06:27.820> I<00:06:28.300> did<00:06:28.660> not<00:06:28.840> like<00:06:29.050> to<00:06:29.080> formula<00:06:29.620> on

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:29.770 
gray polish I did not like to formula on

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.100 
gray polish I did not like to formula on
this<00:06:29.980> it<00:06:30.160> was<00:06:30.250> quite<00:06:30.490> streaky<00:06:31.090> on<00:06:31.690> the<00:06:31.870> first

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.110 
this it was quite streaky on the first

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.690 
this it was quite streaky on the first
coat<00:06:32.410> and<00:06:33.750> it<00:06:34.750> took<00:06:34.960> a<00:06:34.990> little<00:06:35.200> working<00:06:35.740> with

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:36.700 
coat and it took a little working with

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.940 
coat and it took a little working with
the<00:06:36.820> Polish<00:06:37.210> I<00:06:37.450> did<00:06:37.690> experience<00:06:38.080> also<00:06:38.500> a<00:06:38.680> bit

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:38.950 
the Polish I did experience also a bit

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:42.510 
the Polish I did experience also a bit
of<00:06:39.070> pitting<00:06:39.370> that<00:06:39.880> I<00:06:40.300> used<00:06:40.570> my<00:06:41.310> polish<00:06:42.310> shaker

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:42.520 
of pitting that I used my polish shaker

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.090 
of pitting that I used my polish shaker
on<00:06:42.850> this<00:06:43.690> particular<00:06:43.990> one<00:06:44.350> and<00:06:44.380> it<00:06:44.710> still<00:06:44.920> did

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:45.100 
on this particular one and it still did

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.850 
on this particular one and it still did
not<00:06:45.130> help<00:06:45.490> with<00:06:45.670> that<00:06:46.230> but<00:06:47.230> working<00:06:47.560> in<00:06:47.770> a

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:47.860 
not help with that but working in a

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.040 
not help with that but working in a
little<00:06:48.010> bit<00:06:48.220> letting<00:06:48.790> it<00:06:49.030> kind<00:06:49.240> of<00:06:49.360> settle<00:06:49.750> and

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:50.050 
little bit letting it kind of settle and

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.990 
little bit letting it kind of settle and
seemed<00:06:50.920> to<00:06:50.950> help<00:06:51.300> it<00:06:52.300> is<00:06:52.480> very<00:06:52.870> pretty
