00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.620 

it's<00:01:05.340> a<00:01:05.489> relationship<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.090> demands

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
it's a relationship that demands

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.030 
it's a relationship that demands
complete<00:01:07.230> mutual<00:01:07.740> trust

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.950 

at<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.820> end<00:01:11.940> of<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.090> day<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.270> know<00:01:12.570> we<00:01:12.690> spent

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
at the end of the day you know we spent

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.410 
at the end of the day you know we spent
220<00:01:13.680> days<00:01:13.800> together<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.940> the<00:01:15.150> year<00:01:15.270> whether

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
220 days together of the year whether

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.330 
220 days together of the year whether
it's<00:01:15.600> testing<00:01:16.020> or<00:01:16.140> competing<00:01:16.620> or<00:01:16.830> whatever<00:01:17.160> it

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
it's testing or competing or whatever it

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.460 
it's testing or competing or whatever it
is<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:18.030> it's<00:01:18.480> quite<00:01:18.660> a<00:01:18.720> relationship<00:01:19.260> when<00:01:19.380> you

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
is so it's quite a relationship when you

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.570 
is so it's quite a relationship when you
actually<00:01:19.590> stop<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.040> think<00:01:20.220> about<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.430> we

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
actually stop and think about it we

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.070 
actually stop and think about it we
spend<00:01:20.820> more<00:01:20.940> time<00:01:21.000> together<00:01:21.360> than<00:01:21.570> we<00:01:21.840> do<00:01:21.930> with
