Tottenham<00:02:16.950> lost<00:02:17.190> before<00:02:17.819> our<00:02:18.390> game<00:02:18.720> so<00:02:19.230> if<00:02:19.319> we

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
Tottenham lost before our game so if we

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.020 
Tottenham lost before our game so if we
had<00:02:19.620> won<00:02:19.890> all<00:02:20.099> our<00:02:20.129> games<00:02:20.550> would<00:02:20.849> have

had won all our games would have

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.430 
had won all our games would have
overtaken<00:02:21.150> them<00:02:21.629> and<00:02:21.810> got<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.050> Europa<00:02:22.410> League

overtaken them and got the Europa League
spot<00:02:23.010> which<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.550> don't<00:02:23.610> think<00:02:23.819> we<00:02:24.090> should<00:02:24.120> be

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
spot which I don't think we should be

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.360 
spot which I don't think we should be
get<00:02:24.629> we<00:02:25.050> should<00:02:25.230> I<00:02:25.260> be<00:02:25.590> getting<00:02:26.190> because

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
get we should I be getting because

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.850 
get we should I be getting because
that'll<00:02:27.180> impact<00:02:27.450> on<00:02:27.660> next<00:02:27.780> season<00:02:28.260> so<00:02:28.680> we've

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
that'll impact on next season so we've

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.860 
that'll impact on next season so we've
lost<00:02:29.099> today<00:02:29.430> so<00:02:29.489> we<00:02:29.700> match<00:02:29.940> Spurs<00:02:30.330> a<00:02:30.360> lot<00:02:30.660> so

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
lost today so we match Spurs a lot so

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.520 
lost today so we match Spurs a lot so
hopefully<00:02:31.290> that'll<00:02:31.530> go<00:02:31.800> a<00:02:32.069> way<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:33.349> helping<00:02:34.349> us

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
hopefully that'll go a way to helping us
