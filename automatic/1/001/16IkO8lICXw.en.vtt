the use of color when I first met with

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.859 
the use of color when I first met with
Colton<00:01:39.509> jackie's<00:01:39.960> we<00:01:40.829> had<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.850> vision<00:01:42.540> for<00:01:42.720> the

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
Colton jackie's we had a vision for the

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.520 
Colton jackie's we had a vision for the
house<00:01:43.049> but<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.159> wanted<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.180> be<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.360> very

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
house but I wanted it to be a very

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.980 
house but I wanted it to be a very
methodical<00:01:46.530> process<00:01:47.240> so<00:01:48.240> we<00:01:48.420> did<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.840> in

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
methodical process so we did it in

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.499 
methodical process so we did it in
phases<00:01:49.500> we<00:01:50.130> were<00:01:50.310> very<00:01:50.460> methodical<00:01:51.149> about<00:01:51.240> our

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
phases we were very methodical about our

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.639 
phases we were very methodical about our
choices<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.579> it<00:01:53.579> was<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:54.509> much<00:01:54.720> more<00:01:54.750> fun<00:01:55.229> and

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
choices and it was so much more fun and

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.030 
choices and it was so much more fun and
probably<00:01:56.040> so<00:01:56.369> much<00:01:56.520> more<00:01:57.229> gratifying<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.740> do

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
probably so much more gratifying to do

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.249 
probably so much more gratifying to do
it<00:01:59.130> in<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.369> way<00:01:59.399> because<00:01:59.729> we<00:02:00.060> truly<00:02:00.509> bonded

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
it in that way because we truly bonded

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.950 
it in that way because we truly bonded
and<00:02:01.560> built<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.430> relationship<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.479> think<00:02:03.750> is

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
and built a relationship that I think is

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.319 
and built a relationship that I think is
reflected<00:02:04.560> in<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.890> house<00:02:05.040> while<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.119> grand

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
reflected in the house while the grand

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.160 
reflected in the house while the grand
scale<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.140> billiard<00:02:07.500> lounge<00:02:07.770> level<00:02:09.170> was

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
scale of the billiard lounge level was

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.550 
scale of the billiard lounge level was
probably<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:11.330> biggest<00:02:12.330> transformation<00:02:13.319> not

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
probably the biggest transformation not

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.820 
probably the biggest transformation not
only

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
only

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.430 
only
was<00:02:13.950> it<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.190> biggest<00:02:14.400> splurge<00:02:15.180> but<00:02:15.600> it<00:02:16.110> also

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
was it the biggest splurge but it also

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.180 
was it the biggest splurge but it also
went<00:02:16.980> through<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.670> greatest<00:02:18.120> transformation

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190
