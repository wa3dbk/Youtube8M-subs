00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
concern when buying any of these cars

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.030 
concern when buying any of these cars
well<00:00:42.870> with<00:00:43.020> all<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.230> snow<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.590> ice<00:00:43.680> we've<00:00:43.920> had

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.069 
well with all the snow and ice we've had
recently<00:00:44.460> my<00:00:44.789> key<00:00:45.000> concern<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.570> probably<00:00:45.870> how

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
recently my key concern is probably how

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.330 
recently my key concern is probably how
these<00:00:46.260> cars<00:00:46.530> are<00:00:46.680> going<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.829> perform<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.280> the

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
these cars are going to perform in the

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.990 
these cars are going to perform in the
wintry<00:00:47.670> weather

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
wintry weather

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.819 
wintry weather
okay<00:00:48.750> well<00:00:48.930> all<00:00:49.020> these<00:00:49.140> cars<00:00:49.350> are<00:00:49.440> brand<00:00:49.680> new

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
okay well all these cars are brand new

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.740 
okay well all these cars are brand new
so<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.190> Volga<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.550> usual<00:00:50.910> safety<00:00:51.120> equipment

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
so the Volga the usual safety equipment

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.930 
so the Volga the usual safety equipment
like<00:00:51.930> abs<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.620> airbags<00:00:52.739> but<00:00:53.699> there<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:53.910> a

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
like abs and airbags but there is a

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.970 
like abs and airbags but there is a
crucial<00:00:54.360> difference<00:00:54.739> these<00:00:55.739> two<00:00:55.949> a

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
crucial difference these two a

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.400 
crucial difference these two a
front-wheel<00:00:56.399> drive<00:00:56.480> the<00:00:57.480> BMW<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.170> rear-wheel

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
front-wheel drive the BMW is rear-wheel

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.650 
front-wheel drive the BMW is rear-wheel
drive<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.730> seborrhea<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.270> four-wheel

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
drive and the seborrhea is four-wheel

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.119 
drive and the seborrhea is four-wheel
drive<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.469> can<00:01:01.710> make<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.890> massive

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
drive and that can make a massive

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.680 
drive and that can make a massive
difference<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.730> how<00:01:02.879> they're<00:01:03.030> handling<00:01:03.390> snow

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
difference to how they're handling snow

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.149 
difference to how they're handling snow
that's<00:01:04.080> why<00:01:04.260> we've<00:01:04.439> brought<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.860> rocket

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
that's why we've brought you to rocket

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.920 
that's why we've brought you to rocket
and<00:01:05.309> it's<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.790> perfect<00:01:06.210> place<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.420> test<00:01:06.720> these

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
and it's a perfect place to test these

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.880 
and it's a perfect place to test these
cars<00:01:07.229> in<00:01:07.439> winter<00:01:07.740> conditions

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.640 

we're<00:01:12.490> here<00:01:12.730> at<00:01:13.000> the<00:01:13.150> skid<00:01:13.360> pan<00:01:13.600> on<00:01:13.810> our<00:01:14.440> first

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
we're here at the skid pan on our first

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.570 
we're here at the skid pan on our first
test<00:01:15.040> is<00:01:15.280> the<00:01:15.850> kick<00:01:16.180> plate<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:18.070> what<00:01:18.250> that<00:01:18.400> does

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
test is the kick plate so what that does

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.160 
test is the kick plate so what that does
is<00:01:18.790> it<00:01:18.910> replicates<00:01:19.330> driving<00:01:19.660> on<00:01:19.750> black<00:01:19.990> ice

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
is it replicates driving on black ice

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.770 
is it replicates driving on black ice
and<00:01:20.500> it<00:01:20.800> will<00:01:20.920> kick<00:01:21.100> the<00:01:21.220> car<00:01:21.370> sideways

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
and it will kick the car sideways

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.150 
and it will kick the car sideways
whenever<00:01:22.780> you<00:01:22.900> hit<00:01:23.050> it<00:01:23.200> at<00:01:23.320> 30<00:01:23.560> miles<00:01:23.770> per<00:01:23.920> hour

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
whenever you hit it at 30 miles per hour

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.070 
whenever you hit it at 30 miles per hour
so<00:01:25.000> what<00:01:25.090> you<00:01:25.180> have<00:01:25.270> to<00:01:25.330> do<00:01:25.450> is<00:01:25.540> steer<00:01:25.810> into<00:01:25.960> the

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
so what you have to do is steer into the

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.530 
so what you have to do is steer into the
skid<00:01:26.170> and<00:01:26.620> then<00:01:26.980> drive<00:01:27.220> up<00:01:27.250> to<00:01:27.490> the<00:01:27.610> end<00:01:27.700> should

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
skid and then drive up to the end should

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.130 
skid and then drive up to the end should
we<00:01:28.600> give<00:01:28.720> it<00:01:28.750> a<00:01:28.870> go

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
we give it a go

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:40.930 
we give it a go
yeah<00:01:29.380> let's<00:01:29.710> do<00:01:29.860> this<00:01:29.980> it

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.270 

how<00:01:41.450> did<00:01:41.600> you<00:01:41.660> find<00:01:41.780> that<00:01:41.960> I<00:01:42.200> didn't<00:01:43.010> kick<00:01:43.130> out

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
how did you find that I didn't kick out

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.040 
how did you find that I didn't kick out
as<00:01:43.400> much<00:01:43.580> as<00:01:43.730> I<00:01:43.790> thought<00:01:43.940> it<00:01:44.120> might<00:01:44.570> do<00:01:44.780> you

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
as much as I thought it might do you

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.890 
as much as I thought it might do you
could<00:01:45.200> feel<00:01:45.380> the<00:01:45.560> car<00:01:45.770> I'm<00:01:46.480> correcting<00:01:47.480> itself

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
could feel the car I'm correcting itself

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.290 
could feel the car I'm correcting itself
and<00:01:48.320> down<00:01:48.980> a<00:01:49.010> straight<00:01:49.340> road<00:01:49.550> that<00:01:49.790> that<00:01:50.150> would

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
and down a straight road that that would

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
this is rear-wheel drive and sort of a

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:33.070 
this is rear-wheel drive and sort of a
bit<00:02:23.720> harder<00:02:24.020> to<00:02:24.050> control<00:02:31.750> what<00:02:32.750> you<00:02:32.780> think<00:02:33.020> of

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
bit harder to control what you think of

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.030 
bit harder to control what you think of
that<00:02:34.090> again<00:02:35.090> out<00:02:35.750> of<00:02:35.930> control<00:02:36.290> and<00:02:36.590> you<00:02:36.920> know

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
that again out of control and you know

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.860 
that again out of control and you know
once<00:02:37.250> you<00:02:37.370> lose<00:02:37.550> the<00:02:37.580> back<00:02:37.850> end<00:02:37.880> I<00:02:38.240> really

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
once you lose the back end I really

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.350 
once you lose the back end I really
struggle<00:02:39.200> to<00:02:39.230> bring<00:02:39.410> it<00:02:39.530> back<00:02:40.030> it's<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.150> sort

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
struggle to bring it back it's the sort

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.580 
struggle to bring it back it's the sort
of<00:02:41.390> thing<00:02:41.600> that<00:02:41.630> I<00:02:41.810> didn't<00:02:42.230> learn<00:02:42.380> at<00:02:42.560> my

this<00:02:49.220> car<00:02:49.430> is<00:02:49.730> four-wheel<00:02:50.210> drive<00:02:50.870> never

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
this car is four-wheel drive never

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.780 
this car is four-wheel drive never
driven<00:02:51.530> a<00:02:51.680> four-wheel<00:02:51.980> drive<00:02:52.040> before<00:02:52.520> so<00:02:52.670> this

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
driven a four-wheel drive before so this

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:53.680 
driven a four-wheel drive before so this
should<00:02:52.940> be<00:02:52.970> interesting

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
should be interesting

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.360 
should be interesting
unlike<00:02:54.080> the<00:02:54.170> other<00:02:54.320> cars<00:02:54.620> this<00:02:54.890> car<00:02:55.130> doesn't

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
unlike the other cars this car doesn't

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.450 
unlike the other cars this car doesn't
have<00:02:55.520> any<00:02:56.450> safety<00:02:56.810> systems<00:02:57.380> instead<00:02:58.370> it

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
have any safety systems instead it

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.300 
have any safety systems instead it
relies<00:02:58.610> on<00:02:58.760> its<00:02:59.090> four-wheel<00:02:59.450> drive<00:02:59.690> system<00:03:00.310> um

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
relies on its four-wheel drive system um

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.020 
relies on its four-wheel drive system um
I<00:03:01.730> felt<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.270> kick<00:03:02.590> as<00:03:03.590> with<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:03.980> others<00:03:04.220> but

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.700 

I<00:03:32.030> just<00:03:33.030> found<00:03:33.180> that<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.810> front<00:03:34.080> part<00:03:34.560> of<00:03:34.620> the

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:34.710 
I just found that the front part of the

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.080 
I just found that the front part of the
car<00:03:34.890> slipping<00:03:35.250> away<00:03:35.460> from<00:03:35.580> me<00:03:35.730> as<00:03:35.880> I<00:03:35.970> was

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
car slipping away from me as I was

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.730 
car slipping away from me as I was
trying<00:03:36.300> to<00:03:36.450> turn<00:03:36.600> into<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.900> bend<00:03:37.080> yeah<00:03:37.560> that's

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740 
trying to turn into the bend yeah that's

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.200 
trying to turn into the bend yeah that's
called<00:03:37.920> understeer<00:03:38.430> it's<00:03:38.610> and<00:03:38.850> it's<00:03:39.060> like<00:03:39.180> a

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.210 
called understeer it's and it's like a

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:40.610 
called understeer it's and it's like a
common<00:03:39.600> characteristic<00:03:39.990> of<00:03:40.290> front-wheel

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
common characteristic of front-wheel

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.920 
common characteristic of front-wheel
drive<00:03:40.650> cars<00:03:41.100> it's<00:03:41.430> and<00:03:41.670> just<00:03:41.940> it<00:03:42.570> real<00:03:42.750> amount

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
drive cars it's and just it real amount

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.200 
drive cars it's and just it real amount
of<00:03:43.050> grip<00:03:46.190> so<00:03:47.190> here<00:03:47.340> we<00:03:47.430> are<00:03:47.460> in<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:47.730> Gulf<00:03:47.940> and

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.210 
of grip so here we are in the Gulf and

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:57.570 
of grip so here we are in the Gulf and
same<00:03:48.810> thing<00:03:48.840> again<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.710> slalom<00:03:50.040> course

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.340 

I<00:03:57.730> feel<00:03:58.210> there's<00:03:58.450> sort<00:03:58.690> of<00:03:58.750> traction<00:03:58.930> control

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
I feel there's sort of traction control

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.380 
I feel there's sort of traction control
it<00:03:59.680> handle<00:03:59.980> pretty<00:04:00.160> sharpish<00:04:00.670> it<00:04:00.880> there<00:04:01.300> was

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
it handle pretty sharpish it there was

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.480 
it handle pretty sharpish it there was
no<00:04:01.510> major<00:04:01.720> spin-out<00:04:02.370> felt<00:04:03.370> pretty

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.490 
no major spin-out felt pretty

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:10.060 
no major spin-out felt pretty
comfortable

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.740 

okay<00:04:11.070> so<00:04:11.130> let's<00:04:11.400> try<00:04:11.550> the<00:04:11.670> slalom<00:04:12.090> line<00:04:12.510> the

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
okay so let's try the slalom line the

just<00:05:08.700> imagine<00:05:09.090> this<00:05:09.210> size<00:05:09.480> a<00:05:09.780> slippery

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
just imagine this size a slippery

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.800 
just imagine this size a slippery
Junction<00:05:11.190> so<00:05:12.000> you're<00:05:12.120> pulling<00:05:12.420> oh<00:05:12.510> there's<00:05:12.780> a

Junction so you're pulling oh there's a
car<00:05:13.050> coming<00:05:13.230> you<00:05:13.500> need<00:05:13.620> to<00:05:13.680> go<00:05:13.770> out<00:05:13.860> other<00:05:14.010> way

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
car coming you need to go out other way

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.200 
car coming you need to go out other way
as<00:05:14.190> quickly<00:05:14.400> as<00:05:14.580> possible

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210

so I want you to just put your foot to
the<00:05:16.680> floor<00:05:16.800> and<00:05:16.920> variable

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.000 

it<00:05:33.210> doesn't<00:05:33.570> all<00:05:33.720> four<00:05:33.990> cars<00:05:34.260> now<00:05:34.470> on<00:05:34.830> that

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
it doesn't all four cars now on that

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.970 
it doesn't all four cars now on that
slippery<00:05:35.280> surface<00:05:35.820> what<00:05:36.450> do<00:05:36.540> you<00:05:36.630> think<00:05:36.980> the

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980 
slippery surface what do you think the

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.500 
slippery surface what do you think the
four-wheel<00:05:38.310> drive<00:05:38.580> makes<00:05:39.090> such<00:05:39.330> a<00:05:39.360> difference

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
four-wheel drive makes such a difference

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:40.850 
four-wheel drive makes such a difference
of<00:05:40.170> pulling<00:05:40.560> away

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
of pulling away

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.520 
of pulling away
you<00:05:41.670> can<00:05:41.820> feel<00:05:42.030> it<00:05:42.180> on<00:05:42.210> the<00:05:42.390> surface<00:05:42.600> head<00:05:43.410> and

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
you can feel it on the surface head and

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.440 
you can feel it on the surface head and
shoulders<00:05:43.890> above<00:05:43.920> the<00:05:44.370> rest<00:05:44.610> and<00:05:44.940> and<00:05:45.060> and<00:05:45.330> it

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450 
shoulders above the rest and and and it

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.030 
shoulders above the rest and and and it
could<00:05:45.630> make<00:05:45.780> a<00:05:45.810> massive<00:05:46.110> difference<00:05:46.290> yeah

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:47.040 
could make a massive difference yeah

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.170 
could make a massive difference yeah
pulling<00:05:47.400> away<00:05:47.490> in<00:05:47.640> front<00:05:47.880> of<00:05:48.030> an<00:05:48.120> oncoming

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
pulling away in front of an oncoming

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.730 
pulling away in front of an oncoming
truck<00:05:48.660> it<00:05:48.810> doesn't<00:05:49.170> really<00:05:49.260> go<00:05:49.410> thinking

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
truck it doesn't really go thinking

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.700 
truck it doesn't really go thinking
about<00:05:50.060> okay<00:05:51.060> so<00:05:51.120> you've<00:05:51.450> got<00:05:51.480> one<00:05:51.870> choice<00:05:52.110> you

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
about okay so you've got one choice you

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.290 
about okay so you've got one choice you
had<00:05:52.830> to<00:05:52.950> take<00:05:53.100> any<00:05:53.280> home<00:05:53.520> tonight<00:05:53.850> to<00:05:54.120> live

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
had to take any home tonight to live

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.480 
had to take any home tonight to live
with<00:05:54.510> for<00:05:54.720> the<00:05:54.750> next<00:05:54.810> say<00:05:55.230> three<00:05:55.470> years<00:05:55.650> or<00:05:56.340> to

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
with for the next say three years or to

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.350 
with for the next say three years or to
be<00:05:57.380> it's<00:05:58.380> a<00:05:58.500> tough<00:05:58.680> one<00:05:58.890> but<00:05:59.070> balancing<00:05:59.820> both

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
be it's a tough one but balancing both

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.870 
be it's a tough one but balancing both
the<00:06:00.570> design<00:06:00.960> the<00:06:01.500> feel<00:06:01.770> and<00:06:01.950> the<00:06:02.070> safety<00:06:02.460> out<00:06:02.490> I

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
the design the feel and the safety out I

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.820 
the design the feel and the safety out I
think<00:06:03.450> for<00:06:03.600> me<00:06:03.720> it's<00:06:03.870> probably<00:06:04.320> got<00:06:04.530> to<00:06:04.590> be<00:06:04.680> the

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
think for me it's probably got to be the

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.430 
think for me it's probably got to be the
goal<00:06:05.360> but<00:06:06.360> if<00:06:06.480> you<00:06:06.600> were<00:06:06.720> to<00:06:06.870> be<00:06:06.960> pushed<00:06:07.200> on<00:06:07.350> the

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 
goal but if you were to be pushed on the

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.960 
goal but if you were to be pushed on the
safety<00:06:07.800> front<00:06:07.830> along<00:06:08.280> what<00:06:08.520> would<00:06:08.640> you<00:06:08.730> take

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:08.970 
safety front along what would you take

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.930 
safety front along what would you take
on<00:06:09.840> a<00:06:10.350> safety<00:06:10.800> front<00:06:10.980> I<00:06:11.190> mean<00:06:11.370> the<00:06:11.610> four-wheel

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
on a safety front I mean the four-wheel

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.490 
on a safety front I mean the four-wheel
drive<00:06:11.970> it's<00:06:12.480> just<00:06:12.540> it's<00:06:12.900> so<00:06:13.110> much<00:06:13.140> sturdier

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 
drive it's just it's so much sturdier

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.240 
drive it's just it's so much sturdier
out<00:06:13.830> there

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
out there

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.420 
out there
it'd<00:06:14.550> have<00:06:14.760> to<00:06:14.790> be<00:06:14.910> the<00:06:15.000> Subaru
