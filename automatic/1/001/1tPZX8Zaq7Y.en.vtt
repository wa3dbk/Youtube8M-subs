00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:56.080 
behind you as far as a decorative piece
but<00:01:54.229> a<00:01:54.289> lot<00:01:54.529> of<00:01:54.649> dancers<00:01:55.130> use<00:01:55.549> this<00:01:55.789> during

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
but a lot of dancers use this during

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.959 
but a lot of dancers use this during
their<00:01:56.329> routine<00:01:56.689> you<00:01:57.679> would<00:01:57.770> fold<00:01:58.039> it<00:01:58.369> to<00:01:58.939> make

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
their routine you would fold it to make

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:02.750 
their routine you would fold it to make
it<00:01:59.359> a<00:01:59.599> triangle

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.400 

and<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.420> would<00:02:03.540> use<00:02:03.720> it<00:02:03.870> the<00:02:03.960> same<00:02:04.200> way<00:02:04.380> you

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
and you would use it the same way you

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.110 
and you would use it the same way you
would<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.920> other<00:02:05.070> month<00:02:05.340> on<00:02:05.550> and<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:05.970> course

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
would the other month on and of course

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.490 
would the other month on and of course
you<00:02:06.240> can<00:02:06.360> wear<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.750> as<00:02:06.900> well

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
you can wear it as well

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.190 
you can wear it as well
so<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.430> really<00:02:08.580> depends<00:02:09.060> what<00:02:09.180> size<00:02:09.420> what

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
so it really depends what size what

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.380 
so it really depends what size what
budget<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.740> have<00:02:10.979> this<00:02:11.520> runs<00:02:11.880> about<00:02:12.240> an

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
budget you have this runs about an

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.750 
budget you have this runs about an
average<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:12.900> about<00:02:13.110> $300<00:02:13.950> for<00:02:14.220> a<00:02:14.250> full<00:02:14.520> size

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
average of about $300 for a full size

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.640 
average of about $300 for a full size
and<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.270> can<00:02:15.420> get<00:02:15.540> them<00:02:15.690> as<00:02:15.870> economical<00:02:16.530> as

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
and you can get them as economical as

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.400 
and you can get them as economical as
$20<00:02:17.310> so<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:17.850> really<00:02:18.030> depends<00:02:18.450> how<00:02:19.260> are<00:02:19.320> you

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
$20 so it really depends how are you

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.710 
$20 so it really depends how are you
gonna<00:02:19.530> use<00:02:19.620> it<00:02:19.830> how<00:02:20.490> long<00:02:20.700> your<00:02:20.940> arms<00:02:20.970> are<00:02:21.450> and
