00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
another step would be to try and do at

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.730 
another step would be to try and do at
least<00:01:05.189> 10,000<00:01:05.880> steps<00:01:06.150> per<00:01:06.420> day<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.530> maybe

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
least 10,000 steps per day so maybe

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.469 
least 10,000 steps per day so maybe
carrying<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.280> pedometer<00:01:08.580> with<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.150> stick<00:01:09.360> it

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
carrying a pedometer with you stick it

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.410 
carrying a pedometer with you stick it
on<00:01:09.570> your<00:01:09.600> waist<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.439> go<00:01:11.100> for<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.340> walk<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.939> try

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
on your waist and go for a walk and try

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.380 
on your waist and go for a walk and try
to<00:01:12.540> get<00:01:13.380> at<00:01:13.470> least<00:01:13.500> 10,000<00:01:14.400> steps<00:01:14.610> per<00:01:15.180> day<00:01:15.210> so

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
to get at least 10,000 steps per day so

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.780 
to get at least 10,000 steps per day so
that<00:01:15.720> means<00:01:15.930> about<00:01:16.140> 30<00:01:16.500> steps<00:01:17.009> every<00:01:17.460> 30

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
that means about 30 steps every 30

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.789 
that means about 30 steps every 30
minutes<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.439> a<00:01:19.580> good<00:01:20.580> average<00:01:21.530> so<00:01:22.530> another

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
minutes is a good average so another

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.929 
minutes is a good average so another
thing<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.159> switch<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:24.000> refined<00:01:24.799> carbs<00:01:25.939> so

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
thing is to switch to refined carbs so

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.020 
thing is to switch to refined carbs so
you<00:01:27.000> also<00:01:27.570> want<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.439> reach<00:01:28.920> or<00:01:29.220> eat<00:01:29.610> more<00:01:29.820> of

your energy expenditure needs to be

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.060 
your energy expenditure needs to be
about<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:08.790> same<00:03:09.000> level<00:03:09.209> if<00:03:09.510> not<00:03:09.540> more<00:03:10.350> to<00:03:10.980> be

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
about the same level if not more to be

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.970

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
seven hundred calories or it's thirty

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.500 
seven hundred calories or it's thirty
five<00:03:17.459> hundred<00:03:17.490> or<00:03:17.910> thirty<00:03:18.150> seven<00:03:18.480> hundred

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
five hundred or thirty seven hundred

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.940 
five hundred or thirty seven hundred
calories<00:03:19.350> to<00:03:19.560> burn<00:03:20.090> one<00:03:21.090> pound<00:03:21.360> of<00:03:21.540> fat<00:03:21.950> so
