00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.660
 So, I finished that first one. 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:20.540
 round where I have the half point 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.240
 High and low again I go 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.830
 do the same thing a two chains 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.550
 to go up 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:30.170
 I'm going to work with a high point where 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.769
 in his previous career 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.210
 it was a high point and I'm going to work the 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:38.269
 low point 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.330
 omd to the previous career was a point 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:45.200
 down is exactly the same without making 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:49.730
 Come on, look, it's fine. 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:54.680
 here is the base of our and cliper 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:58.219
 from our my of our slipper or 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.829
 Whatever you want to call the 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:03.320
 So, you stay there anyway, you're done with this. 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.970
 About Me 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.320
 Look, I 'm not walking here. 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.550
 city ​​right 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:13.399
 I'm going to pull it here, here how much 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.099
 he stretches it anyway 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:18.979
 That's why there's no need for you. 

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:21.470
 work the amount of points until 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.110
 cover the entire foot because the intention is 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:28.660
 stay on your foot and not that 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:31.700
 be exactly a measure but rather a 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:34.009
 material that has an elasticity up to 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:39.229
 Look here, you see. 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:42.590
 Normal is normal, and it's pulling, see. 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:46.429
 So, do we want something that has a 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:49.220
 perfect fit ne shoes set 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:53.989
 fits well this smallness're going 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:57.050
 adjust from 33 to 36 

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:58.700
 Okay, okay look at continuing the people. 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.520
 Are you going to have to do the following? 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:05.270
 change stuff I'm leaving the lan lan 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:08.060
 and I'm going to use a little car just 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.429
 line is actually a detail 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.020
 It's good, it would not even have to be done with 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:17.180
 mine if you want to continue is with wool 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.340
 It's still a problem, it's not just me. 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.860
 I like to give a variety I like to put 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.420
 a detail here another there then I 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.000
 I cut here 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.520
 and I gave my 90 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.860
 super securely okay let's change 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:34.470
 the material then takes your there skein 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.470
 line for us to be able to continue
