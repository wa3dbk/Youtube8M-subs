this is a quick tutorial on me teaching
you<00:00:11.580> how<00:00:11.820> to<00:00:11.880> make<00:00:12.090> loans<00:00:12.420> of<00:00:12.600> yourself<00:00:17.509> now

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:18.509 
you how to make loans of yourself now

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:21.829 
you how to make loans of yourself now
this<00:00:18.900> isn't<00:00:19.230> actually<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:20.460> way<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.509> make

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:21.839 
this isn't actually a way to make

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:23.779 
this isn't actually a way to make
physical<00:00:22.169> plums<00:00:22.679> of<00:00:22.890> yourself<00:00:23.279> I<00:00:23.460> don't<00:00:23.669> even

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
physical plums of yourself I don't even

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.730 
physical plums of yourself I don't even
know<00:00:23.999> if<00:00:24.089> that's<00:00:24.269> been<00:00:24.509> invented<00:00:25.079> yet<00:00:25.109> or<00:00:25.560> if

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
know if that's been invented yet or if

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.159 
know if that's been invented yet or if
it<00:00:25.859> ever<00:00:26.099> will<00:00:26.460> be<00:00:26.699> invented<00:00:27.179> this<00:00:27.960> is

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:28.169 
it ever will be invented this is

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:30.739 
it ever will be invented this is
actually<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.679> video<00:00:29.009> trick<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:30.269> makes<00:00:30.539> it

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:30.749 
actually a video trick that makes it

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:32.630 
actually a video trick that makes it
seem<00:00:31.199> like<00:00:31.499> there<00:00:31.769> are<00:00:31.859> clones<00:00:32.100> of<00:00:32.279> yourself

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
seem like there are clones of yourself

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.420 
seem like there are clones of yourself
it's<00:00:32.880> very<00:00:33.300> easy<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.630> do<00:00:33.900> and<00:00:34.160> right<00:00:35.160> now<00:00:35.340> I'm

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
it's very easy to do and right now I'm

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.400 
it's very easy to do and right now I'm
going<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.760> go<00:00:35.880> over<00:00:35.910> how<00:00:36.150> to<00:00:36.180> do<00:00:36.450> this<00:00:36.600> first

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
going to go over how to do this first

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.230 
going to go over how to do this first
off<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:37.920> need<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.130> film<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.550> in<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.790> specific

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:39.240 
off you need to film it in the specific

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.300 
off you need to film it in the specific
way<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.840> have<00:00:39.990> room<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.470> make<00:00:40.800> clones<00:00:41.130> of

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.310 
way that you have room to make clones of

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.750 
way that you have room to make clones of
yourself<00:00:41.700> now<00:00:42.600> truly<00:00:43.230> all<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:43.830> is<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.460> you're

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
yourself now truly all this is is you're

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.940 
yourself now truly all this is is you're
not<00:00:44.910> actually<00:00:45.320> copying<00:00:46.320> yourself<00:00:46.770> or

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
not actually copying yourself or

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.730 
not actually copying yourself or
anything<00:00:47.100> you're<00:00:47.490> just<00:00:47.720> acting<00:00:48.720> in<00:00:49.170> one<00:00:49.410> half

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:49.740 
anything you're just acting in one half

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.970 
anything you're just acting in one half
of<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.950> clip<00:00:50.220> like<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.530> then<00:00:52.530> you're

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
of the clip like this and then you're

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.770 
of the clip like this and then you're
moving<00:00:53.310> to<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.580> other<00:00:53.730> half<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.330> clip<00:00:54.570> and

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
moving to the other half of the clip and

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.750 
moving to the other half of the clip and
acting<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:55.830> and<00:00:56.370> then<00:00:56.610> you're<00:00:56.730> just

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
acting in that and then you're just

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.240 
acting in that and then you're just
putting<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.690> two<00:00:57.840> together<00:00:58.020> propping<00:00:58.770> the

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
putting the two together propping the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.250 
putting the two together propping the
top<00:00:59.490> one<00:00:59.700> in<00:00:59.850> half<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.330> it<00:01:00.450> looks<00:01:00.810> like<00:01:01.020> one

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
top one in half and it looks like one

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.189 
top one in half and it looks like one
full<00:01:01.500> clip<00:01:01.770> with<00:01:02.400> two<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.850> your<00:01:03.060> self<00:01:03.690> or<00:01:03.930> as

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
full clip with two of your self or as

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.279 
full clip with two of your self or as
many<00:01:04.589> as<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.829> can<00:01:04.949> fit<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.249> there<00:01:05.399> I<00:01:05.429> guess

00:01:06.279 --> 00:01:06.289 
many as you can fit in there I guess

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:09.770 
many as you can fit in there I guess
it's<00:01:07.289> really<00:01:07.700> just<00:01:08.700> propping<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.570> clip

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
it's really just propping the clip

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.810 
it's really just propping the clip
that's<00:01:10.170> really<00:01:10.679> all<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.159> that's<00:01:11.460> why<00:01:11.640> it's

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
that's really all it is that's why it's

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.120 
that's really all it is that's why it's
so<00:01:11.880> easy<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.240> do<00:01:12.479> but<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.079> results<00:01:13.560> can<00:01:13.950> be

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
so easy to do but the results can be

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.669 
so easy to do but the results can be
very<00:01:16.490> cool<00:01:17.490> i<00:01:17.729> guess<00:01:17.789> i<00:01:18.179> don't<00:01:18.450> know<00:01:18.590> there's<00:01:19.590> a

00:01:19.669 --> 00:01:19.679 
very cool i guess i don't know there's a

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:20.870 
very cool i guess i don't know there's a
lot<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.859> things<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.249> can<00:01:20.399> do<00:01:20.520> with<00:01:20.640> this

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
lot of things you can do with this

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.719 
lot of things you can do with this
cloning<00:01:21.329> technique<00:01:21.840> thing<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.920> first<00:01:23.579> i'm

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
cloning technique thing so first i'm

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.639 
cloning technique thing so first i'm
going<00:01:23.819> to<00:01:23.909> show<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.390> few<00:01:24.719> example<00:01:25.259> first

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
going to show you a few example first

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:27.950 
going to show you a few example first
one<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.159> clones<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.909> one<00:01:26.969> this<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.659> video<00:01:27.810> i

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
one is clones of one this is the video i

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.319 
one is clones of one this is the video i
did<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.439> while<00:01:29.130> back<00:01:30.350> in<00:01:31.350> this<00:01:32.069> video<00:01:32.310> i<00:01:32.700> did<00:01:33.179> a

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
did a while back in this video i did a

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.359 
did a while back in this video i did a
little<00:01:33.659> bit<00:01:33.869> more<00:01:34.079> advanced<00:01:34.409> stuff<00:01:34.679> we

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
little bit more advanced stuff we

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.069 
little bit more advanced stuff we
actually<00:01:35.700> had<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:35.969> leave<00:01:36.119> enough<00:01:36.389> room<00:01:36.509> in<00:01:36.840> the

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
actually had to leave enough room in the

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.660 
actually had to leave enough room in the
clip<00:01:37.289> so<00:01:37.560> we<00:01:37.679> could<00:01:37.829> crop<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.490> make<00:01:38.639> it

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
clip so we could crop it and make it

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.270 
clip so we could crop it and make it
look<00:01:38.939> like<00:01:39.179> it<00:01:39.929> was<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.200> same<00:01:40.380> clip<00:01:40.740> which

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
look like it was the same clip which

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.090 
look like it was the same clip which
became<00:01:41.639> difficult<00:01:41.969> at<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.479> point<00:01:42.749> when<00:01:43.439> my

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
became difficult at the point when my

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.459 
became difficult at the point when my
brother<00:01:44.759> was<00:01:44.880> cloned<00:01:45.450> running<00:01:45.959> across<00:01:46.170> the

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:46.469 
brother was cloned running across the

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:49.429 
brother was cloned running across the
screen<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.039> actually<00:01:47.939> due<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.389> a<00:01:48.439> special

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
screen and actually due to a special

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.819 
screen and actually due to a special
animation<00:01:50.159> technique<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.969> my<00:01:51.590> software<00:01:52.590> i

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
animation technique and my software i

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.889 
animation technique and my software i
was<00:01:53.249> able<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.490> keep<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.939> crop<00:01:54.179> going<00:01:54.569> as<00:01:54.719> he

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
was able to keep the crop going as he

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.959 
was able to keep the crop going as he
ran<00:01:55.200> but<00:01:55.979> in<00:01:56.100> case<00:01:56.279> you<00:01:56.340> have<00:01:56.520> noticed<00:01:56.850> the

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
ran but in case you have noticed the

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.620 
ran but in case you have noticed the
trees<00:01:57.240> kind<00:01:57.479> of<00:01:58.340> liquor<00:01:59.340> i<00:01:59.459> guess<00:01:59.759> as<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.179> crop

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
trees kind of liquor i guess as the crop

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.190 
trees kind of liquor i guess as the crop

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
is moving my second example is a

to do was place the camera in a set spot
and<00:02:13.599> then<00:02:14.700> just<00:02:15.700> record<00:02:16.660> half<00:02:17.069> half<00:02:18.069> of<00:02:18.220> the

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
and then just record half half of the

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.580 
and then just record half half of the
video<00:02:18.580> of<00:02:18.849> me<00:02:18.910> standing<00:02:19.660> in<00:02:19.870> one<00:02:19.959> spot<00:02:19.989> saying

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
do the other half of the video ask for

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.309 
do the other half of the video ask for
the<00:02:27.190> editing<00:02:27.670> portion<00:02:28.090> of<00:02:28.209> this<00:02:28.330> video<00:02:28.660> it's

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
the editing portion of this video it's

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.990 
the editing portion of this video it's
very<00:02:29.709> simple<00:02:30.040> all<00:02:30.280> you<00:02:30.340> have<00:02:30.489> to<00:02:30.610> do<00:02:30.730> is<00:02:30.849> make

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
very simple all you have to do is make

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.759 
very simple all you have to do is make
sure<00:02:31.030> that<00:02:31.420> you've<00:02:31.599> got<00:02:31.630> it<00:02:31.900> filmed<00:02:32.290> correctly

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
sure that you've got it filmed correctly

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.619 
sure that you've got it filmed correctly
the<00:02:32.890> first<00:02:32.920> time<00:02:33.370> it<00:02:33.819> typically<00:02:34.120> helps<00:02:34.360> if<00:02:34.510> you

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
the first time it typically helps if you

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:35.789 
the first time it typically helps if you
have<00:02:34.750> a<00:02:34.780> script<00:02:35.110> especially<00:02:35.620> if<00:02:35.680> you're

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
have a script especially if you're

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:37.830 
have a script especially if you're
talking<00:02:36.099> while<00:02:36.489> you're<00:02:36.670> being<00:02:36.790> cloned<00:02:37.209> that

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
talking while you're being cloned that

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.500 
talking while you're being cloned that
way<00:02:38.019> you<00:02:38.080> don't<00:02:38.459> get<00:02:39.459> your<00:02:39.610> lines<00:02:39.819> all<00:02:40.120> jumbled

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
way you don't get your lines all jumbled

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.180 
way you don't get your lines all jumbled
up<00:02:40.569> and<00:02:40.810> you<00:02:41.019> it'll<00:02:41.440> be<00:02:41.530> easier<00:02:41.860> for<00:02:41.890> you<00:02:42.130> to

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
up and you it'll be easier for you to

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.050 
up and you it'll be easier for you to
time<00:02:42.549> it<00:02:42.760> and<00:02:42.910> crop<00:02:43.180> it<00:02:43.650> so<00:02:44.670> let's<00:02:45.670> go<00:02:45.819> to<00:02:45.880> the

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
time it and crop it so let's go to the

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.940 
time it and crop it so let's go to the
editing<00:02:46.450> so<00:02:47.079> it's<00:02:47.200> just<00:02:47.290> start<00:02:47.620> on<00:02:47.829> the

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
editing so it's just start on the

editing so it's just start on the
editing<00:02:48.430> you<00:02:48.640> just<00:02:48.849> go<00:02:49.150> and<00:02:49.360> open<00:02:49.569> up<00:02:49.840> your

editing you just go and open up your
editing<00:02:50.500> software<00:02:51.069> for<00:02:51.910> me<00:02:52.060> it's<00:02:52.360> Doby

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
editing software for me it's Doby

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
whenever I changed the next part of it

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.650 
whenever I changed the next part of it
starts<00:03:17.799> up<00:03:17.920> what<00:03:18.790> I've<00:03:18.910> got<00:03:19.090> to<00:03:19.120> do<00:03:19.329> is<00:03:19.420> I<00:03:19.510> got

to bring this clip over place it on the

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:27.270 
to bring this clip over place it on the
top<00:03:21.910> of<00:03:23.280> my<00:03:24.280> first<00:03:24.670> clip<00:03:25.530> now<00:03:26.530> see<00:03:26.799> you<00:03:26.980> can't

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
top of my first clip now see you can't

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.759 
top of my first clip now see you can't
see<00:03:27.670> one<00:03:28.090> or<00:03:28.389> the<00:03:28.569> other<00:03:28.600> until<00:03:28.989> I've<00:03:29.350> dropped

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
see one or the other until I've dropped

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.039 
see one or the other until I've dropped
it<00:03:30.069> it's<00:03:30.970> what<00:03:31.180> I'm<00:03:31.269> about<00:03:31.389> to<00:03:31.480> show<00:03:31.780> you<00:03:31.810> how

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
it it's what I'm about to show you how

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.430 
it it's what I'm about to show you how
to<00:03:32.109> do<00:03:32.319> now<00:03:32.799> and<00:03:33.450> some<00:03:34.450> softwares<00:03:34.959> have<00:03:35.200> this

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
to do now and some softwares have this

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.340 
to do now and some softwares have this
tool<00:03:35.680> others<00:03:36.280> don't<00:03:36.690> it<00:03:37.690> just<00:03:37.959> depends<00:03:38.290> on

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
tool others don't it just depends on

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.110 
tool others don't it just depends on
your<00:03:38.500> software<00:03:39.040> if<00:03:39.220> you<00:03:39.400> don't<00:03:39.609> have<00:03:39.819> it<00:03:39.970> then

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
your software if you don't have it then

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.229 
your software if you don't have it then
this<00:03:40.299> will<00:03:40.480> not<00:03:40.690> work<00:03:41.370> drop<00:03:42.370> it<00:03:42.549> off<00:03:42.730> the<00:03:42.940> bike

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
this will not work drop it off the bike

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.370 
this will not work drop it off the bike
and<00:03:44.340> now<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:45.910> trick<00:03:46.150> is<00:03:46.180> to<00:03:46.329> sync<00:03:46.840> it<00:03:46.930> up<00:03:47.079> so

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
and now the trick is to sync it up so

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.680 
and now the trick is to sync it up so
that<00:03:47.500> it<00:03:47.650> seems<00:03:47.950> like<00:03:48.220> it's<00:03:48.450> actually<00:03:49.450> one

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
that it seems like it's actually one

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.570 
that it seems like it's actually one
clip<00:03:50.400> which<00:03:51.400> is<00:03:51.549> mostly<00:03:51.880> just<00:03:52.150> practice

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
clip which is mostly just practice

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:59.180 
clip which is mostly just practice
threes<00:03:55.130> see<00:03:56.130> here<00:03:57.290> this<00:03:58.290> is<00:03:58.350> an<00:03:58.650> example<00:03:58.950> of

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
threes see here this is an example of

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.800 
threes see here this is an example of
what<00:03:59.400> it<00:03:59.490> looks<00:03:59.700> like<00:03:59.850> whenever<00:04:00.120> your<00:04:00.510> crop

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
what it looks like whenever your crop

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.060 
what it looks like whenever your crop
gets<00:04:01.110> in<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:01.380> way<00:04:01.530> of<00:04:01.560> your<00:04:01.710> clip<00:04:03.920> you<00:04:04.920> might
