00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
this racetrack to see how far we can run

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.150 
this racetrack to see how far we can run
to<00:02:09.550> look<00:02:09.670> around<00:02:09.959> let's<00:02:10.959> try<00:02:11.200> this<00:02:11.260> about

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
to look around let's try this about

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.680 
to look around let's try this about
three<00:02:12.459> two<00:02:12.910> one<00:02:13.060> let's<00:02:13.209> go<00:02:13.270> we<00:02:13.480> have<00:02:13.510> to<00:02:13.600> go

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
three two one let's go we have to go

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.290 
three two one let's go we have to go
through<00:02:13.959> every<00:02:14.290> single<00:02:14.320> hoop<00:02:14.880> but<00:02:15.880> then

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
through every single hoop but then

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:43.530 
through every single hoop but then
there's<00:02:27.270> no<00:02:40.530> we<00:02:41.530> made<00:02:41.709> it<00:02:41.970> that<00:02:42.970> was<00:02:43.090> actually

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
there's no we made it that was actually

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.530 
there's no we made it that was actually
pretty<00:02:43.720> fast<00:02:44.020> and<00:02:47.400> let's<00:02:48.400> do<00:02:48.580> the<00:02:49.150> hoverboard

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
pretty fast and let's do the hoverboard

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.840 
pretty fast and let's do the hoverboard
