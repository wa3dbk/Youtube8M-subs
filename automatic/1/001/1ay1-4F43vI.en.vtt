00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.730
 paquita del barrio 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.730
 It was inspired by God 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.780
 with a song that says rat of two 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.780
 legs 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:36.010
 I was not talking about all the men 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:38.559
 do not take it wrong the song was 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.100
 speaking to those men who do not 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:41.100
 tithe 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.990
 I was talking about those two rats 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.690
 legs 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.490
 but because he knows that god is not 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.630
 interested in your money he is 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:57.880
 interested in you that your heart but 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:01.930
 to have our heart he has to 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:04.860
 have this he has to have our 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.860
 money 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.990
 it is very possible to say goodbye 10% but not 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.619
 give him 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.619
 the tithe 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:20.420
 because it has to be the first 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.869
 because it is a matter of faith 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:28.460
 or if I pay everything and I have no god 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:31.070
 take it is serious faith on my part no no it 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:34.189
 He required faith for nothing but if I give you 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.229
 the first without knowing what I 'm going to have 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.690
 to pay without knowing if it will reach me 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.930
 I tell him God first you are the Lord 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.090
 of my life there is and now I have to 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.180
 live by faith I have to live 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.149
 trusting that God is going to bless me 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.270
 God will meet my needs us 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:56.000
 says Hebrews 11 6 that without faith is 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.740
 impossible to please God because it is 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.789
 necessary that the one who approaches God 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.710
 believe that he exists and that is that 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:05.780
 remunerative of what you are looking for that 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.670
 the tithe has to be first because 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.729
 I am going to walk in faith and I am going to believe 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.340
 in a god that is good that is going to 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.880
 blessing economically I will believe 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:20.060
 in a god that is powerful that can 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:23.690
 meet all my needs 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:27.090
 I'm going to walk by faith in that great god 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:30.709
 and that good god 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:34.360
 we do not have a monterrey god 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:37.360
 forgive me those who come from monterrey 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.270
 but no no no we do not have a stingy god 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.970
 petty if we do not have a generous God 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:47.280
 but he wants to see that you saw how 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.280
 children of God let's walk by 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.590
 another thing that makes God give first 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:59.280
 is that he blesses everything else if I give 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.320
 all this to my expenses to the commission of 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.970
 electricity and everything and I give god what 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.810
 last and I'm left with nothing in my hand 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.750
 god who can bless 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.240
 God's blessing over zero is the same 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.120
 to 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.400
 but if I give God the first thing and I 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.620
 all this is in your hand then 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:22.300
 God's blessing comes on this 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:26.140
 listen to me Romans 11 16 and if the first 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:29.190
 piece of the dough the first piece is 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:35.680
 holy sanctified it by giving it to god 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:40.000
 so is the whole mass and if the root 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.950
 it is holy also the branches are but 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.660
 listen to me if this I go first to the 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.490
 federal electricity commission 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:50.900
 they can bless me the rest 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:54.230
 if I give it to buy some shoes for 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:59.700
 the shoemaker can bless me the rest 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:02.340
 he can not only god when you and I 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.010
 we take the first part of the mass the 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.160
 we sanctify giving him goodbye says that everything 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.950
 the rest is sanctified everything else is 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:14.780
 blessed everything else has the grace 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.780
 and God's favor over 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:21.489
 god when he asked abraham 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:25.090
 to sacrifice to his son which son was 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:27.250
 the first one in the first one did not tell 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.650
 see then there was chilpayates and bring me 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:34.330
 the most naughty one that you can not stand and that 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:37.690
 we sacrificed them did not tell him which 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:42.900
 first the first you and I have to 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.900
 make goodbye first in our lives
