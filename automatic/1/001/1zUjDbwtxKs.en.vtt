so<00:00:32.970> it<00:00:33.970> should<00:00:34.210> work<00:00:34.450> out

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:50.340 

this<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.289> a<00:00:40.320> desperation<00:00:41.280> so

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.510 

this<00:00:50.530> brilliant<00:00:51.010> a<00:00:51.100> new<00:00:51.310> game

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.799 

and<00:00:55.820> break<00:00:56.120> up<00:00:56.300> the<00:00:56.330> two<00:00:56.570> soil

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.549 

I<00:00:59.840> have<00:01:00.530> to<00:01:00.680> do<00:01:00.829> this<00:01:00.980> with

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
I have to do this with

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.039 
I have to do this with
both<00:01:03.129> of<00:01:03.370> my<00:01:03.640> TV

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
both of my TV

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:08.760 
both of my TV
we<00:01:05.500> enter<00:01:06.180> button<00:01:07.180> and<00:01:07.540> the<00:01:07.659> tilde<00:01:08.439> button

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
found set to the proper function check

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.770 
found set to the proper function check
so<00:01:13.000> I<00:01:13.240> have<00:01:13.720> to<00:01:13.840> do<00:01:13.960> it<00:01:14.110> by<00:01:14.830> hand<00:01:15.360> on<00:01:16.360> a<00:01:16.420> piece<00:01:16.570> B

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.310 

there's<00:02:19.560> no<00:02:19.710> delay<00:02:20.450> at<00:02:21.450> least<00:02:21.630> I<00:02:21.720> haven't<00:02:21.930> lost

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:31.150 
there's no delay at least I haven't lost
a<00:02:22.560> delay<00:02:23.040> yet<00:02:26.330> it<00:02:27.330> works<00:02:27.540> all<00:02:27.720> very<00:02:28.110> fluently

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:43.860 

as<00:02:32.160> you<00:02:32.370> can<00:02:32.520> see

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.229 

I'm<00:02:44.870> really<00:02:45.079> amazed<00:02:45.379> how<00:02:45.680> good<00:02:46.310> this<00:02:46.969> thing

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.709 
I'm really amazed how good this thing
works<00:02:48.129> because<00:02:49.129> it's<00:02:49.430> it's<00:02:50.000> almost<00:02:50.269> fused

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:50.719 
works because it's it's almost fused

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:54.099 
works because it's it's almost fused
like<00:02:51.439> you're<00:02:51.590> playing<00:02:51.829> it<00:02:51.980> on<00:02:52.099> the<00:02:52.189> PCs<00:02:53.019> but<00:02:54.019> of

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:54.109 
like you're playing it on the PCs but of

00:02:54.109 --> 00:03:07.410 
like you're playing it on the PCs but of

you can move really well this is way
better<00:03:24.490> than<00:03:24.670> playing<00:03:25.060> with<00:03:25.180> a<00:03:25.530> normal

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530
