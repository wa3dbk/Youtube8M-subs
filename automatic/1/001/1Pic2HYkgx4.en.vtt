mentioned in my review of a moveable
feast<00:00:09.000> that<00:00:09.269> I'm<00:00:09.420> not<00:00:09.570> a<00:00:09.599> huge<00:00:10.019> Hemingway<00:00:10.590> fan

feast that I'm not a huge Hemingway fan

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.370 
feast that I'm not a huge Hemingway fan
I<00:00:11.190> read<00:00:11.700> a<00:00:12.000> farewell<00:00:12.389> to<00:00:12.540> arms<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.929> couple<00:00:13.170> years

I read a farewell to arms a couple years

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.230 
I read a farewell to arms a couple years
ago<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:13.860> really<00:00:14.190> really<00:00:14.429> hated<00:00:14.700> it<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.150> it

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
ago and really really hated it and it

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.420 
ago and really really hated it and it
put<00:00:15.450> me<00:00:15.480> off<00:00:15.750> Hemingway<00:00:16.289> but<00:00:16.890> then<00:00:17.070> I<00:00:17.220> read<00:00:17.369> a

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
put me off Hemingway but then I read a

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.609 
put me off Hemingway but then I read a
moveable<00:00:17.880> feast<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.420> I<00:00:18.480> absolutely<00:00:18.960> loved<00:00:19.439> it

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
moveable feast and I absolutely loved it

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.679 
moveable feast and I absolutely loved it
so<00:00:19.949> I<00:00:20.220> thought<00:00:20.670> it<00:00:20.789> was<00:00:20.880> time<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.240> finally<00:00:21.570> get

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
so I thought it was time to finally get

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.150 
so I thought it was time to finally get
around<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:22.109> reading<00:00:22.230> The<00:00:22.470> Sun<00:00:22.740> Also<00:00:22.769> Rises

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
for years now the Sun Also Rises a

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.779 
for years now the Sun Also Rises a
semi-autobiographical<00:00:28.680> which<00:00:29.400> makes<00:00:29.640> me

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
semi-autobiographical which makes me

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.490 
semi-autobiographical which makes me
feel<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.000> little<00:00:30.269> bit<00:00:30.480> less<00:00:30.720> bad<00:00:30.990> for<00:00:31.019> how<00:00:31.470> I

feel a little bit less bad for how I

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.889 
feel a little bit less bad for how I
kept<00:00:31.949> thinking<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.759> main<00:00:33.120> character<00:00:33.690> as

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
kept thinking of the main character as

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.440 
kept thinking of the main character as

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
half of the book is really just a set up

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.000 
half of the book is really just a set up
of<00:00:45.210> all<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.390> their<00:00:45.660> relationships<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.739> then

falls<00:00:50.100> apart<00:00:50.460> there<00:00:50.730> after<00:00:51.239> reading<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.629> book

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809

falls apart there after reading the book
I<00:00:51.960> read<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.260> Wikipedia<00:00:52.469> synopsis<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.760> Sun

I read the Wikipedia synopsis of the Sun

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.180 
I read the Wikipedia synopsis of the Sun
Also<00:00:54.329> Rises<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:55.020> while<00:00:55.230> everything<00:00:55.860> that

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
Also Rises and while everything that

Also Rises and while everything that
they<00:00:56.309> list<00:00:56.610> really<00:00:57.000> does<00:00:57.390> happen<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.530> way<00:00:58.680> it

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
they list really does happen the way it

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.610 
they list really does happen the way it
happens<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.520> book<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:00.120> subtle<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:01.469> it

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
happens in the book is so subtle that it

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.979 
happens in the book is so subtle that it
doesn't<00:01:01.980> sound<00:01:02.129> half<00:01:02.489> as<00:01:02.699> sensational<00:01:03.420> as<00:01:03.629> any

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
doesn't sound half as sensational as any

doesn't sound half as sensational as any
synopsis<00:01:04.830> or<00:01:04.979> description<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.640> what<00:01:05.820> happened

synopsis or description of what happened

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.090 
synopsis or description of what happened
would<00:01:06.360> in<00:01:06.630> true<00:01:06.960> Hemingway<00:01:07.380> fashion<00:01:07.860> there's

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
would in true Hemingway fashion there's

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.039 
would in true Hemingway fashion there's
a<00:01:08.159> lot<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.490> really<00:01:08.880> really<00:01:09.090> beautiful<00:01:09.780> lines

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
a lot of really really beautiful lines

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.859 
a lot of really really beautiful lines
and<00:01:10.500> there's<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.920> lot<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.490> missing<00:01:12.090> description

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
and there's a lot of missing description

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.230 
and there's a lot of missing description
where<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:14.100> know<00:01:14.220> he<00:01:14.400> might<00:01:14.520> just<00:01:14.760> describe

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
where you know he might just describe

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.149 
where you know he might just describe
something<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:16.200> would<00:01:16.380> think<00:01:16.560> would<00:01:16.740> be<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.890> big

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
something you would think would be a big

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.240 
something you would think would be a big
deal<00:01:17.340> it's<00:01:17.729> nice<00:01:18.119> or<00:01:18.659> Pleasant<00:01:19.170> which<00:01:19.979> gives

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
deal it's nice or Pleasant which gives

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.160 
deal it's nice or Pleasant which gives
you<00:01:20.400> almost<00:01:20.640> no<00:01:21.000> information<00:01:21.299> at<00:01:21.720> all<00:01:21.840> there's

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
you almost no information at all there's

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.440 
you almost no information at all there's
a<00:01:22.229> lot<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.560> dialogue<00:01:22.770> with<00:01:23.220> zero<00:01:23.759> action

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
a lot of dialogue with zero action

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.420 
a lot of dialogue with zero action
around<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:25.140> you're<00:01:25.860> never<00:01:26.130> really<00:01:26.220> sure

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
around it so you're never really sure

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.880 
around it so you're never really sure
what's<00:01:27.390> happening<00:01:27.930> or<00:01:28.080> maybe<00:01:28.259> who's<00:01:28.500> speaking

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
what's happening or maybe who's speaking

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.580 
what's happening or maybe who's speaking
and<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.759> doesn't<00:01:30.090> necessarily<00:01:30.210> bother<00:01:31.110> me<00:01:31.409> in

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
and it doesn't necessarily bother me in

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.830 
and it doesn't necessarily bother me in
fact<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:31.890> really<00:01:32.040> love<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.610> dialogue<00:01:33.119> but<00:01:33.509> I

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
fact I really love the dialogue but I

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.010 
fact I really love the dialogue but I
yeah<00:01:34.799> it's<00:01:35.520> certainly<00:01:35.850> Hemingway<00:01:36.750> the

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
yeah it's certainly Hemingway the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.660 
yeah it's certainly Hemingway the
standout<00:01:37.560> thing<00:01:37.740> about<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.130> Sun<00:01:38.340> Also<00:01:38.640> Rises

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
standout thing about the Sun Also Rises

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.660 
standout thing about the Sun Also Rises
is<00:01:39.329> definitely<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.020> characters<00:01:40.590> all<00:01:41.250> of

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
is definitely the characters all of

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.539 
is definitely the characters all of
which<00:01:41.880> are<00:01:42.210> not<00:01:42.509> likable<00:01:43.380> but<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:44.220> are

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
which are not likable but that are

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.550 
which are not likable but that are
interesting<00:01:45.329> it's<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:45.780> strange<00:01:46.079> because

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
interesting it's so strange because

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.520 
interesting it's so strange because
everything<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:47.670> very<00:01:47.700> subtle<00:01:48.509> there's<00:01:49.229> much

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
everything is very subtle there's much

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.679 
everything is very subtle there's much
more<00:01:49.829> talk<00:01:50.159> about<00:01:50.520> everything<00:01:50.880> they<00:01:51.210> eat<00:01:51.479> and

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
more talk about everything they eat and

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.719 
more talk about everything they eat and
drink<00:01:51.780> in<00:01:52.200> man<00:01:52.649> do<00:01:52.829> they<00:01:52.950> drink<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.280> lot<00:01:53.310> they

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
drink in man do they drink a lot they

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.660 
drink in man do they drink a lot they
drink<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:54.540> much<00:01:54.990> wine<00:01:55.619> there's<00:01:56.159> almost<00:01:56.340> zero

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
drink so much wine there's almost zero

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.630 
drink so much wine there's almost zero
scenes<00:01:57.420> in<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.840> entire<00:01:58.229> novel<00:01:58.619> where<00:01:59.490> they're

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
scenes in the entire novel where they're

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.789 
scenes in the entire novel where they're
not<00:01:59.880> drinking<00:02:00.299> something<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.380> usually<00:02:01.530> it's

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
not drinking something and usually it's

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.770 
not drinking something and usually it's
wine<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.250> totally<00:02:02.729> got<00:02:02.880> off<00:02:03.090> track<00:02:03.450> in<00:02:03.659> that

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
wine I totally got off track in that

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.450 
wine I totally got off track in that
whole<00:02:04.020> wine<00:02:04.290> tangent<00:02:04.920> but<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.100> think<00:02:05.310> what<00:02:05.430> I

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
whole wine tangent but I think what I

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.550 
whole wine tangent but I think what I
was<00:02:05.700> saying<00:02:05.969> is<00:02:06.210> that<00:02:06.240> it's<00:02:06.600> very<00:02:06.630> subtle<00:02:07.350> but

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
was saying is that it's very subtle but

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.040 
was saying is that it's very subtle but
the<00:02:08.069> actions<00:02:08.610> of<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.910> characters<00:02:09.119> suggests

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
the actions of the characters suggests

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.200 
the actions of the characters suggests
that<00:02:10.229> there<00:02:10.440> is<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.619> lot<00:02:10.920> more<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.610> their<00:02:11.970> a

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
that there is a lot more to their a

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.080 
that there is a lot more to their a
motions<00:02:12.630> then<00:02:12.990> eyes<00:02:13.250> and<00:02:14.250> it's<00:02:14.940> very

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
motions then eyes and it's very

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.060 
motions then eyes and it's very
interesting<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.690> love<00:02:15.930> story<00:02:16.350> itself<00:02:16.830> is

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
interesting the love story itself is

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.190 
interesting the love story itself is
very<00:02:17.310> settled<00:02:17.700> so<00:02:17.970> settle<00:02:18.330> it<00:02:18.480> at<00:02:18.600> some<00:02:18.810> points

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
very settled so settle it at some points

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.050 
very settled so settle it at some points
I<00:02:19.380> wasn't<00:02:20.130> even<00:02:20.280> really<00:02:20.550> sure<00:02:20.580> how<00:02:21.000> the

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
I wasn't even really sure how the

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.690 
I wasn't even really sure how the
characters<00:02:21.600> felt<00:02:22.170> about<00:02:22.620> each<00:02:22.890> other<00:02:23.130> but<00:02:23.550> it

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
characters felt about each other but it

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.030 
characters felt about each other but it
pays<00:02:23.850> off<00:02:24.060> in<00:02:24.120> a<00:02:24.360> way<00:02:24.480> that<00:02:24.750> is<00:02:24.900> very

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
pays off in a way that is very

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.950 
pays off in a way that is very
satisfying<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.430> yeah<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.270> whole<00:02:27.450> ending

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
satisfying and yeah the whole ending

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.900 
satisfying and yeah the whole ending
really<00:02:28.170> brings<00:02:28.560> everything<00:02:28.920> together<00:02:29.400> for<00:02:29.850> me

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
really brings everything together for me

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.210 
really brings everything together for me
the<00:02:30.600> last<00:02:30.810> line<00:02:31.140> of<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.350> book<00:02:31.590> which<00:02:31.860> is<00:02:31.890> not

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
the last line of the book which is not

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.820 
the last line of the book which is not
really<00:02:32.580> a<00:02:32.610> spoiler<00:02:32.970> is<00:02:33.420> isn't<00:02:34.260> it<00:02:34.320> pretty<00:02:34.530> to

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
really a spoiler is isn't it pretty to

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.370 
really a spoiler is isn't it pretty to
think<00:02:34.860> so<00:02:35.160> which<00:02:35.610> I<00:02:35.850> previously<00:02:36.180> did<00:02:36.750> not<00:02:36.780> know

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
think so which I previously did not know

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.710 
think so which I previously did not know
was<00:02:38.340> an<00:02:38.460> allusion<00:02:38.850> to<00:02:38.880> Hemingway<00:02:39.270> I've<00:02:39.510> heard

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
was an allusion to Hemingway I've heard

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.010 
was an allusion to Hemingway I've heard
that<00:02:39.870> line<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.500> title<00:02:40.980> of<00:02:41.160> a<00:02:41.280> new<00:02:41.610> book<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.210> I

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
that line the title of a new book and I

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.630 
that line the title of a new book and I
didn't<00:02:43.350> know<00:02:43.440> that<00:02:43.620> was<00:02:43.710> a<00:02:43.740> Hemingway<00:02:44.130> line<00:02:44.400> at

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
didn't know that was a Hemingway line at

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.430 
didn't know that was a Hemingway line at
all<00:02:44.820> for<00:02:45.180> all<00:02:45.210> the<00:02:45.450> truly<00:02:45.690> beautiful<00:02:46.230> lines

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
all for all the truly beautiful lines

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.770 
all for all the truly beautiful lines
and<00:02:46.770> the<00:02:46.830> Sun<00:02:47.040> Also<00:02:47.400> Rises<00:02:47.430> it<00:02:48.120> also<00:02:48.270> has<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.510> lot

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
and the Sun Also Rises it also has a lot

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.620 
and the Sun Also Rises it also has a lot
of<00:02:48.810> clunky<00:02:49.290> lines<00:02:49.680> and<00:02:50.010> I<00:02:50.070> think<00:02:50.100> that<00:02:50.640> I<00:02:50.910> will

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
of clunky lines and I think that I will

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.260 
of clunky lines and I think that I will
think<00:02:52.380> about<00:02:52.470> this<00:02:52.800> book<00:02:53.100> long<00:02:53.430> after<00:02:53.970> I<00:02:54.000> read

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
think about this book long after I read

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.060 
think about this book long after I read
it<00:02:54.300> I<00:02:54.420> just<00:02:54.780> finished<00:02:55.050> it<00:02:55.230> today<00:02:55.500> which<00:02:55.710> is<00:02:55.740> why

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
it I just finished it today which is why

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.340 
it I just finished it today which is why
everything<00:02:56.820> is<00:02:57.000> very<00:02:57.120> fresh<00:02:57.240> in<00:02:57.720> my<00:02:57.840> mind<00:02:58.050> I

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
everything is very fresh in my mind I

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.080 
everything is very fresh in my mind I
think<00:02:58.770> I'll<00:02:59.040> continue<00:02:59.310> to<00:02:59.490> think<00:02:59.730> about<00:02:59.970> this

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
think I'll continue to think about this

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.240 
think I'll continue to think about this
book<00:03:00.330> for<00:03:00.540> a<00:03:00.570> while<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:01.200> I'll<00:03:01.320> remember<00:03:01.560> only

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
book for a while and I'll remember only

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.540 
book for a while and I'll remember only
the<00:03:03.090> emotions<00:03:03.690> that<00:03:04.010> that<00:03:05.010> really<00:03:05.160> worked<00:03:05.430> for

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
the emotions that that really worked for

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.460 
the emotions that that really worked for
me<00:03:05.760> and<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.240> sentences<00:03:06.840> that<00:03:06.870> were<00:03:07.050> beautiful

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
me and the sentences that were beautiful

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.870 
me and the sentences that were beautiful
and<00:03:07.590> I'll<00:03:07.710> forget<00:03:08.010> all<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.340> kind<00:03:08.520> of<00:03:08.610> clunky

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
and I'll forget all the kind of clunky

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.420 
and I'll forget all the kind of clunky
lines<00:03:09.270> and<00:03:09.720> all<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:09.920> it's<00:03:10.920> not<00:03:11.160> that

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
lines and all the it's not that

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.490 
lines and all the it's not that
Hemingway<00:03:11.730> provides<00:03:12.180> no<00:03:12.420> description<00:03:13.020> if

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
Hemingway provides no description if

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.990 
Hemingway provides no description if
that<00:03:13.650> he<00:03:13.710> provides<00:03:14.010> description<00:03:14.640> of<00:03:14.760> things

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
that he provides description of things

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.570 
that he provides description of things
that<00:03:15.410> aren't<00:03:16.410> that<00:03:16.440> interesting<00:03:16.980> like<00:03:17.190> how

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
that aren't that interesting like how

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.610 
that aren't that interesting like how
much<00:03:17.760> you<00:03:17.910> paid<00:03:18.120> for<00:03:18.150> something<00:03:18.660> or<00:03:19.140> the

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
much you paid for something or the

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.640 
much you paid for something or the
actual<00:03:19.980> act<00:03:20.190> of<00:03:20.370> paying<00:03:20.670> a<00:03:20.820> bill<00:03:21.000> or<00:03:21.390> it's<00:03:21.840> so<00:03:22.350> I

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
actual act of paying a bill or it's so I

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.860 
actual act of paying a bill or it's so I
don't<00:03:22.800> know<00:03:22.860> I<00:03:23.160> it<00:03:24.150> that<00:03:24.210> seems<00:03:24.660> like<00:03:24.840> a

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
don't know I it that seems like a

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.130 
don't know I it that seems like a
deliberate<00:03:25.530> choice<00:03:25.560> but<00:03:26.400> and<00:03:26.930> it<00:03:27.930> gives

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
deliberate choice but and it gives

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.130 
deliberate choice but and it gives
something<00:03:28.530> to<00:03:28.800> the<00:03:29.130> book<00:03:29.310> but<00:03:29.970> you<00:03:30.750> almost<00:03:30.870> are

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
something to the book but you almost are

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.560 
something to the book but you almost are
like<00:03:31.350> I<00:03:31.590> want<00:03:32.010> to<00:03:32.130> know<00:03:32.250> more<00:03:32.640> about<00:03:32.670> how<00:03:33.240> they

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
like I want to know more about how they

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.350 
like I want to know more about how they
feel<00:03:33.840> and<00:03:34.170> less<00:03:34.440> about<00:03:34.770> how<00:03:35.460> much<00:03:35.760> they<00:03:36.000> paid

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
feel and less about how much they paid

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.840 
feel and less about how much they paid
for<00:03:36.390> that<00:03:36.840> glass<00:03:37.290> of<00:03:37.530> scotch<00:03:37.770> if<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.490> question

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
for that glass of scotch if the question

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.730 
for that glass of scotch if the question
is<00:03:38.880> should<00:03:39.150> you<00:03:39.330> read<00:03:39.570> the<00:03:39.720> Sun<00:03:39.900> Also<00:03:40.200> Rises<00:03:40.230> I

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 
is should you read the Sun Also Rises I

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.320 
is should you read the Sun Also Rises I
would<00:03:40.890> say<00:03:41.070> absolutely<00:03:41.790> it's<00:03:42.030> certainly

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
would say absolutely it's certainly

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.680 
would say absolutely it's certainly
worth<00:03:42.660> reading<00:03:43.020> I<00:03:43.500> did<00:03:44.460> enjoy<00:03:44.910> reading<00:03:45.420> it

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
worth reading I did enjoy reading it

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.840 
worth reading I did enjoy reading it
fairly<00:03:46.140> quick<00:03:46.350> read<00:03:46.560> it's<00:03:46.770> only<00:03:46.920> like<00:03:47.100> 250

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
fairly quick read it's only like 250

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.640 
fairly quick read it's only like 250
pages<00:03:48.090> I<00:03:48.540> didn't<00:03:48.870> love<00:03:49.020> it<00:03:49.050> as<00:03:49.230> much<00:03:49.260> as<00:03:49.440> I

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
pages I didn't love it as much as I

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.530 
pages I didn't love it as much as I
loved<00:03:49.860> a<00:03:50.040> moveable<00:03:50.520> feast<00:03:50.550> but<00:03:51.060> I<00:03:51.090> loved<00:03:51.390> it<00:03:51.510> a

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
loved a moveable feast but I loved it a

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.620 
loved a moveable feast but I loved it a
lot<00:03:51.990> more<00:03:52.320> than<00:03:52.710> a<00:03:52.980> farewell<00:03:53.460> to<00:03:53.670> arms<00:03:53.880> but<00:03:54.600> I

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
lot more than a farewell to arms but I

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.090 
lot more than a farewell to arms but I
kind<00:03:54.870> of<00:03:54.930> wonder<00:03:55.200> about<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:55.530> relationship

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
kind of wonder about the relationship

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.640 
kind of wonder about the relationship
between<00:03:56.340> Sun<00:03:57.240> Also<00:03:57.540> Rises<00:03:57.570> and<00:03:58.110> A<00:03:58.260> Farewell<00:03:58.470> to

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
between Sun Also Rises and A Farewell to

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.430 
between Sun Also Rises and A Farewell to
Arms<00:03:58.800> I<00:03:59.310> almost<00:04:00.060> want<00:04:00.360> to<00:04:00.390> compare<00:04:00.810> it<00:04:00.930> to<00:04:01.140> the

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
Arms I almost want to compare it to the

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.630 
Arms I almost want to compare it to the
difference<00:04:01.770> between<00:04:01.920> The<00:04:02.220> Grapes<00:04:02.400> of<00:04:02.580> Wrath

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
difference between The Grapes of Wrath

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.090 
difference between The Grapes of Wrath
and<00:04:02.820> East<00:04:03.270> of<00:04:03.420> Eden<00:04:03.510> where<00:04:04.290> one<00:04:04.770> of<00:04:04.800> them<00:04:05.070> I

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
and East of Eden where one of them I

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.490 
and East of Eden where one of them I
loved<00:04:05.490> so<00:04:05.730> much<00:04:05.880> more<00:04:06.240> but<00:04:06.930> the<00:04:07.050> other<00:04:07.230> one<00:04:07.470> I

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
loved so much more but the other one I

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.830 
loved so much more but the other one I
can<00:04:07.860> see<00:04:08.070> is<00:04:08.190> more<00:04:08.370> important<00:04:08.940> I<00:04:09.150> think<00:04:09.660> that

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
can see is more important I think that

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.110 
can see is more important I think that
might<00:04:10.020> be<00:04:10.140> the<00:04:10.320> case<00:04:10.560> with<00:04:11.220> this<00:04:11.520> I<00:04:11.820> find

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
might be the case with this I find

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.730 
might be the case with this I find
Hemingway<00:04:12.540> to<00:04:12.570> be<00:04:12.810> a<00:04:12.840> curious<00:04:13.170> literary

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
Hemingway to be a curious literary

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.860 
Hemingway to be a curious literary
