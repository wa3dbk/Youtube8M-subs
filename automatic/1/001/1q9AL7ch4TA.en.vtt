00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.480
 Until now by relay 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:13.280
 Because I was only able to enter the representative in the form 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:17.730
 If you turn off the first waveform display in your personal 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:21.270
 Although it was also a result that I was not quite convinced for 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.450
 I feel a little relieved 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:29.190
 After all up to 4 people are beautiful 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:32.140
 Even then I have to say I can go, if that is not eight cancer in one of up to 4 people 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.460
 Well after all a little compared to the individual 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.880
 Now 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.970
 It seems like success stories are sweet 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.620
 Because I also had my own thoughts 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:45.260
 Firmly in the personal category 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.010
 To take 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.010
 It was good to come 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.750
 The world in last December 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.210
 Good Kansai meeting 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.780
 I was allowed to put out a 200m butterfly 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.780
 After all 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:06.940
 It is said that I will give the end of the stage for myself 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.250
 It was also one goal 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:13.190
 I went to do this 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.190
 I can take the representative right and head for July again 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:20.159
 I feel that I'm going to fight again about 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.159
 Well I got a throat book- 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:32.760
 Ogino players from nearby cities 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.360
 Japan team many medals 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:39.100
 Take off 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:41.180
 It was very exciting by myself and soon 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.530
 in curry 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:48.299
 And other tournaments 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.790
 The fly was still very good so I have been training well for this year 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.520
 I intended 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:58.800
 I think that led to such a result 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:04.260
 Yes, there are lots of stops that are really close to the age 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:08.180
 That said, there are a lot of seniors who will pull on that too, so yes 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.180
 It is very easy to do in a sense 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.420
 Of course there are times when it is messed up by the car player 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.750
 While enjoying it 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.060
 I think a key 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:22.640
 I'm doing 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.640
 Um In Japan Championship 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:32.360
 Until then 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:34.780
 A few of the swims I had done in the training camp and the swims I took at the competition venue 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:42.420
 The disturbance has come out 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:42.420
 There was a time when I had pasted it, and there was a part that did not go well in my own 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.510
 Toka or elected European Grand Prix 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:51.709
 After all other 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:54.500
 I have an opportunity to be in Japan for May, so I 'm still there 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.450
 To be able to swim in the up 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.390
 The top came 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.000
 I can use it without 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.590
 Center on the city 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.800
 I think that want to continue working 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.900
 For the 200-meter Butterfly event 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.780
 Hmm 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.540
 Everyone is the last 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.260
 Apply 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.890
 Because I think it's attention 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.890
 there 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.210
 we 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.210
 In the last 50 meters 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.790
 Victory against the specifications of this world 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:33.880
 Because I think that I should go to the floor 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.390
 I think I want you to see it by all means 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.390
 There
