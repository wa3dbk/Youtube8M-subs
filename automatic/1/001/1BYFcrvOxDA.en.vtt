videos<00:01:51.740> begin<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.920> load<00:01:53.159> up<00:01:53.340> on<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.759> timeline

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
videos begin to load up on the timeline

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.560 
videos begin to load up on the timeline
we<00:01:55.500> expand<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.070> as<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.880> videos<00:01:57.180> load<00:01:57.360> into

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
we expand that as the videos load into

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.840 
we expand that as the videos load into
the<00:01:57.659> timeline<00:01:57.930> movie<00:01:58.890> makers<00:01:59.250> just<00:01:59.399> eating<00:01:59.729> up

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
the timeline movie makers just eating up

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.220 
the timeline movie makers just eating up
more<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.450> more<00:02:00.509> memory

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.230 
more and more memory

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.200 
more and more memory
and<00:02:01.320> that's<00:02:01.950> pretty<00:02:02.160> much<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.550> basic<00:02:02.880> problem

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
and that's pretty much the basic problem

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.250 
and that's pretty much the basic problem
here<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:04.400> this<00:02:05.400> is<00:02:05.520> just<00:02:05.700> absurd<00:02:05.970> and<00:02:06.510> by<00:02:07.200> the

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
here and this is just absurd and by the

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.170 
here and this is just absurd and by the
time<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.650> go<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.800> render<00:02:08.160> your<00:02:08.250> video<00:02:08.580> it's

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:09.180 
time you go to render your video it's

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.930 
time you go to render your video it's
going<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.390> give<00:02:09.570> you<00:02:09.660> ton<00:02:09.900> of<00:02:09.930> problems<00:02:10.790> so<00:02:11.790> as

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
going to give you ton of problems so as

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.930 
going to give you ton of problems so as
I<00:02:12.030> scroll<00:02:12.300> down<00:02:12.360> some<00:02:12.720> more<00:02:12.900> it's<00:02:13.230> getting

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
I scroll down some more it's getting

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.610 
I scroll down some more it's getting
ridiculous<00:02:14.940> over<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:15.750> gig<00:02:16.020> now<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:18.380> there's<00:02:19.380> no

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
ridiculous over a gig now and there's no

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.170 
ridiculous over a gig now and there's no
reason<00:02:20.010> for<00:02:20.040> this<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:20.520> don't<00:02:20.640> know<00:02:20.820> what<00:02:21.030> the

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
reason for this I don't know what the

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.870 
reason for this I don't know what the
problem<00:02:21.540> is<00:02:21.720> I've<00:02:22.470> had<00:02:22.770> better<00:02:23.520> luck<00:02:23.820> with

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
problem is I've had better luck with

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.450 
problem is I've had better luck with
Windows<00:02:24.780> Movie<00:02:24.990> Maker<00:02:25.170> I<00:02:25.710> don't<00:02:26.220> know<00:02:26.280> what

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
Windows Movie Maker I don't know what

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.610 
Windows Movie Maker I don't know what
why<00:02:27.150> they<00:02:27.300> even<00:02:27.330> bothered<00:02:27.570> with<00:02:28.050> live<00:02:28.320> it's

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
why they even bothered with live it's

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.830 
why they even bothered with live it's
kind<00:02:29.400> of<00:02:29.460> a<00:02:29.550> downgrade<00:02:29.880> if<00:02:30.300> you<00:02:30.390> ask<00:02:30.540> me<00:02:31.550> so<00:02:32.840> one

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
kind of a downgrade if you ask me so one

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.360 
kind of a downgrade if you ask me so one
way<00:02:34.020> you<00:02:34.050> can<00:02:34.290> fix<00:02:34.500> this<00:02:34.680> is<00:02:34.860> on<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.100> bottom

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
way you can fix this is on the bottom

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.250 
way you can fix this is on the bottom
right<00:02:35.550> here<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:35.940> want<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.240> put<00:02:36.750> that<00:02:36.870> slider

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
right here you want to put that slider

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.370 
right here you want to put that slider
all<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.560> way<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.770> zoom<00:02:38.130> in<00:02:38.480> so<00:02:39.480> that<00:02:39.660> a<00:02:39.930> couple

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
all the way to zoom in so that a couple

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.010 
all the way to zoom in so that a couple
clips<00:02:40.560> are<00:02:40.740> loaded<00:02:41.070> into<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:42.120> view<00:02:42.330> close

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
clips are loaded into the view close

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.840 
clips are loaded into the view close
moviemaker<00:02:43.590> that's<00:02:43.860> important<00:02:44.400> because<00:02:44.670> you

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
moviemaker that's important because you

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.970 
moviemaker that's important because you
want<00:02:45.180> it<00:02:45.210> to<00:02:45.270> clear<00:02:45.540> out<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.720> memory<00:02:46.050> open<00:02:46.860> it

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
want it to clear out the memory open it

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.690 
want it to clear out the memory open it
again<00:02:47.190> and<00:02:48.560> you<00:02:49.560> want<00:02:49.740> to<00:02:49.860> make<00:02:50.100> your<00:02:50.220> timeline

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
again and you want to make your timeline

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.380 
again and you want to make your timeline
small<00:02:52.040> so<00:02:53.040> that<00:02:53.100> not<00:02:53.700> too<00:02:53.850> many<00:02:53.940> clips<00:02:54.240> are

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
small so that not too many clips are

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.230 
small so that not too many clips are
being<00:02:54.570> loaded<00:02:54.780> at<00:02:55.020> once<00:02:55.760> so<00:02:56.760> as<00:02:56.790> you<00:02:57.060> can<00:02:57.180> see

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
being loaded at once so as you can see

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.240 
being loaded at once so as you can see
I've<00:02:57.480> only<00:02:57.630> got<00:02:57.810> about<00:02:57.870> three<00:02:58.590> clips<00:02:58.920> loaded

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
I've only got about three clips loaded

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.200 
I've only got about three clips loaded
at<00:02:59.340> once<00:02:59.550> now<00:03:01.250> and<00:03:02.250> if<00:03:02.550> you<00:03:02.640> look<00:03:02.760> on<00:03:02.910> the<00:03:03.000> left

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
at once now and if you look on the left

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:04.700 
at once now and if you look on the left
the<00:03:03.360> memory<00:03:03.660> is<00:03:03.750> really<00:03:03.900> not<00:03:04.050> that<00:03:04.110> bad<00:03:04.500> it's

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
the memory is really not that bad it's

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:12.290 
the memory is really not that bad it's
still<00:03:05.459> under<00:03:05.670> 100<00:03:06.540> megabytes<00:03:08.270> roughly<00:03:11.150> so<00:03:12.150> now

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
still under 100 megabytes roughly so now

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:19.430 
still under 100 megabytes roughly so now
I'm<00:03:12.510> going<00:03:12.660> to<00:03:12.780> go<00:03:12.870> save<00:03:13.290> my<00:03:13.470> movie<00:03:13.740> file

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.850 

and<00:03:19.530> it<00:03:20.160> should<00:03:20.460> save<00:03:20.850> in<00:03:21.180> 1080p<00:03:22.170> with<00:03:22.560> no

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.530 
yet but as you can see I am I have sped
up<00:03:37.830> the<00:03:38.010> video<00:03:38.130> to<00:03:38.910> show<00:03:39.120> you<00:03:39.150> that<00:03:39.390> it<00:03:39.510> is

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
up the video to show you that it is

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.160 
up the video to show you that it is
rendering<00:03:40.020> just<00:03:40.320> fine<00:03:41.600> and<00:03:42.600> hopefully<00:03:43.020> this

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
rendering just fine and hopefully this

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.620 
rendering just fine and hopefully this
works<00:03:43.320> for<00:03:43.620> you<00:03:43.740> too<00:03:46.490> and<00:03:47.490> movie<00:03:48.180> maker<00:03:48.390> will

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
works for you too and movie maker will

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.690 
works for you too and movie maker will
tend<00:03:48.840> to<00:03:48.900> hang<00:03:49.140> a<00:03:49.200> little<00:03:49.230> bit<00:03:49.440> at<00:03:49.590> 99%<00:03:50.220> but

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
tend to hang a little bit at 99% but

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.480 
tend to hang a little bit at 99% but
usually<00:03:51.540> gets<00:03:51.690> over<00:03:51.930> that<00:03:52.250> and<00:03:53.250> as<00:03:53.340> you<00:03:53.430> can

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
usually gets over that and as you can

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.830 
usually gets over that and as you can
see<00:03:53.610> my<00:03:53.850> video<00:03:54.090> is<00:03:54.270> done<00:03:54.510> now<00:03:56.600> so<00:03:57.600> we're<00:03:57.720> going

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
see my video is done now so we're going

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:04.809 
see my video is done now so we're going
to<00:03:57.930> go<00:03:58.020> and<00:03:58.290> play

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.289 

and<00:04:05.420> there<00:04:05.719> it<00:04:05.810> is<00:04:06.140> all<00:04:07.129> 12<00:04:07.519> minutes<00:04:07.790> and<00:04:07.909> 34

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
and there it is all 12 minutes and 34
