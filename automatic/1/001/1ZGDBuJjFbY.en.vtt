00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.660 

what's<00:00:04.170> going<00:00:04.410> on<00:00:04.529> guys<00:00:04.740> in<00:00:05.009> today's<00:00:05.430> tutorial

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
what's going on guys in today's tutorial

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.150 
what's going on guys in today's tutorial
we<00:00:06.210> are<00:00:06.359> going<00:00:06.540> to<00:00:06.600> learn<00:00:06.750> about<00:00:06.980> saving<00:00:07.980> some

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
we are going to learn about saving some

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.490 
we are going to learn about saving some
data<00:00:08.370> to<00:00:08.730> our<00:00:08.760> application<00:00:09.510> so<00:00:09.719> even<00:00:10.290> if<00:00:10.380> the

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
data to our application so even if the

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.499 
data to our application so even if the
user<00:00:10.620> exits<00:00:11.250> application<00:00:12.030> and<00:00:12.179> then<00:00:12.269> comes

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
user exits application and then comes

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.720 
user exits application and then comes
back<00:00:12.660> that<00:00:13.559> that<00:00:13.920> information<00:00:14.429> is<00:00:14.519> going<00:00:14.639> to

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
back that that information is going to

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.730 
back that that information is going to
be<00:00:14.820> stored<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:15.599> it's<00:00:15.780> going<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:15.990> be<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.500> same

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
be stored and it's going to be the same

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.349 
be stored and it's going to be the same
so<00:00:17.039> we're<00:00:17.340> going<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.550> have<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.670> high<00:00:17.820> score

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
so we're going to have a high score

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.240 
so we're going to have a high score
essentially<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.170> that's<00:00:19.710> going<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.100> be

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
essentially and that's going to be

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.310 
essentially and that's going to be
consistent<00:00:21.150> each<00:00:21.600> time<00:00:21.930> they<00:00:22.050> use<00:00:22.199> their

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
consistent each time they use their

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.960 
consistent each time they use their
application<00:00:22.859> it's<00:00:23.160> not<00:00:23.340> going<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.580> erase<00:00:23.760> that

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
application it's not going to erase that

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.179 
application it's not going to erase that
data<00:00:24.180> for<00:00:24.449> us<00:00:24.600> so<00:00:25.199> let's<00:00:25.439> just<00:00:25.590> jump<00:00:25.650> into<00:00:26.160> it

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
data for us so let's just jump into it

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.950 
data for us so let's just jump into it
what<00:00:26.880> we're<00:00:26.970> going<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.150> do<00:00:27.300> first<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:27.750> work

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
what we're going to do first is work

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.419 
what we're going to do first is work
with<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.230> ball<00:00:28.439> script<00:00:28.800> because<00:00:28.980> again

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
with the ball script because again

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.600 
with the ball script because again
within<00:00:29.609> our<00:00:29.849> game<00:00:30.090> over<00:00:30.390> function<00:00:30.810> we<00:00:30.960> want<00:00:31.199> to

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:31.610 
within our game over function we want to

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.770 
within our game over function we want to
save<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:33.000> score<00:00:33.960> here<00:00:35.360> because<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.570> games

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
save I score here because the games

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.840 
save I score here because the games
obviously<00:00:36.989> over<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.739> we<00:00:38.309> want<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.579> do<00:00:38.700> that

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
obviously over and we want to do that

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.000 
obviously over and we want to do that
before<00:00:39.090> we<00:00:39.660> load<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.200> new<00:00:40.350> level<00:00:40.680> otherwise

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
before we load the new level otherwise

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.080 
before we load the new level otherwise
it's<00:00:41.309> going<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.489> cause<00:00:41.700> us<00:00:41.910> some<00:00:42.030> problems

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
it's going to cause us some problems

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.090 
it's going to cause us some problems
because<00:00:42.780> we're<00:00:43.020> loading<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> new<00:00:43.440> level<00:00:43.770> then

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
because we're loading a new level then

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.160 
because we're loading a new level then
we're<00:00:44.250> trying<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.550> save<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.760> high<00:00:44.940> score<00:00:45.300> it's

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
we're trying to save the high score it's

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.900 
we're trying to save the high score it's
just<00:00:46.379> better<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.680> do<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.129> right<00:00:47.309> before<00:00:47.460> the

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
just better to do it right before the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.639 
just better to do it right before the
load<00:00:48.090> level<00:00:48.480> alright<00:00:48.930> so<00:00:49.140> how<00:00:49.320> we're<00:00:49.500> going<00:00:49.590> to

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
load level alright so how we're going to

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.110 
load level alright so how we're going to
do<00:00:49.860> this<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.190> create<00:00:50.489> an<00:00:50.579> if<00:00:50.730> statement

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
do this is create an if statement

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.819 
do this is create an if statement
because<00:00:51.600> we<00:00:51.719> want<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:51.989> check<00:00:52.260> whatever<00:00:52.530> the

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
because we want to check whatever the

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.040 
because we want to check whatever the
global<00:00:53.250> high<00:00:53.399> score<00:00:53.760> is<00:00:53.910> already<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.840> if<00:00:54.930> our

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
global high score is already and if our

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.200 
global high score is already and if our
current<00:00:55.260> score<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:56.070> game<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.640> higher

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
current score of this game is higher

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.020 
current score of this game is higher
than<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.260> high<00:00:58.859> score<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.640> we<00:00:59.760> saved

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
than that that high score that we saved

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.330 
than that that high score that we saved
within<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.480> application<00:01:01.079> then<00:01:01.649> we're<00:01:02.219> going

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
within the application then we're going

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.100 
within the application then we're going
to<00:01:02.430> update<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:03.000> high<00:01:03.120> score<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:03.960> we're<00:01:04.080> just

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
to update the high score so we're just

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.740 
to update the high score so we're just
going<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.439> check<00:01:04.680> if<00:01:04.909> current<00:01:05.909> score<00:01:06.330> which<00:01:06.540> we

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
going to check if current score which we

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.380 
going to check if current score which we
called<00:01:07.020> score<00:01:07.500> here<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.070> greater<00:01:08.820> than<00:01:09.060> and

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
called score here is greater than and

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.760 
called score here is greater than and
we're<00:01:09.510> going<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.720> refer<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.020> something<00:01:10.470> called

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
we're going to refer to something called

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.109 
we're going to refer to something called
the<00:01:10.890> players<00:01:11.250> press<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.560> basically<00:01:13.560> our

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
the players press and basically our

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.070 
the players press and basically our
application<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.390> can<00:01:15.540> think<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:15.960> as<00:01:16.020> a

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
application you can think of it as a

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.960 
application you can think of it as a
mansion<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.890> has<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.040> bunch<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.580> different

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
mansion it has a bunch of different

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.719 
mansion it has a bunch of different
classes<00:01:18.600> or<00:01:19.080> different<00:01:19.650> rooms<00:01:19.979> within<00:01:20.490> this

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
classes or different rooms within this

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.940 
classes or different rooms within this
mansion<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.360> one<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:21.960> these<00:01:22.020> rooms<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:22.680> called

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
mansion and one of these rooms is called

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.280 
mansion and one of these rooms is called
player<00:01:23.189> preps<00:01:23.670> now<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.420> can<00:01:24.630> open<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:25.080> door

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
player preps now you can open this door

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.740 
player preps now you can open this door
up<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:26.250> can<00:01:26.430> store<00:01:26.880> some<00:01:27.180> data<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.600> there

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
up and you can store some data in there

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.749 
up and you can store some data in there
you<00:01:27.930> can<00:01:28.049> store<00:01:28.290> some<00:01:28.470> boxes<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.310> can<00:01:29.460> store

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
you can store some boxes you can store

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.600 
you can store some boxes you can store
some<00:01:30.060> strings<00:01:30.570> or<00:01:30.930> some<00:01:31.110> integer<00:01:31.619> values<00:01:32.070> and

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
some strings or some integer values and

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.219 
some strings or some integer values and
what<00:01:32.729> we<00:01:32.759> want<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.119> do<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.360> we<00:01:33.509> want<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.780> get<00:01:34.049> the

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
what we want to do is we want to get the

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.190 
what we want to do is we want to get the
box<00:01:34.500> called<00:01:34.979> brickbreaker<00:01:35.610> high<00:01:36.030> score<00:01:36.630> and

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
box called brickbreaker high score and

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.020 
box called brickbreaker high score and
we<00:01:37.320> won't<00:01:37.530> want<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.770> open<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.130> value<00:01:38.640> up<00:01:38.820> and

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
we won't want to open that value up and

we won't want to open that value up and
see<00:01:39.390> what<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.689> integer<00:01:40.020> value<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.619> is<00:01:40.970> within

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
see what the integer value is is within

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.649 
see what the integer value is is within
that<00:01:42.299> box<00:01:43.009> so<00:01:44.009> how<00:01:44.700> we<00:01:44.759> do<00:01:44.939> that<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:45.270> we<00:01:45.420> go

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
that box so how we do that is we go

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.020 
that box so how we do that is we go
refer<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.470> player's<00:01:46.740> prefs<00:01:47.250> class<00:01:47.640> or

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
refer to the player's prefs class or

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.609 
refer to the player's prefs class or
room<00:01:48.329> however<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.899> want<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.110> think<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.470> it

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
room however you want to think of it

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.590 
room however you want to think of it
then<00:01:50.009> we're<00:01:50.100> going<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.280> say<00:01:50.369> get<00:01:50.640> int<00:01:50.939> because

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
then we're going to say get int because

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.120 
then we're going to say get int because
again<00:01:51.899> it's<00:01:52.140> integer<00:01:52.619> value<00:01:52.920> we're<00:01:53.100> looking

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
again it's integer value we're looking

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.039 
again it's integer value we're looking
for<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.939> we're<00:01:54.180> going<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.360> refer<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.930> the

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
for and we're going to refer to the

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.859 
for and we're going to refer to the
value<00:01:55.439> name<00:01:55.680> or<00:01:55.920> whatever<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.579> name<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:57.180> that

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
value name or whatever the name of that

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.899 
value name or whatever the name of that
box<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.500> we<00:01:58.770> stored<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.399> in<00:01:59.579> that

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
box is that we stored in that in that

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.990 
box is that we stored in that in that
room<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.659> we<00:02:00.750> can<00:02:00.899> say<00:02:01.110> brick<00:02:02.000> score

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
room and we can say brick score

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.370 
room and we can say brick score
something<00:02:03.329> like<00:02:03.540> that<00:02:03.780> whatever<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.290> guys

if it can't find the specific box it's

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.560 
if it can't find the specific box it's
going<00:02:22.780> to<00:02:22.900> create<00:02:23.230> one<00:02:23.560> for<00:02:24.340> us<00:02:24.580> and<00:02:24.850> if<00:02:25.360> that's

going to create one for us and if that's

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.410 
going to create one for us and if that's
the<00:02:25.810> case<00:02:25.990> then<00:02:26.380> we<00:02:26.500> want<00:02:26.710> to<00:02:26.770> save<00:02:27.100> or<00:02:28.090> we<00:02:28.240> want

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
the case then we want to save or we want

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.680 
the case then we want to save or we want
to<00:02:28.510> update<00:02:28.690> this<00:02:29.200> brick<00:02:29.560> score<00:02:30.160> box<00:02:31.120> and<00:02:31.480> put

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
to update this brick score box and put

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.570 
to update this brick score box and put
our<00:02:31.900> new<00:02:32.110> integer<00:02:32.620> in<00:02:32.770> there<00:02:32.980> which<00:02:33.220> will<00:02:33.460> be

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
our new integer in there which will be

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.240 
our new integer in there which will be
the<00:02:33.790> current<00:02:34.030> high<00:02:34.270> score<00:02:34.660> of<00:02:34.870> this<00:02:35.080> game

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
the current high score of this game

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.950 
the current high score of this game
hopefully<00:02:36.250> that<00:02:36.550> makes<00:02:36.760> sense<00:02:37.000> so<00:02:37.300> again

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
hopefully that makes sense so again

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.180 
hopefully that makes sense so again
we're<00:02:38.320> only<00:02:38.410> going<00:02:38.590> to<00:02:38.650> go<00:02:38.770> within<00:02:38.980> this

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
we're only going to go within this

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.920 
we're only going to go within this
condition<00:02:39.640> if<00:02:39.820> we<00:02:40.060> have<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.300> new<00:02:40.420> high<00:02:40.570> score

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
condition if we have the new high score

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.690 
condition if we have the new high score
at<00:02:41.080> this<00:02:41.260> game<00:02:41.500> you<00:02:41.950> know<00:02:42.040> how<00:02:42.130> we<00:02:42.190> do<00:02:42.400> this<00:02:42.550> is

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
at this game you know how we do this is

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.860 
at this game you know how we do this is
we're<00:02:42.880> just<00:02:42.910> going<00:02:43.120> to<00:02:43.210> refer<00:02:43.390> to<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.570> players

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
we're just going to refer to the players

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.410 
we're just going to refer to the players
preps<00:02:44.350> again<00:02:44.830> and<00:02:45.100> instead<00:02:45.700> of<00:02:45.820> saying<00:02:46.060> get

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
preps again and instead of saying get

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.930 
preps again and instead of saying get
we're<00:02:46.720> going<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:46.870> say<00:02:47.050> set<00:02:47.530> int<00:02:47.920> and<00:02:48.520> again

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
we're going to say set int and again

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.940 
we're going to say set int and again
we're<00:02:49.090> setting<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.600> integer<00:02:50.020> value<00:02:50.410> for<00:02:50.800> the

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
we're setting the integer value for the

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.630 
we're setting the integer value for the
box<00:02:51.190> that<00:02:51.880> we<00:02:52.030> set<00:02:52.300> up<00:02:52.330> brick<00:02:52.900> score<00:02:53.290> and<00:02:53.640> then

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
box that we set up brick score and then

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.040 
box that we set up brick score and then
we're<00:02:54.790> giving<00:02:54.880> it<00:02:55.150> a<00:02:55.240> value<00:02:55.390> this<00:02:55.810> could<00:02:55.960> be

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
we're giving it a value this could be

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.540 
we're giving it a value this could be
like<00:02:56.170> one<00:02:56.410> two<00:02:56.590> whatever

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
like one two whatever

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.490 
like one two whatever
since<00:02:58.000> this<00:02:58.210> integer<00:02:58.630> we<00:02:58.930> have<00:02:59.050> to<00:02:59.170> give<00:02:59.290> it<00:02:59.410> an

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
since this integer we have to give it an

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.130 
since this integer we have to give it an
integer<00:02:59.830> value<00:03:00.340> and<00:03:00.520> again<00:03:01.240> since<00:03:01.600> our<00:03:01.750> score

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
integer value and again since our score

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.750 
integer value and again since our score
is<00:03:02.170> integer<00:03:02.650> that's<00:03:03.310> what<00:03:03.460> we're<00:03:03.580> going<00:03:03.700> to

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
is integer that's what we're going to

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.520 
is integer that's what we're going to
save<00:03:04.000> within<00:03:04.390> this<00:03:04.510> game<00:03:04.690> over<00:03:04.900> here<00:03:05.290> so<00:03:05.440> we're

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
save within this game over here so we're

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.710 
save within this game over here so we're
going<00:03:05.620> to<00:03:05.680> say<00:03:05.830> game<00:03:06.460> over<00:03:06.760> or<00:03:07.480> I'm<00:03:07.570> sorry

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
going to say game over or I'm sorry

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.100 
going to say game over or I'm sorry
score<00:03:08.350> and<00:03:08.530> that's<00:03:09.490> how<00:03:09.670> that<00:03:09.730> works<00:03:10.000> so<00:03:10.270> what

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
score and that's how that works so what

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.300 
score and that's how that works so what
we're<00:03:11.350> doing<00:03:11.380> is<00:03:11.620> we're<00:03:11.770> checking<00:03:11.980> if<00:03:12.190> the

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
we're doing is we're checking if the

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.950 
we're doing is we're checking if the
current<00:03:12.550> score<00:03:12.790> is<00:03:12.820> greater<00:03:13.120> than<00:03:13.420> whatever

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:13.960 
current score is greater than whatever

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.900 
current score is greater than whatever
the<00:03:14.230> you<00:03:14.830> know<00:03:14.920> whatever<00:03:15.040> is<00:03:15.340> within<00:03:15.550> our

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
the you know whatever is within our

to<00:03:41.230> create<00:03:41.290> a<00:03:41.500> new<00:03:41.709> function<00:03:42.120> called<00:03:43.120> awake

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
to create a new function called awake

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.170 
to create a new function called awake
now<00:03:44.650> awake<00:03:44.890> is<00:03:45.070> kind<00:03:45.310> of<00:03:45.340> like<00:03:45.490> start<00:03:45.910> it's

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
now awake is kind of like start it's

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.390 
now awake is kind of like start it's
only<00:03:46.390> going<00:03:46.540> to<00:03:46.600> be<00:03:46.660> called<00:03:46.900> once<00:03:47.230> and<00:03:47.590> once<00:03:48.250> we

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
only going to be called once and once we

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.060 
only going to be called once and once we
awake<00:03:48.760> this<00:03:49.090> object<00:03:49.600> that<00:03:50.440> we've<00:03:50.590> attached<00:03:50.890> to

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
awake this object that we've attached to

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.740 
awake this object that we've attached to
the<00:03:51.130> script<00:03:51.430> to<00:03:51.580> we're<00:03:52.209> going<00:03:52.300> to<00:03:52.390> call<00:03:52.600> this

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
the script to we're going to call this

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.810 
the script to we're going to call this
awake<00:03:53.170> method<00:03:53.560> one<00:03:53.800> time<00:03:54.100> and<00:03:54.340> all<00:03:54.670> we're

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
awake method one time and all we're

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.740 
awake method one time and all we're
going<00:03:54.910> to<00:03:54.970> do<00:03:55.209> is<00:03:55.450> change<00:03:56.170> the<00:03:56.620> text<00:03:57.100> of<00:03:57.250> our<00:03:57.750> 3d

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
going to do is change the text of our 3d

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.870 
going to do is change the text of our 3d
text<00:03:59.200> object<00:03:59.560> that<00:03:59.650> we<00:03:59.770> set<00:03:59.950> up<00:04:00.070> here<00:04:00.490> so<00:04:00.640> we

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
text object that we set up here so we

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.940 
text object that we set up here so we
first<00:04:01.060> have<00:04:01.150> to<00:04:01.300> relate<00:04:01.660> to<00:04:01.690> that<00:04:02.140> text<00:04:02.590> object

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
first have to relate to that text object

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.640 
first have to relate to that text object
somehow<00:04:03.250> so<00:04:03.490> we're<00:04:03.580> going<00:04:03.670> to<00:04:03.760> create<00:04:04.030> a<00:04:04.090> new

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
somehow so we're going to create a new

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.880 
somehow so we're going to create a new
variable<00:04:05.650> called<00:04:06.180> B<00:04:07.180> score<00:04:07.720> and<00:04:08.620> we're<00:04:08.770> going

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
variable called B score and we're going

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.780 
variable called B score and we're going
to<00:04:08.920> give<00:04:09.130> this<00:04:09.280> the<00:04:09.340> type<00:04:09.820> of<00:04:10.170> text<00:04:11.170> mesh<00:04:11.790> all

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
to give this the type of text mesh all

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.280 
to give this the type of text mesh all
right<00:04:12.910> so<00:04:13.150> a<00:04:13.180> 3d<00:04:13.890> text<00:04:14.890> object<00:04:15.660> game<00:04:16.660> object<00:04:17.140> is

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
right so a 3d text object game object is

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.920 
right so a 3d text object game object is
of<00:04:18.250> the<00:04:18.370> type<00:04:18.580> text<00:04:19.000> mesh<00:04:19.239> if<00:04:19.510> we're<00:04:19.690> just

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
of the type text mesh if we're just

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.570 
of the type text mesh if we're just
trying<00:04:20.140> to<00:04:20.200> change<00:04:20.440> the<00:04:20.710> text<00:04:21.160> so<00:04:21.280> now<00:04:21.400> within

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
trying to change the text so now within

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.430 
trying to change the text so now within
our<00:04:21.760> awake<00:04:22.000> method<00:04:22.360> we<00:04:22.479> can<00:04:22.660> refer<00:04:22.930> to<00:04:23.080> our<00:04:23.200> B

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
our awake method we can refer to our B

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.360 
our awake method we can refer to our B

put this in the wake method or the start

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.640 
put this in the wake method or the start
method<00:04:58.760> instead<00:04:59.720> of<00:04:59.870> like<00:05:00.080> the<00:05:00.169> update<00:05:00.500> method

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
method instead of like the update method

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.680 
method instead of like the update method
well<00:05:01.400> this<00:05:01.580> is<00:05:01.699> always<00:05:01.940> going<00:05:02.060> to<00:05:02.120> be<00:05:02.210> the<00:05:02.419> same

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
well this is always going to be the same

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.300 
well this is always going to be the same
when<00:05:02.900> we're<00:05:03.050> on<00:05:03.169> the<00:05:03.229> menu<00:05:03.410> screen<00:05:03.650> the<00:05:04.010> score

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
when we're on the menu screen the score

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.950 
when we're on the menu screen the score
is<00:05:04.370> never<00:05:04.550> going<00:05:04.699> to<00:05:04.760> get<00:05:05.000> changed<00:05:05.479> so<00:05:05.870> we

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
is never going to get changed so we

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.930

can see I have a score of 60 because I

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.620 
can see I have a score of 60 because I
already<00:05:49.430> tested<00:05:49.880> this<00:05:49.970> out<00:05:50.150> but<00:05:50.389> let's<00:05:50.510> try

already tested this out but let's try

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.230 
already tested this out but let's try
and<00:05:50.690> break<00:05:50.930> that<00:05:51.229> score<00:05:51.729> by<00:05:52.729> going<00:05:53.060> to<00:05:53.150> the

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
and break that score by going to the

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.040 
and break that score by going to the
brick<00:05:53.419> breaker<00:05:53.690> game<00:05:54.020> oh<00:05:54.970> no<00:05:55.970> that<00:05:56.780> didn't
