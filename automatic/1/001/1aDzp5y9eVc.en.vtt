00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
I made a pin harness in here it goes

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.170 
I made a pin harness in here it goes
down<00:04:03.359> into<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:03.900> lower<00:04:04.769> part<00:04:05.129> of<00:04:05.220> the<00:04:05.370> fuselage

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
do is unplug my multiplex pin that

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.839 
do is unplug my multiplex pin that
disconnects<00:04:22.500> all<00:04:22.710> the<00:04:22.860> electronics<00:04:23.580> in<00:04:23.699> the

disconnects all the electronics in the

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:28.670 
disconnects all the electronics in the
wing<00:04:25.310> next<00:04:26.310> I'll<00:04:26.430> flip<00:04:26.699> it<00:04:26.729> over<00:04:26.970> and<00:04:27.680> proceed

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.909 
to take the wing off okay now that I
have<00:04:33.240> the<00:04:33.800> electronics<00:04:34.800> disconnected<00:04:35.580> I<00:04:36.919> will

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
have the electronics disconnected I will

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.500 
have the electronics disconnected I will
show<00:04:38.160> I<00:04:39.620> use<00:04:40.620> it<00:04:40.800> is<00:04:40.979> take<00:04:41.520> this<00:04:41.699> wing<00:04:41.940> off

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
show I use it is take this wing off

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:49.490 
show I use it is take this wing off
I<00:04:45.710> don't<00:04:46.710> really<00:04:46.889> and<00:04:47.810> I'm<00:04:48.810> not<00:04:49.050> really<00:04:49.289> an

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:33.150 
a simple matter of lifting the wing out
of<00:05:30.190> the<00:05:30.310> cradle<00:05:31.000> here<00:05:31.300> in<00:05:31.389> the<00:05:31.479> front<00:05:32.160> pulling

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
of the cradle here in the front pulling

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.240 
of the cradle here in the front pulling
her<00:05:33.340> out<00:05:34.590> and<00:05:35.590> that's<00:05:35.740> it<00:05:36.030> the<00:05:37.030> wing<00:05:37.180> is<00:05:37.330> out

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
her out and that's it the wing is out

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.749 
her out and that's it the wing is out
the<00:05:39.250> harness<00:05:39.610> is<00:05:39.729> in<00:05:39.880> place<00:05:41.340> and<00:05:42.340> I'm<00:05:42.460> good<00:05:42.729> to

and<00:05:56.460> that's<00:05:56.940> how<00:05:57.150> a<00:05:57.180> wing<00:05:57.450> comes<00:05:58.410> off<00:05:58.620> the<00:05:58.980> star

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 
and that's how a wing comes off the star

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:07.130 
and that's how a wing comes off the star
max<00:06:02.870> they<00:06:03.870> put<00:06:04.080> her<00:06:04.170> back<00:06:04.350> together<00:06:06.110> take<00:06:07.110> the
