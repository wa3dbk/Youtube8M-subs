00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
surface okay we are going to squeeze

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.220 
surface okay we are going to squeeze
hard<00:03:57.880> and<00:03:58.880> we<00:03:59.180> are<00:03:59.240> going<00:03:59.480> to<00:03:59.600> start<00:03:59.930> like<00:04:00.200> a

little bit before you want the q1u shell

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.270 
little bit before you want the q1u shell
to<00:04:05.420> begin<00:04:05.810> because<00:04:06.740> what's<00:04:06.980> going<00:04:07.130> to<00:04:07.220> happen

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
is as you squeeze the bag the icing will

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.090 
is as you squeeze the bag the icing will
fan<00:04:12.770> out<00:04:13.300> okay<00:04:14.300> to<00:04:14.360> make<00:04:14.750> the<00:04:14.810> shell<00:04:15.320> so<00:04:16.010> you

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
the right pressure also the consistency

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.980 
the right pressure also the consistency
of<00:05:44.140> the<00:05:44.410> ice<00:05:44.560> thing<00:05:45.010> needs<00:05:45.250> to<00:05:45.430> be<00:05:45.780> perfect<00:05:46.780> for

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
of the ice thing needs to be perfect for

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.310 
of the ice thing needs to be perfect for
that<00:05:47.050> decoration<00:05:48.040> and<00:05:48.330> the<00:05:49.330> way<00:05:49.660> you<00:05:49.720> hold<00:05:50.110> you

that decoration and the way you hold you

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.840 
that decoration and the way you hold you
back<00:05:50.560> okay<00:05:51.460> in<00:05:51.760> this<00:05:52.270> case<00:05:52.540> is<00:05:52.810> a<00:05:52.840> 45°<00:05:53.830> angle<00:05:54.130> so

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:54.850 
back okay in this case is a 45° angle so

00:05:54.850 --> 00:06:06.720 
back okay in this case is a 45° angle so
I'm<00:05:54.910> going<00:05:55.120> to<00:05:55.180> pipe<00:05:55.480> another<00:05:55.900> road<00:05:56.170> here<00:05:56.470> look

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:06.730

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:40.750 
positioned and the pressure that you

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.960 
positioned and the pressure that you
apply<00:06:40.980> to<00:06:41.980> the<00:06:42.550> bag<00:06:42.790> is<00:06:43.210> the<00:06:43.480> right<00:06:43.720> pressure

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:44.970 
apply to the bag is the right pressure

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:49.860 
apply to the bag is the right pressure
now<00:06:47.220> not<00:06:48.220> too<00:06:48.580> much<00:06:48.760> pressure<00:06:49.030> or<00:06:49.420> not<00:06:49.450> too

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:49.870 
now not too much pressure or not too

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:51.480 
now not too much pressure or not too
little<00:06:50.110> pressure<00:06:50.410> but<00:06:50.650> the<00:06:50.920> right<00:06:51.130> pressure

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:51.490 
little pressure but the right pressure

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.840 
little pressure but the right pressure
and<00:06:52.000> make<00:06:52.630> sure<00:06:52.810> that<00:06:53.110> you<00:06:53.350> consistency<00:06:54.340> the

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:54.850 
and make sure that you consistency the

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:57.990 
and make sure that you consistency the
consistency<00:06:55.690> of<00:06:55.720> your<00:06:55.900> icing<00:06:56.650> is<00:06:56.890> also<00:06:57.850> the

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000 
consistency of your icing is also the

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.260 
consistency of your icing is also the
right<00:06:58.350> consistency<00:06:59.350> so<00:07:00.280> this<00:07:00.640> is<00:07:00.850> all<00:07:01.060> for

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:01.270 
right consistency so this is all for

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.680 
right consistency so this is all for
