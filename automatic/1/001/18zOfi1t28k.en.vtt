been a major free agent that has left so

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.899 
been a major free agent that has left so
I<00:01:09.720> think<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.229> once<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.710> dust<00:01:11.010> settles<00:01:11.189> and

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
I think that once the dust settles and

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.260 
I think that once the dust settles and
he<00:01:12.810> relaxes<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.530> he<00:01:13.619> looks<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.130> he<00:01:14.270> realized

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
he relaxes and he looks and he realized

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.820 
he relaxes and he looks and he realized
all<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.450> injury<00:01:15.840> problems<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.409> he<00:01:16.470> realizes

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
all the injury problems and he realizes

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.380 
all the injury problems and he realizes
that<00:01:16.979> D'Antoni<00:01:17.250> could<00:01:17.759> probably<00:01:17.970> change<00:01:18.240> the

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
that D'Antoni could probably change the

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.200 
that D'Antoni could probably change the
offi<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:18.840> some<00:01:19.020> form<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.939> think<00:01:20.939> it's<00:01:21.060> going<00:01:21.119> to

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
offi in some form I think it's going to

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.510 
offi in some form I think it's going to
be<00:01:21.330> hard<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.659> lead<00:01:21.960> this<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.439> really<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:23.130> this

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
be hard to lead this it really is this

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.770 
be hard to lead this it really is this
is<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:24.080> season<00:01:25.080> like<00:01:25.860> no<00:01:26.100> other<00:01:26.479> when<00:01:27.479> he<00:01:27.570> looks

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
is a season like no other when he looks

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.030 
is a season like no other when he looks
back<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:28.200> think<00:01:28.380> it's<00:01:28.500> going<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.650> be<00:01:28.770> really

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
back I think it's going to be really

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.010 
back I think it's going to be really
hard<00:01:29.369> for<00:01:29.700> him<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.240> not<00:01:30.479> walk<00:01:30.720> back<00:01:30.990> through

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
hard for him to not walk back through

hard for him to not walk back through

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.630 
same page I think Kobe's injury has
brought<00:02:29.870> them<00:02:30.050> closer<00:02:30.380> because<00:02:31.040> do<00:02:31.250> I<00:02:31.310> had<00:02:31.520> his

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
back injury and you know now he's got

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.340 
back injury and you know now he's got
somebody<00:02:35.060> that<00:02:35.270> can<00:02:35.390> console<00:02:35.780> him<00:02:35.990> and<00:02:36.020> knows

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
somebody that can console him and knows

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.830 
somebody that can console him and knows
what<00:02:36.380> its<00:02:37.040> toughest<00:02:37.940> recuperation<00:02:38.600> process

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
what its toughest recuperation process

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.270 
what its toughest recuperation process
is<00:02:39.640> but<00:02:40.640> again<00:02:41.360> this<00:02:42.080> could<00:02:42.320> all<00:02:42.560> be<00:02:42.740> his<00:02:42.980> a

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
is but again this could all be his a

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.150 
is but again this could all be his a
year<00:02:44.210> or<00:02:44.300> two<00:02:44.450> who<00:02:45.230> knows<00:02:45.440> how<00:02:45.620> much<00:02:45.800> Kobe

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
year or two who knows how much Kobe

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.000 
year or two who knows how much Kobe
could<00:02:46.310> play<00:02:46.460> again<00:02:46.790> and<00:02:47.210> I<00:02:48.170> don't<00:02:48.410> think<00:02:48.710> he'd

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
could play again and I don't think he'd

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.440 
could play again and I don't think he'd
have<00:02:49.130> a<00:02:49.220> problem<00:02:49.580> getting<00:02:49.700> free<00:02:50.000> agents<00:02:50.330> here
