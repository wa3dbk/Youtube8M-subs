bulky<00:02:27.640> which<00:02:27.940> I<00:02:28.060> like<00:02:28.270> looks<00:02:28.690> really<00:02:28.960> good<00:02:29.490> but

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
bulky which I like looks really good but

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.550 
bulky which I like looks really good but
there's<00:02:31.150> just<00:02:31.270> some<00:02:31.480> odd<00:02:31.690> to<00:02:31.990> him<00:02:32.170> I<00:02:32.230> don't<00:02:32.410> I

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.610 
there's just some odd to him I don't I
don't<00:02:33.070> even<00:02:33.190> know<00:02:33.430> what<00:02:34.120> it<00:02:34.270> is<00:02:34.420> but<00:02:34.690> he<00:02:35.590> looks

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
don't even know what it is but he looks

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.200 
don't even know what it is but he looks
kind<00:02:35.920> of<00:02:36.190> good<00:02:36.310> but<00:02:36.490> then<00:02:36.670> on<00:02:36.790> one<00:02:36.940> hand<00:02:37.090> he

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
kind of good but then on one hand he

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.020 
kind of good but then on one hand he
just<00:02:37.240> kind<00:02:37.540> of<00:02:37.600> odd<00:02:38.590> look<00:02:38.860> to<00:02:39.070> him<00:02:39.160> but<00:02:40.000> I
