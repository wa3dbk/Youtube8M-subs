00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:07.430
 recently scientists have calculated the amount 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.240
 planets that could theoretically be 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.880
 life zone 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.950
 areas around the star like the sun water 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.380
 on the surface of such planets are saved 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.750
 in a liquid state now goes big 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.240
 flow of work related discoveries 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:27.380
 ground tools and with work 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:29.660
 satellites today exoplanet planet 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.670
 outside the solar system open up almost 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.039
 every month 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:37.280
 exoplanet found in 1988 in 

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:39.549
 constellation Cepheus has two suns star 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.049
 around which she turns double 

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:44.749
 spectrometry main search method 

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:45.920
 the planets turning around the star 

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:47.749
 shakes it 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.569
 and we can observe the shift of the spectrum 

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:53.929
 stars many planets open thanks 

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:56.089
 transit method distance to even 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:59.510
 the nearest stars are very big and 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:01.159
 distinguish the planet against the star with 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.709
 using very large telescope systems 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:06.880
 With adaptive optics it is possible recently 

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:09.439
 this is the first such picture was received 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.299
 discovery of the first extrasolar planets 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:13.670
 one of the biggest scientific achievements 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.920
 of the last century today it is not only 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.890
 search brothers on reason but separately 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.149
 modern astronomy section 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.759
 searching for exoplanets will allow to build 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:24.649
 periodic table of planetary systems and 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:27.200
 classify them by features 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:29.749
 orbits we finally understand how much 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.759
 uniquely our solar system and which 

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:33.920
 the processes led to the formation of planets 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.560
 It turned out that many blanks are 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.299
 existed which were based on 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.390
 that the solar system is very typical they 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.460
 proved to be wrong and need to explain everything 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.899
 variety of systems that we see 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.119
 need to explain these hot Jupiter 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:50.450
 need to explain the planet on some 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.280
 very strange orbit, scientists have found 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.649
 thirds of all temperature stars like u 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.259
 the sun must be at least one 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:00.100
 earthly candidate for life 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:02.659
 hundreds of planets found 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.149
 only in our galaxy the milky way 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.490
 the number of exoplanet is estimated at 50 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.470
 billions of which are inhabited can 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.989
 be two billion among the open 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.360
 astronomers of the planet ocean constellation 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.549
 Ophiuchus coin in the constellation scorpion 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.440
 which rotate against their movement 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:21.349
 stars and the whole planetary system 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.370
 big dipper constellation looks like 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.190
 our sunny 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.290
 even if for some reason we were 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.000
 I am sure that nowhere is the planet similar to 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.280
 earth anyway research would be 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.140
 very interesting you can explore let's say 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.840
 neutron stars or black holes or 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.620
 something else understand what galaxies 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.720
 that nobody lives there scientists are optimists 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.400
 claim inhabited planet will find 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.049
 earlier than humanity go to 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.569
 Mars does not have long to wait 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:51.069
 dates and plowed finds planned for 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.069
 mid 21st century
