00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:08.380
 Hello dear friends with you and okran 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:11.360
 and today we continue the epic video by 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.700
 kv-1s it was my second tank battle 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.219
 you could see the first fight on u tube 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.890
 if not seen then look in the past 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.500
 video recordings and this map 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:26.720
 fisherman they are not fishing bay my God 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:28.849
 these are fjords here at this place very very 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.609
 vantage point is on the center behind the stone 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:35.840
 but as we see here a firefly passes by 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:37.550
 and can enlighten our whole position but 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.940
 nothing terrible we become in this 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:44.180
 bush and shine completely moving to 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.280
 mostly and well players are rather inexperienced 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.930
 driving along this road they 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:53.810
 bottom and so easy and possible from inviza 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:56.030
 crammed in the side so to speak as we eat 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.950
 In this case, well, in principle, on the fifth 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.220
 the level of battles in the sixth little experienced 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:03.170
 players usually and many go just 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.620
 this central road and and excellent 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.990
 glow from a given stone and naturally 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.020
 after the shot we are sharply sharply 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.550
 drive off a given house that is, we do not 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.840
 We become in other then skate because 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.270
 that we can easily snap off the art 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.100
 who here throws everywhere and therefore 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.050
 we immediately roll back to this house 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.430
 wait about 10 seconds to try 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:29.180
 lighten well well i mean it is just when u 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.310
 kvass 13 seconds 10 seconds already we are gone 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.840
 that is, almost as soon as from k to 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.840
 immediately decided to start leaving 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:45.190
 that is, here we go and no longer 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:49.530
 we shine and not shone and we try 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:52.000
 here is the opponent throw 421 efficiency 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.890
 it is natural that the gun at the class is very 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.670
 very powerful enough but not that 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:00.520
 exactly but not so helmets and breakdowns 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.610
 175 millimeters is more than enough for everything 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.770
 tanks absolutely well if of course in 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.020
 abnormal zone in the forehead kvass you do not 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:13.120
 you will get so in principle all punches 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:16.060
 Myself with particular problems. I already understand. 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.510
 that the center is nothing special to catch but 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.750
 center for precisely this stone not trying 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.630
 move here to the shelf where we are 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:30.670
 We see a lot of different small and with ltshek 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:32.650
 pawns that is our damage here enough 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.530
 to kill half the opponents 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.270
 just with one shot 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:41.340
 that is, there are no problems at all, but here we are 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:43.480
 meet the Chinese, I understand what I mean 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.100
 crossfire and that is from all 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.880
 parties now start shooting at me i'm 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.670
 I get 34 soviet shot 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.300
 here what give for t34 i am from one shot 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:58.500
 won't take 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:01.060
 so I give damage and not trying somehow 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.440
 quickly dive down at least to 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.610
 I did not shoot from the center 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.350
 typo3 34 has a recharge of 2 seconds. 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.320
 that is, we have very, very good 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:14.470
 quickly lucky that art is only 14 x p 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.209
 demolish us and because of my 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.130
 a very very long reload I'm still 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.930
 I take him away but I lose him 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:24.640
 almost everyone and see how much 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:27.160
 time for me passed hit well nothing i 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:32.340
 not discouraged in principle this is only three 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:35.549
 fraga score 88 and I have 193 kb 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.680
 but by the way, I even panicked a little 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:40.989
 I thought that this is all there is likely 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.470
 hoping for allies hope too 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.489
 especially 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.830
 can we see su-26 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.299
 pick it up and by the way cut there hepe 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.099
 in principle, many take it away 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.349
 vanshot unlike how it is 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:57.030
 before with small tanks on it is necessary 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:59.349
 there were several times to get in and here 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:04.090
 little french art tried too 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:07.599
 run away but no I caught her and was again 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:13.109
 wonderful square-1 and we shoot him 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:13.109
 caterpillar without damage well, anything can happen 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:20.350
 like 190 x I left I 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.600
 arrived at the base where than half of the enemies 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.919
 was alive and yet it is already the seventh 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:30.720
 frag ie I have 2 left 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:33.400
 armor-piercing projectile and kvass on the center 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.500
 instantly flies away to the hangar from my 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.510
 shots from what we see 1 and 2 will be on 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.580
 kvass, and already such satisfied good 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:44.680
 performance is 8 frags this steel 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:46.450
 the wall is a sniper this is a warrior that is 1890 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.250
 experience is not so much well because 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.620
 goals we had a little liv but all 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:54.400
 same as we see to you in the top just 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:56.289
 breaks in fact random so 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.030
 friends follow my other videos don't 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:59.889
 I know about the class will be another class 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.320
 video but I hope so now unfortunately 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:04.000
 you have to farm on the taipa and basically 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.669
 everyone would be interesting to pass on that 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.160
 because you need loans 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:10.720
 and so in general subscribe to the channel 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.300
 youtube and join the group VKontakte 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.770
 see my stream on tviche all links 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.770
 in the description and good luck in randomness
