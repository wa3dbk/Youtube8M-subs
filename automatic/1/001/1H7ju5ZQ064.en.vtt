a<00:00:08.320> surfing<00:00:08.980> it's<00:00:09.580> given<00:00:09.969> me<00:00:10.000> a<00:00:10.120> whole

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:10.240 
a surfing it's given me a whole

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.810 
a surfing it's given me a whole
different<00:00:10.930> experience<00:00:11.500> of<00:00:12.070> being<00:00:12.219> in<00:00:12.340> water<00:00:12.519> I

different experience of being in water I

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
different experience of being in water I
started<00:00:13.690> surfing<00:00:13.870> with<00:00:14.139> African<00:00:14.620> skies<00:00:14.950> and

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:15.840 
started surfing with African skies and

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.029 
started surfing with African skies and
it's<00:00:16.840> been<00:00:17.169> quite<00:00:17.349> terrifying

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:18.039 
it's been quite terrifying

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.120 
it's been quite terrifying
initially<00:00:19.110> because<00:00:20.110> I'd<00:00:20.289> get<00:00:20.470> out<00:00:20.619> there<00:00:20.890> and

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130 
initially because I'd get out there and

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.810 
initially because I'd get out there and
they'd<00:00:21.220> look<00:00:21.430> at<00:00:21.550> me<00:00:21.609> and<00:00:21.730> go<00:00:21.910> hi<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:23.699> then<00:00:24.699> you

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820 
they'd look at me and go hi and then you

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.150 
they'd look at me and go hi and then you
just<00:00:25.060> think<00:00:25.330> are<00:00:25.630> they<00:00:26.380> greeting<00:00:26.740> me<00:00:26.920> or

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
just think are they greeting me or

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.230 
just think are they greeting me or
warning<00:00:27.939> me

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
warning me

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.790 
warning me
and<00:00:28.509> then<00:00:28.779> I<00:00:28.810> once<00:00:29.140> went<00:00:29.349> out<00:00:29.500> with<00:00:29.560> a

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
and then I once went out with a

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.950 
and then I once went out with a
Frenchman<00:00:30.220> and<00:00:30.550> that<00:00:30.820> was<00:00:31.029> awful<00:00:31.359> cuz<00:00:31.539> we<00:00:31.689> lost

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
Frenchman and that was awful cuz we lost

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:32.460 
Frenchman and that was awful cuz we lost
him<00:00:32.169> eeeh

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:32.470 
him eeeh

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.530 
him eeeh
and<00:00:32.559> then<00:00:33.040> I<00:00:33.129> started<00:00:33.489> shouting<00:00:33.970> for<00:00:34.449> him

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
and then I started shouting for him

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.119 
and then I started shouting for him
which<00:00:34.720> was<00:00:34.930> a<00:00:34.960> bad<00:00:35.199> idea<00:00:35.230> because<00:00:35.589> I<00:00:35.830> was<00:00:35.949> like

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:36.129 
which was a bad idea because I was like

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:40.829 
which was a bad idea because I was like
Jacques<00:00:36.780> Jacques<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:39.489> I<00:00:39.879> was<00:00:40.000> unpopular<00:00:40.360> for

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:40.839 
Jacques Jacques and I was unpopular for

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:43.380 
Jacques Jacques and I was unpopular for
a<00:00:40.870> long<00:00:41.080> time<00:00:41.320> out<00:00:41.589> of<00:00:41.799> muizenberg<00:00:42.309> so<00:00:43.210> that's

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
a long time out of muizenberg so that's

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.609 
a long time out of muizenberg so that's
that's<00:00:43.690> that's<00:00:44.049> been<00:00:44.320> an<00:00:44.470> amazing<00:00:44.860> experiment

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:46.619 
that's that's been an amazing experiment

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:49.020 
that's that's been an amazing experiment
but<00:00:47.619> I<00:00:47.680> think<00:00:48.010> if<00:00:48.129> you<00:00:48.250> treat<00:00:48.489> the<00:00:48.610> ocean<00:00:48.909> with

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
but I think if you treat the ocean with

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.490 
but I think if you treat the ocean with
respect<00:00:49.479> that's<00:00:49.659> the<00:00:49.839> main<00:00:50.019> thing<00:00:50.229> and<00:00:50.409> that's

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
respect that's the main thing and that's

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.410 
respect that's the main thing and that's
that's<00:00:50.890> why<00:00:51.129> we<00:00:51.280> need<00:00:51.430> to<00:00:51.549> respect<00:00:51.909> our<00:00:52.150> water

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
that's why we need to respect our water

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.350 
that's why we need to respect our water
what<00:00:53.110> do<00:00:53.229> we<00:00:53.379> do<00:00:53.650> that<00:00:53.949> water<00:00:54.190> what<00:00:54.760> our<00:00:55.030> bodies

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
what do we do that water what our bodies

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.479 
what do we do that water what our bodies
do<00:00:55.540> without<00:00:55.780> water<00:00:56.080> as<00:00:56.320> as<00:00:56.769> well<00:00:57.040> as<00:00:57.220> all<00:00:57.369> the

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
do without water as as well as all the

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.100 
do without water as as well as all the
people<00:00:57.519> in<00:00:57.879> Kaimuki<00:00:58.119> and<00:00:58.479> Murdoch<00:00:58.780> who<00:00:58.930> won't

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
people in Kaimuki and Murdoch who won't

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.619 
people in Kaimuki and Murdoch who won't
be<00:00:59.229> able<00:00:59.350> to<00:00:59.470> have<00:00:59.650> water<00:00:59.920> but<00:01:00.250> I<00:01:03.420> think<00:01:04.420> that

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
be able to have water but I think that

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.210 
be able to have water but I think that
Jacob<00:01:04.960> Zuma<00:01:05.290> could<00:01:05.470> do<00:01:05.619> really<00:01:05.950> do<00:01:06.100> a<00:01:06.130> lot

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
Jacob Zuma could do really do a lot

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.719 
Jacob Zuma could do really do a lot
particularly<00:01:06.930> around<00:01:08.460> promoting<00:01:09.460> the<00:01:09.579> use<00:01:09.609> of

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
particularly around promoting the use of

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.279 
particularly around promoting the use of
the<00:01:09.969> shower<00:01:10.210> and<00:01:11.159> instead<00:01:12.159> of<00:01:12.280> the<00:01:12.369> bath<00:01:12.609> I

00:01:13.279 --> 00:01:13.289 
the shower and instead of the bath I

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:15.660 
the shower and instead of the bath I
really<00:01:14.289> think<00:01:14.590> there's<00:01:14.770> a<00:01:14.859> massive<00:01:15.039> impact<00:01:15.310> he

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
really think there's a massive impact he

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.950 
really think there's a massive impact he
can<00:01:15.880> make<00:01:16.060> great<00:01:16.689> water<00:01:16.960> particularly<00:01:17.670> I

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
can make great water particularly I

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.800 
can make great water particularly I
think<00:01:19.960> is<00:01:20.109> a<00:01:20.140> wonderful<00:01:20.979> thing<00:01:21.490> to<00:01:21.549> to<00:01:22.390> take<00:01:22.600> on

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
think is a wonderful thing to to take on

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.620 
think is a wonderful thing to to take on
and<00:01:23.409> I<00:01:23.469> encourage<00:01:23.829> the<00:01:23.979> people<00:01:24.130> up<00:01:24.399> there<00:01:24.640> to

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
and I encourage the people up there to

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.989 
and I encourage the people up there to
collect<00:01:25.960> the<00:01:26.289> water<00:01:26.439> from<00:01:26.859> your<00:01:27.039> gutters<00:01:27.549> from

a<00:01:36.850> little<00:01:37.060> arose<00:01:37.420> that's<00:01:37.869> what<00:01:38.109> that's<00:01:38.319> what

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
a little arose that's what that's what

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:40.169 
a little arose that's what that's what
I've<00:01:38.530> discovered<00:01:38.920> a<00:01:39.130> little<00:01:39.249> secret<00:01:39.640> tip<00:01:39.909> for

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:40.179 
I've discovered a little secret tip for

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:42.749 
I've discovered a little secret tip for
me<00:01:40.299> add<00:01:40.539> a<00:01:41.170> rose<00:01:41.380> and<00:01:41.560> then<00:01:42.039> it<00:01:42.159> actually<00:01:42.490> looks

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
me add a rose and then it actually looks

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.550 
me add a rose and then it actually looks
a<00:01:42.880> bit<00:01:42.909> like<00:01:43.200> clip<00:01:44.200> drift

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
a bit like clip drift

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.669 
a bit like clip drift
and<00:01:45.210> then<00:01:46.210> actually<00:01:46.780> what<00:01:46.899> I<00:01:46.929> found<00:01:47.140> is<00:01:47.350> if<00:01:47.499> you

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:47.679 
and then actually what I found is if you

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:50.010 
and then actually what I found is if you
add<00:01:47.920> a<00:01:48.219> little<00:01:48.579> bit<00:01:48.700> of<00:01:48.789> clip<00:01:49.060> drift<00:01:49.329> then<00:01:49.869> it

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
add a little bit of clip drift then it

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.139 
add a little bit of clip drift then it
actually<00:01:50.200> tastes<00:01:50.740> a<00:01:50.799> lot<00:01:50.920> like<00:01:50.979> clip<00:01:51.880> drift

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
actually tastes a lot like clip drift

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.389 
actually tastes a lot like clip drift
and<00:01:52.359> then<00:01:52.810> after<00:01:53.139> two<00:01:53.319> or<00:01:53.469> three<00:01:53.499> who<00:01:53.889> cares<00:01:54.159> if

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
and then after two or three who cares if

00:01:54.399 --> 00:02:01.410 
and then after two or three who cares if
the<00:01:55.299> kids<00:01:55.509> pissed<00:01:56.109> in<00:01:56.350> the<00:01:56.409> path<00:01:59.999> in<00:02:00.999> fact<00:02:01.270> I'd

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
the kids pissed in the path in fact I'd

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.649 
the kids pissed in the path in fact I'd
like<00:02:01.569> to<00:02:01.719> quote<00:02:01.929> the<00:02:02.350> Archbishop<00:02:02.889> Tutu<00:02:03.659> who

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659
