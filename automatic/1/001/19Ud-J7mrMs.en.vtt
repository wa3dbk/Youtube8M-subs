00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.240 
tired of just doing normal twists so I
started<00:01:58.300> doing<00:01:58.420> this<00:01:58.690> and<00:01:59.070> sometimes<00:02:00.070> it

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
started doing this and sometimes it

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.310 
started doing this and sometimes it
takes<00:02:00.460> me<00:02:00.640> less<00:02:01.149> than<00:02:01.420> a<00:02:01.479> minute<00:02:01.780> to<00:02:01.810> just<00:02:02.110> flip

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
takes me less than a minute to just flip

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.139 
takes me less than a minute to just flip
it<00:02:02.440> all<00:02:02.560> together<00:02:02.740> and<00:02:03.190> then<00:02:03.340> I'm<00:02:03.430> good<00:02:03.700> and<00:02:03.970> it

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
it all together and then I'm good and it

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:06.300 
it all together and then I'm good and it
looks<00:02:04.360> really<00:02:04.659> neat<00:02:04.990> and<00:02:05.290> at<00:02:05.560> first<00:02:05.740> glance<00:02:05.890> it

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
looks really neat and at first glance it

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.859 
looks really neat and at first glance it
looks<00:02:06.550> like<00:02:06.729> you<00:02:06.880> braided<00:02:07.270> it<00:02:07.390> and<00:02:07.600> you<00:02:07.720> took

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
looks like you braided it and you took

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.229 
looks like you braided it and you took
some<00:02:08.110> time<00:02:08.140> on<00:02:08.530> it<00:02:08.679> even<00:02:09.369> though<00:02:09.580> you<00:02:09.640> did<00:02:10.090> it

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
some time on it even though you did it

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.360 
some time on it even though you did it
it's<00:02:10.810> a<00:02:10.869> great<00:02:11.110> little<00:02:11.380> shortcut<00:02:11.860> if<00:02:12.069> you
