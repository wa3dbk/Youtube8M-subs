much<00:05:09.800> beef<00:05:10.130> so<00:05:10.400> I'm<00:05:10.520> using<00:05:10.729> bison<00:05:11.620> it's<00:05:12.620> a

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
much beef so I'm using bison it's a

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.290 
much beef so I'm using bison it's a
clean<00:05:12.919> the<00:05:13.130> cleanest<00:05:13.520> former<00:05:13.850> red<00:05:14.060> meat<00:05:14.270> i

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
clean the cleanest former red meat i

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.390 
clean the cleanest former red meat i
think<00:05:14.630> i<00:05:14.900> think<00:05:14.960> oestrogen<00:05:15.830> kangaroo<00:05:16.280> is

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
think i think oestrogen kangaroo is

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.890 
think i think oestrogen kangaroo is
probably<00:05:16.640> a<00:05:16.700> little<00:05:16.820> cleaner<00:05:17.120> but<00:05:17.360> that's

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
probably a little cleaner but that's

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.570 
probably a little cleaner but that's
hard<00:05:18.080> to<00:05:18.169> come<00:05:18.320> by<00:05:18.470> in<00:05:18.500> America<00:05:18.979> so<00:05:19.220> I<00:05:19.400> mean

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
hard to come by in America so I mean

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.400 
hard to come by in America so I mean
bison<00:05:20.060> probably<00:05:20.510> three<00:05:20.690> times<00:05:20.840> a<00:05:21.050> day<00:05:21.080> and

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
bison probably three times a day and

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.310 
bison probably three times a day and
then<00:05:22.040> chicken<00:05:22.490> and<00:05:22.610> fish<00:05:22.760> sparingly<00:05:23.419> fish<00:05:24.200> is

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
then chicken and fish sparingly fish is

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.290 
then chicken and fish sparingly fish is
the<00:05:24.440> worst<00:05:24.650> but<00:05:25.040> I<00:05:25.220> do<00:05:25.310> crave<00:05:25.700> to<00:05:25.729> and<00:05:26.060> out<00:05:26.180> of
