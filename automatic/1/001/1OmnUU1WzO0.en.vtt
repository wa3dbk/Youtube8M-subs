is very important to get in the game on

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.009 
is very important to get in the game on
it<00:03:33.100> probably<00:03:33.940> one<00:03:34.090> of<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:34.239> most<00:03:34.390> important

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
it probably one of the most important

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.229 
it probably one of the most important
steps<00:03:35.290> because<00:03:35.920> it's<00:03:36.430> the<00:03:36.519> stuff<00:03:36.790> that's<00:03:37.000> most

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
steps because it's the stuff that's most

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.300 
steps because it's the stuff that's most
often<00:03:37.540> pass<00:03:38.109> by<00:03:38.440> when<00:03:38.739> people<00:03:39.010> are<00:03:39.070> trying<00:03:39.250> to
