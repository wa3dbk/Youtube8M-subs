00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.610
 hello everyone in this video I bring you the 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.960
 mount ruins and good we are as 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.480
 says its name adds ruins 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.090
 structures or constructions like 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.769
 you wanted to say these ruins go 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.080
 appearing laterally throughout your 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.660
 world as in this is one of the ruins 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.760
 that the mod is added and also how 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.650
 integrate a block that are these and 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.690
 carmen da come with a chest 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.610
 that yesterday times that you can touch like 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.040
 this emptiness or they can touch you sometimes 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.780
 very good things diamond buttons 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.210
 or are we the truth I do not know how much 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.710
 ruin adds so it will be giving 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.110
 contributions while finding the 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.539
 different ruins so see you and 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.030
 good as in around here I found others from 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.399
 these structures as well is with 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.770
 new blocks and as you see here and a chest 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.649
 and this chest carries a shovel 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.780
 diamond and a wooden sword that does not 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.460
 it's wrong it's for the good here 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.589
 As you can see, there is another type of end that 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.690
 is there stone moss stone 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.840
 normal that also carries a chest 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.480
 it's empty I said you can touch some 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.270
 empty cafes like we can have 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.060
 good things around here not so far 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.580
 I find another one that is a bit like 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.770
 the one there but it would be with stone to see 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.870
 let's see what has a good vacuum so 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.510
 let's go to the base good as in here 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.670
 is another one of the ruins or structures 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.490
 can here down is the chest I'm going to 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.400
 try to open it break this and good 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.840
 let's see what it has with the vacuum as 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.240
 It depends on the luck you do not have 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.280
 Sometimes you play empty or with good things 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.440
 so go find more ruins so 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.780
 see you when I agree that you are going to 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.820
 find another one that is very similar to 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.950
 previous but this is like a little more 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.170
 big and that you do or more seriousness and 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.729
 well it's normal to give you the expenses to the 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.979
 once you are generating all these 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.660
 structures because it is good to regenerate 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.060
 and it causes you a lot now but at the end 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.550
 in general it is taken and believed normal and 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.260
 good as in the one that was empty like that 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.570
 that we will not see another ruin that 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.330
 I just found this island and this one 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.580
 just regenerate or generate I do not know how 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.870
 it says good let's see this one if you have 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.060
 a chest and as in order 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.970
 yes I want let's see what has to see 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.280
 and good to see this has a gold helmet 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.989
 that's not bad today we're going to see 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.700
 is I do not know what it is that has down is 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.860
 as another structure to see we are going to 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.470
 look for the chest of here good to see here 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.690
 is the chest and that has to see how 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.970
 it's empty algorithms try to enter 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:38.019
 we apply to keep going down and good young 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:40.870
 over here it's like stronghold type that 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:43.349
 low let's see what's in here and 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.760
 good to see is how well estrogen - like 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:48.819
 if what they do not know is the work is 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.709
 where is the portal of the dragon in pt 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.620
 let's see that in this as I 'm going to 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.090
 put on your rival and like in this chest 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.530
 I was like this when they eat here here goes 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.060
 to find another ruin that was just 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:04.659
 regenerate after coming down from there and it's 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:07.030
 like the house are generating more 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:09.340
 so how in this is how it's like 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.500
 from something and comments full of new 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.989
 blocks that are very good I like them 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.090
 these blocks and they will see how it is removed 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:19.030
 a chest and like others and again what 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.330
 lucky I have but not all with all 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.460
 the functions 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.980
 Not only this is a matter of luck 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.330
 if you cover me not and so let's go 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.560
 keep looking for more ruins so 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.380
 we come back good here you will find 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.540
 is also what I think is the one of 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.150
 pyramid were the only ones that 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.890
 generate in the desert area and how 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.780
 come here has a chest and in between 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.690
 here and lava so I will try to give 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.640
 here and see and how it is empty but I think 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.790
 that just generated one let's see 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.610
 what does he have to see if he is wearing something and 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.980
 is that we were going lava and we opened it and with 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.260
 the empty good as I was saying is 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.970
 all empty poor is not a bug 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
 none of that is a matter of luck and 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.820
 good and so much to finally seek 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.350
 I found this structure of the ship that 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.480
 I had been looking for it for a while now, so 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.550
 here it is and how another stream appears 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.920
 that we are going to see both and they seemed to me 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.740
 enough of these that I think if 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.150
 it is only regenerated by the ocean today 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.970
 let's go see some also to see 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.620
 they have and how on this boat does not have 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.720
 nothing so let's go see the other and 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.630
 as he catches he wears iron boots 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.520
 and a melon or watermelon and once we go to 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.190
 see that they carry these foods for 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.110
 end something perfect and like emptiness no no 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.300
 videos not end until he found me in 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.640
 this one so let's continue to see if 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.010
 I was finally going to a gold shirt 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.900
 and a bed ready as if it touches is 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.630
 matter of luck and catch while you 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.430
 you are walking around your map will go 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.900
 appearing all these structures as 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.520
 since there are others that we have already 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.740
 shown long ago we do requires 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.120
 texture by the blocks add in the 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.040
 obvious description just leave the post of the 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.900
 creator I will not let him download directly 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.000
 since the creator of the mountain could 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.470
 bother with me so I'll leave it the 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.140
 creative poster and you can 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.700
 expect it easily and the creator will leave 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.500
 the texture and the mold taste like 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.330
 just leave your like to comment and 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.830
 subscribe and see you in a next 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.830
 goodbye video
