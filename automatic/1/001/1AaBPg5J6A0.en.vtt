 which symbolizes san antonio we are going to 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.530
 move to the kitchen in which you are going 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.269

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.580
 have two options you can ask for the 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:18.370

 cayetano to never miss the bread and 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.480
 the work that would be good if you 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.519
 When you light the yellow candle the garment 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.799
 on a duckling near the tap of the 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:29.220
 tap so you have a little more of 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.220
 Energy 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.700
 let's go now to what would be the living 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:39.120
 dining room in the living room a candle 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.760
 blue color we are going to turn it on to san 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.640
 benito abad who was the greatest 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.530
 spiritualist of all times the san 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.780
 Benito to do exorcism to release 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.120
 of damage of hexes gives excellent 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.730
 results then in someone like 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.030
 let's light a blue candle too 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.620
 we follow the procedure of reading the 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.690
 prayer that is behind that of the 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.930
 cheat three times and ask the saint 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:08.430

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:11.130
 all the hexes the spells the 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.830
 envy the evils that someone wants 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.670
 throw him to his home that reveals that 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.800
 he took them out immediately 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.230
 let's imagine that we have in the 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.120
 address a garage then there we go to 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.180
 work with san cristóbal that would be the 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.130
 saint of the traveler we are going to light a 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.340
 white candle we also follow the 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.170
 procedure of the stampa we are going to 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.920
 light the candle and let's ask them to 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:38.500
 Cristóbal to protect that vehicle and 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.610
 the passengers that are going to be in the 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.930
 same 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.989
 we continue with 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.920
 a candle of san jorge to which the green 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:51.870
 white and red or red white and green like 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.420
 visualize more the trampitas of san 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.420
 jorge to ask for justice this is 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.280
 turn on in the bathroom this goes on in 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.900
 bathroom 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.370
 the one of transformers you have two or 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.990
 three neighborhoods will have to use two 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.120
 or three candles of course this goes by 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.120
 every bathroom a candle of san jorge 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.450
 let's imagine what the patio has 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.070
 that you have a laundry that you 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.220
 has a skewer they got a warehouse 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:20.680
 etcetera or that there is a corridor to a 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.240
 side of the house we're going to turn on a 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.990
 candle up on screen although the 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.990
 Verdiblanca 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.250
 we are going to ask for health and not 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:33.030
 accidents occur within the 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.460
 home also that protects 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.110
 everything that would be the furniture part and 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.480
 appliances because I tell myself this 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.240
 there are houses loaded the light is turned on and 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.610
 it burns out immediately the 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.320
 televisions alone burns the 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.200
 washing machine burns the refrigerator 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.970
 all it followed and perhaps you are not 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.920
 agree that this is due to a 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.230
 chance we could talk about 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.630
 causality then to see prevent 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:00.050
 all this san pantaleón in what would be 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.970
 the laundry or in the barbecue and so on 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:05.010
 these with regard to candles 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.350
 now let's move on to the olivera audios 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.960
 a list that you are going to buy in juan 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.030

 Esoteric items will sell you 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.980
 all sachets which are going to 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.960
 put in a dry glass and then it goes to 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.510
 burn in carboncito if it's going to go through 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.569
 the whole house 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:30.819
 the materials would be the incense 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:34.789
 look at the thorax benzoin aloe al 'míster' 

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:36.860
 sandalwood and drago blood all those 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:39.469

00:05:42.679 --> 00:05:48.770
 santería and with a flavor will happen 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:51.979
 all the smoke in the house 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:55.270
 the incense is worth after the 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:58.930
 fluid that adds as to pass the fluid 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:02.650
 let's record the fluid in a bucket 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:04.630
 You will put 5 liters of water going 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:08.200
 to add 40 drops of methylene blue 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:10.180
 who buys it in aquariums or vets 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.730

 floor cloth all the floors of the house 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:29.320
 if you encounter a 

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:30.880
 bedroom which has good carpet 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:34.330
 is going to put a disposable sprinkler and goes 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:37.510
 to spray the entire carpet with the rest 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.980
 of the liquid is going to throw it in the closure or 

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:41.110

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:43.690
 we have first we passed the liquid that 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:46.180
 the name and then we make the middle salt and 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:48.460
 we end up with candles for example in 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:50.740
 this case that would be sambenito for the 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.570

 appear below the screen 

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:02.669
 good
