00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.000
 hello want today 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:14.070
 show you how to BabyschÃ¼hchen strictly 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.360
 and then matted in the first video 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.550
 I showed you exactly how to do it 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.250
 train a house for the first time 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:25.080
 pont aven strictly and I have then 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:28.440
 I struck here 18 mesh 21 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.350
 knit rows then two stitches 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:35.790
 increased on the four meshes distributed 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:38.250
 then I knitted 14 in and then 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.220
 the top off until I fell on each one 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.949
 Strictly stock two more stitches we had 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.500
 pulled together and sewn the front 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:50.790
 is the backbone for our little ones 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:55.879
 slipper in the size 20 21 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:01:00.119
 and for that we need about 20 strictly 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:03.680
 strictly wool wash and felt from the 

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:06.510
 run length of 50 meters or just like that 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.030
 but it must be a ball of yarn 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.280
 have at least 75 meters running longer 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.240
 and now I show you as we do 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.219
 Crochet the edge trans crochet up here 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.689
 after knitting and so we tied a band 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:21.539
 can pull through then here are great 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.340
 holes and after felting we pull there 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:26.640
 a little ribbon with that on the foot 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.619
 holds out and now regulate the bunch above 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.149
 turn it on to pull the ribbon 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.890
 We can start at the back 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:36.119
 the 4 saw we sewn together 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:42.030
 have and crochet tight stitches on it 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:43.469
 sleep two air masses and 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:53.670
 now we know 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:57.450
 around 27 solid mesh a123 nice in 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.369
 the big holes in that we on 27 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.969
 are and back at the heel 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.969
 arrive 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:24.959
 26 27 then stitch in the first row 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:30.290
 to pull it back in to make two airs 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:30.290
 so now we are making six solid ones 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:46.519
 123456 and do a lot of air now 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.310
 1234 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.019
 and we close in the next 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.549
 solid mesh again that we have one 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.590
 have really big bend 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:58.170
 that's the big loop that is 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:15.180
 important now again six test stitches 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:19.140
 1 2346 and again much air mission 1234 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.459
 and again the next solid and that 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.410
 Let's do it until we get back in front 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.329
 arrived at the row where I am 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.040
 I have closed the series again 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.560
 they have our big loops and 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:33.989
 now comes a row one more 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:43.530
 Air mass on the six test meshes 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:47.489
 knit five now 12345 and now 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:50.700
 we make nails chopsticks an envelope 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:55.190
 in through two loops through the 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:04:07.609
 kick through two loops through the 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:07.609
 both 23 45 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.359
 66 chopsticks sleeping in the huge 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:26.389
 then we make five stitches again 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:31.900
 in between test 12345 and now again 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:48.590
 six chopsticks one chopstick two 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:50.330
 chopsticks three chopsticks 456 five again 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:05:00.320
 firm stitches and so we continue 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:05:02.270
 until the series is finished 12 and again 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.160
 our chopsticks after being in the 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.750
 last big loops our six 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.740
 we have gone in 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:12.740
 where if the first fixed machine 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:15.530
 loop take out this disconnect 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.360
 thread and pull necessarily again 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.030
 through this bend also through it 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.349
 that holds well and then sew the thread 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:25.669
 then we have this little one 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:29.270
 petal-legs to the above 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:35.690
 around and now I take mine 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:38.090
 puschel wants this in every shop 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:42.080
 which one can use no matter which 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:44.240
 color that is not felt wool that is 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.120
 a completely normal creative wool 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.669
 and then I go around and around 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.680
 the fixed mesh becomes two air masses 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:55.520
 at the beginning and knits around once 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:58.759
 each ash once again a firm stitch 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:03.800
 also the chopsticks so that's nice 

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:05.990
 nice cuddly in cuddly is one 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.710
 row around in every solid brand 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.710
 spoken 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:14.199
 never the rod over each bloom 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:21.380
 once the whole series through so now 

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:23.930
 I still have a number of this 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:26.240
 cuddly wool above it disgusts 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.130
 The threads must be sewn very well 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.720
 because this wool is not felted 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.550
 the stitches would rise again 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.280
 We'll do that in the washing machine now 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:38.770
 the two sort and that would be mostly 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:41.570
 easy 40 degrees with liquid care 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:43.100
 detergents or pesticides what 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:45.080
 you also have one at home 

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.330
 short program is enough and if the 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.830
 Vessels are let these two three days 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:52.010
 dry on a towel 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.750
 somewhere in the corner please do not on the 

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.220
 heating he does not want to do that well 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.740
 and then we move through this 

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:59.870
 spoon through this ridiculous one 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:02.360
 rich ribbon or what you have and 

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:04.460
 important is the ribbon at one 

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.560
 Make a good fix that the child 

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.910
 the ribbon is not alone from the 

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.130
 school sees if you are not careful 

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.510
 and it could be in the mouth 

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:13.880
 then become very dangerous because of that 

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:15.919
 I always take the principle 

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.360
 and you can slip them then 

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:18.050
 I can equip it again 

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.020
 demonstrate 

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:24.169
 and again two model examples that 

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:26.900
 crocheted it now with air masses 

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:30.199
 all around audi brazil wool is that and 

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:32.419
 These are so bear paw slippers all over 

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:35.090
 cuddly down non-slip equipped 

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:38.090
 with latex liquid and all the way up here 

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:41.570
 cuddly and one more idea and that 

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:46.159
 I felt it was spicy spice 

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:50.599
 different parts then a flower 

00:07:46.159 --> 00:07:53.120
 put in filled with natural 

00:07:50.599 --> 00:07:54.860
 things blues dried the lavender the 

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.630
 could also be very beautiful in 

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:58.729
 So the washing machine can be washed 

00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:01.070
 first knitted then filled and then 

00:07:58.729 --> 00:08:03.020
 felt that is also normal an idea 

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:04.789
 if someday I was at some point 

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:09.260
 I'll show you how 

00:08:04.789 --> 00:08:14.080
 You strictly and various ships 

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:14.080
 Thank you very much bye
