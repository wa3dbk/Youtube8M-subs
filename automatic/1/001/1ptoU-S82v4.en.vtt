now<00:02:34.360> to<00:02:34.450> get<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.810> alternator<00:02:35.290> out<00:02:35.530> it<00:02:35.800> is<00:02:36.130> in

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
now to get the alternator out it is in

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.250 
now to get the alternator out it is in
there<00:02:36.460> pretty<00:02:36.670> good<00:02:36.760> you<00:02:37.660> want<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:37.900> just<00:02:38.050> use<00:02:38.230> a

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
there pretty good you want to just use a

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.670 
there pretty good you want to just use a
pry<00:02:38.560> bar<00:02:38.730> pry<00:02:39.730> up<00:02:39.910> underneath<00:02:40.270> it<00:02:42.180> and

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
pry bar pry up underneath it and

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.730 
pry bar pry up underneath it and
eventually<00:02:44.680> it<00:02:45.250> will<00:02:45.520> break<00:02:45.850> free<00:02:46.120> from<00:02:46.210> there

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
eventually it will break free from there

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.650 
eventually it will break free from there
see<00:02:47.740> he's<00:02:47.890> got<00:02:48.070> that<00:02:48.220> side<00:02:48.520> walk<00:02:49.300> around<00:02:49.570> to

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
see he's got that side walk around to

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:56.550 
see he's got that side walk around to
the<00:02:49.720> other<00:02:49.870> side<00:02:50.310> right<00:02:51.310> that<00:02:51.580> side<00:02:55.380> once<00:02:56.380> it's

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
the other side right that side once it's

and to help out you can see is using a

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.210 
and to help out you can see is using a
flat<00:04:32.810> blade<00:04:33.050> screwdriver<00:04:33.350> in<00:04:33.800> the<00:04:33.920> hole<00:04:33.950> to

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
flat blade screwdriver in the hole to

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.040 
flat blade screwdriver in the hole to
try<00:04:34.370> to<00:04:34.460> pry<00:04:34.760> it<00:04:34.820> downwards<00:04:35.360> a<00:04:35.480> little<00:04:35.720> bit<00:04:35.870> and

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
try to pry it downwards a little bit and

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.380 
try to pry it downwards a little bit and
enough<00:04:39.050> moving<00:04:39.800> around<00:04:40.070> eventually<00:04:40.940> you<00:04:41.270> will

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
enough moving around eventually you will

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.850 
enough moving around eventually you will
get<00:04:41.540> it<00:04:41.690> into<00:04:42.230> a<00:04:42.260> spot<00:04:42.560> where<00:04:42.590> you<00:04:42.770> can

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
get it into a spot where you can

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.840 
get it into a spot where you can
actually<00:04:43.100> get<00:04:43.490> a<00:04:43.760> bolt<00:04:44.690> in<00:04:44.780> there<00:04:45.280> does<00:04:46.280> take<00:04:46.580> a

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
actually get a bolt in there does take a

00:04:46.850 --> 00:05:04.749 
actually get a bolt in there does take a
little<00:04:47.180> bit<00:04:47.330> of<00:04:47.450> time<00:04:47.660> but<00:04:48.590> it<00:04:48.860> will<00:04:49.010> go

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:04.759 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:07.010 

once<00:05:05.759> you<00:05:05.910> get<00:05:06.030> one<00:05:06.240> bolt<00:05:06.419> in<00:05:06.569> there

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
once you get one bolt in there

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.200 
once you get one bolt in there
you<00:05:07.169> can<00:05:07.349> now<00:05:07.470> pry<00:05:07.800> from<00:05:07.830> that<00:05:08.280> side<00:05:08.580> and<00:05:08.880> it'll

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
you can now pry from that side and it'll

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.909 
you can now pry from that side and it'll
line<00:05:09.599> up<00:05:09.750> the<00:05:09.900> hole<00:05:10.050> on<00:05:10.199> the<00:05:10.229> other<00:05:10.410> side<00:05:10.710> so

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 
line up the hole on the other side so

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:19.870 
line up the hole on the other side so
you<00:05:10.949> can<00:05:11.130> push<00:05:11.310> that<00:05:11.490> bolt<00:05:11.729> in<00:05:11.849> as<00:05:11.970> well<00:05:18.289> and

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
you can push that bolt in as well and
