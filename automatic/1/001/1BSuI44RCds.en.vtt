00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.870
 yes 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.680
 since the mid-90s again the 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:18.020
 Latin American countries intensify the 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.570
 extraction of raw materials increasing 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.849
 well the exports the demand grows 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.860
 in industrialized countries 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:27.790
 traditional and especially in china this 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.790
 makes prices go up 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.570
 the countries with left governments 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.220
 take the opportunity to intensify 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.130
 control over the exploitation of 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.770
 resources 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.560
 with the additional income they fund 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.450
 and social development programs this 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.850
 economic model is called neo 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.640
 extractivism a model in which more 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.260
 people have access to education and 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.350
 improvements are observed in the system 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.890
 health the indices of extreme poverty in 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:02.500
 the affected countries decreased in a 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.500
 50% up to here a success story 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.250
 but it is a model that unfortunately 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.560
 caused a negative impact on the 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.050
 environment society and scope 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.150
 political because dependence increases 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.400
 of the states and therefore that of their 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.740
 social programs in front of the market 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.960
 international and the prices that this 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.210
 imposes the intensive exploitation of 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.840
 raw materials such as mining and 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.850
 Hydrocarbons harm ecosystems 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.560
 Latin American deforestation for 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.930
 soybean plantations and production 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.869
 Livestock destroys ecosystems 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.080
 natural biodiversity suffers a 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:41.360
 recession the use of pesticides contaminates 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.759
 the water the air and the floors the 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.050
 livestock emits large quantities of 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.570
 methane harmful to the climate 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.970
 this change also affects the 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.250
 inhabitants of these regions both 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.680
 companies like governments ignore their 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.140
 rights to the land by forcing them to a 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.570
 forced displacement the population 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.790
 local loses its source of income and for 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.610
 Thus the basis of their livelihood 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.070
 pollution also causes a 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.640
 worsening of health increase the 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.130
 diseases 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.140
 who criticizes the neo extractivism not what 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.690
 It has easy critics model 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.270
 economic extractivist are quickly 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.790
 qualified as enemies of change 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.040
 social this leads to activists 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.520
 environmental and human rights 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.950
 are increasingly marginalized in addition 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.959
 fundamental rights are lost 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.450
 democratic participation at 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.550
 strengthen the central power diminish 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.459
 opportunities for participation 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.860
 local level often parliaments 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.080
 nationals lose influence at the time 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.430
 that increases the central power every time 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.920
 more decisions are imposed 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.220
 governmental absolutely 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.890
 vertical takes advantage of the rivalry between 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.190
 the presumed interests of the majority and 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:01.070
 the interests of minorities 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:04.250
 however the causes of the trends 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:06.980
 negative ones do not reside exclusively in 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.710
 america latin 'the responsible are 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.840
 especially the countries of the global north and 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.610
 the emerging as china its 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.570
 behavior as producers and 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.360
 consumers 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.400
 it is the main engine of destruction 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.280
 global environment and 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.140
 social systems that's why they should 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.410
 develop alternatives at the level 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.990
 world is looking for an economic model 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.630
 viable a model that operates so 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:36.910
 Respectful with resources and prioritize 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.910
 ecological and social justice 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.660
