00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.319 
that plus 5 and then he's got 90 hand I
that's<00:01:58.469> got<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.649> plus<00:01:58.860> 5<00:01:59.009> boost<00:01:59.280> as<00:01:59.430> well<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.820> in

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
that's got a plus 5 boost as well and in

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.050 
that's got a plus 5 boost as well and in
the<00:02:00.420> offensive<00:02:00.810> awareness<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.530> 80<00:02:02.060> passings

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
the offensive awareness is 80 passings

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.700 
the offensive awareness is 80 passings
87<00:02:04.189> puck<00:02:05.189> control<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.700> 88<00:02:06.170> slap<00:02:07.170> shot<00:02:07.380> accuracy

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
87 puck control is 88 slap shot accuracy

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.440 
87 puck control is 88 slap shot accuracy
he<00:02:08.160> only<00:02:08.310> put<00:02:08.580> one<00:02:09.440> extra<00:02:10.790> point<00:02:11.790> on<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:12.120> that

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
he only put one extra point on that that

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.730 
he only put one extra point on that that
was<00:02:12.599> a<00:02:12.629> leftover<00:02:13.110> point<00:02:13.440> so

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
was a leftover point so

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.040 
was a leftover point so
he<00:02:14.130> puts<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:14.490> on<00:02:14.580> that<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:15.030> then<00:02:15.150> wrist<00:02:15.900> shot

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
he puts it on that and then wrist shot

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.980 
he puts it on that and then wrist shot
accuracy<00:02:16.350> is<00:02:16.620> 90<00:02:17.070> and<00:02:17.250> rashad<00:02:17.820> power<00:02:18.000> is<00:02:18.210> 83<00:02:18.780> so

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
accuracy is 90 and rashad power is 83 so

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.170 
accuracy is 90 and rashad power is 83 so
that<00:02:19.290> 90<00:02:20.070> wrist<00:02:20.220> shot<00:02:20.340> accuracy<00:02:20.640> is<00:02:20.910> wearing

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
speed is a 91 that's where that plus 9

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.950

comes<00:03:11.010> into<00:03:11.190> play<00:03:11.370> he<00:03:11.610> can<00:03:11.790> it<00:03:12.330> really<00:03:12.510> maxes

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
comes into play he can it really maxes

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.960 
comes into play he can it really maxes
out<00:03:13.050> at<00:03:13.110> an<00:03:13.350> 82<00:03:13.710> but<00:03:13.920> with<00:03:14.040> plus<00:03:14.220> 9<00:03:14.460> it<00:03:14.610> ends<00:03:14.880> up

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
out at an 82 but with plus 9 it ends up

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.170 
out at an 82 but with plus 9 it ends up
at<00:03:15.120> 91<00:03:15.660> and<00:03:15.870> then<00:03:16.560> strength<00:03:17.040> is<00:03:17.220> 73<00:03:17.820> strength

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
at 91 and then strength is 73 strength

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.180 
at 91 and then strength is 73 strength
really<00:03:18.450> helps<00:03:18.660> with<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.840> slat<00:03:19.410> I<00:03:19.590> wrist<00:03:19.980> shot

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
really helps with the slat I wrist shot

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.170 
really helps with the slat I wrist shot
or<00:03:20.730> shot<00:03:21.210> power<00:03:21.480> in<00:03:21.720> general<00:03:22.170> and<00:03:23.180> resistance

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
or shot power in general and resistance

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.810 
or shot power in general and resistance
two<00:03:24.360> hits<00:03:24.600> and<00:03:24.810> stuff<00:03:24.990> like<00:03:25.110> that<00:03:25.430> so<00:03:26.430> I<00:03:26.490> think

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
two hits and stuff like that so I think

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.420 
two hits and stuff like that so I think
he<00:03:26.910> had<00:03:27.060> an<00:03:27.240> extra<00:03:27.620> left<00:03:28.620> over<00:03:28.740> point<00:03:29.130> for

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
he had an extra left over point for

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.920 
he had an extra left over point for
durability<00:03:29.850> so<00:03:30.240> that's<00:03:30.390> where<00:03:30.510> we<00:03:30.570> put<00:03:30.690> that

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
durability so that's where we put that

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.750 
durability so that's where we put that
you<00:03:31.110> can<00:03:31.290> I<00:03:31.500> don't<00:03:32.310> know<00:03:32.370> if<00:03:32.490> it'll<00:03:32.580> fit

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
you can I don't know if it'll fit

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.460 
you can I don't know if it'll fit
anywhere<00:03:33.060> else<00:03:33.210> it<00:03:33.750> might<00:03:33.930> only<00:03:34.110> fit<00:03:34.350> on

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
anywhere else it might only fit on

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.370 
anywhere else it might only fit on
durability<00:03:35.010> but<00:03:35.370> anyways<00:03:36.360> there<00:03:37.020> you<00:03:37.170> have<00:03:37.350> it

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
durability but anyways there you have it

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.190 
durability but anyways there you have it
that<00:03:37.920> is<00:03:38.160> a<00:03:38.450> mr.<00:03:39.450> BFI's<00:03:39.840> winger<00:03:40.800> build
