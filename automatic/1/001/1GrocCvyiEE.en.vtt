00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:08.660
 [music] 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:11.900
 Hello, today I want to show how 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:14.600
 one very simple countryman is done 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.519
 what is it called I don't know more often 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.189
 let's think about the video where with them 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:23.630
 Here is a timchuk I have on my 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:27.349
 boys yes here it is 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:30.470
 need we need paracord yes 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:33.320
 I finally can not have such a meter eighty 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.510
 almost meter that's up to the principle there is nothing more 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.940
 and on where to wear a lanyard I am now 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.510
 I do not know where there are no places where you can 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.109
 it was not to attach well imagine 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.309
 what we 

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:50.269
 and let's take the scissors we will introduce 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:54.550
 what we cling to what we pass there 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:57.829
 through something turns out such a thing 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.739
 now watch one do a little 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:03.620
 shorter yes that's such 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.330
 length we will have a deal with a very 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.320
 large margin yes just to show 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.030
 how it's done 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.660
 how much do you need it already 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.440
 Individually so now I am this superfluous 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.210
 remove it is not interfered here about the case 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:21.710
 now see which long end 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:24.830
 it remains we make here a loop in 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:29.080
 let us go back 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.080
 times the loop and 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.080
 from this side without reaching the end we 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:38.120
 loop again and come back 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:41.150
 back here so it turns out here mount 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:44.530
 why we need to why we do 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.430
 these machoke then we make a loop 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.060
 come back do a loop 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.280
 Well, it means that about our length will be 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.950
 choke threads can do it away 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.240
 we will write less 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.720
 In general, it turned out 2 loops 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.970
 the same end of the paracord we start everything 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:08.860
 this is around all this 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:08.860
 braid without weaving our answer 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:16.739
 here are the words forgot potho typhoon h not 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:18.840
 we gain begin to wind down here 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.930
 circles 1 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.480
 not much at all not delaying 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:31.219
 stretching yes that's just doing it 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:34.620
 such are the winding yes so here I have three 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:36.540
 Only four or five winters can be quite 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.250
 make longer can be made shorter 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.930
 again individually how choo wants 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.419
 so we made a few turns and 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:53.219
 Now we are releasing this end here. 

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:57.239
 loop now look like this 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:03:01.230
 one loop at one end we adjust 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.530
 the length of the loop here that's this d that 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.329
 you will be 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:09.299
 and second rigu 2 we have this one 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:11.629
 rope through right through this whole 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.629
 our range 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:20.069
 Well, now for her pull and try 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:22.470
 so from api for come out here so here 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.780
 you can see the loop came out here this petrograd 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:31.730
 was she drifted through these 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:37.459
 yes and we pass 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:43.370
 now we have this loop 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:45.310
 also come back there pull here oh please 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:50.390
 forgiveness for Putin's friend 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:53.390
 so here for this shadow here is this loop 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:56.319
 which was that is this missed that 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:04:00.530
 here we have a loop so that we loop 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:04.489
 must allocate at fixing there 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:09.609
 fix well and now like this 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:14.209
 Makar we must adjust that is 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:17.810
 this is delayed this is pulled analysis 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:21.650
 rgb scart can't pick up words but 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.840
 Russian yes now I 'll show you recover 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:28.010
 have scrolled a little 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:30.440
 pulled tightened tightened now 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:33.139
 should it just often all the ropes 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:41.300
 except this one that regulates the course we 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:43.000
 pull up but in fact it's not 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:49.760
 just countryman 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:53.479
 this is a node for suicide water is not soap 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:56.120
 enough that is it is actually a node 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:05:03.070
 debt quotation on became strongly delayed on 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:03.070
 this share of which the person dies 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:13.680
 Well, wait and the power is now all pulled 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:16.020
 failed us is such a thing when 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:21.419
 all the land is ready you can cut off here 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:25.949
 Yes, and there is something somehow already or solder 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:28.379
 or throw to it and bowed here 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:30.960
 when the word does not know is even again 

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:33.870
 Today, the words are missing a little book of the new 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:38.400
 what am i so i want therefore semi 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:40.020
 add see what I did here for sure 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.610
 the same option just sitting can be seen 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.469
 the rest of the small long author 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.909
 By the way it is very convenient that it is very 

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:47.930
 very small at home grab and get 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:50.879
 a knife from my pocket I added such a shard a 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:55.860
 that is, I will do this lanyard then 

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:57.360
 through 2 shard and pro star knot or 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.610
 you can again do exactly the same 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.729
 countryman that is, if the length flaunted 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:06.090
 situations we can pass right now 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:10.250
 some shard let's even pro 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:13.669
 day he is exactly the same as he was 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.669
 we pass shard 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:24.050
 and can either tie a knot before or again 

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:25.960
 do exactly this turn out countryman 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.940
 shard and again and beacon 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.620
 here become what are and all the options 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:33.979
 if there are no such 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:39.530
 shards you can use 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:40.940
 ordinary nuts one or two to hook yes they 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.250
 there will be a dream hanging there will beat 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.720
 it will look cool 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:47.240
 word using nuts mole use 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.669
 a crock are any such grandmothers 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.400
 even before them you see some hieroglyphs 

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:54.020
 written by 

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:58.000
 you can also use all this 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:07:00.229
 use a washer yes not thick sfd 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.789
 a few pieces too will be crammed 

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:07.310
 cool as an option still sold in 

00:07:04.789 --> 00:07:10.130
 stationery dice playing after playing 

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:11.930
 let small you too people video 

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:15.979
 drilled through this same also 

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:17.509
 use but basically all about what today 

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:19.389
 wanted to tell before wanted to say about 

00:07:17.509 --> 00:07:22.880
 these are the key accessory 

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:25.880
 milked this very simple pen so very 

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.509
 comfortable believe me when you have a knife on 

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.719
 pocket 

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:33.259
 i.e. he is set on clips like this 

00:07:29.719 --> 00:07:36.979
 sticking like that so hatch cool yes 

00:07:33.259 --> 00:07:39.099
 and just grab and get the idea works 

00:07:36.979 --> 00:07:43.000
 well, all bye 

00:07:39.099 --> 00:07:43.000
 Like us good luck
