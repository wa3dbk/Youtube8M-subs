 It shows me fps 46 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.319
 and this is less than before 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.079
 Unfortunately runnier used to be very strong 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:57.750
 I fell fps and I had to put the game 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.359
 on the minimum salary, well, as the heir to them 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.479
 although I have a laptop then I'm fine, sort of 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:08.549
 would be so good look by the way here they are 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:11.509

 guys look at the question 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.670

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.860
 go already normal spearman inappropriately 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:54.550
 holds well and despite the fact that 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:56.350
 we have swordsmen but you didnâ€™t know how 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.150
 cope with our swordsmen 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:02.020
 at least their defense is good and 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.660
 much property well anyway the enemy 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.040
 the palm will lose the edge 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:09.190

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.840
 such a general gully kill 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:19.260
 for a song of minutes is quite here for some reason 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:21.150
 perhaps due to the fact that a lot of blood is 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:25.740
 case may also affect the taste or for 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:27.780
 in what way it should be circling 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.500
 stay like a screenshot on the ground well and 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.500

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:45.199

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:50.919

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:02.810

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:05.419
 Well, guys, this is such a battle 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.889

 a portion of the meat of the guys so the kebab servings 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.670
 Come here and if outside the normal zone 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.900
 raise it is possible for 

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:32.440
 and put the fighters while we are on the threshold 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.440
 flying 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.660

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:54.999
 blood stopper seems to be looking here 

00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:57.990

00:06:54.999 --> 00:07:01.120
 look ok so keeps 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:04.900
 that is, let's look at the FPS 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:06.969
 here I had to do this 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.069
 I need to make ultra high 

00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:11.080

00:07:09.069 --> 00:07:14.020
 so perfectly fine fine i mean 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:16.810
 the game becomes more colorful yes and you 

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:19.900
 immersed in here unusual antique and 

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:24.449
 cruel world where there is a rod head it 

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:27.699
 was so everyday task of occupation 

00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:28.180
 Well, guys with you mass wait for new 

00:07:27.699 --> 00:07:30.069
 series 

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:32.469
 we will of course continue the company 

00:07:30.069 --> 00:07:34.389
 continue any network battles and tests 

00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:36.789
 detachments but we will look different 

00:07:34.389 --> 00:07:39.759
 modifications too suggest if you 

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:41.589
 you know what modification that 

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:43.990
 standing up to my attention then no problem 

00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:46.210

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:48.909
 business and maybe I will do too 

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:52.629
 small reviews on different mod though 

00:07:48.909 --> 00:07:54.870
 evil is a fashion 

00:07:52.629 --> 00:07:54.870
