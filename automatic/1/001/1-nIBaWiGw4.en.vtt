00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.660 

but<00:00:15.980> I'm<00:00:16.129> using<00:00:16.369> some<00:00:16.789> stuff<00:00:18.070> but<00:00:19.070> I<00:00:19.220> will<00:00:19.430> show

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
but I'm using some stuff but I will show

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.609 
but I'm using some stuff but I will show
that<00:00:19.880> later<00:00:20.180> on<00:00:20.330> in<00:00:20.779> the<00:00:20.960> interview<00:00:21.289> because

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
that later on in the interview because

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:22.990 
that later on in the interview because
there<00:00:21.920> are<00:00:22.039> some<00:00:22.250> little<00:00:22.400> things<00:00:22.550> here<00:00:22.970> and

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
there are some little things here and

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.060 
there are some little things here and
there<00:00:23.150> that<00:00:23.270> I'm<00:00:23.509> using<00:00:23.660> such<00:00:24.169> as<00:00:24.349> a<00:00:24.380> slab<00:00:24.800> of

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
there that I'm using such as a slab of

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.029 
there that I'm using such as a slab of
tapes<00:00:25.400> and<00:00:25.930> sweeping<00:00:26.930> techniques<00:00:27.410> so<00:00:27.829> maybe

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039 
tapes and sweeping techniques so maybe

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.069 
tapes and sweeping techniques so maybe
what<00:00:28.250> I<00:00:28.279> can<00:00:28.550> do<00:00:28.669> is<00:00:28.849> just<00:00:29.240> chapter<00:00:29.840> by<00:00:30.050> chapter

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:30.079 
what I can do is just chapter by chapter

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:32.979 
what I can do is just chapter by chapter
go<00:00:30.980> from<00:00:31.340> one<00:00:31.579> to<00:00:31.789> the<00:00:31.939> other<00:00:32.059> technique<00:00:32.780> so

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
go from one to the other technique so

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:34.479 
go from one to the other technique so
the<00:00:33.379> first<00:00:33.590> thing<00:00:33.890> I'm<00:00:34.040> going<00:00:34.070> to<00:00:34.250> show<00:00:34.430> you

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
the first thing I'm going to show you

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.420 
the first thing I'm going to show you
now<00:00:34.790> is<00:00:35.059> how<00:00:35.120> to<00:00:35.420> perform<00:00:35.750> slap<00:00:36.350> on<00:00:36.620> the<00:00:36.680> guitar

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
now is how to perform slap on the guitar

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.210 
now is how to perform slap on the guitar
in<00:00:37.970> fact<00:00:38.150> the<00:00:38.239> Technic<00:00:38.570> is<00:00:38.660> very<00:00:38.870> close<00:00:39.199> to<00:00:39.230> the

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
in fact the Technic is very close to the

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.189 
in fact the Technic is very close to the
bass<00:00:40.400> technique<00:00:40.879> I'm<00:00:41.089> mainly<00:00:41.600> using<00:00:42.050> the

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:42.199 
bass technique I'm mainly using the

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:45.270 
bass technique I'm mainly using the
thumb<00:00:42.410> for<00:00:43.100> picking<00:00:43.879> the<00:00:44.030> first<00:00:44.629> two<00:00:44.870> strings

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
thumb for picking the first two strings

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.140 
thumb for picking the first two strings
so<00:00:46.280> the<00:00:46.879> first<00:00:47.089> thing<00:00:47.239> is<00:00:47.420> just<00:00:47.449> to<00:00:47.839> use

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.150 
so the first thing is just to use

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.060 
so the first thing is just to use
microphone<00:00:50.150> combination<00:00:50.780> I<00:00:51.019> use<00:00:51.440> position

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
microphone combination I use position

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.039 
microphone combination I use position
now<00:00:52.159> before<00:00:52.580> that<00:00:52.970> means<00:00:53.210> this<00:00:53.510> one<00:00:53.750> and<00:00:53.930> that

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:54.049 
now before that means this one and that

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:58.570 
now before that means this one and that
one<00:00:54.260> and<00:00:55.059> the<00:00:56.059> thing<00:00:56.239> is<00:00:56.479> I'm<00:00:56.930> just<00:00:57.580> hitting

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:58.580 
one and the thing is I'm just hitting

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.520 
one and the thing is I'm just hitting
the<00:00:58.879> string<00:00:59.150> with<00:00:59.449> this<00:00:59.750> part<00:01:00.019> of<00:01:00.110> my<00:01:00.229> thumb

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
the string with this part of my thumb

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.729 
the string with this part of my thumb
did<00:01:01.250> the<00:01:01.640> joints<00:01:02.030> between<00:01:02.180> the<00:01:02.420> two<00:01:02.659> the<00:01:03.559> two

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
did the joints between the two the two

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.570 
did the joints between the two the two
knuckles<00:01:04.100> and<00:01:04.630> I'm<00:01:05.630> just<00:01:05.930> eating<00:01:06.369> like<00:01:07.369> this

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
knuckles and I'm just eating like this

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.820 
knuckles and I'm just eating like this
so<00:01:08.510> the<00:01:08.600> thing<00:01:08.750> is<00:01:08.900> trying<00:01:09.170> to<00:01:09.350> find<00:01:09.590> a<00:01:09.680> good

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
so the thing is trying to find a good

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.280 
so the thing is trying to find a good
position<00:01:10.159> not<00:01:10.520> to<00:01:10.670> have<00:01:10.820> the<00:01:10.970> harmony<00:01:11.450> because

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
position not to have the harmony because

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.140 
position not to have the harmony because
if<00:01:12.590> you<00:01:12.680> have<00:01:12.860> they<00:01:12.950> already<00:01:13.070> end<00:01:13.520> and<00:01:14.030> the

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
if you have they already end and the

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.109 
if you have they already end and the
note<00:01:14.330> is<00:01:14.540> not<00:01:14.689> very<00:01:14.960> well<00:01:15.200> but<00:01:15.680> heard<00:01:16.400> so<00:01:17.000> the

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
note is not very well but heard so the

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.220 
note is not very well but heard so the
first<00:01:17.299> move<00:01:17.630> is<00:01:17.810> just<00:01:19.780> you<00:01:20.780> don't<00:01:20.900> have<00:01:21.110> to

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.230 
first move is just you don't have to

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.810 
first move is just you don't have to
stay<00:01:21.440> stuck<00:01:21.710> to<00:01:21.860> the<00:01:21.980> string<00:01:22.220> you<00:01:22.370> really<00:01:22.610> get

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
stay stuck to the string you really get

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.990 
stay stuck to the string you really get
to<00:01:22.940> have<00:01:23.090> a<00:01:23.120> rebound<00:01:24.040> and<00:01:25.040> it's<00:01:25.190> very<00:01:25.400> soft<00:01:25.700> you

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
to have a rebound and it's very soft you

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.660 
to have a rebound and it's very soft you
don't<00:01:26.330> have<00:01:26.480> to<00:01:26.660> eat<00:01:26.840> pretty<00:01:27.110> hard<00:01:27.640> then<00:01:28.640> the

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
don't have to eat pretty hard then the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.460 
don't have to eat pretty hard then the
second<00:01:29.060> sound<00:01:29.210> comes<00:01:29.720> with<00:01:29.930> the<00:01:30.020> left<00:01:30.230> hand

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
second sound comes with the left hand

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.920 
second sound comes with the left hand
when<00:01:30.860> you<00:01:30.950> have<00:01:31.070> a<00:01:31.100> protrusion<00:01:31.400> of<00:01:31.790> you<00:01:32.000> so<00:01:32.840> you

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
when you have a protrusion of you so you

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:41.320 
when you have a protrusion of you so you
can<00:01:33.140> just<00:01:33.350> work<00:01:33.560> out<00:01:33.860> the<00:01:34.190> the<00:01:35.120> answers<00:01:40.330> then

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
can just work out the the answers then

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.780 
can just work out the the answers then
the<00:01:41.510> next<00:01:41.840> step<00:01:42.110> is<00:01:42.350> to<00:01:42.560> have<00:01:42.710> a<00:01:42.980> ghost<00:01:43.430> notes

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
the next step is to have a ghost notes

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.060 
the next step is to have a ghost notes
so<00:01:44.510> here<00:01:44.810> are<00:01:44.930> you<00:01:45.140> mute<00:01:45.350> the<00:01:45.470> strings<00:01:45.770> and

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
so here are you mute the strings and

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.060 
so here are you mute the strings and
here<00:01:46.340> your<00:01:46.550> heat<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:46.850> string<00:01:47.680> so<00:01:48.680> here<00:01:48.920> are

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
here your heat the string so here are

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.399 
here your heat the string so here are
now<00:01:49.250> three<00:01:49.610> sounds<00:01:50.000> in<00:01:50.090> a<00:01:50.150> row<00:01:53.110> so<00:01:54.110> with<00:01:54.260> those

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
now three sounds in a row so with those

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.230 
now three sounds in a row so with those
three<00:01:54.590> sounds<00:01:55.070> you<00:01:55.250> can<00:01:55.340> already<00:01:55.700> do<00:01:55.970> some

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
three sounds you can already do some

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:03.620 
three sounds you can already do some
really<00:01:57.229> nice<00:01:57.950> little<00:01:58.310> rhythm<00:01:58.640> patterns

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:15.330 

[Music]

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.580 

of<00:02:16.340> course<00:02:16.610> using<00:02:17.240> those<00:02:17.600> techniques<00:02:18.080> very

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
of course using those techniques very

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.490 
of course using those techniques very
basics<00:02:19.070> you<00:02:19.940> can<00:02:20.180> or<00:02:20.420> you<00:02:20.780> can<00:02:20.900> also<00:02:21.110> add<00:02:21.470> some

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
basics you can or you can also add some

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.310 
basics you can or you can also add some
stuff<00:02:22.040> on<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.640> a<00:02:22.670> string<00:02:22.850> such<00:02:23.390> as<00:02:23.570> pull<00:02:24.050> offs

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
stuff on the a string such as pull offs
