take full Sun right now but because of

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:56.940 
take full Sun right now but because of
where<00:01:55.660> it's<00:01:55.780> positioned<00:01:55.900> it<00:01:56.290> happens<00:01:56.650> to<00:01:56.830> get

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
where it's positioned it happens to get

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
why is it so black it's not black

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.660 
why is it so black it's not black
because<00:02:35.110> you<00:02:35.140> added<00:02:35.530> black<00:02:35.680> soil<00:02:35.980> it's<00:02:36.250> it's

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
because you added black soil it's it's

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.430 
because you added black soil it's it's
cooked<00:02:37.030> itself<00:02:37.480> into<00:02:37.720> that<00:02:37.840> color<00:02:38.019> correct

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
cooked itself into that color correct

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.120 
cooked itself into that color correct
that<00:02:39.400> is<00:02:39.519> nothing<00:02:39.670> but<00:02:39.820> raw<00:02:40.440> material<00:02:41.440> that

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
that is nothing but raw material that

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.660 
that is nothing but raw material that
has<00:02:42.250> decomp<00:02:42.670> in<00:02:42.820> is<00:02:43.000> composted<00:02:43.900> all<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.350> time

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
has decomp in is composted all the time

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:51.000

with tons of worms in there so this is

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.770 
with tons of worms in there so this is
what<00:02:51.160> your<00:02:51.280> soil<00:02:51.580> should<00:02:51.730> look<00:02:51.850> like<00:02:51.880> and<00:02:52.299> I've
