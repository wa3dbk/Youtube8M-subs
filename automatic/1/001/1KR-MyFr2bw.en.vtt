 rifle and with chorizo ​​and chicken imagine 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.360
 nothing else if that were not enough we're going to 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.789
 grilling the ingredients on the screen 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.400
 write down the ones you are very good at 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.400
 love there against activity in little house 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.439
 go scoring what the rifle looks at and it's this 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.470
 pasta that we have here 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.820
 previously cooked if you can not find it 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.100
 worry any short part is 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.590
 proper can be the pen pasta can 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.290
 be also the cubes that are a little 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.050
 larger but this is simple 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.559
 find her how she is going to cook in water 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.180
 plentiful boiling with salt 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:51.090
 approximately eight minutes will be left 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.520
 al dente and delicious then the 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.829
 cool we went through cold water and a 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.289
 little bit of oil that will keep it 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.750
 in very good condition until you already 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.329
 have the opportunity to use it 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.140
 then let's start look 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.650
 we have the chorizo 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:13.030
 it has been seen that it is delicious sra 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:15.430
 this story is very Spanish style very 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.860
 rich is delicious but if not 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.590
 find it can be ranchero chorizo 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.900
 I also put a little oil 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.540
 olive remember that is the driver of 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.850
 heat so it's going to help us that the 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:32.200
 sausage is made faster and such 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:35.530
 it smells already delicious and that's a piece of 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.630
 true chorizo and they asked me 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.390
 what is it and where do they find it good? 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.100
 they have salchichonería area there they go to 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.470
 find the chorizo so I already 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.229
 have hanged or have it there in 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.330
 different times because they have 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.759
 different brands but the one that you 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.800
 want is rich is well well tasty 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.080
 then we will reach a point that 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.750
 wants the golden sausage but not 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.649
 burn us down here we go 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.479
 already giving the fat and the flavor and this 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.149
 will be a very important part of 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.470
 seasoning hear and talking about 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.960
 condiments 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.600
 of the chile look what I have a pepper 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.530
 I think the most beautiful thing seems to me 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.790
 of the universe 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:21.880
 what beautiful healthy red to me 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.580
 love how peppers come as 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:28.210
 all the chilies we can see when they are 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.940
 firm how cute they are and know they have 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.280
 a scale where we can measure how 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.980
 spicy are the red pepper is the 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.880
 number one is the shortest the least 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.940
 spicy are 2,500 degrees on that scale 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:46.060
 discovered escobio is an american was not 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.160
 an American that in 1900 and that's 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.890
 graphic indeed won prizes very 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.140
 important for his discovery or his 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.980
 study about chilies imagine 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:01.000
 nothing more the hottest which is 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.980
 Exactly up to 450,000 habanero 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.349
 degrees 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.870
 imagine nothing else so it's very 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:09.940
 interesting all grades of spicy 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.150
 I have been asked a lot about how much they sting 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.730
 because everything has a why a scale 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.849
 a few degrees and the pepper is the most 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.489
 short of spicy taste until you get 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:24.220
 the delicious habanero is more I say 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:28.450
 come my mouth watering 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:32.040

 little golden so rich on a successful bread 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.349
 wonderful then we got it out of the 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.510
 pan to give us space to 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:43.209
 keep cooking and let us leave your 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.170
 poquita grasita is rich is going to give 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.960
 good taste 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.250
 then we add the chicken here 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.070
 cooked hole 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:57.250
 in cubes to give more protein to 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:04:00.950
 our saucer we are going to add onion 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:03.620
 spinach lady always remember to add 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.560
 something green a vegetable so that its 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.110

 unique dishes because no battle won 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.230
 marcelo silva plastic and if you want 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:21.080
 accompany it with a tomato salad 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:23.300

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.520

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.180
 we put the pepper that 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:33.280
 previously we roasted and we removed the skin 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:37.000

 lady, if you can, I promise you 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:05.130
 They will not do it very often because other 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:07.230
 which are many calories and once the 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:10.050
 week I think it does not happen absolutely 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:12.600
 nothing me and the children nor what to eat 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.389
 calories have to be fed 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:18.389

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:25.040
 It stings the chorizo ​​either then it goes to 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:28.080
 be a very friendly dish for children 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.740
 there we were mixing very well we left 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:36.229

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:39.349
