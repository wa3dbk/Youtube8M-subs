00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.640 

let's<00:00:03.000> see<00:00:03.240> if<00:00:03.330> I<00:00:03.449> can<00:00:03.629> make<00:00:03.659> it<00:00:03.870> through<00:00:04.200> level

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
let's see if I can make it through level

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.990 
let's see if I can make it through level
2<00:00:04.890> here<00:00:05.279> while<00:00:05.520> I'm<00:00:05.960> recording<00:00:06.960> this<00:00:07.790> is<00:00:08.790> my

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
2 here while I'm recording this is my

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:19.090 
2 here while I'm recording this is my
little<00:00:09.240> pics<00:00:09.960> 64<00:00:10.920> game<00:00:12.799> level<00:00:13.799> two

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.450 

still<00:00:19.790> not<00:00:19.940> too<00:00:20.150> fast<00:00:20.420> so<00:00:21.040> you<00:00:22.040> shouldn't<00:00:22.340> be

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
still not too fast so you shouldn't be

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.920 
still not too fast so you shouldn't be
too<00:00:22.700> bad<00:00:22.730> here

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.690 

cuz<00:00:28.470> I'm<00:00:28.590> gonna<00:00:28.740> get<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.010> hard<00:00:29.280> one<00:00:29.490> right

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:29.700 
cuz I'm gonna get the hard one right

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:37.490 
cuz I'm gonna get the hard one right
away<00:00:32.030> app<00:00:33.770> died<00:00:34.770> right<00:00:35.070> away<00:00:36.170> let's<00:00:37.170> try<00:00:37.440> this

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
away app died right away let's try this

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.110 
away app died right away let's try this
again

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.830 

let's<00:00:42.719> pick<00:00:43.110> my<00:00:43.739> game<00:00:44.100> there<00:00:44.399> we<00:00:44.550> go<00:00:47.629> level<00:00:48.629> one

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
let's pick my game there we go level one

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:56.540 
let's pick my game there we go level one
of<00:00:49.530> one's<00:00:49.860> nice<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.460> slow

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.310 

it<00:00:57.030> seems<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.510> slow<00:00:57.780> unless<00:00:58.079> you're<00:00:58.230> actually

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
it seems to slow unless you're actually

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:06.750 
it seems to slow unless you're actually
playing<00:00:58.739> it

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.310 

I<00:01:06.850> should<00:01:07.540> say<00:01:07.660> unless<00:01:07.780> you're<00:01:07.990> playing<00:01:08.170> it

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
I should say unless you're playing it

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:20.970 
I should say unless you're playing it
with<00:01:08.440> a<00:01:08.470> camera<00:01:08.770> in<00:01:08.950> your<00:01:09.010> hand

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:20.980 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:29.850 

that's<00:01:22.210> one<00:01:23.210> over

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:39.380 

so<00:01:30.550> far<00:01:30.760> so<00:01:30.970> good

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.890 

look<00:01:39.990> there<00:01:40.650> we<00:01:40.740> go<00:01:41.030> it's<00:01:42.030> easy<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.330> move<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.690> so

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
look there we go it's easy to move to so

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.800 
look there we go it's easy to move to so
far<00:01:44.030> you<00:01:45.030> can<00:01:45.380> tweak<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.560> code<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:47.220> make<00:01:47.810> it

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
far you can tweak the code to make it

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.410 
far you can tweak the code to make it
not<00:01:49.369> accelerate<00:01:50.369> so<00:01:50.550> much<00:01:50.760> but<00:01:50.970> i<00:01:51.000> found<00:01:51.240> this

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
not accelerate so much but i found this

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:59.150 
not accelerate so much but i found this
setting<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:52.050> be<00:01:52.260> the<00:01:53.070> best<00:01:53.310> balance<00:01:58.160> something

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
setting to be the best balance something

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.830 
setting to be the best balance something
like<00:01:59.280> this<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.490> needs<00:01:59.820> precise<00:02:00.270> movements

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
like this that needs precise movements

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.109 
like this that needs precise movements
is<00:02:00.990> not<00:02:01.170> really<00:02:01.470> a<00:02:01.500> great<00:02:01.830> analog<00:02:02.490> joystick

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
is not really a great analog joystick

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:09.350 
is not really a great analog joystick
game<00:02:03.680> but<00:02:04.680> hey<00:02:04.950> why<00:02:05.280> not<00:02:07.819> now<00:02:08.819> this<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.030> one<00:02:09.330> of

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
game but hey why not now this is one of

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.790 
game but hey why not now this is one of
those<00:02:09.509> trick<00:02:09.840> sections

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.740 

I<00:02:15.860> guess<00:02:16.610> I<00:02:16.730> could<00:02:16.880> have<00:02:16.970> gone<00:02:17.090> up<00:02:17.240> either<00:02:17.420> side

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
I guess I could have gone up either side

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.380 
I guess I could have gone up either side
would<00:02:18.550> have<00:02:19.550> been<00:02:19.640> easier<00:02:19.970> going<00:02:20.120> up<00:02:20.300> the

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
would have been easier going up the

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:27.360 
would have been easier going up the
other<00:02:20.540> side

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:36.960 

let's<00:02:27.940> give<00:02:28.239> up

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.870 

over

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.000 

but<00:02:40.510> for<00:02:40.810> a<00:02:40.840> level<00:02:41.170> one<00:02:41.320> it's<00:02:41.530> kind<00:02:41.740> of<00:02:41.770> tight

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
but for a level one it's kind of tight

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.390 
but for a level one it's kind of tight
in<00:02:42.160> here

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:52.309 

well<00:02:46.030> this<00:02:46.180> is<00:02:46.329> the<00:02:46.360> key<00:02:46.659> one

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:03:02.010 

it<00:02:52.859> looks<00:02:53.159> like<00:02:53.219> maybe<00:02:53.549> I'm<00:02:53.790> finishing<00:02:54.209> up<00:02:54.390> yay

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.620 

they're<00:03:02.620> made<00:03:03.400> it<00:03:03.550> out

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.600 

click<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.410> joystick<00:03:08.860> to<00:03:08.980> go<00:03:09.130> to<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:09.340> next

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
click the joystick to go to the next

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.500 
click the joystick to go to the next
level

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.179 

let's<00:03:16.080> see<00:03:16.200> it<00:03:16.260> gets<00:03:16.409> a<00:03:16.470> little<00:03:16.560> bit<00:03:16.739> faster

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:17.189 
let's see it gets a little bit faster

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:30.360 
let's see it gets a little bit faster
and<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.400> level<00:03:17.879> gets<00:03:18.060> longer

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.520 

I<00:03:30.430> randomly<00:03:31.530> assemble<00:03:32.530> the<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:34.840> level<00:03:35.200> from<00:03:35.440> a

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
I randomly assemble the the level from a

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.479 
I randomly assemble the the level from a
number<00:03:35.830> of<00:03:35.860> screens<00:03:36.489> that<00:03:36.760> I've<00:03:36.879> created

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
number of screens that I've created

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:43.229 
number of screens that I've created
actually<00:03:39.489> using<00:03:39.879> a<00:03:40.349> an<00:03:41.349> 8-bit<00:03:42.159> font<00:03:42.459> or<00:03:42.730> an

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
actually using a an 8-bit font or an

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.580 
actually using a an 8-bit font or an
eight<00:03:43.390> by<00:03:43.569> eight<00:03:43.599> font<00:03:44.140> editor

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:04:01.640 

so<00:03:49.220> kind<00:03:49.400> of<00:03:49.489> fun

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:14.030 

one<00:04:02.220> of<00:04:02.310> the<00:04:02.400> breathing<00:04:02.819> room<00:04:02.849> screens<00:04:03.450> here

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.180 

and<00:04:14.459> you<00:04:15.060> get<00:04:15.180> the<00:04:15.299> point<00:04:15.510> now<00:04:15.750> just<00:04:16.070> let<00:04:17.070> it

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
and you get the point now just let it

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.140 
and you get the point now just let it
crash<00:04:17.489> on<00:04:17.699> this<00:04:17.880> one

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.310 

game<00:04:22.810> over

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.220 

well<00:04:26.920> thanks<00:04:27.190> to<00:04:27.250> fabian<00:04:28.060> and<00:04:28.150> britt<00:04:28.750> ron<00:04:28.930> for

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
well thanks to fabian and britt ron for

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.500 
well thanks to fabian and britt ron for
creating<00:04:29.860> such<00:04:29.890> a<00:04:30.100> great<00:04:30.370> little<00:04:30.580> netduino

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
creating such a great little netduino

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.110 
creating such a great little netduino
based<00:04:31.810> game<00:04:32.440> console<00:04:32.980> so<00:04:33.220> it's<00:04:33.700> really<00:04:33.910> fun<00:04:34.090> to

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
based game console so it's really fun to

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.990 
based game console so it's really fun to
create<00:04:34.330> this<00:04:34.510> first<00:04:34.780> game
