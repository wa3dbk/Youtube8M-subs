00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.670
 once the body is saved 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:27.470
 infantry on November 17, 1910 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.290
 arises the creation of some units 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:34.430
 special at that time called 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:37.370
 drive groups well they went 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.970
 grouping men who received 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:44.120
 a special instruction to be able 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:46.910
 solve any internal crisis that 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.150
 occurred in the city setting 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.670
 of buenos aires 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:56.100
 then this was the way to how 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:59.220
 reduce people who have the 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.340
 altered mental faculties and it's like that 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.199
 that with the same before the same staff 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.480
 that formed the groups raids 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.300
 groups of mind reactions are created 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:13.080
 with the passing of time these two 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:16.980
 work hypotheses were unified to 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:21.170
 1975 where 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:23.580
 they create the special combat group and that 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.400
 configured the two hypotheses to be able 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:33.030
 work anywhere in the city 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:36.150
 buenos aires is created in 1988 the 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.800
 groups of police operations and already 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.580
 appears then 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.740
 he calls them g1 special group 1 already 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.080
 then this continues its course follows 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.320
 advancing new ones continue to develop 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:54.090
 techniques are acquired new weapons and 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:57.120
 for the year 1000 2004 on August 4 of 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.620
 2004 , the institutional 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:03.350
 section special groups that one 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.150
 for last year for the 17th 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.880
 November 2014 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.210
 what was the section happens to conform 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.110
 division we rise in rank 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:20.260
 we already have this regulated by order 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.260
 of the day our working hypothesis 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.750
 the working hypotheses are 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.060
 specifically we work in 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.370
 fast resolution drive 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:39.010
 We work as a response group in 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.840
 mental health crisis what 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.060
 formerly were the reductions of 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.410
 today we call them crisis 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.260
 of mental health 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.450
 we work as a tactical support group 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:53.320
 for any situation where it is needed 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:57.010
 you need this a special group or a 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:03:01.410
 tactical group of rapid intervention by 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:06.280
 example in custody custody and 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:09.310
 custodies of agents transfers 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.140
 where material should be guarded 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.860
 example weapons that can for 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.450
 destruction we really do it when 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.250
 the armament division demolition us 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.250
 summons to appear 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:38.200
 a few days ago the position of the 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:40.300
 comisarÃ­a 19 a person who was 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.170
 altered by the consumption of 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:46.360
 narcotic drugs more precisely cocaine 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:51.300
 I had overflowed 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.300
 and I was in a violent crisis 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:59.210
 in a first at first when the 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:01.720
 mobile 100 119 is called or displaced 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:05.090
 by the electric command then this 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.500
 due to the overflow they were in that 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.710
 moment and they did not have the staff 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.260
 specific to achieve control 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.900
 this person does not the general direction of 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:18.799
 operative condition moves us to the 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:21.170
 place to be able to operate directly 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:24.250
 about the person to control it from 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.250
 intern her then 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.950
 they were inside his home and the person 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.450
 I was completely upset 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.540
 once we take 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:39.190
 intervention through the head of the 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.730
 Section intelligence operations 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.730
 tactic 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.600
 all possible data is collected 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:50.170
 about the person a photograph is taken 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.650
 of the person whether this is a 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:55.300
 person with a psychiatric history 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:58.750
 if it is a violent person 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:02.290
 nature if you have your status 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:04.990
 violence was produced by some other 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:07.740
 circumstances for example in the case 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.740
 to be 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:16.670
 or be addicted to some substance 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:21.560
 prohibited and in this way is 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:25.180
 the tactic is organized here we are going to 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.180
 carry out to reduce it 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:37.300
 we also take contact with relatives 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.940
 direct so they can give us a 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.310
 overview of the person in 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.650
 this case was the wife who also 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:47.620
 I was in a crisis be nervous 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:50.530
 due to the fact that I was living there 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:54.790
 she tells us not to tell us that the husband 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:58.900
 was this cocaine addict and that already 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:06:01.630
 three days ago I was consuming and 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.250
 well there comes a time that this one 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.129
 I can not stand people and exploited a 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:08.849
 nervous breakdown 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:11.759
 for all displacement for all 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:13.949
 hypothesis that we have is coming soon 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:16.800
 an officer and twelve men is this the 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:21.270
 let's say minimum number to achieve 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:23.780
 any this tactical operation 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:26.400
 the statistic is quite broad this 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:28.110
 taking into account all hypotheses 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.300
 of work whether for workouts 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.720
 of rapid resolution the health crisis 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:36.030
 mental or tactical support groups 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:39.630
 we are as average we are have 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:42.200
 a daily intervention practically 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:42.200
 every day 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:47.639
 day by day 

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:49.349
 all operational decisions either 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:53.189
 of the superintendence of drugs 

00:06:49.349 --> 00:06:55.720
 dangerous or investigations or even the 

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:58.380
 address than that of police stations 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.930
 through the investigations that go 

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:02.610
 developing by this 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:05.430
 own own investigations 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:08.550
 they always conclude with an intervention 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:10.800
 fast because for example in the 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:14.340
 case of dangerous drugs they ask you for a 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:16.710
 tactical group so that for it to be done 

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:19.390
 a rapid breakthrough and do not miss the 

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:21.550
 test in the event that he 

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:24.450
 the criminals who are in the 

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:28.900
 interior of the place pave can 

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:31.900
 destroy the test thing that can throw 

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:35.550
 to the floor a long investigation either 

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:38.170
 of either one week a month or 

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:40.870
 intelligence operations that have 

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:42.910
 delayed intervention for a long time 

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:45.790
 tactic has to be this fast and 

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:48.610
 fast to be able to control ensure to 

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:50.260
 people to have them and ensure more 

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:52.860
 that nothing proves it for then in the 

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:55.909
 judicial process will reach a 

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:55.909
 to a conviction
