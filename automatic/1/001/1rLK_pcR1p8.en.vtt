that<00:02:45.360> but<00:02:46.360> yet<00:02:46.569> yeah<00:02:47.260> so<00:02:47.650> I<00:02:47.680> found<00:02:47.980> this<00:02:48.069> the

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
that but yet yeah so I found this the

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.970 
that but yet yeah so I found this the
easiest<00:02:48.519> way<00:02:48.849> to<00:02:48.910> do<00:02:49.120> it<00:02:49.239> so<00:02:49.840> you<00:02:49.989> would<00:02:50.230> grab

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
easiest way to do it so you would grab

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.000 
easiest way to do it so you would grab
it<00:02:51.180> grip<00:02:52.180> it<00:02:52.209> real<00:02:52.510> hard<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:53.079> then<00:02:53.260> pull<00:02:53.829> it

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
it grip it real hard and then pull it

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:01.309 
it grip it real hard and then pull it
apart<00:02:55.049> you<00:02:56.049> see<00:02:56.260> that<00:02:56.470> is<00:02:56.590> very<00:02:56.799> showing<00:02:59.760> so

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
apart you see that is very showing so

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.990 
apart you see that is very showing so
why<00:03:02.319> do<00:03:02.380> I<00:03:02.530> do<00:03:02.620> this<00:03:02.769> all<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.040> time<00:03:03.130> so<00:03:03.730> you<00:03:03.819> do

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
why do I do this all the time so you do

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:12.360 
why do I do this all the time so you do
that<00:03:05.730> do<00:03:06.730> that<00:03:10.139> if<00:03:11.139> you're<00:03:11.530> finding<00:03:11.829> it<00:03:12.040> hard

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
that do that if you're finding it hard

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.030 
that do that if you're finding it hard
try<00:03:13.000> to<00:03:13.060> twist<00:03:13.750> it<00:03:13.900> like<00:03:13.959> this<00:03:14.260> that<00:03:14.829> way<00:03:14.980> it

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
try to twist it like this that way it

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.599 
try to twist it like this that way it
will<00:03:15.100> curve<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:15.700> skin<00:03:16.000> and<00:03:17.040> make<00:03:18.040> it<00:03:18.190> easier

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
will curve the skin and make it easier

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:26.550 
will curve the skin and make it easier
so<00:03:19.739> perfect<00:03:20.739> like<00:03:20.829> this<00:03:21.930> or<00:03:22.930> whatever<00:03:25.560> I've

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
so perfect like this or whatever I've

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.170 
so perfect like this or whatever I've
seen<00:03:26.829> people<00:03:26.889> try<00:03:27.160> to<00:03:27.310> break<00:03:27.579> it<00:03:27.700> like<00:03:27.849> this

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
seen people try to break it like this

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.470 
seen people try to break it like this
and<00:03:28.239> they<00:03:29.230> end<00:03:29.410> up<00:03:29.620> with<00:03:29.829> like<00:03:29.859> half<00:03:30.730> the<00:03:31.000> Apple
