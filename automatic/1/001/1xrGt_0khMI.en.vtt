00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
first these are just a three-in-one

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.629 
first these are just a three-in-one
pliers<00:00:12.450> kit<00:00:12.840> they<00:00:13.259> are<00:00:13.380> always<00:00:13.620> inside<00:00:14.309> row

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
pliers kit they are always inside row

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.060 
pliers kit they are always inside row
from<00:00:14.880> making<00:00:15.269> charms<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:16.109> that<00:00:16.590> glistens<00:00:16.949> in

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
from making charms and that glistens in

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.990 
from making charms and that glistens in
etc<00:00:17.720> next<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:18.869> have<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.380> few<00:00:19.740> blades<00:00:20.039> these<00:00:20.820> are

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
etc next I have a few blades these are

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.400 
etc next I have a few blades these are
the<00:00:21.150> three-in-one<00:00:21.480> kids<00:00:21.840> that<00:00:22.020> you<00:00:22.109> could<00:00:22.230> go

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
the three-in-one kids that you could go

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.710 
the three-in-one kids that you could go
grab<00:00:22.590> at<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.010> craft<00:00:23.519> store<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:24.150> think<00:00:24.630> they

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
grab at the craft store I think they

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.269 
grab at the craft store I think they
make<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.080> for<00:00:25.109> almost<00:00:25.380> every<00:00:25.769> claimed<00:00:25.980> brand

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
make it for almost every claimed brand

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.519 
make it for almost every claimed brand
but<00:00:26.910> these<00:00:27.180> are<00:00:27.330> definitely<00:00:27.599> not<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.380> most

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
but these are definitely not the most

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.160 
but these are definitely not the most
essential<00:00:28.830> items<00:00:29.449> next<00:00:30.449> I<00:00:30.599> see<00:00:30.840> are<00:00:30.960> two

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
essential items next I see are two

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.950 
essential items next I see are two
paintbrushes<00:00:32.210> these<00:00:33.210> are<00:00:33.390> just<00:00:33.420> two<00:00:33.750> random

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
paintbrushes these are just two random

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.630

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.420 
ones I grabbed at the dollar store and
they<00:00:35.790> lost<00:00:36.030> pretty<00:00:36.450> longer<00:00:37.079> than<00:00:37.230> expected<00:00:37.430> so

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
they lost pretty longer than expected so

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.630 
they lost pretty longer than expected so
um<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.480> just<00:00:39.540> got<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.140> really<00:00:40.320> small<00:00:40.649> one<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.129> a

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
um I just got a really small one and a

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.910 
um I just got a really small one and a
bit<00:00:41.969> bigger<00:00:42.329> brush<00:00:42.660> but<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:43.290> could<00:00:43.440> just<00:00:43.649> grab

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
bit bigger brush but you could just grab

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.220 
bit bigger brush but you could just grab
a<00:00:43.980> head<00:00:44.430> whatever<00:00:45.000> brush<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.420> need<00:00:45.570> depending

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
a head whatever brush you need depending

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.860 
a head whatever brush you need depending
on<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.500> size<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:47.039> your<00:00:47.070> magic<00:00:47.489> pieces<00:00:47.910> then<00:00:48.750> I

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
on the size of your magic pieces then I

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.229 
on the size of your magic pieces then I
also<00:00:49.079> came<00:00:49.379> more<00:00:49.710> blade<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:50.730> these<00:00:50.879> are<00:00:51.090> just

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
also came more blade so these are just

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.750 
also came more blade so these are just
two<00:00:51.510> exacto<00:00:52.020> blades<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.559> always<00:00:53.039> carry<00:00:53.460> two

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
two exacto blades I always carry two

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.010 
two exacto blades I always carry two
because<00:00:54.180> number<00:00:54.449> one<00:00:54.480> they<00:00:54.719> have<00:00:54.809> different

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
because number one they have different

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.170 
because number one they have different
angles<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:55.800> it's<00:00:55.949> much<00:00:56.219> more<00:00:56.250> easy<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:57.059> make

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
angles so it's much more easy to make

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.200 
angles so it's much more easy to make
diverse<00:00:57.570> projects<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.260> number<00:00:59.070> two<00:00:59.309> they<00:00:59.850> are

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
diverse projects and number two they are

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.189 
diverse projects and number two they are
very<00:01:00.989> um<00:01:01.609> for<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.809> sanitation<00:01:03.809> or<00:01:04.019> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
very um for the sanitation or the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.350 
very um for the sanitation or the
cleanness<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.860> clay<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.909> best<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.270> have

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
cleanness of the clay it is best to have

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.840 
cleanness of the clay it is best to have
to<00:01:06.750> blaze<00:01:07.080> at<00:01:07.260> once<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:07.799> for<00:01:08.100> example<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.640> use

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
to blaze at once so for example I use

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.210 
to blaze at once so for example I use
this<00:01:09.060> usually<00:01:09.479> for<00:01:09.689> pastels<00:01:10.290> while<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:10.920> use

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
this usually for pastels while I use

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.539 
this usually for pastels while I use
this<00:01:11.460> for<00:01:11.729> Palmer<00:01:11.939> clay<00:01:12.560> then<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.799> have<00:01:14.070> resin

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
this for Palmer clay then I have resin

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.090 
this for Palmer clay then I have resin
on<00:01:14.760> these<00:01:15.689> are<00:01:15.840> just<00:01:15.930> Korean<00:01:16.380> brand<00:01:16.680> resin

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
on these are just Korean brand resin

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.859 
on these are just Korean brand resin
although<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:17.939> really<00:01:18.180> uncommon<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.840> find

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
although it is really uncommon to find

a<00:01:29.130> great<00:01:29.490> alternative<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:30.210> know<00:01:30.509> if<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:30.840> do

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
a great alternative you know if you do

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.399 
a great alternative you know if you do
not<00:01:31.110> own<00:01:31.350> any<00:01:31.680> TLS<00:01:32.250> like<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:33.030> don't<00:01:33.409> here's

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
not own any TLS like I don't here's

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.830 
not own any TLS like I don't here's
something<00:01:34.710> random<00:01:34.880> so<00:01:35.880> this<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.270> just<00:01:36.570> a

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
something random so this is just a

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.230 
something random so this is just a
mechanical<00:01:37.439> lead<00:01:37.650> pencil<00:01:38.159> but<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.820> like<00:01:39.030> using

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
mechanical lead pencil but I like using

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.440 
mechanical lead pencil but I like using
the<00:01:39.420> tip<00:01:39.840> this<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:41.040> great<00:01:41.460> tool<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.850> use<00:01:42.060> if
