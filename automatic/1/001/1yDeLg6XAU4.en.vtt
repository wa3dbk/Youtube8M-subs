00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
man it's just right there I think I'm

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.670 
man it's just right there I think I'm
gonna<00:00:34.730> grind<00:00:35.000> a<00:00:35.120> little<00:00:35.180> bit<00:00:35.449> out<00:00:35.690> but<00:00:35.960> I<00:00:36.230> think

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
gonna grind a little bit out but I think

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.140 
gonna grind a little bit out but I think
it's<00:00:36.890> gonna<00:00:37.070> be<00:00:37.220> cool<00:00:37.550> because<00:00:37.610> when<00:00:38.059> they

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.150 
it's gonna be cool because when they

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.210 
it's gonna be cool because when they
shape<00:00:38.449> it<00:00:38.660> I<00:00:38.900> think<00:00:39.410> that<00:00:39.440> will<00:00:39.680> take<00:00:39.860> care<00:00:40.160> of

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
shape it I think that will take care of

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.720 
shape it I think that will take care of
it

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
it

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.810 
it
so<00:00:41.269> I'm<00:00:41.449> gonna<00:00:41.600> get<00:00:42.170> a<00:00:42.199> little<00:00:42.409> hydro<00:00:43.129> dynamics

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
so I'm gonna get a little hydro dynamics

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.329 
so I'm gonna get a little hydro dynamics
on<00:00:44.000> those<00:00:44.210> edges<00:00:48.070> okay

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:49.339 
on those edges okay

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:51.789 
on those edges okay
each<00:00:49.640> one's<00:00:50.000> a<00:00:50.120> little<00:00:50.330> shaping<00:00:51.320> there<00:00:51.589> you

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:51.799 
each one's a little shaping there you

00:00:51.799 --> 00:01:13.469 
each one's a little shaping there you
Louisville<00:00:52.809> hydro<00:00:53.809> action

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:23.219 

I<00:01:13.509> think<00:01:14.229> that'll<00:01:14.500> do<00:01:14.650> the<00:01:14.799> job<00:01:15.009> now<00:01:22.229> water

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
I think that'll do the job now water

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:55.730 
I think that'll do the job now water
slicer<00:01:32.340> okay<00:01:37.320> Diddy<00:01:38.320> there
