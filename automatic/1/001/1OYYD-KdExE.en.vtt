00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.950
 Hi all, Swami, I am Alexey today, but 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.940
 as you see we are again the moment of death 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.980
 truths and 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.150
 still the mission of the post will now explain 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:15.990
 why in general I was asked to write 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.480
 a series but not with arson but with an explosion and in 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.770
 In principle, this is not very 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.230
 interested and fight. what's all the same on 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.090
 look at it as we take it out of the house 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.519
 damn canine well or not placed in 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.070
 general explosives stored here in this 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.289
 the house that is, if you look at the map then 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.949
 here is the house with our friend here is the house with 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.640
 explosives 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.410
 do not confuse it km them since me 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.930
 now the FBI uniform is not there 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.850
 Basically nothing threatens the wall here 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.440
 so with buying a leg so calm 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.510
 just enter the territory of this house 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:51.390
 and we have who else will do another one 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.449
 Is the nuance of the power I already slept stus theme 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.340
 I have now only left 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.320
 make a fire in one of two ways and 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.199
 what territories but since the past 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.710
 the way was in the last part now we 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.840
 we will build so we can always enter 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.720
 Yes, you can still be here . 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.350
 in such a way to enter again here 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.380
 here and here he is so small by all means 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.619
 inconspicuous small suitcase stands in the corner here 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.090
 we need him 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.820
 next we have him with you somehow 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.570
 take out of this house 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:30.780
 apparently because just 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.650
 look at we open the door here 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:38.090
 see he look at us and pay what 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:41.009
 Now I will demonstrate this whole thing 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.329
 strange everything is good just last time 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.829
 when i tried to go out with these 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:48.420
 Suitcase but I'm pretty 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:53.540
 aggressiveness were determined wanted 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.860
 I just probably dismember so 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.229
 I'll say one thing now 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.159
 really small now we just go with 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:05.070
 the house that we have 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:07.320
 ennobles repair and for the very 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.619
 beams we make our way again in 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.900
 the room where they kept our saval there 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.750
 the corpse is already lying 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:22.110
 the so -called false we need 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:25.680
 the bodies are also there well in principle there are more 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.340
 nobody and no so no han type we're here 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:32.250
 leave will not hurt wanted to close 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:36.900
 the door in general is now our way with you 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:39.570
 lies on by 3 to the third floor that is 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.160
 on the roof that's all you need is a roof and 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:47.910
 now we need you 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:50.910
 just just go here 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:56.010
 and let's try here what 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:57.060
 he does actually that's all in 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.010
 Basically, the difference 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:04.110
 we will set our fire on this this time 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:07.410
 it was no secret that more loudly so 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.269
 all now we can goodbye to you again 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.900
 for this chopstick do it like this 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:15.720
 Now we can open the door to you and 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.360
 just take and go down from here that is 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.739
 last time there was just such a flashlight 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:25.170
 which is rather slow and lazy 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:27.989
 broke out and now it was just even 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.750
 the window was knocked out when of course this is more 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:35.040
 loud way but still it was more 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:38.730
 some kind of quiet or something not 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.560
 I know in the style of smersh 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.720
 there are still some ready-made items 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.190
 arrange here is all about these wounds to collect 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:49.019
 raise the alarm about last time but we 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:52.470
 already left the territory itself here 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:57.000
 that's what this explosion looked like 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:58.680
 I hope you like it but 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.230
 again I liked it better 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.170
 option with fire that is with the usual 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.519
 gasoline with a regular canister that's all 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.220
 but i think this 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:10.470
 let's say midi bonus ends all 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:14.750
 thanks for watching not forget
