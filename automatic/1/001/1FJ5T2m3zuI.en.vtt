00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.710
 and employment and will be the first of your group of a part bet for little big 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.739
 player betting 10 thousand 

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:12.609
 look how pretty how nice 

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:17.820
 and if I'm from Mexico like seca and the game tennis in Spanish 6 I think it's nice and 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.210
 rouler 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.089
 badoo something like that 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:24.089
 what a good experiment and mortality to address the issue of 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:27.859
 to add friends because you suppose you know that I receive many 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:30.550
 Friendship requests to give 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.820
 and I can not always access all 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.370
 the agreement put a couple of wheels for to vergara to which the Spanish as 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.370
 God the processed p3 is the only console that I have 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.270
 then I can only give you the rescission 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.270
 shortly before this fact there was no activity 1 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.360
 i 3 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.860
 pretty pretty 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.150
 then the actor that I put for the dining room 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.560
 mubarak pretty al black ops 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.519
 I do not say daily but for the lack of boats 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.369
 and that you have to have a propeller the death rate ratio of a plan 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.840
 what do you kill hamas 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.070
 to people who die is that that is not paid and overcome in the fighting 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.740
 that's why he explained 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.950
 that is percent and that are around him one with five 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.950
 that you decide to kill in plan if you kill a day 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.590
 the news the Viennese kill aquilles is a political project 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.110
 then I'll have to have around that and if possible more 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.650
 and also from baby themes reading the message to add to the 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:33.980
 prescription 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.220
 a message saying which of them ductile the deep proportion of casualties 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.650
 deaths that you have 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.940
 just that I will make people that subject less than that proportion 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.620
 I'm really sorry said really I like each side motorpress that I have the law the 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.670
 This list is irrazoous enough or that for a certain debt 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.140
 to limit it little 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.400
 that's why it's always good to be in contact with you politicians always 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.860
 I answer in less than a day practically 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.570
 then for anything of a work is to say or if you have any complaint or something 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.229
 but that does not have is the proportion of intended logo is something else 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.829
 beneficial or what I know 

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:13.229
 can see the circuit anything and even 

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:17.229
 the couple to be determined is a nice apathy and stress that pity that there is no 

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:18.839
 finished by firemen 

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:22.579
 I think we have sought the confrontation a rough one we are with the prestige 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:24.709
 through flight live will occupy the roads
