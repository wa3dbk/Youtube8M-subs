00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.999
 the deteriorated fleet of aircraft that the Salvadoran armed force has 

00:00:03.999 --> 00:00:06.999
 it means a fiasco for those who 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:08.810
 on 

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.810
 fly them 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.960
 This noise is already familiar to mechanics who every day have to 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.539
 inspect the nine planes at 37 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.989
 that were manufactured in the United States in the 1950s has been the 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:31.019
 airplane that has accompanied us throughout the decade since the 80s by 10% 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.160
 later after the peace agreements 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.410
 but already before coming here we are in it had many hours of flight 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.480
 participated 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.480
 Vietnam War 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.020
 some have already completed 40 years of use 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.940
 the deterioration is evident and the maintenance very expensive without answer 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:52.890
 little 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.290
 then you have more expensive 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.900
 In response to these companies, two more months are celebrated 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.890
 engines from seven to 37 already need adjustment 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.890
 nor its repair costs three and a half million dollars 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.480
 to that we must add the $ 400,000 annual maintenance 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.570
 for that reason the defense ministry proposed to renew the fleet of 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.340
 aircraft to minimize the case and achieve greater efficiency in reality with 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.890
 the luso by little we can not get to a beyond the family itself 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.789
 we can work national 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:29.719
 and stay a while still prudential p fulfilling because he himself 

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:33.130
 the current template with the current one does not just reach 150 thousand 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.790
 the significant savings would be in the fuel 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.920
 since a patent 7 consumes 500 gallons per delay while a super tucano 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.870
 I would need 150 gallons 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.270
 this would help porcine exercise the national sovereignty that the waters 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.560
 Territorial 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.180
 but due to the capacity of our aircraft, we can only cover the 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.180
 half of the maritime space 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.270
 although the ones that drug dealers 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.140
 they have the money the technology and they have no scruple for you 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.369
 they shot down a plane they adduce is also 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.679
 from within the sea and even today I do not think it's convenient to launch pilots 

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:15.039
 there with nothing to shoot 

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:17.779
 but in addition to fighting drug traffickers 

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:20.979
 in humanitarian work it would be an important tool 

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:25.230
 in a matter of minutes you can have the plane there are added in the area 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.290
 making the video shot making the photo taking 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:31.949
 juste put receiving are two terms 

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:35.930
 in the communications center in the operations center miguel littÃ­n the 

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:39.159
 idea is portable they proposed making important decisions because they 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.659
 is seeing exactly what is happening 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:46.249
 In real time the need to change outdated aircraft is urgent for 

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:47.999
 the military authorities 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:50.999
 since for every hour of flight that is carried out 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:54.659
 even civilians are in danger 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:56.150
