00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.860
 we will teach how to unlock everything in 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.000
 life screen first we are a 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:15.349
 USB memory that is empty as is the 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.349
 we connect to the xbox 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:23.769
 more than we have connected we are going to 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:27.320
 configuration system configuration 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:29.450
 storage and memory unit 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:34.010
 they see him 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:35.960
 Well here we have connected to the button 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.810
 it will come out that if you want to format it 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.250
 I would have to say yes 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.250
 let's go to modern warfare 2 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.500
 to multiplayer 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:59.880
 then we go to split screen 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.690
 join the game and select the 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:07.159
 usb memory that we have connected 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:09.259
 continue we start the game 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.060
 and then we would have to throw three 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:12.890
 shots to the suicidal air not what 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.350
 would you like 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.350
 I for example when he has committed suicide 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.310
 nobody has neglected to finish in the 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:29.600
 departure 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.600
 and we understand a computer 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.729
 the usb memory that we had put it 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.729
 in the computer 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.070
 well here you will have to download this 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.510
 we give to close because if they are not 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:57.480
 spoils everything here we give to 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.790
 here I will leave the link of the two 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.680
 files that you have to download that 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.840
 they are the mp data 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.420
 and the usb tag that I already have 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.509
 downloaded 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.369
 Here I will leave it to you by deposit files in 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.060
 two link in the description of the video 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:17.360
 well here I have already downloaded 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:21.240
 we're going to a usb tap 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:25.170
 let's file open office usb 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.910
 data content 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.790
 and here 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:34.920
 to 4100 and this we pass to the desk 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.319
 okay then we were mp data what 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.030
 we execute 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.030
 and we give open 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.330
 and we find it here here is 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.390
 to open 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:52.540
 then here we have to put 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.690
 Tenth prestige or whoever wants 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.320
 then here 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.800
 in the first we would have to put all 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:04.050
 the new ones that leave us in the second 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.420

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:15.230
 let us put in the second have to 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:15.230
 put about 337 and in the third 1337 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.400
 well once we have it that way a log 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:26.580
 come and we have everything unlocked ok 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.480
 and we will know how to save when it ends 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.330
 this bar 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.989
 which is that it has already finished we have to 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.989
 wait a bit 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.600
 we will get a sign that gives us ok and what 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:46.770
 we close 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:48.659
 and we open usb tag again the same usb 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:56.019

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:02.109
 now we copy the one that we have new here 

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:04.950

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:27.160
