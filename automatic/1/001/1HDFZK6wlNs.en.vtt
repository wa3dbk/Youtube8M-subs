hello everyone and Bizet here bringing
you<00:00:02.280> a<00:00:02.370> quick<00:00:02.669> video<00:00:02.970> on<00:00:03.300> how<00:00:03.419> to<00:00:03.870> evey<00:00:04.410> train

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
you a quick video on how to evey train

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.070 
you a quick video on how to evey train
super<00:00:05.490> super<00:00:05.790> fast<00:00:05.940> so<00:00:06.330> much<00:00:06.509> faster<00:00:06.750> than

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
super super fast so much faster than

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.799 
super super fast so much faster than
super<00:00:07.379> training<00:00:07.649> and<00:00:08.610> this<00:00:09.000> is<00:00:09.240> how<00:00:09.420> you<00:00:09.480> do<00:00:09.660> it

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
super training and this is how you do it

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.450 
super training and this is how you do it
so<00:00:09.990> we're<00:00:10.139> going<00:00:10.290> back<00:00:10.469> to<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.679> old<00:00:10.830> method<00:00:11.429> of

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
so we're going back to the old method of

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.879 
so we're going back to the old method of
Eevee<00:00:12.269> training<00:00:12.750> which<00:00:12.929> is<00:00:13.110> using<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.650> power

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
Eevee training which is using the power

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.000 
Eevee training which is using the power
items<00:00:14.400> in<00:00:14.639> combination<00:00:15.360> with<00:00:15.509> poke<00:00:15.780> or<00:00:15.960> us<00:00:16.109> to

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
items in combination with poke or us to

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.120 
items in combination with poke or us to
gain<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.760> potential<00:00:18.390> 10<00:00:18.779> EVs<00:00:19.320> from<00:00:19.890> each

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
gain a potential 10 EVs from each

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.609 
gain a potential 10 EVs from each
Pokemon<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.090> encounter<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:21.990> which<00:00:22.199> has<00:00:22.350> one

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
Pokemon you encounter and which has one

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.800 
Pokemon you encounter and which has one
Eevee<00:00:22.890> so<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.400> way<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:23.609> works<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:24.240> that<00:00:24.300> if<00:00:24.689> you

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
Eevee so the way it works is that if you

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.480 
Eevee so the way it works is that if you
find<00:00:25.109> something<00:00:25.410> like<00:00:25.590> in<00:00:26.010> this<00:00:26.130> video<00:00:26.340> we're

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
find something like in this video we're

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.790 
find something like in this video we're
going<00:00:26.640> after<00:00:26.760> hop<00:00:27.060> hips<00:00:27.269> hop<00:00:27.960> hips<00:00:28.170> give<00:00:28.470> one

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
going after hop hips hop hips give one

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.500 
going after hop hips hop hips give one

if the Pokemon isn't even in the battle

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.920 
if the Pokemon isn't even in the battle
so<00:01:35.460> currently<00:01:35.909> how<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.119> have<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.390> set<00:01:36.479> up<00:01:36.750> is

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
so currently how I have it set up is

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.780 
so currently how I have it set up is
that<00:01:37.200> my<00:01:37.439> fan<00:01:37.650> tump<00:01:37.920> has<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.310> PO<00:01:38.430> cross<00:01:38.640> in<00:01:38.729> the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
that my fan tump has the PO cross in the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.550 
that my fan tump has the PO cross in the
power<00:01:38.970> band<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.450> actually<00:01:40.110> share<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.409> on

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
power band and actually share is on

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.740 
power band and actually share is on
meaning<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.579> when<00:01:41.729> my<00:01:41.850> Charizard<00:01:42.360> comes<00:01:42.600> out

meaning that when my Charizard comes out

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.600 
meaning that when my Charizard comes out
here<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.110> goes<00:01:43.560> for<00:01:43.770> heat<00:01:43.950> wave<00:01:44.130> on<00:01:44.369> these

here and goes for heat wave on these

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.700 
here and goes for heat wave on these
five<00:01:44.820> hops<00:01:45.270> they<00:01:45.689> will<00:01:45.899> all<00:01:46.079> die<00:01:46.350> in<00:01:46.409> one<00:01:46.680> hit

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
five hops they will all die in one hit

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.330 
five hops they will all die in one hit
and<00:01:47.130> boom<00:01:47.610> that's<00:01:48.210> fifty<00:01:48.840> V's<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.740> 50

and boom that's fifty V's that 50

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.399 
and boom that's fifty V's that 50
special<00:01:50.820> defense<00:01:51.090> V's<00:01:51.479> just<00:01:51.960> like<00:01:52.170> that

to go you just need something like my

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.240 
to go you just need something like my
Charizard<00:02:46.299> which<00:02:46.420> has<00:02:46.569> multi<00:02:46.930> attack

multi-hit attack sorry it just makes it

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:51.690 
multi-hit attack sorry it just makes it
a<00:02:50.200> lot<00:02:50.319> faster<00:02:50.829> it<00:02:50.920> means<00:02:51.069> you<00:02:51.129> can<00:02:51.280> clear<00:02:51.549> out

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
a lot faster it means you can clear out

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.720 
a lot faster it means you can clear out
hordes<00:02:52.060> instantly<00:02:52.599> and<00:02:53.159> that's<00:02:54.159> that's

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
hordes instantly and that's that's

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.030 
hordes instantly and that's that's
basically<00:02:55.180> that<00:02:55.299> this<00:02:55.690> is<00:02:55.870> this<00:02:56.260> is<00:02:56.500> the<00:02:56.769> best

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
basically that this is this is the best

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.539 
basically that this is this is the best
this<00:02:57.639> is<00:02:58.000> really<00:02:58.959> so<00:02:59.620> much<00:02:59.799> faster<00:03:00.010> than<00:03:00.250> super

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
this is really so much faster than super

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.849 
this is really so much faster than super
