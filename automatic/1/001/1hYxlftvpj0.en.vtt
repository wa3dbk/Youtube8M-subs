method where you signs to pretty much
make<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.630> machine<00:00:27.109> if<00:00:28.109> you<00:00:28.320> got<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.619> cactus<00:00:29.130> but

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
make a machine if you got the cactus but

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.200 
make a machine if you got the cactus but
if<00:00:29.640> i<00:00:29.789> had<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.300> cat<00:00:30.660> this<00:00:31.669> it's<00:00:32.669> would<00:00:32.910> look

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
if i had a cat this it's would look

if i had a cat this it's would look
better<00:00:33.420> watch<00:00:36.860> wait<00:00:37.860> for<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:40.010> hey<00:00:43.640> where's

pig yeah it Amos a high-paid this is
what<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.449> vending<00:00:57.780> machine<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.350> very<00:00:58.829> easy<00:00:59.129> I

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
what the vending machine is very easy I

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.880 
what the vending machine is very easy I
just<00:01:00.390> made<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.750> way<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:00.899> actually<00:01:01.230> can't<00:01:01.710> get

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
just made the way you actually can't get

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.219 
just made the way you actually can't get
in<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.190> Machine<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.550> just<00:01:02.879> still<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.210> pig<00:01:03.860> so

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
in the Machine and just still a pig so

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.070 
in the Machine and just still a pig so
this<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.260> how<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.650> works<00:01:08.420> the<00:01:09.420> signs<00:01:09.720> are

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
this is how it works the signs are

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.770 
this is how it works the signs are
hooked<00:01:10.380> up<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:11.130> this<00:01:11.340> part<00:01:11.700> 2<00:01:12.060> whereas<00:01:12.479> and

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
hooked up to this part 2 whereas and

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.230 
hooked up to this part 2 whereas and
block<00:01:13.080> would<00:01:13.530> have<00:01:13.650> bent<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.700> i'll<00:01:14.909> just<00:01:14.939> go

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
block would have bent so i'll just go

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.789 
block would have bent so i'll just go
ahead<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.479> show<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.810> what<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.200> little<00:01:16.590> bit

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.010 
ahead and show you what it little bit
bend<00:01:17.040> like<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:19.430> no<00:01:20.430> maybe<00:01:20.850> not<00:01:20.939> will<00:01:21.840> look

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
bend like that no maybe not will look

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.190 
bend like that no maybe not will look
something<00:01:22.320> like<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:23.479> good

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
and can't go to juvie on the block and

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.510 
and can't go to juvie on the block and
just<00:01:46.460> like<00:01:46.640> get<00:01:47.630> down<00:01:47.869> there<00:01:48.140> and<00:01:48.200> place<00:01:48.799> a<00:01:49.190> few

just like get down there and place a few

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.690 
just like get down there and place a few
blocks<00:01:49.840> that

oh<00:02:10.110> yeah<00:02:11.110> no<00:02:13.710> regularly<00:02:14.710> there<00:02:15.100> would<00:02:15.310> have

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
oh yeah no regularly there would have

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.760 
oh yeah no regularly there would have
been<00:02:15.460> something<00:02:15.970> to<00:02:16.300> activate<00:02:16.900> it<00:02:17.110> but<00:02:17.470> I

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
been something to activate it but I

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.980 
been something to activate it but I
couldn't<00:02:18.370> so<00:02:19.000> this<00:02:19.210> time<00:02:19.360> we<00:02:19.540> just<00:02:19.780> got<00:02:19.930> to

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
couldn't so this time we just got to

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.490 
couldn't so this time we just got to
hack<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.380> system<00:02:21.120> at<00:02:22.120> least<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.720> vending

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
hack the system at least the vending

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.340 
hack the system at least the vending
machines<00:02:23.800> isn't<00:02:24.220> fair<00:02:24.490> well<00:02:25.240> I<00:02:25.540> guess<00:02:26.230> I

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
machines isn't fair well I guess I

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.760 
machines isn't fair well I guess I
really<00:02:26.590> have<00:02:26.740> to<00:02:26.770> fix<00:02:27.130> this<00:02:27.340> bug<00:02:27.610> don't<00:02:28.120> know

there and there's the pig easy as that
you<00:02:45.190> just<00:02:45.400> need<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.640> system<00:02:46.210> that<00:02:46.390> activated

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.590 

me<00:02:50.620> and<00:02:50.740> my<00:02:50.860> system<00:02:51.370> is<00:02:51.580> the<00:02:52.030> size<00:02:53.160> so<00:02:54.390> i'll<00:02:55.390> go

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
me and my system is the size so i'll go

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.030 
me and my system is the size so i'll go
ahead<00:02:55.630> and<00:02:55.870> make<00:02:56.140> what<00:02:56.290> it<00:02:56.410> should<00:02:56.680> look<00:02:56.800> them

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
ahead and make what it should look them

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.810 
ahead and make what it should look them
like<00:02:57.810> yeah<00:02:59.130> this<00:03:00.130> is<00:03:00.280> going<00:03:00.430> to<00:03:00.490> be<00:03:00.550> hard<00:03:00.760> to

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
like yeah this is going to be hard to

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:10.190 
like yeah this is going to be hard to
using<00:03:01.030> one<00:03:01.150> hand<00:03:02.490> no<00:03:06.540> there

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.630 

this<00:03:11.200> is<00:03:11.320> a<00:03:11.410> pretty<00:03:11.620> good<00:03:11.860> idea<00:03:12.160> because<00:03:12.340> the

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
this is a pretty good idea because the

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.480 
this is a pretty good idea because the
pig<00:03:12.850> doesn't<00:03:12.880> get<00:03:13.300> killed<00:03:13.660> by<00:03:13.960> the<00:03:14.020> cactus<00:03:14.590> we

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.490 
pig doesn't get killed by the cactus we

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.100 
pig doesn't get killed by the cactus we
know<00:03:15.640> the<00:03:15.760> cactus<00:03:16.120> is<00:03:16.270> opposed<00:03:16.660> to<00:03:16.780> be<00:03:16.900> there

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
know the cactus is opposed to be there

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:23.910 
know the cactus is opposed to be there
that's<00:03:17.920> why<00:03:18.070> I<00:03:19.380> kept<00:03:20.380> this<00:03:21.780> sorry<00:03:22.780> I'm<00:03:23.650> not

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
that's why I kept this sorry I'm not

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:36.080 
that's why I kept this sorry I'm not
very<00:03:24.190> good<00:03:24.460> with<00:03:24.640> this<00:03:25.090> uh<00:03:27.870> why<00:03:29.400> die<00:03:30.400> die<00:03:33.300> now
