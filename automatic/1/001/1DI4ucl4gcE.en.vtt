certain pounds or set of kicks and

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
they're all pretty much the same is how

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.719 
they're all pretty much the same is how
they<00:01:43.409> move<00:01:43.590> would<00:01:43.830> develop<00:01:44.100> speed<00:01:44.430> went<00:01:44.670> to

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
they move would develop speed went to

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.730 
they move would develop speed went to
thousand<00:01:44.970> powers<00:01:45.119> how<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.810> connect<00:01:46.259> so<00:01:46.500> it's

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
thousand powers how you connect so it's

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.039 
thousand powers how you connect so it's
really<00:01:47.100> more<00:01:47.250> important<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:48.240> do<00:01:48.360> drills<00:01:48.689> and

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
really more important to do drills and

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.080 
really more important to do drills and
understand<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.829> kind<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.100> body<00:01:50.490> work<00:01:50.759> no<00:01:51.030> it

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
understand the kind of body work no it

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.190 
understand the kind of body work no it
doesn't<00:01:51.420> work<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.689> then

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
doesn't work and then

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.620 
doesn't work and then
for<00:01:52.470> example<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:53.130> always<00:01:53.610> teach<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.180> principle

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
for example I always teach the principle

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.749 
for example I always teach the principle
of<00:01:54.869> knowing<00:01:55.770> how<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.890> focus<00:01:56.130> energy<00:01:56.460> in<00:01:56.670> your

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
of knowing how to focus energy in your

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.609

throw the shoulder twist of rest and do

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.649 
throw the shoulder twist of rest and do
that<00:02:00.860> you're<00:02:01.860> creating<00:02:02.090> basically<00:02:03.090> delays

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
that you're creating basically delays

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.320 
that you're creating basically delays
and<00:02:04.110> creating<00:02:04.590> miss<00:02:05.430> timing<00:02:05.909> with<00:02:06.000> your<00:02:06.030> bias

that should be accomplished you know it

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.800 
that should be accomplished you know it

energy it doesn't matter the substance

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.460 
energy it doesn't matter the substance
it's<00:02:26.340> still<00:02:26.550> in<00:02:26.670> it<00:02:26.790> man<00:02:27.269> they<00:02:27.870> all<00:02:28.019> follow<00:02:28.319> the

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
it's still in it man they all follow the

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.900 
it's still in it man they all follow the

same rules and they all fall same

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.600 
same rules and they all fall same
principle<00:02:30.420> so<00:02:30.900> no<00:02:31.260> matter<00:02:31.440> what<00:02:31.560> style<00:02:31.890> what

principle so no matter what style what
not<00:02:32.760> what<00:02:32.970> you're<00:02:33.150> doing<00:02:33.480> you<00:02:33.989> know<00:02:34.110> you

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
not what you're doing you know you

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.870 
not what you're doing you know you
should<00:02:34.560> do<00:02:34.709> these<00:02:34.890> drills<00:02:35.280> that<00:02:35.519> really

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
should do these drills that really

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.600 
should do these drills that really
enhances<00:02:36.540> your<00:02:36.930> your<00:02:37.709> connection<00:02:38.459> your

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
enhances your your connection your

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.670 
enhances your your connection your
structural<00:02:39.120> integrity<00:02:39.630> your<00:02:39.870> time<00:02:40.230> your

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
structural integrity your time your

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.590 
structural integrity your time your
coordination<00:02:41.160> those<00:02:42.030> are<00:02:42.269> the<00:02:42.360> things<00:02:42.480> that

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
coordination those are the things that

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.780 
coordination those are the things that
you<00:02:42.780> should<00:02:42.810> really<00:02:43.230> work<00:02:43.500> on<00:02:43.739> more<00:02:44.370> than<00:02:44.610> it

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
you should really work on more than it

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.449 
you should really work on more than it
is<00:02:45.140> do<00:02:46.140> this<00:02:46.350> move<00:02:46.620> to<00:02:46.860> this<00:02:46.950> move<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:47.370> this

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
is do this move to this move to this

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:48.949 
is do this move to this move to this
move<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.819> this<00:02:47.910> because<00:02:48.269> 9<00:02:48.450> out<00:02:48.630> of<00:02:48.690> 10<00:02:48.840> times

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
move to this because 9 out of 10 times

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.199 
move to this because 9 out of 10 times
it<00:02:49.140> doesn't<00:02:49.290> work<00:02:49.500> anyway<00:02:49.769> because<00:02:50.519> the

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
it doesn't work anyway because the

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.820 
it doesn't work anyway because the
opponent's<00:02:51.600> not<00:02:51.720> going<00:02:51.840> to<00:02:51.900> want<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.620> really

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
opponent's not going to want to really

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.380 
opponent's not going to want to really
even<00:02:53.069> let<00:02:53.220> you<00:02:53.310> have<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.549> time<00:02:53.760> to<00:02:53.880> do<00:02:54.000> it<00:02:54.030> to

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
even let you have the time to do it to

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.059 
even let you have the time to do it to
heat<00:02:54.630> my<00:02:54.660> approach<00:02:55.470> in<00:02:55.620> a<00:02:55.650> different<00:02:55.950> angle

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
heat my approach in a different angle

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.580 
heat my approach in a different angle
that<00:02:56.280> you're<00:02:56.519> used<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:56.820> intersecting<00:02:57.450> with<00:02:57.660> he

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
that you're used to intersecting with he

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.780 
that you're used to intersecting with he
might<00:02:58.739> have<00:02:58.890> a<00:02:58.920> bigger<00:02:59.160> structure<00:02:59.549> or<00:02:59.760> a

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
might have a bigger structure or a

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.310 
might have a bigger structure or a
longer<00:03:00.120> structure<00:03:00.540> shorter<00:03:00.930> structure

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
longer structure shorter structure

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.130 
longer structure shorter structure
centered<00:03:02.010> structure<00:03:02.480> you<00:03:03.480> might<00:03:03.630> be<00:03:03.810> big<00:03:03.959> or

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
centered structure you might be big or

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.199 
centered structure you might be big or
small<00:03:04.260> so<00:03:04.620> it<00:03:04.829> all<00:03:04.980> depends<00:03:05.370> but<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:06.030> most

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
small so it all depends but the most

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.880 
small so it all depends but the most
important<00:03:06.690> thing<00:03:06.840> really<00:03:07.049> it<00:03:07.290> is<00:03:07.380> is<00:03:07.560> finding

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
important thing really it is is finding

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.099 
important thing really it is is finding
that<00:03:08.130> now<00:03:08.340> in<00:03:08.790> terms<00:03:09.000> of<00:03:09.150> drills<00:03:09.540> what<00:03:09.840> we<00:03:09.930> do

emphasizes<00:03:30.660> upon<00:03:31.410> how<00:03:31.920> to<00:03:31.980> correct<00:03:32.549> the

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
emphasizes upon how to correct the

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.630 
emphasizes upon how to correct the
bottom<00:03:33.090> to<00:03:33.540> move<00:03:33.840> you<00:03:34.470> know<00:03:34.590> get<00:03:34.920> maximum

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
bottom to move you know get maximum

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.880 
bottom to move you know get maximum
effort<00:03:36.090> max<00:03:36.810> on<00:03:36.959> the<00:03:37.049> out<00:03:37.170> plug<00:03:37.380> minimal

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
effort max on the out plug minimal

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.070 
effort max on the out plug minimal
effort

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.350 

so<00:03:41.260> the<00:03:41.890> no<00:03:42.040> diagnostic<00:03:42.370> steps<00:03:42.760> I<00:03:42.970> think<00:03:43.180> with

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
so the no diagnostic steps I think with

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.480 
so the no diagnostic steps I think with
with<00:03:43.690> Allen<00:03:44.050> baby<00:03:44.230> is<00:03:44.410> not<00:03:44.860> understanding

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
with Allen baby is not understanding

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:46.860 
with Allen baby is not understanding
maybe<00:03:45.670> someone<00:03:45.910> else<00:03:46.000> watching<00:03:46.300> this<00:03:46.660> my

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
maybe someone else watching this my

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.660 
maybe someone else watching this my
understanding<00:03:47.560> is<00:03:47.680> that<00:03:47.710> this<00:03:48.250> is<00:03:48.310> just<00:03:48.580> a

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
understanding is that this is just a

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.610 
understanding is that this is just a
system<00:03:48.940> that<00:03:49.690> can<00:03:49.750> be<00:03:49.870> applied<00:03:50.230> to<00:03:50.500> what

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
system that can be applied to what

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.710 
system that can be applied to what
they're<00:03:50.740> doing<00:03:50.770> Tai<00:03:51.250> Chi<00:03:51.280> Karate<00:03:52.030> Wing<00:03:52.360> Chun

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
they're doing Tai Chi Karate Wing Chun

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.380 
they're doing Tai Chi Karate Wing Chun
no<00:03:53.650> matter<00:03:53.830> what<00:03:54.070> no<00:03:54.400> doctor<00:03:54.730> has<00:03:54.880> a<00:03:54.970> system<00:03:55.300> of

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
no matter what no doctor has a system of

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.510 
no matter what no doctor has a system of
energy<00:03:55.810> okay<00:03:56.530> it's<00:03:56.830> about<00:03:56.890> understanding<00:03:57.100> the

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
energy okay it's about understanding the

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.220 
energy okay it's about understanding the
principles<00:03:58.000> of<00:03:58.180> energy<00:03:58.570> and<00:03:58.720> how<00:03:58.900> the<00:03:58.960> body

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
principles of energy and how the body

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.560 
principles of energy and how the body
works<00:03:59.650> with<00:03:59.800> energy<00:04:00.340> and<00:04:00.490> how<00:04:01.030> it<00:04:01.180> connects

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
works with energy and how it connects

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.110 
works with energy and how it connects
with<00:04:01.810> another<00:04:02.380> object<00:04:02.560> of<00:04:02.890> managing<00:04:03.280> that's

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
with another object of managing that's

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.070 
with another object of managing that's
what<00:04:04.270> they're<00:04:04.390> gonna<00:04:04.510> do

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
what they're gonna do

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.920 
what they're gonna do
it's<00:04:05.470> not<00:04:05.680> a<00:04:05.710> method<00:04:06.580> of<00:04:06.850> oh<00:04:07.150> you<00:04:07.510> have<00:04:07.750> to

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
it's not a method of oh you have to

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.210 
it's not a method of oh you have to
punch<00:04:08.140> this<00:04:08.260> well<00:04:08.470> you<00:04:08.530> have<00:04:08.740> to<00:04:08.890> punch<00:04:09.070> out

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
punch this well you have to punch out

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.300 
punch this well you have to punch out
like<00:04:09.430> you<00:04:09.940> know<00:04:09.970> I<00:04:10.090> like<00:04:10.300> to<00:04:10.330> say<00:04:10.980> pick<00:04:11.980> any<00:04:12.130> two

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
like you know I like to say pick any two

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.220 
like you know I like to say pick any two
numbers<00:04:12.460> into<00:04:12.790> 10<00:04:13.030> somebody<00:04:13.720> might<00:04:13.840> say<00:04:13.960> 5<00:04:14.200> or

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
numbers into 10 somebody might say 5 or

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.310 
numbers into 10 somebody might say 5 or
5<00:04:14.500> well<00:04:14.740> why<00:04:15.040> not<00:04:15.070> get<00:04:15.340> to<00:04:15.610> over<00:04:16.090> 9<00:04:16.299> 7<00:04:16.600> 3<00:04:16.630> it

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
5 well why not get to over 9 7 3 it

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.140 
5 well why not get to over 9 7 3 it
doesn't<00:04:17.890> matter<00:04:18.070> as<00:04:18.310> long<00:04:18.340> as<00:04:18.580> Maxwell's

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
doesn't matter as long as Maxwell's

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.539 
doesn't matter as long as Maxwell's
right<00:04:19.420> and<00:04:19.959> it'll<00:04:20.110> work<00:04:20.350> but<00:04:21.040> some<00:04:21.250> people

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
right and it'll work but some people

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.030 
right and it'll work but some people
know<00:04:21.820> what<00:04:21.970> has<00:04:22.120> to<00:04:22.270> be<00:04:22.330> 5<00:04:22.570> in<00:04:22.720> 5<00:04:22.900> it<00:04:23.470> has<00:04:23.530> to<00:04:23.980> be

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
know what has to be 5 in 5 it has to be

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.610 
know what has to be 5 in 5 it has to be
or<00:04:24.520> something<00:04:25.450> I<00:04:25.570> wanna<00:04:25.720> say<00:04:25.870> it<00:04:25.930> has<00:04:26.080> to<00:04:26.110> be<00:04:26.350> 10

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
or something I wanna say it has to be 10

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.530 
or something I wanna say it has to be 10
and<00:04:26.650> zero<00:04:27.010> because<00:04:27.580> it's<00:04:27.760> simple<00:04:28.150> in<00:04:28.210> that<00:04:28.390> way

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
and zero because it's simple in that way

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.420 
and zero because it's simple in that way
well<00:04:29.050> yeah<00:04:29.380> it<00:04:29.560> can<00:04:29.710> be<00:04:29.800> simple<00:04:30.130> but<00:04:30.310> not

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
well yeah it can be simple but not

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.330 
well yeah it can be simple but not
necessary<00:04:30.970> won't<00:04:31.150> be<00:04:31.270> effective<00:04:31.750> I<00:04:31.960> mean<00:04:32.770> so

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
necessary won't be effective I mean so

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.240 
necessary won't be effective I mean so
it<00:04:33.790> has<00:04:34.030> to<00:04:34.300> be<00:04:34.480> right<00:04:35.200> Mac

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
it has to be right Mac

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.780 
it has to be right Mac
it<00:04:36.550> has<00:04:36.850> two<00:04:37.090> antennas<00:04:37.810> overworld<00:04:38.580> 5:05<00:04:39.580> ago

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
it has two antennas overworld 5:05 ago

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.300 
it has two antennas overworld 5:05 ago
it<00:04:39.970> depends<00:04:40.240> on<00:04:40.300> just<00:04:40.630> the<00:04:41.260> application<00:04:41.980> of

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
it depends on just the application of

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
it depends on just the application of
how<00:04:42.430> you<00:04:42.490> want<00:04:42.670> your<00:04:43.510> protein<00:04:43.900> so<00:04:44.790> it<00:04:45.790> depends

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
how you want your protein so it depends

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.710 
how you want your protein so it depends
you<00:04:46.630> know<00:04:46.660> on<00:04:47.590> how<00:04:48.340> you're<00:04:48.580> going<00:04:48.700> to<00:04:48.790> deal

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
you know on how you're going to deal

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.200 
you know on how you're going to deal
with<00:04:49.750> energy<00:04:50.110> and<00:04:50.520> basically<00:04:51.520> a<00:04:51.760> lot<00:04:52.000> of<00:04:52.030> it

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
with energy and basically a lot of it

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.660 
with energy and basically a lot of it
depends<00:04:52.510> on<00:04:52.630> you<00:04:53.070> okay

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
depends on you okay

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.210 
depends on you okay
they're<00:04:55.270> in<00:04:55.600> the<00:04:55.750> rent<00:04:55.960> your<00:04:56.350> direct<00:04:56.710> for

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
they're in the rent your direct for

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.350 
they're in the rent your direct for
example<00:04:57.610> when<00:04:57.760> someone<00:04:57.940> throws<00:04:58.150> a<00:04:58.210> whole

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
example when someone throws a whole

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.270 
example when someone throws a whole
bunch<00:04:58.600> of<00:04:58.690> you<00:04:58.840> how<00:04:59.500> heavy<00:04:59.830> is<00:05:00.040> it

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
bunch of you how heavy is it

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.240 
bunch of you how heavy is it
it<00:05:01.120> depends<00:05:01.510> on<00:05:01.570> what<00:05:01.780> your<00:05:01.960> whole<00:05:02.140> the<00:05:02.950> harder

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
it depends on what your whole the harder

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.250 
it depends on what your whole the harder
you<00:05:03.370> resist<00:05:03.820> of<00:05:03.970> having<00:05:04.240> the<00:05:04.330> punch<00:05:04.510> but<00:05:05.020> you

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
you resist of having the punch but you

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.690 
you resist of having the punch but you
can't<00:05:05.440> want<00:05:05.560> to<00:05:05.590> move<00:05:05.890> with<00:05:05.920> it<00:05:06.130> the<00:05:06.430> lighter

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
can't want to move with it the lighter

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.940 
can't want to move with it the lighter
it<00:05:06.910> feels<00:05:07.150> and<00:05:07.600> I<00:05:07.750> can<00:05:07.900> attest<00:05:08.140> to<00:05:08.410> what<00:05:08.710> you're

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
it feels and I can attest to what you're

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.410 
it feels and I can attest to what you're
saying<00:05:09.130> because<00:05:09.400> when<00:05:09.760> I've<00:05:10.150> been<00:05:10.300> learning

saying because when I've been learning
with<00:05:10.810> Larry<00:05:11.140> he<00:05:11.560> shows<00:05:11.800> me<00:05:12.070> okay<00:05:12.490> I'm<00:05:13.000> not

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
with Larry he shows me okay I'm not

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.150 
with Larry he shows me okay I'm not
doing<00:05:13.510> this<00:05:13.690> you're<00:05:13.930> actually<00:05:14.290> doing<00:05:14.770> it<00:05:15.010> let

doing this you're actually doing it let

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.160 
doing this you're actually doing it let
me<00:05:15.250> drag<00:05:15.490> it<00:05:15.520> out<00:05:15.820> so<00:05:15.850> it's<00:05:16.540> a<00:05:16.630> misconception

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:17.170 
me drag it out so it's a misconception

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.930 
me drag it out so it's a misconception
that<00:05:17.410> someone<00:05:17.770> can<00:05:17.920> punch<00:05:18.130> ball<00:05:18.430> nobody<00:05:18.820> could

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
that someone can punch ball nobody could

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.400 
that someone can punch ball nobody could
punch<00:05:19.120> strong<00:05:19.480> they<00:05:19.840> go<00:05:19.960> with<00:05:20.080> a<00:05:20.140> punch<00:05:20.320> of

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
punch strong they go with a punch of

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.070 
punch strong they go with a punch of
fast<00:05:20.680> and<00:05:21.010> become<00:05:21.940> strong<00:05:22.270> when<00:05:22.690> it<00:05:22.720> needs<00:05:22.990> a

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
fast and become strong when it needs a

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.320 
fast and become strong when it needs a
resistance<00:05:23.560> force<00:05:23.860> so<00:05:24.700> the<00:05:24.790> more<00:05:25.000> you<00:05:25.180> resist

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
resistance force so the more you resist

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.480 
resistance force so the more you resist
the<00:05:25.780> stronger<00:05:26.230> feel<00:05:26.470> like<00:05:26.710> less<00:05:27.010> who<00:05:27.190> is<00:05:27.310> this

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
the stronger feel like less who is this

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.030 
the stronger feel like less who is this
-<00:05:28.330> less<00:05:28.510> it<00:05:28.720> feels<00:05:28.960> and<00:05:29.200> these<00:05:29.620> are<00:05:29.800> the<00:05:29.860> things

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:30.040 
- less it feels and these are the things

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.130 
- less it feels and these are the things
that<00:05:30.250> you<00:05:30.610> know<00:05:30.700> we<00:05:30.820> teach<00:05:31.030> you<00:05:31.210> in<00:05:31.540> the<00:05:31.900> movie

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
all facts it's not oh this is what I

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.880 
all facts it's not oh this is what I
believe<00:05:36.190> that's<00:05:37.180> not<00:05:37.390> it's<00:05:38.350> not<00:05:38.500> there's<00:05:38.770> no

arguing<00:05:39.220> silence<00:05:39.610> okay<00:05:40.060> if<00:05:40.390> you<00:05:40.540> argue<00:05:40.720> in

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
arguing silence okay if you argue in

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.800 
arguing silence okay if you argue in
science<00:05:41.380> and

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
science and

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.030 
science and
well<00:05:43.020> then<00:05:43.140> you're<00:05:43.260> being<00:05:43.380> stubborn<00:05:43.650> you<00:05:44.010> know

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:44.040 
well then you're being stubborn you know

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.280 
well then you're being stubborn you know
didn't<00:05:44.370> let<00:05:44.490> that's<00:05:44.670> on<00:05:44.820> you<00:05:44.970> but<00:05:45.720> you<00:05:46.080> can't

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
didn't let that's on you but you can't

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:47.660 
didn't let that's on you but you can't
argue<00:05:46.470> the<00:05:46.650> science<00:05:46.980> you<00:05:47.040> know<00:05:47.190> we<00:05:47.340> backed<00:05:47.550> up

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:47.670 
argue the science you know we backed up

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:48.890 
argue the science you know we backed up
everything<00:05:47.880> through<00:05:48.180> what<00:05:48.300> we<00:05:48.420> do<00:05:48.660> through

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
everything through what we do through

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.650 
everything through what we do through
science<00:05:49.380> through<00:05:49.560> physics<00:05:50.340> you<00:05:50.940> know<00:05:51.150> so<00:05:51.540> how

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
science through physics you know so how

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.990 
science through physics you know so how
the<00:05:51.720> body<00:05:51.960> works<00:05:52.260> so<00:05:52.680> that<00:05:52.710> energy<00:05:53.010> so<00:05:53.490> there's

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
the body works so that energy so there's

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.130 
the body works so that energy so there's
there's<00:05:54.480> no<00:05:54.630> argument<00:05:55.200> principles<00:05:55.770> of<00:05:55.890> energy

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:57.140 
there's no argument principles of energy

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.350 
there's no argument principles of energy
