00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.389
 this matter of remold tires is fine 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.389
 interesting 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.500
 starts the tire reform 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.480
 through the bad phase in-band phase 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.380
 of old tire tread 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.090
 December shooting with him and it is also 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.550
 side tire hoes 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.880
 after the bland industry with the 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.660
 creation sector that would be the finishing 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.989
 rafah end of the industry and where it is also 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.719
 done the county fix a nail in the 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.450
 period in this sector that is made 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.399
 tire repair 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:48.660
 after that he was a glue teacher where 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:51.989
 apply non-tire glue and after 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:57.000
 finished the time is applied to rubber 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:59.670
 the tread and the tire label or 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.989
 whether it is the rubber film that 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.869
 around the tire is where 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.360
 organization is recorded the name of the company 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.479
 the inmetro certificate number 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.830
 the tire expects to indicate from the 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.900
 Tire teaches tire speed is the dowry 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.860
 family is not the date of manufacture 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.420
 is the one where the tire in him 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.659
 looks exactly like a 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:32.220
 new new tire then for you to know 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:35.640
 that the tire remolded it in engraving 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.600
 the new stick to the tire the word is 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.920
 molded 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:44.280
 this is a requirement of inmetro that 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.079
 certifies the company that it comes from 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.470
 consumer information 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.590
 the tire is renewed there are some 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.680
 differences right 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.030
 begins with Rio de Janeiro, the new tire is 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.200
 new 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.330
 opine wheeled on a retired tire he 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.990
 keep the same characteristic a tire 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.960
 new 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.720
 or is it is to sell for use in the same type 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:14.790
 vehicle with load index and 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:17.240
 equal speed and that it has 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.500
 practically the same tire life 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.750
 new 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.740
 provided that it is companies which are 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.270
 front that is the company that is 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.700
 certified by inmetro and follows 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.710
 rigorously meet the quality standards of 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.410
 tire production process 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.630
 the risk of the tire and motor is practically the 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.780
 same risk of a new tire bursting 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.900
 there are only some conditions 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.880
 so this can happen right? 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:51.680
 mainly the lack of care for 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:55.530
 The user 's part is to calibrate the tire. 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.590
 speed is the weight of the car is also 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.990
 loading is the issue of alignment 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.780
 of the car the question of balancing 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:07.370
 said influence ne 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:10.170
 on the question of durability 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.590
 so it is very difficult as the tire 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.330
 burst simply by having 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.820
 again when it happens that it is very 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.280
 difficult also when the term 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:24.959
 the tire has come along with it 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:27.260
 consumer problems of the tire or 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.260
 vehicle 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.110
 company which is certified by the 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:36.220
 inmetro and goes through an audit of the event 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:39.610
 where is the metro to see singles 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.890
 losing it with the tires and sending 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.960
 press accredited by Inmetro to 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:50.830
 do the tire quality tests 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:53.830
 this process is that the company 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:57.490
 certified for the production of 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:01.600
 tires and eventually an audit is made 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:05.170
 surprise in the company there is 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:08.080
 every six months inmetro makes a 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.030
 Audit surprise addition to the brother he 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.430
 company lamented the process of 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.650
 production of the raw material that is 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.900
 here again a few tires 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.470
 chosen because it is randomly 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:24.960
 they are sent to laboratories there 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.960
 test and channel quality
