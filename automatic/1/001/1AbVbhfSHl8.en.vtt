00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:03.760 

the<00:00:02.129> part<00:00:02.399> one<00:00:02.550> I<00:00:02.580> showed<00:00:02.970> you<00:00:03.179> how<00:00:03.449> to<00:00:03.480> make

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:03.770 
the part one I showed you how to make

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.849 
the part one I showed you how to make
symmetrical<00:00:04.770> patterns<00:00:05.779> but<00:00:06.779> on<00:00:07.020> just<00:00:07.710> a<00:00:07.830> few

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
symmetrical patterns but on just a few

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.129 
symmetrical patterns but on just a few
hours<00:00:08.069> after<00:00:08.400> making<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:08.970> video<00:00:09.179> I<00:00:09.630> kind<00:00:10.019> of

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
hours after making a video I kind of

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.890 
hours after making a video I kind of
figured<00:00:10.500> out<00:00:10.790> how<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:11.849> do<00:00:12.059> some<00:00:12.389> other<00:00:12.660> ones

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
figured out how to do some other ones

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.310 
figured out how to do some other ones
that<00:00:13.110> on<00:00:13.290> they<00:00:14.009> don't<00:00:14.190> not<00:00:14.639> symmetrical<00:00:15.320> so

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
that on they don't not symmetrical so

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.609 
that on they don't not symmetrical so
let<00:00:16.770> me<00:00:16.859> show<00:00:16.949> you<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.160> e<00:00:17.430> I'm<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.510> key<00:00:18.810> same

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
let me show you the e I'm a key same

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.070 
let me show you the e I'm a key same
method<00:00:19.949> that<00:00:20.279> I<00:00:20.340> explained<00:00:20.910> in<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.869> first

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
method that I explained in the first

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.689 
method that I explained in the first
video<00:00:25.070> and<00:00:27.859> like<00:00:28.859> in<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.220> first<00:00:29.400> video<00:00:29.519> I

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
video and like in the first video I

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.580 
video and like in the first video I
showed<00:00:30.000> you<00:00:30.109> the<00:00:31.109> B<00:00:31.850> how<00:00:32.960> do<00:00:33.960> we<00:00:34.050> need<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.410> turn

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
showed you the B how do we need you turn

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.180 
showed you the B how do we need you turn
it<00:00:34.680> upside<00:00:34.920> down<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:36.030> works<00:00:36.800> because<00:00:37.800> it's

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
it upside down and it works because it's

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.580 
it upside down and it works because it's
mirrored<00:00:38.579> so<00:00:39.059> these<00:00:39.480> ones<00:00:39.690> these<00:00:40.050> three<00:00:40.350> sides

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
mirrored so these ones these three sides

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.030 
mirrored so these ones these three sides
work<00:00:40.829> but<00:00:41.730> these<00:00:42.030> ones<00:00:42.180> are<00:00:42.270> backwards<00:00:42.739> so<00:00:43.739> on

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
work but these ones are backwards so on

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.400 
work but these ones are backwards so on
if<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.850> turn<00:00:45.030> upside<00:00:45.390> down<00:00:45.420> like<00:00:45.840> i<00:00:45.989> showed<00:00:46.170> in

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
if you turn upside down like i showed in

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.660 
if you turn upside down like i showed in
the<00:00:46.590> other<00:00:46.739> video<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.789> works<00:00:48.030> but<00:00:48.660> there's<00:00:49.260> a

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
the other video it works but there's a

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.939 
the other video it works but there's a
there's<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.760> better<00:00:51.059> way<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:52.079> do<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.320> where<00:00:52.530> you

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
there's a better way to do it where you

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.470 
there's a better way to do it where you
don't<00:00:53.100> need<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.250> turn<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.489> upside<00:00:53.730> down<00:00:53.760> there

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
don't need to turn it upside down there

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.439 
don't need to turn it upside down there
all<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:55.410> right<00:00:55.590> way<00:00:55.760> just<00:00:56.760> like<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.000> i'll

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
all the right way just like that i'll

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.830 
all the right way just like that i'll
show<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.690> how<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.840> make<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:58.969> good<00:00:59.969> what<00:01:00.270> all

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
show you how to make that good what all

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.689 
show you how to make that good what all
you<00:01:01.020> do<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.469> before<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.430> sign<00:01:02.609> of

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
you do is before you the sign of

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.700 
you do is before you the sign of
switching<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.090> have<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.300> turn<00:01:03.510> each<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.619> these

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
switching you have to turn each of these

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.340 
switching you have to turn each of these
sizes<00:01:05.129> left<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:06.090> back<00:01:06.299> on<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.840> bottom<00:01:07.110> you

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
sizes left the back on the bottom you

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.469 
sizes left the back on the bottom you
have<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.530> turn<00:01:07.680> them<00:01:07.830> 180<00:01:08.310> degrees<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:09.450> it

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
have to turn them 180 degrees so it

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.550 
have to turn them 180 degrees so it
doesn't<00:01:09.750> matter<00:01:09.869> what<00:01:09.990> order<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.320> do<00:01:10.439> that

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
doesn't matter what order you do that

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.740 
doesn't matter what order you do that
just<00:01:10.590> making<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.520> an<00:01:12.090> order<00:01:12.330> so<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.600> can

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
just making it an order so you can

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.710 
just making it an order so you can
memorize<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:14.369> can<00:01:14.520> remember<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.180> undo<00:01:15.570> it

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
memorize it you can remember to undo it

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.539 
memorize it you can remember to undo it
afterwards<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.920> let<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:17.790> did<00:01:18.000> left<00:01:18.710> back<00:01:19.710> and

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
afterwards so let I did left back and

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.609 
afterwards so let I did left back and
bottom<00:01:22.009> so<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.159> undo<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:24.090> would<00:01:24.570> do<00:01:24.750> bottom

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
bottom so to undo that I would do bottom

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.520 
bottom so to undo that I would do bottom
back<00:01:25.920> left<00:01:26.540> so<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.570> just<00:01:27.750> remember<00:01:28.049> bottom<00:01:28.380> back

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
back left so I just remember bottom back

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.180 
back left so I just remember bottom back
left<00:01:28.799> then<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.340> make<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.640> e<00:01:29.670> like<00:01:30.180> normal

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.990 

down<00:01:36.190> left<00:01:36.400> upright<00:01:36.640> again<00:01:38.610> then<00:01:39.610> i'm<00:01:39.700> gonna<00:01:39.850> i

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
down left upright again then i'm gonna i

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.280 
down left upright again then i'm gonna i
just<00:01:40.180> made<00:01:40.300> line<00:01:40.540> i'm<00:01:40.810> going<00:01:40.960> to<00:01:41.020> make<00:01:41.140> the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
just made line i'm going to make the

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:49.830 
just made line i'm going to make the
three<00:01:41.620> little<00:01:41.800> horizontal<00:01:42.580> line<00:01:48.690> it<00:01:49.690> gets

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
three little horizontal line it gets

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.890 
three little horizontal line it gets
kind<00:01:49.990> of<00:01:50.110> messy<00:01:50.170> but<00:01:50.710> go<00:01:51.580> just<00:01:52.030> kind<00:01:52.210> of<00:01:52.240> try<00:01:52.870> to

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
kind of messy but go just kind of try to

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.940 
kind of messy but go just kind of try to
keep<00:01:53.110> track<00:01:53.350> of<00:01:53.380> it<00:01:56.160> okay<00:01:57.160> so<00:01:57.220> i'm<00:01:57.430> a<00:01:57.490> te<00:01:57.640> now

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
keep track of it okay so i'm a te now

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:08.160 
keep track of it okay so i'm a te now
bottom<00:02:01.620> back<00:02:04.110> left<00:02:05.940> so<00:02:06.940> these<00:02:07.450> are<00:02:07.510> still<00:02:08.020> the

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
bottom back left so these are still the

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.010 
bottom back left so these are still the
same<00:02:08.380> as<00:02:08.710> it<00:02:09.130> was<00:02:09.310> last<00:02:09.340> time<00:02:09.850> but<00:02:10.660> these<00:02:10.780> ones

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
same as it was last time but these ones

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.220 
same as it was last time but these ones
are<00:02:11.350> there<00:02:12.310> right<00:02:12.550> now<00:02:12.820> their<00:02:13.390> rights<00:02:13.600> they're

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
are there right now their rights they're

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.450 
are there right now their rights they're
not<00:02:14.350> married<00:02:15.100> so<00:02:15.600> that<00:02:16.680> you<00:02:17.680> use<00:02:18.040> that<00:02:18.070> method

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
not married so that you use that method

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.420 
not married so that you use that method
for<00:02:18.850> letters<00:02:19.210> that<00:02:19.990> have<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.830> horizontal

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
for letters that have the horizontal

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.770 
for letters that have the horizontal
line<00:02:21.550> of<00:02:21.670> symmetry<00:02:21.790> so<00:02:22.210> they're<00:02:22.330> reflected

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
line of symmetry so they're reflected

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.710 
line of symmetry so they're reflected
from<00:02:22.870> top<00:02:23.110> to<00:02:23.140> bottom<00:02:23.290> like<00:02:24.130> the<00:02:24.280> be<00:02:24.640> the<00:02:25.030> E<00:02:25.060> and

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
from top to bottom like the be the E and

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.890 
from top to bottom like the be the E and
D<00:02:26.590> and<00:02:27.070> other<00:02:27.160> letters<00:02:27.460> like<00:02:27.580> that<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:28.720> I<00:02:28.870> know

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
D and other letters like that and I know

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.770 
D and other letters like that and I know
to<00:02:29.110> mix<00:02:29.350> symmetrical<00:02:30.190> letters<00:02:30.430> but<00:02:31.270> letters

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
to mix symmetrical letters but letters

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.450 
to mix symmetrical letters but letters
like<00:02:32.410> Jay<00:02:33.040> and<00:02:33.540> like<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:34.690> Z<00:02:35.340> letters<00:02:36.340> like

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
like Jay and like the Z letters like

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.490 
like Jay and like the Z letters like
that<00:02:36.520> there<00:02:37.480> are<00:02:37.690> more<00:02:38.320> complicated<00:02:38.790> so

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
that there are more complicated so

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.150 
that there are more complicated so
here's<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.709> J<00:02:41.980> um<00:02:43.140> see<00:02:44.140> these<00:02:44.590> three<00:02:44.800> sides

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
here's the J um see these three sides

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.800 
here's the J um see these three sides
it's<00:02:45.550> good<00:02:45.820> but<00:02:46.570> these<00:02:47.500> besides<00:02:47.980> it<00:02:48.340> smeared

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
it's good but these besides it smeared

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.400 
it's good but these besides it smeared
so<00:02:49.810> i'll<00:02:50.800> show<00:02:51.010> you<00:02:51.070> how<00:02:51.220> to<00:02:51.370> make<00:02:52.360> JS<00:02:53.020> on<00:02:53.260> all

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
so i'll show you how to make JS on all

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.130 
so i'll show you how to make JS on all
sides<00:02:53.680> correctly<00:02:54.550> so<00:02:55.420> i'll<00:02:55.810> show<00:02:55.959> you<00:02:56.020> that

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
sides correctly so i'll show you that

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.830 
sides correctly so i'll show you that
next<00:02:57.000> what<00:02:58.000> i<00:02:58.030> do<00:02:58.150> to<00:02:58.270> make<00:02:58.570> the<00:02:58.690> JS<00:02:58.989> is<00:03:00.450> um<00:03:01.450> well

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
next what i do to make the JS is um well

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.060 
next what i do to make the JS is um well
first<00:03:01.870> you<00:03:02.290> start<00:03:02.440> off<00:03:02.590> by<00:03:02.830> doing<00:03:03.700> the<00:03:04.120> five

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
first you start off by doing the five

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:12.070 
first you start off by doing the five
squares<00:03:06.070> on<00:03:06.220> top<00:03:06.430> first<00:03:07.110> like<00:03:08.110> normal

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.400 

so<00:03:13.040> I<00:03:13.100> did<00:03:13.280> those<00:03:13.490> and<00:03:14.000> then<00:03:14.300> the<00:03:14.900> vertical

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
so I did those and then the vertical

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:24.690 
so I did those and then the vertical
three<00:03:16.040> middle<00:03:16.400> ones<00:03:17.620> down<00:03:18.620> left<00:03:18.890> upright<00:03:22.360> okay

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
three middle ones down left upright okay

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.180 
three middle ones down left upright okay
normally<00:03:25.700> I<00:03:25.910> would<00:03:26.510> want<00:03:26.660> to<00:03:26.720> switch<00:03:27.190> this

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
normally I would want to switch this

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.970 
normally I would want to switch this
square<00:03:28.640> I<00:03:29.140> want<00:03:30.140> to<00:03:30.230> I<00:03:30.440> want<00:03:30.470> to<00:03:30.680> switch<00:03:30.830> this

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
square I want to I want to switch this

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.360 
square I want to I want to switch this
one<00:03:31.190> and<00:03:31.430> this<00:03:31.880> one<00:03:32.110> these<00:03:33.110> two<00:03:33.380> to<00:03:33.890> make<00:03:34.040> the<00:03:34.160> J

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
one and this one these two to make the J

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.360 
one and this one these two to make the J
but<00:03:35.120> then<00:03:35.360> with<00:03:36.260> the<00:03:36.290> mirrored<00:03:36.830> sides<00:03:37.070> that

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
but then with the mirrored sides that

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.110 
but then with the mirrored sides that
would<00:03:37.550> switch<00:03:37.870> this<00:03:38.870> piece<00:03:39.170> and<00:03:39.560> this<00:03:39.770> piece

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
would switch this piece and this piece

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.970 
would switch this piece and this piece
so<00:03:41.120> if<00:03:41.960> I<00:03:42.110> know<00:03:42.170> these<00:03:42.410> two<00:03:42.620> are<00:03:42.770> going<00:03:42.860> to<00:03:42.920> be

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
so if I know these two are going to be

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.840 
so if I know these two are going to be
switched<00:03:43.340> and<00:03:43.670> if<00:03:44.180> I<00:03:44.270> turn<00:03:44.480> to<00:03:44.630> this<00:03:45.400> side<00:03:46.400> once

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
switched and if I turn to this side once

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.750 
switched and if I turn to this side once
then<00:03:47.690> these<00:03:48.500> two<00:03:48.560> pieces<00:03:49.010> would<00:03:49.310> be<00:03:49.460> switched

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
then these two pieces would be switched

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.510 
then these two pieces would be switched
and<00:03:50.060> that<00:03:50.750> would<00:03:50.900> make<00:03:51.050> the<00:03:51.470> J<00:03:51.740> with<00:03:52.160> these<00:03:52.340> two

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
and that would make the J with these two

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.350 
and that would make the J with these two
switch<00:03:52.820> so<00:03:53.690> if<00:03:54.080> i<00:03:54.290> didn't<00:03:54.800> know<00:03:54.830> that<00:03:55.209> if<00:03:56.209> I

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
switch so if i didn't know that if I

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.380 
switch so if i didn't know that if I
turn<00:03:56.540> this<00:03:56.570> side<00:03:57.040> counterclockwise<00:03:58.040> in<00:03:58.640> the

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
turn this side counterclockwise in the

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.820 
turn this side counterclockwise in the
back<00:03:59.690> counterclockwise<00:04:00.160> from<00:04:01.160> the<00:04:01.360> beyond

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
back counterclockwise from the beyond

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.350 
back counterclockwise from the beyond
yeah<00:04:03.830> counterclockwise<00:04:04.280> and<00:04:04.790> then<00:04:05.270> the

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
yeah counterclockwise and then the

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.730 
yeah counterclockwise and then the
bottom<00:04:05.720> counterclockwise<00:04:07.360> then<00:04:08.360> I<00:04:08.750> can<00:04:09.230> make

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
bottom counterclockwise then I can make

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.360 
bottom counterclockwise then I can make
the<00:04:09.890> J<00:04:10.160> just<00:04:10.790> cycle<00:04:11.180> these<00:04:11.300> two<00:04:11.540> pieces<00:04:11.750> and<00:04:12.370> it

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
the J just cycle these two pieces and it

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.460 
the J just cycle these two pieces and it
should<00:04:13.610> work<00:04:13.790> so<00:04:15.010> the<00:04:16.010> same<00:04:16.250> method<00:04:17.200> down<00:04:18.200> left

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
should work so the same method down left

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:28.360 
should work so the same method down left
up<00:04:19.190> right<00:04:20.049> to<00:04:21.049> go<00:04:21.200> to<00:04:21.260> those<00:04:21.500> squares

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.999 

okay<00:04:29.370> so<00:04:29.910> i<00:04:29.940> got<00:04:30.120> the<00:04:30.210> j<00:04:30.479> on<00:04:31.319> these<00:04:31.560> three<00:04:31.770> sides

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:32.009 
okay so i got the j on these three sides

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:34.850 
okay so i got the j on these three sides
and<00:04:32.880> now<00:04:32.940> i<00:04:32.970> have<00:04:33.090> to<00:04:33.270> undo<00:04:33.660> them<00:04:34.020> the<00:04:34.620> setup

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
and now i have to undo them the setup

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.779 
and now i have to undo them the setup
moves<00:04:35.099> so<00:04:36.470> clockwise<00:04:37.470> from<00:04:38.039> the<00:04:38.190> bottom<00:04:38.490> in

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
moves so clockwise from the bottom in

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:41.450 
moves so clockwise from the bottom in
the<00:04:38.910> back<00:04:39.150> clockwise<00:04:39.840> and<00:04:40.250> the<00:04:41.250> left

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
the back clockwise and the left

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.439 
the back clockwise and the left
clockwise<00:04:41.849> and<00:04:42.740> these<00:04:43.740> times<00:04:43.949> are<00:04:44.039> good<00:04:44.449> but

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:45.449 
clockwise and these times are good but

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:48.770 
clockwise and these times are good but
and<00:04:45.690> these<00:04:45.990> sides<00:04:46.259> are<00:04:46.590> also<00:04:46.770> good<00:04:47.300> so<00:04:48.300> that's

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
and these sides are also good so that's

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.800 
and these sides are also good so that's
how<00:04:48.900> i<00:04:49.259> make<00:04:49.949> you<00:04:50.490> can<00:04:50.669> use<00:04:51.060> it<00:04:51.240> you<00:04:51.539> can<00:04:51.690> do

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
how i make you can use it you can do

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.080 
how i make you can use it you can do
that<00:04:51.990> for<00:04:52.199> certain<00:04:52.380> letters<00:04:52.849> some<00:04:53.849> of<00:04:53.970> them

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
that for certain letters some of them

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.450 
that for certain letters some of them
work<00:04:54.810> like<00:04:55.020> that<00:04:55.050> and<00:04:55.440> some<00:04:55.620> of<00:04:55.710> them<00:04:55.830> you<00:04:56.310> can

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
work like that and some of them you can

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.680 
work like that and some of them you can
just<00:04:57.090> kind<00:04:57.660> of<00:04:57.720> maybe<00:04:58.650> figure<00:04:58.979> it<00:04:59.039> out<00:04:59.539> so<00:05:00.539> with

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
just kind of maybe figure it out so with

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.040 
just kind of maybe figure it out so with
similar<00:05:01.130> methods<00:05:02.330> yeah<00:05:03.330> okay<00:05:03.690> i'll<00:05:03.810> show<00:05:03.990> you

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
similar methods yeah okay i'll show you

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.149 
similar methods yeah okay i'll show you
the<00:05:04.680> z<00:05:04.949> next<00:05:05.460> the<00:05:06.389> way<00:05:06.569> you<00:05:06.630> make<00:05:06.990> a<00:05:07.169> Z<00:05:07.500> or<00:05:07.830> an<00:05:07.949> S

00:05:08.149 --> 00:05:08.159 
the z next the way you make a Z or an S

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:11.149 
the z next the way you make a Z or an S
is<00:05:08.460> similar<00:05:09.150> to<00:05:09.270> the<00:05:09.389> way<00:05:09.479> you'd<00:05:09.659> make<00:05:09.840> a<00:05:09.870> J<00:05:10.169> but

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:11.159 
is similar to the way you'd make a J but

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:13.610 
is similar to the way you'd make a J but
i'll<00:05:11.639> just<00:05:11.880> do<00:05:12.000> it<00:05:12.090> to<00:05:12.509> give<00:05:13.349> you<00:05:13.470> another

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
i'll just do it to give you another

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.689 
i'll just do it to give you another
example<00:05:14.300> okay<00:05:15.300> so<00:05:15.630> for<00:05:16.409> the<00:05:16.500> z<00:05:16.770> i'll<00:05:17.190> switch

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 
example okay so for the z i'll switch

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:19.640 
example okay so for the z i'll switch
the<00:05:17.909> top<00:05:18.150> five<00:05:18.419> and<00:05:18.690> the<00:05:18.750> bottom<00:05:19.050> five<00:05:19.259> centers

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
the top five and the bottom five centers

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.260 
the top five and the bottom five centers
first<00:05:21.710> so<00:05:22.710> all<00:05:22.860> a<00:05:23.250> little<00:05:23.520> all<00:05:23.849> of<00:05:24.000> them<00:05:24.060> down

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
first so all a little all of them down

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.959 
first so all a little all of them down
and<00:05:24.690> those<00:05:24.930> left<00:05:25.520> these<00:05:26.520> left<00:05:26.819> and<00:05:27.720> back<00:05:27.870> out

00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:28.969 
and those left these left and back out

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:32.020 
and those left these left and back out
and<00:05:29.969> then<00:05:30.389> those<00:05:30.570> two<00:05:30.599> back<00:05:30.990> to<00:05:31.289> the<00:05:31.380> right

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.030 
and then those two back to the right

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:42.680 
and then those two back to the right
then<00:05:33.030> i'll<00:05:33.180> switch<00:05:33.530> the<00:05:34.530> middle<00:05:34.860> one<00:05:41.090> ok<00:05:42.090> so

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
then i'll switch the middle one ok so

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.879 
then i'll switch the middle one ok so
now<00:05:43.560> all<00:05:43.590> i<00:05:44.039> have<00:05:44.159> to<00:05:44.280> switch<00:05:44.580> is<00:05:45.030> this<00:05:45.389> one

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:45.889 
now all i have to switch is this one

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:49.219 
now all i have to switch is this one
this<00:05:46.889> top<00:05:47.310> right<00:05:47.669> in<00:05:47.969> the<00:05:48.509> three<00:05:48.870> by<00:05:49.020> three

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:49.229 
this top right in the three by three

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:53.180 
this top right in the three by three
block<00:05:49.469> this<00:05:50.460> one<00:05:50.729> and<00:05:50.940> this<00:05:51.570> one<00:05:51.740> to<00:05:52.740> connect

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
block this one and this one to connect

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.659 
block this one and this one to connect
to<00:05:53.940> make<00:05:54.090> the<00:05:54.509> line<00:05:55.159> diagonal<00:05:56.159> line<00:05:56.280> for<00:05:56.460> the<00:05:56.520> Z

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:56.669 
to make the line diagonal line for the Z

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:01.129 
to make the line diagonal line for the Z
so<00:05:57.539> if<00:05:58.169> I<00:05:58.380> did<00:05:58.530> if<00:05:58.770> I<00:05:58.919> switch<00:05:59.159> these<00:05:59.370> then<00:06:00.139> again

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:01.139 
so if I did if I switch these then again

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:03.670 
so if I did if I switch these then again
it<00:06:01.409> would<00:06:01.530> be<00:06:01.560> mirrored<00:06:02.190> on<00:06:02.340> on<00:06:02.639> this<00:06:02.909> side<00:06:03.120> so

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 
it would be mirrored on on this side so

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.330 
it would be mirrored on on this side so
if<00:06:04.680> I<00:06:05.180> so<00:06:06.180> it<00:06:06.330> would<00:06:06.479> switch<00:06:06.690> the<00:06:07.680> top<00:06:07.949> left<00:06:08.219> on

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 
if I so it would switch the top left on

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.420 
if I so it would switch the top left on
the<00:06:08.430> bottom<00:06:08.669> right<00:06:08.819> so<00:06:09.569> if<00:06:09.630> I<00:06:09.719> want<00:06:09.840> like<00:06:09.990> this

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430 
the bottom right so if I want like this

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.339 
the bottom right so if I want like this
then<00:06:11.430> if<00:06:12.060> it's<00:06:12.360> switch<00:06:12.599> to<00:06:12.719> the<00:06:12.810> top<00:06:12.990> left<00:06:13.229> in

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:13.349 
then if it's switch to the top left in

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:14.749 
then if it's switch to the top left in
the<00:06:13.409> bottom<00:06:13.680> right<00:06:13.860> that<00:06:14.159> would<00:06:14.250> work<00:06:14.400> because

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:14.759 
the bottom right that would work because

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:19.029 
the bottom right that would work because
then<00:06:14.969> I<00:06:15.030> can<00:06:15.090> turn<00:06:15.270> it<00:06:15.330> back<00:06:15.539> afterwards<00:06:16.159> so<00:06:17.159> um

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:19.039 
then I can turn it back afterwards so um

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:25.240 
then I can turn it back afterwards so um
so<00:06:20.039> what<00:06:20.490> I<00:06:20.550> want<00:06:20.699> to<00:06:20.729> do<00:06:20.909> is<00:06:22.130> turn<00:06:23.130> left

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.250 
so what I want to do is turn left

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.800 
so what I want to do is turn left
counterclockwise<00:06:26.250> and<00:06:26.850> the<00:06:27.600> back

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810 
counterclockwise and the back

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.500 
counterclockwise and the back
counterclockwise<00:06:28.620> and<00:06:29.280> the<00:06:30.120> bottom

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:30.510 
counterclockwise and the bottom

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:32.450 
counterclockwise and the bottom
counterclockwise<00:06:31.050> and<00:06:31.620> it<00:06:32.040> doesn't<00:06:32.430> matter

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 
counterclockwise and it doesn't matter

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.200 
counterclockwise and it doesn't matter
what<00:06:33.000> order<00:06:33.240> again<00:06:33.750> but<00:06:34.620> on<00:06:34.830> just<00:06:35.520> make<00:06:36.000> it<00:06:36.030> an

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210 
what order again but on just make it an

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.030 
what order again but on just make it an
order<00:06:36.360> that<00:06:36.600> you<00:06:36.660> can<00:06:36.840> remember<00:06:37.140> so<00:06:37.380> I<00:06:37.650> have<00:06:37.920> to

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:38.040 
order that you can remember so I have to

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.420 
order that you can remember so I have to
remember<00:06:38.220> bottom<00:06:39.210> back<00:06:39.630> and<00:06:39.930> then<00:06:40.050> left<00:06:40.430> after

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:41.430 
remember bottom back and then left after

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:42.970 
remember bottom back and then left after
I<00:06:41.460> do<00:06:41.640> the<00:06:41.790> sign<00:06:41.940> of<00:06:42.060> switch<00:06:42.240> sign<00:06:42.630> switching

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:42.980 
I do the sign of switch sign switching

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:52.910 
I do the sign of switch sign switching
so<00:06:43.980> I'll<00:06:44.610> just<00:06:44.640> switch<00:06:45.480> this<00:06:45.870> piece<00:06:51.800> then<00:06:52.800> I'll

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:52.920 
so I'll just switch this piece then I'll

00:06:52.920 --> 00:07:01.910 
so I'll just switch this piece then I'll
switch<00:06:53.250> this<00:06:54.180> piece<00:07:00.050> okay<00:07:01.050> so<00:07:01.350> I<00:07:01.380> have<00:07:01.500> the<00:07:01.650> Z

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:01.920 
switch this piece okay so I have the Z

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:07.850 
switch this piece okay so I have the Z
and<00:07:02.580> now<00:07:02.730> I<00:07:02.760> do<00:07:03.120> the<00:07:03.680> clockwise<00:07:05.390> clockwise<00:07:06.860> or

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:07.860 
and now I do the clockwise clockwise or

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:11.420 
and now I do the clockwise clockwise or
clockwise<00:07:08.570> so<00:07:09.570> these<00:07:09.810> sides<00:07:10.110> I<00:07:10.410> got<00:07:10.920> those<00:07:11.100> and

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:11.430 
clockwise so these sides I got those and

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:14.270 
clockwise so these sides I got those and
these<00:07:12.000> ones<00:07:12.240> aren't<00:07:12.630> married<00:07:13.140> so<00:07:14.100> these<00:07:14.220> are

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:14.280 
these ones aren't married so these are

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.440 
these ones aren't married so these are
good<00:07:14.930> so<00:07:15.930> yeah<00:07:16.650> that's<00:07:17.190> how<00:07:17.340> you<00:07:17.460> do<00:07:17.790> some

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:18.450 
good so yeah that's how you do some

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:22.760 
good so yeah that's how you do some
letters<00:07:19.550> that<00:07:20.550> aren't<00:07:20.880> symmetrical<00:07:21.030> and<00:07:21.770> you

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:22.770 
letters that aren't symmetrical and you

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.279 
letters that aren't symmetrical and you
can<00:07:22.890> just<00:07:23.070> experiment<00:07:23.400> with<00:07:23.610> that

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:25.289 
can just experiment with that

00:07:25.289 --> 00:07:29.959 
can just experiment with that
if<00:07:26.069> you<00:07:26.550> can<00:07:26.899> okay<00:07:27.899> um<00:07:28.169> you<00:07:29.159> know<00:07:29.279> down<00:07:29.699> left

00:07:29.959 --> 00:07:29.969 
if you can okay um you know down left

00:07:29.969 --> 00:07:32.389 
if you can okay um you know down left
upright<00:07:30.330> cycles<00:07:31.080> the<00:07:31.619> pieces<00:07:32.009> from<00:07:32.189> these

00:07:32.389 --> 00:07:32.399 
upright cycles the pieces from these

00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:34.549 
upright cycles the pieces from these
three<00:07:32.550> sides<00:07:32.849> if<00:07:33.479> you<00:07:33.659> did<00:07:33.869> a<00:07:34.169> different

00:07:34.549 --> 00:07:34.559 
three sides if you did a different

00:07:34.559 --> 00:07:37.639 
three sides if you did a different
algorithm<00:07:34.770> like<00:07:35.069> down<00:07:35.399> left<00:07:35.639> or<00:07:35.909> on<00:07:36.649> down

00:07:37.639 --> 00:07:37.649 
algorithm like down left or on down

00:07:37.649 --> 00:07:39.499 
algorithm like down left or on down
right<00:07:37.919> up<00:07:37.949> left<00:07:38.129> it<00:07:38.639> would<00:07:38.759> cycle<00:07:38.969> these<00:07:39.300> two

00:07:39.499 --> 00:07:39.509 
right up left it would cycle these two

00:07:39.509 --> 00:07:42.439 
right up left it would cycle these two
sides<00:07:39.749> um<00:07:40.619> or<00:07:41.369> if<00:07:41.580> you<00:07:41.669> started<00:07:41.999> with<00:07:42.180> like

00:07:42.439 --> 00:07:42.449 
sides um or if you started with like

00:07:42.449 --> 00:07:45.019 
sides um or if you started with like
moving<00:07:43.110> side<00:07:43.349> up<00:07:43.589> and<00:07:43.830> like<00:07:44.279> up<00:07:44.490> right<00:07:44.819> down

00:07:45.019 --> 00:07:45.029 
moving side up and like up right down

00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:46.730 
moving side up and like up right down
left<00:07:45.599> stuff<00:07:46.139> like<00:07:46.259> that<00:07:46.289> then<00:07:46.619> you<00:07:46.649> can

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:46.740 
left stuff like that then you can

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:50.450 
left stuff like that then you can
involve<00:07:47.009> the<00:07:47.449> bottom<00:07:48.449> side<00:07:48.629> too<00:07:48.899> so<00:07:49.770> if<00:07:50.279> you

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:50.460 
involve the bottom side too so if you

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:52.969 
involve the bottom side too so if you
can<00:07:50.639> figure<00:07:51.389> if<00:07:52.199> you<00:07:52.259> can<00:07:52.469> figure<00:07:52.619> out<00:07:52.740> how<00:07:52.919> to

00:07:52.969 --> 00:07:52.979 
can figure if you can figure out how to

00:07:52.979 --> 00:07:54.920 
can figure if you can figure out how to
involve<00:07:53.279> the<00:07:53.460> other<00:07:53.610> side's<00:07:53.879> and<00:07:54.240> make

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:54.930
