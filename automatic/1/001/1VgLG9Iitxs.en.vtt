example this no no I sewed an offer and
attack<00:00:41.219> from<00:00:41.399> this<00:00:41.670> place<00:00:43.070> it's<00:00:44.070> equal<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:45.450> he

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
attack from this place it's equal so he

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.840 
attack from this place it's equal so he
pleases<00:00:46.820> now<00:00:47.820> it's<00:00:48.149> still<00:00:48.530> game<00:00:49.530> not<00:00:50.399> finished

because yes yes yes but other

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.139 
because yes yes yes but other
possibility<00:00:58.289> would<00:00:58.440> have<00:00:58.620> been<00:01:01.730> yes<00:01:02.730> maybe

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
possibility would have been yes maybe

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.929 
possibility would have been yes maybe
but<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:04.019> know<00:01:04.049> for<00:01:04.530> example<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:07.939> you

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
but you know for example this so you

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
change yes yes I saw this at least

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:20.480 
change yes yes I saw this at least
what's<00:01:16.049> now<00:01:16.259> amenities<00:01:19.130> but<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.280> must

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
what's now amenities but you must

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.690 
what's now amenities but you must
calculate<00:01:23.720> and<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:25.979> must<00:01:26.310> give<00:01:26.460> peace

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
calculate and so so I must give peace

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.950 
calculate and so so I must give peace
you<00:01:27.689> take<00:01:28.009> then<00:01:29.009> he<00:01:29.250> doe<00:01:29.400> maybe<00:01:29.759> so<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.360> then

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
you take then he doe maybe so and then

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.069 
you take then he doe maybe so and then
and<00:01:31.890> then<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:33.979> maybe<00:01:34.979> he<00:01:35.280> changed<00:01:36.079> even

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
and then so so maybe he changed even

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.130 
and then so so maybe he changed even
maybe<00:01:37.500> he<00:01:37.799> may<00:01:38.159> be<00:01:38.220> nice<00:01:38.880> no<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.509> course<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.930> can

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
maybe he may be nice no of course I can

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.580 
maybe he may be nice no of course I can
lead<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.650> but<00:01:40.890> it's<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:42.030> want<00:01:42.210> more<00:01:43.170> clear

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
lead to but it's I want more clear

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:57.499 
lead to but it's I want more clear
I<00:01:54.409> worked<00:01:55.409> my<00:01:55.530> idea<00:01:56.040> just<00:01:56.130> attack<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.149> make

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
I worked my idea just attack and make

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.550 
I worked my idea just attack and make
them<00:01:57.750> free<00:01:58.049> very<00:01:58.290> important<00:01:58.829> place<00:01:59.579> yes

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
them free very important place yes

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.289 
them free very important place yes
so<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.590> want<00:02:02.070> now<00:02:02.250> attack<00:02:02.640> he<00:02:02.820> can<00:02:03.030> do<00:02:03.149> nothing

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
so I want now attack he can do nothing

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.530 
so I want now attack he can do nothing
because<00:02:03.750> if<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.170> change<00:02:05.000> then<00:02:06.000> when<00:02:06.180> my<00:02:06.299> dam

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
because if you change then when my dam

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.640 
because if you change then when my dam
is<00:02:06.689> free<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.229> attack<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.819> he<00:02:09.000> must<00:02:09.209> play<00:02:09.390> here

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.780 

thank<00:02:12.519> you<00:02:12.700> yes<00:02:13.569> I<00:02:13.780> think<00:02:13.989> it's<00:02:14.170> good<00:02:14.430> now<00:02:15.430> my

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
thank you yes I think it's good now my

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.559 
thank you yes I think it's good now my
idea<00:02:16.239> to<00:02:16.690> play<00:02:16.900> so<00:02:17.170> and<00:02:17.500> then<00:02:17.890> give<00:02:18.549> peace<00:02:18.819> and

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
idea to play so and then give peace and

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.979 
idea to play so and then give peace and
then<00:02:19.690> take<00:02:19.959> it<00:02:20.140> but<00:02:21.129> he<00:02:21.159> found<00:02:21.370> some<00:02:22.000> only<00:02:22.540> the

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
then take it but he found some only the

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:28.259 
then take it but he found some only the
little<00:02:23.799> little<00:02:25.049> little<00:02:26.049> trick<00:02:26.819> so<00:02:27.819> and<00:02:28.090> he

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
little little little trick so and he

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.080 
little little little trick so and he
places<00:02:28.569> its<00:02:29.129> position<00:02:30.129> is<00:02:30.340> not<00:02:30.519> so<00:02:30.700> good<00:02:30.879> move

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
places its position is not so good move

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.899 
places its position is not so good move
I<00:02:31.269> mean<00:02:31.450> for<00:02:31.720> what<00:02:32.319> was<00:02:32.470> even<00:02:32.890> not<00:02:33.069> trade

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:33.909 
I mean for what was even not trade

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:38.789 
I mean for what was even not trade
changing<00:02:34.720> them<00:02:34.930> but<00:02:35.200> after<00:02:35.620> this<00:02:36.150> so<00:02:37.799> and

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
changing them but after this so and

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.490 
changing them but after this so and
after<00:02:39.040> this<00:02:39.370> he<00:02:39.700> calculate<00:02:40.209> I<00:02:40.420> think<00:02:40.690> if<00:02:41.200> this

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
after this he calculate I think if this

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.220 
after this he calculate I think if this
and<00:02:41.739> so<00:02:41.950> it's<00:02:42.640> not<00:02:42.790> good<00:02:43.030> he's<00:02:43.390> winning<00:02:43.660> black

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
and so it's not good he's winning black

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:58.589 
and so it's not good he's winning black
wins<00:02:48.810> yes<00:02:49.810> ok<00:02:50.260> I<00:02:51.359> sold<00:02:52.359> is<00:02:52.569> this<00:02:52.780> but<00:02:56.760> now<00:02:57.760> like

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
wins yes ok I sold is this but now like

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.300 
wins yes ok I sold is this but now like
have<00:02:58.810> supposed<00:02:59.230> to<00:02:59.290> be<00:02:59.379> my<00:02:59.590> business<00:02:59.950> will

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
have supposed to be my business will

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.119 
have supposed to be my business will
better<00:03:00.579> but<00:03:01.510> then<00:03:01.920> 1520

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129 
better but then 1520

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:05.670 
better but then 1520
I<00:03:03.159> will<00:03:03.519> not<00:03:03.730> may<00:03:04.000> perhaps<00:03:04.480> I<00:03:04.870> don't<00:03:05.019> know<00:03:05.349> Oh

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
I will not may perhaps I don't know Oh

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.800 
I will not may perhaps I don't know Oh
this<00:03:06.040> combination<00:03:06.400> if<00:03:06.970> it<00:03:07.090> is<00:03:07.209> winning<00:03:07.659> out

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
this combination if it is winning out

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.990 
this combination if it is winning out
its<00:03:08.560> today<00:03:08.890> if<00:03:09.159> you<00:03:09.340> have<00:03:09.519> no<00:03:09.700> time<00:03:09.970> to

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
its today if you have no time to

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.670 
its today if you have no time to
calculate<00:03:10.359> it's<00:03:10.870> too<00:03:11.079> risky

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
calculate it's too risky

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.860 
calculate it's too risky
but<00:03:12.430> perhaps<00:03:14.310> it<00:03:15.310> survive<00:03:15.760> against<00:03:16.209> Africans

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
but perhaps it survive against Africans

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.470 
but perhaps it survive against Africans
no<00:03:17.230> I<00:03:17.260> don't<00:03:17.709> like<00:03:17.919> because<00:03:18.160> I<00:03:18.459> think<00:03:18.489> if<00:03:19.269> you

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
no I don't like because I think if you

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.569 
no I don't like because I think if you
don't<00:03:19.630> have<00:03:19.870> time<00:03:20.079> to<00:03:20.139> calculate<00:03:20.500> you<00:03:21.040> yes

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
don't have time to calculate you yes

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:25.020 
don't have time to calculate you yes
it's<00:03:22.030> it<00:03:22.480> would<00:03:22.660> be<00:03:22.810> insane<00:03:23.290> to<00:03:23.500> do<00:03:23.620> so<00:03:23.859> yes<00:03:24.700> but

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
it's it would be insane to do so yes but

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.770 
it's it would be insane to do so yes but
I<00:03:25.060> told<00:03:25.530> but<00:03:26.530> not<00:03:26.859> because<00:03:27.190> no<00:03:27.579> because<00:03:28.329> it's<00:03:28.540> I

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
I told but not because no because it's I

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.129 
I told but not because no because it's I
see<00:03:29.019> some<00:03:29.230> possibility<00:03:29.859> for<00:03:30.040> winning<00:03:31.139> yes

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
see some possibility for winning yes

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:35.129 
see some possibility for winning yes
nice<00:03:32.440> and<00:03:32.470> take<00:03:32.980> but<00:03:33.879> five<00:03:34.120> against<00:03:34.480> three<00:03:34.569> in

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:35.139 
nice and take but five against three in

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:39.439 
nice and take but five against three in
then<00:03:35.410> this<00:03:36.069> flank<00:03:37.379> maybe<00:03:38.379> but<00:03:38.680> maybe<00:03:38.859> we<00:03:39.220> need

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:39.449 
then this flank maybe but maybe we need

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:43.439 
then this flank maybe but maybe we need
but<00:03:40.449> not<00:03:40.629> necessary<00:03:41.139> so<00:03:41.470> yes<00:03:41.980> I<00:03:42.310> don't<00:03:42.699> know<00:03:42.819> is

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:43.449 
but not necessary so yes I don't know is

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:47.220 
but not necessary so yes I don't know is
the<00:03:43.660> best<00:03:43.900> because<00:03:45.239> yes<00:03:46.239> this<00:03:46.629> is<00:03:46.810> not<00:03:47.019> good

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
the best because yes this is not good

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.080 
the best because yes this is not good
because<00:03:47.379> see<00:03:47.859> here<00:03:50.459> stupid<00:03:51.489> yeah<00:03:51.609> maybe<00:03:51.910> is

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
because see here stupid yeah maybe is

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.509 
because see here stupid yeah maybe is
also<00:03:52.419> being<00:03:52.629> but<00:03:52.959> it<00:03:53.169> still<00:03:54.720> maybe<00:03:55.720> maybe<00:03:56.109> this

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
also being but it still maybe maybe this

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.330 
also being but it still maybe maybe this
maybe<00:03:57.519> this<00:03:57.849> but<00:03:58.150> I<00:03:58.449> don't<00:03:58.510> know<00:03:58.780> but<00:03:59.139> then

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
maybe this but I don't know but then

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:05.360 
maybe this but I don't know but then
again<00:04:00.480> 1520<00:04:01.480> I<00:04:01.690> know<00:04:02.230> this<00:04:02.500> maybe<00:04:02.940> maybe<00:04:03.940> again

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
again 1520 I know this maybe maybe again

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.210 
again 1520 I know this maybe maybe again
no<00:04:06.750> that<00:04:07.750> I<00:04:07.870> don't<00:04:08.079> know<00:04:08.199> why<00:04:08.410> because<00:04:08.709> it's

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
no that I don't know why because it's

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.580 
no that I don't know why because it's
not<00:04:09.250> possible<00:04:09.549> this<00:04:10.000> I<00:04:10.530> saw<00:04:11.530> something<00:04:11.980> but

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
not possible this I saw something but

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.349 
not possible this I saw something but
maybe<00:04:14.590> maybe<00:04:14.980> this<00:04:15.250> was<00:04:15.459> better<00:04:15.670> but<00:04:16.180> I<00:04:16.329> can't

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
maybe maybe this was better but I can't

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.349 
maybe maybe this was better but I can't
put<00:04:16.720> it<00:04:16.810> something<00:04:17.170> else<00:04:17.820> the<00:04:18.820> college<00:04:19.150> this

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
put it something else the college this

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.190 
put it something else the college this
yes<00:04:19.840> it's<00:04:20.109> the<00:04:20.260> best<00:04:20.940> it<00:04:21.940> was<00:04:22.150> all<00:04:22.360> it's<00:04:22.930> also

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
yes it's the best it was all it's also

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.060 
yes it's the best it was all it's also
the<00:04:23.500> best<00:04:23.850> now<00:04:24.850> well<00:04:25.270> if<00:04:25.600> I<00:04:26.080> have<00:04:26.290> samples<00:04:26.830> a

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
the best now well if I have samples a

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.760 
the best now well if I have samples a
few<00:04:27.400> possibility<00:04:28.030> to<00:04:28.150> win<00:04:28.300> a<00:04:28.360> piece<00:04:28.660> I<00:04:28.930> can<00:04:29.590> do

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
few possibility to win a piece I can do

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:30.240 
few possibility to win a piece I can do
this

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
this

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.990 
this
but<00:04:30.610> then<00:04:30.790> he<00:04:30.970> plays<00:04:31.210> so<00:04:31.480> and<00:04:31.720> by<00:04:31.900> tempo<00:04:32.820> not<00:04:33.820> so

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
but then he plays so and by tempo not so

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.600 
but then he plays so and by tempo not so
easy<00:04:34.240> meanwhile<00:04:34.720> I<00:04:34.900> think<00:04:35.230> not<00:04:35.470> so<00:04:35.650> easy<00:04:35.860> so<00:04:36.580> I

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
easy meanwhile I think not so easy so I

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.080 
easy meanwhile I think not so easy so I
decide<00:04:37.180> to<00:04:37.450> do<00:04:38.020> this<00:04:38.290> and<00:04:39.010> now<00:04:39.550> it's<00:04:39.790> trade

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
decide to do this and now it's trade

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:48.060 
decide to do this and now it's trade
this<00:04:40.300> all<00:04:40.540> I<00:04:40.570> must<00:04:40.810> do<00:04:41.020> something<00:04:46.740> we<00:04:47.740> cannot

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
this all I must do something we cannot

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:57.060 
this all I must do something we cannot
change<00:04:48.900> much<00:04:49.900> and<00:04:50.400> he<00:04:51.400> is<00:04:51.430> still<00:04:55.380> still<00:04:56.380> some<00:04:56.620> I

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
change much and he is still still some I

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:02.610 
change much and he is still still some I
have<00:04:57.340> a<00:04:57.370> choice<00:04:57.700> because<00:04:58.800> for<00:04:59.800> example<00:05:01.620> first

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
have a choice because for example first

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.860 
have a choice because for example first
I<00:05:02.770> want<00:05:02.980> to<00:05:03.040> play<00:05:03.280> this<00:05:03.520> but<00:05:04.180> then<00:05:04.360> I<00:05:04.479> see<00:05:04.660> he

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
I want to play this but then I see he

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.920 
I want to play this but then I see he
just<00:05:04.900> play<00:05:05.400> and<00:05:06.400> I<00:05:06.610> cannot<00:05:06.910> change<00:05:07.210> because<00:05:07.750> if

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
just play and I cannot change because if

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:14.510 
just play and I cannot change because if
you<00:05:08.200> change<00:05:08.530> it<00:05:08.830> and<00:05:10.229> then<00:05:11.310> if<00:05:12.310> if<00:05:12.790> so<00:05:13.150> and<00:05:13.510> so

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
you change it and then if if so and so

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.040 
you change it and then if if so and so
that's<00:05:15.520> one<00:05:15.760> piece<00:05:15.970> more<00:05:16.270> but<00:05:16.540> I<00:05:16.570> think<00:05:16.690> it's

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
that's one piece more but I think it's

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:28.830 
that's one piece more but I think it's
no<00:05:17.140> problem<00:05:17.410> yes<00:05:17.860> big<00:05:18.490> Frank<00:05:18.790> so<00:05:19.540> I<00:05:19.570> think<00:05:27.840> yes

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
no problem yes big Frank so I think yes

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.000 
no problem yes big Frank so I think yes
and<00:05:28.870> now<00:05:29.289> it's<00:05:30.600> yes<00:05:31.600> he<00:05:31.960> play<00:05:32.169> a<00:05:32.200> three<00:05:32.770> three

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
and now it's yes he play a three three

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.909 
and now it's yes he play a three three
three<00:05:33.160> three<00:05:33.520> nine<00:05:33.970> eleven<00:05:34.630> yes<00:05:34.870> I<00:05:35.200> think<00:05:35.530> I

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 
three three nine eleven yes I think I

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:39.029 
three three nine eleven yes I think I
decided<00:05:36.789> to<00:05:36.970> must<00:05:37.840> be<00:05:38.080> quickly<00:05:38.320> take<00:05:38.620> point<00:05:38.890> I

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:39.039 
decided to must be quickly take point I

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:42.900 
decided to must be quickly take point I
want<00:05:39.250> to<00:05:39.280> take<00:05:39.550> this<00:05:40.020> so<00:05:41.020> probably<00:05:41.680> this<00:05:42.610> must

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
want to take this so probably this must

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.750 
want to take this so probably this must
be<00:05:43.060> winnin<00:05:43.390> because<00:05:44.010> and<00:05:45.010> after<00:05:45.370> this<00:05:45.550> I<00:05:45.729> think

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
be winnin because and after this I think

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.240 
be winnin because and after this I think
this<00:05:46.060> very<00:05:46.300> good<00:05:46.510> move<00:05:46.720> because<00:05:47.470> I<00:05:47.950> want<00:05:48.160> to

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
this very good move because I want to

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.880 
this very good move because I want to
change<00:05:48.550> and<00:05:49.390> after<00:05:49.720> this<00:05:49.900> I<00:05:50.110> just<00:05:50.380> easy<00:05:50.590> take

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:50.890 
change and after this I just easy take

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:53.340 
change and after this I just easy take
second<00:05:51.250> piece<00:05:51.490> I<00:05:51.669> think<00:05:51.820> it<00:05:52.150> must<00:05:52.810> be<00:05:52.960> Binion

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:53.350 
second piece I think it must be Binion

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.580 
second piece I think it must be Binion
he<00:05:53.560> is<00:05:53.620> not<00:05:53.770> in<00:05:53.919> time<00:05:54.130> or<00:05:54.370> not<00:05:54.400> flying<00:05:55.590> so

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590 
he is not in time or not flying so

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:05.749 
he is not in time or not flying so
people<00:05:56.979> I<00:05:57.070> think<00:05:57.100> so<00:05:59.430> yes<00:06:01.710> then<00:06:02.710> I<00:06:02.860> change

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:09.600 

and<00:06:06.759> he<00:06:06.940> plays<00:06:07.180> and<00:06:07.750> I<00:06:07.840> thought<00:06:08.050> so<00:06:08.319> yes<00:06:09.310> and

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
and he plays and I thought so yes and

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.659 
and he plays and I thought so yes and
this<00:06:09.789> is<00:06:09.970> not<00:06:10.930> so<00:06:11.080> difficult<00:06:11.110> to<00:06:11.650> be<00:06:11.740> like<00:06:12.639> a

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:12.669 
this is not so difficult to be like a

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:15.659 
this is not so difficult to be like a
position<00:06:13.270> but<00:06:13.419> I<00:06:13.449> have<00:06:13.720> one<00:06:13.870> piece<00:06:14.050> more<00:06:14.669> so

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:15.669 
position but I have one piece more so
