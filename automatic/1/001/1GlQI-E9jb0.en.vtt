00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.580
 different 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:17.080
 I said is the power and the setup and 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.230
 let's start to see I'm here today that 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:26.570
 It looks like a small 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:26.570
 the case serve had had code 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.430
 with this so that you can stand with the 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.740
 support this 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.740
 and nothing is the micro here we have the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:44.100
 the super keyboard that also has marc 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.820
 keyboard gamer with only half keyboard 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.610
 the other keyboard 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:52.680
 I have two helmets that I also had 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:57.680
 100% highly recommended brand 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.680
 also radon 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.110
 and the superstar is giant in the 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.460
 bed 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.670
 as it has already been found said marc 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.680
 we wanted to pair more or less that I have 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.680
 it's nonsense I do not have 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.570
 once 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.000
 4 which 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.100
 would be 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.950
 here I have to present to the chair that 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:32.200
 I have to if I do not get tired of Paris and 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.200
 it suffocates well here I have 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:40.730
 the TV and the nice big monitor of the 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:44.600
 make full hd sorry 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:46.730
 of luxury very well contrast and here I have 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.000
 an old monitor but we are part of 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:52.010
 secondary school is going pretty well 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.750
 the roll of this two screens I like 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.580
 much 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:00.290
 and here I have 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.290
 it will look good attention to light 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.360
 here you see the mouth 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:11.929
 normal and current in the second 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.990
 on the internet that is falling 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.960
 but I have here to hear a 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:26.040
 perfect crime and there are all of cables and 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.040
 nothing this is my tower 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.170
 as now now I come back and I teach you a 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.850
 little the tower inside because we're going to 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.850
 see this cloth now comrades 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.080
 well this is my 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:45.630
 my tower lying on the ground must 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.630
 start here you have the graph is a 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:52.510
 we will fire about 7,950 d md 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.680
 what I've been using it for is 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.680
 quite enjoying its performance 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:05.599
 and I have the processor I have an amd fx 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:09.290
 6,300 with this team is also going 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:11.090
 very very well really necessary a 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.540
 liquid cooling for what I 'm going to 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.330
 do to the processor as it goes for the moment 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.190
 I do not get too hot and you have and 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.819
 I'm leaving these cables, you have the ram here 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.819
 dissipated 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.500
 anticipated 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.150
 with 8 gigs to 1600 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.100
 here you have the hard drive of a terror 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.890
 medium 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.260
 here 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.730
 an ssd 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:46.350
 then 120 gb I think 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.350
 the base is a rock 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.330
 as rock 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.670
 but 700 watt power supply 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:57.250
 thermaltake 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.840
 and it is already I think I do not neglect anything more 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.950
 a little the top view of what 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.600
 is 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.820
 for example this here is 20 mi 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:10.290
 father who is refrigerated now more than 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:12.560
 unused moment and nothing to see anything else 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:17.060
 we wanted to comment 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:19.250
 is that everything feels here is worth another 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.079
 What I wanted to tell you is that today 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.410
 it has left trailer of battlefield 4 and 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:26.419
 good and a gameplay of enough minutes 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.210
