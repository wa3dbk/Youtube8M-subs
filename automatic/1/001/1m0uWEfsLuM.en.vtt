a 2 5 o RG and a 0 v 8 differential
those<00:00:39.149> are<00:00:39.329> fairly<00:00:39.570> high<00:00:39.840> numbers<00:00:40.489> typically

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
those are fairly high numbers typically

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.799 
those are fairly high numbers typically
the<00:00:41.730> higher<00:00:41.910> ones<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.420> tend<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.719> use

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
the higher ones that I tend to use

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.979 
the higher ones that I tend to use
during<00:00:43.350> any<00:00:43.500> block<00:00:43.910> now<00:00:44.910> how<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.180> use<00:00:45.570> these<00:00:45.750> 2

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
during any block now how I use these 2

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.380 
during any block now how I use these 2
balls<00:00:46.260> are<00:00:47.160> pretty<00:00:47.370> straightforward

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
balls are pretty straightforward

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.720 
balls are pretty straightforward

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
the black widow assassin doesn't

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.310 
the black widow assassin doesn't
struggle<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.210> get<00:00:51.629> through<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.989> fronts

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
struggle to get through the fronts

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.529 
struggle to get through the fronts
anytime<00:00:52.710> there's<00:00:52.890> any<00:00:53.070> kind<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.489> burn<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.940> the

anytime there's any kind of burn and the

Black Widow a legend has a stronger

midlane breed and still has a continuous
motion<00:00:59.190> downline<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.289> typically<00:01:01.289> like<00:01:01.500> to

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
motion downline so typically like to

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.020 
motion downline so typically like to
take<00:01:01.800> out<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.070> black<00:01:02.280> widow<00:01:02.489> legend<00:01:02.940> out

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
take out the black widow legend out

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.149 
take out the black widow legend out
first<00:01:03.329> maybe<00:01:03.600> like<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.870> game<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.350> give<00:01:04.680> 3<00:01:05.010> in<00:01:05.100> the

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
first maybe like a game to give 3 in the

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.590 
first maybe like a game to give 3 in the
block<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.580> go<00:01:05.729> ahead<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.030> try<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.210> finish<00:01:06.450> it

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
block and go ahead and try to finish it

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.289 
block and go ahead and try to finish it
off<00:01:06.869> or<00:01:07.470> get<00:01:07.740> as<00:01:07.860> far<00:01:08.100> as<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.369> can<00:01:08.430> with<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.909> legend

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
off or get as far as I can with a legend

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.270 
off or get as far as I can with a legend
before<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.600> need<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.930> throw<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.290> assassin<00:01:10.830> the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
before I need to throw the assassin the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.070 
before I need to throw the assassin the
legend<00:01:11.640> because<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.330> does<00:01:12.510> have<00:01:12.689> an<00:01:12.840> earlier

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
legend because it does have an earlier

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.990 
legend because it does have an earlier
mid<00:01:13.260> lane<00:01:13.409> read<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:14.189> me<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.430> just<00:01:14.460> makes<00:01:14.880> a

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
mid lane read to me it just makes a

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.490 
mid lane read to me it just makes a
little<00:01:15.090> more<00:01:15.299> sense<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.689> throw<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:16.110> also

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
little more sense to throw this also

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.890 
little more sense to throw this also
with<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.130> continuous<00:01:17.640> back<00:01:17.820> in<00:01:18.030> motion<00:01:18.210> it

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
with the continuous back in motion it

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.030 
with the continuous back in motion it
tends<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.290> help<00:01:19.500> me<00:01:19.650> out

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
tends to help me out

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.160 
tends to help me out
use<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.460> as<00:01:20.670> lanes<00:01:21.180> are<00:01:21.330> transitioning<00:01:21.990> and

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
use it as lanes are transitioning and

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.749 
use it as lanes are transitioning and
I'm<00:01:22.560> needing<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.890> little<00:01:23.100> more<00:01:23.220> motion<00:01:23.400> down

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
I'm needing a little more motion down

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:24.260 
I'm needing a little more motion down

now<00:01:24.780> when<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.080> fronts<00:01:25.380> kind<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.680> tend<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.890> be<00:01:26.040> a

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
now when the fronts kind of tend to be a

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.190 
now when the fronts kind of tend to be a
little<00:01:26.310> bit<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.700> struggle<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.689> get<00:01:27.930> through

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
little bit of a struggle to get through

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.780 
little bit of a struggle to get through
I'll<00:01:28.560> go<00:01:28.829> ahead<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.189> pull<00:01:29.310> out<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.460> black

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
I'll go ahead and pull out the black

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.429 
I'll go ahead and pull out the black
widow<00:01:30.030> assassin<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.750> gives<00:01:30.930> me<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.110> little<00:01:31.290> bit

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
widow assassin it gives me a little bit

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.499 
widow assassin it gives me a little bit
more<00:01:31.619> money<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.640> still<00:01:32.880> have<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.090> back

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
more money and you still have that back

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.660 
more money and you still have that back
in<00:01:33.750> motion<00:01:34.320> and

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
in motion and

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.190 
in motion and
most<00:01:34.850> of<00:01:35.000> to<00:01:35.119> depends<00:01:35.479> because<00:01:35.630> with<00:01:35.900> the<00:01:35.990> same

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
most of to depends because with the same

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.929 
most of to depends because with the same
rate<00:01:36.409> clock<00:01:36.680> they<00:01:37.189> complement<00:01:37.670> each<00:01:37.729> other

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.060 
rate clock they complement each other
very<00:01:38.030> well<00:01:38.330> I'll<00:01:38.960> go<00:01:39.200> ahead<00:01:39.350> and<00:01:39.560> show<00:01:39.710> up<00:01:39.890> and

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
very well I'll go ahead and show up and

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.909 
very well I'll go ahead and show up and
let<00:01:40.189> you<00:01:40.310> see<00:01:40.460> how<00:01:40.490> they<00:01:40.729> roll
