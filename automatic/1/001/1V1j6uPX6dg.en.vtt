00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:16.390

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.670 
lets play and I think that's coming up
to<00:00:16.510> like<00:00:16.630> three<00:00:16.870> weeks<00:00:17.020> or<00:00:17.260> something<00:00:17.410> now

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:17.680 
to like three weeks or something now

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.370 
to like three weeks or something now
it's<00:00:17.860> getting<00:00:18.010> pretty<00:00:18.160> long<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.990> reason<00:00:20.350> for

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:20.380 
it's getting pretty long the reason for

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.650 
it's getting pretty long the reason for
that<00:00:20.620> is<00:00:20.800> every<00:00:21.430> time<00:00:21.610> I<00:00:21.640> go<00:00:21.850> and<00:00:21.970> record<00:00:22.390> an

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 
that is every time I go and record an

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.890 
that is every time I go and record an
episode<00:00:22.780> I<00:00:23.410> just<00:00:23.710> not<00:00:24.580> really<00:00:24.880> feeling<00:00:24.910> it<00:00:25.420> I
