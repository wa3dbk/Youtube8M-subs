hi<00:00:10.030> are<00:00:11.030> they<00:00:11.180> talking<00:00:11.450> about<00:00:11.480> your<00:00:11.809> plane<00:00:12.049> now

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:13.690 
hi are they talking about your plane now

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:20.560 
hi are they talking about your plane now
that<00:00:14.690> one

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.620 

so<00:00:21.109> that<00:00:21.259> has<00:00:21.380> an<00:00:21.499> altimeter<00:00:21.919> built-in<00:00:22.220> -<00:00:22.669> yeah

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
so that has an altimeter built-in - yeah

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.849 
so that has an altimeter built-in - yeah
this<00:00:23.960> little<00:00:24.289> feature<00:00:24.800> here<00:00:26.320> cuts<00:00:27.320> it<00:00:27.500> off<00:00:27.619> you

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:27.859 
this little feature here cuts it off you

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.509 
this little feature here cuts it off you
can<00:00:28.039> set<00:00:28.279> it<00:00:28.399> for<00:00:28.609> either<00:00:29.349> 150<00:00:30.349> 100<00:00:31.219> hundred

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:31.519 
can set it for either 150 100 hundred

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:35.560 
can set it for either 150 100 hundred
and<00:00:31.609> 50<00:00:31.880> or<00:00:32.000> 200<00:00:32.210> meters<00:00:32.599> of<00:00:33.019> altitude<00:00:34.089> and<00:00:35.089> the

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
and 50 or 200 meters of altitude and the

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.649 
and 50 or 200 meters of altitude and the
automatic<00:00:35.899> shuts<00:00:36.320> down<00:00:36.500> at<00:00:36.710> 30<00:00:36.920> seconds<00:00:37.659> so

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:38.659 
automatic shuts down at 30 seconds so

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:40.899 
automatic shuts down at 30 seconds so
it's<00:00:38.809> -<00:00:39.050> if<00:00:40.040> you<00:00:40.190> have<00:00:40.339> a<00:00:40.370> number<00:00:40.640> of<00:00:40.760> them

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:40.909 
it's - if you have a number of them

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:44.020 
it's - if you have a number of them
equipped<00:00:41.390> it<00:00:41.989> sets<00:00:42.739> everybody<00:00:43.430> in<00:00:43.699> the<00:00:43.790> same

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
equipped it sets everybody in the same

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.660 
equipped it sets everybody in the same
plane<00:00:44.589> you<00:00:45.589> know<00:00:45.620> so<00:00:45.890> you<00:00:45.949> can<00:00:46.159> they<00:00:46.430> can't

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
plane you know so you can they can't

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.910 
plane you know so you can they can't
climb<00:00:46.879> a<00:00:46.940> higher<00:00:47.269> than<00:00:47.570> 200<00:00:48.379> meters<00:00:48.680> under

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
climb a higher than 200 meters under

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.490 
climb a higher than 200 meters under
power<00:00:49.129> okay

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
power okay

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.990 
power okay
and<00:00:51.500> you<00:00:51.649> have<00:00:51.769> folding<00:00:52.129> props<00:00:52.430> on<00:00:52.670> this<00:00:52.820> thing

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
and you have folding props on this thing

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.840 
and you have folding props on this thing
oh<00:00:53.239> yeah<00:00:53.780> so<00:00:54.739> did<00:00:54.860> you<00:00:54.920> swing<00:00:55.220> right<00:00:55.430> in<00:00:55.610> and

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
oh yeah so did you swing right in and

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.100 
oh yeah so did you swing right in and
they<00:00:56.000> swing<00:00:56.269> right<00:00:56.449> in<00:00:56.600> as<00:00:56.750> soon<00:00:56.869> as<00:00:56.989> they

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
they swing right in as soon as they

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.979 
they swing right in as soon as they
start<00:00:57.379> to<00:00:57.409> glide<00:00:57.710> yeah<00:00:58.159> and<00:00:58.489> then<00:00:58.640> when<00:00:59.089> you

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
start to glide yeah and then when you

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:01.899 
start to glide yeah and then when you
run<00:01:00.170> the<00:01:00.290> motor<00:01:00.470> the<00:01:01.040> trigger<00:01:01.460> will<00:01:01.670> force

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:01.909 
run the motor the trigger will force

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:09.310 
run the motor the trigger will force
just<00:01:02.180> holds<00:01:02.420> the<00:01:02.509> moat<00:01:07.659> just<00:01:08.659> a<00:01:08.750> fairly<00:01:09.110> new

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
just holds the moat just a fairly new

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.830 
just holds the moat just a fairly new
thing<00:01:09.350> then<00:01:09.890> or<00:01:10.130> yeah<00:01:10.759> this<00:01:11.060> really<00:01:11.659> got

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
thing then or yeah this really got

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.780 
thing then or yeah this really got
started<00:01:12.350> in<00:01:12.590> Europe<00:01:13.040> and<00:01:13.220> then<00:01:13.340> it<00:01:13.460> came<00:01:13.610> to

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
started in Europe and then it came to

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.590 
started in Europe and then it came to
North<00:01:13.970> America<00:01:14.420> last<00:01:14.659> fall<00:01:14.960> and<00:01:16.210> it's<00:01:17.210> sort<00:01:17.509> of

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
North America last fall and it's sort of

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.249 
North America last fall and it's sort of
the<00:01:18.430> one<00:01:19.430> of<00:01:19.579> the<00:01:19.700> new<00:01:20.149> features<00:01:20.659> of<00:01:20.689> glider

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
the one of the new features of glider

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.980 
the one of the new features of glider
flying<00:01:21.619> and<00:01:21.920> seems<00:01:22.880> to<00:01:22.970> be<00:01:23.090> going<00:01:23.329> over<00:01:23.479> quite

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
flying and seems to be going over quite

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.469 
flying and seems to be going over quite
strongly<00:01:24.380> because<00:01:25.360> particularly<00:01:26.360> with

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
strongly because particularly with

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.600 
strongly because particularly with
electric<00:01:26.900> gliders<00:01:27.320> I<00:01:27.500> mean<00:01:27.680> it<00:01:27.830> if<00:01:28.280> you<00:01:28.400> put

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
electric gliders I mean it if you put

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.030 
electric gliders I mean it if you put
along<00:01:28.909> a<00:01:29.330> large<00:01:29.810> battery<00:01:30.110> and<00:01:30.409> you<00:01:30.500> can<00:01:30.530> keep

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
along a large battery and you can keep

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.830 
along a large battery and you can keep
the<00:01:31.190> motor<00:01:31.400> running<00:01:31.520> for<00:01:32.090> a<00:01:32.120> long<00:01:32.300> time<00:01:32.600> and

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
the motor running for a long time and

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.810 
the motor running for a long time and
stay<00:01:32.990> up<00:01:33.140> where<00:01:33.710> is<00:01:33.830> this<00:01:33.950> limits<00:01:34.340> you<00:01:34.460> to<00:01:34.490> 30

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
stay up where is this limits you to 30

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.969 
stay up where is this limits you to 30
seconds<00:01:35.360> maximum<00:01:35.840> or<00:01:36.200> 200<00:01:36.560> meters<00:01:36.680> of

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
seconds maximum or 200 meters of

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.690 
seconds maximum or 200 meters of
altitude<00:01:37.100> so<00:01:38.090> it's<00:01:38.299> it's<00:01:38.600> it<00:01:39.400> puts<00:01:40.400> everybody

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
altitude so it's it's it puts everybody

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.980 
altitude so it's it's it puts everybody
on<00:01:41.180> the<00:01:42.049> same<00:01:42.229> playing<00:01:42.560> field<00:01:42.700> you<00:01:43.700> know<00:01:43.990> your

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
on the same playing field you know your

00:01:44.990 --> 00:02:05.160 
on the same playing field you know your
name<00:01:45.170> is<00:01:45.320> rod<00:01:45.590> yeah<00:01:46.100> and<00:01:46.340> you're<00:01:46.790> with

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.810 

for<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:06.260> 30<00:02:06.500> seconds<00:02:06.950> there<00:02:07.160> we<00:02:07.280> are<00:02:07.310> so<00:02:07.670> it's

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
for the 30 seconds there we are so it's

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.890 
for the 30 seconds there we are so it's
limited<00:02:08.479> motor<00:02:08.660> run<00:02:08.990> and<00:02:09.550> elevation<00:02:10.550> and<00:02:11.540> or

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
limited motor run and elevation and or

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.730 
limited motor run and elevation and or
key<00:02:12.260> there<00:02:12.470> we<00:02:12.560> are

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
key there we are

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
for ten minutes oh yeah and then here's

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.540 
for ten minutes oh yeah and then here's
the<00:02:22.069> point<00:02:22.340> for<00:02:22.670> every<00:02:22.970> yes<00:02:23.890> but<00:02:24.890> no<00:02:25.190> you're

the point for every yes but no you're
here<00:02:25.760> aiming<00:02:26.060> at<00:02:26.209> ten<00:02:26.420> minutes<00:02:26.810> and<00:02:26.959> you're

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
here aiming at ten minutes and you're

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.230 
here aiming at ten minutes and you're
aiming<00:02:27.440> to<00:02:27.620> land<00:02:27.650> on<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.490> spot<00:02:28.819> on<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.060> ground

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
aiming to land on the spot on the ground

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.570 
aiming to land on the spot on the ground
exactly<00:02:29.810> in<00:02:30.020> that<00:02:30.170> spot<00:02:30.650> you've<00:02:30.920> got<00:02:31.130> a<00:02:31.160> 50

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
exactly in that spot you've got a 50

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.720 
exactly in that spot you've got a 50
meter<00:02:31.910> radius<00:02:32.840> team<00:02:33.170> yes<00:02:33.680> 5<00:02:34.070> meter<00:02:34.370> 10<00:02:34.700> meter

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
meter radius team yes 5 meter 10 meter

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.290 
meter radius team yes 5 meter 10 meter
yeah<00:02:35.450> so<00:02:35.900> you<00:02:36.410> if<00:02:37.310> you<00:02:37.490> hit<00:02:37.640> the<00:02:37.790> spot<00:02:38.000> you<00:02:38.060> get

have<00:02:43.820> left<00:02:44.090> on<00:02:44.239> your<00:02:44.360> clock<00:02:44.600> it<00:02:44.750> doesn't<00:02:45.080> 32

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
have left on your clock it doesn't 32
