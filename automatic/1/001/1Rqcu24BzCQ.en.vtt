 many practice in it 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.160
 Climbing plants are supposed to grow every year 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.640
 get cut 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.770
 the kind lonicera japan japanese 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.500
 honeysuckle flowers for example especially 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:36.600
 rich in new gears cut strongly 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.520
 blooms rich in the summer the pleasant 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.440
 smell and be soldered from below 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.730
 settled 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.149
 plants that are not cut 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.149
 only flowers are not rich anymore 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.280
 and are less impressive the 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.160
 lucerne japan luca here the variety 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.890
 thaliana is a semi evergreen 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.879
 plant here are the leaves in part 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.219
 flown back 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.649
 the temperature was up in winter 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.650
 minus 22 degrees celsius 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.010
 at minus 15 degrees Celsius for more 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.470
 leaves spared 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:13.260
 the ungloss leaves also include the 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.620
 lonicera aminata pointed hedges 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.620
 church 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.080
 No 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.200
 and the linzer henry evergreen spirit 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.869
 sling these two bushes need 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.940
 not be cut severely 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.600
 We enjoy their leaves as far as the 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.780
 Both have mind-leaves overwintered 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.520
 cope with 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.220
 but also good the cut 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.590
 especially the pointed hedges 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.110
 cherry she will despite a strong 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.500
 but we remain prosperous 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.570
 first at the Japanese honeysuckle that 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.210
 is a very valuable plant 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.720
 However, it can only be used in regions 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.700
 mild climate can be used 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.429
 it is lower for eastern europe 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.170
 Frost hard little suitable because they are in 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:03.330
 Stricter winter and reset 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.830
 can 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.690
 Nevertheless , we should in our garden 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.330
 not on the japanese honeysuckle 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.780
 Dispense because this plant is practical 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.269
 scarcely affected by aphids is the 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.060
 beatrice in the summer the pleasant 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:23.069
 fragrant flowers are first cream and 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.069
 are bleeding during the 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:33.800
 this climber grows strong 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.040
 her shoots reach a length in the year 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.750
 of up to three meters 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.200
 It can be used as a privacy screen 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.210
 Should be low frost hardness 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.380
 They are best protected and chosen 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.380
 be planted 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.870
 she is at a height of 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.750
 about 50 to 60 cm above the ground 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.430
 enter cut back 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.150
 These shoots are in the last year 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.090
 grown 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.430
 they all have to be removed with it 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:08.510
 In the summer we have a wall of beautiful 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:11.000
 enjoy fragrant flowers as 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:14.060
 support here is a grid of thin 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.020
 galvanized wire denies this grid 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.750
 lasts up to twelve to fifteen years and is 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:24.550
 while enough fine that the shoots 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.550
 of the circle can act on it 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.730
 When planting we have to cut very much 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.540
 Watch out for that is not about 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.030
 to damage 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.660
 Therefore, the plants are gradual 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.660
 thinned 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:43.460
 a few more words to cut 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.650
 other spirits very well known and 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:49.240
 The forest is the most cultivated 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.020
 Honeysuckle lonicera confused young 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.020
 and his worries 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:56.900
 this climber similar to that 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:04:00.110
 giant honeysuckle lonicera hildebrand 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:03.760
 gold spirit snare concert halls allah 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.900
 and the red honeysuckle lonicera brownie 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.960
 should not be strong every year 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.030
 cut off these four plants 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:13.550
 bloom best on last year's shoots 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.050
 I will show you these plants first 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.230
 but I cut that Japanese 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.549
 honeysuckle to end 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.439
 this is how the plant looks after the cut 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.879
 out 

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:24.419
 she could have been cut shorter 

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:26.159
 can 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.830
 but that's the way the plant has enough 

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:34.949
 Free space many branched shoots and 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:39.719
 well below scheduled clifton where is 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:42.599
 she is beautiful green in the summer this is the 

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:46.460
 sorte hall iana the hardiest species 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:46.460
 the plant species Japanese honeysuckle 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:56.430
 a Polish variety is still growing here 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.650
 the wood spirit leaf because of very intense 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.900
 and pleasantly fragrant flowers too 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:05.099
 Fragrance Cloud allowed the cloud 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:08.389
 named this plant would hardly bloom 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:11.610
 if she had been cut severely 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:13.349
 All dry plants should be pointed 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.229
 however, be removed and the plant 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:18.000
 must be lighted then she will 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:20.150
 bloom beautifully and get better 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.150
 present 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.310
 So we make a light fast 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.980
 different 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:36.540
 there is the captain to 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.090
 for the bells 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:42.230
 but it will not be bad if we have it 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.230
 miss one year 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:48.410
 Immediately we see a clean made 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.410
 and cut plants
