deck of the ship would have done you see
the<00:02:43.630> yardarms<00:02:44.290> move<00:02:44.590> into<00:02:44.799> place<00:02:45.239> trying<00:02:46.239> to

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
the yardarms move into place trying to

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.000 
the yardarms move into place trying to
capture<00:02:46.600> the<00:02:46.930> wind<00:02:47.079> at<00:02:47.260> its<00:02:47.410> best

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
capture the wind at its best

capture the wind at its best
this<00:02:49.730> is<00:02:49.909> the<00:02:50.000> final<00:02:50.390> step<00:02:50.629> in<00:02:50.810> rigging<00:02:51.110> this

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
this is the final step in rigging this

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:55.360 
this is the final step in rigging this
ship<00:02:51.680> model<00:02:52.150> which<00:02:53.150> took<00:02:53.360> about<00:02:53.890> 750<00:02:54.890> hours<00:02:54.920> to

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
ship model which took about 750 hours to

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.619 
ship model which took about 750 hours to
complete<00:02:55.790> to<00:02:55.970> this<00:02:56.120> point<00:02:58.150> once<00:02:59.150> I<00:02:59.299> lay<00:02:59.480> this

00:02:59.619 --> 00:02:59.629 
complete to this point once I lay this

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:01.979 
complete to this point once I lay this
down<00:02:59.689> inside<00:03:00.290> of<00:03:00.409> the<00:03:00.500> blank<00:03:00.799> ins<00:03:01.159> down<00:03:01.400> here

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
down inside of the blank ins down here

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.890 
down inside of the blank ins down here
we'll<00:03:02.989> tie<00:03:03.260> it<00:03:03.319> off<00:03:03.620> and<00:03:03.920> add<00:03:04.790> some<00:03:05.239> rope<00:03:05.450> coils

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
we'll tie it off and add some rope coils

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:13.680 
we'll tie it off and add some rope coils
around<00:03:06.049> it<00:03:06.440> she'll<00:03:07.250> be<00:03:07.370> complete<00:03:09.400> there<00:03:10.400> we<00:03:10.579> go

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.619 

okay<00:03:14.690> here<00:03:15.049> I'll<00:03:15.170> be<00:03:15.319> pulling<00:03:16.310> on<00:03:16.489> one<00:03:16.849> of<00:03:17.480> the

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629 
okay here I'll be pulling on one of the

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.080 
okay here I'll be pulling on one of the
braces<00:03:17.900> has<00:03:18.230> just<00:03:18.560> been<00:03:18.739> strung<00:03:19.489> through<00:03:19.849> the

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
braces has just been strung through the

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.930 
braces has just been strung through the
single<00:03:20.629> pulley<00:03:20.900> blocks<00:03:21.400> coming<00:03:22.400> off<00:03:22.579> the<00:03:22.760> back

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
single pulley blocks coming off the back

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.899 
single pulley blocks coming off the back
of<00:03:22.970> the<00:03:23.239> Royal<00:03:23.480> yardarm<00:03:23.989> and<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:25.310> idea<00:03:25.609> is<00:03:25.730> to

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:25.909 
of the Royal yardarm and the idea is to

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:28.750 
of the Royal yardarm and the idea is to
get<00:03:26.030> the<00:03:26.150> tension<00:03:26.569> between<00:03:26.720> the<00:03:27.430> both<00:03:28.430> of<00:03:28.639> us

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
get the tension between the both of us

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.039 
get the tension between the both of us
both<00:03:29.030> sides<00:03:29.480> right<00:03:29.810> here<00:03:30.079> exactly<00:03:30.470> right

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
both sides right here exactly right

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.660 
both sides right here exactly right
so<00:03:33.049> you<00:03:33.139> tug<00:03:33.379> on<00:03:33.500> it<00:03:33.560> gently<00:03:33.920> on<00:03:34.129> both<00:03:34.340> sides

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
so you tug on it gently on both sides

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.420 
so you tug on it gently on both sides
make<00:03:34.970> sure<00:03:35.030> that<00:03:35.329> it's<00:03:35.510> even<00:03:35.859> and<00:03:36.859> then<00:03:37.040> I<00:03:37.159> hang

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
make sure that it's even and then I hang

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.330 
make sure that it's even and then I hang
a<00:03:37.579> clip<00:03:37.879> weight<00:03:38.209> off<00:03:38.389> of<00:03:38.420> each<00:03:38.750> line<00:03:39.280> until<00:03:40.280> I

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
a clip weight off of each line until I

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.270 
a clip weight off of each line until I
have<00:03:40.579> time<00:03:40.879> to<00:03:40.909> tie<00:03:41.299> it<00:03:41.359> around<00:03:41.510> the<00:03:41.720> blank<00:03:42.079> in

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.520 

here<00:03:46.280> we're<00:03:46.400> going<00:03:46.489> to<00:03:46.549> be<00:03:46.670> installing<00:03:47.500> one<00:03:48.500> of

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
here we're going to be installing one of

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.130 
here we're going to be installing one of
the<00:03:48.650> coiled<00:03:49.040> ropes<00:03:50.109> on<00:03:51.109> The<00:03:51.349> Bling<00:03:51.560> pins

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
the coiled ropes on The Bling pins

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.940 
the coiled ropes on The Bling pins
which<00:03:53.680> will<00:03:53.890> represent<00:03:54.070> the<00:03:55.530> downline<00:03:56.530> on<00:03:56.770> one

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
which will represent the downline on one

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.970 
which will represent the downline on one
of<00:03:56.980> the<00:03:57.160> sales<00:03:58.230> of<00:03:59.230> course<00:03:59.530> there<00:03:59.710> would<00:03:59.830> be<00:03:59.860> a

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
of the sales of course there would be a

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.420 
of the sales of course there would be a
lot<00:04:00.190> of<00:04:00.220> this<00:04:00.430> rope<00:04:00.670> in<00:04:00.820> place

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.000

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.160 
pin small dab of instant glue
liquid-type<00:04:12.939> will<00:04:13.939> help<00:04:14.120> form<00:04:14.510> the<00:04:14.689> rope<00:04:14.870> coil

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
liquid-type will help form the rope coil

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.849 
liquid-type will help form the rope coil
so<00:04:15.439> that<00:04:15.469> it<00:04:15.739> looks<00:04:16.310> like<00:04:16.400> gravity<00:04:17.350> is<00:04:18.350> keeping

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
so that it looks like gravity is keeping

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:20.949 
so that it looks like gravity is keeping
it<00:04:18.949> in<00:04:19.070> place<00:04:19.329> which<00:04:20.329> was<00:04:20.509> the<00:04:20.630> way<00:04:20.720> it<00:04:20.810> would

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
it in place which was the way it would

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.040 
it in place which was the way it would
be<00:04:21.079> on<00:04:21.169> a<00:04:21.199> real<00:04:21.500> ship<00:04:22.090> and<00:04:23.090> here<00:04:23.539> we<00:04:23.660> can<00:04:23.870> see

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
be on a real ship and here we can see

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:37.020 
be on a real ship and here we can see
the<00:04:24.520> completed<00:04:25.520> rope<00:04:25.729> coils<00:04:26.120> in<00:04:26.270> place

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.300 

seems<00:04:37.690> we<00:04:37.990> found<00:04:38.230> on<00:04:38.380> the<00:04:38.470> starboard<00:04:38.860> side<00:04:38.920> of

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
seems we found on the starboard side of

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.610 
seems we found on the starboard side of
course

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.260 

take<00:04:44.620> one<00:04:44.800> quick<00:04:45.010> look<00:04:45.070> at<00:04:45.400> this<00:04:45.550> Blaine<00:04:46.000> and

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
take one quick look at this Blaine and

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.060 
take one quick look at this Blaine and
rock<00:04:46.480> over<00:04:46.810> here<00:04:46.840> we'll<00:04:47.290> see<00:04:47.500> how<00:04:47.740> it<00:04:47.890> looks

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
rock over here we'll see how it looks

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.190 
rock over here we'll see how it looks
now
