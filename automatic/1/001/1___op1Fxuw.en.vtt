00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
as well you might want to water it down

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.070 
as well you might want to water it down
you<00:00:20.850> have<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:21.060> play<00:00:21.270> with<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.539> texture<00:00:21.930> a

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
you have to play with the texture a

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.230 
you have to play with the texture a
little<00:00:22.199> bit<00:00:22.470> you<00:00:23.070> could<00:00:23.310> add<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.519> little<00:00:23.850> bit<00:00:24.119> of

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
little bit you could add a little bit of

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.990 
little bit you could add a little bit of
water<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:25.070> bring<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.220> down<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.760> nice

water to bring it down to a nice

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.689 
water to bring it down to a nice
workable<00:00:27.539> thing<00:00:27.990> just<00:00:28.260> try<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.710> try<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.369> out

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
workable thing just try it try it out

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:36.110 
workable thing just try it try it out
first<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.869> see<00:00:31.800> how<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:32.160> goes<00:00:34.790> the<00:00:35.790> decoupage

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
first and see how it goes the decoupage

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.459 
first and see how it goes the decoupage
glue<00:00:36.360> gives<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:37.020> little<00:00:37.200> bit<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:38.129> harder

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:39.469 
glue gives a little bit of a harder

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:44.330 
glue gives a little bit of a harder
finish<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:40.890> will<00:00:41.040> resist<00:00:41.660> water<00:00:43.309> so<00:00:44.309> that

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
finish and it will resist water so that

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.229 
finish and it will resist water so that
the<00:00:44.910> when<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.390> do<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.690> dishes<00:00:46.489> you<00:00:47.489> can<00:00:47.760> rinse

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
the when you do the dishes you can rinse

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.810 
the when you do the dishes you can rinse
rinse<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.960> off<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.680> can<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.190> can<00:00:50.219> get<00:00:50.610> wet

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
rinse it off and it can it can get wet

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.389 
rinse it off and it can it can get wet
but<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.690> can't<00:00:52.110> soak<00:00:52.649> anything<00:00:55.070> but<00:00:56.070> for

you go very very gently very lightly

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.610 
you go very very gently very lightly
because<00:02:17.980> any<00:02:18.580> any<00:02:19.150> of<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.690> napkin<00:02:20.350> that<00:02:20.440> has

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
because any any of the napkin that has

because any any of the napkin that has
been<00:02:20.860> soaking<00:02:21.310> in<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.940> glue<00:02:22.209> for<00:02:22.420> any<00:02:22.569> time

been soaking in the glue for any time

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.809 
been soaking in the glue for any time
becomes<00:02:23.980> just<00:02:24.940> a<00:02:25.270> too<00:02:26.230> delicate<00:02:26.530> to<00:02:26.860> play<00:02:27.640> with

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819
