00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.519
 not 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.020
 when there was no such thing as 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.390
 game console and even more so 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.279
 computer we flirt various 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.239
 board games and it was damn 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.640
 great 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.830
 I remember the meter table 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.290
 hockey in which the whole family were cut 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:42.020
 many developers take note of these 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.270
 ideas and they are embodied already in 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.910
 computer games that we will see 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.989
 today also migrated the back of the canopy 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.260
 of our childhood 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.750
 a similar game I had a channel fell with 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.890
 proudly presents a video game review 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.400
 basketball 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.400
 duet 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.000
 I'm sorry but today the review is long 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:06.400
 Does it happen because of all that 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.920
 can you tell about this game 90 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.530
 percent will be personal experiences pier 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.710
 how all this great nostalgia and 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.909
 blah blah blah would avoid this 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.729
 I will try to concretize my 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.680
 the narrative if to be concise then 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.860
 us table basketball 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.200
 the whole point is that there are 8 cells in 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.600
 who dumps the ball and also 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.630
 Each player has 8 buttons which 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.090
 These cells correspond to who is the first 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.970
 will hit its button from that ball and 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.929
 will fly the opponent's basket 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.630
 natural game honed on 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:41.470
 confrontation with a living opponent and 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.440
 not remote 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.960
 and just the one who will be opposite you from 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.300
 what we remember good old gatherings 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.149
 in the evenings with friends is when they said 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.869
 something like this mom yak Sonya him a new 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:55.509
 bought the game 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.670
 there is an opportunity to play against the compan 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.130
 Well, this is a training regime and I confess 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.409
 all interest is lost if this game 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.349
 It was only against compoud, it is not 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.599
 it would be necessary or shisha Well genius 

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:09.190
 muddied turn your screen virtual 

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:13.420
 board game for two 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.640
 This is a competent move part of modern 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.220
 technology made it possible to embellish 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.920
 the game why she migrated to 3d and we 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.440
 we can see the real pseudo stadium 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.920
 with the audience at which our 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.590
 fights 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.930
 the game is made on a unit from which to show 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.209
 pleased with the cool picture and 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.060
 opportunity to arrange a real tournament 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.400
 if you have more than two houses there 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.280
 and noisy company under the cap craves 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.580
 entertainment place your tablet on a chair and 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.129
 Aida chopped just good mood 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.470
 guaranteed for all the only 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:49.720
 unpleasant moment in such a company 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.209
 Anyone with a species can on the tablet 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.520
 vdrit a peak and not a finger say a bottle 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.470
 but this is the cost of production 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.990
 also the game is not very suitable for 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.960
 8 inch small screens it seems to me 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.940
 minimum comfortable size for those 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.880
 who is not in the subject of the game may seem 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.730
 too simple and naive but trust me 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.560
 behind such simple concepts lie 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.140
 thousands of fun days 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.930
 which we now recall a little with 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.660
 sad all i-7 and the next i want 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.030
 see the realization of the Soviet hockey was 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:26.730
 would be great on sim all with you was kinat 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.730
 watch other videos on the channel bye
