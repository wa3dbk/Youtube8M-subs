we're<00:00:33.820> going<00:00:34.000> to<00:00:34.120> be<00:00:34.180> spraying<00:00:34.660> the<00:00:35.379> casting

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:35.949 
we're going to be spraying the casting

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:38.610 
we're going to be spraying the casting
blend<00:00:36.220> into<00:00:36.489> the<00:00:36.730> form<00:00:37.059> to<00:00:37.660> about<00:00:38.080> a<00:00:38.110> quarter

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
blend into the form to about a quarter

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.369 
blend into the form to about a quarter
of<00:00:38.800> an<00:00:39.040> inch<00:00:39.190> on<00:00:39.489> the<00:00:39.730> base<00:00:39.970> and<00:00:40.329> while<00:00:41.079> we're

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379 
of an inch on the base and while we're

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:42.630 
of an inch on the base and while we're
spraying<00:00:41.739> we're<00:00:42.040> gonna<00:00:42.160> have<00:00:42.460> these

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
spraying we're gonna have these

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.260 
spraying we're gonna have these
vibrators<00:00:43.210> going<00:00:43.659> to<00:00:44.409> help<00:00:44.650> insure<00:00:45.610> that<00:00:45.640> the

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
vibrators going to help insure that the

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.410 
vibrators going to help insure that the
that<00:00:46.660> the<00:00:46.750> casting<00:00:47.170> blend<00:00:47.530> is<00:00:47.770> air<00:00:48.610> or<00:00:49.030> bubble

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
that the casting blend is air or bubble

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.750 
that the casting blend is air or bubble
free<00:00:49.809> once<00:00:50.320> it<00:00:50.469> hits<00:00:50.680> the<00:00:50.770> form<00:00:51.129> so<00:00:51.460> when<00:00:51.610> we're

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
free once it hits the form so when we're

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.910 
free once it hits the form so when we're
spraying<00:00:52.059> you'll<00:00:52.420> notice<00:00:52.870> that<00:00:53.320> the<00:00:53.590> the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
spraying you'll notice that the the

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.430 
spraying you'll notice that the the
casting<00:00:54.430> balloon<00:00:54.640> levels<00:00:55.120> out<00:00:55.329> and<00:00:55.600> a<00:00:56.260> lot<00:00:56.410> of

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
casting balloon levels out and a lot of

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.229 
casting balloon levels out and a lot of
little<00:00:56.620> air<00:00:56.890> bubbles<00:00:57.250> will<00:00:57.399> percolate<00:00:57.699> up<00:00:58.030> to

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
little air bubbles will percolate up to

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:10.340 
little air bubbles will percolate up to
the<00:00:58.329> surface<00:00:58.750> of<00:00:58.930> escape

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.929 

after<00:01:11.350> we've<00:01:11.530> sprayed<00:01:11.950> the<00:01:12.219> casting<00:01:12.700> blend

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:12.939 
after we've sprayed the casting blend

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:15.719 
after we've sprayed the casting blend
into<00:01:13.119> the<00:01:13.329> mold<00:01:13.600> base<00:01:13.840> and<00:01:14.229> then<00:01:15.009> sprayed<00:01:15.460> up

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
into the mold base and then sprayed up

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:16.770 
into the mold base and then sprayed up
the<00:01:15.909> sidewalls

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
the sidewalls

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.499 
the sidewalls
we're<00:01:17.380> going<00:01:17.590> to<00:01:17.710> be<00:01:17.859> using<00:01:18.490> a<00:01:18.700> blend<00:01:19.179> a

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
we're going to be using a blend a

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:21.810 
we're going to be using a blend a
combination<00:01:20.380> of<00:01:20.590> both<00:01:20.860> the<00:01:21.039> casting<00:01:21.520> blend

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
combination of both the casting blend

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.760 
combination of both the casting blend
and<00:01:22.030> the<00:01:22.270> backing<00:01:22.509> blend<00:01:23.049> we're<00:01:23.560> gonna<00:01:23.649> be

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
and the backing blend we're gonna be

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.980 
and the backing blend we're gonna be
mixing<00:01:23.979> those<00:01:24.340> together<00:01:24.729> in<00:01:25.210> a<00:01:25.299> 50/50

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
mixing those together in a 50/50

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.399 
mixing those together in a 50/50
proportion<00:01:26.619> to<00:01:27.219> give<00:01:27.399> us<00:01:27.520> a<00:01:27.610> nice<00:01:28.409> thick

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
proportion to give us a nice thick

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.940 
proportion to give us a nice thick
consistency<00:01:29.909> mix<00:01:30.959> that's<00:01:31.959> a<00:01:32.229> little<00:01:32.679> thicker

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
consistency mix that's a little thicker

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.940 
consistency mix that's a little thicker
than<00:01:33.280> the<00:01:33.549> casting<00:01:33.939> blend<00:01:34.179> on<00:01:34.329> its<00:01:34.569> own<00:01:34.750> but<00:01:35.740> a

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
than the casting blend on its own but a

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.889 
than the casting blend on its own but a
little<00:01:36.250> thinner<00:01:36.520> than<00:01:36.819> the<00:01:37.060> backing<00:01:37.420> blend<00:01:37.719> on

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
little thinner than the backing blend on

little thinner than the backing blend on
its<00:01:38.110> own<00:01:38.289> and<00:01:38.590> what<00:01:39.100> that<00:01:39.250> allows<00:01:39.610> us<00:01:39.640> to<00:01:39.909> do<00:01:40.270> is

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:40.569 
its own and what that allows us to do is

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:42.960 
its own and what that allows us to do is
come<00:01:41.229> on<00:01:41.409> top<00:01:41.770> of<00:01:42.100> the<00:01:42.189> casting<00:01:42.610> blend<00:01:42.849> that

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
come on top of the casting blend that

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.109 
come on top of the casting blend that
we've<00:01:43.119> sprayed<00:01:43.569> with<00:01:44.439> a<00:01:44.739> half-inch<00:01:45.399> layer<00:01:45.789> of

we're<00:01:59.709> gonna<00:01:59.799> go<00:02:00.069> ahead<00:02:00.220> and<00:02:00.429> build<00:02:01.270> a

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
we're gonna go ahead and build a

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.109 
we're gonna go ahead and build a
two-inch<00:02:01.929> high<00:02:02.140> rim<00:02:02.469> all<00:02:03.009> the<00:02:03.069> way<00:02:03.399> around<00:02:03.520> the

exterior or the perimeter here and then
we're<00:02:06.849> gonna<00:02:06.909> make<00:02:07.239> it<00:02:07.420> about<00:02:07.840> 3/4<00:02:08.709> of<00:02:08.739> an<00:02:08.979> inch

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
we're gonna make it about 3/4 of an inch

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.699 
we're gonna make it about 3/4 of an inch
thick<00:02:09.489> we'll<00:02:10.299> also<00:02:10.539> do<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:10.989> same<00:02:11.230> around<00:02:11.410> this

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
thick we'll also do the same around this

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.460 
thick we'll also do the same around this
knockout<00:02:12.250> and<00:02:12.519> when<00:02:13.420> we're<00:02:13.599> done<00:02:13.810> what<00:02:14.319> you'll

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
knockout and when we're done what you'll

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.789 
knockout and when we're done what you'll
see<00:02:14.739> is<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.940> nominal<00:02:16.600> thickness<00:02:17.109> of<00:02:17.290> this<00:02:17.500> of
