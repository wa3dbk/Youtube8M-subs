the<00:00:10.349> thinness<00:00:10.680> of<00:00:11.100> this<00:00:11.250> bracket<00:00:11.880> this<00:00:12.330> is<00:00:12.390> the

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
the thinness of this bracket this is the

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.740 
the thinness of this bracket this is the
only<00:00:12.840> steel<00:00:13.320> part<00:00:13.710> on<00:00:13.950> here<00:00:14.250> this<00:00:14.940> bracket<00:00:15.599> is

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
only steel part on here this bracket is

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.349 
only steel part on here this bracket is
welded<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.529> your<00:00:16.560> pivot<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.310> as<00:00:17.699> you<00:00:17.880> can<00:00:18.090> see

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
welded to your pivot and as you can see

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.300 
welded to your pivot and as you can see
it<00:00:19.349> pivot<00:00:19.919> there<00:00:20.429> is<00:00:20.609> no<00:00:20.909> flex<00:00:21.329> here<00:00:21.689> no<00:00:22.679> flex

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
it pivot there is no flex here no flex

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.279 
it pivot there is no flex here no flex
and<00:00:23.909> that's<00:00:24.119> because<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.689> sleeve<00:00:25.019> that's

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
and that's because the sleeve that's

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.489 
and that's because the sleeve that's

stop between the two of them is less
than<00:00:39.480> three<00:00:39.809> thousandths<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:40.679> that's<00:00:41.250> why<00:00:41.519> you

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
than three thousandths so that's why you

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.700 
than three thousandths so that's why you
have<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.170> click<00:00:43.170> click<00:00:44.179> it's<00:00:45.179> working<00:00:45.780> when

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
have that click click it's working when

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.740 
have that click click it's working when
you<00:00:46.829> look<00:00:47.039> at<00:00:47.190> this<00:00:47.429> this<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:47.850> hollow<00:00:48.239> all<00:00:48.570> the

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
you look at this this is hollow all the

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.079 
you look at this this is hollow all the
way<00:00:48.870> through<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.589> weighs<00:00:49.859> nothing<00:00:50.190> this

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:51.089 
way through it weighs nothing this

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:53.209 
way through it weighs nothing this
weighs<00:00:51.420> nothing<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.260> aluminum<00:00:52.800> and

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
weighs nothing this is aluminum and

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.610 
weighs nothing this is aluminum and
we'll<00:00:53.910> use<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.300> stainless<00:00:54.660> steel<00:00:54.960> lens

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
we'll use the stainless steel lens

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.430 
we'll use the stainless steel lens
instead<00:00:56.429> of<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.730> really<00:00:57.089> creepy<00:00:57.690> ones<00:00:57.899> so

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
instead of the really creepy ones so

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.619 
instead of the really creepy ones so

when you buy a set of our controls we
can<00:01:00.870> set<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.440> distance<00:01:01.739> from<00:01:02.249> the<00:01:02.429> edge<00:01:02.579> of

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
can set the distance from the edge of

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.180 
can set the distance from the edge of
the<00:01:02.879> bike<00:01:03.089> out<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.570> here<00:01:03.870> sell<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.769> entire

see the offset in the break on the other

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.040 
see the offset in the break on the other
side<00:01:11.100> plus<00:01:11.970> we<00:01:12.240> have<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.450> different<00:01:12.870> all

material that you don't have to have

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.570 
material that you don't have to have

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
because the pedal assembly is steel

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.010

everything else is aluminum and that's

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.590 
everything else is aluminum and that's
the<00:01:43.260> shift<00:01:43.530> side<00:01:43.860> if<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.700> require<00:01:45.120> the<00:01:45.390> thing

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
the shift side if you require the thing

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.160 
the shift side if you require the thing
for<00:01:45.900> if<00:01:46.830> you<00:01:47.010> require<00:01:47.400> an<00:01:48.030> offset<00:01:48.240> we<00:01:48.870> can<00:01:49.050> do

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
for if you require an offset we can do

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.780 
for if you require an offset we can do
that<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.620> just<00:01:49.920> tell<00:01:50.070> us<00:01:50.130> what<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.490> got<00:01:50.640> to

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
that to you just tell us what you got to

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.200 
that to you just tell us what you got to
have<00:01:51.140> let's<00:01:52.140> look<00:01:52.350> at<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.710> brake<00:01:53.520> side<00:01:53.850> over

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
have let's look at the brake side over

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.420 
have let's look at the brake side over
there<00:01:54.360> because<00:01:54.930> it's<00:01:55.110> cool<00:01:55.380> brake<00:01:55.770> side<00:01:56.100> now

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
there because it's cool brake side now

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.960 
there because it's cool brake side now
and<00:01:56.970> you<00:01:57.120> can<00:01:57.330> see<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:58.260> exact<00:01:58.800> same<00:01:59.190> set<00:01:59.580> up<00:01:59.760> is

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
and you can see the exact same set up is

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.570 
and you can see the exact same set up is
the<00:02:00.120> other<00:02:00.300> side<00:02:00.920> it's<00:02:01.920> got<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.310> drill

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
the other side it's got the drill

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.220 
flappers on it it's got all of this
stuff<00:02:04.800> but<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.580> see<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.970> offset<00:02:06.540> right<00:02:06.840> here

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.230 
stuff but you see the offset right here

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.190 
stuff but you see the offset right here
this<00:02:07.920> bike<00:02:08.220> has<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.489> drum<00:02:09.000> brake<00:02:09.300> on<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.869> and
