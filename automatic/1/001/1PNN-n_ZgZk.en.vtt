two without that I microphone in with
the<00:01:08.040> first<00:01:08.310> recording<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.380> without<00:01:10.380> the

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
the first recording is without the

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.920 
the first recording is without the
microphone<00:01:11.490> as<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.850> can<00:01:12.000> tell<00:01:12.180> it's<00:01:12.390> just<00:01:12.720> a

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
microphone as you can tell it's just a

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.450 
microphone as you can tell it's just a
little<00:01:13.080> bit<00:01:13.260> from<00:01:13.439> my<00:01:13.619> face<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.100> it's<00:01:14.250> not<00:01:14.340> that

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
little bit from my face so it's not that

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.350 
little bit from my face so it's not that
far<00:01:14.790> away<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:16.520> if<00:01:17.520> we<00:01:17.670> play<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.030> one<00:01:18.180> back

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
far away and if we play that one back

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.719 
far away and if we play that one back
without<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:19.380> microphone<00:01:20.009> as<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.400> can<00:01:20.549> tell

without I microphone as you can tell
it's<00:01:20.939> just<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.450> little<00:01:21.659> bit<00:01:21.810> for<00:01:22.049> my<00:01:22.170> face<00:01:22.350> so

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
it's just a little bit for my face so

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.330 
it's just a little bit for my face so
it's<00:01:22.799> not<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:22.979> far<00:01:23.280> away<00:01:24.740> so<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:26.040> know<00:01:26.130> it

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
it's not that far away so you know it

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.149 
it's not that far away so you know it
sounds<00:01:26.610> okay<00:01:26.880> when<00:01:27.750> it's<00:01:27.869> by<00:01:28.049> itself<00:01:28.380> let's

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
sounds okay when it's by itself let's

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.719 
sounds okay when it's by itself let's
try<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.460> with<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.820> microphone<00:01:30.710> and<00:01:31.729> I'll

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
try it with the I microphone and I'll

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.490 
try it with the I microphone and I'll
start<00:01:32.939> testing<00:01:33.329> now<00:01:33.450> again<00:01:33.900> just<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.320> couple

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
start testing now again just a couple

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.109 
start testing now again just a couple
inches<00:01:34.590> from<00:01:34.920> my<00:01:35.100> face<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.520> it's<00:01:35.640> not<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:35.850> far

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
inches from my face so it's not that far

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.149 
inches from my face so it's not that far
away<00:01:36.270> probably<00:01:36.869> ideal<00:01:37.259> for<00:01:37.530> interviews<00:01:37.979> or

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
table here and we'll see how it does

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:50.030 
table here and we'll see how it does
take<00:01:45.329> out<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:45.600> microphone<00:01:48.500> my<00:01:49.500> probably

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
in addition it just the clarity goes way

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.669 
in addition it just the clarity goes way
up<00:02:07.849> what<00:02:08.849> note<00:02:09.090> I<00:02:09.270> did<00:02:09.450> want<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.750> make<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.200> one

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
up what note I did want to make and one

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.740 
up what note I did want to make and one
thing<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:10.920> kind<00:02:11.879> of<00:02:11.940> tripped<00:02:12.180> me<00:02:12.330> up<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.690> it

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
thing that kind of tripped me up and it

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.730 
thing that kind of tripped me up and it
would<00:02:12.900> be<00:02:13.020> my<00:02:13.140> only<00:02:13.290> criticism

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
would be my only criticism

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.240

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
my playback earlier when I was testing

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.120 
my playback earlier when I was testing
it<00:02:23.970> out<00:02:24.090> without<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:25.050> camera<00:02:25.410> recording<00:02:25.920> and

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
it out without the camera recording and

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.730 
it out without the camera recording and
I<00:02:27.030> was<00:02:27.300> listening<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:27.810> it<00:02:27.960> trying<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.470> listen

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
to it and I didn't know why I wasn't

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.780 
to it and I didn't know why I wasn't
hearing<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.380> playback<00:02:31.800> until<00:02:32.310> I<00:02:32.370> figured<00:02:32.700> out

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
hearing the playback until I figured out

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.850

oh<00:02:33.000> I<00:02:33.360> have<00:02:33.600> to<00:02:33.630> take<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.020> I<00:02:34.050> microphone<00:02:34.650> out

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
oh I have to take the I microphone out

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.520 
oh I have to take the I microphone out
and<00:02:35.160> on<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.910> box<00:02:36.150> there<00:02:36.570> is<00:02:36.600> actually<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.260> note

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
and on the box there is actually a note

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.800

when I microphone is connected to audio
jack<00:02:40.050> speakers<00:02:40.560> may<00:02:40.950> be<00:02:41.600> disabled<00:02:42.600> so<00:02:43.530> it's<00:02:43.890> a

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
jack speakers may be disabled so it's a
