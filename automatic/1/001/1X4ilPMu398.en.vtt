gumball techcom and in this video I'm

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.520 
gumball techcom and in this video I'm
going<00:00:11.759> to<00:00:11.849> show<00:00:12.090> you<00:00:12.120> how<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.420> add<00:00:12.630> more<00:00:13.110> memory

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
going to show you how to add more memory

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.460 
going to show you how to add more memory
to<00:00:13.559> your<00:00:14.070> iPhone<00:00:14.490> or<00:00:14.670> iPod<00:00:14.940> Touch<00:00:15.230> now<00:00:16.230> this

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
to your iPhone or iPod Touch now this

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.830 
to your iPhone or iPod Touch now this
doesn't<00:00:16.680> actually<00:00:16.949> add<00:00:17.310> physical<00:00:18.060> RAM<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.690> it

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
doesn't actually add physical RAM to it

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.000 
doesn't actually add physical RAM to it
but<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:20.010> instead<00:00:20.580> gives<00:00:21.480> your<00:00:21.869> iPhone<00:00:22.529> or<00:00:22.710> iPod

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
but it instead gives your iPhone or iPod

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.670 
but it instead gives your iPhone or iPod
Touch<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.550> capability<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.570> use<00:00:25.050> virtual

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
Touch the capability to use virtual

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.519 
Touch the capability to use virtual
memory<00:00:26.180> so<00:00:27.180> now<00:00:27.599> what<00:00:27.810> this<00:00:27.930> means<00:00:28.170> is<00:00:28.500> that

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
memory so now what this means is that

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.400 
memory so now what this means is that
you'll<00:00:28.920> get<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.340> little<00:00:29.640> boost<00:00:29.910> in<00:00:30.090> performance

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
you'll get a little boost in performance

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.040 
you'll get a little boost in performance
you<00:00:31.410> know<00:00:31.529> running<00:00:31.769> game<00:00:32.040> opening<00:00:32.730> apps

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
you know running game opening apps

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.110 
you know running game opening apps
things<00:00:34.050> like<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.579> so<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.700> first<00:00:35.910> thing<00:00:36.030> you

things like that so the first thing you
need<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.300> do<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.809> open<00:00:37.710> up<00:00:37.800> cydia<00:00:42.260> and<00:00:43.260> then

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
need to do is open up cydia and then

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.090 
need to do is open up cydia and then
once<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.550> loads<00:00:44.670> just<00:00:45.440> you<00:00:46.440> have<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.680> add<00:00:46.800> our

once it loads just you have to add our

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.610 
once it loads just you have to add our

actually need to do this properly you
can<00:01:35.369> just<00:01:35.490> go<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.729> power<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.240> then<00:01:37.170> reboot

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
can just go to the power and then reboot

can just go to the power and then reboot
now<00:01:39.780> when<00:01:40.020> your<00:01:40.140> device<00:01:40.380> reboots<00:01:40.590> you

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
now when your device reboots you

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.429 
now when your device reboots you
shouldn't<00:01:41.850> know<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.659> shouldn't<00:01:42.899> notice<00:01:43.229> any

shouldn't know you shouldn't notice any
change<00:01:44.869> to<00:01:45.869> actually<00:01:46.350> use<00:01:47.159> this<00:01:47.640> properly<00:01:48.420> you

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
change to actually use this properly you

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.730 
change to actually use this properly you
need<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.229> open<00:01:49.560> up<00:01:49.770> SB<00:01:50.189> settings<00:01:54.590> and<00:01:55.590> then<00:01:55.710> you

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
need to open up SB settings and then you

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.300 
need to open up SB settings and then you
need<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.009> do<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.729> free<00:01:57.509> memory<00:01:57.750> run<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:59.100> just

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
need to do a free memory run you just

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:08.930 
need to do a free memory run you just
tap<00:01:59.520> on<00:01:59.670> the

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.340 

just<00:02:09.940> step<00:02:10.090> on<00:02:10.240> the<00:02:10.270> processes<00:02:11.080> to<00:02:11.340> toggle<00:02:12.340> and

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
just step on the processes to toggle and

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.020 
just step on the processes to toggle and
then<00:02:14.350> free<00:02:15.340> up<00:02:15.520> memory<00:02:17.520> now<00:02:18.520> this<00:02:18.790> process

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
then free up memory now this process

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.930 
then free up memory now this process
could<00:02:19.420> take<00:02:19.600> anywhere<00:02:19.990> from<00:02:20.350> 30<00:02:21.160> to<00:02:21.340> 45

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
could take anywhere from 30 to 45

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.260 
could take anywhere from 30 to 45
seconds<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:22.750> your<00:02:22.870> device<00:02:23.110> may<00:02:23.500> become

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
seconds and your device may become

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.020 
seconds and your device may become
unresponsive<00:02:25.270> during<00:02:26.020> this<00:02:26.110> time<00:02:26.640> so<00:02:27.640> don't

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
unresponsive during this time so don't

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.640 
unresponsive during this time so don't
worry<00:02:28.120> about<00:02:28.240> it<00:02:28.450> just<00:02:28.810> wait<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:31.230> then<00:02:32.230> as<00:02:32.470> you

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
worry about it just wait and then as you

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.240 
worry about it just wait and then as you
can<00:02:32.770> see<00:02:33.010> well<00:02:34.000> it's<00:02:34.390> still<00:02:34.600> not<00:02:34.690> done<00:02:35.250> like

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
can see well it's still not done like

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.020 
can see well it's still not done like
when<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.180> processes<00:02:37.959> toggle<00:02:38.860> goes<00:02:39.130> away<00:02:39.459> you

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
when the processes toggle goes away you

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.600 
when the processes toggle goes away you
still<00:02:40.239> have<00:02:40.450> to<00:02:40.570> wait<00:02:40.690> a<00:02:40.720> little<00:02:40.930> while<00:02:41.080> for<00:02:41.610> it

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
still have to wait a little while for it

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.900 
still have to wait a little while for it
to<00:02:42.640> finish<00:02:43.209> its<00:02:43.540> stuff<00:02:44.580> so<00:02:45.580> we're<00:02:45.700> just<00:02:45.730> gonna

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
to finish its stuff so we're just gonna

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:53.589 
to finish its stuff so we're just gonna
wait<00:02:46.150> a<00:02:46.180> little<00:02:46.360> bit<00:02:46.540> longer

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.619 

all<00:02:54.599> right<00:02:54.780> now<00:02:54.989> as<00:02:55.290> you<00:02:55.410> can<00:02:55.530> see<00:02:55.590> I<00:02:56.099> have<00:02:56.910> 80

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
all right now as you can see I have 80

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:01.509 
all right now as you can see I have 80
Meg's<00:02:58.019> of<00:02:58.379> available<00:02:59.190> memory<00:03:00.080> that's<00:03:01.080> almost

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
Meg's of available memory that's almost

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:08.420 
Meg's of available memory that's almost
double<00:03:02.519> what<00:03:04.910> people<00:03:05.910> usually<00:03:06.060> have<00:03:07.340> then<00:03:08.340> you

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
double what people usually have then you

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.070 
double what people usually have then you
could<00:03:08.550> close<00:03:08.730> out<00:03:08.910> of<00:03:08.940> SB<00:03:09.269> settings<00:03:09.629> and<00:03:09.989> you

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
could close out of SB settings and you

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.320 
could close out of SB settings and you
could<00:03:10.230> go<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.500> whatever<00:03:10.890> you<00:03:11.099> want

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
could go to whatever you want

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.210 
could go to whatever you want
I<00:03:12.360> did<00:03:13.170> notice<00:03:13.349> the<00:03:13.500> slight<00:03:13.830> performance

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
I did notice the slight performance

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.920 
I did notice the slight performance
increase<00:03:16.250> loading<00:03:17.250> simple<00:03:17.970> apps<00:03:18.150> is<00:03:18.629> a<00:03:18.660> little

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
increase loading simple apps is a little

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.190 
increase loading simple apps is a little
bit<00:03:19.049> quicker<00:03:20.390> right<00:03:21.390> there<00:03:21.569> it<00:03:21.629> was<00:03:21.750> pretty

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
bit quicker right there it was pretty

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.890 
bit quicker right there it was pretty
slow<00:03:22.410> but<00:03:22.970> it's<00:03:23.970> mainly<00:03:24.090> for<00:03:24.330> running<00:03:24.660> games

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
slow but it's mainly for running games

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.400 
slow but it's mainly for running games
that<00:03:25.200> use<00:03:25.380> a<00:03:25.500> lot<00:03:25.530> of<00:03:25.680> memory<00:03:25.890> like<00:03:27.319> some<00:03:28.319> of

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
that use a lot of memory like some of

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.080 
that use a lot of memory like some of
the<00:03:28.470> Need<00:03:28.620> for<00:03:28.650> Speed<00:03:28.829> games<00:03:29.250> will<00:03:29.640> probably

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
the Need for Speed games will probably

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.610 
the Need for Speed games will probably
run<00:03:30.510> better<00:03:32.510> GTA<00:03:33.510> could<00:03:33.840> probably<00:03:34.019> run<00:03:34.380> pretty

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
run better GTA could probably run pretty

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.539 
run better GTA could probably run pretty
good<00:03:35.209> especially<00:03:36.209> asphalt<00:03:36.870> 5<00:03:37.190> that<00:03:38.190> runs<00:03:38.400> a

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
good especially asphalt 5 that runs a

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.940 
good especially asphalt 5 that runs a
lot<00:03:38.760> better<00:03:39.000> now<00:03:39.450> than<00:03:39.930> it<00:03:39.989> did<00:03:40.230> without<00:03:40.620> the

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
lot better now than it did without the

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.410 
lot better now than it did without the
memory<00:03:41.280> enhancer<00:03:43.430> but<00:03:44.430> do<00:03:44.610> use<00:03:44.849> this<00:03:45.030> at<00:03:45.209> your

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
memory enhancer but do use this at your

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.789 
memory enhancer but do use this at your
own<00:03:45.480> risk<00:03:47.660> for<00:03:48.660> some<00:03:48.870> people<00:03:49.230> makes<00:03:49.530> things

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
own risk for some people makes things

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.190 
own risk for some people makes things
faster<00:03:50.010> some<00:03:50.730> people<00:03:51.120> they<00:03:51.780> don't<00:03:52.079> really

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
faster some people they don't really

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.559 
faster some people they don't really
notice<00:03:52.560> a<00:03:52.799> change<00:03:52.829> some<00:03:53.610> people<00:03:54.000> makes<00:03:54.329> things

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
notice a change some people makes things

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.780 
notice a change some people makes things
slower<00:03:54.930> so<00:03:55.920> you<00:03:55.950> just<00:03:56.190> have<00:03:56.310> to<00:03:56.400> try<00:03:56.579> it<00:03:56.640> out

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
slower so you just have to try it out

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.979 
slower so you just have to try it out
and<00:03:57.109> you<00:03:58.109> know<00:03:58.230> see<00:03:59.239> what<00:04:00.239> your<00:04:00.480> experience<00:04:00.930> is

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
and you know see what your experience is
