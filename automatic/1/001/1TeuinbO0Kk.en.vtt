00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
 so today the time is 

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:04.009
 particularly covered in camargue 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.299
 not a lot of sun 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.820
 so I left the holy maries 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.759
 from the sea I came to yom dead here 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.910
 in little camargue to go to the 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.920
 discovery of the fort of pk is an ancient 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.230
 stronghold that defends the region formerly 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.910
 against the pirates this will be our 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:26.580
 route number 4 I 'm going along the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.150
 Burgundy canal in the absence of 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.250
 beaconing 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:35.219
 I hesitate rather quickly between right bank and 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:37.230
 left bank I'm trying the left so I 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.850
 I am a little bit short and way I 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.040
 I engaged on a private property 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.840
 so I'm thinking of winning 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.890
 who work here I'm getting back 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.720
 in a truck nicely 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.020
 to hangman actually left the path he 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:54.060
 is 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.650
 on the other side and panic she's me 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.070
 here is back on the right track 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.060
 my drop a little bit further to 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.470
 explain the way it's true that 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.199
 it was more marked so it suddenly 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.400
 well we hesitate a little what is it 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.650
 sees that the region is not really a 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.479
 region adapted to the practice of hiking 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.640
 sometimes there is markup times there are 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.340
 no there are ten panels there are more one 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.570
 get along like ben hiba he does not have 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.850
 bibi card it happens to him from this summit 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.500
 I ended up finding the big track 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:28.200
 coming from elsewhere just dead at the edge 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:33.090
 of cities there I turned just now 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:35.040
 I left on my private the communal which 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.220
 was trophy bowl atmosphere with the 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.220
 car 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.940
 on the other hand there is something that is not 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.270
 cool who had not the days before 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.660
 in the corner it's mosquitoes are 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.360
 returned 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.710
 surely because it's clear that the 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.390
 temperature is damn being in the process of 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:06.330
 ride up 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.330
 and shit me I'm boring shorts 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.350
 at 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:24.200
 at the end of the track I finally arrive at 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.349
 strong peace what it is I am 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:34.400
 arrived at the port of peace qais al altitude 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:37.450
 record of 1 m it will take right there in the 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:41.420
 half concealed vegetation 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:45.379
 we will explore his slab the adventurer 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.120
 means built in 15 168 lefort 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:49.579
 served as a monitoring post 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.849
 advanced harvesting and trade of 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:58.870
 salt go the moats this side 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:58.870
 impassable I believe that ag 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:17.819
 e 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.030
 m 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:50.549
 I tell you that I deserve this strong 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.870
 so the story in detail with the 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.389
 dates there I do not have right here right now 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.389
 but all that remains in fact all 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:04.060
 these ruins so it was an old one 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:06.609
 old fort that had been built for 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.389
 securing the salt industry 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:12.400
 here in the vicinity of aigues-mortes 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:15.760
 since these were reserves that was 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.220
 often looted and ransacked there was 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.989
 also from piracy one who came there 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.090
 came from the sea and all the salads that 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:25.930
 was around so were some 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:29.710
 so protected by this fort so we 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.720
 also finds remains of the remains 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.690
 that have nothing to do with the time of 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.599
 piracy which are dated rather from the 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:40.630
 World War II since the 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:41.710
 Germans had installed bunkers 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.190
 and casemates 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.340
 in addition here when he had occupied the 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.340
 position 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:51.490
 I still have a few minutes in this 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.320
 high place of the story that seems 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.500
 now forgotten by all in the midst of 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.500
 rooms 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:05.559
 before turning around at the pace 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:09.009
 why all these birds there at the bottom 

00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:12.249
 all this fuss and walked a little bit the 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:14.429
 along the canal towards the other 

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:14.429
 side 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.170
 and simple 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:24.069
 it is not very often that we 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.830
 can enjoy a small path there 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:28.410
 like this one it's really in the middle 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:32.819
 vegetation 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.819
 it's nice it changes everything 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:44.870
 my road finally runs up against 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:46.220
 fences and closed doors I 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.240
 maybe I was a little bit inflamed 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.550
 saying that I was going to be able to follow 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.350
 indefinitely the channel in fact it's a 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.660
 little bit of concern in the sector 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:57.350
 aftermath everything is closed private 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:59.480
 mesh we can not go what when 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:02.120
 not even do the outlaws by 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:05.750
 against the help the surrounding area 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:09.010
 forgiveness of the fort are absolutely splendid 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:14.110
 what there all I have there down right 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:14.110
 it's a wild it's really beautiful 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.540
 he is 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.240
 here is this new route touches 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.580
 now to an end 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.560
 it's time for me to go back to my 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.690
 starting point and for you to follow 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:44.000
 on the next route that has always 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:46.009
 for decoration the little camargue and more 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.110
 precisely the big raft and 

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:50.139
 the mouth of the little rhÃ´ne has everything 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.139
 after
