00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.500

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.019

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.490
 movie screens uncertain and even to 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.809
 second time lately in one 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:19.380
 comedy here specifically one 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:20.939
 action comedy in my vita family it 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.680
 There was a time when I had everything 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.699
 everybody asked me how is that 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.699
 to be untouchable 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.470
 the question they really have 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.950
 should be asked is what if that 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.950
 all over 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.460

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.850

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.380
 they are not in the blood next 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.480
 farther away from print than this 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.470
 I have rats show protection programs 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.330

 well you know what happens if this 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.220
 you can find that they are for that 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.350
 confess me the job 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.550
 not unnecessarily difficult 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.030
 It's been years since I was at the 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.030
 confession was 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.620
 why only all the soko 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.930
 and how was the first day not yet 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.930
 especially much 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.899
 Did you kill the plumber? 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.759
 belongs'm born hospitalized me 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:07.960
 and who repairs the robe now and who 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.519
 needs the supermarket again on the 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.519
 Everyday our arrival burned out 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:22.280
 malawi tariff sleeve is 112 minutes 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.670
 released for 16 years and running since 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.560
 last thursday 21 november 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.290
 2013 in German cinemas tells the 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.150
 history of giovanni manzoni he is 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.980
 a big gangster boss in the states 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.960
 especially in new york one of the whole 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.910
 big snappy but his family so 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.440
 the mafia turns against him and he into 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.610
 witness protection program must be together with 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.470
 his family 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.150
 because he becomes a traitor but he wants 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.070
 at least one more to die 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.810
 living in it would depend on it 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.190
 all the time an agent in the neck of the 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.600
 try this whole program too 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.460
 but this family can organize 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.450
 always behave and not 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.340
 always falls in old 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.110
 pattern of behavior into it and so on 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.090
 you from city to city and exactly that 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.830
 Film is currently called family 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.540
 Blake and live somewhere in the 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.710
 normandy in france and can the 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.540
 French actually not so 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.310
 actually no, and it now not 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.200
 alone with his wife and 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.580
 His two children are each 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.410
 every single one of these 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.840
 family members a potential 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.910
 you can almost say hairkiller and 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.440
 so that also marita the family in the 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.660
 action comedy there is a whole lot 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.100
 on shootings of violent acts 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.230
 funny and funny moments 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.920
 supposedly but then not quite so 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.660
 are funny 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.220
 you ask them why in between 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.660
 now robert de niro that here in the 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.830
 main characters next to him you can see too 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.990
 still michelle pfeiffer one of the 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.550
 main characters and tommy lee jones thinks 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.650
 you are great cars and actually 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.270
 yes , really good 530 million 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.340
 dollar budget, however, is somehow 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.110
 it's such a mediocre number where you go 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.670
 it says okay you have to look 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.709
 I do not look at it a few times 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.540
 geschmunzelt in the cinema hall but agree 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.680
 that no criminal buys you that 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.940
 ticket for that you can 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.170
 maybe I borrow the video library 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.000
 I would not even buy the blu-ray 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.560
 because the company mainly that only marco 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.230
 very predictable if you do not 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.180
 robert de niro just loves it like that 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.860
 Luckily, many people find it difficult to do so 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.459
 hand to stay tuned also the 112 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.440
 minutes 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.880
 they just draw but feel that 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.950
 you had already finished when you got the 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.840
 By the way, the trailer had seen as well 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.400
 Already some of the very best 10 unfortunately 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.560
 spoiler has and that is sometimes such a 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.330
 I hear a small certificate of poverty 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.830
 I am neither excited nor totally 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.820
 scared of the movie I have since 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.030
 about as expected 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.500
 malawi the family plays 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.570
 mediocre and much more 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.040
 probably there really been the 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.810
 nice thing is when you are outside of 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.790
 the dialogues sometimes examines the scenes and 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.220
 the music that is really fun 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.169
 console that french mediterranean 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.760
 Therefore, the beautiful sounds but actually 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:35.770
 That should not be the main focus 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.870
 and with that you get beat the family 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.800
 by me as an action comedy four out of ten 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.720
 possible points 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.190
 Overall, I'm even a tick 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.050
 better than this genre five out of ten 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.680
 unfortunately only possible points overall 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.510
 mediocre 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.190
 too bad a pity what the hell 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.680
 it was now with my review to malawi 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.240
 let the family know this 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.710
 We do not like to stay there 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.910
 me over to my cinema reviews or 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.200

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.730
 want to write a bit about movies 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.919
 subscribe to this or my second channel
