being<00:00:51.899> something<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.289> would<00:00:52.530> be<00:00:52.620> useful<00:00:53.010> in

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
being something that would be useful in

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.400 
being something that would be useful in
maybe<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.489> dorm<00:00:53.820> room<00:00:54.079> something<00:00:55.079> where<00:00:55.320> you

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
maybe a dorm room something where you

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.920 
maybe a dorm room something where you
don't<00:00:55.559> have<00:00:55.649> access<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:58.489> you<00:00:59.489> know<00:00:59.609> a<00:01:00.270> stovetop

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
don't have access to you know a stovetop

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.139 
don't have access to you know a stovetop
because<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.620> think<00:01:01.710> stovetop<00:01:02.250> it's<00:01:02.850> almost

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
because I think stovetop it's almost

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.370 
because I think stovetop it's almost
easier<00:01:04.700> than<00:01:05.900> putting<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.140> in<00:01:07.290> the

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
easier than putting this in the

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.550 
easier than putting this in the
microwave<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:08.150> I<00:01:09.150> think<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:10.200> also<00:01:10.439> it's

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
microwave so I think it and also it's

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.800 
microwave so I think it and also it's
more<00:01:10.710> durable<00:01:11.189> than<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:12.060> know<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.210> ceramic

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
more durable than you know a ceramic

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.200 
more durable than you know a ceramic
bowl<00:01:13.650> or<00:01:13.890> something<00:01:14.159> like<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.090> just

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
bowl or something like that so you just

over and over again day-in day-out so

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.109 
over and over again day-in day-out so
this<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:26.310> something<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.759> probably

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
this is something that I probably

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.830 
this is something that I probably
wouldn't<00:01:27.509> use<00:01:27.840> but<00:01:29.450> just<00:01:30.450> right<00:01:30.600> off<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.720> bat

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
but it's a clever idea for people that

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.160 
but it's a clever idea for people that
want<00:02:44.770> a<00:02:44.830> plastic<00:02:45.310> container<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:45.970> cook<00:02:46.900> ramen

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.410 
want a plastic container to cook ramen
soup<00:02:47.650> I<00:02:47.950> could<00:02:48.640> see<00:02:48.790> it<00:02:48.850> being<00:02:48.970> useful<00:02:49.360> and

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
soup I could see it being useful and

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.510 
soup I could see it being useful and
dorm<00:02:50.110> rooms<00:02:50.350> like<00:02:50.530> I<00:02:50.560> said<00:02:50.890> but<00:02:51.100> I'm<00:02:51.190> gonna<00:02:51.280> put

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
dorm rooms like I said but I'm gonna put

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.410 
dorm rooms like I said but I'm gonna put
it<00:02:51.610> in<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.760> microwave<00:02:51.880> for<00:02:52.209> three<00:02:52.390> minutes

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
it in the microwave for three minutes

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.020 
it in the microwave for three minutes
see<00:02:53.230> how<00:02:53.320> it<00:02:53.410> turns<00:02:53.650> out<00:02:53.830> all<00:02:54.640> right<00:02:54.790> so<00:02:54.940> after

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
see how it turns out all right so after

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.430 
see how it turns out all right so after
three<00:02:55.390> minutes<00:02:55.570> this<00:02:55.750> is<00:02:55.870> what<00:02:55.989> the<00:02:56.110> ramen

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
three minutes this is what the ramen

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.100 
three minutes this is what the ramen
noodles<00:02:57.010> look<00:02:57.160> like<00:03:00.209> and<00:03:01.209> they<00:03:01.870> came<00:03:02.080> out

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
noodles look like and they came out

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.760 
noodles look like and they came out
pretty<00:03:03.390> good<00:03:04.390> I<00:03:04.690> might<00:03:05.290> I<00:03:05.470> could<00:03:05.680> have

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
pretty good I might I could have

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:06.990 
pretty good I might I could have
probably<00:03:05.860> left<00:03:06.220> it<00:03:06.340> in<00:03:06.430> a<00:03:06.489> little<00:03:06.760> bit<00:03:06.880> longer

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
probably left it in a little bit longer

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.900 
probably left it in a little bit longer
but<00:03:07.390> for<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:07.600> most<00:03:07.750> part<00:03:08.310> this<00:03:09.310> is<00:03:09.370> this<00:03:09.730> is<00:03:09.880> a

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
but for the most part this is this is a

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.580 
but for the most part this is this is a
good<00:03:11.370> I<00:03:12.370> guess<00:03:13.269> they're<00:03:13.870> they're<00:03:14.350> done

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
good I guess they're they're done

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.400 
good I guess they're they're done
they're<00:03:15.070> good<00:03:15.299> all<00:03:16.299> right<00:03:16.390> so<00:03:16.660> I'm<00:03:17.110> gonna<00:03:17.200> put

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
they're good all right so I'm gonna put

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:25.259 
they're good all right so I'm gonna put
the<00:03:17.560> chicken<00:03:18.250> seasoning<00:03:18.730> in<00:03:23.549> there<00:03:24.549> we<00:03:24.730> go<00:03:24.910> now

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
the chicken seasoning in there we go now

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.590 
the chicken seasoning in there we go now
I'm<00:03:25.360> gonna<00:03:25.480> mix<00:03:25.720> it<00:03:25.930> up<00:03:27.330> and<00:03:28.330> you're<00:03:28.450> probably

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
I'm gonna mix it up and you're probably

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.120 
I'm gonna mix it up and you're probably
gonna<00:03:28.810> want<00:03:29.110> to<00:03:29.170> let<00:03:29.260> this<00:03:29.410> sit<00:03:29.709> a<00:03:29.739> little<00:03:29.890> bit

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
gonna want to let this sit a little bit

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.770 
gonna want to let this sit a little bit
just<00:03:30.519> so<00:03:30.580> it<00:03:30.730> cooks<00:03:30.880> maybe<00:03:31.209> a<00:03:31.239> little<00:03:31.390> bit<00:03:31.570> more

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
just so it cooks maybe a little bit more

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.470 
just so it cooks maybe a little bit more
I<00:03:32.049> mean<00:03:32.830> the<00:03:33.010> seasoning<00:03:33.820> soaks<00:03:34.090> through<00:03:34.209> the

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
I mean the seasoning soaks through the

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:42.400 
I mean the seasoning soaks through the
noodles

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.380 

but<00:03:43.410> that's<00:03:43.650> your<00:03:43.860> final<00:03:44.220> product<00:03:44.520> I'm<00:03:45.180> going

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
but that's your final product I'm going

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.100 
but that's your final product I'm going
to<00:03:45.860> test<00:03:46.860> it<00:03:47.070> out<00:03:47.160> see<00:03:47.220> if<00:03:47.520> the<00:03:47.850> plastic<00:03:48.630> gives

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
to test it out see if the plastic gives

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.800 
to test it out see if the plastic gives
the<00:03:49.200> noodles<00:03:49.500> any<00:03:49.650> flavor<00:03:50.240> all<00:03:51.240> right

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
the noodles any flavor all right

00:03:51.810 --> 00:04:05.240 
the noodles any flavor all right
here<00:03:52.170> we<00:03:52.290> go

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.150 

I<00:04:05.370> definitely<00:04:06.030> could<00:04:06.330> have<00:04:06.450> my<00:04:07.080> microwaves<00:04:08.130> I

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
I definitely could have my microwaves I

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.130 
I definitely could have my microwaves I
think<00:04:08.790> it's<00:04:08.880> low<00:04:09.090> wattage<00:04:09.330> so<00:04:09.750> it<00:04:09.840> doesn't

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
think it's low wattage so it doesn't

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.560 
think it's low wattage so it doesn't
really<00:04:10.260> cook<00:04:10.500> that<00:04:11.430> fast<00:04:11.790> I<00:04:12.030> probably<00:04:12.360> could

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
really cook that fast I probably could

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.350 
really cook that fast I probably could
have<00:04:12.600> left<00:04:12.780> it<00:04:12.870> a<00:04:13.020> little<00:04:13.260> bit<00:04:13.380> longer<00:04:14.360> maybe

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
have left it a little bit longer maybe

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:25.100 
have left it a little bit longer maybe
like<00:04:15.570> 30<00:04:15.810> seconds<00:04:21.530> right<00:04:22.530> I<00:04:23.690> don't<00:04:24.690> taste<00:04:24.840> any

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
like 30 seconds right I don't taste any

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.130 
like 30 seconds right I don't taste any
plastic<00:04:25.590> flavor<00:04:25.800> noodles<00:04:26.610> taste<00:04:26.820> great

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
plastic flavor noodles taste great

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.960 
plastic flavor noodles taste great
tastes<00:04:28.140> almost<00:04:28.950> exactly<00:04:29.310> like<00:04:29.460> it<00:04:29.640> does<00:04:29.820> on

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
tastes almost exactly like it does on

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.200 
tastes almost exactly like it does on
this<00:04:30.120> you<00:04:30.450> know<00:04:30.510> cooking<00:04:30.750> it<00:04:30.870> on<00:04:30.900> the<00:04:31.080> stovetop

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
this you know cooking it on the stovetop

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.440 
this you know cooking it on the stovetop
so<00:04:33.210> do<00:04:33.450> I<00:04:33.480> recommend<00:04:33.960> the<00:04:34.050> rapid<00:04:34.410> ramen<00:04:34.620> cooker

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450

I<00:04:36.590> think<00:04:37.590> you<00:04:37.680> should<00:04:37.860> save<00:04:38.040> your<00:04:38.190> money<00:04:38.340> I

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
I think you should save your money I

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.770 
I think you should save your money I
think<00:04:38.550> this<00:04:38.850> is<00:04:38.940> a<00:04:39.000> little<00:04:39.210> bit<00:04:39.330> overpriced

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
think this is a little bit overpriced

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.220 
think this is a little bit overpriced
for<00:04:40.230> what<00:04:40.290> it<00:04:40.650> does<00:04:40.860> it's<00:04:41.100> almost<00:04:41.370> ten<00:04:41.610> dollars

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
for what it does it's almost ten dollars

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.870 
for what it does it's almost ten dollars
all<00:04:43.230> it<00:04:43.440> is<00:04:43.560> is<00:04:43.740> a<00:04:43.770> plastic<00:04:44.280> bowl<00:04:44.490> you<00:04:44.669> could<00:04:44.790> to

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
all it is is a plastic bowl you could to

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.390 
all it is is a plastic bowl you could to
easily<00:04:45.270> use<00:04:45.330> a<00:04:45.600> ceramic<00:04:45.990> bowl<00:04:46.350> you<00:04:46.950> know<00:04:46.980> go<00:04:47.340> to

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
easily use a ceramic bowl you know go to

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.600 
easily use a ceramic bowl you know go to
your<00:04:51.020> uses<00:04:52.020> so<00:04:52.919> maybe<00:04:53.100> get<00:04:53.340> you<00:04:53.490> know<00:04:53.580> a

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
your uses so maybe get you know a

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.580 
your uses so maybe get you know a
Corning<00:04:54.000> ware<00:04:54.030> bowl<00:04:54.390> you<00:04:55.140> can<00:04:55.260> put<00:04:55.350> these<00:04:55.470> in

the<00:04:55.650> microwave<00:04:58.610> I<00:04:59.610> think<00:05:00.510> it's<00:05:00.600> a<00:05:00.660> little

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
the microwave I think it's a little

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.840 
the microwave I think it's a little
overpriced<00:05:01.230> for<00:05:01.440> just<00:05:01.590> a<00:05:01.650> plastic<00:05:01.830> bowl<00:05:02.190> maybe

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
overpriced for just a plastic bowl maybe

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.460 
overpriced for just a plastic bowl maybe
if<00:05:03.000> you<00:05:03.060> find<00:05:03.210> it<00:05:03.360> at<00:05:03.450> a<00:05:03.510> dollar<00:05:03.720> store<00:05:03.810> and<00:05:04.110> you
