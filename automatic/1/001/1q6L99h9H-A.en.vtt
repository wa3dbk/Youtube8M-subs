00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
for two reasons first as I mentioned

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.240 
for two reasons first as I mentioned
before<00:03:12.720> it's<00:03:13.319> the<00:03:13.380> most<00:03:13.560> expensive<00:03:13.860> Aussie

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
thousand dollars plus on-road costs so

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.170 
thousand dollars plus on-road costs so
you<00:03:19.860> could<00:03:20.099> be<00:03:20.190> saving<00:03:20.549> for<00:03:20.579> a<00:03:20.730> while<00:03:20.910> or<00:03:21.120> at

you could be saving for a while or at

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
least I would be and the other reason

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.729 
least I would be and the other reason
you<00:03:23.519> can<00:03:23.700> have<00:03:23.790> to<00:03:23.880> be<00:03:23.910> patient<00:03:24.420> it's<00:03:25.410> because

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
you can have to be patient it's because

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.470 
you can have to be patient it's because
they<00:03:25.829> can<00:03:25.980> only<00:03:26.130> build<00:03:26.459> about<00:03:26.849> half<00:03:27.150> a<00:03:27.299> dozen
