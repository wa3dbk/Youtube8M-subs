00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.980
 this weekend has been the theater 

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:06.390
 their disillusion last year no trace 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.940
 of time if we appear on the face 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.500
 Saracens that of Clermont 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.120
 shows a whole other aspect mixing 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.410
 impatience and determination before 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.890
 to enter a third semifinal 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.970
 European in a row 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.650
 passed the excitement of the first 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.600
 moments and the observation period at the 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.430
 foot the saracens decides to hold the 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.320
 balloon the defense of clermont undergoes the 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.320
 speed of execution of Londoners 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.270
 here are the first sequences in 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.220
 the saracens with you or poulard yes we 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.420
 chose not to use the foot 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.640
 because we were close to the area 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.350
 50 meters sailing and its contours 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.120
 interiors it is well done the first 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.980
 person activates the first try for 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.340
 the saracens at the first trials signed 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.440
 ashton the international winger 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.910
 hit a big shot again 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.130
 by signing his tenth European essay 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.860
 this season after eight minutes the 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.450
 saracens leads 7 to 0 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.180
 the reaction of clermont is shy 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.430
 morden not reduced the gap on penalty 3 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.530
 minutes later when this occurs 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.070
 which a posteriori appears as the 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.070
 turning point of the match 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.240
 lee byrne clearance is countered 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:18.850
 marcelo bosch followed and climbed the ball 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.920
 like brock james 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.330
 nigel owens uses video for 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.220
 to know if the Australian has voluntarily 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:29.080
 pulled the ball out of the play air according to 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.270
 him on slows down the answer is yes 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.150
 and the penalty falls like a blow from 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.550
 club on the heads of Clermont 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.880
 yellow card for brock james and his 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.880
 two penalties 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.250
 I think it was involuntary 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.560
 the action of james brock so a cardboard 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.440
 plus a penalty try what I 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.330
 found during 14 to 3 the saracens were 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.100
 paradoxically clearly detach 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.320
 numerical inferiority show themselves more 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.930
 enterprising exact share for sivivatu 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.509
 who spreads for stanley the replica 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.690
 auvergnate is smashing on the new 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.580
 sir owens whistle 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:12.340
 empty passage of damien chouly and that's 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.530
 logically refused yet clearly 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.790
 dominate territorially but lack of 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.680
 realize their strong moments 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.000
 men of vern cotter air must be 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.739
 settle for crumbs like this 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.050
 parra penalty which reduces the gap to 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.580
 14 to 6 crumbs in the saracens 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.290
 make their honey ten minutes from the 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.660
 half-time attacks to clearly ascend 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.209
 ultrafast balloons scraped ground turn 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.380
 over is behind realism domains 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.940
 headlights wings hatchback voices the most rare 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.620
 to the burger that came again on a 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.480
 plowing by diving with the several 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:47.110
 attacks fighting with maybe the 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:48.430
 forgotten sands is born knows that says that 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.320
 said mister owens had asked 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.610
 video arbitration 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.140
 and for the third time indeed 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.760
 the Welsh referee uses the video 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.190
 to find out if farrell is committing a 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.680
 forward in slow motion it's his knee 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.799
 who propels the ball ahead so not 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.820
 of a first and third English test 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:08.650
 validated but looking closer 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.959
 the video referees could have also 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.299
 wonder about the pass between GoudÃ© and 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.430
 ashton at the beginning of the action 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:17.410
 nothing to report according to him and end of a 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.030
 first nightmare period for clermont 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.030
 conducted 24 to 6 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.970
 we played we played jerkily both 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.030
 three highlights that we have not branded 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.470
 we take counters just behind 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.860
 we helped it a little bit a little bit 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.300
 con on defense mistakes also hu 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.670
 did far too many mistakes hours 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.050
 with 18 points behind the end of the 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.210
 encounter is no longer in doubt 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.710
 dominated in aggression beaten in the 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.910
 battle of the airs overtaken by the 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.620
 English speed 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.810
 the people of Clermont are exhausted in clogging 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.520
 breaches of poke that we put forward 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.770
 a few meters from the line 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.720
 the danger is permanent and by dint of 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:58.140
 bang on a wall red and black clermont 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.670
 get punished with if it goes all who 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.989
 can forward to stanley 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.959
 the acceleration of this stage there and back 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.970
 inside for you talk to the little palace 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.890
 the ball repelled from the foot now 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.380
 by ashton you'll perhaps recovers 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.690
 and pushed thousands of buyers and a 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.420
 double ashton who sends the saracens 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.160
 is safe now at the cup finals 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.720
 europe 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.669
 ashton brings to eleven its number of tests 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.880
 registered h cup this season again 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:25.260
 record fn of Clermont's illusions have 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.820
 been put in a position we had to all 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.750
 played everything play against a team that 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.520
 defends very well that puts a lot 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.229
 of physical intensity like that it was 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.210
 it's transformed a little bit 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.800
 what about the end 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.930
 the end of the match is almost anecdotal 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.150
 she turns to Calvary for clermont 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.250
 resigned to the image of cudmore stunned 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.530
 by so much helplessness illustrated by this 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.690
 lost ball in touch that leads to the 5th 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:49.919
 English try to sign chris weitz with a 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:52.560
 young cadet who can lengthen his pass 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:55.860
 now we are far from 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:59.340
 heritage and that's for the test of 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.990
 wilde who had just returned 39 to 6 the 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.880
 points scroll like so many shots of 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.259
 knocked on the finalists 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.880
 from last year 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:07.560
 team twizzers complete the triumph 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.460
 English with a 6th synonymous test 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.229
 humiliation 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.229
 almost too big to be true 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:21.630
 ten meters was outnumbered it 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:25.080
 for good beauty processor the new 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.970
 try and that's the sister wish the 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.410
 little boys do not mark mccall swept he 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.810
 two years ago quarter-finals have well 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.030
 grew up and took a dazzling revenge 46 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.590
 at 6 final score the saracens get 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.580
 qualify for the first final of 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.170
 their story 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.060
 clearly he will not raise this 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.840
 again year the continental title 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.310
 supreme 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.540
 no more than vern cotter era in 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:46.130
 european history with asm 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.130
 ends in twickenham
