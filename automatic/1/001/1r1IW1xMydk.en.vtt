I<00:01:08.610> like<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.720> endoscopic<00:01:10.080> forehead<00:01:10.530> technique

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
I like the endoscopic forehead technique

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.850 
I like the endoscopic forehead technique
because<00:01:11.790> it's<00:01:12.150> minimally<00:01:12.510> invasive<00:01:13.140> the

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
because it's minimally invasive the

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.160 
because it's minimally invasive the
incisions<00:01:14.369> are<00:01:14.520> well<00:01:14.729> hidden<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:15.270> the

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170

hairline and there's no large removal of
skin<00:01:19.280> scarring<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.400> usually<00:01:20.640> very<00:01:20.820> minimal

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
skin scarring is usually very minimal

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.140
