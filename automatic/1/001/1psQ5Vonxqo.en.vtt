00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.000
 ah 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.349
 because this master of emotional ecology 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:22.029
 we are aware that in certain 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.910
 moment of our life is important 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:27.099
 that we choose to conform for every problem 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.770
 or be part of the ecology solution 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:32.010
 emotional proposes to be part of this 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:35.010
 solution that we have to build 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.010
 jointly 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.620
 Well, the master the truth is that I 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.960
 has contributed a lot more than 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.750
 that can imagine me on the one hand gives you 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:51.100
 tools gives you resources and on the other 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:53.290
 discover you in resources and things that you 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.900
 you have but maybe you did not have 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.830
 sufficiently identified ecology 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:02.600
 emotional has given me a little bit of those 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:05.479
 strategies that I 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.320
 who support me in difficult times 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.290
 what happens 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.620
 when I started this master I was already 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:17.460
 living a moment let's say stormy 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:21.540
 of my life and being able to explore in that 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:25.020
 instant then in what climates I myself 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.670
 I moved to be able to introduce myself with these 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.009
 precious metaphors with which 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.520
 work in the emotional ecology has 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.930
 given then a new awareness 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.180
 for me the emotional ecology and the 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.780
 Master has been a radical change of life 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.430
 a radical change of approach another way 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.060
 of doing things another way of 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:48.110
 manage my relationships of how I perceive 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.110
 and I live things 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:55.650
 this master has basically two axes 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:57.540
 important objectives on the one hand the 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.610
 own growth of the professional who 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.960
 participates in it during these two years 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:06.780
 this person is going to live is going to explore 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.750
 your own inner territories is going to 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.570
 update your resources the second year 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:16.890
 is going to do a job already 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:18.870
 co-creation embodiment of designs 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.300
 materials so that each of the 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.690
 professionals whatever the system in 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.910
 who participates can create something that 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.030
 improve 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:33.020
 I would recommend the ecology master 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.710
 emotional especially for the experiential 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.280
 What is it 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:40.350
 for the human group that gathers here 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.880
 the companions and all the experiences 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:48.600
 They are very seers very stimulate 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:52.530
 the senses and I think when you work 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:55.709
 with the senses the five senses 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.360
 wake up to the sixth and everything 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.430
 you learn through the senses you 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.510
 it is engraved in the heart not really 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.470
 the master has a practical application 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:09.150
 amazing 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:12.260
 in all areas of life and issues 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.720
 of couple family themes 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.819
 small blockages or problems 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.700
 emotional that there may be in a field 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:23.360
 labor that through the tools 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.870
 acquired and discovered I felt that already 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.819
 you had that whole emotional ecology 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.849
 you can solve much more 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:34.010
 simple what it may look like 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:37.819
 problem or any emotional conflict 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:41.260
 that's a different form in a way 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:45.950
 under my point of view that envelops you 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:48.500
 that you manage to make of it as part of 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.230
 your day to day you can not transmit it or 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.440
 be the changes that are in you are going the 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.049
 Domino effect is coming up with your 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.450
 family with your friends in your work to 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:01.459
 I personally have brought me some 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.260
 very powerful tools when it comes to 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.329
 working with people opens up a 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.220
 huge world of possibilities from a 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:08.959
 huge world of possibilities working 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.750
 through metaphors through 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:13.700
 through dynamic stories that you 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.729
 incorporating your life and your management of 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.109
 life little by little almost without realizing 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:21.049
 through work in the 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:24.080
 from that practical part that you 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.030
 it puts our hands in the dough ' 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.219
 really live things live 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.129
 accent your flesh with your group with your 

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:33.889
 people is a tremendously approach 

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:36.469
 positive of life is to live life 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:39.680
 from its positive side and from the 

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:42.050
 pretty management of everything that surrounds us 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.879
 you who want to be part of the solution 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.120
 not part of the problem you want 

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:49.719
 solutions for that what you do not need 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.719
 the solutions
