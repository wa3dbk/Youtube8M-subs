00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.510
 that the switch channel is one of the 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.940
 main shipping lanes of the world 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.910
 if you have 50 percent of the total 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.800
 Freight volume is transferred here 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.109
 it is especially important to do it 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.270
 for the height supply in europe because 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.970
 many parents were here through the canal 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.500
 and therefore not all the way around 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.810
 driving around africa 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.640
 We are now also in the channel in one 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.410
 check with us behind many 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.180
 ships helicopter duty the 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.370
 statements and controlled to know 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.370
 that happen and that we go through 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.930
 That costs about $ 170,000 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.620
 It goes 192 km through this channel 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.660
 between 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.660
 also past two big lakes 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.769
 this is the biggest lake on the way here 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.320
 through the suez canal the big peter lake 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:01.019
 and during the last Egyptian 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.989
 Israeli wars sat their ships 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:06.180
 stuck for over eight years and the 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.840
 Crew had to live it somehow 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.800
 receive 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.600
 So that was a big deal 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:16.790
 Oberholz day is the scandal of course 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.790
 open again for all ships 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.280
 and now the convoy of the 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.370
 north comes here in the beta lake that comes 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.430
 from the mediterranean sea and ship from the red 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:44.340
 Sea out and share the route 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.100
 can he traveled on one side only so 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.930
 but here in the bitter, on the other hand, is the 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.930
 two convoys past each other 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.900
 we have more than half of the canal 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.380
 already happened and it's easy 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.990
 an indescribable scenery here on 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.500
 the waterway in the middle of the desert 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.500
 drive 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.989
 right and left are now always 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.950
 again small dwellings are straight 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.549
 We also passed a city 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.409
 come 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.680
 So here really changes 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:54.879
 a lot, and I watch you once the 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.370
 three-parting of the colors above that 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:03:04.019
 light blue sky below the turquoise blue 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:04.019
 water know how to paint 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.710
 because the opposite lane at this point 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.600
 Here it is covered by the desert 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.250
 look like a ship in the 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.870
 desert is but it is natural 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.420
 Nevertheless , he sees the open water man 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.900
 corporations are on it so long lies 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.900
 not there 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:04.730
 can use 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:08.819
 haase now we have reached by 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:12.319
 and thus msv stands out in the Mediterranean 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.319
 we are looking forward to the last ones
