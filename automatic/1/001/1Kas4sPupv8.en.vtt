overclock your phone I've got two
overclocked<00:00:29.369> about<00:00:29.640> 1.9<00:00:30.269> 98<00:00:30.869> just<00:00:31.349> slightly

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
overclocked about 1.9 98 just slightly

overclocked about 1.9 98 just slightly
you<00:00:32.910> can<00:00:33.059> overclock<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.510> up<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.899> two<00:00:34.050> point

you can overclock it up to two point
three<00:00:34.469> gigahertz<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.399> don't<00:00:35.610> actually

three gigahertz I don't actually

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.700 
three gigahertz I don't actually
recommend<00:00:36.090> overclocking<00:00:36.960> for<00:00:37.140> most<00:00:37.350> people

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
recommend overclocking for most people

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.400 
recommend overclocking for most people
only<00:00:38.640> for<00:00:38.940> those<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.300> who<00:00:39.510> want<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.840> really

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
only for those of you who want to really

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.290 
only for those of you who want to really
test<00:00:40.710> out<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.160> performance<00:00:41.760> on<00:00:41.910> your<00:00:42.090> phone

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
test out the performance on your phone

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.930 
test out the performance on your phone
or<00:00:42.540> maybe<00:00:42.809> playing<00:00:43.110> HD<00:00:43.530> games<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.040> also<00:00:44.789> you

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
or maybe playing HD games and also you

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.029 
or maybe playing HD games and also you
can<00:00:45.239> even<00:00:45.450> under<00:00:45.989> clock<00:00:46.289> basically

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
can even under clock basically

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.190 
can even under clock basically
underclocking<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.850> just<00:00:48.120> kind<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.420> putting

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
underclocking is just kind of putting

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.670 
underclocking is just kind of putting
slightly<00:00:50.070> less<00:00:50.430> voltage<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.510> each<00:00:51.930> steps<00:00:52.350> here

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
slightly less voltage to each steps here

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.549 
slightly less voltage to each steps here
you<00:00:53.250> can<00:00:53.370> play<00:00:53.520> with<00:00:53.699> this<00:00:53.940> um<00:00:54.300> don't<00:00:54.570> turn<00:00:55.410> it

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
you can play with this um don't turn it

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.939 
you can play with this um don't turn it
down<00:00:55.680> too<00:00:56.039> much<00:00:56.449> just<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:58.410> know<00:00:58.440> tweak<00:00:58.770> a

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
down too much just you know tweak a

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.770 
down too much just you know tweak a
little<00:00:58.980> bit<00:00:59.340> at<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.489> time<00:00:59.609> until<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.480> can<00:01:00.629> find

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
little bit at a time until you can find

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.740 
little bit at a time until you can find
a<00:01:00.960> stable<00:01:01.609> undervolting<00:01:02.609> which<00:01:03.030> can<00:01:03.300> save<00:01:03.570> you

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
a stable undervolting which can save you

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.230 
a stable undervolting which can save you
a<00:01:03.780> lot<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.140> battery<00:01:04.530> life<00:01:04.799> so<00:01:05.430> that's<00:01:05.850> about<00:01:06.210> it

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
a lot of battery life so that's about it

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.859 
a lot of battery life so that's about it
for<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:07.110> kernel<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:08.540> also<00:01:09.590> you<00:01:10.590> will<00:01:10.770> find

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
for the kernel and also you will find

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.840 
for the kernel and also you will find
hotspot<00:01:12.869> working<00:01:13.350> out<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.770> box<00:01:14.070> Wi-Fi

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
hotspot working out of the box Wi-Fi

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.520 
hotspot working out of the box Wi-Fi
tether<00:01:15.119> working<00:01:15.509> out<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.720> box<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.500> you

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
tether working out of the box so you

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.640 
tether working out of the box so you
will<00:01:17.040> not<00:01:17.250> get<00:01:17.909> some<00:01:18.720> weird<00:01:19.020> Sprint's

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
will not get some weird Sprint's

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.070 
will not get some weird Sprint's
annoying<00:01:20.130> messages<00:01:20.310> I'm<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:21.930> nice

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
slightly green there and a nice battery

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.660 
slightly green there and a nice battery
bar<00:01:27.509> there<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.990> lot<00:01:28.590> probably<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.340> coolest

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
bar there a lot probably the coolest

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
part on this rom is basically the

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.420 
part on this rom is basically the
transmission<00:01:33.390> animations<00:01:34.110> you'll<00:01:35.040> see<00:01:35.250> that

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
transmission animations you'll see that

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.190 
transmission animations you'll see that
it's<00:01:35.909> nicely<00:01:37.400> transitioning<00:01:38.780> also<00:01:39.780> when<00:01:40.110> you

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
it's nicely transitioning also when you

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.469 
it's nicely transitioning also when you
open<00:01:40.470> up<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.680> browser<00:01:40.979> there's<00:01:41.670> just<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:42.119> ton

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
open up the browser there's just a ton

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.499 
open up the browser there's just a ton
of<00:01:42.540> transition<00:01:43.380> animations<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.659> makes<00:01:45.659> this

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
of transition animations that makes this

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.090 
of transition animations that makes this
problem<00:01:48.509> really<00:01:48.750> cool<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.259> my<00:01:49.320> opinion<00:01:49.560> and

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
problem really cool in my opinion and

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.950 
problem really cool in my opinion and
also<00:01:50.790> uh<00:01:50.820> for<00:01:51.630> for<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.920> icons<00:01:53.399> this<00:01:54.360> rom<00:01:54.659> does

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
also uh for for the icons this rom does

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.399 
also uh for for the icons this rom does
display<00:01:55.320> 1x<00:01:55.979> RTT<00:01:56.610> true<00:01:57.180> 1x<00:01:57.479> RTT<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.200> if<00:01:58.290> you

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
display 1x RTT true 1x RTT so if you

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.200 
display 1x RTT true 1x RTT so if you
actually<00:01:58.590> drop<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.070> 1x<00:01:59.310> RTT<00:01:59.729> i'll<00:01:59.939> show<00:02:00.149> you

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
actually drop to 1x RTT i'll show you

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.980 
actually drop to 1x RTT i'll show you
one<00:02:00.450> x<00:02:00.600> RTT<00:02:01.110> instead<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.560> just<00:02:02.430> 3g<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.719> also

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
one x RTT instead of just 3g and also

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.389 
one x RTT instead of just 3g and also
this<00:02:04.170> rom<00:02:04.380> does<00:02:04.710> have<00:02:05.070> native<00:02:05.790> ad<00:02:06.719> ad<00:02:07.399> blocking

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
this rom does have native ad ad blocking

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.059 
this rom does have native ad ad blocking
so<00:02:09.030> you'll<00:02:09.239> not<00:02:09.450> find<00:02:09.780> any<00:02:10.110> ads<00:02:10.349> on<00:02:10.619> this<00:02:10.860> run

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069
