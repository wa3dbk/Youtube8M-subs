00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.010
 Fuel cell heaters are an attractive option for energy 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.680
 supply in the house Germany is a pioneer in this environmentally friendly 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.579
 future technologies 

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:21.029
 Metalurgs the practice test fuel cells for the home at the 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.469
 leading energy supply companies 

00:00:23.469 --> 00:00:27.529
 Device manufacturers and the Federal Ministry of Transport Construction and 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.109
 Urban development as part of the National Innovation Program 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.170
 hydrogen and fuel cell technology 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.290
 for an early launch of fuel cell heaters 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.670
 we have one here 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.090
 the temperature 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.980
 fuel cell 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.460
 in the 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.620
 To lead natural gas 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.850
 and then in conjunction with air 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.930
 the Finnish will only go into operation from now on with this 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.739
 Technology is obvious 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.880
 Homeowner the drilling company 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.880
 The advantage of the fuel cell is of course quite clear 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.620
 No, because I only generate heat or so electricity is generated 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.080
 and so that morning 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.450
 to use this fuel effectively for a confident 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.049
 in the context of decentralized power generation 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.499
 can the otherwise unused lost waste heat directly for heating purposes in the 

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:24.619
 Residential house should be used homeowner Winfried Dreger 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.930
 Problem solving does not continue what is now in the ejection 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.930
 then, above all, the savings 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.310
 On the electricity should be through self-generation and so does the practice 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.160
 out 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.310
 As usual, the heating engineer becomes the customer and also the conditions 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.310
 check and expand the outdated tiger 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.620
 the installation of the fuel cell heaters Stay 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.420
 sometimes takes less space than the previous heating system 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.030
 on 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.920
 Stefan Müller responsible for the technical implementation of the project at the 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.940
 you device during installation there is no challenge 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.940
 the press office is building on existing ones again 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.850
 a fixed price has been added "Crystal" and then it will be about 20 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:11.969
 year old 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:15.280
 A fuel cell vehicle of the world is being installed 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:17.829
 uses highly efficient natural gas 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:19.499
 and Google Chrome 

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:22.899
 at different locations in Germany will be part of the 

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:26.369
 Project Canucks fuel cell heaters installed 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.930
 while the homeowners have to install the new technology 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.259
 will not give up any comfort 

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:35.849
 Homeowner and a third 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.689
 as they wished the device reliably so wants to judge 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:43.369
 I have Mastercard all the time and if not like Hans 

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:47.329
 Homeowners repeatedly looked down end energy counter what feeds here 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:52.189
 19 that the system should feed power again without disturbance can still come 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:54.680
 the devices are currently running in the field test 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.499
 are still prototypes 

00:02:56.499 --> 00:03:00.919
 Michael Hölz ​​and others responsible for the plant in the district of Karlsruhe 

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:04.049
 Annual catalog process in Gothenburg 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.379
 if it's about three to four times a year we do not want it that way 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.219
 were for example lead for the Porsche photo Christel 

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:13.679
 horse-life 

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:15.260
 that's what Canucks stands for 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.530
 the practical test of fuel cells for the home next to the technical 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.970
 Developing especially the experience in practice 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.209
 Continuous operation 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.569
 the prospects are good 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.969
 Because the devices are now even clearer even more compact in the future 

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:30.549
 become 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.189
 A fascinating technique is foreseen here 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:36.939
 Concrete talk Percent with the Viennese lines are also in the 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:38.849
 generate electrical energy 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.139
 and in my opinion, this is actually the GI picture and the technique of the train 

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:47.749
 So fuel cell heaters will make an important contribution in the 

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:50.169
 To provide the energy supply of the future 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:54.879
 Canucks is involved in the fuel cell test for Strigel 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:55.340
 to have
