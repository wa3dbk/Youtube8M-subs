00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
uh map is made completely of all curves

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:32.800 
uh map is made completely of all curves
like<00:01:30.080> I<00:01:30.200> said<00:01:30.380> earlier<00:01:31.330> Sparky<00:01:32.330> is<00:01:32.450> indeed

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
anyway obviously the map is uh called

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.400 
anyway obviously the map is uh called
Montana's<00:01:59.090> mountain<00:01:59.420> because<00:01:59.989> it's<00:02:00.170> based

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
Montana's mountain because it's based

can<00:02:08.209> go<00:02:08.330> over<00:02:08.569> the<00:02:09.080> map<00:02:09.259> is<00:02:09.500> long<00:02:09.860> as<00:02:10.069> hell<00:02:10.099> it's

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
can go over the map is long as hell it's

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.490 
can go over the map is long as hell it's
a<00:02:10.520> two-minute<00:02:11.000> lap<00:02:11.300> time<00:02:11.599> if<00:02:11.810> you<00:02:11.930> do<00:02:12.050> not<00:02:12.200> die

a two-minute lap time if you do not die

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.300 
a two-minute lap time if you do not die
once<00:02:12.970> so<00:02:13.970> it's<00:02:14.390> it's<00:02:14.780> not<00:02:15.020> sure<00:02:15.379> I<00:02:15.680> definitely

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
once so it's it's not sure I definitely

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.339 
once so it's it's not sure I definitely
have<00:02:16.580> a<00:02:16.610> lab<00:02:16.879> length<00:02:17.120> and<00:02:17.360> if<00:02:17.629> you're<00:02:17.810> not<00:02:18.319> a

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
have a lab length and if you're not a

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:19.780 
have a lab length and if you're not a
retard<00:02:18.650> you<00:02:19.010> to<00:02:19.129> realize<00:02:19.400> that<00:02:19.430> I<00:02:19.670> actually

use a wall mod here I've ever heard the

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.770 
use a wall mod here I've ever heard the
saying<00:02:22.760> you<00:02:22.910> know<00:02:23.060> if<00:02:23.180> you<00:02:23.270> can't<00:02:23.510> beat<00:02:23.750> them

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
saying you know if you can't beat them

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.420 
saying you know if you can't beat them
join<00:02:23.870> them<00:02:24.230> that's<00:02:24.590> kind<00:02:24.830> of<00:02:24.860> what<00:02:25.010> I'm<00:02:25.160> doing

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
join them that's kind of what I'm doing

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.850 
join them that's kind of what I'm doing
right<00:02:25.610> now<00:02:25.790> I<00:02:26.060> think<00:02:26.930> this<00:02:27.020> map<00:02:27.230> I'm<00:02:27.530> trying<00:02:27.739> to

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
right now I think this map I'm trying to

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.619 
right now I think this map I'm trying to
get<00:02:27.950> this<00:02:28.010> map<00:02:28.250> oh<00:02:28.459> look<00:02:28.730> at<00:02:28.849> that<00:02:28.879> this<00:02:29.450> is

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:29.629 
get this map oh look at that this is

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:31.300 
get this map oh look at that this is
