00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:41.719 
on her sixth set point what was really

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:44.499 
on her sixth set point what was really
impressive<00:01:42.140> was<00:01:42.649> that<00:01:42.939> panetta<00:01:43.939> played<00:01:44.240> great

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
impressive was that panetta played great

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.200 
impressive was that panetta played great
tennis<00:01:44.929> in<00:01:45.079> that<00:01:45.229> game<00:01:45.469> but<00:01:46.069> Azarenka<00:01:46.340> kept<00:01:47.030> on

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
tennis in that game but Azarenka kept on

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.899 
tennis in that game but Azarenka kept on
attacking<00:01:47.659> kept<00:01:48.439> on<00:01:48.590> storming<00:01:49.130> through<00:01:49.159> what

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
attacking kept on storming through what

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.719 
attacking kept on storming through what
I<00:01:49.939> think<00:01:50.329> is<00:01:50.630> really<00:01:51.500> critical<00:01:52.009> is<00:01:52.459> in<00:01:52.640> the

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
I think is really critical is in the

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.580 
I think is really critical is in the
final<00:01:53.149> that<00:01:53.299> she<00:01:53.509> play<00:01:53.689> that<00:01:53.869> same<00:01:54.140> exact

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
final that she play that same exact

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.340 
final that she play that same exact
style<00:01:54.860> and<00:01:55.189> be<00:01:55.610> very<00:01:55.850> attacking<00:01:56.329> yeah<00:01:57.020> Panetta
