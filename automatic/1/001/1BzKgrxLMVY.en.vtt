00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.940

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.010
 I'm getting so yes yesterday I bought a girl from my hand 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.400
 those books that I was looking for her for a long time 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.020
 which I really needed 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.809
 harry potter and the philosopher's stone 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.239
 edition rosman who no one else has 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:44.150
 can not find any stores where 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.159
 just did not ask and literally everything 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.500

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:49.580

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.680
 friend's book 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:55.100
 and here there are a few differences from that 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.260
 the book 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.390

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.269
 green letters on the flyleaf phase 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.890
 and somehow she was by help it seems to me 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.170
 although the number of pages one and there 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.150
 same harry potter and secret room which 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.190
 I have also read and 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.420
 my edition is different from my edition 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.740
 friends only you kumi color letters on 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.230
 covers so i was afraid i 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.650
 confused but really different and 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:24.410
 the color of the pages that is the book is beautiful 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.120
 that's my book 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.100

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.490
 Dissatisfied that I now have my own 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.920
 harry potter harry potter and the prisoner 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.530
 Azkaban I already told you about him 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.020
 it is a gift and not for which she is huge 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.910
 thank you so much farther 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.130
 goblet of fire if I'm not mistaken and 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:51.650
 this girlâ€™s book has not survived therefore 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:53.750
 I bought 5 books from her no yes 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.940
 yes again books harry potter and order 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.070
 phoenix this book is brand new 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.220
 don't you think she's already ten years old 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:04.460
 much that book was changed in 2004 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.140
 year, the girl did not even read this book 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.850
 just put it on the shelf like it to me 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.409
 explained she was counting harry potter 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.739
 already in electronic format because 

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:15.470
 before i give money for books 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:18.530
 she gave me time to book every book 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:22.609
 checked and still very strong us that 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:25.370
 I do not like the quality is removed 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:27.319
 the safety of these books I give up their 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.609
 shopping I was shocked when she got 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.829
 books from the backpack because they 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:32.989
 really new really them 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:35.599
 no one you read me and by the way 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:38.060
 about and white I did not expect 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.249
 that the Order of the Phoenix can be like this 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.989
 chubby no it's me by no means 

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:45.079
 don't confuse it very well because 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.389
 when the philosopher's stone ended 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:49.400
 when finished with a secret room to me 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:50.989
 It was very sad because I 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.239
 it seems to be autumn now instead 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.689
 University, I would love to sit 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:59.989
 would read all this and read and read 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:03:02.239
 here already 800 pages in my 824 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:05.779
 page but I will not check but not the point 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:09.409
 I don't know how children read it, and for what 

00:03:05.779 --> 00:03:11.599
 this i 'm sure can fast enough 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:14.029
 be a week cutter or a half 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:16.010
 Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince 

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:17.989
 it feels like I bought this book 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.930
 in the store because really here 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.620
 it was conditionally removed from the shelf bought and not 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.079
 put 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.480
 principles constantly this happens it 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.950
 money is just awesome and 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.019
 I am her 1 reader 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.359
 and of course the deathly gifts which 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:35.419
 also brand new because nobody its 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:37.639
 I did not read and it was probably the second film 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:39.379
 harry potter which i looked at 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:40.730
 the movie screamed I watched the second part 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:43.370
 what shall we see now I stick 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.900
 the rule is that I read a book and then I look 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.740
 film so now i have to find 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.570
 only harry potter and the goblet of fire 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.390
 to put together a whole harry series 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.730
 potter if you have up the book she 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.670
 you don't need it in good condition then 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.650
 call me i will collect and also we 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.500
 sister went to the bookstore yesterday and 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:06.880
 she bought me a book as a gift 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.300
 from her to my birthday it is steven 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.720
 king 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.880
 pet cemetery I thought 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.470
 that it would probably be logical to start 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.660
 It is from this book because it seems like 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.940
 she's not very scary i'm not at all 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:22.090
 I know how I love you for him but rather 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.100
 I just think that I like her and 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.010
 Well if I like her because 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.170
 that much king i will have to read 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.910
 on study and there all I am very glad that you 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.190
 I support in no way 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.740
 you blame for having so much 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:39.340
 unread books and i honestly 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:42.070
 I was surprised when I heard that 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.860
 many shelves are no longer much 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.200
 read books well and if you 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.020
 like this video do not forget 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.460
 he is worth a thumbs up and comment 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.140
 now youtube is leading a new policy 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.720
 according to which if you can not 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:58.900
 show attention to the video only him 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.910
 watch these videos disappear 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.520
 from your subscriptions because youtube 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:07.930
 thinks you are not interested in watching them 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.670
 I would not want to part with you and I 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.010
 I appreciate you watching my video while doing so 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:15.630
 shop and read more often 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.630
 only good books yet
