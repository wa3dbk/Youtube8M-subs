00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:42.689 
read you know his mattress His Majesty
is<00:04:37.090> done<00:04:37.350> and<00:04:39.570> that<00:04:40.570> would<00:04:41.410> have<00:04:41.440> shown<00:04:42.310> us<00:04:42.490> if

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:42.699 
is done and that would have shown us if

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.150 
is done and that would have shown us if
when<00:04:43.120> I<00:04:43.479> still<00:04:44.229> believe<00:04:44.530> that<00:04:44.560> only<00:04:44.860> one

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
when I still believe that only one

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.250 
when I still believe that only one
medallion<00:04:45.490> can<00:04:45.970> hold<00:04:46.150> one<00:04:46.360> bankai<00:04:46.840> at<00:04:46.990> a<00:04:47.080> time

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
medallion can hold one bankai at a time

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.170 
medallion can hold one bankai at a time
so<00:04:47.500> that<00:04:47.530> would<00:04:47.740> admit<00:04:48.040> Mucha<00:04:48.729> lucha<00:04:48.760> would

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
so that would admit Mucha lucha would

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.320 
so that would admit Mucha lucha would
have<00:04:49.300> been<00:04:49.479> the<00:04:49.600> one<00:04:49.810> who<00:04:50.199> would<00:04:50.350> have<00:04:50.500> had<00:04:50.770> to

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
have been the one who would have had to

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.520 
have been the one who would have had to
still<00:04:52.330> renji's<00:04:52.870> bankai<00:04:53.470> but<00:04:54.250> I<00:04:55.229> like<00:04:56.229> seeing

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
still renji's bankai but I like seeing

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.920 
still renji's bankai but I like seeing
the<00:04:56.949> use<00:04:57.100> of<00:04:57.130> the<00:04:57.340> black<00:04:57.580> as<00:04:57.880> as<00:04:58.300> notice

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
the use of the black as as notice

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.469

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:06.270 

overall<00:05:04.479> though<00:05:04.720> that's<00:05:05.590> pretty<00:05:05.919> much<00:05:06.070> all

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
overall though that's pretty much all
