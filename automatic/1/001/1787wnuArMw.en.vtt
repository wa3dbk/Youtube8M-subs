00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:12.630
 okay 2014 is over and the games of this 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.650
 years were super interesting 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.300
 but they were normal so bad 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.949
 2014 in terms of video games was not so 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.750
 too awesome if you want 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.670
 feel a little better about 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.130
 last year is my time 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.160
 favorite video of the year is the top 5 on and 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.840
 the worst games of 2014 against which others 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:36.000
 look much better soul calibur 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.579
 possibly popular game and price for 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.920
 loyal fans but lasts for ps3 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.980
 unworthy title 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.660
 this franchise free play list play 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.879
 you can forgive because you do not need to spend 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.160
 not a single dollar to buy it but 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.199
 the presence of a heap of microtransactions which 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.059
 create a lasting sensation on and blunt and 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.730
 took care of this game 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.710
 turned out to be on this list except the opposite 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.750
 pay-to-win was still going to play 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.120
 since you need to buy an actionpay 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.860
 you to do quests on the other 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.710
 sides you can wait until the scale 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.479
 action points will fill itself with 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.450
 this huge problem in the game also 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.909
 there is a very long download 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.830
 yes there is still multiplayer 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.860
 absolutely not looking good 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.460
 one-on-one fighting game don't play it 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.350
 just do not need 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.659
 Well, since we have already started talking about games that 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.200
 the fifth honor of our childhood franchises 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.240
 here you are sonic boom raising lyric you 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.890
 probably remember my horrible video 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.050
 Sonic 2006 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.500
 and although this part is not so bad she 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.840
 still trying to reach his level 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.909
 disappointing shit nasty one of 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.020
 Our reviewers gave this game only 2 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.090
 out of 10 points 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.340
 because of bad fuckage broken 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.149
 chambers of repetitive levels boring 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.280
 battles and terrible responsiveness in general 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.649
 completely the opposite of what you can 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.660
 expect from the platformer what's not at all 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.340
 inspires him also called 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.890
 disgusting with a bunch of bugs and 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.380
 disgusting frame rate in general all 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.700
 what the game should do it the game does 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.019
 bad hell narva 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.180
 you know that almost never 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:17.489
 disappoints movie based games 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.680
 stop just the opposite and even in such 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:22.470
 top game rambo video game can cause 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.769
 you are special in my broken games i would 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.620
 said superman 64 flies but it doesn't 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:31.170
 fun well fish video game just make 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.060
 shooting in the game is uninteresting what in general 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.850
 can make a game for the indestructible 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.040
 killing machine awful sad one 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.510
 the fact that everything goes like this 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.400
 very conducive 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.590
 add to that terribly uncomfortable and 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.670
 relocation of sight and the absence of others 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.980
 lessons in the game 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.880
 here is this game for the light gun you 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.370
 you might think 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.780
 No, the game does not support any 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.430
 light guns 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.350
 remember bomberman classic game in 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.750
 the maze where you had to think a lot 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.120
 which brought us so much fun and 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.770
 became a classic so here is this game for sure 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.480
 the same is only bad in every sense 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.730
 basic game mechanics Crow for steelyard 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.110
 ps4 basically ok i probably 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.080
 because it is a bomberman 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.180
 well there is something else the game is trying 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.040
 be bent and horror and many 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.490
 the rest overnight and without 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.980
 achieves none of the above 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:26.990
 it's broken and unfinished and its place 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.480
 it is in the basement referred to in 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:32.450
 titles where it will never be 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.850
 play even developers blu bezers 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.680
 agreed that the game is bad and promised 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.650
 remake it and also do this 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.470
 crappy version with all additions 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:44.390
 free is probably the reason 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.620
 that you have not seen this game on 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:51.470
 conferences sony and so probably come 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.990
 time for air control you probably already 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.690
 heard about this beautiful game which 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.610
 stepped out of the incentive and instead 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.830
 tell you about her i started playing 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:25.060
 it's because on paper it seems 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:30.330
 good idea local arch like this 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.330
 and took on your stream 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.440
 he 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:49.349
 May 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.510

 tell me people what games are you 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:14.500
 consider them the worst of the worst 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.500
 this game from our list or something 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.180
 completely different 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.730
 translated and voiced by the team
