00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:06.019
 In 2006 the leading company in the production of tractors in China arrives 

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:09.879
 to Colombia to participate decisively in the agricultural industry 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:12.879
 from the country 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.189
 photon today has a wide line of tractors enough to supply 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:19.689
 all the needs of the agro industry 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:23.959
 with tractors ranging from 25 to 125 horsepower 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:27.560
 conditioned with proprietary technology engines 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.689
 the ballet du and transmissions make their ranges high 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.870
 these machines is presented as the perfect solution 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.580
 to the palm growers colombia 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.960
 buck 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.960
 as well 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.750
 but it really is ramón ayala the hut ac three years 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.390
 the foxconn tractors have seemed a very good machine 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.800
 for the work that they 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.800
 we demand here in the tasks of harvesting fruits 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.840
 it is quite heavy with the machines more resistant machines that 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.260
 truly for the state that is being demanded 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
 they are very good 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.790
 My name is Jorge Bayona 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.020
 the state of the hacienda the cabin for two years 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.290
 in the industrial responsible for the dinner part agricultural machinery in asilah the 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.290
 cane we started the mechanization about two years ago 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.380
 compared to traditional system we have standardized that - a tractor 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.510
 of 25 horses with its trailer capacity of 1500 kilos 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.450
 for three hundred hectares 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.090
 have given that is the criterion that is like saying that a tractor photo jm 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.060
 going around 20 euros 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.270
 and although the counselors have increased their performance their own times once 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.940
 we have also gone down from 20 harvesters to 12 15 harvesters at the time of year 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.930
 the deal was that we go through average 20 would affect the day is collected in times 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.659
 goes to container 15 and 7 tons 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:23.269
 at harvest time during the first semester despite the fact that it was one of the 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.269
 containers with more than 40 35 tons 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.879
 afp 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.990
 activity 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.970
 it's much better to have tractors like sticks 

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:51.739
 because it is easier to handle 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:58.989
 i can better program all the work for the palm producers that have 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.669
 more than 70 hectares vélez justifies having tractors 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:09.049
 because the initial investment for the harvest and maintenance part is 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:10.379
 much smaller 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:15.110
 but before we got into the photon brand we made certain 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.759
 tests for different brands 

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:22.589
 if we manage to have a bank of 10 thousand hours for the tractors 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:28.269
 i was determined that it is the best option for us both technical and 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:29.560
 economically 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.560
 It was the only one 

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:38.489
 Today has a presence in more than 15 cities of Colombia 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.489
 and technical support with nationwide coverage 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:46.620
 synonym of excellence and coverage attention and service 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.359
 If you are looking for a tractor, first look at a photon
