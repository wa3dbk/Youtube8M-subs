how<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.460> add<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:15.150> creative<00:00:16.020> tab<00:00:16.260> now<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:16.770> thought

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
how to add a creative tab now I thought

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.720 
how to add a creative tab now I thought
I<00:00:17.100> would<00:00:17.460> get<00:00:17.640> this<00:00:18.080> out<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.350> way<00:00:19.380> before<00:00:20.340> we

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
I would get this out the way before we

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.420 
I would get this out the way before we
actually<00:00:21.050> start<00:00:22.050> working<00:00:22.619> on<00:00:22.830> other<00:00:23.070> stuff

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
actually start working on other stuff

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.310 
actually start working on other stuff
because<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:24.119> it's<00:00:24.420> annoying<00:00:24.630> putting<00:00:25.109> in<00:00:25.230> the

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
because and it's annoying putting in the

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.070 
because and it's annoying putting in the
command<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:26.250> get<00:00:26.400> your<00:00:26.580> item<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.150> it's<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:27.930> lot

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
command to get your item and it's a lot

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.720 
command to get your item and it's a lot
easier<00:00:28.199> just<00:00:28.410> going<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.949> creative<00:00:29.310> do<00:00:29.490> I

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
easier just going to the creative do I

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.880 
easier just going to the creative do I
get<00:00:30.150> your<00:00:30.269> item<00:00:30.630> out<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.019> then<00:00:31.439> we<00:00:31.560> can<00:00:31.590> just

I'm<00:01:48.780> not<00:01:48.899> sure<00:01:49.049> if<00:01:49.140> we<00:01:49.200> can<00:01:49.229> actually<00:01:49.560> go<00:01:49.710> into

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
I'm not sure if we can actually go into

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.190 
I'm not sure if we can actually go into
it<00:01:50.040> let's<00:01:50.159> have<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.280> look<00:01:50.509> okay<00:01:51.509> we<00:01:51.659> can<00:01:51.869> go<00:01:52.049> into

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
it so we've got to override this method

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.550 
it so we've got to override this method

so hopefully you enjoyed this tutorial

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:14.040 
so hopefully you enjoyed this tutorial
today<00:07:12.250> it<00:07:12.580> was<00:07:12.700> a<00:07:12.730> simple<00:07:13.180> one<00:07:13.300> but<00:07:13.600> it<00:07:13.780> had<00:07:13.900> to

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:14.050 
today it was a simple one but it had to

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:14.670 
today it was a simple one but it had to
be<00:07:14.080> done

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:14.680 
be done

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.630 
be done
so<00:07:15.100> next<00:07:15.760> tutorial<00:07:16.360> I'm<00:07:16.510> pretty<00:07:17.290> sure<00:07:17.640> we're

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:18.640 
so next tutorial I'm pretty sure we're

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.840 
so next tutorial I'm pretty sure we're
going<00:07:18.730> to<00:07:18.820> get<00:07:19.030> on<00:07:19.240> with<00:07:20.170> adding<00:07:20.770> tools<00:07:21.160> into

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:21.850 
going to get on with adding tools into

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:24.330 
going to get on with adding tools into
the<00:07:21.970> game<00:07:22.210> so<00:07:22.930> I'm<00:07:23.140> probably<00:07:23.290> going<00:07:23.470> to<00:07:23.530> split

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:24.340 
the game so I'm probably going to split

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.160 
the game so I'm probably going to split
them<00:07:24.490> up<00:07:24.640> into<00:07:24.850> two<00:07:25.180> parts<00:07:25.450> just<00:07:25.810> because

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:26.170 
them up into two parts just because

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:28.940 
them up into two parts just because
there's<00:07:26.470> a<00:07:26.530> lot<00:07:26.650> of<00:07:26.710> tools<00:07:26.980> in<00:07:27.340> the<00:07:27.460> game<00:07:27.810> so

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:28.950 
there's a lot of tools in the game so

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:31.620 
there's a lot of tools in the game so
next<00:07:29.950> tutorial<00:07:30.280> will<00:07:30.400> be<00:07:30.520> tools<00:07:30.760> and<00:07:31.120> I'll<00:07:31.360> see

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:31.630 
next tutorial will be tools and I'll see

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:33.300 
next tutorial will be tools and I'll see
you<00:07:31.780> guys<00:07:31.840> then<00:07:32.200> hopefully<00:07:32.590> enjoyed<00:07:32.920> remember
