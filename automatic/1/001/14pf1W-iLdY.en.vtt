00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.760 
more people involved but you know I'll
get<00:05:11.240> on<00:05:11.360> it<00:05:11.390> so<00:05:11.870> anyway<00:05:12.140> about<00:05:12.170> a<00:05:12.410> week<00:05:12.590> and<00:05:12.710> a

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
get on it so anyway about a week and a

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.320 
get on it so anyway about a week and a
half<00:05:12.830> passed<00:05:13.190> by<00:05:13.370> and<00:05:13.520> I<00:05:13.580> thought<00:05:13.610> now<00:05:14.060> maybe

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
half passed by and I thought now maybe

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.550 
half passed by and I thought now maybe
it<00:05:14.480> doesn't<00:05:14.630> want<00:05:14.840> to<00:05:14.930> do<00:05:15.050> it<00:05:15.080> that's<00:05:15.290> fair

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
it doesn't want to do it that's fair

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.690 
it doesn't want to do it that's fair
enough<00:05:15.590> but<00:05:15.770> then<00:05:16.010> he<00:05:16.070> kind<00:05:16.190> of<00:05:16.280> got<00:05:16.400> back<00:05:16.580> to

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700 
enough but then he kind of got back to

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:17.890 
enough but then he kind of got back to
me<00:05:16.790> he<00:05:16.880> said<00:05:17.060> right<00:05:17.240> I've<00:05:17.419> been<00:05:17.540> super<00:05:17.750> busy

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
me he said right I've been super busy

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.690 
me he said right I've been super busy
but<00:05:18.200> now<00:05:18.560> it<00:05:18.680> can<00:05:18.830> get<00:05:18.919> on<00:05:19.040> with<00:05:19.070> your<00:05:19.250> project
