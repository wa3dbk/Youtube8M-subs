00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
unfold it and want to take two pieces

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.350 
unfold it and want to take two pieces
like<00:00:53.230> this<00:00:53.440> and<00:00:53.710> then<00:00:53.860> collapse<00:00:54.790> it<00:00:55.030> into<00:00:55.120> a

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
like this and then collapse it into a

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.720 
like this and then collapse it into a
turn<00:00:55.800> right

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.630 

so<00:01:02.300> I<00:01:02.359> did<00:01:02.660> just

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
so I did just

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.389 
so I did just
check<00:01:06.640> it<00:01:06.850> like<00:01:07.000> this

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:08.399 
check it like this

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:13.850 
check it like this
folding<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.329> into<00:01:09.740> tarnish<00:01:10.740> collapsed

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.530 

and<00:01:14.340> once<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.610> have<00:01:14.730> that<00:01:14.910> you<00:01:15.090> want<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.360> take

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
and once you have that you want to take

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.600 
and once you have that you want to take
one<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.290> slips<00:01:16.620> and<00:01:16.920> fall<00:01:17.190> it<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.490> the

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
one of the slips and fall it to the

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.890 
one of the slips and fall it to the
middle<00:01:19.910> okay

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
middle okay

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.450

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
low budget

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:32.459 
low budget
they<00:01:31.270> want<00:01:31.509> to<00:01:31.600> do<00:01:31.750> the<00:01:31.899> same<00:01:32.140> to<00:01:32.320> the<00:01:32.380> other

side

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.010 

so<00:01:39.400> a<00:01:39.430> little<00:01:39.880> collectors<00:01:40.390> would<00:01:40.540> blow<00:01:40.780> down

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
so a little collectors would blow down

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.560 
so a little collectors would blow down
and<00:01:41.230> then<00:01:42.070> you<00:01:42.220> want<00:01:42.370> to<00:01:42.430> flip<00:01:42.760> that<00:01:42.880> flip<00:01:43.450> it

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
and then you want to flip that flip it

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.020 
and then you want to flip that flip it
over<00:01:43.690> like<00:01:43.930> this<00:01:43.990> and<00:01:44.530> take<00:01:45.280> another<00:01:45.550> edge

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
over like this and take another edge

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.210 
over like this and take another edge
like<00:01:46.360> this<00:01:46.570> and<00:01:46.900> then<00:01:47.020> pull<00:01:47.620> it<00:01:47.740> to<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:47.920> middle

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
like this and then pull it to the middle

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.160 
like this and then pull it to the middle
but<00:01:48.550> like<00:01:49.300> this<00:01:50.080> is<00:01:50.260> that<00:01:50.290> so<00:01:51.780> look<00:01:52.780> like<00:01:53.020> that

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
but like this is that so look like that

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.740 
but like this is that so look like that
it's<00:01:53.320> like<00:01:53.560> a<00:01:53.590> little<00:01:53.800> foot<00:01:54.520> like<00:01:54.700> that<00:01:54.750> and

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
it's like a little foot like that and

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.870 
it's like a little foot like that and
then<00:01:56.500> you<00:01:56.590> want<00:01:56.770> to<00:01:56.800> do<00:01:57.040> the<00:01:57.460> same<00:01:57.700> to

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
then you want to do the same to

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.320 
then you want to do the same to
