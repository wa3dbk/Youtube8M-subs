like<00:02:05.660> that<00:02:05.690> i<00:02:05.930> think<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:06.890> process<00:02:07.100> of<00:02:07.490> not

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
like that i think the process of not

like that i think the process of not
getting<00:02:08.030> better<00:02:08.330> still<00:02:09.319> is<00:02:09.709> still<00:02:10.310> just<00:02:10.610> that

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
getting better still is still just that

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.970 
getting better still is still just that
a<00:02:10.819> process<00:02:11.360> i<00:02:11.569> thought<00:02:12.349> we<00:02:12.470> did<00:02:12.650> some<00:02:12.830> more

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980
