00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.690

 castella miguel otero 950 I was in 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.889
 my house bored so I wanted to play the 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.500
 red pokémon game since it's my 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.020
 favorite I went to look for the gameboy in the 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.510
 trunk and I was missing the game I looked for it and 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.890
 I did not find it so I asked my 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.410
 family and they told me that they had 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.260
 gifted so I went to the market and bought 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.390
 red pokemon but the game said special 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.850
 edition under the name missed me 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.250
 but I still bought it after 3 days 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.170
 I had everything normal without problems but 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.120
 when I go to buy because you go to the 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.309
 store is the delivery guy 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.610
 events I speak to him and he gives me the ticket to 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.890
 go to the island origin the dose island 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:49.260

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.570
 island that's why I'll regret my whole life 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.850
 he came to the island and ordered the stone and 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.309
 deceased leaves fight with him on his way 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.410

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.449
 it was yellow how weird I said then what 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.910
 weakened and captured it when I go to see 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.350
 my pokémons had all disappeared 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.049
 - one of oxy but good does not matter 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.150
 then he captured a mac with at level 22 and 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.340
 also disappears but not opsis 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.560
 disappeared it scares me so I'm going to 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.330
 release it when pressed if to 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.130
 release it nothing happens but their 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.350
 statistics and I realize that 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.540
 have a letter that said if you want 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.670
 free me take me where you found me 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.340
 and then say yes to the coach who 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.530
 It is there went to the island to take home 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.080
 of oxy if the coach was there as 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.180
 he said of opsis then he spoke to him and I read 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.369
 just the first thing but I got bored and I passed it 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.860
 fast I saw a red part but I did not 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.229
 it mattered and I passed it fast and press yes 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.270
 but what I did not know is that the part 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.399
 in red I said to sell my soul to 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.069
 opsis two of them out of the PO 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.670
 dance and attack me directly turn off 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:51.950
 the gameboy 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.690
 I was frightened of more that moment but what 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.789
 I went back to learning and before the 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.920
 pokemon intro music sounded a 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.020
 terrifying music and he started giving me a 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.590
 giant migraine and I started to bleed by 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.560
 nose 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.659
 quickly turn off the gameboy and from 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.770
 that moment I can not stop thinking that a 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.770
 game has my soul
