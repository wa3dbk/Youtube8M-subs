00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
spraying right by my roots here because

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.270 
spraying right by my roots here because
that's<00:01:53.080> where<00:01:53.410> the<00:01:53.590> hair<00:01:53.800> is<00:01:54.010> going<00:01:54.160> to<00:01:54.220> be

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.940 

and<00:02:02.789> then<00:02:03.659> once<00:02:03.869> that<00:02:03.960> dries<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.560> can<00:02:04.619> kind<00:02:04.890> of

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
and then once that dries you can kind of

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.440 
and then once that dries you can kind of
piece<00:02:05.189> them<00:02:05.399> out<00:02:05.549> if<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.820> like<00:02:06.000> them<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.210> little

bit more in front of your face and this
way<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.239> gives<00:02:09.360> them<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.629> lift<00:02:09.989> to<00:02:10.140> think<00:02:10.440> so

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
way it gives them the lift to think so
