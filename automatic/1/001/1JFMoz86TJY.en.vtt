00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.590
 samsung seeks to dethrone the ipads of 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.910
 apple with these two new tablets and 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.650
 everything seems to indicate that they have achieved it 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.750
 how are you I'm vanessa hand orellana 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.110
 for cinema in Spanish with the first 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.400
 look at the galaxytab s from samsung to 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.130
 simple view looks like a version 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.320
 gigantic galaxy s 5 with the same 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.109
 plastic cover with texture of 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.519
 holes but unlike the phone 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.490
 you will notice that it has gold edges 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:36.800
 champagne and it comes in white and in gray 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.170
 dark you will find me in the monitor of 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.060
 heart rate that has ls 5 but these 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.800
 tablets if they come with the same sensor 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.410
 fingerprint to unlock the 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.090
 screen and make purchases on the internet and 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.190
 another thing that caught my attention is what 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.080
 light they are and in this industry how 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.430
 they pay more attention to the figure and 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.430
 weight that in a beauty pageant 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.630
 I suppose they had to highlight it 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.840
 samsung presumes that even though 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:02.540
 screens are larger than 8.4 and 10.5 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.559
 inches weigh less and are thinner 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.450
 that the ipads mini jr 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.990
 and also their screens have better 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:13.470
 resolution that the retina of the ipad with 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.270
 2560 x 1600 pixels super amoled one of 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.939
 The strengths of the tablets is the 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.740
 experience watching video I recommend you 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.420
 use the native app that comes with the 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.340
 tablet that gives you a variety of 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.130
 viewing options as the option 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.140
 amoled to see the image sharper with 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.600
 deeper blacks and more vivid colors 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.640
 but beware that not all the content is seen 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.679
 better with this option sometimes tends to 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.569
 over saturate the colors especially 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:39.090
 those of the problem skin that we saw in 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:41.100
 the s5 the sound quality is not so 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.170
 good as the quality of the image but 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.789
 it's pretty decent the only thing that I do not 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.860
 liked is the positioning of the 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:49.439
 horns on each side especially in the 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.209
 8.4-inch version when the 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.640
 held with two hands to watch videos 

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:55.349
 covers part of the horn and also 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.909
 you end up pressing the buttons by 

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:59.310
 mistake with the hand when the 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.229
 subject but vertically if you 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.390
 feel comfortable both come with a 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.670
 8 megapixel main camera and a 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.530
 led flash and did not disappoint in the quality 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.359
 of the images you take especially 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.420
 to make a tablet and camera 

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:12.550

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.090

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.550

 android kitkat version 4.4 and by 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.110
 quickly I can not complain about the disadvantage 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.630
 is that you will pay for quality are not 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.239

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.819
