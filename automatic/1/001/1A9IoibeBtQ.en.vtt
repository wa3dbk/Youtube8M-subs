00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
rockets spurs or Mavericks now the

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.140 
rockets spurs or Mavericks now the
Rockets<00:01:20.189> have<00:01:20.280> gotten<00:01:20.549> two<00:01:20.759> back-to-back

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
Rockets have gotten two back-to-back

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.929

tiles<00:01:21.659> in<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.900> early<00:01:22.170> 90s<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.939> Spurs

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
tiles in the early 90s and the Spurs

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.510 
tiles in the early 90s and the Spurs
were<00:01:24.150> coming<00:01:24.450> along<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.680> think<00:01:25.710> they'd<00:01:26.040> 11

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
were coming along and I think they'd 11

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.460 
were coming along and I think they'd 11
so<00:01:27.180> far<00:01:27.420> they're<00:01:27.600> building<00:01:27.900> their<00:01:28.020> dynasty

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
but I really couldn't connect with those

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.240 
but I really couldn't connect with those
routines<00:01:30.810> one<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.590> just<00:01:31.890> didn't<00:01:32.100> like<00:01:32.189> the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250

the history I like a team based on the

00:06:59.499 --> 00:07:01.169 
the history I like a team based on the
fact<00:06:59.739> that<00:06:59.829> you<00:07:00.279> know<00:07:00.399> they<00:07:00.639> represent<00:07:01.149> the
