five inches and I'll take my flush

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.529 
five inches and I'll take my flush
cutters<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:45.860> cut<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.010> end<00:00:47.160> so<00:00:48.149> I'm<00:00:48.239> setting

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
cutters and cut the end so I'm setting

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.779 
cutters and cut the end so I'm setting
down<00:00:48.629> my<00:00:48.780> ruler<00:00:49.079> I'll<00:00:49.320> cut<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.670> have

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
down my ruler I'll cut that so I have

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.869 
down my ruler I'll cut that so I have
one<00:00:51.000> five<00:00:51.239> inch<00:00:51.480> piece<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:52.340> need<00:00:53.340> another<00:00:53.610> five

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879

inch piece I can measure it with my

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.270 
inch piece I can measure it with my
ruler<00:00:55.829> again<00:00:56.329> or<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.660> can<00:00:58.440> just<00:00:58.469> hold<00:00:58.859> up<00:00:59.039> the

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
ruler again or I can just hold up the

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.810 
ruler again or I can just hold up the
two<00:01:00.469> the<00:01:01.469> piece<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.739> wire<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:02.070> already<00:01:02.399> cut

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
two the piece of wire that I already cut

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.450 
two the piece of wire that I already cut
and<00:01:03.090> use<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.439> measure<00:01:04.559> all<00:01:05.129> right<00:01:05.280> the

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
and use that to measure all right the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.100 
and use that to measure all right the
next<00:01:05.700> thing<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:05.880> I'm<00:01:06.150> going<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.420> do<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.750> bend

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
next thing that I'm going to do is bend

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.890 
next thing that I'm going to do is bend
my<00:01:07.439> wire<00:01:07.710> into<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.189> round<00:01:08.460> circle<00:01:08.760> so<00:01:09.659> I'll<00:01:09.750> take

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
my wire into a round circle so I'll take

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.250 
my wire into a round circle so I'll take
my<00:01:09.960> mandrel<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.939> I'm<00:01:11.939> just<00:01:12.210> wrapping<00:01:12.450> the

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
my mandrel and I'm just wrapping the

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.289 
my mandrel and I'm just wrapping the
wire<00:01:13.290> loosely<00:01:14.070> around<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.770> pressing<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:17.299> now

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
wire loosely around and pressing it now

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.880 
wire loosely around and pressing it now
you<00:01:18.360> see<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.720> bounces<00:01:19.080> back<00:01:19.110> up<00:01:19.470> that's<00:01:19.680> called

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
you see it bounces back up that's called

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.270 
you see it bounces back up that's called
spring<00:01:20.369> back<00:01:20.640> metal<00:01:21.509> does<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:22.100> so<00:01:23.100> now<00:01:23.220> I

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
spring back metal does that so now I

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.240 
spring back metal does that so now I
have<00:01:23.610> almost<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.659> circle<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.890> I'm<00:01:25.979> going<00:01:26.189> to

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
have almost a circle so I'm going to

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.899 
have almost a circle so I'm going to
take<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:27.350> approximately<00:01:28.610> halfway<00:01:29.610> around

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
take this approximately halfway around

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.960 
take this approximately halfway around
the<00:01:30.150> circle<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:31.189> guess<00:01:32.189> if<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.460> were<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.610> clock

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
the circle I guess if that were a clock

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.149 
the circle I guess if that were a clock
it<00:01:33.119> would<00:01:33.240> be<00:01:33.360> about<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.869> ten<00:01:34.409> o'clock<00:01:34.619> position

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
it would be about a ten o'clock position

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.630 
it would be about a ten o'clock position
I<00:01:35.600> hold<00:01:36.600> both<00:01:37.380> wires<00:01:37.680> with<00:01:38.250> my<00:01:38.400> chain<00:01:38.610> nose

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
I hold both wires with my chain nose

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.990 
I hold both wires with my chain nose
pliers<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.930> will<00:01:40.110> take<00:01:40.320> my<00:01:40.500> thumb<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.000> make

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
pliers and I will take my thumb and make

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.740 
pliers and I will take my thumb and make
a<00:01:42.030> slight<00:01:42.600> Bend<00:01:43.320> until<00:01:43.970> the<00:01:44.970> ends<00:01:45.210> crossover

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
a slight Bend until the ends crossover

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.899 
a slight Bend until the ends crossover
just<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:46.049> little<00:01:46.290> bit<00:01:46.439> I've<00:01:47.159> got<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.579> figure<00:01:47.729> out

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
just a little bit I've got to figure out

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.700 
just a little bit I've got to figure out
where<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.180> want<00:01:48.270> my<00:01:48.509> dangle<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.049> be<00:01:49.170> where<00:01:49.680> I

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
where I want my dangle to be where I

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.560 
where I want my dangle to be where I
want<00:01:49.979> my<00:01:50.040> bead<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:50.850> I'm<00:01:51.000> going<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.240> show<00:01:51.390> off

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
want my bead that I'm going to show off

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.350 
want my bead that I'm going to show off
so<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.290> want<00:01:52.649> that<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.860> hang<00:01:53.040> out<00:01:53.189> right<00:01:53.970> about

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
so I want that to hang out right about

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.950 
so I want that to hang out right about
there<00:01:54.829> probably<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:56.130> safe<00:01:57.030> between<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.780> four

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
there probably the safe between the four

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.300 
there probably the safe between the four
and<00:01:58.079> five<00:01:58.200> o'clock<00:01:58.469> position<00:01:58.890> if<00:01:59.009> this<00:01:59.159> were<00:01:59.280> a

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
and five o'clock position if this were a

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.060 
and five o'clock position if this were a

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
so that I make a bend in the same place

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.699 
so that I make a bend in the same place
so<00:02:13.269> I<00:02:13.299> have<00:02:13.540> this<00:02:13.659> neat<00:02:13.930> little<00:02:13.959> shape<00:02:14.379> here

slide that on and that's how that old
angle<00:02:20.260> to<00:02:21.189> get<00:02:21.310> that<00:02:21.459> to<00:02:21.640> stay<00:02:21.849> though<00:02:22.060> because

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
angle to get that to stay though because

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.030 
angle to get that to stay though because
you<00:02:22.599> this<00:02:22.900> would<00:02:23.049> come<00:02:23.230> off<00:02:23.409> if<00:02:23.590> I<00:02:23.709> just<00:02:23.860> left

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
all the way around by just grabbing it

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.949 
all the way around by just grabbing it
with<00:03:16.959> my<00:03:17.290> pliers<00:03:17.560> and<00:03:18.540> cinching<00:03:19.540> it<00:03:19.660> up<00:03:21.959> I'm

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
with my pliers and cinching it up I'm

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.050 
with my pliers and cinching it up I'm
going<00:03:23.260> to<00:03:23.379> make<00:03:23.500> the<00:03:23.620> other<00:03:23.829> earring<00:03:24.160> and<00:03:24.519> I'm

going to make the other earring and I'm
going<00:03:25.510> to<00:03:25.540> make<00:03:25.720> it<00:03:25.900> a<00:03:26.019> mirror<00:03:26.410> image<00:03:26.620> of<00:03:26.949> this

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
going to make it a mirror image of this

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.680 
going to make it a mirror image of this
one<00:03:27.310> because<00:03:27.790> they<00:03:27.910> go<00:03:28.030> on<00:03:28.060> either<00:03:28.359> side<00:03:28.660> of

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
one because they go on either side of

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:29.309 
one because they go on either side of
your<00:03:28.900> head

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
so when I hook this one around this hook

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.650 
so when I hook this one around this hook
will<00:03:32.530> be<00:03:33.160> around<00:03:33.849> the<00:03:33.970> other<00:03:34.090> side<00:03:34.389> of<00:03:34.540> the

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
will be around the other side of the

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.589 
will be around the other side of the
wire<00:03:34.840> I<00:03:35.079> slide<00:03:35.709> on<00:03:35.829> my<00:03:35.859> bead<00:03:36.220> but<00:03:37.150> I'm<00:03:37.269> going<00:03:37.510> to

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
wire I slide on my bead but I'm going to

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.080 
wire I slide on my bead but I'm going to
put<00:03:37.780> that<00:03:37.959> wire<00:03:38.889> on<00:03:39.190> the<00:03:39.370> other<00:03:39.400> side<00:03:39.910> this

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
put that wire on the other side this

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:46.680 
put that wire on the other side this
time<00:03:44.250> grab<00:03:45.250> it

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
time grab it

my<00:04:03.349> pliers<00:04:04.030> from<00:04:05.030> this<00:04:05.209> point<00:04:05.480> I<00:04:05.689> have<00:04:05.840> to

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
my pliers from this point I have to

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.289 
my pliers from this point I have to
decide<00:04:06.290> how<00:04:07.069> much<00:04:07.280> of<00:04:07.340> this<00:04:07.670> that<00:04:08.180> I<00:04:08.209> want

decide how much of this that I want

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.839 
decide how much of this that I want
hanging<00:04:08.840> down<00:04:09.019> off<00:04:09.319> the<00:04:09.920> back<00:04:10.069> of<00:04:10.220> my<00:04:10.400> ear<00:04:10.640> I

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
hanging down off the back of my ear I

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:14.350 
hanging down off the back of my ear I
can<00:04:11.840> leave<00:04:12.019> them<00:04:12.170> long<00:04:12.349> like<00:04:12.590> this<00:04:12.860> or<00:04:13.519> I<00:04:13.940> can

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
can leave them long like this or I can

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:21.340 
can leave them long like this or I can
simply<00:04:15.200> trim<00:04:15.680> them<00:04:15.829> off<00:04:18.070> to<00:04:19.070> match<00:04:19.870> and<00:04:20.870> I<00:04:21.169> used

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
simply trim them off to match and I used

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.050 
simply trim them off to match and I used
my<00:04:21.530> flush<00:04:21.859> cutters<00:04:22.220> so<00:04:22.490> that<00:04:22.669> should<00:04:22.910> be<00:04:23.030> a

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
my flush cutters so that should be a
