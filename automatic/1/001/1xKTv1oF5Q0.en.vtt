first about them and look at them now

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.719 
first about them and look at them now
maybe<00:02:07.229> it's<00:02:07.439> not<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:07.619> we<00:02:07.829> need<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.099> well<00:02:08.429> we

maybe it's not that we need it well we

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.369 
maybe it's not that we need it well we
definitely<00:02:08.879> don't<00:02:09.209> need<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.629> but<00:02:09.780> just<00:02:10.110> that

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
definitely don't need it but just that

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.430 
definitely don't need it but just that
we<00:02:10.619> won't<00:02:10.950> it

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
we won't it

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.700 
we won't it
would<00:02:11.680> be<00:02:11.710> pretty<00:02:12.040> cool<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:13.480> infinity<00:02:14.260> and

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
would be pretty cool to infinity and

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.490 
would be pretty cool to infinity and
beyond<00:02:15.420> one<00:02:16.420> thing<00:02:16.630> I<00:02:16.720> do<00:02:16.780> think<00:02:17.110> though<00:02:17.260> if

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
beyond one thing I do think though if

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.440 
beyond one thing I do think though if
anybody<00:02:18.040> can<00:02:18.250> do<00:02:18.370> it<00:02:18.460> right<00:02:18.670> I<00:02:18.910> think<00:02:19.240> it<00:02:19.330> would

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
anybody can do it right I think it would

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.720 
anybody can do it right I think it would
be<00:02:19.570> Apple<00:02:20.080> they've<00:02:20.440> got<00:02:20.620> plenty<00:02:21.010> of<00:02:21.190> money<00:02:21.490> as

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
be Apple they've got plenty of money as

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.190 
be Apple they've got plenty of money as
well<00:02:21.910> as<00:02:21.970> I<00:02:22.210> think<00:02:22.270> the<00:02:22.570> right<00:02:22.750> people<00:02:23.140> in

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
well as I think the right people in

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.650 
well as I think the right people in
place<00:02:23.230> to<00:02:23.890> make<00:02:24.040> a<00:02:24.070> really<00:02:24.640> nice<00:02:24.790> SmartWatch

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
place to make a really nice SmartWatch

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.660 
place to make a really nice SmartWatch
and<00:02:25.960> do<00:02:26.200> it<00:02:26.380> right<00:02:26.620> one<00:02:27.040> question<00:02:27.400> I<00:02:27.490> have

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
and do it right one question I have

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.520 
and do it right one question I have
though<00:02:27.700> is<00:02:27.940> what<00:02:28.480> would<00:02:28.600> a<00:02:28.660> SmartWatch<00:02:29.200> to<00:02:29.380> do

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
though is what would a SmartWatch to do

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.500 
though is what would a SmartWatch to do
other<00:02:29.890> than<00:02:30.070> tell<00:02:30.490> the<00:02:30.670> time<00:02:30.910> that<00:02:31.210> would<00:02:31.330> even

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
other than tell the time that would even

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.240 
other than tell the time that would even
make<00:02:31.600> it<00:02:31.900> worth<00:02:32.080> it<00:02:32.320> if<00:02:32.530> Apple<00:02:32.890> does<00:02:33.040> make<00:02:33.220> a

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
make it worth it if Apple does make a

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.010 
make it worth it if Apple does make a
SmartWatch<00:02:33.790> I<00:02:34.030> think<00:02:34.270> it's<00:02:34.390> gonna<00:02:34.480> have<00:02:34.720> heavy

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
SmartWatch I think it's gonna have heavy

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.500 
SmartWatch I think it's gonna have heavy
integration<00:02:35.680> with<00:02:35.830> the<00:02:35.920> iPhone<00:02:36.370> iOS<00:02:36.730> as<00:02:37.300> well

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
integration with the iPhone iOS as well

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.480 
integration with the iPhone iOS as well
as<00:02:37.600> the<00:02:37.720> iCloud<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.980> give<00:02:39.100> you<00:02:39.190> things<00:02:39.310> like

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
as the iCloud to give you things like

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.490 
as the iCloud to give you things like
notifications<00:02:40.420> and<00:02:40.600> alerts<00:02:40.720> and<00:02:41.170> stuff<00:02:41.350> like

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
notifications and alerts and stuff like

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.770 
notifications and alerts and stuff like
that<00:02:41.770> but<00:02:42.430> at<00:02:42.520> the<00:02:42.550> same<00:02:42.730> time<00:02:43.000> are<00:02:43.510> you<00:02:43.660> gonna

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
that but at the same time are you gonna

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.350 
that but at the same time are you gonna
have<00:02:44.080> to<00:02:44.230> have<00:02:44.320> an<00:02:44.440> iPhone<00:02:44.560> or<00:02:45.070> other<00:02:45.580> Apple

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
have to have an iPhone or other Apple

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.690 
have to have an iPhone or other Apple
devices<00:02:46.630> to<00:02:46.960> use<00:02:47.140> it<00:02:47.320> because<00:02:47.860> I<00:02:48.040> think<00:02:48.220> it's

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
devices to use it because I think it's

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.850 
devices to use it because I think it's
needs<00:02:49.210> to<00:02:49.420> be<00:02:49.510> its<00:02:49.660> own<00:02:49.780> standalone<00:02:50.290> product

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
needs to be its own standalone product

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.890 
needs to be its own standalone product
or<00:02:51.070> it<00:02:51.220> won't<00:02:51.490> be<00:02:51.670> worth<00:02:52.180> getting<00:02:52.600> one<00:02:52.750> in<00:02:52.870> the

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
or it won't be worth getting one in the

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.420 
or it won't be worth getting one in the
first<00:02:53.140> place<00:02:53.380> so<00:02:53.830> basically<00:02:54.130> what<00:02:54.310> I'm<00:02:54.400> saying

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
first place so basically what I'm saying

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.030 
first place so basically what I'm saying
is<00:02:54.880> what<00:02:55.300> is<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.630> iWatch<00:02:56.020> gonna<00:02:56.320> do<00:02:56.530> that<00:02:56.830> all

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.770 
things I think the eye watch has to have
is<00:03:11.710> Siri<00:03:12.100> because<00:03:12.730> I<00:03:13.060> know<00:03:13.120> I'm<00:03:13.360> not<00:03:13.510> gonna<00:03:13.660> be

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
is Siri because I know I'm not gonna be

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.720 
is Siri because I know I'm not gonna be
typing<00:03:14.230> on<00:03:14.350> my<00:03:14.380> wrist<00:03:14.770> and<00:03:15.070> I<00:03:15.340> don't<00:03:15.430> think

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
typing on my wrist and I don't think

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:16.800 
typing on my wrist and I don't think
they're<00:03:15.850> gonna<00:03:15.970> give<00:03:16.150> you<00:03:16.239> a<00:03:16.300> full<00:03:16.540> keyboard

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
they're gonna give you a full keyboard

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.170 
they're gonna give you a full keyboard
on<00:03:17.170> it<00:03:17.200> so<00:03:17.860> Siri<00:03:18.190> is<00:03:18.370> probably<00:03:18.700> gonna<00:03:18.850> have<00:03:19.150> to

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
on it so Siri is probably gonna have to

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.850 
on it so Siri is probably gonna have to
be<00:03:19.450> integrated<00:03:19.750> with<00:03:20.050> it<00:03:20.230> but<00:03:20.530> at<00:03:20.620> the<00:03:20.680> same

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
be integrated with it but at the same

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.220 
be integrated with it but at the same
time<00:03:21.130> they<00:03:21.610> need<00:03:21.790> to<00:03:21.820> make<00:03:22.030> Siri<00:03:22.330> a<00:03:22.570> lot<00:03:22.930> better

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
time they need to make Siri a lot better

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.750 
time they need to make Siri a lot better
if<00:03:23.380> you<00:03:23.470> look<00:03:23.650> at<00:03:23.770> Google's<00:03:24.100> voice<00:03:24.280> search<00:03:24.550> now

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
if you look at Google's voice search now

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.540 
if you look at Google's voice search now
it<00:03:25.030> is<00:03:25.360> way<00:03:25.780> faster<00:03:26.410> and<00:03:26.440> way<00:03:27.100> better

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
it is way faster and way better

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.880 
it is way faster and way better
so<00:03:27.970> Apple<00:03:28.330> you<00:03:28.600> need<00:03:28.750> a<00:03:28.780> step<00:03:29.110> up<00:03:29.260> Siri<00:03:29.530> before

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
so Apple you need a step up Siri before

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.470 
so Apple you need a step up Siri before
you<00:03:29.950> put<00:03:30.100> it<00:03:30.220> in<00:03:30.280> I<00:03:30.370> watch<00:03:30.640> could<00:03:31.090> you<00:03:31.180> answer<00:03:31.360> a

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
you put it in I watch could you answer a

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.510 
you put it in I watch could you answer a
call<00:03:31.750> as<00:03:31.989> I<00:03:32.140> watch<00:03:32.380> or<00:03:32.709> would<00:03:32.950> you<00:03:33.040> even<00:03:33.220> want

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
call as I watch or would you even want

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.070 
call as I watch or would you even want
to<00:03:33.640> oh<00:03:33.970> look

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
to oh look

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.640 
to oh look
mom's<00:03:35.320> calling<00:03:35.590> hey<00:03:36.520> what's<00:03:36.730> up<00:03:37.200> yeah<00:03:38.200> I<00:03:38.380> just

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
mom's calling hey what's up yeah I just

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.530 
mom's calling hey what's up yeah I just
don't<00:03:38.800> see<00:03:38.920> that<00:03:39.100> I<00:03:39.340> think<00:03:39.640> they<00:03:39.730> also<00:03:39.910> have<00:03:40.120> to

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
don't see that I think they also have to

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.729 
don't see that I think they also have to
make<00:03:40.660> the<00:03:40.780> battery<00:03:41.050> last<00:03:41.110> a<00:03:41.500> long<00:03:41.709> time

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
make the battery last a long time

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.770 
make the battery last a long time
because<00:03:42.220> I<00:03:42.580> don't<00:03:42.940> want<00:03:43.090> to<00:03:43.150> be<00:03:43.209> charging<00:03:43.570> a

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
because I don't want to be charging a

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.420 
because I don't want to be charging a
device<00:03:44.110> that<00:03:44.410> I<00:03:44.440> already<00:03:44.890> don't<00:03:45.070> wear<00:03:45.220> in<00:03:45.340> the

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
device that I already don't wear in the

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.280 
device that I already don't wear in the
first<00:03:45.640> place<00:03:45.880> on<00:03:46.120> a<00:03:46.150> day-to-day<00:03:46.510> basis<00:03:47.050> it's

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
first place on a day-to-day basis it's

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.900 
first place on a day-to-day basis it's
also<00:03:47.530> gonna<00:03:47.800> have<00:03:48.010> a<00:03:48.070> really<00:03:48.459> good<00:03:48.670> price

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
also gonna have a really good price

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.220 
also gonna have a really good price
point<00:03:49.150> because<00:03:49.480> I<00:03:49.510> don't<00:03:49.840> see<00:03:49.989> a<00:03:50.019> lot<00:03:50.200> of

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
point because I don't see a lot of

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.170 
point because I don't see a lot of
people<00:03:50.410> paying<00:03:50.830> a<00:03:51.160> ton<00:03:51.550> of<00:03:51.580> money<00:03:51.820> for<00:03:52.120> a

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
people paying a ton of money for a

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.600 
people paying a ton of money for a
SmartWatch<00:03:52.930> they<00:03:53.260> don't<00:03:53.530> really<00:03:53.800> need<00:03:54.010> and<00:03:54.340> I

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
SmartWatch they don't really need and I

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:55.860 
SmartWatch they don't really need and I
don't<00:03:54.760> really<00:03:54.880> see<00:03:55.090> this<00:03:55.239> as<00:03:55.450> something<00:03:55.660> like

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
don't really see this as something like

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.259 
don't really see this as something like
an<00:03:56.050> iPhone<00:03:56.230> or<00:03:56.680> a<00:03:56.709> tablet<00:03:56.769> I<00:03:57.430> see<00:03:58.060> it<00:03:58.150> as

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
an iPhone or a tablet I see it as

00:03:58.269 --> 00:03:59.759 
an iPhone or a tablet I see it as
something<00:03:58.600> like<00:03:58.630> an<00:03:58.900> addition<00:03:59.380> to<00:03:59.500> what<00:03:59.650> we

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
something like an addition to what we

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:01.860 
something like an addition to what we
already<00:03:59.950> have<00:04:00.280> so<00:04:00.610> I<00:04:00.850> just<00:04:01.450> don't<00:04:01.630> see<00:04:01.780> a<00:04:01.810> lot

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
already have so I just don't see a lot

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.120 
already have so I just don't see a lot
of<00:04:01.989> people<00:04:02.140> going<00:04:02.440> out<00:04:02.530> and<00:04:02.590> spend<00:04:02.860> a<00:04:02.920> ton<00:04:03.070> of

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
of people going out and spend a ton of

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.130 
of people going out and spend a ton of
money<00:04:03.340> on<00:04:03.640> a<00:04:03.700> SmartWatch<00:04:04.269> they<00:04:04.570> really<00:04:04.930> don't

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
money on a SmartWatch they really don't

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.840
