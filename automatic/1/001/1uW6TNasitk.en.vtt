up
if<00:03:45.240> everyone<00:03:45.630> want<00:03:45.810> to<00:03:45.900> wanted<00:03:46.440> to<00:03:46.500> have<00:03:46.650> push

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
if everyone want to wanted to have push

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.020 
if everyone want to wanted to have push
up<00:03:47.490> this<00:03:47.690> we're<00:03:48.690> gonna<00:03:48.780> go<00:03:48.990> 30<00:03:49.740> seconds<00:03:50.220> 30

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
up this we're gonna go 30 seconds 30

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.240 
up this we're gonna go 30 seconds 30
Hertz<00:03:51.330> love<00:03:51.720> what<00:03:52.650> we're<00:03:52.830> do

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
Hertz love what we're do

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.270 
Hertz love what we're do
get<00:03:53.940> into<00:03:54.090> a<00:03:54.180> push-up<00:03:54.360> position<00:03:55.190> you're<00:03:56.190> gonna

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
get into a push-up position you're gonna

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.470 
get into a push-up position you're gonna
all<00:03:56.520> the<00:03:56.820> way<00:03:56.880> down

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
all the way down

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.840 
all the way down
so<00:03:57.810> that's<00:03:57.990> your<00:03:58.140> one<00:03:58.320> you<00:03:59.040> go<00:03:59.160> half<00:03:59.400> way<00:03:59.430> down

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
so that's your one you go half way down

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.420 
so that's your one you go half way down
and<00:04:00.270> then<00:04:00.450> back<00:04:00.600> up<00:04:00.800> keep<00:04:01.800> going<00:04:01.950> all<00:04:02.130> the<00:04:02.310> way

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
and then back up keep going all the way

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.570 
and then back up keep going all the way
down<00:04:02.520> up<00:04:03.330> you're<00:04:04.260> gonna<00:04:04.350> go<00:04:04.530> down<00:04:04.890> half<00:04:05.550> way

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
down up you're gonna go down half way

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.840 
down up you're gonna go down half way
and<00:04:06.120> enough<00:04:07.110> so<00:04:07.800> basically<00:04:08.220> all<00:04:08.370> you're<00:04:08.670> doing

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
and enough so basically all you're doing

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.460 
and enough so basically all you're doing
is<00:04:08.970> you're<00:04:09.180> doing<00:04:09.210> a<00:04:09.450> full<00:04:09.720> push-up<00:04:10.050> and<00:04:10.440> then

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
is you're doing a full push-up and then

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.830 
is you're doing a full push-up and then
you<00:04:11.040> come<00:04:11.280> down<00:04:11.460> and<00:04:11.670> do<00:04:11.790> a<00:04:11.820> half<00:04:12.120> push-up<00:04:12.630> and

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
you come down and do a half push-up and

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.510 
you come down and do a half push-up and
a<00:04:12.870> half<00:04:13.110> push-up<00:04:13.530> can<00:04:13.710> we<00:04:13.800> go<00:04:13.950> from<00:04:14.160> the<00:04:14.250> middle

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
a half push-up can we go from the middle

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.340 
a half push-up can we go from the middle
up<00:04:14.820> where<00:04:15.540> you<00:04:15.630> can<00:04:15.720> play<00:04:15.900> around<00:04:16.020> with<00:04:16.170> they

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
up where you can play around with they

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.050 
up where you can play around with they
go<00:04:16.500> from<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:16.770> middle<00:04:16.950> down<00:04:17.250> so<00:04:17.880> you're<00:04:18.030> just

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
go from the middle down so you're just

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.510 
go from the middle down so you're just
incorporating<00:04:18.930> not<00:04:19.140> just<00:04:19.440> continuous<00:04:20.340> full

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.520 
incorporating not just continuous full

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.280 
incorporating not just continuous full
push-ups<00:04:20.940> you're<00:04:21.360> just<00:04:21.540> slowing<00:04:21.900> up<00:04:22.140> that

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
push-ups you're just slowing up that

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.440 
push-ups you're just slowing up that
process<00:04:22.530> a<00:04:22.890> little<00:04:22.920> bit<00:04:23.190> so<00:04:24.030> that's<00:04:24.210> gonna<00:04:24.360> be

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
process a little bit so that's gonna be

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.770 
process a little bit so that's gonna be
30<00:04:24.780> Hertz<00:04:25.050> low<00:04:25.320> for<00:04:25.950> 30<00:04:26.130> seconds<00:04:26.700> so<00:04:26.850> we've<00:04:27.630> got

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
30 Hertz low for 30 seconds so we've got

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.870 
30 Hertz low for 30 seconds so we've got
a<00:04:27.810> little<00:04:27.990> bit<00:04:28.200> of<00:04:28.350> some<00:04:28.500> balance<00:04:28.890> work<00:04:29.070> in<00:04:29.280> got

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
a little bit of some balance work in got

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.910 
a little bit of some balance work in got
some<00:04:30.030> explosiveness<00:04:30.660> we've<00:04:31.410> got<00:04:31.530> some<00:04:31.680> length

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
some explosiveness we've got some length

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.190 
some explosiveness we've got some length
work<00:04:32.340> in<00:04:32.580> and<00:04:32.940> then<00:04:33.210> finally<00:04:33.540> nice<00:04:33.690> upper<00:04:33.990> body

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
work in and then finally nice upper body

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.710 
work in and then finally nice upper body
so<00:04:34.920> these<00:04:35.100> are<00:04:35.280> just<00:04:35.430> some<00:04:35.610> basic<00:04:35.820> exercise

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
so these are just some basic exercise

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.410 
so these are just some basic exercise
you<00:04:36.900> could<00:04:37.050> take<00:04:37.230> to<00:04:37.830> the<00:04:37.950> plate<00:04:38.130> help<00:04:39.000> develop

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
you could take to the plate help develop

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.510 
you could take to the plate help develop
pull<00:04:39.690> run<00:04:39.900> and<00:04:40.080> program<00:04:40.290> hopefully<00:04:40.830> it'll

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
pull run and program hopefully it'll

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.310 
pull run and program hopefully it'll
help<00:04:42.180> out<00:04:42.390> with<00:04:42.540> some<00:04:42.720> of<00:04:42.750> your<00:04:42.930> game<00:04:43.050> on<00:04:43.230> the
