00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.940 

basically<00:00:03.600> is<00:00:03.780> only<00:00:04.049> controlling<00:00:04.620> the<00:00:04.710> drone

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
basically is only controlling the drone

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.890 
basically is only controlling the drone
using<00:00:05.400> his<00:00:05.520> hand<00:00:05.730> gestures<00:00:08.120> yeah<00:00:09.120> we<00:00:09.540> try<00:00:09.870> to

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
using his hand gestures yeah we try to

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.379 
using his hand gestures yeah we try to
make<00:00:10.139> it<00:00:10.170> as<00:00:10.380> intuitive<00:00:10.740> as<00:00:11.010> possible<00:00:11.300> kind<00:00:12.300> of

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
make it as intuitive as possible kind of

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:13.879 
make it as intuitive as possible kind of
like<00:00:12.599> if<00:00:12.960> you<00:00:13.019> were<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.380> fly<00:00:13.530> for<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.799> first

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
like if you were to fly for the first

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.860 
like if you were to fly for the first
time<00:00:14.340> you<00:00:14.730> could<00:00:14.969> just<00:00:15.269> kind<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.509> pick<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:15.780> up

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
time you could just kind of pick it up

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.710 
time you could just kind of pick it up
and<00:00:16.020> get<00:00:16.199> it<00:00:16.400> that<00:00:17.400> was<00:00:17.490> kind<00:00:17.730> of<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:18.270> goal<00:00:18.480> for

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
and get it that was kind of the goal for

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.929 
and get it that was kind of the goal for
the<00:00:18.779> project<00:00:19.260> just<00:00:19.320> being<00:00:19.740> really<00:00:20.670> intuitive

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
the project just being really intuitive

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.800 
the project just being really intuitive
over<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.539> conventional<00:00:22.430> interfaces<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:24.150> to

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
over the conventional interfaces to to

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.420 
over the conventional interfaces to to
use<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:24.990> drone<00:00:25.230> like<00:00:25.439> this<00:00:25.590> such<00:00:25.769> as<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.010> iPhone

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
use a drone like this such as the iPhone

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.870 
use a drone like this such as the iPhone
or<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.670> joystick<00:00:26.910> controller<00:00:31.669> this<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.730> a

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
or a joystick controller this is a

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.160 
or a joystick controller this is a
project<00:00:33.180> which<00:00:33.450> deals<00:00:33.840> with<00:00:34.050> our

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
project which deals with our

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.010 
project which deals with our
gastrointestinal<00:00:34.670> endoscopy<00:00:35.670> what<00:00:36.630> happens

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
gastrointestinal endoscopy what happens

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.080 
gastrointestinal endoscopy what happens
is<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.320> an<00:00:37.559> endoscopy<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.520> basically<00:00:38.879> it

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
is that an endoscopy is basically it

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.330 
is that an endoscopy is basically it
consists<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.629> tear<00:00:39.960> on<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.440> small<00:00:41.070> camera

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
consists of a tear on a small camera

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.340 
consists of a tear on a small camera
that<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:41.730> mounted<00:00:41.760> on<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.210> fiber-optic<00:00:42.600> cable

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
that is mounted on a fiber-optic cable

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.979 
that is mounted on a fiber-optic cable
the<00:00:43.620> problem<00:00:44.040> with<00:00:44.160> endoscopy<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.210> 8<00:00:45.780> to

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
the problem with endoscopy is that 8 to

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.440 
the problem with endoscopy is that 8 to
10<00:00:46.200> hours<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.469> videos<00:00:46.860> are<00:00:47.010> generated<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.789> the

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
10 hours of videos are generated and the

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.029 
10 hours of videos are generated and the
doctors<00:00:48.809> have<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.050> literally<00:00:49.410> stare<00:00:49.739> at<00:00:49.890> that

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
doctors have to literally stare at that

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.939 
doctors have to literally stare at that
video<00:00:50.399> for<00:00:50.940> 8<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.239> 10<00:00:51.420> hours<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.870> try<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.620> look

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
video for 8 to 10 hours and try to look

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.529 
video for 8 to 10 hours and try to look
at<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.250> pollen<00:00:53.550> our<00:00:53.760> job<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.270> basically

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
at the pollen our job is to basically

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.840 
at the pollen our job is to basically
automate<00:00:55.199> this<00:00:55.350> whole<00:00:55.530> process<00:00:55.800> every<00:00:56.640> time<00:00:56.670> a

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
automate this whole process every time a

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.959 
automate this whole process every time a
polyp<00:00:57.270> appears<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.899> shows<00:00:58.289> Polly<00:00:58.859> so<00:00:59.550> as<00:00:59.699> the

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
polyp appears it shows Polly so as the

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.040 
polyp appears it shows Polly so as the
endoscopy<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.570> moving<00:01:00.840> through<00:01:00.960> the

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
endoscopy is moving through the

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.369 
endoscopy is moving through the
intestines<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.680> can<00:01:01.800> actually<00:01:01.949> see<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:03.379> say

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
intestines you can actually see it say

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.210 
intestines you can actually see it say
our<00:01:04.530> team<00:01:04.739> uses<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.430> leap

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
our team uses the leap

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.780 
our team uses the leap
so<00:01:06.430> to<00:01:07.410> detect<00:01:08.410> hand<00:01:08.680> movements<00:01:09.250> so<00:01:09.430> what<00:01:09.670> it

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
so to detect hand movements so what it

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.820 
so to detect hand movements so what it
does<00:01:09.910> is<00:01:10.120> it<00:01:10.390> gives<00:01:10.600> us<00:01:10.780> your<00:01:11.230> hand<00:01:11.560> tip

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
does is it gives us your hand tip

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.830 
does is it gives us your hand tip
positions<00:01:12.340> in<00:01:12.490> space<00:01:12.700> and<00:01:13.000> we<00:01:13.270> developed<00:01:13.720> an

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
positions in space and we developed an

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.720 
positions in space and we developed an
algorithm<00:01:14.140> which<00:01:14.530> is<00:01:14.740> able<00:01:15.010> to<00:01:15.130> detect<00:01:15.430> what

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:15.730 
algorithm which is able to detect what

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.220 
algorithm which is able to detect what
gesture<00:01:16.270> you<00:01:16.420> are<00:01:16.480> holding<00:01:16.810> up

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.230 
gesture you are holding up

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.080 
gesture you are holding up
what<00:01:17.590> sign<00:01:17.860> language<00:01:18.280> just<00:01:18.310> you're<00:01:18.670> holding

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
what sign language just you're holding

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.540 
what sign language just you're holding
up<00:01:19.240> so<00:01:19.600> I<00:01:19.870> just<00:01:20.410> know<00:01:20.560> we've<00:01:20.890> been<00:01:21.220> able<00:01:21.400> to

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
up so I just know we've been able to

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.000 
up so I just know we've been able to
complete<00:01:22.300> the<00:01:22.510> English<00:01:22.870> alphabet<00:01:23.080> and<00:01:23.620> the

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 
complete the English alphabet and the

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.730 
complete the English alphabet and the
numbers<00:01:24.040> 1<00:01:24.520> to<00:01:24.670> 9<00:01:24.700> we<00:01:25.690> hope<00:01:25.990> we<00:01:26.140> can<00:01:26.170> extend<00:01:26.560> it

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
numbers 1 to 9 we hope we can extend it

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.650 
numbers 1 to 9 we hope we can extend it
in<00:01:26.830> the<00:01:26.890> future<00:01:27.190> to<00:01:27.310> English<00:01:27.670> words<00:01:27.970> with

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
in the future to English words with

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.120 
in the future to English words with
another<00:01:28.930> device<00:01:29.230> which<00:01:29.530> can<00:01:29.710> probably<00:01:29.890> detect

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
another device which can probably detect

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.340 
another device which can probably detect
parts<00:01:30.790> of<00:01:30.910> your<00:01:31.060> face<00:01:31.210> as<00:01:31.450> well<00:01:31.480> so<00:01:32.110> that<00:01:32.260> we

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
parts of your face as well so that we

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.960 
parts of your face as well so that we
can<00:01:32.500> combine<00:01:32.710> the<00:01:33.010> two<00:01:33.160> to<00:01:33.400> kind<00:01:33.670> of<00:01:33.700> have<00:01:33.850> an

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
can combine the two to kind of have an

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.140 
can combine the two to kind of have an
entire<00:01:34.390> sign<00:01:34.690> language<00:01:35.700> in<00:01:36.700> order<00:01:36.880> to<00:01:36.970> get

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
entire sign language in order to get

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.310 
entire sign language in order to get
prosthetics<00:01:37.810> bastard<00:01:38.620> children<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.930> Faculty

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
prosthetics bastard children the Faculty

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.460 
prosthetics bastard children the Faculty
of<00:01:41.350> information<00:01:41.890> and<00:01:42.220> and<00:01:43.120> we<00:01:44.080> are<00:01:44.170> partnering

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
of information and and we are partnering

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.600 
of information and and we are partnering
with<00:01:44.530> them<00:01:44.920> to<00:01:45.420> produce<00:01:47.040> rapid<00:01:48.040> 3d<00:01:48.280> scanning

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
with them to produce rapid 3d scanning

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.910 
with them to produce rapid 3d scanning
and<00:01:48.910> 3d<00:01:49.000> printing<00:01:49.600> process<00:01:49.720> and<00:01:50.350> we're

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
and 3d printing process and we're

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.030 
and 3d printing process and we're
handling<00:01:51.190> the<00:01:51.400> 3d<00:01:51.640> scanning<00:01:51.970> process

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
handling the 3d scanning process

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.200 
handling the 3d scanning process
so<00:01:54.040> basically<00:01:54.310> we're<00:01:54.520> using<00:01:54.640> structured

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
so basically we're using structured

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.750 
so basically we're using structured
light<00:01:55.420> to<00:01:56.170> scan<00:01:56.710> the<00:01:58.470> lower<00:01:59.470> limb<00:01:59.770> and<00:02:00.070> then

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
light to scan the lower limb and then

automatically<00:02:15.340> so<00:02:15.790> we're<00:02:16.120> using<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:17.230> opencv

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
automatically so we're using the opencv

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.860 
automatically so we're using the opencv
library<00:02:18.040> that<00:02:18.910> will<00:02:19.060> take<00:02:19.239> a<00:02:19.270> picture<00:02:19.480> of<00:02:19.750> a

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
trips you load up all the flights that

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.240 
trips you load up all the flights that
associate<00:02:58.989> with<00:02:59.019> that<00:02:59.110> trip<00:02:59.410> to<00:02:59.920> add<00:03:00.040> another

associate with that trip to add another

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.190 
associate with that trip to add another
trip<00:03:00.489> is<00:03:00.640> very<00:03:00.700> easy<00:03:01.060> you<00:03:01.390> simply<00:03:01.959> state<00:03:02.170> the

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
trip is very easy you simply state the

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.229 
trip is very easy you simply state the
defined<00:03:02.769> number<00:03:02.860> that<00:03:03.580> part<00:03:04.060> would<00:03:04.120> be<00:03:04.180> a

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
defined number that part would be a

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.920 
defined number that part would be a
departure<00:03:04.570> date<00:03:04.810> and<00:03:05.160> you<00:03:06.160> press<00:03:06.340> add

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
departure date and you press add

basically<00:03:07.930> what<00:03:08.230> this<00:03:08.320> project<00:03:08.680> it<00:03:08.769> is<00:03:08.890> is

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
basically what this project it is is

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.470 
basically what this project it is is
this<00:03:09.340> robot<00:03:09.670> that<00:03:09.880> goes<00:03:10.180> our

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
this robot that goes our

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.509 
this robot that goes our
environment<00:03:11.110> and<00:03:11.470> creates<00:03:11.800> a<00:03:11.860> floor<00:03:12.069> plan<00:03:12.280> the

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
environment and creates a floor plan the

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.000 
environment and creates a floor plan the
challenge<00:03:13.450> of<00:03:13.569> this<00:03:13.780> is<00:03:13.959> that<00:03:14.349> it<00:03:14.650> doesn't

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
challenge of this is that it doesn't

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.740 
challenge of this is that it doesn't
already<00:03:15.159> have<00:03:15.310> a<00:03:15.670> map<00:03:15.909> of<00:03:16.150> the<00:03:16.510> location

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
already have a map of the location

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.420 
already have a map of the location
that's<00:03:17.049> and<00:03:17.379> so<00:03:17.530> it<00:03:17.680> has<00:03:17.799> to<00:03:17.920> create<00:03:18.099> this<00:03:18.250> on

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
that's and so it has to create this on

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.339 
that's and so it has to create this on
the<00:03:18.519> fly<00:03:18.730> while<00:03:19.269> also<00:03:19.690> figuring<00:03:20.019> out<00:03:20.080> where<00:03:20.230> it

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
the fly while also figuring out where it

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:22.860 
the fly while also figuring out where it
is<00:03:20.379> in<00:03:20.560> this<00:03:20.890> map<00:03:21.129> and<00:03:21.819> so<00:03:22.060> as<00:03:22.330> it<00:03:22.599> moves<00:03:22.780> around

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
is in this map and so as it moves around

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.050 
is in this map and so as it moves around
in<00:03:23.110> environment<00:03:23.560> it's<00:03:23.680> generating<00:03:24.099> maps<00:03:24.310> and

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
in environment it's generating maps and

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.720 
in environment it's generating maps and
this<00:03:25.209> map<00:03:25.390> here<00:03:25.690> white<00:03:26.080> pixels<00:03:26.560> are<00:03:26.799> what<00:03:27.640> are

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
this map here white pixels are what are

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.780 
this map here white pixels are what are
known<00:03:27.760> often<00:03:28.750> known<00:03:29.140> to<00:03:29.349> be<00:03:29.470> free<00:03:30.190> or<00:03:30.400> obstacle

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
known often known to be free or obstacle

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.000 
known often known to be free or obstacle
free<00:03:31.000> black<00:03:31.989> locations<00:03:32.470> are<00:03:32.620> actual

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
free black locations are actual

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.449 
free black locations are actual
obstacles<00:03:33.459> and<00:03:33.610> then<00:03:34.180> gray<00:03:34.599> locations<00:03:35.110> are

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
obstacles and then gray locations are

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.449 
obstacles and then gray locations are
unknown<00:03:36.459> locations<00:03:37.079> this<00:03:38.079> is<00:03:38.140> a<00:03:38.260> table<00:03:39.250> and

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
unknown locations this is a table and

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.880 
unknown locations this is a table and
our<00:03:40.209> project<00:03:40.720> is<00:03:40.840> basically<00:03:41.049> implementing<00:03:41.799> a

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
our project is basically implementing a

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.490 
our project is basically implementing a
multi-user<00:03:42.370> applications<00:03:43.269> let's<00:03:43.989> say<00:03:44.170> we<00:03:44.379> are

multi-user applications let's say we are

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.160 
multi-user applications let's say we are
doing<00:03:44.920> a<00:03:45.099> design<00:03:45.430> meeting<00:03:46.239> and<00:03:46.660> we<00:03:46.840> want<00:03:47.019> to

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
doing a design meeting and we want to

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.660 
doing a design meeting and we want to
sort<00:03:47.349> through<00:03:47.470> all<00:03:47.530> the<00:03:47.799> design<00:03:48.099> alternatives

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
sort through all the design alternatives

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.759 
sort through all the design alternatives
if<00:03:49.239> I'm<00:03:49.359> a<00:03:49.480> product<00:03:49.780> manager<00:03:49.930> sometimes<00:03:50.680> I

if I'm a product manager sometimes I

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.470 
if I'm a product manager sometimes I
might<00:03:50.920> say<00:03:51.160> it<00:03:51.340> okay<00:03:51.700> you<00:03:51.970> know<00:03:52.060> what<00:03:52.239> I<00:03:52.390> don't

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
might say it okay you know what I don't

are called pairings we can have a
cooling<00:04:21.000> system<00:04:21.120> where<00:04:21.480> you<00:04:21.570> have<00:04:21.750> your

will<00:04:25.500> turn<00:04:25.680> your<00:04:25.830> fat<00:04:26.040> off<00:04:26.250> if<00:04:26.520> it's<00:04:26.880> really

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
will turn your fat off if it's really

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.950 
will turn your fat off if it's really
hot<00:04:27.300> in<00:04:27.419> your<00:04:27.570> room

so<00:04:37.100> what<00:04:38.100> we<00:04:38.280> are<00:04:38.310> doing<00:04:38.639> is<00:04:39.060> modeling<00:04:39.780> the

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
so what we are doing is modeling the

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.379 
so what we are doing is modeling the
cardiovascular<00:04:40.740> system<00:04:40.770> and<00:04:41.310> we<00:04:42.240> use

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
cardiovascular system and we use

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:44.900 
cardiovascular system and we use
transmission<00:04:43.260> lines<00:04:43.470> for<00:04:43.950> modeling<00:04:44.310> but

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
transmission lines for modeling but

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.450 
transmission lines for modeling but
using<00:04:45.419> our<00:04:45.510> circuit<00:04:46.050> elements<00:04:46.560> which<00:04:47.220> we<00:04:47.370> have

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
using our circuit elements which we have

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.480 
using our circuit elements which we have
designed<00:04:47.850> we<00:04:48.630> basically<00:04:49.260> have<00:04:50.040> been<00:04:50.220> able<00:04:50.340> to

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
designed we basically have been able to

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.150 
designed we basically have been able to
figure<00:04:51.030> out<00:04:51.210> what<00:04:52.080> is<00:04:52.229> the<00:04:52.350> pressure<00:04:52.530> pattern

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
figure out what is the pressure pattern

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.510 
figure out what is the pressure pattern
along<00:04:54.000> in<00:04:54.450> the<00:04:54.740> cardiovascular<00:04:55.740> system<00:04:55.770> what

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
along in the cardiovascular system what

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.340 
along in the cardiovascular system what
words<00:04:56.880> mean<00:04:57.030> we<00:04:57.270> have<00:04:57.479> the<00:04:57.630> heart<00:04:57.870> over<00:04:58.020> here

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
words mean we have the heart over here

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.860 
words mean we have the heart over here
so<00:04:58.560> heart<00:04:58.830> is<00:04:59.060> pumping<00:05:00.060> and<00:05:00.510> that<00:05:00.690> this

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
so heart is pumping and that this

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.040 
so heart is pumping and that this
pressure<00:05:01.500> propagates<00:05:02.370> down<00:05:02.880> the<00:05:03.090> vessels<00:05:03.780> if

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
pressure propagates down the vessels if

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.930 
pressure propagates down the vessels if
you<00:05:04.680> use<00:05:05.520> the<00:05:05.930> MATLAB<00:05:06.930> it<00:05:07.350> would<00:05:07.800> say<00:05:08.010> they<00:05:08.520> two

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
you use the MATLAB it would say they two

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.110 
you use the MATLAB it would say they two
