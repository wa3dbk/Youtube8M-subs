00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.840
 Surely each of you faced 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:17.100
 situation faced by now I 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:20.210
 pike stands at some distance in the thick 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.519
 open reeds 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:27.840
 quit flatly refuses to 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:30.300
 such a situation can only lure 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.870
 either throw some bait either 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.500
 without hooks or on the offset hook there 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.610
 directly into the reed but now 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.680
 emptiness of reeds do not do this 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.500
 allow therefore fish from there you can 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.469
 just lure out and for that i'm going 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.170
 use this one wobbler eyes which 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.170
 He proved himself very well 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.010
 in such situations it's megabass vision

 100 posting speed and intensity 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.859
 jerking this choice is reminiscent of jackson 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.280
 dead float 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.589
 but otherwise these baits are different to 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.900
 same grandfather fleet lure silent a

 called for its noise attracts 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.170
 attention predator with very significant 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.550
 distances 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.860
 the need for this usually arises 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.530
 when a predator has to lure without 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.920
 shelters for example from dense thickets 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.620
 flooded reeds 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.950
 the report immediately shows that the german to 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:42.570
 acoustic she noticed about five meters

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.119
 very visible 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:08.810
 hungry on the physique can be seen that 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:11.800
 but the pike did not eat dinner is not necessary and maybe 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.800
 didn't even have breakfast
