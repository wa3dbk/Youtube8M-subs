to<00:00:26.789> depend<00:00:27.150> on<00:00:27.359> him<00:00:27.449> right<00:00:27.539> away<00:00:27.840> because<00:00:28.769> he's

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
to depend on him right away because he's

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.939 
to depend on him right away because he's
got<00:00:29.220> about<00:00:29.519> three<00:00:30.510> weeks<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:31.140> work<00:00:31.349> things<00:00:31.650> out

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949

got about three weeks to work things out
here<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.399> think<00:00:33.090> they<00:00:33.210> should<00:00:33.420> play<00:00:33.630> him

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
here I think they should play him

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.100 
here I think they should play him
against<00:00:33.989> Kansas<00:00:34.469> City<00:00:34.790> let<00:00:35.790> him<00:00:36.090> get<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.780> feel

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
against Kansas City let him get a feel

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.900 
against Kansas City let him get a feel
for<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.469> then<00:00:37.649> he<00:00:37.739> can<00:00:37.860> use<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.309> tape<00:00:38.640> during

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
for it then he can use that tape during

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.260 
for it then he can use that tape during
their<00:00:39.149> bye<00:00:39.329> week<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:40.320> make<00:00:40.860> some<00:00:41.100> adjustments

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
their bye week to make some adjustments

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.540 
their bye week to make some adjustments
then<00:00:42.270> bye<00:00:43.020> week<00:00:43.320> rest<00:00:43.710> up<00:00:43.950> learn<00:00:44.219> more<00:00:44.250> about

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
then bye week rest up learn more about

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.310 
then bye week rest up learn more about
the<00:00:44.820> offense<00:00:45.180> then<00:00:45.390> they<00:00:45.480> play<00:00:45.660> Denver<00:00:46.140> I

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
the offense then they play Denver I

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.850 
the offense then they play Denver I
think<00:00:46.920> by<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.160> time<00:00:47.250> after<00:00:48.239> three<00:00:48.420> weeks<00:00:48.860> by

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
think by the time after three weeks by

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.979 
think by the time after three weeks by
that<00:00:50.010> time<00:00:50.250> his<00:00:50.430> body<00:00:50.850> will<00:00:51.210> be<00:00:51.360> back<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.870> where

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
that time his body will be back to where

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.779 
that time his body will be back to where
he<00:00:52.199> needs<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.739> be<00:00:52.770> he'll<00:00:53.100> essentially<00:00:53.610> have

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
he needs it to be he'll essentially have

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.970 
he needs it to be he'll essentially have
gone<00:00:54.030> through<00:00:54.449> kind<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:55.020> mini<00:00:55.530> training
