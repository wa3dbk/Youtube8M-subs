00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 fine ice and freddie 4 finally has 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.859
 been officially announced with the 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.990
 exit of the trailer in the channel 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.420
 escorts today we are going to analyze what is 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.240
 go in this trailer and give some theories 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.490
 of my own harvest of what they can 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.970
 mean this and how it will develop 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.029
 this game 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:25.060
 first we see the phrase that is what you 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:27.009
 you think you see next you can 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.349
 See someone turn on and off 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:32.199
 incessantly a flashlight in the 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:34.870
 hallway it should be clarified that the design of the 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:39.450
 house that is illuminating you is pretty 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:42.450
 old with an air as of the 90 80 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.600
 then we see the phrase which game 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.010
 you think you're playing as if the 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.010
 the question was making a 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.740
 child again we can see that the person 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.900
 continues lighting the hallway but in a 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.540
 occasion that turns on the lantern it 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.900
 can see that something is going backwards and 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:04.640
 takes refuge in the shadows and is nothing more and 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.640
 nothing less in nike on the pony 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:11.700
 and a new prayer becomes present that 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.580
 is what you brought home then you 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.980
 can see that the person illuminates a 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.380
 room not any room the 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.750
 a child's room because there is 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.210
 enough toys and some accessories 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.670
 stuck on the wall although there is something that 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.740
 it attracted my attention some 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.870
 of toys like the robot that you see 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.060
 in the lower right corner as well as 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.820
 some little stars stuck in the 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.090
 wall and a fan that there is on the 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.340
 sideboard are purple above all 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.190
 in the case of the fan it is quite 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.550
 unusual that it be so in addition to that the 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.540
 fan has always been something 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.180
 characteristic of deliveries 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.250
 previous we did not always have one of 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.070
 that old guy in our offices 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.870
 close the doors again the 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.680
 protagonist illuminates the corridor 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:04.750
 only to run into maynor girl 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.729
 then he goes back to the 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.009
 toys room closes 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.830
 door as it was warned before 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.230
 then look back and we can see 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.360
 the hallway that looked at the last 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.610
 Image upload on the scott page 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.550
 when he turns on the light immediately 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.500
 in an almost supernatural way the 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.560
 spirit tracksuit doll climbs on the 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.890
 chair at the end of the hall 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.660
 check the closet the protagonist goes to 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.060
 closet in the room when 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.910
 it illuminates you can see that it is boxing or 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.569
 rather its nightmare version is 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.670
 waiting watch your back you can see 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.160
 the bed in the same room which 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.769
 It is filled with one mini sinister 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.690
 fredys the same shown in the 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.190
 first image that was announced of this 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.349
 game 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.480
 after that the protagonist turns 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:57.519
 alarmed realizing that something has 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.799
 entered the room decides to go to 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:04.380
 check the hallway but when you turn on 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:04.380
 the light is attacked by night marathon 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.260
 theories about how the gameplay of 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.180
 this game 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.660
 this game called attention for being 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.580
 I think the first game that is not 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.440
 handled at a control point of a 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.260
 security guards room but in 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.600
 a room not any addiction the 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.760
 a child's room probably the 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.530
 objective of the game will be to monitor 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.720
 Doors of the child's room 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.730
 which go to the corridors one by which 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.130
 can come girl and the other one by which 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.470
 can come for something already very classic 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:39.380
 this saga we will also have to monitor a 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.330
 closet from which foxx and al 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.910
 same time we will have to monitor both 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.310
 the bed like a long corridor where 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.440
 is the dummy sprinter or mini 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.560
 version of him that by the way reminded me 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.940
 very much to chucky the diabolical doll 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.250
 possibly the only weapon that we will have 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.740
 to defend ourselves will be our flashlight 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.810
 which we will have to ration and avoid 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.780
 Do not run out of batteries before the 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.160
 dawn but now the important thing comes 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.110
 theories about the plot of this game 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.390
 I think it's pretty clear that 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.160
 this game is going to be very in the past of 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.910
 the previous deliveries of finance and 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.460
 freddie 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.280
 since the design of the whole house has 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.050
 an air like the 90's 80 and I think it's 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.350
 pretty obvious that the protagonist of 

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:23.270
 this game is a boy I do not say 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.550
 only for the children's room 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.770
 but the perspective and angle in the 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.840
 which we are playing is quite low 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.210
 so the protagonist is 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.950
 inclined or has short stature and I 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.290
 I bet more for the second 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.660
 but because the nine came this was 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.400
 home for what was mentioned in the last 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.720
 image on the scott page 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.760
 curse I come to this home 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.790
 probably by the spiky doll 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:50.220
 after terrible things arrive in packages 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.770
 small and the only small thing that we can 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.840
 see in this game is the doll itself 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.930
 sprinter that it is possible for children 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.030
 hallucinations caused by the 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.220
 sprinter doll torturing the child 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.810
 during the nights and at this point I know 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.210
 that many of you will already be 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.490
 thinking but yes I firmly believe that 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:12.950
 the protagonist of this game is going to be 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.950
 the purple man when he was a boy
