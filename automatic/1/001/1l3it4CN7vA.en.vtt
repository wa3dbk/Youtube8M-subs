00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.490 
the top rank they were cut a little bit
shorter<00:02:35.760> than<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.660> hair<00:02:36.930> at<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.140> bottom<00:02:37.290> of

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
shorter than the hair at the bottom of

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.059 
shorter than the hair at the bottom of
those<00:02:38.390> can<00:02:39.390> still<00:02:40.020> be<00:02:40.140> a<00:02:40.170> bit<00:02:40.380> longer<00:02:40.560> if<00:02:40.950> I've

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
those can still be a bit longer if I've

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:50.780 
those can still be a bit longer if I've
done<00:02:41.190> it<00:02:41.250> wrong

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:57.449 

and<00:02:51.330> this<00:02:51.510> has<00:02:51.690> only<00:02:51.900> shown<00:02:52.019> them<00:02:52.530> too<00:02:53.069> long

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.699 

don't<00:02:58.349> try<00:02:59.349> not<00:02:59.560> to<00:02:59.769> use<00:02:59.950> a<00:03:01.319> one-state<00:03:02.319> direct

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
don't try not to use a one-state direct

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.130 
don't try not to use a one-state direct
cut<00:03:02.920> because<00:03:03.099> I<00:03:03.250> know<00:03:03.400> if<00:03:03.730> you<00:03:03.969> obviously<00:03:04.900> just

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
cut because I know if you obviously just

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.830 
cut because I know if you obviously just
a<00:03:05.260> straight<00:03:05.590> line<00:03:05.620> right<00:03:06.150> I<00:03:07.150> want<00:03:07.569> to<00:03:07.629> keep

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
a straight line right I want to keep

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.039 
a straight line right I want to keep
just<00:03:08.290> trimming<00:03:08.709> it<00:03:08.890> down<00:03:08.920> I<00:03:09.599> just<00:03:10.599> still<00:03:10.900> not

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
just trimming it down I just still not

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:44.890 
just trimming it down I just still not
how<00:03:11.230> when<00:03:11.439> it<00:03:11.530> affect<00:03:11.859> me

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.350 

that's<00:03:45.470> not<00:03:45.650> even<00:03:46.209> here

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
that's not even here

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.399 
that's not even here
okay

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:53.409 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:04:00.910 

okay<00:03:56.709> right<00:03:57.709> now<00:03:58.989> that's<00:03:59.989> a<00:04:00.110> lot<00:04:00.500> shorter<00:04:00.739> than

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
okay right now that's a lot shorter than

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:01.619 
okay right now that's a lot shorter than
it<00:04:01.129> was

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:01.629 
it was

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:04.720 
it was
I'm<00:04:02.629> gonna<00:04:02.780> show<00:04:03.019> you<00:04:03.079> what<00:04:03.260> my<00:04:03.379> ghd's<00:04:03.950> how<00:04:04.670> you

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
I'm gonna show you what my ghd's how you

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.089 
I'm gonna show you what my ghd's how you
can<00:04:05.209> just<00:04:05.930> curl<00:04:06.170> it<00:04:06.379> to<00:04:06.530> make<00:04:06.680> it<00:04:06.860> look<00:04:06.980> a<00:04:07.069> bit

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.099 
can just curl it to make it look a bit

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:10.000 
can just curl it to make it look a bit
more<00:04:07.250> like<00:04:07.489> a<00:04:07.879> nicer<00:04:08.269> shape<00:04:08.659> and<00:04:09.379> I<00:04:09.500> usually<00:04:09.680> do

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
more like a nicer shape and I usually do

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.979 
more like a nicer shape and I usually do
this<00:04:10.190> and<00:04:10.489> it<00:04:10.610> makes<00:04:11.030> it<00:04:11.180> sure<00:04:11.480> that<00:04:11.510> at<00:04:11.959> the

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
this and it makes it sure that at the

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.259 
this and it makes it sure that at the
end<00:04:12.110> or<00:04:12.409> that<00:04:12.459> say<00:04:13.459> if<00:04:13.519> you<00:04:13.730> just<00:04:13.879> got<00:04:14.150> your

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
end or that say if you just got your

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.529 
end or that say if you just got your
finish<00:04:14.510> like<00:04:14.659> that<00:04:14.690> I<00:04:16.090> usually<00:04:17.090> take<00:04:17.479> the

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539 
finish like that I usually take the

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:22.870 
finish like that I usually take the
first<00:04:18.340> the<00:04:19.340> front<00:04:19.579> back<00:04:19.820> and<00:04:21.520> just<00:04:22.520> slowly

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
first the front back and just slowly

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.529 
first the front back and just slowly
just<00:04:23.330> curl<00:04:23.539> it<00:04:23.720> around<00:04:23.780> a<00:04:24.110> bit

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:29.539 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:35.559 

they<00:04:30.539> say<00:04:30.960> without<00:04:31.139> a<00:04:31.289> little

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:35.569 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:44.159 

and<00:04:36.569> then<00:04:36.660> separate<00:04:37.020> it<00:04:37.050> out<00:04:37.229> with<00:04:37.380> it

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:46.549 

yeah

00:04:46.549 --> 00:04:46.559 
yeah

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:51.240 
yeah
a<00:04:46.589> bit<00:04:47.459> straighter<00:04:47.729> but<00:04:48.029> um

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.850 

there's<00:04:51.790> much<00:04:52.090> sure<00:04:52.360> to<00:04:52.720> finish<00:04:53.230> or<00:04:53.560> buyers

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
there's much sure to finish or buyers

00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:00.570 
there's much sure to finish or buyers
assume<00:04:54.490> that<00:04:54.670> component<00:04:59.250> thinking<00:05:00.250> it's<00:05:00.370> not

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
assume that component thinking it's not

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.760 
assume that component thinking it's not
better<00:05:00.790> than<00:05:01.060> like<00:05:01.390> it<00:05:02.050> could<00:05:02.350> just<00:05:02.500> burn

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
better than like it could just burn

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.650 
better than like it could just burn
across<00:05:03.280> my<00:05:03.430> face<00:05:03.580> and<00:05:04.240> you<00:05:04.330> never<00:05:04.420> see<00:05:04.630> it

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
across my face and you never see it

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.860 
across my face and you never see it
because<00:05:05.440> I<00:05:05.470> hide<00:05:05.980> it<00:05:06.130> away<00:05:06.570> if<00:05:07.570> you've<00:05:07.690> got<00:05:07.780> you

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
because I hide it away if you've got you

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.260 
because I hide it away if you've got you
