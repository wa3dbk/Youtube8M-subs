00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.870
 hello jean michel goudard osteopath 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.730
 and head of a school of osteopathy 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.519
 but also I propose courses of 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.510
 training and introduction to stretching 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.699
 for the horse for the rider and to 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.490
 massages so today I think you 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.560
 suggest a tip that I discovered 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.300
 by treating horses especially on 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.199
 the very nervous horses that are rather 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.960
 shows with ulcer tendencies to a 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.059
 service thomas nervousness and especially 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.570
 it was when I was looking after horses 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.180
 running 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.980
 regularly I got used to 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.780
 grab the language and realize 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.430
 that he was going to hijack a lot then 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.829
 I will explain to you how to 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.430
 do so to take the language you 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.930
 see here there is a place in the bar where there is 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.559
 not in so it's easy to be able 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.510
 put your fingers 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.360
 from here I will catch the 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.289
 tongue with your fingers and I come out the 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.129
 language 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.020
 but you have to be very careful 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.500
 because an alarm if horse gives a 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.350
 big shot 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.970
 we can get to stretch very very hard 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.840
 the language until the argsz and that's 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.420
 not very good for him 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.580
 so we will take the language and the 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.680
 lock with the same hand on the bed 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.450
 paul from there even though given a 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.340
 headbutt has no risk for the 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.290
 language so no risk either for 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.210
 to make a fracture of the wet bone and there 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.320
 it becomes very interesting and look 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.430
 well what I'm doing is in the process of 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.680
 do he is doing a 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.560
 gymnastics at the level of the jaw and 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.790
 that's going to relax him to relax him 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.030
 a lot and he's going to start 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.360
 chew to salivate and make a 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.979
 gymnastics that will relax 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.500
 the jaw joint of the two 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.790
 sides and that it can even go up to 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.799
 his first three union 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.960
 so that's a test it's some 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.549
 thing that I advocate widely for 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.439
 all the very nervous horses and the 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.869
 shows that have stomach ulcers so 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.140
 thirty seconds on one side and then I 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.140
 released 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:01.280
 and after I come back on the other side 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.280
 here 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.289
 so do not be violent quiet and 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.119
 I always hold with the halter see it 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.190
 like the horse like that makes him do 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.000
 a lot of stretching and a lot of 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.730
 mechanics and it's going to have an action of 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.739
 really very important relaxation at 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.690
 level of the head of the mouth and 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.410
 first cervicals so here you are 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.360
 have read how to relax 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.730
 a horse and especially his mouth and his 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.520
 cervical but watch out 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.690
 always the tongue with the halter is 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.240
 the only way not to be 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.450
 dangerous for the horse and papou to 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.450
 soon
