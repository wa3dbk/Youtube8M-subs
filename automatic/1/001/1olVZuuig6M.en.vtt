 Hernandez and I will explain how is 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.390
 composed the chord family also 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.350
 ok tie then this goes from the next 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.900
 way on this day do it in this role 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.000
 although it becomes clearer and you can 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.730
 pause the video and write it down on your 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.210
 own paper in the sands and there it is 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.610
 my study already I study 13 we do 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.890
 edition recording mix battery 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.910
 you know we make it a very price 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.080
 cheap 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.090
 you just have to write to my mail 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.320
 electronic and send your mix and we can 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:16.170
 qualify or ask for its production as taste 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.560
 that there is this theme families of chords 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.290
 here it is 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.329
 first let's think everyone knows the 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.610
 scale of two greatest naturalness is the 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:27.590
 popular soul do re my fa sun has been 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:32.539
 truth is taught with you a little boy 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:35.750
 first ok so it says we must understand 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.830
 that the notes have a degree if we are going to 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.289
 the scale for example scale that 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.030
 mentions the draft has a degree 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:43.970
 degrees are measured by number for example 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:48.289
 if we use scale of 22 is the first 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.270
 minority the number one is grade 12 is 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.159
 The first one is that the families of 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.759
 chord of 2 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:58.399
 ok if on the scale not here but in the 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:02.659
 scale that I mentioned two the first in the 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:04.969
 second and in the third and fourth is 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.429
 the fifth that is the family with these 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:10.160
 forms so taken by the first of the 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:12.440
 root that is what is the first we are 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.450
 taking out the family of 2 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.240
 the second r agreed that we are going to give for 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.030
 to form a finger family is sun that is 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.660
 the fifth finger the third chord of the 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.060
 minor that is the sixth finger in this case 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.250
 the sixth we put it lower because it was 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.800
 talking about chords and to fit in 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.110
 the family must be less as 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.190
 family always in a younger child because the 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:39.270
 help from minors 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:42.720
 in the fourth the chord goes in 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:46.440
 family of 29 minor who is this one who is 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.570
 here pointing with my finger in the second 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.390
 there is the second minor of we endow 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:55.319
 remember we are the family of 2 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:58.379
 and my minor is the third 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.819
 since the chord family is 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:01.409
 formed by the following if you do not 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.510
 He understood the above he will understand 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:07.920
 now that the local family is formed 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:10.859
 for the first the fifth the sixth minor 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.829
 if it's not smaller, it's going to sound like 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:15.120
 fourth the second minor and the third 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:17.310
 minor I'll do that calm 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.680
 the three are the most important thing of all 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.049
 this video a family of the thing is 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.930
 formed by the first the fifth the 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:27.090
 sixth minor which is the second hand 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:32.069
 the third minor for you make up 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:33.959
 a song you choose the pattern that 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.430
 will use for example within the 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.159
 same family as the first line that 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.169
 we see here the two you want to create a 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:42.000
 song the 2 boat you can catch all that 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:44.099
 that they are there, I want you to be able to 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.680
 put two or three or four and with those 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:48.480
 four do it in the role of cults 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.699
 carlos in the order that you prefer and 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.019
 out there I'm starting and that's the 

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:54.810
 early principles first for 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.639
 compose a good song if I eat it 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.139
 I personally do that others who 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:00.659
 they are seeing what the family of each 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:01.919
 one of the chords the first line that 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:05.280
 It is below the number of those lines 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:08.069
 there is the family of two the family of 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.430
 chords of network that line is already and so 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:13.229
 successively my fa sun if there is 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.239
 the family of each of them is my 

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:16.590
 email write me subscribe 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.169

 another instrument learn only from memory 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.419
 is the chords family of each one what 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:35.550
 more basic although there is some question 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:39.510
 yachts to get dressed
