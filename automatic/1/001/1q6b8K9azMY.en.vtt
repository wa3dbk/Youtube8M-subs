00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.620 
triangles in the Golden Spiral let's say
you<00:02:07.580> didn't<00:02:07.790> like<00:02:07.820> your<00:02:08.060> orientation<00:02:08.390> to

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
you didn't like your orientation to

you didn't like your orientation to
Golden<00:02:08.900> Spiral<00:02:09.200> hit<00:02:10.010> shift<00:02:10.400> oh<00:02:10.670> it<00:02:11.540> will

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
Golden Spiral hit shift oh it will

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.450 
Golden Spiral hit shift oh it will
rotate<00:02:12.380> for<00:02:12.860> you<00:02:14.290> excellent<00:02:15.290> let's<00:02:15.980> go<00:02:16.160> back

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
rotate for you excellent let's go back

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.390 
rotate for you excellent let's go back
hitting<00:02:16.940> Oh<00:02:17.180> some<00:02:17.630> more<00:02:17.840> and<00:02:18.100> i'm<00:02:19.100> going<00:02:19.250> to<00:02:19.310> go

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
hitting Oh some more and i'm going to go

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.220 
hitting Oh some more and i'm going to go
to<00:02:19.490> the<00:02:19.670> triangles<00:02:20.210> one<00:02:20.870> change<00:02:21.080> my

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
to the triangles one change my

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.740 
to the triangles one change my
orientation<00:02:21.560> there<00:02:22.180> once<00:02:23.180> again<00:02:23.360> it's<00:02:23.540> shift

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
orientation there once again it's shift

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:30.550 
orientation there once again it's shift
oh<00:02:24.670> very<00:02:25.670> simple<00:02:26.890> now<00:02:27.890> personally<00:02:28.310> I<00:02:28.910> like<00:02:29.560> to

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
oh very simple now personally I like to

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.790 
oh very simple now personally I like to
work<00:02:30.770> with<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.160> golden<00:02:31.460> ratio<00:02:32.260> so<00:02:33.260> i'm<00:02:33.620> going

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
work with the golden ratio so i'm going

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.310 
work with the golden ratio so i'm going
to<00:02:33.890> hold<00:02:34.130> down<00:02:34.250> my<00:02:34.370> alt<00:02:34.760> key<00:02:35.090> i'm<00:02:35.990> going<00:02:36.230> to

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
to hold down my alt key i'm going to

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.200 
to hold down my alt key i'm going to
zoom<00:02:36.350> in<00:02:38.800> going<00:02:39.800> to<00:02:39.890> drag<00:02:40.280> my<00:02:40.550> image<00:02:40.820> until<00:02:41.090> i

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
zoom in going to drag my image until i

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.850 
zoom in going to drag my image until i
get<00:02:41.270> in<00:02:41.480> a<00:02:41.570> position<00:02:41.780> that<00:02:42.140> I<00:02:42.260> like<00:02:42.590> that<00:02:42.620> I

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
get in a position that I like that I

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.890 
get in a position that I like that I
feel<00:02:42.920> appropriate<00:02:43.400> as<00:02:43.880> you<00:02:44.060> see<00:02:44.300> I'm<00:02:44.480> using<00:02:44.510> my

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
feel appropriate as you see I'm using my

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.140 
feel appropriate as you see I'm using my
grid<00:02:45.320> and<00:02:46.190> I'll<00:02:46.460> think<00:02:46.670> of<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:46.820> grid<00:02:47.030> is

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
grid and I'll think of the grid is

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.800 
grid and I'll think of the grid is
nothing<00:02:47.450> more<00:02:47.570> than<00:02:47.720> a<00:02:47.780> mask<00:02:48.080> and<00:02:48.970> if<00:02:49.970> I'm<00:02:50.480> done

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
nothing more than a mask and if I'm done

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.540 
nothing more than a mask and if I'm done
and<00:02:51.200> I'm<00:02:51.320> happy<00:02:51.680> with<00:02:51.800> things<00:02:51.950> i<00:02:52.250> can<00:02:52.400> double

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
and I'm happy with things i can double

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.010 
and I'm happy with things i can double
click<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:53.000> image<00:02:53.180> or<00:02:53.300> i<00:02:53.390> can<00:02:53.450> just<00:02:53.600> hit<00:02:53.900> the

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
click the image or i can just hit the

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.980 
click the image or i can just hit the
enter<00:02:54.320> key<00:02:56.080> bingo<00:02:57.080> crops<00:02:57.740> done<00:02:58.100> looks<00:02:58.640> good

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
enter key bingo crops done looks good

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.810 
enter key bingo crops done looks good
alright<00:02:59.990> so<00:03:00.440> i<00:03:00.470> hope<00:03:00.800> you<00:03:00.920> enjoyed<00:03:01.250> this<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:01.670> I
