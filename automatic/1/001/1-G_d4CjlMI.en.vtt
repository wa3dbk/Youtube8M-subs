00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
washed and screened like I doubt that it

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.160 
washed and screened like I doubt that it
actually<00:03:04.680> works<00:03:05.330> it<00:03:06.330> works<00:03:06.600> might<00:03:06.840> one<00:03:07.050> of

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
actually works it works might one of

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.310 
actually works it works might one of
ones<00:03:07.380> a<00:03:07.500> people<00:03:08.040> person<00:03:08.280> I<00:03:08.460> know<00:03:08.720> uses<00:03:09.720> a<00:03:09.750> sand

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
ones a people person I know uses a sand

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.030 
ones a people person I know uses a sand
of<00:03:10.470> it<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:11.370> it's<00:03:12.330> fine<00:03:12.570> so<00:03:12.960> I<00:03:12.990> figured<00:03:13.500> why<00:03:13.650> not

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
of it and it's fine so I figured why not

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.190 
of it and it's fine so I figured why not
and<00:03:14.130> send<00:03:14.850> I<00:03:15.120> feel<00:03:15.420> is<00:03:15.570> better<00:03:15.720> than<00:03:15.900> gravel

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
and send I feel is better than gravel

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:23.320 
and send I feel is better than gravel
because<00:03:16.350> it<00:03:16.440> doesn't<00:03:16.710> chat<00:03:16.890> poop<00:03:17.810> so<00:03:18.810> yeah

next bucket

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.610 
next bucket
make<00:04:14.600> sure<00:04:14.750> the<00:04:14.870> hose<00:04:15.050> doesn't<00:04:15.320> fall<00:04:15.590> down

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
make sure the hose doesn't fall down

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.580 
make sure the hose doesn't fall down
soon<00:04:16.209> so<00:04:17.209> I<00:04:17.450> think<00:04:17.510> the<00:04:17.810> buck<00:04:17.959> with<00:04:18.109> Jamie<00:04:18.320> put

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
soon so I think the buck with Jamie put

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:31.050 
soon so I think the buck with Jamie put
it<00:04:18.680> there<00:04:18.940> someone<00:04:19.940> fill<00:04:20.120> up<00:04:20.209> the<00:04:20.299> next<00:04:20.510> bucket

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:54.280 

sake<00:04:32.060> look<00:04:32.240> easier<00:04:32.630> when<00:04:32.780> I<00:04:32.840> start

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.470 

mix<00:04:55.290> it<00:04:55.380> around<00:04:55.440> again<00:04:56.060> now<00:04:57.060> the<00:04:57.120> water<00:04:57.360> is

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
mix it around again now the water is

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.540 
mix it around again now the water is
getting<00:04:57.630> much<00:04:57.900> clearer<00:04:58.260> this<00:04:58.889> is<00:04:59.100> good

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
getting much clearer this is good

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.570
