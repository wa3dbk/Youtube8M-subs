 logo the term logo comes from Greek 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.710

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.850
 visual representation of the brand formed 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.700
 both by the logo and the symbol 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.040
 the term logo is the junction of words 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.399
 from Greek logos meaning the word 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.520

 of letters with the choice of a 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.780
 typography in which companies and 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.610
 organizations are readily 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.760
 recognized by customers 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.160
 that is the written part of the logo without 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.390
 accompanying a symbol as the name 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.949

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.189
 one of the elements of visual identity 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.470
 which can be part of a logo, it can 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.840
 be abstract or figurative and

 help identify a brand 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.560
 separating the others, making it unique and 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.580
 such as the symbol of the 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.799

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.460
 frequently be used if 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.280
 referring to the meaning of the term 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.619
 logo carries with it a certain 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.110
 controversy among professionals in the 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.049
 areas of advertising marketing and design 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.420
 graphic as both the word logos that 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:46.200
