00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 the return game is difficult because 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.180
 the use of your house is strong 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.900
 strong is playing well general of 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.880
 I play well but I do it 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.650
 however, I think he did well in 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.740
 take out some and thinking about the game 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.770
 he remains a fundamental country player 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.050
 and it seems to me that the return game 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.060
 of course the advantage goes by 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.619
 result for what the tournament did for 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.720
 what at this moment we see him from 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.630
 blue cross packaging but you can not 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.860
 rule out what they are going to face 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:37.340
 match just that you just have to 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.340
 come to win 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:50.190
 the first time a pair of goals I have 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.649
 soul regardless of what of what 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.180
 working crown which shows crown 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.180
 they lose a match no heart 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.120
 the great game of balls those plays the 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.500
 neon guy from the past tournament that said 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.869
 paranoid with the movement of voice I would 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.899
 quito abides and left him the leader so that 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.899
 the part with which is absurd 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.560
 the ass I'll remove decides to raze 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.080
 he has removed it and it is rare that the goal and 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.280
 finish the german levels with z yo 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.530
 I understand that lion made it to the final 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.659
 minute 2l short wash that had 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.369
 liberators but the goal and is 24 years old 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.170
 it will be necessary for you to think 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.060
 but only in Mexican soccer 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.759
 we see European football that now looks 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.009
 much more than they have 80 or 90 matches 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.960
 a year and play to the fullest is true 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.729
 I'm comparing pears and apples but 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.729
 but this more physical why 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:54.049
 24 years is true in the month of April 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.049
 true, do not be exhausted 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.090
 an advantage that represents 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.340
 for the lion to play always at night 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.960
 night matches that you tear only 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.520
 help 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.930
 is not the lion of before playing the 12 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.780
 but in the comparison that you said 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:15.000
 example seeing the requirement not because 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.490
 be a champions semifinal but what 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.320
 that we have seen football in europe 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.900
 lately yes but but the player 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.020
 he is also educated and he is worked and 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:33.680
 is committed to that and for that 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:35.790
 demand the most powerful powers and 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.220
 resistance the Mexican player always 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.720
 has been resilient but if you notice the 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.730
 fatigue in several of those who played the 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.730
 end of the last tournament of america 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:51.110
 suddenly no no no no no 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.110
 mentally that commitment 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.440
 and the athletic one of madrid the changes that 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.870
 to simeone or how it starts from a game to 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.940
 another and of course you have no doubt 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.300
 that the position is fought in each 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.300
 training
