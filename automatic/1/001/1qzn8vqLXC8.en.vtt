00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 Hello everyone new review today yes 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.420
 this is a review you have me 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.670
 required a lot, namely that of 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.190
 new cosmetics snow blade 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.809
 Duochrome this many otherwise it was 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.470
 sent by snow and I already had it 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.750
 shown both in the video yes of the video 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.640
 some birthday presents and I have you 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.100
 also made me prepare with you why 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.400
 it drives me crazy anyway I go with 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.859
 order costs 33 euros and 90 e to his 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.960
 interior contains all these colors 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.140
 so there are ten colors in the classics 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.760
 I think that big snow cosmetics pods 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:42.870
 that are 3.6 grams 3 grams per ten 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.170
 eyeshadows 3.6 mm in diameter anyway 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.820
 contains all these beautiful colors 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:51.390
 in my opinion and that they have the peculiarity 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.690
 to be precisely composed of a color 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.059
 predominant and within have a 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.370
 pigment of another contrasting color 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.850
 with the preponderant one they create 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.830
 just a duochrome effect then the 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.439
 color that you go to lay does not remain 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.720
 never homogeneous on the eyelid but is a 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.939
 all singer colors are all 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.640
 Some shimmer eye shadows are slightly 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.799
 more dusty than others but really one 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.960
 which you can absolutely do 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.580
 forgive for how beautiful I am in 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.909
 this time I'm wearing one of mine 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.490
 favorite that is this here so this 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.909
 color that has inside the red of the 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.829
 brick and it's called happy but I believe 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.079
 what camcorder as usual with 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.720
 these lights that I have to change do not render 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.750
 well the idea is however I made you of 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.130
 every color swatch on the eyes 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.710
 then in the light of the sun 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.540
 therefore what I show you 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.159
 own the actual color of the 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.380
 eye shadows in the sunlight 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.380
 simply spread with a primer 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.470
 I find that it is really a small spoon 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.450
 fantastic I love it because the 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.610
 I call it my life-saving spoon 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.430
 in the sense that I am going to choose a color 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.380
 I apply it by myself and it still seems that 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.780
 I was there to work the make-up a 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.650
 make nuances to create games 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.510
 of light 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.820
 actually when in reality anyway I have 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.430
 simply applied a single color 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:10.280
 nor beyond that I like very much e 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.770
 that I always use one is precisely a phoenix that 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.040
 is what I wear the other is this 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:19.460
 here called poison poison yes 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:22.070
 poison practically this green with 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:25.190
 inside of purple reflections but also 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:27.350
 browns is a perfect color to pull 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.600
 out of our brown eyes 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.480
 green shades in fact is what I have 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.700
 used in I prepare with you and it is 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.590
 what i'm using more in 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.270
 absolute of the whole palette because 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.150
 I really find it makes you come 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.280
 brighter eyes more seen and another 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.800
 this crazy color is me here 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.220
 which is practically called haunted apple 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:52.880
 and it is a violet that in this case has 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:55.220
 inside reflections on the green on 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.590
 brownish also a brownish purple with 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.200
 some reflections on the green this here 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.410
 according to me is once stretched is very 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.450
 similar to the eyeshadow club of max but in 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.090
 general all the shovel in my opinion 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.600
 this philosophy follows a little, that is, that 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.640
 to be able to apply a single eye shadow but 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.830
 still have a result as if it were 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.630
 a super elaborate trick was done 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.700
 I must say that in fact lately I am 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.590
 using a lot even in the morning that 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.360
 I usually try to go to work 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.370
 don't load too much makeup because you don't 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.230
 I have time this solved for me a 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.870
 lots of problems because it's practically 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:32.210
 change color every day by putting a 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.090
 just eye shadow and the thing I do is 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.730
 just apply it with the brush 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.980
 flat over the entire eyelid and then it 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.720
 pick up just a pin on the brush 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.970
 from shades I go to spread it 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.220
 simply in the fold of the eye is 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.040
 that alone is enough to create a 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.470
 a super causative result like that 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.480
 that even today it seems that I have 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.920
 applied a lot of eye shadows with a 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.690
 lot of nuances 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.030
 actually I only applied one 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.680
 purely if I had to say is a palette 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.500
 that would absolutely recommend the 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:06.140
 if they hadn't sent it to me for sure 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:09.050
 I would have tried it anyway because of me 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:11.450
 all these products that are gods 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.850
 multi-use products or otherwise perform 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.100
 different functions save my life and me 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.350
 they always attract so much the colors become 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:21.230
 even more beautiful if helped by wet and 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:24.920
 they become really super shiny and super 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:27.350
 simerini are almost metallic do 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:30.290
 this beautiful effect an effect 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:32.660
 wet and when you wet them you are 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:35.840
 even more iridescent though I usually 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:38.180
 I use them dry because I prefer to keep 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.669
 the wet effect for the evening or for the 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.740
 a little more special occasions not 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:44.720
 I know for the office they seem to me too 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.850
 however intense in general is one 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.919
 palette according to me highly recommended e 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.960
 which I think you will see me really use 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:53.120
 so much because I really like it 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.490
 that is, those lifesaving palettes that 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.440
 I'd take them anywhere they don't comment here 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.090
 below if viva let me know if this 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.980
 palette in the air pulls if you already have it 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.300
 if in short I don't care 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.340
 anything 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.500
 anyway let me know everything with a 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:09.110
 comment below if not forgotten 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.270
 I write something in the info box e 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:14.120
 I hope I have been useful to you with this 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:16.010
