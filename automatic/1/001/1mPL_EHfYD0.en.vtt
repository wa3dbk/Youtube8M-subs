00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.350 
the garden actually I've always wanted
to<00:03:24.360> have<00:03:24.510> like<00:03:24.689> a<00:03:24.750> sister<00:03:25.260> like<00:03:26.090> my<00:03:27.090> brother

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
to have like a sister like my brother

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.330 
to have like a sister like my brother
was<00:03:27.510> definitely<00:03:27.900> a<00:03:27.930> protective<00:03:28.409> brother<00:03:28.590> so

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
was definitely a protective brother so

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.190 
was definitely a protective brother so
that<00:03:29.790> was<00:03:29.879> kind<00:03:30.120> of<00:03:30.150> annoying<00:03:30.269> but<00:03:30.840> I<00:03:30.870> think<00:03:31.079> if

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
that was kind of annoying but I think if

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.050 
that was kind of annoying but I think if
I<00:03:31.379> had<00:03:31.560> a<00:03:31.590> sister<00:03:31.829> older<00:03:32.430> or<00:03:32.549> younger<00:03:32.700> I<00:03:32.909> think

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
I had a sister older or younger I think

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.490 
I had a sister older or younger I think
I<00:03:33.239> would<00:03:33.390> be<00:03:33.540> like<00:03:33.689> the<00:03:33.810> more<00:03:33.989> protective

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
I would be like the more protective

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.649 
I would be like the more protective
sister<00:03:34.920> but<00:03:35.280> she<00:03:35.489> would<00:03:35.730> definitely<00:03:35.879> be<00:03:36.390> the

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:36.659 
sister but she would definitely be the

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:40.789 
sister but she would definitely be the
bitch<00:03:37.670> my<00:03:38.689> making<00:03:39.689> me<00:03:39.780> feel<00:03:39.930> so<00:03:40.140> agent<00:03:40.590> with<00:03:40.680> my
