00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.910 
there notice my elbows are sticking out
a<00:00:45.270> little<00:00:45.360> bit<00:00:45.660> at<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.809> back<00:00:45.960> my<00:00:46.530> hands<00:00:46.770> are

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
a little bit at the back my hands are

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.170 
a little bit at the back my hands are
sticking<00:00:47.219> out<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.370> little<00:00:47.460> bit<00:00:47.730> at<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.910> front

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
sticking out a little bit at the front

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.889 
sticking out a little bit at the front
and<00:00:48.649> we<00:00:49.649> do<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.010> velcro<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.820> attach<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.570> arms

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
and we do the velcro to attach the arms

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.000 
and we do the velcro to attach the arms
to<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.199> body<00:00:52.489> so<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.730> we<00:00:53.910> can<00:00:54.410> isolate<00:00:55.410> that

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
to the body so that we can isolate that

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.369 
to the body so that we can isolate that
torso<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.239> torso<00:00:57.629> can<00:00:57.840> move<00:00:58.140> in

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
torso so that the torso can move in

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.110 
torso so that the torso can move in
unison<00:00:58.590> with<00:00:59.010> what<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.340> pelvis<00:00:59.520> tells<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.090> to

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
unison with what the pelvis tells it to

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.360 
unison with what the pelvis tells it to
do<00:01:00.480> because<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.260> pelvis<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.770> reacting<00:01:02.250> to

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
do because the pelvis is reacting to

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.920 
do because the pelvis is reacting to
what<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.640> feet<00:01:02.789> are<00:01:02.940> doing<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.570> let<00:01:03.719> me<00:01:03.780> give
