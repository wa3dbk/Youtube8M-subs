crunk<00:00:02.700> our<00:00:02.939> greenhouse<00:00:03.360> manager<00:00:03.810> and<00:00:04.049> today

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
crunk our greenhouse manager and today

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.019 
crunk our greenhouse manager and today
we're<00:00:04.470> going<00:00:04.500> to<00:00:04.620> learn<00:00:04.799> how<00:00:04.859> we<00:00:05.130> seed<00:00:05.730> and

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
we're going to learn how we seed and

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:29.529 
we're going to learn how we seed and
fill<00:00:06.540> our<00:00:06.810> greenhouses

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.840 

you

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.740 

so<00:00:33.780> this<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.050> our<00:00:34.199> seed<00:00:34.410> machine<00:00:35.300> we<00:00:36.300> start<00:00:36.600> out

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
so this is our seed machine we start out

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.149 
so this is our seed machine we start out
today<00:00:37.170> we're<00:00:37.530> seating<00:00:38.120> celeriac<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:40.159> 192

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:41.159 
today we're seating celeriac in 192

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:49.319 
today we're seating celeriac in 192
trays<00:00:41.730> so<00:00:42.629> there's<00:00:42.809> 192<00:00:43.620> cells<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:44.159> the<00:00:44.250> tray

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.920 

it's<00:00:50.329> filled<00:00:50.629> with<00:00:50.719> dirt<00:00:51.579> comes<00:00:52.579> down<00:00:52.940> the

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
it's filled with dirt comes down the

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.060 
it's filled with dirt comes down the
line<00:00:54.140> it<00:00:54.769> gets<00:00:55.390> double<00:00:56.390> dip<00:00:56.570> it<00:00:56.809> puts<00:00:57.620> holes<00:00:57.800> in

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
line it gets double dip it puts holes in

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.400 
line it gets double dip it puts holes in
the<00:00:58.280> in<00:00:58.910> the<00:00:58.969> tray<00:01:01.089> then<00:01:02.089> I<00:01:02.329> take<00:01:02.570> the<00:01:02.629> seed<00:01:03.050> and

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
the in the tray then I take the seed and

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.670 
the in the tray then I take the seed and
today<00:01:04.129> it's<00:01:04.280> really<00:01:04.489> tiny<00:01:04.850> seed<00:01:05.380> spread<00:01:06.380> it<00:01:06.530> on

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
today it's really tiny seed spread it on

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.300 
today it's really tiny seed spread it on
our<00:01:07.330> seed<00:01:08.330> tray<00:01:08.630> which<00:01:08.840> the<00:01:09.470> seeds<00:01:09.740> are<00:01:09.890> being

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
our seed tray which the seeds are being

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.960 
our seed tray which the seeds are being
vacuumed<00:01:10.820> onto<00:01:11.149> the<00:01:11.270> tray<00:01:11.540> so<00:01:12.409> I'm<00:01:12.530> going<00:01:12.680> to

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
vacuumed onto the tray so I'm going to

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:24.560 
vacuumed onto the tray so I'm going to
turn<00:01:13.970> this<00:01:14.180> on

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.530 

a<00:01:24.740> lot<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.770> times<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.370> seeds<00:01:26.700> get<00:01:27.060> sucked<00:01:27.330> on

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
a lot of times to seeds get sucked on

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.330 
a lot of times to seeds get sucked on
together<00:01:27.870> so<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.200> got<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.500> try<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.710> separate<00:01:29.159> it

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
together so I got to try to separate it

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.910 
together so I got to try to separate it
because<00:01:29.490> we<00:01:29.640> don't<00:01:29.820> want<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.300> seeds<00:01:30.690> in<00:01:31.470> the

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
because we don't want to seeds in the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.460 
because we don't want to seeds in the
each<00:01:32.760> cell<00:01:33.120> and<00:01:33.660> then<00:01:33.780> they're<00:01:33.930> competing<00:01:34.260> for

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
each cell and then they're competing for

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.820 
each cell and then they're competing for
the<00:01:35.340> soil<00:01:35.580> and<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:35.970> nutrients<00:01:36.650> it<00:01:37.650> gets

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
the soil and the nutrients it gets

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.700 
the soil and the nutrients it gets
whipped<00:01:38.130> over<00:01:38.720> the<00:01:39.720> seeds<00:01:40.020> are<00:01:40.170> will<00:01:40.320> then<00:01:40.500> go

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
whipped over the seeds are will then go

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.460 
whipped over the seeds are will then go
down<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.190> tube<00:01:41.460> into<00:01:42.000> each<00:01:42.390> pole<00:01:42.869> into<00:01:43.260> each

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
down the tube into each pole into each

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:56.719 
down the tube into each pole into each
cell<00:01:52.340> then<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.520> continues<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.920> gets<00:01:55.920> covered

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
cell then it continues and gets covered

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.790 
cell then it continues and gets covered
with<00:01:56.910> vermiculite<00:01:57.330> which<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.350> kind<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.649> like<00:01:58.740> a

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
with vermiculite which is kind of like a

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.719 
with vermiculite which is kind of like a
blanket<00:01:59.369> over<00:01:59.610> the<00:02:00.360> seeds<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:02.310> holds<00:02:02.490> the

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
blanket over the seeds and it holds the

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.080 
blanket over the seeds and it holds the
moisture<00:02:02.910> when<00:02:03.660> we<00:02:03.810> water<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.140> that's<00:02:04.680> how<00:02:04.890> the

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
moisture when we water it that's how the

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:20.180 
moisture when we water it that's how the
seed<00:02:06.090> machine<00:02:06.420> works

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.820 

so<00:02:20.520> here<00:02:20.670> we<00:02:20.760> are<00:02:20.970> in<00:02:21.000> greenhouse<00:02:21.450> for<00:02:21.750> we<00:02:22.620> have

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
so here we are in greenhouse for we have

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.180 
so here we are in greenhouse for we have
for<00:02:23.610> greenhouses<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.510> this<00:02:25.020> is<00:02:25.170> how<00:02:25.320> we<00:02:25.860> lay

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
for greenhouses and this is how we lay

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.220 
for greenhouses and this is how we lay
out<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.550> trays<00:02:26.820> what<00:02:27.570> we<00:02:27.690> were<00:02:27.780> seeding<00:02:28.140> in

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
out the trays what we were seeding in

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.810 
out the trays what we were seeding in
the<00:02:28.530> sea<00:02:28.710> Durham<00:02:28.980> were<00:02:29.840> was<00:02:30.840> celeriac<00:02:31.680> in<00:02:31.920> 91

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
the sea Durham were was celeriac in 91

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.670 
the sea Durham were was celeriac in 91
92<00:02:33.270> cell<00:02:33.780> trays<00:02:34.410> here<00:02:35.250> we're<00:02:35.520> doing<00:02:35.760> we've<00:02:36.150> got

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
92 cell trays here we're doing we've got

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.390 
92 cell trays here we're doing we've got
kale<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:38.070> these<00:02:38.550> are<00:02:38.760> 310<00:02:39.720> cell<00:02:40.230> trays<00:02:40.560> so

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
kale and these are 310 cell trays so

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.840 
kale and these are 310 cell trays so
there's<00:02:41.580> 310<00:02:42.270> plants<00:02:42.780> in<00:02:42.990> this<00:02:43.230> tray<00:02:43.640> we<00:02:44.640> like

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
there's 310 plants in this tray we like

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.630 
there's 310 plants in this tray we like
to<00:02:45.000> keep<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.450> tab<00:02:45.810> on<00:02:45.840> what<00:02:46.320> was<00:02:47.130> planted<00:02:47.610> there

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
to keep a tab on what was planted there

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.820 
to keep a tab on what was planted there
so<00:02:47.970> we<00:02:48.090> know<00:02:48.270> what<00:02:48.930> we're<00:02:49.080> transplanting<00:02:49.740> in

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
so we know what we're transplanting in

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.590 
so we know what we're transplanting in
the<00:02:49.890> field<00:02:50.100> we<00:02:50.340> also<00:02:50.490> write<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.940> date<00:02:51.120> this

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
the field we also write the date this

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.590 
the field we also write the date this
kale<00:02:52.350> was<00:02:52.650> seated<00:02:53.130> on<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.370> fourth<00:02:53.640> so<00:02:54.300> about

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
kale was seated on the fourth so about

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.090 
kale was seated on the fourth so about
two<00:02:55.260> weeks<00:02:55.410> ago<00:02:56.300> it'll<00:02:57.300> be<00:02:57.420> in<00:02:57.720> here<00:02:58.100> probably

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
two weeks ago it'll be in here probably

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.030 
two weeks ago it'll be in here probably
another<00:02:59.570> three<00:03:00.570> or<00:03:00.600> four<00:03:00.930> weeks<00:03:01.110> until<00:03:01.590> it's

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
another three or four weeks until it's

another three or four weeks until it's
ready<00:03:02.190> to<00:03:02.430> be<00:03:02.460> transplanted<00:03:02.970> out<00:03:03.270> in<00:03:03.390> the

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
ready to be transplanted out in the

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.870 
ready to be transplanted out in the

this<00:03:12.710> March<00:03:13.040> has<00:03:13.220> been<00:03:13.370> a<00:03:13.400> little<00:03:13.550> bit<00:03:13.730> unusual

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
this March has been a little bit unusual

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.840 
this March has been a little bit unusual
here<00:03:15.080> in<00:03:15.260> Washington<00:03:15.860> the<00:03:16.460> weather<00:03:16.670> was

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
here in Washington the weather was

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.180 
here in Washington the weather was
little<00:03:17.180> colder<00:03:17.540> because<00:03:18.050> this<00:03:18.410> is<00:03:18.590> the<00:03:18.770> one

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
little colder because this is the one

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.280 
little colder because this is the one

don't have any diseases sometimes all
the<00:04:18.970> plants<00:04:19.359> don't<00:04:19.570> need<00:04:19.810> to<00:04:19.870> be<00:04:19.989> watered<00:04:20.200> we

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
the plants don't need to be watered we

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.700 
the plants don't need to be watered we
often<00:04:21.280> in<00:04:21.579> our<00:04:21.790> greenhouses<00:04:22.230> the<00:04:23.230> plants<00:04:23.590> on

often in our greenhouses the plants on

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.830 
often in our greenhouses the plants on
the<00:04:23.830> outer<00:04:23.950> edges<00:04:24.250> get<00:04:25.000> drier<00:04:25.300> than<00:04:25.570> the<00:04:25.630> ones

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
the outer edges get drier than the ones

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.960 
the outer edges get drier than the ones
in<00:04:25.990> the<00:04:26.110> middle<00:04:26.350> so<00:04:26.650> they<00:04:27.250> just<00:04:27.280> need<00:04:27.729> to<00:04:27.760> be

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
in the middle so they just need to be

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.840 
in the middle so they just need to be
hand<00:04:28.300> watered<00:04:28.690> if<00:04:28.960> you<00:04:29.950> do<00:04:30.130> water<00:04:30.400> them<00:04:30.490> too

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
hand watered if you do water them too

hand watered if you do water them too
much<00:04:31.000> they<00:04:31.060> can<00:04:31.360> get<00:04:31.660> moldy<00:04:32.110> we<00:04:32.470> have<00:04:32.590> problems

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
much they can get moldy we have problems

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.250 
much they can get moldy we have problems
with<00:04:33.070> downy<00:04:33.340> mildew<00:04:33.600> so<00:04:34.600> you<00:04:34.660> need<00:04:34.900> to<00:04:34.990> find<00:04:35.110> a

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
with downy mildew so you need to find a

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.620
