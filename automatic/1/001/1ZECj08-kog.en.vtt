smaller how to explain this I start with

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.710 
smaller how to explain this I start with
the<00:01:42.060> slots<00:01:43.070> which<00:01:44.070> begins<00:01:44.460> with<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.850> Express

the HP 625 estimates screen which i
think<00:03:20.670> is<00:03:20.970> better<00:03:21.180> on<00:03:21.500> the<00:03:22.500> keyboards<00:03:22.950> are

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
think is better on the keyboards are

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.800 
think is better on the keyboards are
even<00:03:23.459> similar<00:03:24.080> not<00:03:25.080> very<00:03:25.380> weak<00:03:25.790> but<00:03:26.790> also<00:03:27.390> not

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
even similar not very weak but also not

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:34.039 
even similar not very weak but also not
very<00:03:27.840> nicely<00:03:30.500> set<00:03:32.030> there<00:03:33.030> are<00:03:33.209> some<00:03:33.540> special

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
very nicely set there are some special

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.949 
very nicely set there are some special
function<00:03:34.709> keys<00:03:35.600> especially<00:03:36.600> here<00:03:36.750> on<00:03:36.930> the

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
HP is 625 you will just change the

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.039 
HP is 625 you will just change the
output<00:03:59.310> of<00:03:59.340> the<00:03:59.610> speakers<00:04:00.030> and<00:04:00.269> you<00:04:00.840> don't

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
output of the speakers and you don't

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.990 
output of the speakers and you don't
have<00:04:01.230> that<00:04:01.410> a<00:04:01.739> red<00:04:02.040> letter<00:04:02.519> written<00:04:02.820> in

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
have that a red letter written in

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.380 
have that a red letter written in
capitals<00:04:03.600> then<00:04:04.340> but<00:04:05.340> on<00:04:05.640> the<00:04:05.880> presario<00:04:06.510> its

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
capitals then but on the presario its

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.240 
capitals then but on the presario its
when<00:04:09.390> you<00:04:09.540> accidentally<00:04:10.230> hit<00:04:10.950> the<00:04:11.370> left<00:04:11.549> keys

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
when you accidentally hit the left keys

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.430 
when you accidentally hit the left keys
it<00:04:14.250> happens<00:04:14.640> that<00:04:14.940> the<00:04:15.510> printer<00:04:16.019> interface

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
it happens that the printer interface

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.690 
it happens that the printer interface
interface<00:04:17.250> opens<00:04:18.000> or<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:19.620> calculator<00:04:20.220> pops

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
interface opens or the calculator pops

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.910 
interface opens or the calculator pops
up<00:04:20.940> which<00:04:21.870> is<00:04:22.140> more<00:04:22.560> way<00:04:23.130> more<00:04:24.740> disturbing

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
up which is more way more disturbing

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.250 
up which is more way more disturbing
then<00:04:27.710> the<00:04:28.710> audio<00:04:29.370> outputs<00:04:29.910> function<00:04:30.510> keys<00:04:30.780> of

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
then the audio outputs function keys of

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.660 
then the audio outputs function keys of
on<00:04:32.160> the<00:04:32.400> HP<00:04:32.610> 625<00:04:33.510> so<00:04:34.410> one<00:04:34.650> advantage<00:04:34.980> point

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
on the HP 625 so one advantage point

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.530 
on the HP 625 so one advantage point
more<00:04:36.050> for<00:04:37.050> the<00:04:37.260> HP<00:04:38.060> another<00:04:39.060> difference

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
more for the HP another difference

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.160 
more for the HP another difference
belongs<00:04:39.870> to<00:04:40.140> the<00:04:40.290> touchpad<00:04:40.500> which<00:04:41.490> is<00:04:41.520> a<00:04:41.700> bit

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.170 
belongs to the touchpad which is a bit

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:47.600 
belongs to the touchpad which is a bit
bigger<00:04:43.170> on<00:04:43.650> the<00:04:44.490> presario<00:04:45.860> the<00:04:46.860> keys<00:04:47.070> could<00:04:47.400> be

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
bigger on the presario the keys could be

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.930 
bigger on the presario the keys could be
a<00:04:47.880> bit<00:04:48.090> harder<00:04:48.810> but<00:04:49.800> I<00:04:50.160> don't<00:04:50.340> mind<00:04:50.550> that<00:04:50.790> much

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
a bit harder but I don't mind that much

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.050 
a bit harder but I don't mind that much
because<00:04:51.210> I<00:04:51.630> use<00:04:51.870> this<00:04:52.620> tipping<00:04:53.190> tipping<00:04:53.490> click

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
because I use this tipping tipping click

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.850 
because I use this tipping tipping click
function<00:04:54.660> normally<00:04:54.870> one<00:04:55.500> of<00:04:55.620> the<00:04:55.710> most

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
function normally one of the most

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.850 
function normally one of the most
important<00:04:56.340> differences<00:04:56.970> which<00:04:57.270> is<00:04:57.860> very

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
important differences which is very

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.850 
important differences which is very
important<00:04:59.310> for<00:04:59.340> the<00:05:00.060> usability<00:05:00.570> of<00:05:00.870> notebook

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
important for the usability of notebook

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
important for the usability of notebook
belongs<00:05:02.640> to<00:05:03.150> the<00:05:03.660> touchpad<00:05:04.110> as<00:05:04.260> well<00:05:04.880> the

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
belongs to the touchpad as well the

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.030 
belongs to the touchpad as well the
difference<00:05:05.910> is<00:05:06.390> here<00:05:06.600> that<00:05:07.160> the<00:05:08.160> HPA<00:05:08.700> 6:25

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
difference is here that the HPA 6:25

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.610 
difference is here that the HPA 6:25
touchpad<00:05:11.040> and<00:05:11.730> yes<00:05:12.570> it<00:05:12.720> is<00:05:12.840> a<00:05:12.960> little<00:05:13.080> smaller

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
touchpad and yes it is a little smaller

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.120 
touchpad and yes it is a little smaller
but<00:05:13.950> I<00:05:14.220> think<00:05:15.050> and<00:05:16.050> I<00:05:16.140> am<00:05:16.290> big<00:05:16.470> enough<00:05:16.740> for

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
but I think and I am big enough for

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.440 
but I think and I am big enough for
normal<00:05:17.310> hands<00:05:18.350> it<00:05:19.350> has<00:05:19.440> a<00:05:19.560> multi-touch

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
normal hands it has a multi-touch

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.900 
normal hands it has a multi-touch
function<00:05:21.450> and<00:05:21.690> so<00:05:22.110> it<00:05:22.470> you<00:05:23.040> can<00:05:23.220> scroll<00:05:23.520> with

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
function and so it you can scroll with

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.290 
function and so it you can scroll with
two<00:05:24.240> fingers<00:05:24.510> through<00:05:25.170> websites<00:05:25.410> or<00:05:26.300> use

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
two fingers through websites or use

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.230 
two fingers through websites or use
special<00:05:27.750> functions<00:05:28.490> when<00:05:29.490> you<00:05:29.640> click<00:05:30.060> with

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
special functions when you click with

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.620 
special functions when you click with
three<00:05:30.570> fingers<00:05:30.810> or<00:05:31.290> do<00:05:32.160> other<00:05:32.520> guest<00:05:32.970> use<00:05:33.180> um

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
three fingers or do other guest use um

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.260 
three fingers or do other guest use um
all<00:05:34.470> this<00:05:35.070> is<00:05:35.250> not<00:05:35.430> possible<00:05:35.640> on<00:05:36.060> the

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
all this is not possible on the

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.800 
all this is not possible on the
Rosario's<00:05:37.550> touchpad<00:05:38.550> because<00:05:39.420> it<00:05:39.600> just

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
Rosario's touchpad because it just

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.160 
Rosario's touchpad because it just
