believe the mid to late 80s I probably

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.010 
believe the mid to late 80s I probably
got<00:00:46.190> this<00:00:46.399> sometime<00:00:46.850> in<00:00:47.000> the<00:00:47.090> early<00:00:47.390> 90s<00:00:47.870> I'm

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
got this sometime in the early 90s I'm

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.780 
got this sometime in the early 90s I'm
sure<00:00:48.260> Kenner<00:00:48.620> did<00:00:48.950> kind<00:00:49.220> of<00:00:49.309> keep<00:00:49.489> a<00:00:49.520> lot<00:00:49.760> of

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
sure Kenner did kind of keep a lot of

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.430 
sure Kenner did kind of keep a lot of
their<00:00:49.940> stuff<00:00:50.239> on<00:00:50.420> the<00:00:50.600> shelves<00:00:51.020> for<00:00:51.079> quite<00:00:51.380> a

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
their stuff on the shelves for quite a

their stuff on the shelves for quite a
while<00:00:51.710> and<00:00:52.309> they<00:00:52.399> weren't<00:00:52.610> directly<00:00:52.940> based

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
while and they weren't directly based

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.880 
while and they weren't directly based
off<00:00:53.360> the<00:00:53.510> movie<00:00:53.809> they're<00:00:53.960> more<00:00:54.170> tied<00:00:54.380> into<00:00:54.620> the

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
off the movie they're more tied into the

little red sticker up here I think it's

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.300

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
is really neat on the top you see the

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.910 
is really neat on the top you see the
trapdoors<00:02:49.490> they<00:02:50.180> are<00:02:50.420> black<00:02:51.260> and<00:02:51.470> white<00:02:51.650> I

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
trapdoors they are black and white I

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.170 
trapdoors they are black and white I
believe<00:02:52.250> this<00:02:52.400> actually<00:02:52.610> supposed<00:02:53.000> to<00:02:53.030> be<00:02:53.120> a

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
believe this actually supposed to be a

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.550 
believe this actually supposed to be a
glow-in-the-dark<00:02:53.390> plastic<00:02:54.260> but<00:02:54.410> mine

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
glow-in-the-dark plastic but mine

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.890 
glow-in-the-dark plastic but mine
doesn't<00:02:54.770> really<00:02:55.070> glow<00:02:55.459> anymore<00:02:56.180> but<00:02:56.870> I

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
doesn't really glow anymore but I

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.690 
doesn't really glow anymore but I
believe<00:02:56.930> it<00:02:57.290> was<00:02:57.470> at<00:02:57.680> one<00:02:57.860> point<00:02:58.100> and<00:02:58.520> then

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
believe it was at one point and then

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.370 
believe it was at one point and then
here<00:02:58.880> off<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.209> back<00:02:59.390> we<00:02:59.660> have<00:02:59.870> this<00:03:00.140> little

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.490 
common to find one of these that
actually<00:03:42.920> still<00:03:43.640> works<00:03:43.910> so<00:03:44.209> the<00:03:45.049> fact<00:03:45.290> that<00:03:45.380> I

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
actually still works so the fact that I

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.920 
actually still works so the fact that I
have<00:03:45.620> a<00:03:45.650> working<00:03:45.980> example<00:03:46.190> of<00:03:47.090> it<00:03:47.239> is<00:03:47.420> kind<00:03:47.870> of

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
have a working example of it is kind of

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.380 
have a working example of it is kind of
cool<00:03:48.080> to<00:03:48.380> me<00:03:48.530> and<00:03:48.799> it<00:03:49.400> works<00:03:49.549> pretty<00:03:49.850> well<00:03:49.970> it

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
cool to me and it works pretty well it

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.060 
cool to me and it works pretty well it
doesn't<00:03:50.540> take<00:03:50.660> a<00:03:50.810> whole<00:03:51.019> lot<00:03:51.080> of<00:03:51.410> force<00:03:51.680> those

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
doesn't take a whole lot of force those

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.789 
doesn't take a whole lot of force those
doors<00:03:52.280> pop<00:03:52.549> right<00:03:52.790> open<00:03:52.989> so<00:03:53.989> that<00:03:54.140> is<00:03:54.350> the<00:03:54.560> Real

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
accurate and well done but for what this

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.820 
accurate and well done but for what this
was<00:04:14.209> a<00:04:14.239> cheap<00:04:14.840> little<00:04:15.049> kid's<00:04:15.410> toy

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
anything like that it does what it does

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.830 
anything like that it does what it does
in<00:04:27.320> the<00:04:27.380> movie<00:04:27.740> it<00:04:27.919> rolls<00:04:28.280> across<00:04:28.430> the<00:04:28.610> floor

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
really can't ask for a whole lot more

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.420 
really can't ask for a whole lot more
than<00:04:34.190> that<00:04:34.220> maybe<00:04:35.030> some<00:04:35.479> lights<00:04:35.750> and

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
than that maybe some lights and

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.330 
than that maybe some lights and
but<00:04:36.880> really<00:04:37.540> it<00:04:37.810> is<00:04:37.870> what<00:04:38.290> it<00:04:38.410> is<00:04:38.560> and<00:04:38.920> I<00:04:39.130> really

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
but really it is what it is and I really

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.610 
but really it is what it is and I really
like<00:04:39.850> this<00:04:40.060> piece<00:04:40.330> now<00:04:41.080> it's<00:04:41.230> hard<00:04:41.380> to

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
like this piece now it's hard to

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.860 
like this piece now it's hard to
actually<00:04:41.970> recommend<00:04:42.970> something<00:04:43.480> like<00:04:43.660> this

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
actually recommend something like this

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.170 
actually recommend something like this
because<00:04:44.170> from<00:04:44.890> what<00:04:45.040> I've<00:04:45.160> seen<00:04:45.490> they're<00:04:45.790> not

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
because from what I've seen they're not

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.570 
because from what I've seen they're not
the<00:04:46.510> easiest<00:04:46.990> to<00:04:47.230> find<00:04:47.260> incomplete<00:04:48.160> working

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
the easiest to find incomplete working

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.940 
the easiest to find incomplete working
order<00:04:48.790> and<00:04:49.210> if<00:04:49.600> you<00:04:49.720> do<00:04:49.870> find<00:04:50.110> them<00:04:50.350> they<00:04:50.410> can

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
order and if you do find them they can

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.610 
order and if you do find them they can
actually<00:04:50.980> carry<00:04:51.580> a<00:04:51.760> fairly<00:04:52.540> hefty<00:04:52.750> price<00:04:53.260> tag

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
actually carry a fairly hefty price tag

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.890 
actually carry a fairly hefty price tag
but<00:04:54.220> if<00:04:54.310> you<00:04:54.370> ever<00:04:54.520> do<00:04:54.730> come<00:04:55.000> across<00:04:55.180> one<00:04:55.630> at<00:04:55.780> a

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
but if you ever do come across one at a

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.810
