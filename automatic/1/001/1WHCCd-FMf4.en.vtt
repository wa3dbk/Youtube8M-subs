00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.459 
upgrade for the one I haven't tried any
of<00:00:38.190> them<00:00:38.520> this<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.210> first<00:00:39.540> time<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:40.200> try

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
of them this is the first time I try

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.970 
of them this is the first time I try
inform<00:00:41.250> or<00:00:41.520> ill<00:00:42.210> maza<00:00:42.570> all<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:43.379> here<00:00:43.710> we<00:00:43.829> go

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
inform or ill maza all so here we go

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.700 
inform or ill maza all so here we go
first<00:00:44.460> up<00:00:44.700> his<00:00:44.910> pace<00:00:45.210> his<00:00:45.750> acceleration<00:00:46.140> is

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
first up his pace his acceleration is

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.860 
first up his pace his acceleration is
pretty<00:00:47.160> slow<00:00:47.489> so<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:48.090> have<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.539> take<00:00:48.719> that

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
pretty slow so you have to take that

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.020 
pretty slow so you have to take that
into<00:00:49.110> consideration<00:00:49.140> if<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.190> are<00:00:50.399> uh<00:00:50.430> if<00:00:50.730> you

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
into consideration if you are uh if you

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.840 
into consideration if you are uh if you
like<00:00:51.239> Pacey<00:00:51.600> plays<00:00:51.989> do<00:00:52.739> not<00:00:52.949> even<00:00:53.190> go<00:00:53.550> for<00:00:53.760> this

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
like Pacey plays do not even go for this

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.200 
like Pacey plays do not even go for this
guy<00:00:54.059> but<00:00:54.570> once<00:00:55.020> he<00:00:55.170> hits<00:00:55.440> his<00:00:55.620> sprint<00:00:55.949> speed

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
guy but once he hits his sprint speed

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.910 
guy but once he hits his sprint speed
he-he's<00:00:57.210> got<00:00:57.390> decent<00:00:57.930> pace<00:00:58.109> he's<00:00:58.350> not<00:00:58.530> slow<00:00:58.770> at

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
he-he's got decent pace he's not slow at

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.560 
he-he's got decent pace he's not slow at
all<00:00:59.100> but<00:00:59.340> once<00:00:59.520> he<00:00:59.699> hits<00:00:59.910> his<00:01:00.059> sprint<00:01:00.390> speed

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
all but once he hits his sprint speed

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.290 
all but once he hits his sprint speed
that<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.170> when<00:01:01.379> he<00:01:01.500> becomes<00:01:01.770> unstoppable<00:01:02.640> and

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
that is when he becomes unstoppable and

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.500 
that is when he becomes unstoppable and
when<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.780> mean<00:01:03.989> unstoppable<00:01:04.769> because<00:01:04.949> he<00:01:05.189> has

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
when I mean unstoppable because he has

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.950 
when I mean unstoppable because he has
96<00:01:07.830> strength<00:01:08.280> which<00:01:08.610> means<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.689> he

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
96 strength which means that he

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.200 
96 strength which means that he
needs<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.830> army<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.580> stop<00:01:11.820> him<00:01:12.000> once

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
needs a army to stop him once

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.450 
needs a army to stop him once
he's<00:01:12.420> in<00:01:12.630> front<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.140> know<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:14.159> will<00:01:14.280> see

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
sort he has perfect work rates for a

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.209 
sort he has perfect work rates for a

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
attacking work rate and defensive is low

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.030 
attacking work rate and defensive is low
so<00:01:59.670> he<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.180> perfect<00:02:00.899> for<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.170> position<00:02:01.530> and

only<00:03:26.460> bad<00:03:26.640> thing<00:03:26.670> I<00:03:26.970> fought<00:03:27.180> about<00:03:27.390> boricuas

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
only bad thing I fought about boricuas

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.560 
only bad thing I fought about boricuas
is<00:03:28.560> his<00:03:28.830> freestyle<00:03:29.550> skills<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:30.030> freestyle

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
is his freestyle skills and freestyle

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.260 
is his freestyle skills and freestyle
weak<00:03:30.780> foot<00:03:31.020> which<00:03:31.470> is<00:03:31.650> pretty<00:03:31.920> bad<00:03:32.790> I<00:03:32.850> guess

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
weak foot which is pretty bad I guess

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.600 
weak foot which is pretty bad I guess
but<00:03:33.600> I<00:03:33.870> don't<00:03:34.260> I<00:03:34.740> as<00:03:35.040> you<00:03:35.160> guys<00:03:35.310> know<00:03:35.460> I<00:03:35.490> don't

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
but I don't I as you guys know I don't

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.390 
but I don't I as you guys know I don't
school<00:03:36.120> much<00:03:36.360> so<00:03:36.660> I<00:03:36.690> found<00:03:37.140> him<00:03:37.290> really<00:03:37.500> fun<00:03:38.220> to

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
school much so I found him really fun to

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.000 
school much so I found him really fun to
use<00:03:38.550> and<00:03:38.790> another<00:03:39.390> thing<00:03:39.630> is<00:03:39.810> his<00:03:40.080> agility<00:03:40.740> is

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
use and another thing is his agility is

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.280 
use and another thing is his agility is
pretty<00:03:41.580> bad<00:03:42.000> so<00:03:42.360> sometimes<00:03:42.900> when<00:03:43.170> you're

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
pretty bad so sometimes when you're

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.020 
pretty bad so sometimes when you're
trying<00:03:43.530> to<00:03:43.620> turn<00:03:43.800> with<00:03:43.980> him<00:03:44.130> he<00:03:44.490> does<00:03:44.760> feel<00:03:45.000> a

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
trying to turn with him he does feel a

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.820 
trying to turn with him he does feel a
bit<00:03:45.150> stiff<00:03:45.750> when<00:03:46.020> you're<00:03:46.140> dribbling<00:03:46.380> with<00:03:46.710> him

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
bit stiff when you're dribbling with him

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.770 
bit stiff when you're dribbling with him
but<00:03:47.220> other<00:03:47.340> than<00:03:47.580> that<00:03:47.640> this<00:03:48.240> guy<00:03:48.540> is

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
but other than that this guy is

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.100 
but other than that this guy is
certainly<00:03:49.470> amazing<00:03:50.460> in<00:03:50.610> my<00:03:50.640> eyes<00:03:51.060> he<00:03:51.630> is<00:03:51.660> one

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
certainly amazing in my eyes he is one

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.990 
certainly amazing in my eyes he is one
of<00:03:52.140> the<00:03:52.350> best<00:03:52.590> players<00:03:52.860> to<00:03:52.950> use<00:03:53.190> obviously

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
of the best players to use obviously

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.820 
of the best players to use obviously
he's<00:03:54.480> not<00:03:54.600> gonna<00:03:54.690> get<00:03:54.870> a<00:03:54.930> perfect<00:03:55.380> ten<00:03:55.560> because

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
he's not gonna get a perfect ten because

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.160 
he's not gonna get a perfect ten because
he<00:03:55.920> did<00:03:56.100> have<00:03:56.280> a<00:03:56.460> couple<00:03:56.850> of<00:03:57.060> bad<00:03:57.270> points<00:03:57.720> but

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
he did have a couple of bad points but

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.780 
he did have a couple of bad points but
other<00:03:58.440> than<00:03:58.560> that<00:03:58.620> I<00:03:59.040> definitely<00:03:59.370> recommend

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
other than that I definitely recommend

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.430 
other than that I definitely recommend
you<00:04:00.000> should<00:04:00.180> try<00:04:00.420> him<00:04:00.600> out<00:04:00.720> because<00:04:01.020> this<00:04:01.200> guy

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
you should try him out because this guy

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.940 
you should try him out because this guy
is<00:04:01.650> so<00:04:02.340> amazing<00:04:03.150> to<00:04:03.180> use<00:04:03.540> if<00:04:03.870> it<00:04:04.410> depends<00:04:04.890> on
