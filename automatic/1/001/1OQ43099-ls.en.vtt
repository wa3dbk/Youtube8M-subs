00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:07.130
 It is clear that the Westerners and Japanese have different muscles. 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:12.050
 It's body is different 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:14.110
 So if you don't do it in a way that suits the Japanese body, Japanese 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:19.750
 Not attached 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:24.509
 On the contrary, if it is done in such a way as to change the number of Japanese traffic jams, which were Japanese, 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.509
 You can change your body faster than Japanese 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.449
 Also out rapidly along with the West it is 10 centimeters, down by 6 weeks so say Ya scale 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.449
 I will 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.760
 I am 40 years old and have a symmetry rate of 7% 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:42.430
 I have been working for over 11 years 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:46.040
 Japanese have less material in the body than Westerners 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:49.930
 So we need a way to advertise it 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:52.020
 That is why Richter that the Japanese get muscles 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.680
 If the cause is known 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:01:00.180
 You will also know how to make it easy to get muscles 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.620
 In the body it does not change There are three points should be changed is 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:08.100
 It is useless if you do not change those three points 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:12.550
 There are ways in which it is difficult for sound effects to appear easily on body files 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:18.340
 It will play time if you do not do it wisely 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:21.970
 Such a method that can not be effective for 10 minutes in 10 minutes time, but can use one time many times 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:26.380
 If you take it , the small black part of the body will be faster 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:31.020
 The first is okay if you start from the movement to use if you can not own body 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.020
 When you exercise, you only care what many people do 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:38.080
 It is important how to actually do it 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:43.120
 In normally is recalled door Ya only will the body changes 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:50.840
 With apc's f thurs, it's more than just doing it 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:56.740
 It is a result and a sentence if it combines c or does in order of cae 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:02:02.300
 Or if dismantling the range to move to the faster speed also effect also dry 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:05.390
 Training I think a much higher effect considering from the point of view of physical 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:09.380
 It's not enough to have a new meal alone 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:15.770
 When eating you must consider the timing because makes one movement 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:18.990
 Then those who succeed are not only this one but also mental control methods 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:22.880
 Italy to their ambitious year but 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.880
 The number is good immediately at the goal 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:29.520
 All I need to do is have such a program that automatically moves in front of me 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.520
 is 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.580
 Interest rate is on 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.290
 After retirement 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.640
 Be cool 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.410
 Can be a confident man 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.910
 If you get the body you want 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.910
 The eyes that people see you change 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:51.530
 The new image I feel unconsciously changes 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.610
 Change is buried in white 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.610
 Life changes
