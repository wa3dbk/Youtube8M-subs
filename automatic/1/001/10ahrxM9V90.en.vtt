00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.889
 very good to all welcome to a 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.330
 new video I'm making 170 and in this 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.160
 I bring you a tutorial of 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.039
 battlefield picture how to put the 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.590
 emblems downloaded from the internet let's say 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.989
 it because those who usually do you 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.330
 let's say manually there tend to be more 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:29.519
 botched in the facts by professionals 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.109
 in quotes for it the first thing that 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.540
 you are going to do is go to the link that is 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.519
 leave the description is this page in 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.140
 lens by battlefield 4 are also worth 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:39.449
 for the hard line when it comes out that 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.079
 still has not come out and it's here the 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:44.699
 url in lens battlefield dotcom and a 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.250
 Once on this page you are going to look for the 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.690
 emblem that you want to put that goes to 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.390
 appear in your gun to your 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.100
 soldiers our vehicle etc. in my 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.570
 case for example I like this one that is 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.609
 of the call of duty 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.900
 Little irony, an emblem of call of duty 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:00.750
 in battlefield 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.940
 and on this page it's worth this he has done 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.980
 any guy before anything else 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.290
 emblems for premium members that are 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.820
 these in which leaves a p that the rest 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.010
 of people can not get because the 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.340
 premium can be put to this emblems 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.870
 of 40 layers but the members that are not 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.360
 premium only emblems of 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.340
 20 then without the crime then upload 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.470
 here above all the height 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.960
 previously all the normalitos leave 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.590
 let's say if you give your premium later 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.640
 that will take the emblem that you want 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.220
 let's take this here you get the 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.680
 layers as you see 40 since I'm premium and 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.030
 here comes the uncle who has made the 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.650
 likes pil have given the comments that 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.930
 they have given him and they give him the instructions 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.240
 I tell you in Spanish in this valley 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.890
 page here below leave you a code 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.760
 ok you have to copy from where 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.500
 Emblem dot point emblem dot loud 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:53.060
 everything up to the bottom here you have it 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.240
 let's copy it in my case I'm in a 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:59.090
 mac in safari command or command c 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.930

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.880
 as always you go to battlefield 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.440
 butterfield battlelog sorry and you have 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.229
 have to be assured of being in the 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.270
 Battlefield 4 page and this one leave it 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.140
 in 3 and a half the area then you go to 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.140
 battlefield 4 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.030
 you make the screen that comes out once 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.010
 that you have logged in we started from 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.629
 zero to put on the emblem once 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.180
 you have to copy the code you click on 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:27.920
 your profile 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:30.080
 once here you go to soldier load out 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.280
 then you are going to customize the custom 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.069
 eyes 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.430
 emblem 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.800
 once here and here seen my emblems 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.430
 add a new one 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:44.260
 and in my case that is in mac you give 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.299
 rick right to inspect the item 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.489
 in windows I honestly do not know how it is 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.709
 I think it's done with control yes jota or 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:54.040
 something like that I do not know that, it's a matter of 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.209
 search it online or wherever and a 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.159
 once you have the inspection visit to 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.599
 element of inspect all the 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:00.489
 elements of the page as it goes 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.860
 marking what you can customize and 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.480
 that we are going this do not touch it because 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.209
 you can mess it up pretty brown with 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.769
 page you go down to the bottom and you pegÃ¡is 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.720
 PJA code each disk page 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.060
 previous that you have everything copyable 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.269
 you give to inter and now it generates you the 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.980
 emblem for you we close this menu 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:21.280
 you would have what is the emblem for 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.720
 your weapon your soldier rather the 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.400
 isa when saving and using good first thing 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.260
 if you do not like for example this color 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.750
 because it's that color is usually white 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.599
 It's a matter of picking it up here 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.020
 you click and I know how you put it 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:36.740
 this same west 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:39.080
 As you like it, you give it to six years 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:42.110
 save and use 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.780
 carrer battlelog would come emblem 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.190
 saved once you have it here my 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.620
 personal recommendation is that you go 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.090
 to your profile again and if you get 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.490
 here in the background is that it has been updated 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.440
 our emblem correctly and nothing else 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.180
 is a pretty simple trick you have 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.030
 to be alert to if you are premium or if 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.460
 no and do it well with all the steps if 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.020
 It has served you useful leave me a 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:07.510
 like and a favorite is appreciated enough 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.510
 see you in the next video bye bye
