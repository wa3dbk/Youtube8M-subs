00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.970
 to have good health is 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.729
 known that we should consume all kinds 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.190
 of nutrients the meat in particular we 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:12.050
 provides protein but in many cases 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.120
 for certain diseases like 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.160
 may be high blood pressure or 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.960
 high cholesterol becomes necessary 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.300
 decrease protein intake 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.490
 animals so it is essential to know 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.109
 how to replace meat in the diet and 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.119
 so we can continue keeping 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.669
 balance to our body so that 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.619
 not reduce the levels of iron 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.750
 legumes are one of the substitutes for 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.640
 the meat can be made in a large 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.149
 variety of dishes like potajes 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.370
 stews or casseroles cooked 1 the 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:43.579
 lentils are a source of protein but 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.859
 also of vitamin d and minerals 2 the 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.899
 chickpeas do not have as much protein as 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:49.730
 the lentils but on the contrary their 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:53.089
 Iron content is almost three times 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.309
 greater than the meat 3 the beans and 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:58.460
 beans are low in fat and contain 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.620
 high amount of iron and 4 quinoa fiber 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.179
 this seed can supplant the flesh 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.129
 because it contains all the 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:06.229
 essential amino acids with which 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.760
 they build proteins in addition to 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.370
 extra fiber contribution that bree 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.040
 in the diet the nuts as the 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.900
 almonds the nuts the pistachio 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.910
 raisins the apricot or the 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.220
 dates are a great source of proteins 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.350
 minerals and also vitamins can 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.990
 be consumed in combination with vegetables 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.760
 add them to sauces or rice dishes or take them 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.310
 at breakfast along with yogurt or 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.170
 cereals the eggs can also 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.480
 replace the meat and brings many 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.550
 proteins but to avoid provoking 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.650
 problems with cholesterol can be 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.140
 consume only the clear one instead of the yolk 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.300
 the best way to cook is to do it 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.580
 boiled because if we consume it fried no 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.790
 is so healthy can you add to 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.310
 rice salads or cereals have 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.979
 carbohydrates proteins mineral salts 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.920
 and vitamins the most common are rice 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.950
 the oats the wheat the rye the barley and 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.620
 the corn in addition if the cereals are 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.420
 integral retain more nutrients the 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.820
 whole rice has the privilege of 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.310
 be the most protein cereal comparable its 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.580
 contribution to the meat can be prepared 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.890
 in risottos paellas pastas the vegetables 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.690
 there is a great variety of them in the 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.240
 market and can be seasoned 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.770
 make them even more tasty most of 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.020
 fresh vegetables lack the 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.490
 amino acids that contain sulfur so 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.040
 that vegetables should be supplemented 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.680
 with cereals nuts and seeds that 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.510
 allow the deficit to cover the nuts 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.550
 they thus become the complement 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.890
 ideal for bean- based dishes 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.890
 green Brussels sprouts or peas
