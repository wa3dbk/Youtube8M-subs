00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 We love welcome to the tour 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.480
 about the costa deliziosa yes four years 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.770
 long this material was on mine 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.410
 hard disk and by one 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.300
 sequencing would be circumstances 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.650
 that it has become something today, so yes 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.599
 Let's see if you by the way the 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.250
 city ​​then recognizes in the background 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.109
 write times in the comments but 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.180
 Of course we were first 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.980
 line look at the ship 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.630
 you see, weather was not quite like that 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.420
 good that it was back in january or 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.789
 february on a trip 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.740
 from italy to barcelona and again 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.550
 back we see minigolf you can 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.980
 play and now We check the 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:42.480
 Pooldeck to what I am at the stern is the 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.760
 is not covered and there I can 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.590
 for example, use the tools 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.360
 and i can sit on a bench 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.489
 and relax with a bit of a year 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.289
 will google there is also you see he was 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.480
 then not really that day 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.460
 what's going on and so does that again from 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.559
 rear viewed from so you can see the 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.359
 striking costa chimney so that is 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.579
 the main deck is covered 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.790
 so very handy if you are in 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.689
 is colder on the move and if 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.070
 we it again from another page 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.979
 look now we see a big one 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.080
 There are films where synonymous movies 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.710
 For example, be shown in the evening 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:21.630
 yes again the look outside and that is 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:24.400
 the area for children to play 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.890
 and if we go in now that's it 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.810
 the club deliziosa that is the only one 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.660
 pay restaurant on board where I am 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.770
 one extra pay for the menu 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.090
 unfortunately in costa not quite as 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.040
 You can also pass by in many ways 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.230
 see the restaurants are so 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.650
 largely included in the travel price 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.870
 until just this and there you can too 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:47.800
 then take a look in the kitchen 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:49.810
 through those windows in the back what's up 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.850
 of course, also without end and I can 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.140
 There I dance to live music when I do that 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.729
 I would like to find it interesting 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.160
 the laptop seen so they have 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:00.160
 no notes but read more 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.080
 everything from the laptop to drinks 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.119
 are, of course, to be paid as costa 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.410
 being quite attractive drinks packages 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.640
 there is because it pays to times 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.550
 inform and we see here 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.560
 multilingual it is on board so German 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.320
 is also building language among others 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.590
 besides English and Italian 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:19.450
 for example, the gym 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.459
 Usually, basically, to say it is little 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.920
 as almost everywhere you can 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.450
 It would be nice to look out 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.430
 or who has no desire so no 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.769
 watch TV there with the newer 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.580
 the restaurants buffet 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:34.780
 Restaurant yes buffet is only optional 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.310
 so of course you can actually in 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.640
 first line top restaurant go around 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:43.060
 to eat there but you also have 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:45.700
 this slightly heavier variant and yes 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.620
 one looking out to eat up time 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.140
 a matter of taste as the whole thing is 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.060
 but it is 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.380
 the focus now just not on 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.910
 a german audience but on one 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.910
 international audience 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.680
 So it's for the price you pay for 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.470
 the travel that usually pays is it 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.450
 actually quite okay yes that 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.910
 albatrosses is one of the main ones 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.209
 restaurants, and we'll have a look 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.880
 it's the showstep, so to speak 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.950
 as you sit now and then at noon 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.560
 dinner in the evening you have then 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:19.730
 logically a fixed table time with 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.260
 a fixed table and as well as the whole 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.820
 relaxed too because you just can not answer 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.680
 buffet must run this is the atrium 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.440
 with an interesting artwork here 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.670
 we see so yes so yes does 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.030
 I always think of something, of course 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.790
 a lot of space away yes then there is once 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.790
 video slot machines and of course one 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.890
 casino so who wants to do that 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.420
 his money there just in this way and 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.640
 Wise on the ship 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.200
 this is a lounge where you can dance in the evening 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.680
 can and she sees the whole thing in the bright 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.019
 and this is the 4d cinema known 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.640
 from some ii that too where you are 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:55.640
 watching a movie can be with movement 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:59.930
 effect because this is the theater 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:02.360
 very spacious as you can see and yes 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.040
 what is there in the theater with a show 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.329
 Music you never get on one 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.329
 has led cruise ship 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.130
 and what do you do after the show? 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:22.490
 then you go, for example, in the 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.380
 honestly disco go a few 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.390
 pictures hermann you can only guess it 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.340
 the dance floor is in the back right in the 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.110
 background 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.870
 and that's how it looks then yes 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.920
 Here would be an inside cabin next time 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.540
 everything is a bit more detailed 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.770
 Today, I always shoot a lot more 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.090
 It was still on the ships back then 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.950
 different if you like it anyway 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.480
 has a thumb then goes to the food 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.480
 high and bye until next time
