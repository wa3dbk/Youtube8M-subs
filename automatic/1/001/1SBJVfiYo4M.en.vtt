is<00:06:36.660> three<00:06:36.960> at<00:06:37.590> this<00:06:37.710> point<00:06:37.920> let's<00:06:38.160> talk<00:06:38.340> about

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 
is three at this point let's talk about

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.250 
is three at this point let's talk about
the<00:06:38.730> movement<00:06:39.090> of<00:06:39.120> the<00:06:39.270> raid<00:06:39.450> you'll<00:06:39.960> notice

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:40.260 
the movement of the raid you'll notice

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:41.750 
the movement of the raid you'll notice
that<00:06:40.290> I<00:06:40.500> move<00:06:40.770> the<00:06:40.890> way<00:06:41.040> to<00:06:41.100> the<00:06:41.310> right<00:06:41.340> every

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:41.760 
that I move the way to the right every

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.520 
that I move the way to the right every
so<00:06:41.910> often<00:06:42.090> the<00:06:42.540> reason<00:06:42.660> for<00:06:42.990> this<00:06:43.050> is<00:06:43.110> the<00:06:43.350> boss

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:43.530 
so often the reason for this is the boss

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:47.460 
damage for 30 yard radius so I have to

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:48.740
