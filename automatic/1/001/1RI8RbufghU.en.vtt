00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.700
Welcome to this feature reveal of the Netduma
gaming router's device prioritisation tool,

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.190
which allows you to allocate your upload bandwidth
to your favourite devices using a very simple

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.900
interface. Around the edge of this colourful
graph are each of the devices in my home which

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.030
my router automatically detects. By moving
these white circles I'm allocating my upload

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.860
bandwidth to the devices that really matter
to me, to show you just how powerful this

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.020
is, I'm currently playing Halo and using my
laptop to stream my gameplay to Twitch. On

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.410
the top right of your screen you can see my
Twitch stream and in the bottom right of your

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.670
screen is my Netduma network monitor, which
we recently revealed. This is telling me there

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.999
that there are only two devices currently using my upload,
my laptop, shown by the larger blue area on

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:49.530
my network monitor and my Xbox shown by the
pink area. I've got a decent connection, about

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.729
10meg up so you can see that together these
two devices are using around 10-20% of my

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:58.949
overall bandwidth. Now lets imagine that my
house mates start to use my home's internet

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.489
intensively. This is a disaster for me as
it will cause my game to lag as well as impacting

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.710
my stream, to simulate this, I've started
uploads on two other devices. In the bottom

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.280
right corner of your screen, my network monitor
is now showing two additional colours, orange

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.189
and red. This is telling me that my upload
bandwidth is being eaten up by my house mates.

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:21.170
If you look at my Twitch stream at the top
right corner of your screen, it has already

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.909
started to buffer, ruining my viewers experience.
So lets resolve this problem using this device

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.409
prioritisation tool, I am going to allocate
my bandwidth to my two most important devices,

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.719
my laptop and my Xbox. If you look in the
bottom right corner of your screens, the usage

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:44.310
of my two unwanted devices in red and in orange,
has dropped significantly. At the same time,

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.070
my Twitch stream at the top right hand corner
or your screens has returned to normal,

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.369
this tool has therefore optimised my connection to fit
my needs, ensuring my Xbox will not be affected

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.920
by upload congestion and my stream will be
at its best possible quality because no one

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.469
in my house is able to cause it to buffer
or pixelate. Also, any bandwidth I don't actually

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.560
need is given over to my house mates so they're
happy as well, however, if you do wish to

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.599
solely monopolise your connection simply untick
this share excess box, it will probably annoy

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:21.440
your house mates. With that box unticked only
my console and stream can use my upload connection,

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.190
nothing else. In the bottom right corner you
can see that the other devices have dropped

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.610
off my network monitor completely, meaning that
my entire connection is solely dedicated to

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.709
my favourite devices. Now I have used my need
to game stream as my priorities for this demo

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.769
but this concept holds true to anything that
matters to you. For example, you might want

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.230
to prioritise a large YouTube upload over
everything else in your home. For many of

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.930
our testers, they like to allocate all of
their bandwidth to their gaming device to

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.290
ensure its always prioritised. For those of
you on a low bandwidth connection this is

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.519
a brilliant way of protecting your game from
congestion in your home. I deliberately unticked

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.260
my share excess box to show you that 100%
allocation will actually kill off my stream

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.739
as my laptop is now unable to upload. However,
we really recommend you keep sharing your

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.220
excess bandwidth to ensure everyone in your
home is happy. At the moment we've developed

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.049
this feature for your upstream only but we
can harness our unique anti-flood algorithm

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.640
to work on your downstream as well. If you
would like us to do this please give us your

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.439
feedback on Twitter and on Facebook. Also make
sure you head over to our site netduma.com

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:25.019
to learn more about our other features.
