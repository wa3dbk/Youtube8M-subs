00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
but anyway and this is what it looks

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.830 
but anyway and this is what it looks
like<00:01:38.070> an<00:01:38.189> 11<00:01:38.460> person<00:01:38.759> it's<00:01:39.119> comfortable<00:01:39.509> it's

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
like an 11 person it's comfortable it's

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.219 
like an 11 person it's comfortable it's
easy<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.229> move<00:01:40.380> in<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.890> like<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.060> gray<00:01:42.299> it's<00:01:43.049> one

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
easy to move in I like the gray it's one

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.539 
easy to move in I like the gray it's one
of<00:01:43.320> those<00:01:43.409> but<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.680> do<00:01:43.829> have<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.159> accessorize

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
of those but you do have to accessorize

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.480 
of those but you do have to accessorize
with<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.000> neck<00:01:45.149> color<00:01:45.420> too

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
with the neck color too

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.370 
with the neck color too
and<00:01:46.579> obviously<00:01:47.360> it<00:01:47.689> doesn't<00:01:47.869> work<00:01:48.110> in<00:01:48.229> every

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
and obviously it doesn't work in every

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.560 
and obviously it doesn't work in every
coloring<00:01:48.979> I'm<00:01:49.220> lucky<00:01:49.549> I<00:01:49.700> am<00:01:49.790> the<00:01:50.210> people<00:01:50.509> who
