00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
element 3d layer now how about this

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.550 
element 3d layer now how about this
every<00:01:12.420> time<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.630> say<00:01:13.909> iPhone<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:15.150> have<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.960> do<00:01:16.080> 25

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
okay we're in element 3d here we go

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.090 
okay we're in element 3d here we go
now<00:01:24.659> go<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.869> whatever<00:01:25.140> folder<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.619> place<00:01:25.860> the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
now go to whatever folder you place the

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.580 
now go to whatever folder you place the
iPhone<00:01:26.460> in<00:01:26.610> click<00:01:26.880> on<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.060> folder<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.659> here

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
iPhone in click on the folder and here

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.719 
iPhone in click on the folder and here
right<00:01:28.740> away<00:01:28.829> you'll<00:01:29.040> notice<00:01:29.070> we<00:01:29.400> have<00:01:29.430> two

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
right away you'll notice we have two

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.550 
right away you'll notice we have two
different<00:01:29.880> layers<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.360> that's<00:01:30.570> it's<00:01:31.259> kind<00:01:31.500> of

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
different layers and that's it's kind of

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.289 
different layers and that's it's kind of
confusing<00:01:32.009> we<00:01:32.070> had<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.340> do<00:01:32.490> some<00:01:32.700> finagling<00:01:32.970> to

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
confusing we had to do some finagling to

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.350 
confusing we had to do some finagling to
get<00:01:33.420> this<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.720> work<00:01:34.070> on<00:01:35.070> each<00:01:35.430> layer<00:01:36.119> you're

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
get this to work on each layer you're

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.140 
get this to work on each layer you're
only<00:01:36.509> allowed<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.869> use<00:01:37.229> one<00:01:37.670> set<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.790> texture

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
only allowed to use one set of texture

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
only allowed to use one set of texture
mapping<00:01:39.329> options<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.320> in<00:01:40.710> short<00:01:41.869> we<00:01:42.869> needed<00:01:43.079> to

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
mapping options so in short we needed to

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.600 
mapping options so in short we needed to
use<00:01:43.290> two<00:01:43.500> different<00:01:43.649> ones<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.040> get<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.310> images

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
use two different ones to get the images

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.929 
use two different ones to get the images
to<00:01:44.790> apply<00:01:45.060> correctly<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:45.869> we<00:01:45.899> have<00:01:46.229> two<00:01:46.409> layers

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
to apply correctly so we have two layers

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.609 
to apply correctly so we have two layers
it's<00:01:47.939> not<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.090> big<00:01:48.270> deal<00:01:48.420> they<00:01:48.720> will<00:01:48.960> join

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
it's not a big deal they will join

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.010 
it's not a big deal they will join
together<00:01:49.799> once<00:01:50.220> we<00:01:50.369> get<00:01:50.520> out<00:01:50.700> of<00:01:50.729> element<00:01:51.210> when

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020

be great so we got our front we got our
back<00:01:57.350> now<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.409> only<00:01:58.649> thing<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:58.860> got<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.070> do<00:01:59.280> is

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
back now the only thing you got to do is

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.850 
back now the only thing you got to do is
switch<00:01:59.820> one<00:02:00.719> of<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.930> layers<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.469> different

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
switch one of the layers to a different

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.590 
switch one of the layers to a different
grouping<00:02:02.159> number<00:02:02.430> so<00:02:02.850> we'll<00:02:03.000> just<00:02:03.180> switch

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
grouping number so we'll just switch

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.800
