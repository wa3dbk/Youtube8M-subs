00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
and it basically just works like a

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.850 
and it basically just works like a
regular<00:02:24.430> remote<00:02:25.060> would<00:02:25.470> you<00:02:26.470> know<00:02:26.590> anyhow

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
regular remote would you know anyhow

regular remote would you know anyhow
that's<00:02:27.040> okay<00:02:27.340> I<00:02:27.370> sort<00:02:27.640> like<00:02:27.730> a<00:02:27.790> gesture<00:02:28.150> one's

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300

that's okay I sort like a gesture one's
a<00:02:28.450> little<00:02:28.540> bit<00:02:28.720> better<00:02:28.840> I<00:02:28.930> think<00:02:29.140> it's<00:02:29.260> sort<00:02:29.440> of

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
a little bit better I think it's sort of

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.250 
a little bit better I think it's sort of
cool<00:02:29.709> I<00:02:29.950> haven't<00:02:30.819> seen<00:02:31.120> how<00:02:31.330> this<00:02:31.569> works<00:02:32.050> with
