00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:09.240
 says that this bar of cereal and seed 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:10.950
 they are going to walk but 10 fattening points 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.370
 they eat it or it's really good 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.110
 days everyone at home the day are super 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.000
 nutritious but atenti for those who 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.190
 they do sport like a cereal bar 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.529
 caster eats three fried cakes and you go 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.600
 to nap is not for the fall of 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.520
 cereal and to go running to walk to 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.320
 do some activity and get to 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.640
 front before physical activity is 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.859
 prior to physical activity because 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.450
 they have seeds because you have cereals 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.950
 has a little coconut and has a 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.410
 percentage of glucose that is milk 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.960
 condensed that will help you justly 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.450
 to develop the musculature we are going to 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:47.100
 good to welcome you to the kitchen 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:50.670
 can of condensed milk I'll ask you 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.100
 that everything all everything all the idea of ​​this 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.730
 cereal bar is that you eat a 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.920
 medium potter bar to a quiet one with 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.719
 You just have to see what I'm saying 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.699
 while then it warms the 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.089
 arts I'm going to tell you that I have the oven 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.689
 at 180 degrees 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.969
 180 like that since I have oatmeal oats 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:12.399
 rolled is sold in a box 

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:15.340
 all life in grated coconut if 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:18.819
 just me but shredded 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.189
 here you have I have to pass again 

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:23.030
 Here I have raisins but it could be 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.700
 I dont know 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.970
 the arab dates in your house you have 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:32.500
 dried damask and are also expected in 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:35.540
 cubes what is done with cubes the 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:39.369
 Rosa has a remnant of that bread 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.369
 sweet last summer 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.360
 I say that to eat one does not have 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.110
 fat I can not finish the first 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.080
 Awesome 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.250
 and here we have the kind of seeds 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.710
 We have to separate it so that the 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.990
 you see well the green would be separated 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:04.090
 they are also pumpkin seeds that are 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:07.070
 sold in the diet of delicious 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.200
 I'll explain to you later to have seeds of 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.729
 sesame and has sunflower seeds in 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.280
 the known ones that are sold in the 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.280
 kiosk also but these are without salar 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.800
 these little seeds are all in one 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.300
 baked plate 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.130
 the cakes in the oven five minutes and 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.450
 here I have peanuts that are obviously not 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.370
 salty 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.379
 raw and we toast it also in the oven 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.360
 that is, the seeds and the peanuts have 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:40.209
 to be toasted afterwards there's not much 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.209
 more than doing more than dumping the recipe 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.099
 dry tail is that not because the 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.390
 squash comes if you look at the seeds 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.310
 of a pumpkin of any fashion 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.560
 they are white inside that seed 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:03:00.349
 white comes this green seed that 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:02.209
 toyota with coconut oats if we go 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.130
 to put also the raisins here 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.220
 stirring and lowering the fire that does not 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.940
 burn all the seeds and finally 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.160
 the peanut seems that as you will see the 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.230
 people 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.610
 the link that send us rich things and 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.880
 If that is your request, they will give you the 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.310
 pancakes for dessert and then you 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.380
 We send it to friend Daniel Saba, if such 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.570
 it's good as well I'm fine marengo 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.940
 Okay it seems that it does not integrate but 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.830
 is integrated and the idea of ​​heating the 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.080
 condensed milk is to make it more liquid 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.180
 and that these can be better integrated 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.920
 ingredients in this situation where 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.680
 is this what we are going to do now is 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.720
 dump it on a plate that is what 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.570
 has has a base aluminum foil 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.280
 key because if you will not tell me about 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.350
 everything when you want to unmold and do not 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.110
 is going to unmold you good see you joined 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.210
 everything on the plate I have a little if 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.460
 you want to make it healthier this spray 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.140
 that is oil spray and take off and if 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.150
 not clear a little oil 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.940
 then the chaste one without thinking 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.710
 too much and that is not easy and that what 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.780
 you're going to do now it 's because now you have 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.030
 that crush all this with the singing of 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.070
 a spoon and how it has the bulk of a 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.590
 of these bars five days out of the 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.840
 refrigerator in a tightly closed bottle and you 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.390
 it said as it comes in the sweet thing of 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.739
 condensed milk will cost you a lot 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.549
 crush it then I here I have a little 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.530
 of oil 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.199
 with the edge of the spoon I'm going 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.750
 crushing this is going to go to the oven more 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:27.879
 or less 15 minutes until becoming 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.930
 this I have here 15 minutes of oven 

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:30.930
 180 degrees 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.260
 this helps you to good regularity 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.360
 let's say regularize notice that when 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.460
 this you take out of the oven 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.530
 on a hot plate and take out the 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.170
 role in a child in hot everything is in 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.730
 hot is there and to cut it you have to 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.040
 wait for it to cool and look how good 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:05:03.510
 that is cut and how easy that is is you 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:05.160
 let's cut as if they melt but 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.990
 nothing will happen to you when this is 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.720
 cool down again they are going to stay in the 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.360
 place so they melt is good 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.460
 recommended before a performance 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.430
 and totally but do not fit any 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.930
 doubt that this is really good 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.000
 for when the night for example that is 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.320
 something sweet and the average chocolate that you 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.820
 gives the tantrum especially if the 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.920
 milk chocolate and it's not bitter 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:28.020
 then these sweets but it brings 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.670
 energy for you to get up with 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.970
 all the way is to say the schedule then 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:38.850
 there will be breakfast breakfast how to do 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:39.480
 avoid the dessert dress as I said that the 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.500
 night 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:45.030
 It's a little like only been a good 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.610
 breakfast is for example bread 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:58.010
 breakfast and here I have breakfast and 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:06:01.010
 It's great with a coffee with milk or a 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.010
 yogurt 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:10.970
 because even if it looks like a lie, it is digested 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:10.970
 very easy is a question 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:18.890
 a question to do it 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:33.990
 but it will be in de marjah but they are missing 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.590
 two months of work so patience 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.590
 patience 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:43.080
 if they are all these recipes in the 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:43.080
 second but not for telling anything else 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.460
 thinking about that if you do not get all 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.470
 these seeds and you only got 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.660
 for example oats and like that is more 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:54.280
 easy to get you can make him think 

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.980
 that the amounts that are from seeds 

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:59.080
 it's 125 grams so what it does is 

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:01.030
 express that amount in coconut and in 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:05.290
 oatmeal stool only from coconut oats 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:06.730
 oat chocolate coconut as less 

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:08.710
 best 

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:10.870
 and let's say and say that actually the 

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:14.380
 serial bar bought sorry for yes 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:20.350
