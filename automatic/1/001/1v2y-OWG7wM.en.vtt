I only scored 23 points in the first
quarter<00:02:12.700> of<00:02:12.880> this<00:02:13.240> game<00:02:13.360> and<00:02:13.780> I<00:02:13.900> say<00:02:14.080> only<00:02:14.290> 23

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
quarter of this game and I say only 23

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.430 
quarter of this game and I say only 23
as<00:02:15.280> if<00:02:15.880> it's<00:02:16.030> a<00:02:16.120> bad<00:02:16.300> thing<00:02:16.360> only<00:02:16.750> two<00:02:17.050> points

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
as if it's a bad thing only two points

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.410

off<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.740> case<00:02:17.980> but<00:02:18.730> I<00:02:18.760> thought<00:02:19.030> I<00:02:19.060> was<00:02:19.300> going

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
off the case but I thought I was going

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.360

to<00:02:19.480> have<00:02:19.690> such<00:02:20.050> a<00:02:20.080> better<00:02:20.470> first<00:02:20.920> quarter

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
to have such a better first quarter

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.820 
to have such a better first quarter
