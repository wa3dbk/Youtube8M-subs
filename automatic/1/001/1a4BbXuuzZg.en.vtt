00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.960 
ground strokes I feel then I was pretty
much<00:01:35.880> copying<00:01:36.390> stuff<00:01:36.690> on<00:01:37.280> the<00:01:38.280> style<00:01:38.550> of<00:01:38.729> play

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
much copying stuff on the style of play

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.790 
much copying stuff on the style of play
is<00:01:39.150> not<00:01:39.330> the<00:01:39.450> only<00:01:39.600> aspect<00:01:39.990> that's<00:01:40.290> changed

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800 
is not the only aspect that's changed

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.980 
is not the only aspect that's changed
since<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.159> crow<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.369> joined<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.850> tour<00:01:42.060> levels

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
since the crow I joined the tour levels

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.139 
since the crow I joined the tour levels
of<00:01:43.140> fitness<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.680> strength<00:01:43.860> are<00:01:44.580> now<00:01:44.759> at<00:01:45.030> an

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
of fitness and strength are now at an

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.100 
of fitness and strength are now at an
all-time<00:01:45.330> high

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110
