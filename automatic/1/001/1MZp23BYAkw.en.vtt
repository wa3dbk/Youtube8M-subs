00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:04.240
 and did dry x5 also call him 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.600
 very important moment for 20 years 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.519
 white black is more than a variant with an inscription 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.139
 such and did the words in general then covering soft 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:16.470
 on things in black 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.539
 in white, look anyway 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.539
 enough china 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.919
 we call it from Greece 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:27.780
 but aggression point 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.600
 but only in two versions are not white 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.489
 play now how accurate 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.129
 apparently the watchman was injured in general 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:35.690
 looks like dynamics 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.020
 echoed the touch keys 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.920
 top button 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.920
 accounting and here are the touch keys 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.930
 take on an oblique swoops on the fact that her 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.010
 large 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.010
 volume keys 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.290
 there turnout is removed from 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.310
 Well, yes, and the same time, this device 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.040
 plastic 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.260
 and here is the memory card here 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.080
 equals own sim card 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.650
 develop 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.460
 than enough 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.400
 OK 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.350
 screen is torquey 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.720
 capacitive but viewing angles are not the best 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.480
 I will honestly say 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.900
 if you look at the main menu 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.580
 who runs that fast enough 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.310
 as 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.710
 arm7 worth 800 megahertz processor memory is not 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.970
 so many operational heaps of three hundred megabytes 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.110
 In general, the apparatus for this parameter 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.060
 nerves 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.640
 he is something special 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.790
 JAMA camera usually has sata interface 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.980
 autofocus 5 megapixel ip 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.040
 LED flash 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.790
 shoot more or less normally 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.800
 and considering that this couple will be noted in 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.100
 rival yanao and burned like me there from 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.550
 comments 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.750
 that year we can see steel 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.000
 only preinstalled 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.030
 calendar contacts in Kamensky goal 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.770
 preinstalled 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.880
 that is, everything to see here is 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.489
 hi installation 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.819
 actually 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.639
 knowing what 

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:15.759
 with 

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:18.759
 wall g 

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:22.589
 pike 

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:30.309
 if you look at mbk 

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:33.059
 such an opportunity, then here everything is extremely 

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:36.059
 simply 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.409
 daughter scud 

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:46.259
 but does not support 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.539
 twitter from stacks held 

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:52.539
 I built it myself insurance manager 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:55.739
 Here is such a corporate 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.950
 we can see what we have on the system 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.409
 information shows 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:04.799
 machine want to start selling for 13 thousand 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:05.829
 rubles 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:07.719
 what in my opinion 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:10.839
 quite expensive 2 and 2 m 

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:12.569
 but here we are the series itself 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.659
 processes 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:17.269
 before that it costs android not two and three 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:18.789
 expensive 

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:21.739
 what to say here is just a question to 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.469
 this of course although the apparatus did 

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:27.069
 in general there is no special uni 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.680
 no, because it would make you talk 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.939
 On him 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:35.159
 A good screen is average but 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:37.379
 quality 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.479
 same as cooking for example sony ericsson 

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:43.349
 fast enough with speed not 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:45.089
 causes a question but it appears very 

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:48.319
 late late and cost 13 thousand hectares 

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:50.889
 main problem 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:52.299
 White and black 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.739
 here are two colors to say something special 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.799
 I can not anymore 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.680
 protocols and express md1 to court rub 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.989
 as a matter of fact 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.749
 confused android 

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:05.239
 plus several applications 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:06.219
 good body
