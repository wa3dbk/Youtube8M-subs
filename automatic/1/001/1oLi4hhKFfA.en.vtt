to make a skull and found one some that

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.109 
to make a skull and found one some that
looked<00:00:22.199> cool<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.470> then<00:00:22.859> I<00:00:23.010> kind<00:00:23.939> of<00:00:24.000> went

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
crazy with them and I ended up turning

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.820 
crazy with them and I ended up turning
it<00:00:26.699> into<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.910> full<00:00:27.210> island<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.260> private<00:00:28.619> lake

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.370 
it into a full island and private lake
and<00:00:29.070> everything<00:00:29.429> so<00:00:29.789> anyways<00:00:30.660> it's<00:00:31.140> gotta

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
and everything so anyways it's gotta

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.229 
and everything so anyways it's gotta
gotta<00:00:31.949> have<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.279> rendering<00:00:32.640> distance<00:00:33.030> here

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
gotta have the rendering distance here

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.170 
gotta have the rendering distance here
so<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.570> fog<00:00:33.840> makes<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.410> look<00:00:34.559> cool<00:00:34.829> but<00:00:35.180> it's

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
here because of the damn portals to

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.860 
here because of the damn portals to
another<00:02:40.590> but<00:02:41.400> anyways<00:02:43.460> there's<00:02:44.460> one<00:02:44.870> stupid

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
another but anyways there's one stupid

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:56.260 
another but anyways there's one stupid
chicken<00:02:49.550> and<00:02:51.080> so<00:02:52.080> underneath<00:02:52.740> this<00:02:53.010> guy<00:02:53.160> is

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.380 

mine<00:02:57.270> shaft<00:02:57.650> if<00:02:58.650> you<00:02:58.830> go<00:02:59.010> in<00:02:59.310> here<00:02:59.820> you<00:03:00.210> just

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
mine shaft if you go in here you just

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.300 
mine shaft if you go in here you just
look<00:03:00.630> down<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.110> that<00:03:01.500> actually<00:03:01.710> goes<00:03:02.040> all<00:03:02.280> the

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
look down and that actually goes all the

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.270 
look down and that actually goes all the
way<00:03:02.520> down<00:03:02.550> to<00:03:03.500> bedrock<00:03:06.860> so<00:03:07.860> I<00:03:07.890> found<00:03:08.100> my

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
way down to bedrock so I found my

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:16.510 
way down to bedrock so I found my
diamond<00:03:08.670> and<00:03:10.130> then<00:03:11.130> we<00:03:12.090> come<00:03:12.300> over<00:03:12.330> here<00:03:14.390> and

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
diamond and then we come over here and

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.050 
diamond and then we come over here and
you<00:03:17.520> can't<00:03:17.760> really<00:03:17.940> get<00:03:18.240> to<00:03:18.450> it<00:03:18.600> without<00:03:20.060> going

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
you can't really get to it without going

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.030 
you can't really get to it without going
all<00:03:21.270> the<00:03:21.420> way<00:03:21.510> around<00:03:21.630> but<00:03:22.080> you<00:03:22.650> can<00:03:22.770> get<00:03:22.890> up

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
all the way around but you can get up

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.590 
all the way around but you can get up
into<00:03:23.250> that<00:03:23.340> guy's<00:03:23.640> nose<00:03:23.910> and<00:03:24.180> it<00:03:24.270> just<00:03:24.450> goes

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
into that guy's nose and it just goes

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.770 
into that guy's nose and it just goes
out<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:24.990> back<00:03:25.170> I<00:03:26.000> did<00:03:27.000> line<00:03:27.240> the<00:03:27.390> whole<00:03:27.510> place

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
out the back I did line the whole place

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.810 
out the back I did line the whole place
with<00:03:28.050> trees<00:03:28.230> I<00:03:28.770> think<00:03:28.980> it<00:03:29.100> adds<00:03:29.220> a<00:03:29.400> nice<00:03:29.550> little

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
with trees I think it adds a nice little

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:35.900 
with trees I think it adds a nice little
depth<00:03:30.120> to<00:03:30.480> it<00:03:32.570> and<00:03:33.570> then<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:35.190> last<00:03:35.220> place<00:03:35.700> I'm

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
depth to it and then the last place I'm

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.370 
depth to it and then the last place I'm
going<00:03:36.090> to<00:03:36.180> show<00:03:36.360> you<00:03:36.420> is<00:03:36.720> actually<00:03:37.080> underneath

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
going to show you is actually underneath

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.740 
going to show you is actually underneath
my<00:03:37.680> house<00:03:37.860> it's<00:03:38.460> a<00:03:38.520> nice<00:03:38.670> little<00:03:38.970> room<00:03:39.540> I

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
my house it's a nice little room I

my house it's a nice little room I
haven't<00:03:40.080> really<00:03:40.200> figured<00:03:40.530> out<00:03:40.740> what<00:03:40.950> it's<00:03:41.100> for

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
haven't really figured out what it's for

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.860 
haven't really figured out what it's for
yet<00:03:41.990> but<00:03:42.990> I<00:03:43.020> got<00:03:43.470> creative<00:03:44.130> and<00:03:44.490> I<00:03:44.780> don't<00:03:45.780> know

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
yet but I got creative and I don't know

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:55.120 
yet but I got creative and I don't know
and<00:03:46.520> you<00:03:47.520> can<00:03:47.730> be<00:03:47.850> the<00:03:47.970> judge<00:03:53.570> here's<00:03:54.570> the<00:03:54.810> room

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
it's pretty fun I don't know I get bored

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.150

sometimes<00:03:59.610> just<00:04:00.510> get<00:04:00.750> on<00:04:00.870> here<00:04:01.200> and<00:04:01.230> make

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
sometimes just get on here and make

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:08.150 
sometimes just get on here and make
stuff<00:04:04.610> so<00:04:05.610> yeah<00:04:05.850> I<00:04:06.660> do<00:04:07.470> have<00:04:07.620> a<00:04:07.680> texture<00:04:08.010> pack

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
stuff so yeah I do have a texture pack

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.410 
stuff so yeah I do have a texture pack
on<00:04:08.340> that's<00:04:08.550> why<00:04:08.670> everything<00:04:09.030> looks<00:04:09.240> a<00:04:09.330> little

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
on that's why everything looks a little

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.390 
on that's why everything looks a little
different<00:04:10.280> but<00:04:12.440> this<00:04:13.440> was<00:04:13.620> definitely<00:04:13.740> fun<00:04:14.250> to

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
different but this was definitely fun to

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.900
