building I'm going to turn the camera
around<00:01:19.460> and<00:01:20.420> get<00:01:20.600> a<00:01:20.630> good<00:01:20.900> look<00:01:20.930> at<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:21.950> side

the same structure with a layer of soil

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.300 
the same structure with a layer of soil
on<00:01:33.979> top<00:01:34.009> a<00:01:34.640> lot<00:01:35.630> of<00:01:35.780> glass<00:01:35.990> has<00:01:36.200> been<00:01:36.229> added<00:01:36.710> but

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
on top a lot of glass has been added but

00:01:37.310 --> 00:02:14.900 
on top a lot of glass has been added but
there's<00:01:37.549> still<00:01:37.880> more<00:01:38.240> to<00:01:38.299> add

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:37.219 
in an Euler structure Mike added these

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:39.220 
in an Euler structure Mike added these
because<00:02:37.760> he<00:02:37.879> expects<00:02:38.420> stronger<00:02:38.870> than<00:02:39.079> average
