00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.589 
the bat guess who first of all I love
the<00:00:24.269> packaging<00:00:24.449> it's<00:00:25.080> pretty<00:00:25.740> sick<00:00:26.039> that's

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 
the packaging it's pretty sick that's

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.630

sort<00:00:27.599> of<00:00:27.660> what<00:00:27.779> attracted<00:00:28.199> me<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.640> just

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
sort of what attracted me to it just

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.849 
sort of what attracted me to it just
because<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:29.939> looks<00:00:29.970> like<00:00:30.349> also<00:00:31.349> because<00:00:31.679> it's

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
because it looks like also because it's

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.410 
because it looks like also because it's
like<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.189> creapure<00:00:32.520> that<00:00:32.910> everyone<00:00:33.210> has<00:00:33.329> a
