00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
was my first real event I start started

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.510 
was my first real event I start started
doing<00:00:43.559> this<00:00:43.649> follow<00:00:43.890> me<00:00:44.010> when<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.190> was<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.370> fifth

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
doing this follow me when I was in fifth

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.670 
doing this follow me when I was in fifth
grade<00:00:44.670> or<00:00:44.969> sixth<00:00:45.239> grade<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.629> then<00:00:45.780> in<00:00:46.079> seventh

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
grade or sixth grade and then in seventh

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.959 
grade or sixth grade and then in seventh
grade<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.860> won<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.190> Nationals<00:00:47.610> back<00:00:47.760> in<00:00:47.879> the

grade I won the Nationals back in the
USA<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:49.140> guess<00:00:49.469> it's<00:00:49.500> gone<00:00:49.770> from

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.520 
USA and so I guess it's gone from
spelling<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.520> poker<00:00:50.760> at<00:00:51.000> this<00:00:51.149> point<00:00:51.390> now<00:00:51.570> how

English<00:00:55.010> genius<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.250> mathematician<00:00:56.879> so<00:00:57.180> I

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
English genius and mathematician so I

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.700
