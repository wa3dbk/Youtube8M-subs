00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.730
 hello in this tutorial I'm going to teach you 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.070
 how 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.770
 how to create 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:11.870
 a ghost horse the last fact of 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.950
 Minecraft 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.560
 - what do we need 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.980
 it's a weird horse do not notice any 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.980
 horse 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.180
 qatar 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.100
 now 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.100
 for the volume 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:40.950
 I'm going to put the saddle of this horse 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.950
 and I'm going to transform it into a horse 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.580
 light for example 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.460
 apples 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:32.770
 and this on the face 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.770
 and now what we will transform 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.300
 and well now you have to kill him and 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.420
 you have a 25% chance that you 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:51.100
 make a ghost horse we will approve 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.100
 if it does not come out and if I do not teach you 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.040
 it has not come out 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.820
 and good I'll show you one 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.820
 a horse 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.200
 you see 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.540
 this is a pegasus ghost you get 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.969
 you have to kill 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.719
 a pegasus for me to come out of this 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:19.110
 horse without notes to a horse that does not 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:22.270
 be 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.660
 that does not have wings will leave us 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.880
 a normal horse without wings but without 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:32.160
 you kill for example even better are a 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.160
 black pegasus is going to come out this 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.170
 let's try an egg 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.720
 you see 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.180
 it's a ghost horse 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.819
 I have a job but what I do not have is a 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.749
 horse 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:58.109
 ghosts but without wings and good this 

00:02:55.749 --> 00:03:02.110
