00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:22.949
 I was not here can not have the license 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.150
 that he always gives a mind 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.990
 Passed on the zte in the ear then came 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.550
 this idea 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.740
 This is a code to show that the 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.300
 audience is watching movie I realized 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.850
 When he's really lying, it 's a 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.950
 is a language is actually had as 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.329
 no subscribers had I 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.520
 I consider government to be a great 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.469
 liar he is that kind of person 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.570
 that in the day to day you think that a little lie 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.739
 even to please that talking guy 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.590
 This is how life is, but the thing is 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.899
 It's not there and the godoy mother is not great and 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.180
 even fattened is that he thinks the lie to the 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.289
 times is a backdrop to take away 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.000
 some situations 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.910
 This photographed with a dress goes 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.640
 fernando die so that her character 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.510
 The whole movie is very innocent. 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.270
 then do not 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.310
 a turn back there does not show well 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.890
 smart do you think that if there were 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.200
 to keep a movie sequence analyzed 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.229
 I will continue to believe in Fernando 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.290
 I do not think I can handle it. 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.259
 all there in hope of it 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.119
 It's finally a nice guy, she 's tangled up. 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.670
 do not know why but she believes 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.640
 believing in him with hope and then 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.159
 she makes the turn that she does not 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.710
 It was so naive, yes, but I think 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.909
 then she would never go younger you do 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.310
 the typical bodyguard stallion ne 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.780
 How the hell did you prepare for 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:49.950
 somehow inspired by some the 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:53.579
 Lecce on the idea but he's a kitschy bastard 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:57.630
 neat stallion but extremely 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:02:00.840
 got out of fear of the senator's valentina 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:04.020
 so he ties it to him, it's only for those who have 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.990
 more fear than this guy I valentina 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.019
 single player except me 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.379
 not lied to the Mexican will you have arrived 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:15.239
 and soon she has panties and bra the first day 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:18.269
 on the first day with rain for you 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.459
 very difficult is actually to find out that 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:23.040
 she I accepted I hugged the project with 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.970
 very caring for the cast of people 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.430
 involved 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.700
 even before knowing the script was in the 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.830
 basis of trust and after I had already 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.239
 I was already blond, I was 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.489
 I learned of this small detail that 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:38.940
 I was in lingerie that 90% of the scenes 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:41.670
 now missing both the flu is you 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.500
 as in the case the fernando really is 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.170
 The guy who is curling up but he does not 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.549
 it's bad character is not yet clear whether giving 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.160
 right on top of the others he really 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:52.019
 is always on good intentions will doing 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.930
 bullshit in your personal life you have to 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.910
 give a call once again but 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.489
 this leads to real problems. 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.209
 lie is an element that is not very 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.650
 cool 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.989
 even more so when one uses it 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.940
 compulsive is even well intentioned 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.910
 Do you think the movie will win a 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.400
 sequence and if so what would be a 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:15.060
 possible sequence we see each other speaking 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:20.720
 Angeles was very good, says Pedro. 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.720
 that's where I'll be right back 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:28.760
 Thank you, delegate, you think it will. 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.760
 Marrying you is because I 'm
