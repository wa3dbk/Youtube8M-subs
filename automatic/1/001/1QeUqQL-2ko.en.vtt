00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.750
 and has it arrived here 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.270
 Welcome to an unboxing 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.160
 we get the whole thing in this 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:16.640
 black box this really pretty 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.210
 Chic and edged by this little one 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.400
 carton 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.199
 he also really looks pretty chic 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.999
 what do we have everything we have 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.409
 of course, a data cable around the whole 

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:26.119
 with the notebook or the pc too 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:27.949
 connect and exchange data 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.810
 music videos songs and so on or 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.310
 the whole other public to load 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.780
 can load now also spatially 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.390
 Internet is stuck together 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.239
 of course, over the normal sized usb 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.609
 here we have micro-usb for 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.379
 the micro is her so you can load that 

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:44.329
 this is not a micro sim 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.699
 map purely accurate leaf we pick 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.160
 get this sled out with this new one 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:52.039
 to get it done and we have it 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.190
 a quick guide or a safety 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:57.829
 and guarantee card and now come 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.710
 also lust object of the year and indeed 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:03.469
 do you have the nexus 4 here? 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.420
 so it looks it's not a front for no 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:08.119
 Press device but that's how you get it 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.000
 from the google place gate we mean 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.799
 have the right off over the 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.439
 it was speculated the hardware is right 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.149
 complete and everything wonderful we catch 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:19.130
 with the left side 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:20.450
 we see no i will catch you with the 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.200
 left wheels we look that whole 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.720
 generally 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.159
 we have the form we already have from the 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.710
 previous generation that means 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.689
 Here it is clean rounded we have 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.909
 here a metal frame and from rome 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:34.040
 plastic frames that are discussed and that 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.630
 device is really awesome in the 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.899
 So brave is not really there 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.710
 a lot of 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:41.450
 grateful, of course, the glass roof , too 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.640
 left side we rehearse the 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.840
 volume rocker we have it standing 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.270
 get out and we have one 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.070
 awesome pressure point underneath like that 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.229
 already shown the sled for the 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.789
 micro sim card micro sim means you 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.259
 must you a new sim card folders 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:59.439
 or let the other cut 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:02.719
 we have the one on the right side 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.770
 expansion unlocks key howsoever 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.509
 you want to call them 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.759
 she also stands out properly and 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.490
 has a great pressure point on the 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.470
 top we see the customer with 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.870
 for active noise cancellation in 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.480
 phone calls with the speaker 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.580
 little speaker or in person 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.010
 videos so that the ambient noise 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.430
 be filtered out 350 millimeters 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.870
 jack connection down here the 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.310
 micro-usb connector two screws the 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.980
 make the whole look really good 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.050
 and the microphone to talk to so 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.790
 the main microphone on the back who 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.540
 the speaker lg lettering 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:40.180
 marking nexus lettering one 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.370
 single led and of course the camera, the 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.590
 camera brings eight megapixels with it 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.990
 videos are in full hd 1080p 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.930
 taken at 30 frames per second 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:52.330
 and of course we have this pattern 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.700
 already speculated on this everywhere 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.470
 whether you like it or not here 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.840
 can you see it anyway 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.060
 reminiscent of the wallpaper of the first 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.220
 nexus device think you remember there 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.290
 it really is a little bit 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.330
 matter of taste is in itself however 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.820
 not something grossly ugly 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.740
 looks in direct sunlight 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.900
 how different exactly how do I show you here 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.180
 so here we are again and if thats me 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.580
 all right now a little seen and so 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.860
 that we come into the sunlight he knows 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.340
 her pattern is very many 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.050
 small circles and others form the 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.650
 to reflect this picture here 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:31.300
 it really is not necessarily female 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.370
 was similar looks really better 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.980
 when I look at the first 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.480
 liked in other videos so is 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.950
 But you have to be really chic 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.050
 Of course, come to terms with it 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.060
 so much to the back front is it 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.520
 continue and indeed we start down 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.290
 Mentioned may not be seen now 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.820
 but we have down here in the middle 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.710
 a notification saint-etienne 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.860
 Nice big notification LED 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:56.110
 really great we really go 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.040
 the display edge up and countryman 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.830
 at the front camera 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:03.580
 this delivers 1.3 megapixels and can 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:05.500
 record videos in 1280 x 1024 pixels 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.860
 So that's enough for 500 No 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.840
 HD recordings forgive go on 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.160
 that looks like it is on the phone 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.140
 of course and we have light and 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.569
 proximity sensor for automatic 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.459
 display brightness 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:20.190
 regulation but also around the display 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.079
 turn off if you are on the phone 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.030
 So much for the details I'll show you 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.370
 again the frame and the transition 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.520
 to the plastic case is here 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.620
 really tight and it really is 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.180
 wonderfully processed when we are in front 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.830
 are then of course the display 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.650
 do not forget the display that 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:41.190
 most important is it offers 4.7 inches tall 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:44.400
 a wx gaa resolution that means 1280 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.259
 x 768 pixel is the same resolution as 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:50.639
 for example, even that only here 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:52.320
 More 920 had 320 pixels per day 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.150
 inch really creates a super genius 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.289
 Worth is we have an ips panel 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:00.090
 means we have high perspectives 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:02.160
 Guarantee can therefore also from such 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.820
 Just look at it and look at it 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.810
 we have both front and back 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.610
 google to the 2 2 as it is 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.930
 sound then it becomes one of the slides 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.460
 I'm just left on it 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:15.050
 have you seen that maybe? 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:18.780
 So no one is so the device is 133.9 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:22.620
 millimeter high is 68 mm wide accurate 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.220
 said 68 7 and 9 millimeters thick or 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.620
 thin 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.970
 it really is super good in the hand 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.979
 I'll tell you again you come with me 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.650
 Fingers everywhere turn where you can 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:33.599
 it would like to come to the edge it weighs 139 grams 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.909
 which is really easy if you like me 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:38.130
 ask is a great value of the fest 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:41.280
 built-in battery 2100 milliamp hours 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:44.669
 really leaves us alone 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:48.449
 unfortunately not replace there are eight 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:51.300
 or 16 gb version that also far again 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:54.000
 about 5 of them are blowing me dead 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:58.050
 the work free something entertaining 6 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.400
 and is really a lot of apps for those 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.139
 on it grab many music videos 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.800
 maybe not so necessarily 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:04.169
 recommend 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.599
 we have the device in black in front of us 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:08.729
 is somehow still come in white 

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:10.400
 you just say as it really does 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:14.669
 will be seen with a 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:17.340
 look at the availability is 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:20.159
 really it went really bad 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:22.710
 and that was already after 18 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:26.960
 Sold out in both 8 and 16 minutes 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:30.229
 gb version was not really 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.970
 good for google unfortunately at the moment or 

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:33.050
 People were just too greedy 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.580
 You can do it the way you want 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.560
 that means if you want to have it 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.630
 unfortunately one is currently waiting for a certain 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.250
 three weeks for directly ordered 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:44.120
 When are the direct pad 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:45.680
 you can not say yes now 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:49.759
 can not be pre-ordered any more 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:51.500
 that means wait is announced for the 8 

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:53.449
 gigabyte version time one if you have it 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:56.330
 someday hinbekommt the Googleplex 

00:06:53.449 --> 00:07:00.229
 so 299 euros and for the 16 gigabytes 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:03.530
 version 349 impressively super fairer 

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:05.840
 Price for what you get offered 

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:08.120
 Is there any wise in my opinion 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.930
 not at the moment so while i am 

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.759
 you, that we have a little bit more 

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:12.199
 We told us we had the device 

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:14.060
 looked at again from all sides 

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:15.470
 That's how I started growing 

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:19.039
 Hope you like the first one 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:21.320
 smartphone with android jelly bean 4.2 too 

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:21.770
 a super g your price with super hard 

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.630
 more 

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:26.199
 Thank you for your time 

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.199
 take care
