00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:08.370
 we had always thought that life 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.690
 extra terrestrial would come from the stars 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.750
 but it has arisen from the depths of 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.750
 the ocean 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:23.999
 the first kaiju was taken out of the water at 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:23.999
 san francisco 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:32.440
 the second attack had hit shackle 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.830
 then the third strikes at cabo us 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:37.830
 we understood that it would not stop 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:42.030
 to fight monsters 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.030
 we created our own monsters 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:50.440
 and we needed a new weapon on 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.440
 jaeger program was born 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.310
 two pilots our brains our memories 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.049
 connected 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.199
 and the man and the machine do not do 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.199
 one 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.080
 today at the limits of hope 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.760
 of our time 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.369
 go ahead to believe the one year 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.150
 we face the monsters that are at 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.150
 our door 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.370
 today we neutralize 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.370
 the apocalypse 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.920
 that's awfully blow 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.019
