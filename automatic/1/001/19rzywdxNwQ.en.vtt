then<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.490> want<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.729> create<00:01:33.150> lines<00:01:33.450> down<00:01:33.930> the

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
then you want to create lines down the

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.930 
then you want to create lines down the
marks<00:01:35.159> you've<00:01:35.340> did<00:01:36.110> and<00:01:37.110> then

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.040 

1.5<00:01:40.940> centimeters<00:01:41.890> down<00:01:43.630> you<00:01:44.630> want<00:01:44.810> to<00:01:44.900> make<00:01:44.990> a

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
1.5 centimeters down you want to make a

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.960 
1.5 centimeters down you want to make a
line<00:01:45.490> and<00:01:46.490> then<00:01:46.970> you<00:01:47.390> can<00:01:47.540> cut<00:01:47.720> up<00:01:47.750> it<00:01:48.050> off<00:01:48.970> 1.5

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
line and then you can cut up it off 1.5

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.680 
line and then you can cut up it off 1.5
meet<00:01:50.240> no<00:01:50.750> one<00:01:50.780> put<00:01:51.170> five<00:01:51.380> centimeters<00:01:51.980> out<00:01:52.690> you

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
meet no one put five centimeters out you

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.140 
meet no one put five centimeters out you
want<00:01:53.840> to<00:01:53.930> make<00:01:54.050> a<00:01:54.110> line<00:01:54.380> down<00:01:54.730> and<00:01:55.730> then<00:01:55.880> you

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
want to make a line down and then you

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.840 
want to make a line down and then you
don't<00:01:56.300> need<00:01:56.480> that<00:01:56.720> order<00:01:57.230> and<00:01:57.530> then<00:01:58.520> to<00:01:58.700> the

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
don't need that order and then to the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.310 
don't need that order and then to the
other<00:01:59.000> side<00:01:59.780> so<00:02:00.740> you<00:02:00.800> want<00:02:01.040> to<00:02:01.210> 1.5<00:02:02.210> from<00:02:02.660> there

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
other side so you want to 1.5 from there

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.850 
other side so you want to 1.5 from there
to<00:02:03.710> there<00:02:04.270> 1.5<00:02:05.270> from<00:02:05.720> a<00:02:06.040> day<00:02:07.840> and<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:09.229> lines<00:02:09.440> of

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
to there 1.5 from a day and the lines of

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.020 
to there 1.5 from a day and the lines of
did<00:02:10.100> there<00:02:10.780> just<00:02:11.780> for<00:02:11.990> when<00:02:12.460> you've<00:02:13.460> cut

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
did there just for when you've cut

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.700 
did there just for when you've cut
everything<00:02:14.480> out<00:02:15.610> do<00:02:16.610> they<00:02:16.910> will<00:02:17.060> be<00:02:17.210> the<00:02:17.360> tops

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
everything out do they will be the tops

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.320 
everything out do they will be the tops
so<00:02:18.710> you<00:02:18.770> want<00:02:19.010> to<00:02:19.100> cut<00:02:19.250> them<00:02:19.430> off<00:02:19.610> and<00:02:19.940> cut<00:02:20.150> them

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
so you want to cut them off and cut them

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.200 
so you want to cut them off and cut them
off<00:02:20.510> and<00:02:20.990> that<00:02:21.500> will<00:02:21.620> be<00:02:21.770> what<00:02:21.920> you<00:02:22.070> glue<00:02:22.370> to

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
off and that will be what you glue to

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.420 
off and that will be what you glue to
make<00:02:23.920> one<00:02:24.920> of<00:02:25.040> these<00:02:25.130> single<00:02:25.790> cubes<00:02:27.280> and<00:02:28.280> eight

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
make one of these single cubes and eight

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.430 
make one of these single cubes and eight
nine<00:02:28.730> of<00:02:28.940> them<00:02:29.120> to<00:02:29.300> make<00:02:29.480> this<00:02:31.780> ad<00:02:32.780> of<00:02:33.110> them<00:02:33.230> to

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
nine of them to make this ad of them to

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.800 
nine of them to make this ad of them to
make<00:02:33.590> love<00:02:33.920> where<00:02:34.820> you<00:02:34.910> can<00:02:35.060> make<00:02:35.240> them<00:02:35.420> as<00:02:35.540> big

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
make love where you can make them as big

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.440 
make love where you can make them as big
or<00:02:35.990> as<00:02:36.050> small<00:02:36.290> as<00:02:36.770> you<00:02:36.920> want<00:02:39.700> I'll<00:02:40.700> call<00:02:41.180> that<00:02:41.420> a

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
or as small as you want I'll call that a

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:51.630 
or as small as you want I'll call that a
little<00:02:41.780> bit<00:02:48.970> just<00:02:49.970> so<00:02:50.090> in<00:02:50.510> case<00:02:50.840> you<00:02:51.050> need<00:02:51.230> it

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
little bit just so in case you need it

00:02:51.640 --> 00:03:53.660 
little bit just so in case you need it
so<00:02:52.640> do<00:02:53.480> some<00:02:53.720> for<00:02:54.080> you<00:02:54.230> too

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.860 

so<00:03:57.030> it's<00:03:58.030> probably<00:03:58.239> the<00:03:58.480> wrong<00:03:58.599> way<00:03:58.810> around

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
so it's probably the wrong way around

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:05.030 
so it's probably the wrong way around
for<00:03:59.319> use<00:03:59.440> but<00:04:00.900> unless<00:04:01.900> it<00:04:02.140> isn't<00:04:03.720> puts

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
for use but unless it isn't puts

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.490 
for use but unless it isn't puts
centimeters<00:04:06.040> up<00:04:06.280> or<00:04:06.790> you<00:04:07.720> want<00:04:07.870> every<00:04:08.200> square

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500
