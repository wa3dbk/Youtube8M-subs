00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:12.630
 It was here, people are saying, what are you talking about? 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.089
 half a kilo are all welcome more 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.609
 A video of today I'm bringing 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.130
 you a koff gameplay of ghosts that 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.020
 will basically serve as an escape plan 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.410
 So we can chat in 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.380
 relation to some subjects that are 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:30.900
 playstation 4 xbox the year and some games 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.899
 So I'm waiting and for now. 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.149
 not arrived is damn submarine is 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.270
 rolling like hell to power 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.550
 to deliver the games but anyway, just go 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.739
 That's just for you to keep track of what 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.469
 happened in it was unanimous play 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.690
 interesting but too long 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.750
 It will take about eight minutes 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.010
 I even cut off the start because 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.440
 leave all that opening of 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.660
 loading the map advantage to 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.090
 start the game at last and pilot loses 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.910
 almost a minute in that there then 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.470
 I ended up giving a little cut to 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.309
 can be a little leaner 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.720
 gameplay 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.450
 and another detail that you will see still 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.820
 the image of the pink game 6 is taboo 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.409
 using the system for color blindness by 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.420
 So you 're seeing the same 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.979
 a little strange coloration 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.259
 in this game place that I captured 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.950
 old right because it is red 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.939
 pink and what is green what is blue is 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.720
 half green 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.950
 but finally the interesting game gibim 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.810
 Quiet calm my team 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.020
 started losing later it got better 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.680
 and we got one managed to win and 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.409
 with one with an amount of punctuation 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:43.740
 reasonable to 100 in relation to the 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.990
 opponent but come on guys are me 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.700
 Wondering why I have not bought it yet? 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.930
 playstation 4 and if I'm going to buy one 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.299
 Playstation 4 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.399
 Good guys are the following playstation 4 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.119
 not bought because the price it one 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:59.460
 national model is very expensive 4 thousand 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.950
 Real is a lot of money for you to pay 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.649
 electronic and people I do not feel 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.270
 trustworthy I feel comfortable 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.149
 buy a console that is not from a 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.710
 official store nowadays in brazil 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.930
 first because I 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.430
 very unlucky with the electronic equipment 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.310
 I already missed TV 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:21.180
 I already lost two playstation 3 and xbox 360 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:24.420
 for defects of the equipment then you 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.860
 then buy a handset of two crazy 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.350
 thousand reais will vote and I can not 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.300
 Picking Up Your Playstation 4 Is In The Market 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.070
 gray a store that is not official 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.760
 two thousand and five hundred reais, sometimes 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.560
 2 thousand flights and think you buy and 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.120
 so in sign of wonder problem 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.240
 you will use the quiet apparatus 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.480
 But if it's a problem and then how's it going? 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.490
 do the store you may have ignored the 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.950
 I do not live in Sao Paulo, for example. 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:53.040
 where the vast majority of stores end up 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.470
 having a kind of a physical store the type 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.720
 then it's always complicated 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.030
 you buy a device with no logic 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.070
 It's official still living in a city. 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.720
 a little further 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.200
 So, so you can get guarantees. 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.700
 It's not always easy either, I confess. 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.290
 to you that due to the amount of 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.120
 problems I've had with equipment 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.310
 electronic or video games 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.980
 Appliances, I do not feel 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.710
 confident I feel comfortable paying 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.090
 and 2 thousand reais a video game for tomorrow 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.190
 then it does not matter and ends up 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.200
 sucking on him and I'm waiting 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.330
 playstation 4 download time it 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.880
 will have a cheaper price 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.710
 at a national conference probably 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.040
 I'll buy something else too 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:36.720
 who is not getting too caught up in 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.540
 about playstation 4 to buy it 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.530
 I'm not getting agonized. 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.860
 desperate, thank you, buy this 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:46.350
 console is what is the question of the games 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.390
 games that are out for him the 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.090
 multi- platforms are codes and wait for the 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.490
 end of four I 'm playing xbox one 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.560
 It was the console that I preferred to buy by 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.320
 for which a national guarantee is 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.420
 also the price and other detail here 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.260
 exclusive of playstation 4 up to this 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.690
 The exact moment I 'm not doing it. 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.740
 lack of goals and I'm not a fan of killzone 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.860
 although you know that the game has a 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:13.260
 quality cool cool multiplayer is cool 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.630
 the campaign mode is also interesting 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.579
 cnac a game that really does not make me 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.389
 good 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:22.340
 there is the idea of ​​wanting to play it and then 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:24.710
 has the infamous going out in February 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.629
 or March next year and also a game 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.430
 Nice, but what I do not like is not 

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:30.560
 I really like this kind of open game I 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:34.009
 I prefer more game of games more 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.270
 and fitch has dropped there is even a 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:36.860
 boring and such 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.650
 and these two games I told you 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.990
 like east forum key 4 fans 2 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.750
 anyway are the games that would make me buy 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.419
 a playstation 4 however these games think 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.310
 that you only end of next year 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.050
 so she has a lot of time until then 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.090
 playstation 4 election will likely 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.430
 will lower prices who knows the people 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.740
 will have the official stores and selling the 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.050
 unit in a much more fair and stretch 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:03.139
 national guarantee and then you do not have 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:05.569
 no problem then it's just for 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:07.039
 to let you feel good about this 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:09.110
 I'm probably going to play here 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:11.270
 but only when you have a fairer price 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.360
 most talked about had national and 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.250
 Also games that will make me play it 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.199
 It's because for now to do it for you. 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.659
 who do not feel like playing 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:23.300
 playstation 4 despite wanting one too 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:26.840
 I want like everyone for sure. 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.490
 or in relation to xbox the year in the top 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.889
 having fun with it, I'm playing 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.050
 I really think he's cool 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:35.089
 kinect looks like such a silly thing 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.759
 for some people however it is very 

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:39.919
 fun ends up adding enough value 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:42.259
 to the style of gameplay a little fred 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:44.240
 You saw and some games already brought 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:48.169
 you use kinect can the end 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:50.690
 from 41 taiko to the kinect sports we took 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:52.430
 It is also pretty cool to see what is a 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.529
 silly thing you have to talk about 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.139
 rolling in front of the TV headquarters 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:58.069
 such but it's cool you get 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:05:59.569
 amuse 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:01.370
 These days were some friends of mine here. 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:04.159
 At home we were playing here in the 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.960
 roskill jet ski and every agent 

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:07.430
 You said that you were laughing a lot. 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.379
 really fun 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.000
 and another detail is that the games 

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:11.870
 exclusive of xbox street in this exact 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.699
 right moment 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:17.419
 They are pleasing me more for example. 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:19.400
 force 5 dollars into three pillars are 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:21.379
 the three games I'm very anxious 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.509
 To play I've already pre-sold on 

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:25.039
 Submarine for the day 22 I already bought this 

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:27.340
 game in October for you to have a 

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:29.560
 idea only that the submarine 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:31.120
 when I think they will not deliver 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.160
 only next week 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.740
 so I will receive the game basically 15 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.540
 days after its worldwide launch, it 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.440
 Could be playing the games a lot. 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.050
 time 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.970
 while my friends are playing stunts 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:44.590
 It's finally here, there are a lot of people 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.570
 playing these games 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:48.370
 I'm here sucking the finger, we can not 

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.630
 play them, but for now 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:52.210
 It's cool because I'm playing well. 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:54.610
 After 4 or play the taiko is me 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:56.800
 leaving very happy because they are games 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.419
 different and I did not have 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.330
 possibility of playing for example a 

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:03.490
 playstation 3 and xbox 360 even more than 

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:06.130
 My pc too bichado para juego vai 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:08.650
 so I 'm having a lot of fun with 

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:11.590
 xbox one I confess to you guys that 

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:14.160
 even surprised me about the console 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:15.430
 quality of thech quality material 

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.200
 live 

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:18.760
 the games are very cool despite 

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:22.360
 some are giving a type problem were 

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:24.729
 24 closes sometimes but generally the 

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:27.220
 console is pleasing me and I 

00:07:24.729 --> 00:07:29.289
 I think the cost benefit of xbox will go 

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:31.000
 right now it's worth a lot 

00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:33.520
 worth the cheapest selective console 

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.760
 national and extreme games 

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:38.410
 Playstation 4 quality is also a 

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.419
 console very good however I think the 

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:42.669
 games at this early generation only one 

00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:44.530
 Little bad neighbors need to improve one 

00:07:42.669 --> 00:07:48.400
 little but I think next year with the 

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:50.800
 launch of the theoretical a charter 4 to 

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:54.310
 who knows god of war 4 on a console 

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:56.289
 improve their quality is that they are 

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:59.260
 games is not and then ends up becoming 

00:07:56.289 --> 00:08:01.720
 more attractive with a slightly higher price 

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:03.550
 Right, it's just a video, just to 

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:05.110
 to say something to you about 

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:07.990
 these four former teacher 

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:09.520
 both are fantastic consoles but in 

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:11.919
 Since then, you leave a photo, it ends up being a 

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.970
 little tricky for me at least not 

00:08:11.919 --> 00:08:14.110
 arrive I hope you have enjoyed 

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:16.330

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:20.010
