were<00:00:23.789> looking<00:00:24.240> at<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.840> winter<00:00:25.199> period<00:00:25.470> we'd

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
were looking at the winter period we'd

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.890 
were looking at the winter period we'd
see<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.220> nice<00:00:26.430> blue<00:00:26.730> sky<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.090> Golden<00:00:27.750> Gate

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
see a nice blue sky the Golden Gate

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.380 
see a nice blue sky the Golden Gate
Bridge<00:00:28.160> lifting<00:00:29.160> up<00:00:29.279> behind<00:00:29.550> us<00:00:29.730> but<00:00:30.000> as<00:00:30.210> you

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
Bridge lifting up behind us but as you

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.990 
Bridge lifting up behind us but as you
can<00:00:30.539> see<00:00:30.720> here<00:00:31.289> we<00:00:31.410> are<00:00:31.439> bathed<00:00:32.009> in<00:00:32.399> fog<00:00:32.730> that's

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
can see here we are bathed in fog that's

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.850 
can see here we are bathed in fog that's
coming<00:00:33.329> off<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.600> Pacific<00:00:33.960> Ocean<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.440> common

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
coming off the Pacific Ocean a common

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.100 
coming off the Pacific Ocean a common
thing<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.100> we<00:00:35.309> see<00:00:35.430> here<00:00:36.300> in<00:00:36.570> San<00:00:37.079> Francisco

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
thing that we see here in San Francisco

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.190 
thing that we see here in San Francisco
every<00:00:37.739> single<00:00:38.430> summer<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:39.690> Presidio

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
every single summer the Presidio

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.950 
every single summer the Presidio
receives<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:41.100> great<00:00:41.670> deal<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.270> fog<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.719> in<00:00:42.780> fact

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
receives a great deal of fog and in fact

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.360 
receives a great deal of fog and in fact
I<00:00:43.110> think<00:00:43.170> it's<00:00:43.469> probably<00:00:43.739> one<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.040> reasons

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
I think it's probably one of the reasons

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.940 
I think it's probably one of the reasons
why<00:00:44.579> we<00:00:44.789> have<00:00:44.940> such<00:00:45.120> large<00:00:45.390> trees<00:00:45.930> why<00:00:46.890> this

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
why we have such large trees why this

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.130 
why we have such large trees why this
area<00:00:47.370> stays<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:48.120> green<00:00:48.570> during<00:00:48.960> the

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
area stays so green during the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.549 
area stays so green during the
summertime<00:00:53.420> the<00:00:54.420> reason<00:00:54.840> why<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:54.989> bay<00:00:55.260> area<00:00:55.500> I

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
summertime the reason why the bay area I

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.709 
summertime the reason why the bay area I
think<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:55.980> really<00:00:56.309> an<00:00:56.730> interesting<00:00:57.180> area<00:00:57.660> for

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
think is really an interesting area for

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.229 
think is really an interesting area for
fog<00:00:58.140> formation<00:00:58.590> it's<00:00:59.550> it's<00:00:59.730> an<00:00:59.850> interaction

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
fog formation it's it's an interaction

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.170 
fog formation it's it's an interaction
of<00:01:00.719> what's<00:01:01.680> going<00:01:01.859> on<00:01:02.070> in<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.309> Pacific<00:01:02.699> Ocean

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
of what's going on in the Pacific Ocean

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.469 
of what's going on in the Pacific Ocean
the<00:01:03.899> diverse<00:01:04.320> topography<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:05.489> we<00:01:05.610> have<00:01:05.850> here

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
the diverse topography that we have here

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
that allow us to hit the dew point to

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.840 
that allow us to hit the dew point to
hit<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.750> point<00:01:24.930> where<00:01:25.700> condensation<00:01:26.700> occurs

hit the point where condensation occurs

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.120 
hit the point where condensation occurs
either<00:01:27.479> in<00:01:27.780> Central<00:01:28.200> Valley<00:01:28.380> or<00:01:28.590> here<00:01:28.890> on<00:01:29.040> the

either in Central Valley or here on the
coast<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:30.240> we're<00:01:30.450> constantly<00:01:30.780> being

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
coast and so we're constantly being

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.920 
coast and so we're constantly being
exposed<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.460> these<00:01:32.850> sort<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.060> clouds<00:01:33.509> on<00:01:33.810> the

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
two types of fog here in the Bay Area or

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.470 
two types of fog here in the Bay Area or
in<00:01:42.560> California<00:01:42.770> in<00:01:43.250> particular<00:01:43.520> advection

in California in particular advection
fog<00:01:44.810> near<00:01:45.290> the<00:01:45.440> coast<00:01:45.680> and<00:01:46.070> what<00:01:46.940> we<00:01:47.030> call

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
fog near the coast and what we call

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.150 
fog near the coast and what we call
radiation<00:01:47.810> fog<00:01:47.990> which<00:01:48.230> is<00:01:48.380> what<00:01:48.650> we<00:01:48.770> would<00:01:48.920> see

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
radiation fog which is what we would see

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.910 
radiation fog which is what we would see
like<00:01:49.520> in<00:01:49.670> the<00:01:49.760> Central<00:01:50.090> Valley<00:01:50.270> of<00:01:50.450> California

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
like in the Central Valley of California

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.790 
like in the Central Valley of California
during<00:01:51.920> the<00:01:52.100> wintertime<00:01:55.750> advection<00:01:56.750> fog<00:01:57.080> one

summer forms due to the interaction of

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.560 
summer forms due to the interaction of

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
the twist comes in is that it's going to

the twist comes in is that it's going to

seedlings<00:04:25.600> if<00:04:26.140> they<00:04:26.710> see<00:04:26.770> a<00:04:26.950> drier<00:04:27.520> warmer

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
seedlings if they see a drier warmer

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.720 
seedlings if they see a drier warmer
less<00:04:28.900> foggy<00:04:29.260> summer<00:04:29.650> or<00:04:29.890> are<00:04:30.310> we<00:04:30.400> going<00:04:30.520> to<00:04:30.580> get

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
less foggy summer or are we going to get

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.380 
less foggy summer or are we going to get
less<00:04:31.090> recruitment<00:04:31.990> of<00:04:32.140> new<00:04:32.560> forests<00:04:33.280> and<00:04:33.430> so<00:04:34.090> a

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
less recruitment of new forests and so a

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.330 
less recruitment of new forests and so a

years<00:04:36.520> from<00:04:36.700> now<00:04:36.850> we<00:04:37.360> may<00:04:37.540> not<00:04:37.720> have<00:04:37.870> the

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
years from now we may not have the

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.120 
years from now we may not have the
