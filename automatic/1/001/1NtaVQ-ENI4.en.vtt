00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:11.370
 his work and the hayashi galera that I always 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.040
 to you plus an increased gameplay video 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.350
 and today's video is again on call 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.029
 of ghosts we're going to continue today 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.340
 here with some rumors and speculations 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.590
 because today a few more leaks 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.710
 pretty things interesting to look at 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.529
 about codes who say yes this year 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.550
 the code will finally change engine 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.619
 Yeah 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.480
 today I did not intend to bring video where 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.460
 there was the effective video channel but it ended 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.500
 coming out this news then could not 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.520
 letting it happen to you, sure not 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.739
 video will not be too long either 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.180
 because it's a short thing okay but as already 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.890
 It did not have the same then I've stayed longer 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.690
 basically as an extra video for 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.489
 You sure what happened was the 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.590
 you remember the site 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.750
 tesco that was the site that leaked and 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.760
 supposed club cover goals that would be 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.170
 supposedly the colloquium of that year because 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.789
 I brought a video talking about it. 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.750
 It's a couple of days ago for you. 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.180
 less ok 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.230
 and today April 28 that same site 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.170
 came back 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.420
 There's the game as the sale to do 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.250
 is to prevent such only that this time they 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.840
 They also introduced a description 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.880
 would be perhaps the official description 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.020
 of the game is that it should for all sites 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.909
 as soon as the game was announced 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.640
 officially already available in 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.380
 pre-sale and stuff like ok and through 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.360
 from this description we can discover 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.530
 some little things about the game is 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.170
 that we can not give as well 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.729
 sure as far as it really can is no 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.470
 It's true that I said it's all a humor 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.570
 for now there is nothing confirmed but 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.250
 if it's true, okay? 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.619
 it is confirmed that this year people 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.740
 would thus have a default jury in a new 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.930
 next generation engine sure I go 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.909
 read from inscriptions to you already translated 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.189
 and then I'll say a little more about 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.229
 What is written on the table begins the 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.509
 franchise that defined a generation of 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.579
 is determined to raise the level of 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.009
 again with the new call of gosts 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.090
 published by activision and developed 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.740
 by infinity ward 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.350
 the studio that created the original copy and 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.630
 and the saga mode an affair with nine goals 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.460
 inaugurates next generation franchise 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.130
 delivering a new and fascinating 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.619
 experience gameplay built on 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.080
 a story and cast scenes 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.400
 totally new all this fed 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.470
 by a new next generation engine 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.080
 of the jury 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.120
 ok this description basically does not speak 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.620
 nothing more besides 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.940
 but only with this can we take 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.980
 some conclusions 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.330
 if it really is true what happens 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.070
 We're going to have a new engine, I think. 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.320
 I am the principal is what most calls 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.670
 Attention, what else makes me anxious to 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.140
 see how it will work 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.220
 Another thing that I say is that they will 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.500
 deliver a new and fascinating 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.330
 gameplay experience with this I do not know 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.400
 if they mean that the gameplay 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.230
 will have a significant change in 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.090
 relation to employment is already used and 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.500
 this is my biggest fear in relation to 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.120
 code swap debt I already told you this 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.980
 several times here for you see videos 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.860
 which addresses this subject is my great 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.320
 fear and agree to swap debt 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.880
 and 9 change generation let's not say so is 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.380
 precisely the issue of gameplay and 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.090
 perfect copy mobility 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.610
 better gameplay the species has is 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.990
 very fluid very very easy of you 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.780
 learn very easy from you 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:06.450
 to dominate, and change from day to day 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.560
 things change totally so I twist 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.510
 a lot so they can adapt 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.100
 cool play morning with this new one anyway 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.540
 this is my great fear of course that they 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.640
 will always speak well in the description, right? 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.230
 people will only have to test to know if 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.800
 really the business was good playing the 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.920
 game 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.780
 Okay, but then there's this fight, too. 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.060
 they also say that all this is 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.410
 question of the total gameplay of 39 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.540
 fascinating is being built on 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.709
 a story and cast scenes 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.230
 brand new 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:34.260
 this implies that you may escalate 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:37.110
 Goals do not have as much connection to the 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.670
 module a 32 affair and one with history 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.380
 of fairs modules, which is also a 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.040
 little difficult to understand because the ghost 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.870
 if it's really the guy being approached 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.390
 In this game, right? 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.549
 it is difficult to imagine a way in which 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.500
 have a new cast know a story 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.060
 that does not encompass the history of 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.040
 other vacation models especially the 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.970
 drama was 2 which is the code in which the taste 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.430
 and it seems right 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.830
 then I do not know, it opens up a possibility of 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.450
 suddenly the goal scoring does not have 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.060
 compared with the taste of fluence model 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.680
 Something, nothing, just a coincidence. 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.720
 being called goals or something of the type not 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.180
 I know it 's difficult always remembering that this 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.920
 description can still be done ok was the 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.120
 same website that revealed the game boxart 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.720
 which is also not confirmed as 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.950
 certain 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.299
 just to make it clear to you to 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.430
 Who does not understand who is coming? 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.680
 now you have not seen any other video about 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.960
 subject is not yet confirmed that 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.660
 I was talking about this year's cap goals 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.190
 everything is 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.600
 the right mood and I'm bringing those 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.070
 rumors here for you guys are taking 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.240
 their own conclusions 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.550
 but without doubts what most calls attention 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.170
 is the question that perhaps this year the 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.180
 really have a code like a 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.620
 sold and has a new engine I believe 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.390
 which greatly increase the possibilities 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.460
 from the game to the new generation as well 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.080
 ie for playstation 4 and promote 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.640
 xbox that is about to be announced on 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.430
 next May 21 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:51.280
 however there is another site this time 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:54.130
 called action life is a site in Spain 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.230
 also with nine goals for the 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:00.820
 pre-sale and these the extradition of it to 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:03.490
 ps3 xbox 360 pc and oe or the same 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:06.370
 platforms from which blackbox 2 was 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:09.040
 released last year so nothing of 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.600
 new consoles for now and nothing more 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.280
 than this also this store only 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.780
 put pre sales only this does not have 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.000
 description or anything has only the cover of 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.220
 four versions that is similarly the cover 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.950
 and tesco had posted on their site 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.630
 few days ago and according to this site 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.190
 then we would not have versions giving 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.500
 new generation or at least not for 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.870
 while it is not then stay there one more 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.430
 love to join the list 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.350
 I think we'll stay in doubt. 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.850
 always until the official announcement happens 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:36.250
 so while it does not happen to us 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.810
 wait and only speculate even then 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.860
 it's basically this news I 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.390
 I wanted to bring you today a 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.340
 news came fast 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:45.130
 comment below you think if you 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.500
 They find that really change dn 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:49.300
 this year would be a good option and you 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.040
 also share the fear that they 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.669
 I have the issue of gameplay does not stay 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.500
 fluid 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:54.610
 I do not know your opinions on the most is 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.740
 This, you must have realized 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.850
 I found the background today was from mw3 in 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.620
 video that I posted yesterday a lot of people 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:03.460
 talking to the infinity ward code does not 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:05.830
 brings game play of funding w20 w3 valeu 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.990
 bike was good for running here more 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.910
 in law, and there you said that and I 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.040
 I have no more mw3 gameplay saved on 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.710
 pc and 92 much less then have to go back 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.150
 to play the game to get game 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.590
 place so today I played a little bit 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.180
 able to play following you will see 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.740
 If I go back to play some more in the 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.390
 days to bring 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.550
 background from time to time in these videos 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:26.169
 information about this year's car 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.580
 right, that 's it, I hope they have 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:28.930
 liked it liked but wants to leave 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.850
 simple cell phone your favorite 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:33.160

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:34.660
 to be arriving in stores the post in the case 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.610
 this year and should start to leak 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.840
 so more videos will see this week and 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.830
 which should be the week of the announcement of the 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.690
 code 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.980
