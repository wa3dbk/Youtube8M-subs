okay what do you got what sort of

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.890 
okay what do you got what sort of
battery<00:01:20.190> technology<00:01:20.670> using<00:01:21.150> we're<00:01:21.720> using

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
battery technology using we're using

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.620 
battery technology using we're using
lithium<00:01:22.320> ion<00:01:22.800> batteries<00:01:23.250> okay<00:01:24.120> this<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.450> the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
lithium ion batteries okay this to the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.350 
lithium ion batteries okay this to the
some<00:01:25.560> type<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.770> stuff<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.010> the<00:01:26.220> test<00:01:26.430> Levin<00:01:26.729> yes

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
some type of stuff is the test Levin yes

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.580 
some type of stuff is the test Levin yes
yes<00:01:27.600> that's<00:01:27.750> correct<00:01:27.930> I'm<00:01:28.260> all<00:01:28.410> sort<00:01:28.560> of

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
with it once it's completed in all

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.749 
with it once it's completed in all
tested<00:01:59.220> we<00:01:59.850> are<00:02:00.390> going<00:02:00.660> to<00:02:00.750> take<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.229> from<00:02:01.759> from

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
tested we are going to take it from from

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.370 
tested we are going to take it from from
Hamilton<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.240> Christchurch<00:02:03.660> so<00:02:04.020> we're<00:02:04.200> taking

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
Hamilton to Christchurch so we're taking

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.380 
Hamilton to Christchurch so we're taking
it<00:02:04.590> down<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:05.190> velocity<00:02:05.580> it's<00:02:06.119> like<00:02:06.270> an

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
it down to a velocity it's like an

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.760 
it down to a velocity it's like an
electric<00:02:06.750> vehicle<00:02:07.020> condition<00:02:07.410> and

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
electric vehicle condition and

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.889 
electric vehicle condition and
Christchurch<00:02:08.069> so<00:02:08.940> yeah<00:02:09.360> that's<00:02:09.509> our<00:02:09.690> plan

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
yeah this is the entire team that built

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.559 
yeah this is the entire team that built
this<00:02:12.090> thing<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:12.420> here<00:02:12.540> we<00:02:12.600> go<00:02:12.750> I<00:02:12.990> will<00:02:13.530> I<00:02:13.800> will

this thing and here we go I will I will
and<00:02:15.650> yeah<00:02:16.650> kajal<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:17.610> area<00:02:18.180> yep<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.200> had

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
and yeah kajal and area yep and you had

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.350 
and yeah kajal and area yep and you had
a<00:02:19.319> good<00:02:19.440> time<00:02:19.560> building<00:02:19.800> this<00:02:19.920> and<00:02:20.910> this<00:02:21.210> is

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
a good time building this and this is

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.500 
a good time building this and this is
like<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.510> university<00:02:22.080> project<00:02:22.230> is<00:02:22.560> it<00:02:23.240> cool<00:02:24.240> and

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
like a university project is it cool and

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.800 
like a university project is it cool and
who<00:02:25.080> gets<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.380> keep<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:25.620> at<00:02:25.710> the<00:02:25.800> end<00:02:26.270> oh<00:02:27.270> bugger

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
who gets to keep it at the end oh bugger

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.740 
who gets to keep it at the end oh bugger
right<00:02:28.910> so<00:02:29.910> will<00:02:30.030> you<00:02:30.090> be<00:02:30.180> down<00:02:30.330> take<00:02:30.569> her<00:02:30.660> out

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
right so will you be down take her out

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.860 
right so will you be down take her out
again<00:02:30.900> testing<00:02:31.380> this<00:02:31.520> is<00:02:32.520> definitely<00:02:32.940> yeah<00:02:33.120> ok

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
again testing this is definitely yeah ok

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:34.970 
again testing this is definitely yeah ok
what's<00:02:34.020> your<00:02:34.080> testing<00:02:34.440> point<00:02:34.590> in<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:34.890> next

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
what's your testing point in the next

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.530 
what's your testing point in the next
