feel<00:03:41.750> like<00:03:41.900> that's<00:03:42.110> been<00:03:42.290> a<00:03:42.739> reason<00:03:43.130> that<00:03:43.250> I've

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
feel like that's been a reason that I've

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.710 
feel like that's been a reason that I've
been<00:03:43.489> able<00:03:43.670> to<00:03:43.790> grow<00:03:43.970> my<00:03:44.000> hair<00:03:44.120> out<00:03:44.300> so<00:03:44.569> long

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
been able to grow my hair out so long

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.670 
been able to grow my hair out so long
and<00:03:44.989> it's<00:03:45.650> because<00:03:46.040> I<00:03:46.340> deep<00:03:46.970> condition<00:03:47.680> weekly

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
and it's because I deep condition weekly

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.009 
and it's because I deep condition weekly
and<00:03:49.220> I<00:03:49.459> feel<00:03:49.670> like<00:03:49.790> that<00:03:49.970> helps<00:03:50.870> retain

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
and I feel like that helps retain

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:52.540 
and I feel like that helps retain
moisture<00:03:51.230> and<00:03:51.620> it<00:03:51.830> stops<00:03:52.070> a<00:03:52.220> lot<00:03:52.340> of<00:03:52.489> the

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
moisture and it stops a lot of the

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.150 
moisture and it stops a lot of the
breakage<00:03:52.970> right<00:03:53.870> now<00:03:54.140> I'm<00:03:54.380> at<00:03:54.530> about<00:03:54.620> waist
