00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
okay people die and then you can't

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.139 
okay people die and then you can't

idea<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.810> not<00:01:31.200> climbing<00:01:31.799> was<00:01:32.250> too<00:01:32.520> much<00:01:32.729> to

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
idea of not climbing was too much to

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.080 
idea of not climbing was too much to
imagine<00:01:33.689> I've<00:01:34.619> got<00:01:34.920> two<00:01:35.159> kids<00:01:35.399> my<00:01:35.819> wife's

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
go if we go for it there's a probability

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.020 
go if we go for it there's a probability
that<00:01:44.459> we<00:01:44.819> might<00:01:45.000> going<00:01:45.179> to<00:01:45.270> come<00:01:45.630> back<00:01:46.939> am<00:01:47.939> i

taking too many chances can I control
the<00:01:50.039> risk<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.490> course<00:01:50.789> you<00:01:50.909> can't<00:01:51.179> control<00:01:51.479> the

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
the risk of course you can't control the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.649 
the risk of course you can't control the
risk<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:52.200> was<00:01:52.319> something<00:01:52.679> that<00:01:52.709> I<00:01:52.860> had<00:01:53.039> to<00:01:53.189> do

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
risk it was something that I had to do

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.459 
risk it was something that I had to do
it<00:01:55.200> was<00:01:55.439> conrad<00:01:56.070> saying<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:57.180> can<00:01:57.360> do<00:01:57.479> this<00:01:57.509> he

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
it was conrad saying you can do this he

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.370 
it was conrad saying you can do this he
knew<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:59.039> we<00:01:59.579> had<00:01:59.820> to<00:01:59.850> trust<00:02:00.329> him<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.869> that's

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
knew that we had to trust him and that's

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.490 
knew that we had to trust him and that's
what<00:02:01.530> we<00:02:01.619> did<00:02:01.799> we<00:02:02.460> had<00:02:02.759> become<00:02:03.210> so<00:02:03.600> close<00:02:03.869> it

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
what we did we had become so close it

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.650 
what we did we had become so close it
was<00:02:04.649> worth<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.070> risk<00:02:05.479> it<00:02:06.479> was<00:02:06.720> worth

was worth the risk it was worth

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.350
