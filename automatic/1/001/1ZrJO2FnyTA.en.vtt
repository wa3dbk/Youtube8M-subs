00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.870
 after of course there are some worries with the 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.840
 authorities in the sense that I know since 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.130
 for a month and a half we meet 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.750
 difficulties we personally in the 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.509
 central station because there is the operation 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.949
 thermos that took monopoly actually they 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.680
 have created a schedule in which they have 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.020
 so incorporate associations one 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.699
 creates an assembly to which we 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.039
 was not invited so we did not have 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.539
 knowledge and one day we meet them 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.060
 so at the central station where even goes out that 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.199
 we do the same thing as us and they 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.759
 we have outright hunting and from there they 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.090
 send us the police to get them 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.620
 go 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.079
 the police made us understand that he 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.450
 needed an authorization and therefore the 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.420
 steps are underway but here is this 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.010
 a ridiculous conflict in the sense that 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.660
 working together is the solution 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.820
 complementarity 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.410
 but unfortunately one she does not see 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.449
 from this angle that we thought she 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.820
 competition in associations that 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.989
 help the poor 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.920
 I do not know what their interest is in 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.809
 to want to monopolize the central station 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.270
 but in any case it's competition 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.519
 and she's really misplaced yeah 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.729
 because we have a common goal 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.799
 bring some food and 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.830
 warmth to these people we are not there 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.270
 to pretend to be kings 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.700
 from the central station to have the monopoly 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.990
 but it's still to follow 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.420
 because we are in the process 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.070
 we are waiting for the answers in fact of the 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.909
 commune etc to find out if we can 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:31.110
 continue to Paris Central Station for 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:33.600
 you yes quite they tried to 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.060
 hunt several times but we talked 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.990
 with a manager and made us 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.340
 understand that it also needed 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.579
 authorization to distribute in the 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.579
 central Station 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.550
 it's without authorization they have the right to 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.590
 to hunt because it's wrong to say that 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.060
 the present thermos and is recognized by 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.960
 tariffs are subsidized every 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.340
 associations working with at 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.780
 prince also demanded 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.250
 so they have accounts to render to 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.190
 the state so everything should not prepared 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.380
 they had to distribute so on one side 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.880
 it's understandable but the other side 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.160
 is that we have not been invited to 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.190
 the other organization that would be when 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.780
 even great to have to succeed 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.740
 that's not the fight for the 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.470
 the same objective, but we have 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:20.190
 tried to work with them they are 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:22.650
 not really but really not that for 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.300
 that's it without closing on it they 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.180
 not want they do not want to work 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.140
 with us they made us understand 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.730
 it could could their 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.250
 leave their car that was distributing 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.630
 us in our place they should not want 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.360
 also understand that they only distributes 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.670
 no halal food and there is 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.080
 a lot of Muslims that they are 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.350
 made nice understand and talk with them 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.760
 they do not want to change their meals and 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.250
 what they give them is because 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.420
 that we give ourselves we needed I 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.580
 would prefer to come and eat at our place 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.280
 than at home and sometimes it does not come back 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.250
 because it would end up with 50 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:03:00.480
 50 for not hot to throw yeah they have 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.019
 afraid that you islamized all his voices 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.299
 students 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:07.500
 maybe do not know with meat 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:08.700
 it's magic so that's what we 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.930
 find it personally hurt 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.190
 frankly not what good you do 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.220
 I have to go to the central station at 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.900
 Wednesday night 19 20 hours ago two 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.850
 distribution stands in the same 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.670
 corridor of Central Station there are two 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.810
 son unfortunately for them moms 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.450
 who cook for us make dishes 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.340
 excellent and therefore homeless and prefers 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.130
 eat with us that tasty food 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.320
 energy dishes that you 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.030
 know all so they prefer to do 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.019
 the queue at home and so have we 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.489
 not the meat is good one 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:45.690
 gives the strength that fills the 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:51.090
 belly and that's from abn soft so they 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:52.620
 are not there so here is good hot meal 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.690
 of village and patio which are well 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.250
 consisting 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.980
 and here we are not criticizing at all 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.830
 that they do them but we will say that the 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.310
 sdf has the right to choose who will 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.740
 eat them 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:08.530
 but you are not against who is 2 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.210
 we say two stands we are not 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.610
 but against even offered them 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.180
 to align their stand with ours so that he 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.620
 may have 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.420
 we will say more choices in what 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.860
 in what they want to eat etc but 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:23.220
 that was categorical it's no 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:23.220
