00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.970
 twentieth issue of my project story 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.039
 locations of world of warcraft and in this 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.300
 release I will tell you about this location 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.720
 like silver forest 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.849
 well then let's start tall pines with 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.060
 beautiful silver king towers 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.130
 over the overgrown bumps but at night off the ground 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.390
 here fog and moonlight rise 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.160
 plays in them its dance of light and shadow 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.340
 silver forest sprawled along 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.950
 west coast of lordderon from the south region 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.649
 bordered by kill forest from the southeast forest 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.950
 passes in Hillsbrad Foothills and north 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.660
 settled down is volske and forests 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.719
 natural eastern border serves 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.820
 knot lords world the influence of the plague on 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.020
 silver forest is not as strong as 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.539
 tirisfal alice 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.520
 however, its manifestation on plants and on 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.880
 animals inhabiting the area here 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:09.780
 visible to the naked story 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.610
 silver bur in those times when these 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.100
 the land belonged to the alliance 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.430
 pore probably resembled a forest of internal 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.470
 lands located far to the east 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.650
 among the forest there were stretching 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.509
 Road farmland and mines but in 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.110
 much silverware remained 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.509
 untouched and beautiful with 3 war and not 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.630
 there is no one left who cares about 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.750
 the fate of boron in lordderon raged 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.240
 battles dalaran lay in ruins while the inhabitants 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.369
 Guinness broke all ties with the world 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.790
 imagining the terrain to ourselves 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.040
 whether they were also struck by the magical plague that 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.310
 swept and lordderon and turned 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.340
 its eastern regions to the plaguelands in 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.170
 the region was invaded by the troops 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.000
 subjecting him to devastation but im not 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.579
 destined to dominate long 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.399
 local places with weakening power 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.680
 lich king before homogeneous mass 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.329
 the undead split against the denied 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.080
 which entrenched 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.210
 and here 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.540
 Southwestern Silver Forest 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.670
 the tip of their possessions are now 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.610
 and those who challenge their rights to these 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.760
 land many inhabitants are frightened 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.500
 impending plague and the living dead 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.590
 tried to hide in the south in seeming 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.870
 more secure land guinness feet 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.820
 blew shut shut himself off 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.770
 rest of the world stone wall 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.620
 known as the wall of gray hair 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.350
 at the closed gate are still 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.840
 refugees camped here temporary camp 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:43.100
 hope that they still let in but how 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.959
 you can see it vain hopes renounced 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.090
 successfully settled in silver grove 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.950
 old settlements were significantly 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.890
 reinforced and many new ones appeared 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.230
 strongholds of the renounced thanks to 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.450
 they had direct access to this 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.050
 send troops to the foothills of Hillsbrad and 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.480
 there grab new areas they took off 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.820
 threats from murlocs destroying and in the village 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.459
 finally the most noticeable 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:11.519
 changes are restructuring of all 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.890
 settlements in the style of the renounced people and 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.630
 culture 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.810
 silver forest or rather significant his 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.310
 the part is controlled by the Forsaken 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.230
 freed from the king's control 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.239
 lich 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.790
 experiencing burning hatred for the lash they 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.709
 most often do not make special exceptions 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.060
 and for the living 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.340
 trying to set over the region 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.190
 absolute control the dead keeps 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.630
 there is a certain military contingent 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.430
 guardian of death who vigilantly 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.070
 patrols silver forest 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.920
 hardly anyone knows where they came from 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.900
 on the rotten skin and the denied lead 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.140
 constant guerilla warfare friend 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:52.320
 against each other in the Silver forest were 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.660
 and living desperate men and women 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.870
 doomed holding defense against 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:01.100
 Forsaken though there are dalaran magicians 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:04.010
 arrived here for research purposes 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.720
 dalaran equips defensively 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.239
 research expeditions in many ways 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.910
 it is thanks to them in the rare local 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:14.100
 the villages still live on 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.950
 southwest of forest stands village 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.720
 funeral pyres and towering over 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:22.110
 her dark fang fortress 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.630
 at night when rising above the tops 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:27.600
 trees the moon washes its pale 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:30.270
 light from the fortress and the village are distributed 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.990
 terrible howls as if they are inhabited 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.140
 wolves 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:36.300
 one of the rules that quickly learn 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.630
 travelers caught in silver 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.390
 boron 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.390
 you should not leave the village at night and yes 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:44.580
 generally go out 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:47.160
 those who know whisper a curse to existing ones 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.500
 in this place but rare people show 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.440
 the desire to find out what is behind these 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.690
 rumors one of these people is 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:58.170
 magician dalaran named alpha with 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:00.420
 talkative he doesn't seem interested 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.080
 only curse war genes like him him 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.570
 calls 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.000
 but strange behavior of native animals 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.720
 now let's take a look 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.480
 geography of silver boron 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.890
 silver forest huge virgin forest 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.980
 trailing along a ragged western 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:19.440
 coast lordderon local rather 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:23.010
 plains although often small 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:26.460
 hills mossy overhangs hanging over 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:28.710
 slopes and grass bumps are found 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:32.580
 separate dilapidated farms and 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:35.610
 empty gold mines region can 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.680
 describe in a word thrown between 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.050
 trees are roaming many wild beasts 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:43.770
 who behave more aggressively than 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:46.919
