00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.939
 O worst of it oie in Brazil there I will 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.789
 show you guys today will fix it 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.369
 a basic recipe even more 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.810
 because I believe that I feel in the image 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.600
 as I told you do anything by 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.730
 see from now on you are interested 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.010
 because you can toggle called by 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.320
 cause of taste or simply with 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.960
 the cream dog that I think you 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.960
 now I hope you like it and I will 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:50.070
 start building that basic cream 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:53.600
 it contains one liter of whole milk goes 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.600
 open the box because of everything 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.710
 ready 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.220
 a can of condensed milk also 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.220
 want to 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.440
 Oh good 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.610
 two twins 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:52.100
 and for today's 4 tablespoons starches 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:55.760
 of corn or zena each show with a 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.760
 coffin buy daughter 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.530
 good 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:13.420
 I do not have four spoons world full 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.810
 I like too much not to get too strong. 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.450
 because the maize is just to leave the pasta 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.730
 built-in for later when you 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.830
 you have to see everything ready and has passed 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.360
 a refrigerator that you cut and did not 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.340
 there is a chance that he will be 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.020
 more wines are from the country 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.270
 that's why I could stay with the 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.520
 well-divided calls like I said if 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.800
 you want to put the flavors of 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.530
 chocolate for example you put me 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.480
 I can talk now, it does not have good consideration. 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.489
 specific because people who like to 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.520
 rock animals to show you 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:48.010
 So you'll leave with five more. 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.880
 mega chocolate for example since it fell 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.040
 of the gift 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.450
 if you prefer to use kakÃ¡ a powder 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.050
 especially if it is in the concentration of 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.989
 50% + 3 college will be more efficient 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.489
 that occurs is one of the strongest 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.130
 make this effect in taste 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.920
 chocolate really has more indicated 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.350
 so now I'm going to stir this cream you 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.090
 will not he play the whole time? 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.489
 Will not stop messing with the story. 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.760
 that using alone to move has an outline 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.680
 until it reaches a certain consciousness 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.760
 We will return to show how 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.760
 French thought 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:41.220
 it took 15 10 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.060
 goes there in the cause of the video and the consistency 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.340
 and this 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.780
 She 's a lot like a cool when 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.460
 you do 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.310
 man down and to eat breakfast 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.290
 At last, awareness is like this and even a 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.140
 just under a hot planet because 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:04:00.870
 then horn and thin well defined layer 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:02.640
 but was thus the mayor including 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.590
 while you're leaving you have to 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.050
 impression that it may have begun in 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.550
 pilot but did not ask him why 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.840
 when this awareness comes to you 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.430
 turn off the liner 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.410
 What did you think she did? 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.990
 she let loose she gets everything 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:21.540
 so smooth and even 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:23.840
 Now I'm going to do the assembly for the dance. 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:27.810
 It's how you started using sport. 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.730
 morning of their sewage in milk 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.680
 amount of milk is as much as 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.230
 need to understand the dish is not even 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.780
 full 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:40.640
 If they need to put more and I'll put 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:51.960
 a layer of biscuit and more cherished 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:52.980
 monk words clear first layer of 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.010
 biscuit 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:59.310
 I just completed the farm to finish 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:02.100
 with when possible to start 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:06.350
 put it like I said I like it 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.350
 very generous layers of credit 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.400
 For who likes the sport too much? 

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:25.949
 automotive - cream is likely to 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.900
 conclusive whole package up 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:30.240
 so if you like a lot of biscuit 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.860
 that I suggest starting with just getting started 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.500
 recipe with two packages for you not 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:41.639
 stay in the hand and suddenly see that there is left 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:43.650
 Credit lacked explain there now will 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:48.379
 put the last layer of plasma house 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.379
 from short krebs cookie to finish 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:56.069
 I did a total of three pharmacies or 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:57.840
 can see the layers of 

00:05:56.069 --> 00:06:00.210
 with a focus because this is not just 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.159
 when you cut into the food 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:09.030
 I made three layers of biscuit that 

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:10.860
 of top stage still km later in 2008 by 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.560
 last of cream 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.270
 I have to see here because as I said 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.310
 to see it simple and to see that the staff 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.680
 What do you like most? 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.960
 however, it is very common for people to 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.610
 clear about what we have today is 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.479
 easier to talk about table two 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.270
 eggs 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:29.940
 the matic person in the mixer does now 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:31.680
 adds adds sugar and puts the 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.199
 scenery of a sigh 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:37.130
 or else if you want account chantine 

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:39.779
 praxe chile that only hits the mixer 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:42.000
 other general identifier was fair 

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:43.440
 becomes better consistent and does not 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.599
 can only put it on top because 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.090
 here is another ornament with the 

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:50.039
 complement or even if you want to leave 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:52.110
 can use gelatine and faults more 

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:54.990
 we relax only if you have only 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:57.950
 if you had authorized the father and more 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:59.930
 options for embellishment with finishing 

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:02.830
 think that you are ready and that the young 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:05.510
 now only germany refrigerator until shred 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:07.940
 me too hot now not 

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:09.440
 put it in the fridge now it 's because you 

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.970
 should not put things too hot in the 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.840
 that this can damage your 

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.460
 refrigerator 

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.100
 so I hope to cool down a bit like this 

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:18.230
 in another environment nor do I place 

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.950
 model the technique aside everyone see 

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:20.990
 with me 

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:24.320
 I usually make the image two hours 

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:26.960
 before signing the dj because it was already 

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:29.840
 on my support as you have you're 

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:32.810
 reach a revenue was this 

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:35.180
 I hope that once existed liked 

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:38.320
 I hope she plays if I'm here in the 

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:38.320
 video and far
