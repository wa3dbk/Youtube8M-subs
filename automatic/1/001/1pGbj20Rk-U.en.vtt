00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 to increase life expectancy even more 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.440
 sets the medicine today also 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.269
 getting better diagnostic procedures one 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.490
 absolute revolution in this area 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.030
 seems to be the so-called somatom 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.350
 in ten seconds this new one can 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.570
 Computer tomograph in detail to the 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.520
 example the whole body of 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.590
 examine seriously injured patients 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.449
 and even a bowel massage without 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.550
 endoscope is possible with it 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.130
 nationwide he is only in 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.439
 Wiesbaden in action 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.300
 It's a day like 100 others before too 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.070
 in the radiological department of 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.489
 horst schmidt clinic always wiesbaden 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.559
 breathe and hold the air 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.390
 and yet something is very different since 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.460
 Most recently, you work here with 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.280
 one of the fastest computer 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:51.270
 tomographers of the world the so-called 128 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.699
 he 128 that means at every rotation of the 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.910
 ct around the patient becomes a picture 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.520
 of the human body dissected into 128 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.469
 layers created in a record time 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.730
 from just over three 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.730
 seconds per revolution 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.390
 Full body scanners, so to speak, from the skull 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.369
 To the sole of the foot takes ten seconds 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.530
 we've had a polytrauma the other day 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.460
 that was a big one for us for the first time 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.650
 experience in which it is very important 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.470
 things went we had to act fast 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.299
 I took the time from area 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.040
 of the head to the sensible feet so 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.720
 The output of the basin was eight 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.180
 seconds 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.340
 is inseparably connected to the 128 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.110
 his so-called workstation the 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.360
 Processing place at the professor 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.090
 Weigand and his colleague dollars the 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.799
 once again, the pictures taken are at rest 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.119
 can analyze 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.280
 please play the tubes please 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.710
 the main artery is all free 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.360
 continuous and the calotte is 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.300
 unremarkable in total so no 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.010
 Note on a bell fracture 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.440
 the patient has had no luck 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.330
 serious injury 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.160
 the special thing about this workstation 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.350
 is that we have the possibility 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:10.030
 have an extraordinarily good one 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:13.270
 Resolving all woven structures in the 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.430
 connected or isolated among all 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.530
 to consider possible angles 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.780
 that is, when we overlay 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.180
 of the bone some vessels 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.709
 can not recognize structures 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.630
 we the possibility of the bones 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.239
 to put aside and this in one 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.790
 of course, a tremendously high resolution 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:34.420
 certain degree of spatial capacity 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:37.540
 just to understand exactly 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.400
 in advance in advance how do I have to now 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.100
 turn my examination layer and 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:46.150
 turn around certain structures optimally 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.709
 to detect bleeding tumors and lungs 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.810
 heart studies, it is the 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.330
 so to speak, classic fields of application 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.010
 a cts but also in the investigation 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.170
 of the bowel the tomograph always comes 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.390
 more often for use quickly and with 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.160
 brilliant pictures he replaces those of 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.890
 many felt uncomfortable 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.320
 bow reflection or the area of 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.410
 pain treatment this patient suffers 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.489
 for months on problems in the left leg 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.430
 lengthy episode of nerve inflammation 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:20.380
 in the lumbar area if you are customer 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:22.239
 the ct creates his pictures professor 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.920
 weigand examined the spot inflammatory 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.660
 and misses her position comes the 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.690
 Nervenwurzel out there I want to go 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.690
 in order to get there I have to measure or 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.940
 Center line to the left six centimeters 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.850
 and at an oblique angle of incidence 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:41.200
 I am the access to the neuro before 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:43.720
 poor lbk 34 left side away the 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.700
 coordinates now they become whole 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.110
 simply with marker on the back of the 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.250
 transferred to patients 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.830
 Point 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.660
 frame the way differently in europe 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.390
 approach there is local anesthesia 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.520
 small stage through the skin at the 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.800
 A needle is placed in the stunned place 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.980
 then the last control is the 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.200
 painful point that is so 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.780
 can now only a cannula and then 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.860
 through it an analgesic solution 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.860
 be injected 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.370
 nagl out with this is the investigation 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.799
 finished finished in less than five 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:25.300
 minutes thanks to the experience of doctors and 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:27.520
 thanks to the fast 128 he gives great 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.810
 it's the newest cd generation with the man 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.440
 really all sorts of diseases 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.110
 can recognize 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.700
 but if a pregnant woman is in 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.650
 the clinic will come then too 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.110
 ever without help her baby on the 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.660
 toilet to bring world heard right 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.280
 this happened at the Klinikum Oldenburg as 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.470
 a 17-year-old with complaints 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.950
 Maybe Vienna in the hospital 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.950
 coming
