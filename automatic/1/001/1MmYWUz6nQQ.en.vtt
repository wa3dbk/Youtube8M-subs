ingenuity today with another video of my
guitar<00:00:15.700> question<00:00:16.180> series<00:00:16.690> so<00:00:16.900> today's

guitar question series so today's

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.430 
guitar question series so today's
question<00:00:17.830> is<00:00:17.980> how<00:00:18.850> often<00:00:19.570> does<00:00:19.780> my<00:00:19.990> guitar

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:20.440 
question is how often does my guitar

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.220 
question is how often does my guitar
need<00:00:20.680> new<00:00:20.980> screams<00:00:21.490> or<00:00:22.030> how<00:00:22.330> often<00:00:22.810> do<00:00:22.930> I<00:00:22.990> need

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 
need new screams or how often do I need

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.070 
need new screams or how often do I need
to<00:00:23.260> change<00:00:23.650> the<00:00:23.860> strings<00:00:24.100> on<00:00:24.370> a<00:00:24.400> guitar<00:00:24.490> um<00:00:25.120> and

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.080 
to change the strings on a guitar um and

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.760 
to change the strings on a guitar um and
I<00:00:26.680> think<00:00:27.070> you<00:00:27.160> can<00:00:27.190> ask<00:00:27.370> 10<00:00:28.120> different

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:28.770 
I think you can ask 10 different

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.690 
I think you can ask 10 different
guitarists<00:00:29.770> you'll<00:00:29.890> probably<00:00:30.160> get<00:00:30.400> 10

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:30.700 
guitarists you'll probably get 10

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.299 
guitarists you'll probably get 10
different<00:00:30.730> answers<00:00:31.270> I<00:00:31.860> think<00:00:32.860> I'd<00:00:33.100> mean

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
different answers I think I'd mean

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:35.400 
different answers I think I'd mean
there's<00:00:33.550> really<00:00:33.760> no<00:00:34.090> hard<00:00:34.480> and<00:00:34.629> fast<00:00:34.750> rules

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
there's really no hard and fast rules

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.529 
there's really no hard and fast rules
you<00:00:35.739> changed<00:00:36.160> restraints<00:00:36.789> whenever<00:00:37.120> you<00:00:37.300> feel

00:00:37.529 --> 00:00:37.539 
you changed restraints whenever you feel

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:41.160 
you changed restraints whenever you feel
like<00:00:37.600> um<00:00:38.200> they<00:00:38.530> just<00:00:38.920> don't<00:00:39.190> sound<00:00:39.870> as<00:00:40.870> good

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
like um they just don't sound as good

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.440 
like um they just don't sound as good
anymore<00:00:41.500> or<00:00:41.980> when<00:00:42.190> they<00:00:42.340> start<00:00:42.670> feeling<00:00:42.940> weird

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.450 
anymore or when they start feeling weird

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.140 
anymore or when they start feeling weird
um<00:00:43.860> for<00:00:44.860> a<00:00:44.890> beginner<00:00:45.040> that<00:00:45.460> might<00:00:45.670> be<00:00:45.880> a<00:00:45.910> little

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.150 
um for a beginner that might be a little

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.440 
um for a beginner that might be a little
bit<00:00:46.390> difficult<00:00:46.630> to<00:00:47.340> really<00:00:48.340> determine<00:00:48.610> when<00:00:49.300> a

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.450 
bit difficult to really determine when a

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.319 
bit difficult to really determine when a
string<00:00:49.960> is<00:00:50.140> really<00:00:50.530> new<00:00:50.850> versus<00:00:51.850> a<00:00:51.880> string

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
string is really new versus a string

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:54.060 
string is really new versus a string
that<00:00:52.510> has<00:00:52.720> been<00:00:53.020> on<00:00:53.140> the<00:00:53.170> instrument<00:00:53.649> for<00:00:54.040> a

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
that has been on the instrument for a

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.880 
that has been on the instrument for a
while<00:00:54.310> and<00:00:54.550> possibly<00:00:55.120> needs<00:00:55.420> a<00:00:55.570> change

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
while and possibly needs a change

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.460 
while and possibly needs a change
sometimes<00:00:56.890> you<00:00:57.070> can<00:00:57.370> see<00:00:57.730> the<00:00:58.149> arm<00:00:58.540> when<00:00:59.200> the

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 
sometimes you can see the arm when the

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.470 
sometimes you can see the arm when the
condition<00:00:59.980> of<00:01:00.130> the<00:01:00.340> strings<00:01:00.700> especially<00:01:01.360> the

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
condition of the strings especially the

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.380 
condition of the strings especially the
bass<00:01:01.690> strings<00:01:02.140> so<00:01:02.680> essentially<00:01:03.040> you<00:01:03.760> can<00:01:03.970> tell

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
bass strings so essentially you can tell

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.899 
bass strings so essentially you can tell
when<00:01:04.659> they're<00:01:04.899> when<00:01:05.799> there's<00:01:06.009> some<00:01:06.280> some<00:01:06.610> wear

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
when they're when there's some some wear

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:08.459 
when they're when there's some some wear
and<00:01:06.939> tear<00:01:07.210> on<00:01:07.450> them<00:01:07.780> and<00:01:07.930> when<00:01:08.079> they're<00:01:08.259> ready

00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:08.469 
and tear on them and when they're ready

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:12.210 
and tear on them and when they're ready
for<00:01:08.560> a<00:01:09.040> replacement<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:10.689> general<00:01:11.290> if<00:01:11.680> you<00:01:11.950> play

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
for a replacement in general if you play

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.730 
for a replacement in general if you play
frequently<00:01:12.880> let's<00:01:13.120> just<00:01:13.450> say<00:01:13.659> you<00:01:14.200> play<00:01:14.470> every

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
frequently let's just say you play every

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.190 
frequently let's just say you play every
day<00:01:15.070> for<00:01:15.700> half<00:01:16.060> an<00:01:16.240> hour<00:01:16.360> an<00:01:16.630> hour<00:01:16.810> or<00:01:17.170> two

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
day for half an hour an hour or two

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.399 
day for half an hour an hour or two
hours<00:01:17.440> then<00:01:18.280> I<00:01:18.340> would<00:01:18.610> think<00:01:19.090> that<00:01:19.240> on<00:01:19.720> like

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
hours then I would think that on like

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:22.350 
hours then I would think that on like
every<00:01:20.860> month<00:01:21.130> or<00:01:21.460> every<00:01:21.490> two<00:01:21.790> months<00:01:22.120> you

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
every month or every two months you

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.149 
every month or every two months you
should<00:01:22.390> definitely<00:01:22.750> change<00:01:23.470> your<00:01:23.740> strings

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
should definitely change your strings

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.640 
should definitely change your strings
however<00:01:24.880> I<00:01:24.970> have<00:01:25.090> some<00:01:25.510> of<00:01:25.690> my<00:01:25.840> guitars<00:01:26.320> I

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
however I have some of my guitars I

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.399 
however I have some of my guitars I
changed<00:01:27.280> two<00:01:27.369> strings<00:01:27.820> maybe<00:01:28.180> four<00:01:28.930> times<00:01:29.200> a

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
changed two strings maybe four times a

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.590 
changed two strings maybe four times a
year<00:01:29.440> or<00:01:29.830> something<00:01:30.010> like<00:01:30.430> that<00:01:30.490> well<00:01:31.330> one

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
year or something like that well one

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.570 
year or something like that well one
more<00:01:32.020> guitar<00:01:32.440> that<00:01:32.619> I<00:01:32.650> hardly<00:01:33.040> play<00:01:33.280> ever<00:01:33.490> i

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
more guitar that I hardly play ever i

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.359 
more guitar that I hardly play ever i
play<00:01:33.940> i<00:01:34.180> changed<00:01:34.720> the<00:01:34.780> strains<00:01:35.140> maybe<00:01:35.470> twice<00:01:36.159> a

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
play i changed the strains maybe twice a

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.370 
play i changed the strains maybe twice a
year<00:01:36.640> so<00:01:37.090> again<00:01:37.390> there<00:01:37.600> are<00:01:37.689> no<00:01:37.869> hard<00:01:38.170> and<00:01:38.290> fast

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
year so again there are no hard and fast

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.920 
year so again there are no hard and fast
rules<00:01:38.950> but<00:01:39.250> there<00:01:39.430> are<00:01:39.580> certain<00:01:40.060> conditions

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
rules but there are certain conditions

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.039 
rules but there are certain conditions
are<00:01:41.290> like<00:01:42.280> the<00:01:42.640> like<00:01:43.000> humidity<00:01:43.330> and<00:01:43.750> air

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
are like the like humidity and air

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.440 
are like the like humidity and air
temperature<00:01:44.740> that<00:01:45.010> cannot<00:01:45.369> have<00:01:45.850> an<00:01:46.060> effect

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
temperature that cannot have an effect

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.260 
temperature that cannot have an effect
on<00:01:46.630> the<00:01:46.930> condition<00:01:47.500> of<00:01:47.619> your<00:01:47.710> strings<00:01:48.430> I<00:01:48.640> could

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
on the condition of your strings I could

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.060 
on the condition of your strings I could
give<00:01:49.360> you<00:01:49.479> one<00:01:49.659> example<00:01:49.689> that<00:01:50.320> happened<00:01:50.770> to<00:01:50.920> me

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
give you one example that happened to me

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.880 
give you one example that happened to me
when<00:01:51.310> I<00:01:51.369> was<00:01:51.490> um<00:01:52.180> when<00:01:53.140> I<00:01:53.170> had<00:01:53.439> my<00:01:53.470> little

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
I had one of my guitars that are used

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.390 
I had one of my guitars that are used
for<00:02:00.000> four<00:02:01.000> videos<00:02:01.299> instructions<00:02:02.229> a<00:02:02.470> sitting

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
for four videos instructions a sitting

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.690 
for four videos instructions a sitting
in<00:02:03.579> the<00:02:03.850> garage<00:02:03.970> after<00:02:04.869> a<00:02:04.900> couple<00:02:05.170> of<00:02:05.350> weeks

in the garage after a couple of weeks

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.279 
in the garage after a couple of weeks
understood<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:07.570> strings<00:02:07.869> had<00:02:08.049> some

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
understood the strings had some
