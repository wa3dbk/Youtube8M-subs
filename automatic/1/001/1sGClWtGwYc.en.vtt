00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:18.189

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:21.970
 why are not we going to start with a game 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.880
 that touches all the themes that they 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.949
 after all, usually as an axis, so 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.039
 let's start let's talk a 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.210
 little bit of this good egg we continue 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:35.039
 here and now is what I favor 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.039
 pretend is that the chairs 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.850
 and you're watching a cinematic scene 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:46.769
 make the payment exercised briatore no 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.769
 you lose the symbolism of better 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:53.980
 the game is full of symbology 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.130
 illuminant and others to the same mouth 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.340
 check the payment cap 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.750
 and what we do deals to punish 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:04.470
 leave in your dead to the city council 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.210
 let's call blonde we continue and now 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.520
 let's go back talking a little about the 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.550
 game and the whole theme that surrounds them 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.560
 both real and the one that adorns the 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.560
 game now we continue companions 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.420
 good as you can see I'm making progress 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.520
 because this is kinematics a bit 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.810
 see egg and it's a bit with action here 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.250
 you're greeting the colors nothing with 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.679
 the brunette removes the blondes came to 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.840
 beginning and the cat which face 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:31.979
 silly and I do not like anything right now 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.750
 now they will talk a little notice of 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.490
 what is the roll of becoming the 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.619
 briatore that is the turkey that is going to 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.479
 stroll the Venice of the twenty - first century no 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.759
 I perish and that she gets into the 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.399
 cults of the assassin or smokers 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.959
 you see, so that's what you got 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.220
 talkative let's hit another jump 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:51.740
 go ahead, gentlemen, this is interesting 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.630
 and here we have the friend sitting is 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.130
 see the animus the animus that is the device 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.150
 that gives meaning to the whole game that is the 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.920
 that moves you to become 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:04.610
 writer is a banker from venice 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.390
 of the 10th century if we are not wrong there 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.280
 we go 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.229
 here the mapping is already being done 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.780
 you are seeing the truth that the game 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.550
 presents a beautiful realism and is 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.680
 it only makes part of many more parts 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.790
 I have really enjoyed playing 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.310
 because I am distracted by the truth 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.650
 has as I say a recreation of the 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.180
 city is very good is very distracted 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.150
 has many many options 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.980
 possibilities 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.439
 and it is very entertaining now we will pass 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.680
 through the streets and you'll see how good 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:38.329
 people to interact with the characters 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.329
 how well are we still 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.940
 good since we 're already saying 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.920
 that we have stuck a jump in the game 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.130
 as follows 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.650
 the streets are perfectly recreated 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.950
 the truth is that art happens 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.020
 without more for the egg is a pleasure and 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.900
 give a bit the adventures of the 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.550
 auditors a banking family like you 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.280
 I said before that you're in fights with the 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.020
 plan of the borgia medici and with 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.930
 the wars for power and against the 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:11.220
 dad you know what's left you can do so much 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.810
 walk as by the castles as I go out 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.080
 out in this case we are going to leave for 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:19.230
 show you a little this game has been 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.319
 I also know that I have not been very 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.650
 commented by 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:27.409
 called conspiracy theories by 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.709
 to mention a sect like that of the most 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:29.709
 A) Yes 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.410
 that has really existed and that have 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.900
 had a very very crappy role no if not 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.220
 let's see for example the ones as well as the 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.520
 horse that you can ride in a 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.520
 horse 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.490
 for example the assassin I believe what 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.370
 it's this guy who was called san albano 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.020
 that they also called alhaurín that 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.760
 what curious 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:57.340
 the similarity not alhaurín with worthy wing 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.019
 that was the inspirer and the creator of the 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.610
 accepts assassins or smokers 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.150
 of hashish 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.800
 another thing that is very ingrained here in 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:10.370
 the southern area of ​​Spain 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:14.010
 and inputs the Assassins 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:16.310
 he used a technique that nowadays 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:20.600
 charges a lot 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.650
 much controversy as would be the homicide 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.830
 yes politician sir 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.970
 this technique used by this sect 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.460
 it caused dread 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.580
 after its headquarters was in the fortress 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:35.790
 the lot there in Iran are a sect of 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:38.139
 they will go a warrior town 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.330
 and this 6th 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.280
 today this this fortress was also 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.840
 known as the Eagle's Nest all 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.870
 these data that using are real in 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.910
 the eagle's nest 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.440
 which is also called the bunker 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.540
 of hitler 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.610
 I do not know if I remember there 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.930
 to the fortress look what the game 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.729
 is beautiful 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.190
 to do it as you look from where you 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:01.860
 you can walk you have a great amplitude 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.539
 of land to walk 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.190
 Now I like more the horse made and what 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:08.650
 pillo understands 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:11.830
 He's pretty handsome 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:14.290
 and nothing with this little more take into account 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.249
 that these people used is like that with 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:19.369
 certain purposes 

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:20.790
 already in the twenty- first century the washing 

00:05:19.369 --> 00:05:23.250
 of the brain 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.970
 so you can imagine what kind 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.100
 of game 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:29.169
 we are talking looks appropriate that as 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.819
 He said with the times we run 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:34.150
 and the game has a freedom of 

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:37.180
 impressive movement note is a 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:39.050
 athlete and it does not make you eat more than you eat 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.289
 Gothic 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:44.449
 As you can see, I ended up lying there but 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:46.789
 I wear armor that I regulate and I am 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:50.070
 a wonderful guy and I take 2 artime to 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:52.620
 get up I'm fantastic 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:55.310
 and nothing with this base of my first 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:57.510
 introduction to 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.700
 to take away those feet 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:02.040
 I'm talking to you as the law is called 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.390
 my first introduction to the world of 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.150
 videogames gentlemen since less me 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.650
 he lost so much that we would like to see a 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.510
 I do not know if he has done it right or wrong 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:12.300
 but a game that I recommend 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:14.160
 mackenna for pretty fix the church the 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:17.070
 amplitude of the landscapes you can move 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.630
 has many things to do and the 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:22.320
 little horse comes behind how nice of 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:25.850
 catches you from the aluminum gentlemen here 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.850
 I see my confidence
