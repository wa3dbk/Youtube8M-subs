 3 books and therefore book series in 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.960
 particular i didn't give a series they play 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.270
 important role in my life can be so 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.559
 say bye I measure at the moment on 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.059
 international film market 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.430
 a huge number of 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.590
 new various i did not let leak and 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.210
 there is beyond this from no small 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.640
 number of episodes which is long in my 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.579
 wish list is today i 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.460
 I'll tell you about some of them on our list 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.559
 this is cassandra player and and into the city of bones 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.989
 a book that I want to read so far 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.370
 how i bought it and if i would just 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.030
 Malaysia to 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.100
 on the price tag written March 2013 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.409
 already almost two years ago I started 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.780
 reads this book well and and yet in 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.270
 narrowing and did not finish reading and promise this 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.430
 kind of in some way you imagine some 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.650
 cassandra playoffs that this year 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.070
 more precisely, I think even this summer I 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.630
 I definitely jumped into the outgoing train I 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.150
 I wondered everything and Cassandra Claire 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.540
 the following books on my book list 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.070
 desires this you Cinderella Marissa Mayer 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.590
 this book is skyward sort of 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.200
 adaptation is already well known 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.509
 the story is cinderella the red cap is 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.310
 and rapunzel and if they wish 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.990
 or something in general Spit some 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.119
 on the cover maybe i'm wrong maybe 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.520
 be a different hero anyway this 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.860
 modern adaptations are taken 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.060
 stories that we all 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.840
 but more weight appear on them 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.650
 kidburg so for example in this case 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.230
 16 year old zolla 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.480
 I think that our isolate anisole she 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.250
 known as the best mechanic of my beijing 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.590
 she is a cyborg and 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.600
 sounds very interesting i really want 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.800
 familiarize yourself with this series 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.479
 as I learned and actually her 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.040
 existence because it sounds all 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.140
 very interesting and 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.000
 In instagram I subscribed to some 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.709
 people like on foreign tigers so she 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.410
 just people who talk about 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.820
 books photos and write in the description 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.350
 what do they think let's books and 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.480
 a large number of positive reviews 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.870
 flashed my tape about this book and about 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.780
 series as a whole. my list is sarah 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.910
 jay masses and and glass one about this 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.400
 book constantly throughout the past 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.590
 years have been told overseas be uber 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.540
 and one of my all-time favorite tigers 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.880
 Kristina even made this book list 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.950
 my best books of the past year and I 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.540
 decided to read it as you can 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.540
 notice I'm already about prices 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.370
 and reading and repentance in wild delight I'm from 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.470
 I hope this book will continue 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.290
 stay the same dynamic and 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.420
 interesting and unusual for the whole genre in 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.760
 Overall it seems to me because I wondered 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.830
 rarely appears so 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.910
 elaborate worlds and even here 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:01.549
 At the beginning there is no map and as it shows 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.290
 practice if it has a map of it 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.880
 the book should be interesting one more 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.700
 a thing that I really want to read 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.680
 start reading corrected this rows ansi and 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.480
 The fifth wave is a book in my home 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.880
 for several years now I've gotten to it 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.799
 I can not but really hope that when 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.810
 anything can be made fresh in this year is not 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:20.239
 I will do this because the next one 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.370
 my throw off take the movie so enter 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:25.610
 that it will be necessary then to get acquainted with the book 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.810
 this is something post apocalyptic so 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.720
 I hope that this will be something very 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.780
 interesting here are guns there are teenagers with 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.240
 weapon sounds pretty dangerous 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.950
 In fact, some kind of wave that will roll 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.530
 and bring with them all sorts of 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.690
 permissions are about to be found as 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.480
 since the aforementioned fifth wave 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.040
 and it is not known what awaits people after this 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.990
 the fifth wave and in general is waiting 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.910
 anything will they survive that's actually 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.830
 I could draw such data from 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.750
 some brief descriptions and reviews about 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.640
 book online because i'm not very 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.280
 love before reading the book gave 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.319
 price per plot and in detail u not so 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.480
 that we are 5 wave removes the penultimate 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.050
 line in the list of book series which 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.900
 want to start 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.850
 today's latest video series 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.670
 who want to start this book rensom 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:12.280
 riggsa weed this house 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.690
 strange children and the city ​​is empty and escape from 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.100
 home of strange children 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.930
 the only thing that I do not really me 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.630
 like in this series that's what they are 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.730
 look different from the side 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.990
 so that they are calm except but not so 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.880
 or else as you probably already 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.350
 repeatedly heard from our 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.510
 Russian tigers and from 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.130
 foreign video bloggers this book 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.260
 Astana pro boy 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.290
 since childhood grandfather will tell you about 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:38.200
 all sorts of tangled ghost stories 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:40.090
 monsters and shared some hellish 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.750
 creepy photos because of which i am 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.640
 the first place 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.400
 I didn't want to start this book, but I 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.860
 I read to the house of strange children of the past 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.510
 spring in this book bought this month 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.880
 because I decided that I still want 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.770
 read this series until the end to 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.440
 the same for the house of strange children too 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:59.710
 venous leaves in relatively short time 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:02.229
 so what up read the second book 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.880
 is a continuation of 1 and they say that 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:06.520
 second book about not being any better 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.530
 even than 1 so I have high hopes 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.849
 the account of these books he is like me today 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.410
