00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
supposed plans and that's the basic gist

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.219 
supposed plans and that's the basic gist
of<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.710> stir<00:01:37.920> without<00:01:38.220> giving<00:01:38.490> too<00:01:38.640> much<00:01:38.880> away

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
of the stir without giving too much away

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.230 
of the stir without giving too much away
so<00:01:40.229> yeah<00:01:40.380> simplistic<00:01:41.009> storyline<00:01:41.610> but<00:01:41.880> that

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
so yeah simplistic storyline but that

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.210 
so yeah simplistic storyline but that
totally<00:01:42.509> doesn't<00:01:42.750> matter<00:01:43.200> because<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
totally doesn't matter because the

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.429 
totally doesn't matter because the
dialogue<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:46.490> what<00:01:47.490> makes<00:01:47.790> this<00:01:48.329> comic<00:01:49.049> so

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
dialogue is what makes this comic so

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.069 
dialogue is what makes this comic so
freaking<00:01:50.189> enjoyable<00:01:50.759> whenever<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.750> read<00:01:51.990> my

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
freaking enjoyable whenever I read my

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.020 
freaking enjoyable whenever I read my
comics<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.680> like<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.070> read<00:01:53.189> them<00:01:53.340> out<00:01:53.460> loud<00:01:53.520> and

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
comics I like to read them out loud and

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.240 
comics I like to read them out loud and
pretty<00:01:54.240> much<00:01:54.299> act<00:01:54.689> out<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.140> part<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.680> the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
pretty much act out the part and the

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.760 
pretty much act out the part and the
dialogue<00:01:56.850> in<00:01:57.180> this<00:01:57.420> comic<00:01:57.869> was<00:01:58.049> so<00:01:58.290> realistic

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
dialogue in this comic was so realistic

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.490 
dialogue in this comic was so realistic
that<00:01:59.219> if<00:01:59.520> anyone<00:01:59.820> is<00:01:59.969> listening

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
that if anyone is listening

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.800 
that if anyone is listening
to<00:02:00.590> me<00:02:00.740> they<00:02:01.160> probably<00:02:01.700> would<00:02:02.270> officially

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
to me they probably would officially

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.860 
to me they probably would officially
think<00:02:03.110> that<00:02:03.290> I<00:02:03.320> am<00:02:03.500> crazy<00:02:04.000> it<00:02:05.000> was<00:02:05.150> bumps<00:02:05.600> under

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870
