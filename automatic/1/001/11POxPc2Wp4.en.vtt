00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
where I saw it from we're all the shots

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.750

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
and so when you see them bending you see

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.160 
and so when you see them bending you see
their<00:00:56.520> wrists<00:00:56.820> doing<00:00:57.239> this<00:00:57.360> thing<00:00:57.660> right<00:00:57.930> here

coming from my fingers really it's not

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.620 
coming from my fingers really it's not
like<00:03:25.120> it's<00:03:25.780> not<00:03:25.810> like<00:03:25.900> I'm<00:03:26.110> just<00:03:26.200> going<00:03:27.630> it's

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
like it's not like I'm just going it's

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.650 
like it's not like I'm just going it's
not<00:03:28.989> it's<00:03:29.380> not<00:03:29.530> that<00:03:29.739> at<00:03:29.860> all<00:03:30.420> comes<00:03:31.420> from<00:03:31.480> your
