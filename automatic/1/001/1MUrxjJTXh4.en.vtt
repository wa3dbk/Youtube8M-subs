00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.050
 six remaining in ps sense has to 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.710
 be firm nature to exploit its 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:41.410
 attack skill or skill of hidden 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.680
 impulse to increase the speed in 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.510
 each turn and objects life sphere there 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.239
 people who put you chosen ribbon but I 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.579
 I prefer to put lives but since in 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:55.059
 movements we will put protection for 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:57.850
 win a cascade impulse turn to 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:00.309
 take off by this one and apart makes power 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.100
 push back the rival and cascade it 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.620
 learn for what protection he learns 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.370
 by mt earthquake earthquake 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:12.850
 they learn by mt and then to shred 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:15.340
 quiet here I leave it to you I will 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.500
 I would put it to shred sincerely though 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.390
 it is very good to attack with 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.460
 priority I know we have a lot 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.050
 speed but nowadays in this metal 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.540
 at present grime there are many attacks with 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.940
 priority so quiet would not come 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.730
 nothing wrong the truth but good to crush it 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.760
 learn at level 22 or quiet what 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:36.910
 learn at level 34 so you can 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.700
 choose between one or the other and statistics 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:46.300
 end of match when it reaches the 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:48.340
 level 100 ps 282 attack 372 more life 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:53.680
 sphere or ojito with the attack that 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:58.080
 has defense 116 special attack 203 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:00.700
 special defense also 116 and speed 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.950
 289 that nothing happens because with a 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.860
 protection we are already quite elevated 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.170
 of speed so good I hope that you 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.460
 you have already tasted the meaning and how 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.700
 you can see it is not a pokémon with many 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.370
 defenses for that but good 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.590

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.940
