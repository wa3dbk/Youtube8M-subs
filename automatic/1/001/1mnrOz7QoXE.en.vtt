00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:08.099
 aaaah staff on youtube is existing 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.980
 here with you and bringing another video 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.250
 for the car channel and in that video are 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.960
 are you how to do ultimate as or 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.490
 ohs ufms 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.410
 for those who do not know what the ultimate is 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.689
 how is it when you have the mode 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.260
 good in golden and to and uses his 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.420
 ultimatum and operates to make 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.679
 I just always pulled you squeeze 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:34.110
 five and a half times later you 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.649
 direction of the zoo in the 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.420
 of your opponent and press once to go 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:51.059
 do it here with you and then put it on 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:53.670
 slow-motion 12345 slow because 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.059
 you go in that direction if you have to 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.289
 press yy and fast faster than 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.690
 can tighten 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.829
 before arriving at an instance 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.609
 unfavorable, which is a little bit 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.609
 complicated 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.920
 thousand 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:20.000
 you can make one of these options 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.550
 You can read the newspaper or go forward. 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.369
 of the opponent in front of the opponent is 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.380
 much more complicated is the profile making the 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.350
 diagonal that the times that went up 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.850
 so the belt can not use your 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.170
 ultimate 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.170
 I'll do it again for you. 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:46.810
 diagonally this time and now the team 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.810
 another caught who much more easily 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.630
 well this is the ultimate as what I 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.090
 I passed to you, I'm going to put it on camera. 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.509
 slow and for you with the buttons I 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.660
 I used it for you to see clearly how it is 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.110
 Do not forget that it's just a 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.239
 turn 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:13.780
 ah but you have to think fast that this 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.780
 here you already know 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.180
 the jury 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.630
 I'll show you the classic I liked 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:53.150
 enough and it's in this time that you go 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:58.550
 Hit the ball Try to hit it 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:01.550
 well again and use a team that you 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:04.730
 try to do with two more characters 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:08.090
 It's like but I 'd rather do it with the 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:11.060
 penta but law only gets clear if the 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.950
 opponents had shut down the flu and 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.470
 with the old continent with dolls that 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.400
 do not carry a signet as they compare 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.040
 full 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.410
 It cost everything in flames and quinton for 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.750
 You guys, do not forget to leave it here. 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.620
 no comment on any musician 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.530
 spirit 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.440
 Thanks and make it a favorite of the time that 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.660
 It helps a lot to spread the channel 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.150
 I bring 20 more for you because 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.050
 without use and does not inspire much to bring 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:41.380
 the videos 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:41.380
 Thanks everybody I went six fuck
