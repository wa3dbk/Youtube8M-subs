couple of the mortals is pretty much to
you<00:02:17.300> they<00:02:17.510> are<00:02:17.540> so<00:02:17.810> good<00:02:17.840> against<00:02:18.290> others<00:02:18.590> so

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
you they are so good against others so

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.380 
you they are so good against others so
yeah<00:02:19.190> that's<00:02:19.310> always<00:02:19.519> a<00:02:19.610> scenario<00:02:20.060> you<00:02:20.209> look

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
yeah that's always a scenario you look

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.610 
yeah that's always a scenario you look
for<00:02:20.600> usually<00:02:21.050> you<00:02:21.140> don't<00:02:21.230> get<00:02:21.410> it<00:02:21.530> because

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
for usually you don't get it because

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.770 
for usually you don't get it because
blink<00:02:21.920> stalkers<00:02:22.070> feel<00:02:22.250> like<00:02:22.760> I<00:02:23.030> try<00:02:23.480> to<00:02:23.510> do<00:02:23.690> it

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
blink stalkers feel like I try to do it

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.170 
blink stalkers feel like I try to do it
once<00:02:24.140> anyway<00:02:25.010> forward<00:02:25.280> til<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:25.640> investors<00:02:26.030> in

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
once anyway forward til the investors in

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.270 
once anyway forward til the investors in
it<00:02:26.269> failed<00:02:26.480> but<00:02:26.989> then<00:02:27.110> I<00:02:27.140> tried<00:02:27.380> again<00:02:27.650> yessum

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
it failed but then I tried again yessum

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.220 
it failed but then I tried again yessum
so<00:02:29.030> it's<00:02:29.180> a<00:02:29.239> scenario<00:02:29.450> always<00:02:29.870> look<00:02:29.989> for<00:02:30.140> you

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
so it's a scenario always look for you

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.229 
so it's a scenario always look for you
usually<00:02:30.350> don't<00:02:30.709> get<00:02:30.860> to<00:02:30.980> do<00:02:31.100> it<00:02:31.190> so<00:02:31.489> kind<00:02:32.150> of

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
usually don't get to do it so kind of

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.900 
usually don't get to do it so kind of

mentioned<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:37.700> game<00:02:37.850> so<00:02:37.970> throughout<00:02:38.150> were

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
mentioned the game so throughout were

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.790 
mentioned the game so throughout were
pretty<00:02:38.510> quick<00:02:38.780> was<00:02:39.050> there<00:02:39.200> anything<00:02:39.470> about

pretty quick was there anything about

pretty quick was there anything about
the<00:02:40.010> games<00:02:40.190> was<00:02:40.370> select<00:02:40.700> that<00:02:41.600> was<00:02:41.780> noteworthy

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
the games was select that was noteworthy

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.370 
the games was select that was noteworthy
or<00:02:43.360> something<00:02:44.360> that<00:02:44.480> stuck<00:02:44.600> out<00:02:44.720> to<00:02:44.780> you<00:02:44.959> both

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
or something that stuck out to you both

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.380

games<00:02:45.680> they<00:02:46.250> were<00:02:46.310> both<00:02:46.370> long<00:02:46.760> games<00:02:47.000> but<00:02:47.269> he

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
games they were both long games but he

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.759 
games they were both long games but he
did<00:02:47.510> kind<00:02:47.750> of<00:02:47.810> aggressive<00:02:48.050> bills<00:02:48.410> early<00:02:48.650> on<00:02:48.739> I

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
did kind of aggressive bills early on I

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.650 
did kind of aggressive bills early on I
got<00:02:48.980> a<00:02:49.010> significant<00:02:49.640> advantage<00:02:49.910> I<00:02:50.090> just<00:02:50.269> took

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
got a significant advantage I just took

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.449
