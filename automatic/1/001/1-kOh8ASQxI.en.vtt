00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
just didn't and we they're a different

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:36.719 
just didn't and we they're a different
type<00:00:35.600> of<00:00:35.629> defense<00:00:36.080> they<00:00:36.320> were<00:00:36.350> they<00:00:36.650> were

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:36.729 
type of defense they were they were

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:40.030 
type of defense they were they were
their<00:00:37.729> inside<00:00:38.150> guys<00:00:38.449> two<00:00:39.320> gaps<00:00:39.559> a<00:00:39.739> lot<00:00:39.890> of

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
their inside guys two gaps a lot of

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.350 
their inside guys two gaps a lot of
stuff<00:00:40.280> that's<00:00:40.729> what<00:00:40.940> I<00:00:41.000> mean<00:00:41.180> by<00:00:41.330> not

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
stuff that's what I mean by not

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.070 
stuff that's what I mean by not
finishing<00:00:41.930> blocks<00:00:43.059> you<00:00:44.059> know<00:00:44.150> if<00:00:44.690> they're<00:00:44.900> to

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:45.080 
finishing blocks you know if they're to

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.930 
finishing blocks you know if they're to
gap<00:00:45.320> and<00:00:45.559> not<00:00:45.680> rushing<00:00:45.979> but<00:00:46.309> we<00:00:46.610> just<00:00:46.729> got<00:00:46.909> to

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
gap and not rushing but we just got to

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.549 
gap and not rushing but we just got to
sustain<00:00:47.360> blocks<00:00:47.629> and<00:00:47.839> finish<00:00:48.080> blocks<00:00:48.350> and<00:00:48.530> I

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
sustain blocks and finish blocks and I

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:49.660 
sustain blocks and finish blocks and I
don't<00:00:48.650> think<00:00:48.769> our<00:00:49.010> running<00:00:49.280> backs<00:00:49.430> did<00:00:49.610> a

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
don't think our running backs did a

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.759 
don't think our running backs did a
great<00:00:49.850> job<00:00:49.879> of<00:00:50.360> of<00:00:50.809> hitting<00:00:51.199> the<00:00:51.260> hole<00:00:51.409> harder

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:51.769 
great job of of hitting the hole harder

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:53.859 
great job of of hitting the hole harder
near<00:00:51.979> that<00:00:52.100> so<00:00:52.400> I<00:00:52.640> would<00:00:53.420> just<00:00:53.449> didn't<00:00:53.750> play

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:53.869 
near that so I would just didn't play

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:55.240 
near that so I would just didn't play
