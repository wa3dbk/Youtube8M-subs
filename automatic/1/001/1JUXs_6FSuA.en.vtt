00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:12.420
 hi every minute new video of the 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.340
 channel after project this is the first one 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.529
 September first video from later 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.029
 summer and I decided to go back to 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.980
 talk about the news of the world of 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.660
 robotics so let's see what happened 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.680
 in this time when I'm not there 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.119
 been the videos and we start getting the 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.580
 right light one of the most difficult things 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.529
 to be managed in photography above all 61 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.260
 spend pending to handle everything from 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.480
 only the work becomes really heavy 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.380
 how to solve all this but with the 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.380
 drones of course 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.860
 let's talk about morgex now 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.390
 after exact it is very famous for his 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.500
 versatility and for its ability to 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.050
 movement 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.580
 recently it has been updated and over 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.769
 lighting improvements with 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.660
 new ned now dirty morpher 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.390
 overcome obstacles can manage 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.790
 different terrains with different inclinations 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.280
 and also improved the movements of the 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.800
 sper mood for the way it uses 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.800
 to the limbs but I said it moves rolling 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.160
 this is definitely a robot of which 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.230
 we will hear a lot about next year 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.450
 it's called gibo and its slogan is the 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.130
 first robot for the family live 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.440
 pepper competition I told you about 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.330
 from a last food video can be already 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.830
 preordered but will arrive on the market at 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.210
 end of next year 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.250
 You can buy the basic version 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.800
 or the developer version with the 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.880
 cappelletti seats grateful to facilitate the 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.250
 life that wants to improve 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.890
 functionality of the robot itself what it knows 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.960
 go around for now see he hears speak 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.330
 interacts with us can remember us 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.770
 appointments make photo calls manage 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.260
 totally our gene from ours 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.270
 many contacts have already been tried 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.450
 We just ca n't wait to see them 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.450
 at work 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:52.680
 food testimony parma technology click to 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:05.940
 buy or not to write 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.590
 let's see a very interesting video now 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.180
 directly from harvard 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.640
 the video shows a search made 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.099
 are swarms of auto robot anti program 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.080
 the research is inspired by animal groups 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:40.000
 who in the world work together create 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.130
 very complex structures 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.590
 using 2,000 kg bots that are 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.080
 small robots at low cost and possible 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.819
 that star there to work with the 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.790
 kg bots communicate with each other 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:53.230
 through infrared and and it was 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.849
 developed an algorithm that 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.230
 allows the robot to take the form 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:59.170
 desired by the user 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.970
 without human intervention at the beginning yes 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.799
 put four robots to indicate 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.720
 the beginning of the form and slowly from 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.970
 only the robots from the outer edge 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.660
 they begin to move and to create the form 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.000
 desired 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.220
 the robot keep moving until 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.599
 they didn't get out of shape or until they did 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.860
 meet another robot 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.860
 the result is truly impressive 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.290
 could not miss a video on the iss 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.270
 bucket challenge that followed social 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.520
 network and knows that this series of videos 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.750
 where famous people do not pull 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.000
 of frozen water on for 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.690
 charity has literally depopulated 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.730
 on the network 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.020
 this fashion was also followed by 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.680
 bar company also so 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.570
 original 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.110
 use buffet to drop 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.110
 ice water 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:18.070
 this kitchen is due to 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:06:04.650
 yet another proof of mtv in the world of 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.690
 videogames are taking more and more 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.729
 foot virtual reality devices 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.800
 as a swift niche in this video 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:13.080
 let's see how the baxter robot comes 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.610
 guided through opus and like his 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.710
 arms are moved through the 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.720
 other idra device for the 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:21.229
 virtual reality, however, that only concerns 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.229
 arms 

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:17.069
 well for today it's all I hope you watch video 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.979
 both liked let me know that you do not 

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:22.199
 like as a comment below 

00:07:18.979 --> 00:07:24.900
 I hope you could come back to do tutorials 

00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:28.430
 and other types of videos I greet you for now 

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.430
 and we'll see you next time 

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:37.150
 well they give me quorum 

00:07:44.259 --> 00:07:48.610
 on from shock are included
