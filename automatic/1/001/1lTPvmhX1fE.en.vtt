00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
really not sure how long I'm gonna keep

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.949 
really not sure how long I'm gonna keep
these<00:02:49.849> thick<00:02:50.849> strings<00:02:51.180> on<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.450> opposite<00:02:51.780> so

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
these thick strings on the opposite so

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:57.059 
these thick strings on the opposite so
very<00:02:52.890> strange<00:02:53.280> to<00:02:53.580> me

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.339 

but<00:02:58.069> the<00:02:58.159> guitar<00:02:58.540> does<00:02:59.540> have<00:02:59.720> a<00:02:59.750> clean<00:03:00.049> sound

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
but the guitar does have a clean sound

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.940 
but the guitar does have a clean sound
very<00:03:00.709> clean<00:03:01.040> I<00:03:02.290> guess<00:03:03.290> it's<00:03:03.440> supposed<00:03:03.560> to

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
very clean I guess it's supposed to

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.309 
very clean I guess it's supposed to
considering<00:03:04.720> it's<00:03:05.720> a<00:03:05.840> Martin<00:03:06.260> and<00:03:06.500> they're

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
considering it's a Martin and they're

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:13.690 
considering it's a Martin and they're
