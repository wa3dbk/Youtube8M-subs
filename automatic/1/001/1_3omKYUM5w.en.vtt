00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:18.039
 from my friend from Miami, you do not have anything 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:18.039
 more believe your death stay still 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.460
 demon of the mud 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.460
 or not 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:33.240
 like the battle of the five armies 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.240
 I should have finished 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:47.640
 they need some assistance not everything 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:51.230
 It will be very good because everything is going to 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.230
 be in the next movie 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:03.860
 I hear you I just wanted to tell you that I killed 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.570
 the dragon that dragon that dragon the 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.700
 dragon that you could not control and what 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.580
 you left that dragon loose in rec town 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.049
 I killed him what is your point so 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.540
 technically it makes me more powerful 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.369
 michetti no I do not see it that way and 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.440
 now you are greatly exceeded and we 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.350
 you owe a lot of money so pay the 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:25.030
 I'll see your threats not convince me 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.570
 your word is worth nothing 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.640
 fear beds slip uncomfortably 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.490
 slip uncomfortable if he is not going to 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.009
 get out very well we will attack immediately 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.400
 you do not immediately want to wait until 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:41.979
 it's clear that they are not like 12 of 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.030
 them and 10,000 of us these 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.030
 they finish before it gets dark 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:52.600
 good and what with this 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.600
 why my brother in law 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.810
 I will not be 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.510
 5 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.500
 I was thinking if the gold is cursed 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.320
 do you think the rest of us for 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.240
 catching the disease the dragon 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:22.760
 I had not thought about me blond that is 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:29.360
 happening what's happening to me too 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:32.360
 get away from me gold is my gold then you 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.360

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.599
 this 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:58.390
 while no sword can penetrate 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.210
 it's a gift you know why not 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.950
 you better give it to me after the battle 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.960
 probably the list is more than me 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.160
 starting a war and everything 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.220
 it's probably probably not a bad 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.220
 idea 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.520
