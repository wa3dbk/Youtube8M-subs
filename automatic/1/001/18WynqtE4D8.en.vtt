00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:52.740 

see<00:04:32.740> that<00:04:32.950> I<00:04:50.910> keep<00:04:51.910> in<00:04:52.060> mind<00:04:52.240> i'm<00:04:52.390> using<00:04:52.660> a

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
see that I keep in mind i'm using a

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.780

really<00:04:52.900> big<00:04:53.200> ass<00:04:53.380> brush<00:04:53.770> so<00:04:54.130> we<00:04:54.640> have<00:04:54.760> a

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
really big ass brush so we have a

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.420 
really big ass brush so we have a
smaller<00:04:55.210> brush<00:04:55.450> it'll<00:04:55.930> be<00:04:56.020> easier<00:04:56.440> on<00:04:56.590> them<00:04:56.800> on

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
smaller brush it'll be easier on them on

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:30.860 
smaller brush it'll be easier on them on
