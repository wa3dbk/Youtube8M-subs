00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.840
 more 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:15.629
 an old almost smoothly through otherwise their skin has a special one 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:18.629
 surface structure 

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:25.609
 the Inuit have a singing hour of it future body shapes 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:29.630
 the 4th 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.010
 All are because their elegant mobility almost unbeatable 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.760
 the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.860
 The manufacturers of swimming goggles have protected these patents of nature 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.400
 transferred to the human body 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.180
 the result of high-tech swimming suits 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.350
 He plays a lot of effort produced in the controversial in the future, possibly quite 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.470
 forbidden 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.640
 What this second skin really does bring to the striker 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.640
 Sports scientist in Leipzig schied examined 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.870
 the results the high-tech suits make less turbulence 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.130
 Less fuel is produced and the swimming movements are exactly on 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.260
 many athletes feel in a new suit 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.660
 like a fish in the water 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.680
 when you enter the harbors under water 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.680
 percent makes 111 5 points there 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.320
 and already give the feeling that children are up 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.770
 if a swimmer has only a leisurely one 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.200
 then there are significantly more eddies 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.970
 especially at the edges of the body shape 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.500
 and what's left 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.690
 The swimmer has to be much stronger against the same strong current 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.140
 fight 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.940
 Swimsuits at the same speed and in the middle of 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.130
 Civil War Wenzel 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.539
 So that means the sport celebrities as migrants to stimulate the 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:01.280
 same speed 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.200
 and you can do that 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.020
 do not fulfill in any way 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.370
 still wise 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.780
 One reason why the suit is faster is because of it 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.780
 surface 

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:18.059
 therefore, the water rolls off easily 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.319
 Streamlined surfaces have researchers on the skin of sharks 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.749
 discovered 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:30.079
 they have developed a material that resembles a fine film structure to 6 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.079
 the one of a price 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.479
 the result 

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:41.309
 their headquarters are much less resistant to the current 

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:44.309
 as smooth surfaces 

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:48.989
 some swimsuits use such rules structures 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.989
 times closer to less group 

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:01.749
 the optimization of the body shape and the water-repellent surface 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.209
 for those on the train it's faster the two recipes around the float faster 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.209
 to make promptly gets to allow second 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:17.129
 the increase in performance surprised even scientists 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:23.999
 that's interesting that that's Saab's influence on that scale 

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:25.379
 I personally 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:30.049
 Out as Australia she was not just expecting because of the injuries 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:30.529
 would have 

00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:33.529
 did 

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:37.959
 the air is also the best swimmer Jobs does not make a world champion alone 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.959
 Kraft's endurance and technology are still indispensable 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.260
 has the nose in front 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.519
 Who with his body imitate the movements of a dolphin particularly well 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.319
 can 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.659
 There will also be in the future 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:04.769
 with Rite Aid swimsuit 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.349
 or in a classic outfit
