water and we weren't getting the images
that<00:03:21.440> we<00:03:21.560> wanted<00:03:21.920> we<00:03:22.579> knew<00:03:22.819> right<00:03:23.060> away<00:03:23.090> that

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
that we wanted we knew right away that

that we wanted we knew right away that
we<00:03:23.569> were<00:03:23.720> going<00:03:23.870> to<00:03:23.959> have<00:03:24.079> to<00:03:24.110> go<00:03:24.379> somewhere

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
we were going to have to go somewhere

00:03:24.739 --> 00:04:27.719 
we were going to have to go somewhere
else<00:03:24.799> and<00:03:25.159> try<00:03:25.400> again

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:29.950

the helmet cam he was hoping for a
source<00:04:46.460> that<00:04:46.520> we<00:04:46.729> had<00:04:46.910> to<00:04:47.090> get<00:04:47.240> this<00:04:47.419> guy<00:04:47.630> this

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
source that we had to get this guy this

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.050 
source that we had to get this guy this
was<00:04:47.990> a<00:04:48.020> once-in-a-lifetime<00:04:48.530> fish<00:04:49.160> but<00:04:49.910> we

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
was a once-in-a-lifetime fish but we

00:04:50.060 --> 00:05:01.810 
was a once-in-a-lifetime fish but we
were<00:04:50.150> too<00:04:50.330> late<00:04:59.680> the<00:05:00.680> next<00:05:00.830> day<00:05:01.009> we<00:05:01.280> decided<00:05:01.460> to

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
were too late the next day we decided to

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.999 
were too late the next day we decided to
try<00:05:01.970> filming<00:05:02.330> in<00:05:02.570> a<00:05:02.630> smaller<00:05:02.990> system<00:05:03.560> where<00:05:03.979> we

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:04.009 
try filming in a smaller system where we

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:05.710 
try filming in a smaller system where we
hope<00:05:04.250> the<00:05:04.430> water<00:05:04.639> would<00:05:04.849> be<00:05:04.970> clean<00:05:05.240> despite

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
hope the water would be clean despite

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.719 
hope the water would be clean despite
the<00:05:05.900> heavy<00:05:06.050> rains<00:05:06.410> we've<00:05:06.680> had<00:05:06.889> we<00:05:07.580> were

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:07.729 
the heavy rains we've had we were

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:09.670 
the heavy rains we've had we were
ecstatic<00:05:08.180> when<00:05:08.539> we<00:05:08.690> arrived<00:05:09.020> and<00:05:09.229> we<00:05:09.320> saw<00:05:09.500> we

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
ecstatic when we arrived and we saw we

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.170 
ecstatic when we arrived and we saw we
could<00:05:09.830> see<00:05:10.039> straight<00:05:10.099> to<00:05:10.610> the<00:05:10.699> bottom<00:05:11.000> of<00:05:11.060> the

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
could see straight to the bottom of the

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.300 
could see straight to the bottom of the
creek<00:05:11.389> there<00:05:11.900> were<00:05:12.020> large<00:05:12.320> schools<00:05:12.740> of<00:05:13.009> chum

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
creek there were large schools of chum

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.999 
creek there were large schools of chum
and<00:05:13.520> pink<00:05:14.300> salmon<00:05:14.570> spawning<00:05:15.020> this<00:05:15.680> was<00:05:15.889> going

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:16.009 
and pink salmon spawning this was going

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:17.560 
and pink salmon spawning this was going
to<00:05:16.070> be<00:05:16.160> the<00:05:16.340> perfect<00:05:16.669> location<00:05:16.940> to<00:05:17.330> try

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
to be the perfect location to try

00:05:17.570 --> 00:06:50.540 
to be the perfect location to try
underwater<00:05:18.020> filming

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:50.550 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.610 

and<00:06:51.550> so<00:06:51.880> our<00:06:52.180> search<00:06:52.600> for<00:06:52.870> the<00:06:52.990> salmon<00:06:53.260> world

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:53.620 
and so our search for the salmon world

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.000 
and so our search for the salmon world
comes<00:06:54.040> to<00:06:54.280> him<00:06:54.490> with<00:06:54.820> this<00:06:55.000> female<00:06:56.010> having

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.010 
comes to him with this female having

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:59.640 
comes to him with this female having
avoided<00:06:57.280> killer<00:06:57.700> whales<00:06:58.030> seals<00:06:58.870> sea<00:06:59.620> lions

00:06:59.640 --> 00:06:59.650 
avoided killer whales seals sea lions

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:02.550 
avoided killer whales seals sea lions
and<00:07:00.340> the<00:07:00.670> fisherman's<00:07:01.210> net<00:07:01.450> she<00:07:02.380> has

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:02.560 
and the fisherman's net she has

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.790 
and the fisherman's net she has
completed<00:07:03.010> the<00:07:03.250> circle<00:07:03.670> of<00:07:03.820> life<00:07:04.500> her<00:07:05.500> body

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:05.800 
completed the circle of life her body

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.920 
completed the circle of life her body
now<00:07:06.070> returns<00:07:06.580> its<00:07:06.760> nutrients<00:07:07.360> to<00:07:07.540> the<00:07:07.660> stream

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:07.930 
now returns its nutrients to the stream

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:10.800 
now returns its nutrients to the stream
where<00:07:08.140> she<00:07:08.380> was<00:07:08.530> born<00:07:08.800> for<00:07:09.730> years<00:07:10.120> and<00:07:10.480> over
