 for girls as they are today I am going to 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.930
 talk about the three types of skin that 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.000
 we can have I do not know if you already know what 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.769
 skin type you have but good today you 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.269
 I will say more or less with the sound 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.250
 so that you realize what kind of 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.780
 Danish products to the second type of 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.100
 skin to start 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.320
 I want to tell you that there are three types 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.840
 from pierre nothing else they saw normal well 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.029
 dry and oily skin dry skin is super 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.590
 easy to recognize them and feel them tight 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.930
 for example after washing you 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.539
 you feel that they are pulling your skin is 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.149
 dry apart in these areas do not leave the 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.270
 pores of mine is alert that you can have 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.730
 If your skin is dry it is usually 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.680
 a type of skin wrinkles faster than 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.860
 the others the other skin types that you 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.770
 the face or our body does not produce 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.350
 that fat natural so what are you going to 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.260
 need is a moisturizing grandmother and 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.360
 moisturizer so you can take care of your 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.610
 face and we continue with oily skin to 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.190
 the skin grace is the opposite the 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.100
 dry skin our body produces a lot 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.600
 sebum then normally in the area 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.900
 will be bright is a skin that 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.670
 always going to have like that shine but 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.650
 too much goes to them they need 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.810
 use only moisturizer but do not increase t 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.119
 because already blow produces a lot 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.860
 Wetting does not need it too 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.810
 they look like skins, so do not use 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.930
 protective astringents that help 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:29.130
 lower that shine there was tonic that you 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.930
 they help that web shine 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.289
 but good that you have the amount of skin 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.929
 is that wrinkles are also presented 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:40.080
 long after a dry skin on the 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:42.119
 amount of sebum and fat that does not have 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.399
 Well, the natural graphics do not go to 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.950
 frighten the pores on the skin 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:51.060
 also another way to see is that they look 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.970
 upside down from the dry they look very very very 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.640
 big so for this type of skin 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.860
 who do not usually use only moisturizers and do not 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.470
 for example humectants and since your 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.750
 body no longer contributes in its measurement is 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.150
 more excessive that it is always 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.190
 sparkly 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.810
 that normal pieces like skin 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:15.590
 to affect since this skin 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:18.410
 looks healthy looks radiant because it does not 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.620
 it produces neither many we have nor is it is 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.380
 very very tight the pores are super 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.690
 visible and they are closed and it does not look like 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.300
 in the stone they are super dilated 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:33.019
 open however can can happen 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:36.590
 that normal skin certain douglas like 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:38.780
 a little dot of grease or shine in the 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.640
 process zone is because once 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.200
 learned these three types of skin 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.480
 they have to know that there's also 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.030
 skin conditions that are our 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.819
 food according to our our 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.110
 internal metabolism that we have and are 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.239
 when the first one is a skin 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.700
 dehydrated this usually happens because it 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.459
 loses very quickly the water that 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.709
 it contains our body apart also 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.769
 it's a skin that out there by changes 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.480
 hormones are always dehydrated or 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.700
 It can also be a bad diet 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.500
 or it can be for many reasons 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.960
 also by climatic factors 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.300
 first winter not why 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.790
 that you usually see dehydrated skin 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.470
 this skin if you have a skin 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.540
 dehydrated you will find out why 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.370
 Normally your skin will always be 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.820
 as off 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.760
 the soft skin as sensitive and you 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:30.040
 skin is like fly are use products that 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.760
 help moisturize and apart from products 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.980
 drink a lot of water and eat well 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.990
 to help your skin look very cute 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.420
 then there is sensitive skin that kind of 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:44.410
 skin is not very thin skin is that 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:47.980
 really presents in people like 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:50.590
 rosarito and watch movies like 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.630
 nose or in this part of here you can see the 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.520
 blessed that you are your skin is sensitive 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.600
 be careful because this type of skin 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:01.060
 sometimes the products fall badly and 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:04.300
 they have allergic reactions and in this 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:09.040
 type of skin affects them a lot in the 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:11.860
 exposure to the sun to the cold for example to 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.810
 high temperatures to the air 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.600
 all this has to take into account 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.940
 if your skin is sensitive normally as 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.870
 I tell them what they will notice if in our 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.519
 zone and in the nose 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.530
 there are going to be doctors and we deal with the 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:27.130
 leg and this type of skin is here 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:29.260
 presents the brightness in the technical zone 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.960
 that this stone we owe most of 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.760
 the yogurt centers is ready since in 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.120
 the area that always appears to me 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.580
 shines what is the ren of the nose and 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.110
 the doctor then sometimes we confuse 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.600
 because we think we are oily skin 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.460
 but it's not like that because for example it has 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.770
 this area here our skin can be 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.720
 compadre dry so they have to have 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.280
 Be careful with that is what sometimes I 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.260
 he says do not ask me thank you because always 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.810
 you shore between the subject area and over there 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.240
 the arms but rather clicks back 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.490
 there are usually products that most 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.820
 of sleeve is said for normal skin to the 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.560
 mixed that out there is the type pass of 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.870
 product that you are going to have to use 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.000
 we can be the skin to make to eye with 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.940
 this putting your oily skin has 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.590
 sense that environmentally presents 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.590
 many granites impurities 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:24.759
 and in america 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.490
 this is due to hormonal changes because 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:29.380
 comes the menstrual period or can 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.320
 impose a climate that we get those 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:35.380
 impurities or oily skin if in your case 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:38.110
 is a stones can be and the normal 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:40.870
 there is medication that does not present as much 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:43.120
 Shine is how the skin looks really good 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.759
 skin looks very cute but if 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.919
 presents in by those in the area of ​​the 

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:51.160
 nose the little black spots and pimples 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:53.560
 So that's because of something hormonal that 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.990
 sometimes we have in our body so 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:59.210
 well keep in mind and are what kind of 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:01.970
 skin comes if the projects you use 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:04.370
 for that skin type so more or 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.680
 less a day in your house stay do not be 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.330
 one more Saturday on the election of what 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.419
 kind of skin that you can use 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:13.910
 products that corresponds to that kind of 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:16.099
 skin if your skin is dry and you think it is 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.900
 evil cow fat you use products 

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:20.180
 to lose weight because normally 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.310
 truly travel only products is to bring 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.800
 less orientation and hydration so 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:26.419
 keep in mind that I hope that I have 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.860
 liked this video if you have any questions 

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:30.770
 what happened to me 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:33.320
 leave me the gypsy's box but in 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.880
 the comments to more or less see what 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.680
 skin type has is that the truth that 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:40.490
 he could not have or explain but 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:43.160
 these are the guidelines we should know 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.660
 to take into account that type of skin 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.030
 I also recommend eating very well 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:49.310
 because it's a big influence on our 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:52.370
 kind of good to eat a lot of fruit a lot 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:53.690
 vegetable and not so much fat so good 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.639
 do not 

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:57.860
 do not forget to tell me in ideal origin 

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:59.240
 also like the video and future 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.770
 surely video to is also 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.569
 subscribe to your clients so that 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:05.360
 receive all the updates that 

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:08.690
 I remember that I upload companies or the

 week not following Wednesdays all 

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:13.900
 will not feel the changes in fact not 

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:17.350
 they make so much foam for me 

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:20.410
 in other products I also believe in 

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:22.800
 these two conditioners of line 2 

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:22.800
 what is
