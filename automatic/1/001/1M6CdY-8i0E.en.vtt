00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.309
 hello now we are here at gosee bike 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.570
 systems at the trade fair stand 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.340
 the neon the new on- board computer from bosch 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.270
 we'll get closer to you soon 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.980
 imagine 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.830
 Let's go to the others 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.170
 stations through performance line 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.670
 We show you shifting and active life 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.210
 just briefly here what to see 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.070
 and on the whole details we go 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.600
 later in an article 1 resp 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.650
 will be a lot to the past as well 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.470
 written about it 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.030
 such a big topic since 2005 10 to in 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.920
 the integrated circuits too 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:50.020
 called shifting here we have 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:54.970
 automatic circuits of shimano and 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:58.660
 there vinci the quasi about the on- board computer 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:02.070
 innovia can be controlled and 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:05.920
 thereby automate the switching process 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.270
 the new Bosch computer with bosch 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:14.910
 to see a lot of new features here 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:17.260
 we have essentially the 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.869
 line function where we like data 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.570
 speed supplied power 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.280
 self-kicked power battery 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.729
 reach average speed 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.479
 et cetera get displayed and then 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.240
 it continues with the 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:34.410
 navigation function yes, you have yourself 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:38.520
 together with the stop map service 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.520
 built a navigation 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.760
 In addition, there is a fitness 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.800
 Function where you have your own training 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:50.280
 level can control and expand 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:53.230
 the whole together with the 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.580
 online platform connect the way as well 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:59.050
 on smartphone with corresponding app 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:03.210
 Details also in the corresponding 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.210
