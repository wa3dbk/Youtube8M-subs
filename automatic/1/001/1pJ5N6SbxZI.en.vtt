orangey yeah a lot more orange II who

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:43.509 
orangey yeah a lot more orange II who
makes<00:02:35.760> Fanta<00:02:36.360> does<00:02:36.990> that<00:02:37.110> Coke<00:02:37.380> prove<00:02:38.340> so

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.729 

dirty<00:02:44.519> drain<00:02:44.850> water<00:02:45.060> yeah<00:02:45.510> can't<00:02:45.959> wait<00:02:46.080> oh

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.390 

that's<00:02:49.739> really<00:02:50.100> really<00:02:50.880> really<00:02:51.239> orange<00:02:51.390> E<00:02:52.400> it

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
that's really really really orange E it

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.370 
that's really really really orange E it
might<00:02:53.580> just<00:02:53.910> be<00:02:53.970> orange<00:02:54.390> soda<00:02:54.959> though<00:02:55.080> yeah

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
might just be orange soda though yeah

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.040 
might just be orange soda though yeah
there's<00:02:55.769> a<00:02:55.830> tiny<00:02:56.250> bit<00:02:56.489> of<00:02:56.610> coke<00:02:56.880> in<00:02:57.239> there

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
there's a tiny bit of coke in there

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.509 
there's a tiny bit of coke in there
hence<00:02:58.230> I<00:02:58.380> think<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.650> colour<00:02:58.860> difference<00:02:59.100> is

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
hence I think the colour difference is

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.880 
hence I think the colour difference is
this<00:03:00.269> one<00:03:00.510> probably<00:03:00.750> does<00:03:01.140> have<00:03:01.170> more<00:03:01.650> of<00:03:01.739> the

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
this one probably does have more of the

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.009 
this one probably does have more of the
orange<00:03:02.070> in<00:03:02.370> there<00:03:02.489> this<00:03:02.640> one's<00:03:02.850> darker<00:03:03.420> and

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
orange in there this one's darker and

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.780 
orange in there this one's darker and
this<00:03:04.350> one<00:03:04.500> is<00:03:04.590> a<00:03:04.680> bit<00:03:04.860> more<00:03:04.890> I'm<00:03:05.340> not<00:03:05.400> getting

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
this one is a bit more I'm not getting

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.390 
this one is a bit more I'm not getting
