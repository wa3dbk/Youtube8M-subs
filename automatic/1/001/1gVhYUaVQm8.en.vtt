00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.950
 hello everyone today I 'm going to show you how 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.990
 make a chicken as easy as possible and 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.300
 I assure you that you will love the recipe 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.120
 It's super easy and they can do it in 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.420
 few minutes first I have here in 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:22.170
 my chicken vessel thawed already 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:26.700
 previously they just put it in the 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:32.450
 vessel then let's make a mixture 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:35.240
 with lemon is the juice of a large lemon 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.650
 as you can see here 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:41.410
 they only squeeze it very well 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.480
 it may be I have this as yellow 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.390
 yellow lemon but it can be the green 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.790
 Big's 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:52.740
 it squeezes very very well 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.320
 they take all the juice 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:58.710
 this recipe is delicious salt the chicken 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.900
 very rich and they do not take long after 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.640
 we add 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:07.710
 what it is is 2 tablespoons of oil 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.930
 olive 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.850
 if they do not have olive oil it can be 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.510
 regular oil only two 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.510
 teaspoons 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.270
 you add 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.270
 Salt 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.960
 more or less groping him the 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.520
 a little bit of salt and of course 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.979
 Pepper 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.979
 all they have to do is stir 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.119
 stir very well how it looks here and 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:42.650
 was this going to be like a dressing 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:46.060
 for our chicken then only 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:50.630
 we emptied the whole mixture over the chicken 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.850
 so that everything is combined very well and not 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.540
 there is a need if they do it is because 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:01.490
 they do not even need to 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:03.890
 season the cabbage there is no need anymore 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.140
 once they have this only the stir 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.850
 the day 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:13.210
 they stir them that all the chicken is full 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:18.040
 is filled with the mixture we made for 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:20.590
 to hold the lemon juice well 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.069
 the pepper and the salt since we have it 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.069
 A) Yes 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.019
 we bring 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.610
 what is our pan 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:39.920
 and we're going to put the chicken 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.920
 well in the pan as well as you can see 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.570
 final that recently on it 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.890
 face the smell 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.410
 once they have it there the chicken 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:59.349
 then they are going to empty them there 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.560
 same in the pan what is the mixture 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:04.610
 who left what was left they did 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.700
 well fine the chicken 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:11.400
 and they'll put it on the stove if they have 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.560
 preferably cover the cover glass 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.500
 done yes or if they do not have to charge it with 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.170
 aluminum so everything is steam 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.480
 it's from that thing comes the steam is going to 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.970
 leaving rich does not take long because 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.209
 as you chicken legs are 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:30.450
 little legs and I hope you like it 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.670
 make the recipe is healthy if they have 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.910
 olive oil is better is healthy 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.620
 it's fast and it's almost all economical 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.230
 these continue then we have at home 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.230
 so be careful and saved
