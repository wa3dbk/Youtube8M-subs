00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
adorable but was in very poor condition

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.679 
adorable but was in very poor condition
when<00:01:43.290> she<00:01:43.470> came<00:01:43.680> in<00:01:43.950> was<00:01:44.189> in<00:01:44.340> shock<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:45.420> so

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
when she came in was in shock and so

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.569 
when she came in was in shock and so

she's currently in our ICU getting

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.819 
she's currently in our ICU getting
treatment<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.689> we<00:01:48.840> talked<00:01:49.079> about<00:01:49.229> how<00:01:49.590> long

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
treatment that we talked about how long

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.649 
treatment that we talked about how long
you<00:01:50.040> guys<00:01:50.189> are<00:01:50.520> estimating<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.240> dogs<00:01:51.450> were

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
you guys are estimating the dogs were

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.690 
you guys are estimating the dogs were
there<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.710> were<00:01:52.829> saying<00:01:53.159> with<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.399> water

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
there and you were saying with a water

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.249 
there and you were saying with a water
source<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.390> think<00:01:54.630> they<00:01:54.750> did<00:01:54.930> find<00:01:55.170> the

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
source and you think they did find the

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.389 
source and you think they did find the
water<00:01:55.439> source<00:01:55.829> yeah<00:01:56.009> there's<00:01:56.369> definitely

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
water source yeah there's definitely

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.530 
water source yeah there's definitely
some<00:01:56.850> it's<00:01:57.600> it's<00:01:57.930> an<00:01:58.049> abandoned<00:01:58.439> apartment

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
some it's it's an abandoned apartment

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.539 
some it's it's an abandoned apartment
it's<00:02:00.540> so<00:02:00.689> filthy<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.320> really<00:02:02.040> can't<00:02:02.280> stand

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
it's so filthy you really can't stand

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.550 
it's so filthy you really can't stand
sit<00:02:03.270> well<00:02:03.479> I<00:02:03.540> can<00:02:03.750> make<00:02:03.840> normal<00:02:04.170> possible

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
sit well I can make normal possible

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.749 
sit well I can make normal possible
adjustments<00:02:04.950> where<00:02:05.100> you're<00:02:05.219> not<00:02:05.310> in<00:02:05.369> filled

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
adjustments where you're not in filled

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.469 
adjustments where you're not in filled
full<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:06.329> fleas<00:02:06.659> roaches<00:02:07.560> and

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
full of fleas roaches and

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.600 
full of fleas roaches and
so<00:02:08.660> I<00:02:09.020> don't<00:02:09.319> doubt<00:02:09.530> that<00:02:09.590> particularly<00:02:10.399> in<00:02:10.580> a

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
so I don't doubt that particularly in a

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.910 
so I don't doubt that particularly in a
puppy's<00:02:10.940> case<00:02:11.150> was<00:02:12.080> not<00:02:12.230> a<00:02:12.290> good<00:02:12.470> water<00:02:12.680> source

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
puppy's case was not a good water source

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.759 
puppy's case was not a good water source
so<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.400> puppy<00:02:13.730> was<00:02:14.690> on<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:14.930> first<00:02:15.170> floor<00:02:15.379> this

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
so the puppy was on the first floor this

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.680 
so the puppy was on the first floor this
dog<00:02:15.950> was<00:02:16.099> on<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.340> third<00:02:16.519> floor<00:02:16.550> we<00:02:17.300> think<00:02:17.599> they

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
dog was on the third floor we think they

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.330 
dog was on the third floor we think they
might<00:02:17.870> be<00:02:18.019> related<00:02:18.140> we're<00:02:18.530> doing<00:02:19.099> a<00:02:19.160> further

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
might be related we're doing a further

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.300 
might be related we're doing a further
investigation<00:02:19.519> to<00:02:20.090> find<00:02:20.360> out<00:02:20.540> but<00:02:20.780> I<00:02:21.709> would

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
investigation to find out but I would

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.979 
investigation to find out but I would
say<00:02:22.459> this<00:02:22.580> dog<00:02:22.730> three<00:02:23.060> to<00:02:23.150> four<00:02:23.330> weeks<00:02:23.569> as<00:02:23.780> far

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
say this dog three to four weeks as far

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.460 
say this dog three to four weeks as far
as<00:02:24.110> a<00:02:24.140> starvation<00:02:24.620> process<00:02:25.660> so<00:02:26.660> we<00:02:27.140> think<00:02:27.349> that

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
as a starvation process so we think that

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.020 
as a starvation process so we think that
maybe<00:02:27.650> she<00:02:27.890> found<00:02:28.069> a<00:02:28.160> water<00:02:28.370> source<00:02:28.670> through<00:02:28.940> a

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
maybe she found a water source through a

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.870 
maybe she found a water source through a
toilet<00:02:29.540> or<00:02:29.680> leaking<00:02:30.680> pipe<00:02:31.280> somewhere<00:02:31.640> or

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
toilet or leaking pipe somewhere or

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.850 
toilet or leaking pipe somewhere or
something<00:02:32.060> like<00:02:32.330> that<00:02:32.390> and<00:02:32.810> as<00:02:33.349> we<00:02:33.500> said<00:02:33.709> the

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
something like that and as we said the

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.559 
something like that and as we said the
amazing<00:02:34.190> thing<00:02:34.310> is<00:02:34.340> that<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:34.580> puppy<00:02:34.940> would

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
amazing thing is that the puppy would

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:36.970 
amazing thing is that the puppy would
have<00:02:35.690> survived<00:02:36.080> because<00:02:36.200> that<00:02:36.410> puppy<00:02:36.709> was<00:02:36.830> so

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
have survived because that puppy was so

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.400 
have survived because that puppy was so
small<00:02:37.340> but<00:02:37.700> it's<00:02:37.879> amazing<00:02:38.360> exact<00:02:38.720> dog<00:02:39.019> lived

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
small but it's amazing exact dog lived

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.920 
small but it's amazing exact dog lived
any<00:02:39.769> but<00:02:40.430> they<00:02:40.580> were<00:02:41.000> estimating<00:02:41.750> that<00:02:41.870> the

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
any but they were estimating that the

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.120 
any but they were estimating that the
puppy<00:02:42.290> is<00:02:42.380> about<00:02:42.560> four<00:02:42.830> months<00:02:43.160> old<00:02:43.250> and<00:02:45.130> the

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
puppy is about four months old and the

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.970 
puppy is about four months old and the
condition<00:02:46.640> of<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:46.910> puppy<00:02:47.360> you<00:02:48.319> know<00:02:48.440> she

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
condition of the puppy you know she

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.250 
condition of the puppy you know she
obviously<00:02:49.280> you<00:02:49.790> can<00:02:49.970> see<00:02:50.120> how<00:02:50.269> emaciated<00:02:50.569> she

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
obviously you can see how emaciated she

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.420 
obviously you can see how emaciated she
is<00:02:51.410> but<00:02:51.739> the<00:02:52.400> puppy<00:02:52.730> was<00:02:52.940> much<00:02:53.390> worse<00:02:53.660> off<00:02:53.870> so

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
is but the puppy was much worse off so

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.949 
is but the puppy was much worse off so
that's<00:02:55.430> why<00:02:55.640> you<00:02:56.209> know<00:02:56.360> she's<00:02:56.660> in<00:02:56.840> the

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
that's why you know she's in the

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.870 
that's why you know she's in the
hospital<00:02:57.110> and<00:02:57.739> it<00:02:57.829> will<00:02:58.040> be<00:02:58.160> give<00:02:58.340> me<00:02:58.370> a<00:02:58.519> sense

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
hospital and it will be give me a sense

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.360 
hospital and it will be give me a sense
