dissolved<00:04:14.140> really<00:04:14.590> really<00:04:14.830> well<00:04:15.480> so<00:04:16.480> I<00:04:16.959> don't

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
dissolved really really well so I don't

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.449 
dissolved really really well so I don't
know<00:04:17.290> if<00:04:17.320> that's<00:04:17.530> good<00:04:17.769> because<00:04:17.919> I'm<00:04:18.340> pretty

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
know if that's good because I'm pretty

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:25.110 
know if that's good because I'm pretty
greasy<00:04:18.760> but<00:04:19.269> good<00:04:20.160> go<00:04:21.160> spray<00:04:21.489> a<00:04:21.519> little<00:04:21.820> more

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:34.170 

I<00:04:30.900> get<00:04:31.900> really<00:04:32.139> greasy<00:04:32.470> just<00:04:32.919> like<00:04:33.070> switch<00:04:34.000> up

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
I get really greasy just like switch up

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.840 
I get really greasy just like switch up
your<00:04:34.210> different<00:04:34.600> layers<00:04:38.070> and<00:04:39.070> I<00:04:39.400> ready<00:04:39.550> I<00:04:39.639> can

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
your different layers and I ready I can

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.850 
your different layers and I ready I can
feel<00:04:40.150> like<00:04:40.419> it's<00:04:40.630> way<00:04:40.930> less<00:04:41.139> greasy<00:04:41.500> it<00:04:41.680> just

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
feel like it's way less greasy it just

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.000 
feel like it's way less greasy it just
absorbs<00:04:42.310> all<00:04:42.550> the<00:04:42.580> oils<00:04:43.540> and<00:04:43.780> everything<00:04:44.139> what

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
absorbs all the oils and everything what

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.840 
absorbs all the oils and everything what
doesn't<00:04:45.280> dry<00:04:45.460> out<00:04:45.490> your<00:04:45.580> hair<00:04:45.820> completely

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
doesn't dry out your hair completely

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.189 
doesn't dry out your hair completely
it's<00:04:48.850> definitely<00:04:49.030> a<00:04:49.240> good<00:04:49.389> alternative<00:04:49.540> if

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199 
it's definitely a good alternative if

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:52.020 
it's definitely a good alternative if
you<00:04:50.500> are<00:04:50.710> running<00:04:51.040> late<00:04:51.310> or<00:04:51.580> if<00:04:51.669> like<00:04:51.820> you're<00:04:52.000> a

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
you are running late or if like you're a

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.210 
you are running late or if like you're a
student<00:04:52.360> and<00:04:52.570> you<00:04:53.139> don't<00:04:53.320> really<00:04:53.650> care<00:04:54.070> about

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
student and you don't really care about

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.070 
student and you don't really care about
how<00:04:54.490> you<00:04:54.520> look<00:04:54.729> for<00:04:55.360> school<00:04:55.630> but<00:04:55.780> you<00:04:55.840> want<00:04:56.020> to

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
how you look for school but you want to

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.529 
how you look for school but you want to
look<00:04:56.229> like<00:04:56.440> kind<00:04:57.190> of<00:04:57.430> not<00:04:57.669> like<00:04:58.120> a<00:04:58.150> huge

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
look like kind of not like a huge

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:00.659 
look like kind of not like a huge
greaseball<00:04:59.110> but<00:04:59.949> this<00:05:00.190> will<00:05:00.340> definitely<00:05:00.490> help

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
greaseball but this will definitely help

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:04.340 
greaseball but this will definitely help

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
you can hopefully see it looks a lot

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.310 
you can hopefully see it looks a lot
better<00:05:06.699> like<00:05:07.000> it's<00:05:07.150> not<00:05:07.389> all<00:05:07.510> like<00:05:07.630> sticking

feel<00:05:48.039> like<00:05:48.490> they<00:05:48.669> could<00:05:48.729> have<00:05:48.940> toned<00:05:49.180> down<00:05:49.389> a

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450 
feel like they could have toned down a

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.890 
feel like they could have toned down a
little<00:05:49.750> bit<00:05:49.960> cuz<00:05:51.090> sometimes<00:05:52.090> when<00:05:52.360> I'm<00:05:52.539> out<00:05:52.690> I

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
little bit cuz sometimes when I'm out I

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.110 
little bit cuz sometimes when I'm out I
can<00:05:53.080> actually<00:05:53.380> like<00:05:53.500> randomly<00:05:53.979> just<00:05:54.190> smell<00:05:54.820> my

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120

can actually like randomly just smell my
hair<00:05:55.389> and<00:05:55.630> I'm<00:05:55.780> like<00:05:55.870> oh<00:05:56.110> that's<00:05:56.440> too<00:05:56.650> strong

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
like if I can smell and I should be used
