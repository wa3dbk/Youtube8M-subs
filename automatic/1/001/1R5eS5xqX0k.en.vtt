00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.529

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.940
 came this boyfriend of testing in this 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.950
 opportunity I will show you how 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.500
 can complete the queen's contract 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.210
 called twisted claws to be able 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.850
 complete this contract we will have to 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.710
 simply start a patrol in the 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.230
 moon and direct us to the location 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.820
 which is called the grave of the world if not 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.109
 get to know this location is not 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.269
 worry just follow the 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.609
 travel that took in this video and already of 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.619
 that way they can easily get good 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.450
 here once I take the opportunity to tell you 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.460
 that if they need to complete any 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.260
 another contract of the contracts of the 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.109
 queen in the description of this video 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.820
 I'm going to leave the playlist with all the 

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:43.379
 Queen's contracts as they can 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.239
 complete how you can find the 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.590
 enemies obviously so they can 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.239
 complete all these contracts 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.670
 easily and can win all the 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.469
 Experience the anger of the good queen 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.090
 this tour is somewhat extensive so 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.219
 for that reason I'm going to place the first 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.379
 part of this video in fast camera 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.059
 here they will find enough enemies 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.280
 and what they can do is simply 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.870
 avoid them as I am doing or what 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.580
 what they can do is also kill them 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.829
 so they can gain experience for 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.420
 improve their weapons and their armor all 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:11.340
 it depends on what they want to do 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.140
 we no longer come to this area called 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.000
 circle of bones we can add towards the 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.860
 left or right from the 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.600
 two sides we will reach the tomb of 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.189
 world but I advise you to go 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.930
 the right since we got a lot more 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.729
 fast good and once we are arriving 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.920
 here in the area called the tomb of 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.830
 world let's meet with three 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.170
 level 28 vandals who do not have in their 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.539
 name the name of vandals but they will 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.880
 they call it twisted claw then good 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:37.320
 are basically these three enemies that 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.659
 we have to eliminate they are also 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.819
 accompanied by some slags but 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.590
 they are pretty easy to kill 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:45.509
 then very good already once they kill 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.030
 these three enemies to these three 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.890
 vandals called twisted claw then 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.929
 with that we can now complete the contract 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.149
 so I hope you liked the 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:56.280
 video if they do not forget to leave their life 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.780
 favorites comment how you have 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.759
 looked like these queen missions and 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.869
 of course do not forget to subscribe to 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.310
 channel if they are still not efficient 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.530
 I hope you can complete this 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.350
 contract obviously win the experience 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.860
 of the queen's wrath and we go to 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.860
 the next 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.590
 and that's it
