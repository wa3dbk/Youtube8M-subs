00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 hello everyone with you max and today I 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:09.840
 I show you how to make the train is doing here 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:20.460
 such a small frame and two here 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:25.350
 block so so these break down blocks so so 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:29.070
 so so so so so so so so 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.590
 we left here is how it looks like 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.820
 I already tried here let's break 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:39.320
 its so so so so so so so so 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:44.300
 so now we put here 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.300
 ordinary piston so so 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:01:02.010
 then we put it here can be done as 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:07.860
 here on one so here so so so so 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:10.770
 so let it not be very big to do 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.650
 because he simply will not start ayub 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:18.360
 al and we have so small here 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:23.040
 such here then completed yet 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:32.420
 they are rolls so now 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:32.420
 we put on here like this 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:44.490
 so now we put sticky pistons here so 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:47.000
 so so so here we have failed so 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.000
 So 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:56.490
 top of the house is all here with us 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:59.370
 turned out there should put beards 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.290
 track and then there will be such a bug when we 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:09.740
 we will go we will fail 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:12.750
 and I will also network for so well so 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:15.260
 it turns out we break then we put 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.260
 backwards 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.110
 so still 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.710
 will become 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.200
 back for have to break off here because 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.210
 that we will need to put sticky 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:38.070
 pistons 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:40.430
 damn what 's the matter put sticky here 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.430
 pistons 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:53.370
 of this side we approach this way this way 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:59.340
 so everything is ready 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:03.150
 we train himself ready now here here 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:09.780
 Miss us, for example, we put a block 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:14.270
 here we put the block here we break now 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.270
 We put here a block with a doctor 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:21.000
 look we move one block but 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:24.230
 and so on, you can eat endlessly for everyone 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.230
 thank you for your attention bye
