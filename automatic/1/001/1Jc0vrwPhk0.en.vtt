00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
back you don't want to make the skin

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.980 
back you don't want to make the skin
look<00:02:12.000> too<00:02:12.420> stretched

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.720

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
okay so it looks pretty rough now you go

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.230 
okay so it looks pretty rough now you go
back<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.090> opacity<00:02:19.820> and<00:02:20.820> we<00:02:20.940> can<00:02:21.090> just

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
back to the opacity and we can just

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.140 
back to the opacity and we can just
smooth<00:02:21.540> that<00:02:21.780> down<00:02:21.810> by<00:02:22.350> putting<00:02:23.150> fifty

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
smooth that down by putting fifty

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.830 
smooth that down by putting fifty
percent<00:02:24.420> back<00:02:24.660> something<00:02:24.990> like<00:02:25.230> that<00:02:26.780> like<00:02:27.780> I

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
from where we'd want it to be you know

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.600 
from where we'd want it to be you know
we<00:03:45.989> could<00:03:46.110> work<00:03:46.290> on<00:03:46.470> that<00:03:46.650> layin<00:03:47.010> out<00:03:47.130> and<00:03:47.430> use

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
we could work on that layin out and use

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.810 
we could work on that layin out and use
that<00:03:47.640> as<00:03:47.820> our<00:03:48.000> base<00:03:48.270> black<00:03:48.570> and<00:03:48.750> white<00:03:49.790> what<00:03:50.790> I

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
that as our base black and white what I

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.550 
that as our base black and white what I
could<00:03:51.060> do<00:03:51.209> from<00:03:51.420> that<00:03:51.480> layer<00:03:51.840> is<00:03:52.080> just<00:03:52.320> raise

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
could do from that layer is just raise

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.110 
could do from that layer is just raise
up<00:03:52.739> the<00:03:52.770> curves<00:03:53.070> a<00:03:53.250> little<00:03:53.280> bitch<00:03:53.640> to<00:03:53.670> give<00:03:54.000> us

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
up the curves a little bitch to give us

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.510 
up the curves a little bitch to give us
a<00:03:54.180> bit<00:03:54.270> of<00:03:54.330> brightness<00:03:54.570> and<00:03:55.370> duplicate<00:03:56.370> that

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
a bit of brightness and duplicate that

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.420 
a bit of brightness and duplicate that
layer<00:03:56.580> down<00:03:57.030> again<00:03:57.390> and<00:03:57.890> go<00:03:58.890> to<00:03:58.950> my<00:03:59.160> layers

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
layer down again and go to my layers

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.460 
layer down again and go to my layers
palette<00:03:59.880> here<00:04:00.090> and<00:04:00.300> add<00:04:00.420> soft<00:04:00.780> or<00:04:00.989> hard<00:04:01.020> light

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
palette here and add soft or hard light

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.630 
palette here and add soft or hard light
and<00:04:01.650> this<00:04:01.709> is<00:04:01.860> where<00:04:02.010> again<00:04:02.160> what<00:04:02.340> gives<00:04:02.520> us

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
and this is where again what gives us

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.160 
and this is where again what gives us
that<00:04:02.730> depth<00:04:03.030> than<00:04:03.270> that<00:04:03.450> punch<00:04:03.720> and<00:04:03.930> a<00:04:03.959> little

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
that depth than that punch and a little

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.100 
that depth than that punch and a little
more<00:04:04.350> heaviness<00:04:05.130> in<00:04:05.400> the<00:04:05.520> shadows<00:04:05.959> so<00:04:06.959> I'll

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
more heaviness in the shadows so I'll

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.050 
more heaviness in the shadows so I'll
soft<00:04:07.350> light<00:04:07.560> in<00:04:07.739> there<00:04:07.980> I<00:04:08.190> can<00:04:08.520> drag<00:04:08.700> it<00:04:08.880> down

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
soft light in there I can drag it down

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.600 
soft light in there I can drag it down
to<00:04:09.300> about<00:04:09.920> sixty<00:04:10.920> percent<00:04:11.010> and<00:04:11.370> that<00:04:11.459> will

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
to about sixty percent and that will

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.580 
to about sixty percent and that will
vary<00:04:11.880> on<00:04:12.090> depending<00:04:12.510> on<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:12.900> tonal<00:04:13.230> quality

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
vary on depending on the tonal quality

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.830 
vary on depending on the tonal quality
of<00:04:13.739> the<00:04:13.830> image<00:04:14.070> on<00:04:14.250> how<00:04:14.880> much<00:04:15.090> I<00:04:15.239> take<00:04:15.480> in<00:04:15.690> and

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
of the image on how much I take in and

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.030 
of the image on how much I take in and
how<00:04:15.900> much<00:04:16.080> I<00:04:16.169> leave<00:04:16.350> out<00:04:16.380> so<00:04:16.709> I'll<00:04:16.770> go<00:04:16.859> back<00:04:16.980> to

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
how much I leave out so I'll go back to

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.760 
how much I leave out so I'll go back to
my<00:04:17.160> Dodge<00:04:17.430> tool<00:04:17.730> a<00:04:17.930> fairly<00:04:18.930> large<00:04:19.109> Dodge<00:04:19.470> tool

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.400 
my Dodge tool a fairly large Dodge tool
just<00:04:20.100> on<00:04:20.280> the<00:04:20.400> light<00:04:20.609> areas<00:04:21.060> not<00:04:22.020> being<00:04:22.229> too

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
just on the light areas not being too

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:28.179 
just on the light areas not being too
specific<00:04:22.530> here

00:04:28.179 --> 00:04:28.189 

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:31.640 

okay<00:04:29.189> again<00:04:29.490> just<00:04:29.669> touch<00:04:29.879> more<00:04:30.180> on<00:04:30.360> the<00:04:30.590> on<00:04:31.590> the

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
okay again just touch more on the on the

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.219 
okay again just touch more on the on the
face<00:04:32.039> and<00:04:32.370> go<00:04:32.610> back<00:04:32.819> to<00:04:32.939> my<00:04:33.060> burn<00:04:33.270> tool<00:04:33.569> quite<00:04:34.199> a

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
face and go back to my burn tool quite a

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:36.920 
face and go back to my burn tool quite a
large<00:04:34.650> burn<00:04:34.979> tool<00:04:35.250> again<00:04:35.610> and<00:04:35.659> just<00:04:36.659> little

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
large burn tool again and just little

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.360 
large burn tool again and just little
vignette<00:04:37.349> and<00:04:37.530> like<00:04:37.620> I<00:04:37.740> like<00:04:37.949> to<00:04:38.069> add<00:04:38.159> round

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
vignette and like I like to add round

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.580 
vignette and like I like to add round
the<00:04:38.430> shots<00:04:38.810> just<00:04:39.810> going<00:04:39.990> to<00:04:40.050> bring<00:04:40.319> out<00:04:40.469> the

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
the shots just going to bring out the

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.200 
the shots just going to bring out the
eyes<00:04:40.710> a<00:04:40.740> little<00:04:41.009> bit<00:04:41.099> so<00:04:41.400> again<00:04:41.610> we<00:04:41.879> can<00:04:42.030> work

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
eyes a little bit so again we can work

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.640 
eyes a little bit so again we can work
on<00:04:42.389> another<00:04:42.539> layer<00:04:43.849> so<00:04:44.849> we<00:04:44.939> go<00:04:45.060> into<00:04:45.210> the<00:04:45.419> eyes

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
on another layer so we go into the eyes

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:51.050 
on another layer so we go into the eyes
we<00:04:46.650> duplicate<00:04:47.159> our<00:04:47.310> layer<00:04:47.580> here<00:04:49.729> okay<00:04:50.729> so<00:04:50.789> if

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
we duplicate our layer here okay so if

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.439 
we duplicate our layer here okay so if
we<00:04:51.150> go<00:04:51.270> to<00:04:51.330> a<00:04:51.449> Dodge<00:04:51.810> tool<00:04:52.080> first<00:04:52.409> of<00:04:52.590> all<00:04:53.449> quite

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
we go to a Dodge tool first of all quite

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:56.089 
we go to a Dodge tool first of all quite
small<00:04:54.719> Dodge<00:04:54.930> tool<00:04:55.199> just<00:04:55.409> lighting<00:04:55.860> up<00:04:55.979> the

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:56.099 
small Dodge tool just lighting up the

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:59.149 
small Dodge tool just lighting up the
whites<00:04:57.050> line<00:04:58.050> up<00:04:58.289> the<00:04:58.409> color<00:04:58.680> in<00:04:58.919> the<00:04:59.009> eyes

00:04:59.149 --> 00:04:59.159 
whites line up the color in the eyes

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:04.519 
whites line up the color in the eyes
here<00:05:02.029> okay<00:05:03.029> go<00:05:03.300> to<00:05:03.360> our<00:05:03.539> burn<00:05:03.750> tool<00:05:04.050> again

00:05:04.519 --> 00:05:04.529 
here okay go to our burn tool again

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:11.059 
here okay go to our burn tool again
quite<00:05:04.919> a<00:05:04.979> small<00:05:05.189> one<00:05:05.610> just<00:05:08.060> bring<00:05:09.060> back<00:05:10.069> the

00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:11.069 
quite a small one just bring back the

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:14.450 
quite a small one just bring back the
edge<00:05:11.189> of<00:05:11.370> the<00:05:11.520> eye<00:05:11.550> here<00:05:13.039> just<00:05:14.039> trying<00:05:14.250> to<00:05:14.340> make

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
edge of the eye here just trying to make

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.610 
edge of the eye here just trying to make
them<00:05:14.639> both<00:05:14.849> look<00:05:15.120> the<00:05:15.150> same<00:05:15.620> there's

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
them both look the same there's

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.080 
them both look the same there's
different<00:05:16.919> amounts<00:05:17.219> of<00:05:17.310> light<00:05:17.550> falling<00:05:17.879> on

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
different amounts of light falling on

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.420 
different amounts of light falling on
each<00:05:18.240> I<00:05:18.509> here<00:05:18.810> so<00:05:19.439> the<00:05:19.560> reflector<00:05:20.069> is<00:05:20.189> closer

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
each I here so the reflector is closer

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.029 
each I here so the reflector is closer
to<00:05:20.580> this<00:05:20.849> side<00:05:20.909> of<00:05:21.449> the<00:05:21.569> face<00:05:21.830> rather<00:05:22.830> than

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 
to this side of the face rather than

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:25.610 
to this side of the face rather than
this<00:05:23.219> side<00:05:23.460> hence<00:05:23.819> that's<00:05:24.060> why<00:05:24.240> this<00:05:24.409> pupil<00:05:25.409> in

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
this side hence that's why this pupil in

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.200 
this side hence that's why this pupil in
the<00:05:25.710> eye<00:05:25.740> and<00:05:26.069> the<00:05:26.159> iris<00:05:26.430> in<00:05:26.550> the<00:05:26.639> IRS<00:05:26.849> slightly

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
the eye and the iris in the IRS slightly

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.730 
the eye and the iris in the IRS slightly
lighter<00:05:27.449> than<00:05:27.840> this<00:05:28.020> one<00:05:28.259> so<00:05:28.289> I'm<00:05:28.469> trying<00:05:28.620> to

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
lighter than this one so I'm trying to

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.790 
lighter than this one so I'm trying to
make<00:05:28.889> them<00:05:29.009> look<00:05:29.159> nice<00:05:29.580> and<00:05:29.759> even<00:05:30.740> okay<00:05:31.740> so

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
make them look nice and even okay so

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.430 
make them look nice and even okay so
maybe<00:05:32.190> just<00:05:32.430> dark<00:05:32.729> and<00:05:32.879> down<00:05:33.089> the<00:05:33.330> in<00:05:33.449> a<00:05:33.479> bit

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.050 

again<00:05:37.440> nothing<00:05:37.620> to<00:05:37.949> creatively<00:05:38.520> specific

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
again nothing to creatively specific

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.749 
again nothing to creatively specific
just<00:05:39.419> making<00:05:39.750> it<00:05:39.839> nice<00:05:40.020> and<00:05:40.229> balanced<00:05:40.589> if<00:05:41.580> we

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:41.759 
just making it nice and balanced if we

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:44.719 
just making it nice and balanced if we
go<00:05:42.180> back<00:05:42.330> out<00:05:42.539> of<00:05:42.690> that<00:05:42.810> image<00:05:43.099> and<00:05:44.099> go<00:05:44.370> back<00:05:44.580> to

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
go back out of that image and go back to

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:49.430 
go back out of that image and go back to
our<00:05:44.759> opacity<00:05:45.469> so<00:05:46.469> you<00:05:46.560> can<00:05:46.710> see<00:05:48.199> here<00:05:49.199> the<00:05:49.319> eyes

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
our opacity so you can see here the eyes

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.249 
our opacity so you can see here the eyes
are<00:05:49.680> nice<00:05:50.219> and<00:05:50.430> punchy<00:05:50.759> so<00:05:51.629> about<00:05:51.810> seventy<00:05:52.110> six

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:52.259 
are nice and punchy so about seventy six

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:54.140 
are nice and punchy so about seventy six
percent<00:05:52.560> now<00:05:52.740> flatten<00:05:53.520> that<00:05:53.610> back<00:05:53.849> down<00:05:54.029> again

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
percent now flatten that back down again

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.929 
percent now flatten that back down again
and<00:05:54.680> we<00:05:55.680> can<00:05:55.830> change<00:05:56.099> it<00:05:56.339> by<00:05:56.490> our<00:05:56.610> curves

00:05:56.929 --> 00:05:56.939 
and we can change it by our curves

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:59.269 
and we can change it by our curves

different ways we can do this I know how
I<00:06:01.889> work<00:06:02.219> with<00:06:02.400> my<00:06:02.610> lab<00:06:02.849> saw<00:06:03.150> a<00:06:03.180> little<00:06:03.509> bit<00:06:03.629> of

I work with my lab saw a little bit of

I work with my lab saw a little bit of

brightness into this a little bit of
contrast<00:06:07.520> just<00:06:08.520> gives<00:06:08.849> me<00:06:08.909> that<00:06:09.120> punch<00:06:09.569> but

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:09.870 
contrast just gives me that punch but

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.959 
contrast just gives me that punch but
still<00:06:10.199> keeping<00:06:10.500> the<00:06:10.560> nice<00:06:10.860> tonal<00:06:11.279> quality<00:06:11.819> in

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:33.709 
too much of the image that's right by 12
and<00:06:32.849> I<00:06:32.879> last<00:06:33.029> thing<00:06:33.209> we're<00:06:33.300> going<00:06:33.419> to<00:06:33.479> do<00:06:33.569> is

00:06:33.709 --> 00:06:33.719 
and I last thing we're going to do is

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:35.769 
and I last thing we're going to do is
sharpen<00:06:33.990> the<00:06:34.319> image<00:06:34.500> so<00:06:34.770> filter<00:06:35.219> sharpen

00:06:35.769 --> 00:06:35.779 
sharpen the image so filter sharpen

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:37.810 
sharpen the image so filter sharpen
smart<00:06:36.779> sharpen

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:37.820 
smart sharpen

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.870 
smart sharpen
now<00:06:38.060> we<00:06:38.120> can<00:06:38.300> go<00:06:38.450> into<00:06:38.600> the<00:06:38.750> face<00:06:38.990> here<00:06:39.350> I<00:06:39.880> don't

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:40.880 
now we can go into the face here I don't

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.230 
now we can go into the face here I don't
want<00:06:41.030> to<00:06:41.120> sharpening<00:06:41.570> on<00:06:41.750> too<00:06:42.140> much<00:06:42.290> on<00:06:42.560> this

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:43.240 
want to sharpening on too much on this

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.750 
want to sharpening on too much on this
so<00:06:44.240> usually<00:06:44.420> it's<00:06:44.660> below<00:06:44.930> pixel<00:06:45.610> and<00:06:46.610> we'll

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:46.760 
so usually it's below pixel and we'll

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.810 
so usually it's below pixel and we'll
keep<00:06:46.850> our<00:06:47.030> sharpening<00:06:47.540> amount<00:06:47.830> around<00:06:48.830> 30<00:06:49.550> to

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:49.820 
keep our sharpening amount around 30 to

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.240 
keep our sharpening amount around 30 to
60<00:06:50.210> mark<00:06:50.420> again<00:06:51.200> if<00:06:51.320> I'm<00:06:51.440> if<00:06:51.650> I'm<00:06:51.740> using<00:06:51.860> if<00:06:52.100> I'm

60 mark again if I'm if I'm using if I'm

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:53.920 
60 mark again if I'm if I'm using if I'm
working<00:06:52.850> on<00:06:52.910> an<00:06:53.030> image<00:06:53.240> that's<00:06:53.270> quite

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:53.930 
working on an image that's quite

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.560 
working on an image that's quite
dramatically<00:06:54.440> soft<00:06:55.190> then<00:06:55.970> I'll<00:06:56.090> have<00:06:56.240> to<00:06:56.300> be

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:56.570 
dramatically soft then I'll have to be

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:57.970 
dramatically soft then I'll have to be
whacking<00:06:56.780> up<00:06:56.960> the<00:06:57.050> sharpening<00:06:57.470> considerably

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:57.980 
whacking up the sharpening considerably

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.280 
whacking up the sharpening considerably
to<00:06:58.160> bring<00:06:58.340> it<00:06:58.460> back<00:06:58.630> but<00:06:59.630> we<00:06:59.720> can<00:06:59.870> keep<00:07:00.020> it<00:07:00.140> down

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:00.290 
to bring it back but we can keep it down

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:02.260 
to bring it back but we can keep it down
quite<00:07:00.740> nicely<00:07:00.980> for<00:07:01.250> this<00:07:01.370> one<00:07:01.580> it's<00:07:02.090> pretty

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:02.270 
quite nicely for this one it's pretty

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.540 
quite nicely for this one it's pretty
sharp<00:07:02.600> as<00:07:02.750> it<00:07:02.810> is<00:07:02.960> so<00:07:03.710> around<00:07:03.980> the<00:07:04.100> 50<00:07:04.400> mark

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:04.550 
sharp as it is so around the 50 mark

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.100 
sharp as it is so around the 50 mark
should<00:07:04.850> be<00:07:04.970> nice<00:07:05.120> it's<00:07:05.360> a<00:07:05.450> nice<00:07:05.570> element<00:07:05.870> of

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:08.090 
sharpening into that and there we go

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:12.040
