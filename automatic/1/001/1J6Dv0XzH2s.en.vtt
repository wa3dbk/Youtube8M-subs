00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
with and this is going to have a slide

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.940

slide individual at twist motion but

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.310 
slide individual at twist motion but
it's<00:00:50.100> it's<00:00:50.340> very<00:00:50.760> slight<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.329> basically<00:00:52.020> the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
it's it's very slight and basically the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.950 
it's it's very slight and basically the

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
simply means the direction that the

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.370 
simply means the direction that the
twist<00:01:03.570> will<00:01:03.780> flow<00:01:05.150> i'm<00:01:06.150> using<00:01:06.600> my<00:01:06.630> pinky
