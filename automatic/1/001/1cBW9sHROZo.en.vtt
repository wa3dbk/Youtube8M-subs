 for a video, this is a video 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.949

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.900
 fitting so on minecraft for which 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.699
 is not recognized we never know 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.769
 also states that there is no pack of 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.750
 textures so in fact I went back 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.490
 on the server of night of so bobbies 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.619
 world it's been a long time since I was 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.360
 not go back to the server and I was 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.399
 proposed to participate in an event for 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.120
 have fun and well I have no plans at all 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.430
 to make a video 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.610
 I still have in his strikes and so 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.059
 the game sales I have about 30 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.469
 minutes 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.629
 so I made you a little montage of 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.610
 5 minutes with more passengers 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.320
 interesting and as you can see in 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.800
 the more they offered me a beer it's cool 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.110
 to yours so in fact no if I have to 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.809
 unknowingly go up sharply 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.590
 and because I was offered several 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.520
 plots 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:05.400
 so I have one so amelia to port 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.630
 royal and harmonia so I thank the 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.140
 people who offered me these 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.400
 plots 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.310
 and also I think it's mothers 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.619
 so thank you very much then I thank 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.930
 the person who was taking care of that 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.729
 event and by sense he can participate 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.020
 you too say so much because 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.060
 it was not planned it was just really 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.229
 to laugh and thank you also to 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.450
 people who wrote to me when I got 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.490
 so connects on the cervin of the vise 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.110
 so I did not talk about wines and put there 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.180
 it's about helping musical chairs 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.820
 Moreover I said this is the first time 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.290
 that I participate in an event and donkey it 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.360
 you just have to turn in circles and then 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.680
 that the music stops you must quickly 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.049
 direct in a map mode 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.619
 so at the beginning of the video I lost in 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.260
 more and so it was really funny 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.850
 so 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.470
 then if I make you this little 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.090
 video is also to tell you that 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.170
 since I'm going to have some 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.880
 houses to build 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.990
 maybe I'm going to do in 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.190
 video I was proposing some videos for 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.560
 so it's nice so it's true 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.840
 only to make videos on minecraft 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.340
 I do not come so much because I know 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.080
 not really what to say when I 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.310
 build I am focused but I'm going 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.670
 not make an effort and if of you 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.899
 show you do some videos where 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.500
 I build like that I think it 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.290
 can be nice 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.900
 so here I just wanted to say that and 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.030
 then what did I want so low 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.740
 nothing at all here when you can 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.410
 see each time I turn in the 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.850
 opposite direction by an upcoming game 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.120
 recently because in addition I do not arrive 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.750
 hunger 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.520
 I did not disturb me then so 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.520
 there I read you and listened to some 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.830
 instants one are there who is who is a 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.410
 deceives the person who would take care of 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:42.070
 the es20 we fucked a striped cd I think 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.430
 and we hear but that of another I you 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.430
 lets listen 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.930
 So that's what happened you expect it 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.700
 hear a guy who coughs a guy who 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.620
 walk but really how can we 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.330
 to know the music stops its fruits 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.700
 I found it all the same rather 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.769
 Funny she then has theory 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.629
 so I went back to my city that 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.280
 I started in 2012 we are 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:28.010
 proposed two videos for those who 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.269
 have seen and I have advanced so I think that 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.250
 I will make videos too I will 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:34.069

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.110
 also so maybe videos or 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.500
 shoes and in my life everything 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.230
 simply 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.340
 So then what is there then 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.510
