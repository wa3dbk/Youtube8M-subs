00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.410
 if I have to tell you which game 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.010
 that's really me 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.580
 disappointed and I still 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.859
 battlefield 4 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.960
 yes we see the post shanghai here 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.269
 multiplayer ifri demonstration how 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.090
 probably everyone has already been something 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.340
 I know say thumbs 30 times 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.489
 and it does not hurt her again 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.860
 come to hand truphone fanboy 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.000
 Battlefield 4 is what I call 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:45.360
 Do it here because I'm excited about it 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.309
 commander is back and yes that 's true 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.890
 such a feature in battlefield 2 that gave 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.239
 it then so that was so well so as 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.920
 was still using tactics with his 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.539
 mind with teamplay headed that 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.579
 what i am in cleo de all the time always 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.440
 preached that a bit announce 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.000
 should do and so and that by doing so 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.859
 much better can be found now there is 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.539
 for a complete surface you 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.970
 also control external via a tablet 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.979
 can or a big cell phone or something 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.080
 that you can have lying next to you 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.740
 while gambling and that you then serve 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.759
 Can be used as a commander and tactic 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.530
 multiplayer shooter action on fire ii 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.090
 finally again as far as I mean 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.909
 Battlefield 3 was already very much 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.619
 tactically one had to rocket on 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.909
 example better than on vehicles 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.700
 judge as well as infantry your song 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.600
 pack and you were natural as a quad 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:37.079
 always better on the road than alone but 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:40.259
 really, really, there was a strategy 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:43.110
 public also not now you can do it yourself 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.280
 in public matches correctly with strategy 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.280
 if you have a capable one 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.290
 commander has because it is without 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.700
 language barrier the squad just gets 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.200
 he only needs the commander 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.640
 enter a command in his 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.430
 interface and then you get that in 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.079
 your language to the spot songs on 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.310
 thinks the other does not take that 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.740
 It is not a must if the 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.540
 commander said give to c and each 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.459
 100 people and you stand exactly on c 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:11.610
 since 15 clear but normal so if that 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.069
 There are quad points and so you meet 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.799
 maybe see over the 5 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.269
 the spots have to be bigger this beautiful 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:18.680
 and now if you squad this 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.319
 executes commands is already in 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.480
 Battlefield 3 then gave full performance 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.489
 you get those bonuses bonus perks 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.989
 otherwise you are so distinctive here so 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.209
 realizes that he sprinted so fast and 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:32.540
 so what that means you have to actively 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.879
 participate and teamplay will happen 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.409
 rewards these points for the whole squad 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:38.269
 By the way, if the 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:39.980
 whole scott far as long but one 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.200
 Thus, the environment also survives rewarded 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.290
 how will you get the is 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.269
 also really nice so yes it is 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.189
 properly survive the teamplay 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:52.280
 playing smart is rewarded 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:53.389
 playing smart will be rewarding so 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.430
 that I will experience it again 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:59.419
 allowed in our generic today 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.439
 shooter action time very, very nice 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:02.030
 here so I'll be 42 soon 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:05.120
 speed this commander mode 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.310
 already really cool and that she 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.480
 bring him back is worth it I 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.069
 say it is not really looks 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.150
 better off the game you have to 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.609
 Let's be honest 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.290
 Changes are minimal that that 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:16.969
 Nevertheless, the game looks good to you 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.439
 You can rest on your graphic 

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:19.849
 other games can not do that 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:21.620
 afford and they have for years 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:23.569
 you know all what I'm talking about 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.009
 and now they are still lagging years 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.489
 afterwards with what they have shown 

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:31.329
 for alleged action 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:33.409
 well ok that comes back 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:35.209
 of course you have to say it will not 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:36.799
 many new weapons give this one 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.620
 setting is the same as battlefield 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:41.900
 3 some new things are added 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.150
 of course, but by and large 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.560
 it was a huge dlc something call of 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.069
 duty has already done a few times 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.139
 is only mp2 mp3 but in contrast to 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.549
 either two mw 3 sees that here 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:54.500
 really after a progress in the 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.759
 multiplayer range from the single 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.629
 little battlefield interests me 

00:03:55.759 --> 00:04:00.680
 null nada niente not completely honest 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:02.060
 I'm interested in call of duty 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.459
 the singleplayer really great 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.219
 because what should I do with it 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.329
 but here with the commander mode 

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:10.129
 and everybody is here you see again 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:11.209
 that is just at the temple 1 that is 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:12.349
 You can gamble and have at the same time 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.849
 on the second tablet maybe the 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:15.199
 all the time, however, so open me 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:18.979
 I have now bought a tablet before 

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:20.229
 few days and so partly too 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.859
 little used as the rieder 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:23.810
 mainly and a bit too 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.580
 so surf at night in bed and so what what 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.360
 others with their huge iphones one 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.699
 I have one 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:33.139
 it's so close so smoby pad who know it 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:35.150
 In any case, that's what it wants to be 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.129
 then have really cool use so synonymous 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.580
 I'm really looking forward to this game 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:42.409
 especially with the year destructible 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.090
 environments again they do not have 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:46.479
 further expanded so safe at the beginning 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.650
 attract attention with sollbruchstellen 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.419
 of course, so-called fixpoints 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.060
 that is not common to every club 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.620
 Hand down the ground floor is clear now 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.389
 also supports this building here 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.529
 so jump out and escape 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:04.490
 there is just as if she knows 

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:05.719
 border here from edge or border on board 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.000
 exactly there's indeed score points this 

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:08.990
 I can just shoot for example 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.120
 I do not know why 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.830
 In any case, that is as well as 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.909
 but break point in the sense but me 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.110
 find it nice that I the map by 

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:17.050
 can permanently change 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.550
 These are the information that is laid 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.870
 ok so I would like your opinion 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.129
 battlefield 4 because I think that's easy 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.419
 only awesome horny I'm glad yes 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:25.039
 really really thick it is already 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:26.629
 I can guarantee that 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:28.550
 unlike call of duty which i 

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:30.949
 I do not think I 'll ever pre-order 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:34.180
 in the life that you like familia again 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:34.180
 always until then your team 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.960
 that is how it is
