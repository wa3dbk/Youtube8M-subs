00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.160
 communions weddings christenings and what better 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.990
 have to make an opsis video for these 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.510
 such special events in which 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.100
 we want to go a little more neat and 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.470
 before thinking with eyes for the 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.420
 communions vo two digits these events 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.250
 I'm going to give you a couple of tips 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.140
 first of them is that before you go 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.970
 running well to look for a dress 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.589
 look well in your wardrobe background 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.299
 that we always have some dress that 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:49.400
 we can take advantage for this occasion is 

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:51.290
 second advice if you do not have more 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.299
 remedy 9 found nothing in your 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.030
 closet and can not opt for stores 

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:58.220
 more exclusive and you have to resort to 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.080
 our beloved shop for inditex 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.059
 try not to go for the treaties very 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.890
 demanding and very striking because of that 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.260
 way if we agree with someone in the 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.090
 event goes calls much more attention and 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.630
 also another option is to opt for both 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.640
 parts 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.280
 the skirt pants with others 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.189
 because it is also more difficult 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.619
 coincide and finally the advice that you 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:20.840
 21 and very detailed and elegant and 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.460
 you know remember less is more many 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.869
 times when we go made of 20 we cream 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.700
 rules tickets our jewelry two 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.329
 our things and in the end we go worse than 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.329
 usually
