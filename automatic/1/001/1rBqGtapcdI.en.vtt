00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
hiding in lockers there appear to be

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.909 
hiding in lockers there appear to be
lockers<00:03:56.480> all<00:03:56.660> over<00:03:56.959> the<00:03:57.049> place<00:03:57.260> these<00:03:57.620> guys

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:57.919 
lockers all over the place these guys

00:03:57.919 --> 00:03:59.550 
lockers all over the place these guys
really<00:03:58.190> needed<00:03:58.549> a<00:03:58.609> lot<00:03:58.790> of<00:03:58.910> storage<00:03:59.150> space

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
really needed a lot of storage space

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.599 
really needed a lot of storage space
honestly<00:04:00.560> I<00:04:00.590> have<00:04:00.769> kind<00:04:01.010> of<00:04:01.099> mixed<00:04:01.310> feelings

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
honestly I have kind of mixed feelings

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:03.369 
honestly I have kind of mixed feelings
about<00:04:01.669> the<00:04:01.910> gameplay<00:04:02.329> I<00:04:02.599> like<00:04:02.959> not<00:04:03.139> having

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:03.379 
about the gameplay I like not having

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:05.170 
about the gameplay I like not having
weapons<00:04:03.650> and<00:04:04.040> having<00:04:04.220> that<00:04:04.489> scared<00:04:04.790> feeling

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
weapons and having that scared feeling

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.689

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.009

gets<00:04:10.190> a<00:04:10.310> little<00:04:10.489> bit<00:04:10.730> repetitive<00:04:11.030> you'll<00:04:11.810> move

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
gets a little bit repetitive you'll move

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:13.629 
gets a little bit repetitive you'll move
from<00:04:12.230> one<00:04:12.379> section<00:04:12.620> to<00:04:12.769> the<00:04:12.919> next<00:04:12.949> completing

wandering enemy or two and then you'll

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.550 
wandering enemy or two and then you'll
repeat<00:04:17.030> it<00:04:17.180> you've<00:04:17.780> also<00:04:17.900> got<00:04:18.139> to<00:04:18.260> take<00:04:18.380> into

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
repeat it you've also got to take into

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.170 
repeat it you've also got to take into
account<00:04:18.829> that<00:04:19.010> this<00:04:19.190> game<00:04:19.370> is<00:04:19.519> only<00:04:19.639> like

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
account that this game is only like

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.480 
account that this game is only like
about<00:04:20.479> 5<00:04:20.750> hours<00:04:20.930> long<00:04:21.320> so<00:04:21.919> in<00:04:22.039> a<00:04:22.070> game<00:04:22.310> this

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
about 5 hours long so in a game this

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.830 
about 5 hours long so in a game this
short<00:04:22.789> feeling<00:04:23.240> like<00:04:23.389> things<00:04:23.599> are<00:04:23.750> getting

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
short feeling like things are getting

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.930 
short feeling like things are getting
repetitive<00:04:24.260> is<00:04:24.740> kind<00:04:25.280> of<00:04:25.340> a<00:04:25.430> bad<00:04:25.639> thing

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
repetitive is kind of a bad thing

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.640 
repetitive is kind of a bad thing
I'm<00:04:26.120> all<00:04:26.449> for<00:04:26.660> short<00:04:26.840> games<00:04:27.110> I<00:04:27.289> don't<00:04:27.349> hold

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
I'm all for short games I don't hold

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.469 
I'm all for short games I don't hold
that<00:04:27.740> against<00:04:28.130> outlast<00:04:28.610> Porto<00:04:29.060> was<00:04:29.210> one<00:04:29.330> of<00:04:29.419> my

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 
that against outlast Porto was one of my

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:30.700 
that against outlast Porto was one of my
favorite<00:04:29.780> games<00:04:29.930> of<00:04:30.020> all<00:04:30.139> time<00:04:30.410> and<00:04:30.620> the

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
favorite games of all time and the

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.529 
favorite games of all time and the
original<00:04:31.099> wasn't<00:04:31.430> very<00:04:31.550> long<00:04:31.789> either<00:04:32.120> but<00:04:32.449> if

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:32.539 
original wasn't very long either but if

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:33.180 
original wasn't very long either but if
you're<00:04:32.659> going<00:04:32.810> to<00:04:32.930> do

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
you're going to do

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.490 
you're going to do
game<00:04:33.340> short<00:04:33.850> it<00:04:34.180> has<00:04:34.420> to<00:04:34.600> feel<00:04:34.750> fresh<00:04:35.080> all<00:04:35.290> the

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
game short it has to feel fresh all the

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.410 
game short it has to feel fresh all the
way<00:04:35.590> through<00:04:35.920> I<00:04:36.160> think<00:04:36.760> one<00:04:36.940> thing<00:04:37.120> that<00:04:37.300> could

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:37.420 
way through I think one thing that could

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.270 
way through I think one thing that could
have<00:04:37.540> drastically<00:04:38.050> improved<00:04:38.500> outlast<00:04:38.920> was<00:04:39.130> if

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
have drastically improved outlast was if

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.190 
have drastically improved outlast was if
it<00:04:39.370> had<00:04:39.520> some<00:04:39.700> puzzle<00:04:40.060> solving<00:04:40.420> that<00:04:40.990> way<00:04:41.140> you

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
it had some puzzle solving that way you

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.660 
it had some puzzle solving that way you
wouldn't<00:04:41.440> have<00:04:41.620> to<00:04:41.710> give<00:04:41.860> a<00:04:41.890> player<00:04:42.190> weapons

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
wouldn't have to give a player weapons

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.160 
wouldn't have to give a player weapons
and<00:04:42.880> you<00:04:42.970> could<00:04:43.150> break<00:04:43.360> up<00:04:43.510> the<00:04:43.630> hide-and-seek

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.170 
and you could break up the hide-and-seek

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.950 
and you could break up the hide-and-seek
cycles<00:04:44.620> of<00:04:44.710> the<00:04:44.800> game<00:04:45.210> another<00:04:46.210> game<00:04:46.510> mechanic

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
cycles of the game another game mechanic

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.750 
cycles of the game another game mechanic
I<00:04:47.110> had<00:04:47.290> mixed<00:04:47.530> feelings<00:04:47.650> about<00:04:48.010> what<00:04:48.400> we<00:04:48.550> look

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
I had mixed feelings about what we look

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.790 
I had mixed feelings about what we look
behind<00:04:48.970> feature<00:04:49.420> yeah<00:04:50.020> it<00:04:50.110> was<00:04:50.230> horrifying<00:04:50.650> to

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
behind feature yeah it was horrifying to

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.200 
behind feature yeah it was horrifying to
peek<00:04:50.980> over<00:04:51.100> your<00:04:51.340> shoulder<00:04:51.670> and<00:04:51.790> see<00:04:52.000> some

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
peek over your shoulder and see some

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.090 
peek over your shoulder and see some
deranged<00:04:52.480> creature<00:04:52.780> charging<00:04:53.260> after<00:04:53.410> you<00:04:53.620> but

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
deranged creature charging after you but

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.260 
deranged creature charging after you but
it<00:04:54.190> also<00:04:54.280> means<00:04:54.490> you're<00:04:54.700> not<00:04:54.790> looking<00:04:55.120> where

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
it also means you're not looking where

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.680 
it also means you're not looking where
you're<00:04:55.330> going

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
you're going

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.060 
you're going
and<00:04:55.810> I'm<00:04:56.140> probably<00:04:56.290> going<00:04:56.530> to<00:04:56.590> crash<00:04:56.800> into<00:04:56.830> a

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
and I'm probably going to crash into a

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.400 
and I'm probably going to crash into a
wall<00:04:57.270> still<00:04:58.270> even<00:04:58.660> though<00:04:58.750> I<00:04:58.780> didn't<00:04:59.200> really

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
wall still even though I didn't really

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.440 
wall still even though I didn't really
have<00:04:59.530> much<00:04:59.590> practical<00:05:00.370> use<00:05:00.550> for<00:05:00.790> it<00:05:00.880> I<00:05:01.030> kind<00:05:01.390> of

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
have much practical use for it I kind of

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:02.880 
have much practical use for it I kind of
like<00:05:01.630> knowing<00:05:01.930> that<00:05:01.960> I<00:05:02.080> have<00:05:02.290> the<00:05:02.410> option<00:05:02.590> to

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
like knowing that I have the option to

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.430 
like knowing that I have the option to
look<00:05:03.010> behind<00:05:03.160> me<00:05:03.430> if<00:05:03.610> I<00:05:03.760> wanted<00:05:04.090> to<00:05:04.440> outlast

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
look behind me if I wanted to outlast

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.320 
look behind me if I wanted to outlast
also<00:05:05.980> provides<00:05:06.310> suspense<00:05:06.730> by<00:05:06.910> making<00:05:07.270> you

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
also provides suspense by making you

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.910 
also provides suspense by making you
collect<00:05:07.660> batteries<00:05:08.110> to<00:05:08.290> keep<00:05:08.320> your<00:05:08.560> camera

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:08.920 
collect batteries to keep your camera

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.010 
collect batteries to keep your camera
charged<00:05:09.340> now<00:05:09.790> this<00:05:09.970> seemed<00:05:10.180> odd<00:05:10.420> to<00:05:10.450> me<00:05:10.720> as<00:05:10.870> the

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
charged now this seemed odd to me as the

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.450 
charged now this seemed odd to me as the
game<00:05:11.200> didn't<00:05:11.440> really<00:05:11.620> have<00:05:11.740> a<00:05:11.770> restart<00:05:12.340> from

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
game didn't really have a restart from

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.310 
game didn't really have a restart from
checkpoint<00:05:12.760> option<00:05:13.300> so<00:05:13.690> I<00:05:13.720> always<00:05:14.020> wondered

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
checkpoint option so I always wondered

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.360 
checkpoint option so I always wondered
what<00:05:14.500> happened<00:05:14.530> if<00:05:14.920> you<00:05:14.950> ran<00:05:15.220> out<00:05:15.250> of

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
what happened if you ran out of

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.100 
what happened if you ran out of
batteries<00:05:15.880> there<00:05:16.360> were<00:05:16.480> definitely<00:05:16.810> many

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
batteries there were definitely many
