00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
here the plastic is broken on that which

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.819 
here the plastic is broken on that which
is<00:00:45.239> pretty<00:00:45.510> common<00:00:46.020> on<00:00:46.110> these<00:00:46.289> but<00:00:46.559> overall

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
is pretty common on these but overall

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:58.680 
is pretty common on these but overall
she's<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.340> pretty<00:00:47.610> sharp<00:00:47.850> looking<00:00:48.210> sled

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.529 

from<00:00:59.690> the<00:00:59.839> other<00:00:59.960> side<00:01:00.940> get<00:01:01.940> the<00:01:02.059> Sun<00:01:02.269> at<00:01:02.420> my

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
from the other side get the Sun at my

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.530 
from the other side get the Sun at my
back<00:01:02.809> now<00:01:03.140> and<00:01:04.089> that<00:01:05.089> it<00:01:05.210> looks<00:01:05.420> a<00:01:05.479> little

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
back now and that it looks a little

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.060 
back now and that it looks a little
different<00:01:05.720> color<00:01:06.080> but<00:01:06.290> you<00:01:06.320> can<00:01:06.470> actually<00:01:06.619> see

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
different color but you can actually see

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.370 
different color but you can actually see
the<00:01:07.310> numbers<00:01:07.939> that<00:01:08.119> we're<00:01:08.330> in<00:01:08.479> there<00:01:08.750> so

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
the numbers that we're in there so

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.990 
the numbers that we're in there so
that's<00:01:09.619> going<00:01:09.799> to<00:01:09.860> need<00:01:10.070> some<00:01:10.310> buffing<00:01:10.790> but

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
that's going to need some buffing but

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.550 
that's going to need some buffing but
Nick's<00:01:11.600> here<00:01:11.840> and<00:01:11.990> they're<00:01:12.110> on<00:01:12.259> it<00:01:12.409> but

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
hood in just a moment let's see if we

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.340 
hood in just a moment let's see if we
can<00:01:19.970> get<00:01:20.119> better<00:01:20.360> look<00:01:20.570> at<00:01:20.720> some<00:01:20.899> of<00:01:21.020> the<00:01:21.080> track

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
can get better look at some of the track

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.980 
can get better look at some of the track
weather<00:01:21.710> check<00:01:22.039> in<00:01:22.220> here<00:01:22.539> I've<00:01:23.539> got<00:01:23.600> some

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.109 
still pictures of that as well the
speedo<00:01:30.170> seems<00:01:30.649> to<00:01:30.890> work<00:01:31.069> I<00:01:31.340> wouldn't<00:01:31.850> say<00:01:32.000> it's

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
speedo seems to work I wouldn't say it's

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.300 
speedo seems to work I wouldn't say it's
very<00:01:32.360> accurate<00:01:32.569> but<00:01:33.020> they<00:01:33.140> never<00:01:33.350> work<00:01:33.590> the

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
very accurate but they never work the

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.149 
very accurate but they never work the
heat<00:01:34.909> temperature<00:01:35.690> gauges<00:01:35.990> are<00:01:36.440> there<00:01:36.890> but

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
heat temperature gauges are there but

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:38.949 
heat temperature gauges are there but
they're<00:01:37.340> not<00:01:37.490> connected<00:01:38.090> and<00:01:38.299> the<00:01:38.450> tachometer

00:01:38.949 --> 00:01:38.959 
they're not connected and the tachometer

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:42.999 
they're not connected and the tachometer
also<00:01:39.920> does<00:01:40.399> not<00:01:40.670> work<00:01:41.319> so<00:01:42.319> let's<00:01:42.440> open<00:01:42.560> up<00:01:42.830> the

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009

the tool mikuni carburetor the air box
it's<00:02:03.950> supposed<00:02:04.429> to<00:02:04.519> be<00:02:04.729> right<00:02:05.060> here<00:02:05.569> is

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
it's supposed to be right here is

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.229 
it's supposed to be right here is
missing<00:02:06.709> on<00:02:06.860> this<00:02:07.039> slide<00:02:07.369> I've<00:02:07.849> looked<00:02:08.149> around

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
missing on this slide I've looked around

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.359 
missing on this slide I've looked around
I<00:02:08.479> haven't<00:02:08.750> been<00:02:08.869> able<00:02:08.959> to<00:02:09.200> find<00:02:09.440> one<00:02:09.679> but<00:02:09.890> it's

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
I haven't been able to find one but it's

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.250 
I haven't been able to find one but it's
supposed<00:02:10.759> to<00:02:10.910> connect<00:02:11.269> up<00:02:11.420> to<00:02:11.660> that<00:02:11.959> air

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
supposed to connect up to that air

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.100 
supposed to connect up to that air
intake<00:02:12.830> right<00:02:13.069> there<00:02:13.569> so<00:02:14.569> it<00:02:14.629> was<00:02:14.690> supposed<00:02:15.019> to

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
intake right there so it was supposed to

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.740 
intake right there so it was supposed to
be<00:02:15.290> a<00:02:15.319> phone<00:02:15.709> that<00:02:16.670> connects<00:02:17.030> to<00:02:17.209> that<00:02:17.269> and

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
be a phone that connects to that and

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.750 
be a phone that connects to that and
then<00:02:18.110> it's<00:02:18.260> a<00:02:18.379> dead<00:02:18.590> air<00:02:18.739> box<00:02:19.099> it<00:02:19.370> goes<00:02:19.550> down

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
then it's a dead air box it goes down

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.270 
then it's a dead air box it goes down
into<00:02:20.090> these<00:02:20.209> carburetors<00:02:23.500> so<00:02:24.500> we<00:02:24.650> start<00:02:25.010> it<00:02:25.160> up

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
into these carburetors so we start it up

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.910 
into these carburetors so we start it up
see<00:02:26.000> how<00:02:26.150> it<00:02:26.269> sounds

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.490 

the<00:02:30.370> starting<00:02:30.910> drill<00:02:31.120> for<00:02:31.420> these<00:02:31.570> this<00:02:32.140> is

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
the starting drill for these this is

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.460 
the starting drill for these this is
cold<00:02:32.860> so<00:02:33.220> we'll<00:02:34.180> go<00:02:34.390> to<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.810> full<00:02:35.170> choke

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
cold so we'll go to the full choke

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.270 
cold so we'll go to the full choke
position<00:02:35.770> which<00:02:36.430> is<00:02:36.610> one<00:02:36.790> more<00:02:37.000> up<00:02:37.270> pack<00:02:37.600> staff

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
position which is one more up pack staff

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.480 
position which is one more up pack staff
