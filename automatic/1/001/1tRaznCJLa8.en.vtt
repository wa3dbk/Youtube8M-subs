 Well today I bring you this smoked 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:44.280
 in pink with a dark color on the 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.040
 depth than that in the palette I what 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.530
 I look like a wine color 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.740
 but in reality it looks like black I do not know 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.690
 good and you see them they will see it during 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.300

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.670

 I leave the links of my social networks by 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.090

 with the video 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:16.340
 good girls I will start by placing a 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:19.299
 first of all my mobile eyelid and my 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.299
 lower eyelid 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:32.530
 now I will take this course of nix and I will 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:35.720
 to put especially my mobile eyelid 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:39.370
 blurring it so well so that it does not 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.370
 make me folds 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.920
 in this text 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:52.149
 they increase and this 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.149
 this day 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:03.390
 and now take this little salmon and what 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:07.640
 I will put in my account as my color 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.640
 of transition blurring it very well 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:17.130
 now take this palette and take this 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:20.510
 color pink satin and I'll place it 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:23.820
 on my mobile eyelid leaving the corner 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.720
 external of my free eyelid for the 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.720
 next color 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:40.760
 and now take this color as purple 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.670
 like purple wine I do not know I'm not sure 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.000
 what color is it and I will place it in the 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.730
 external corner blurring what between 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.189
 each color so you do not see a line 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.970
 very marked now take this color 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:59.689
 brown cited as wine of a dark color 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:02.239
 and I'll put it in my outer corner 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:05.180
 and I'm going to blur it little by little 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:07.540
 right now I'm not going to worry about the 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.760
 intensity of the color but by creating 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:14.120
 only the transition of colors and 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:18.200
 final retouching colors 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.389
 souza minimum age iron mines if it is 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.109
 necessary, retouch your color of 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:23.109
 transition 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:32.020
 in the middle of now I will take the color purple 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.450
 I take earlier and I'm going to 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:37.540
 place on top of the dark color that 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:41.370
 I placed previously and again I'm going to 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:44.860
 place the dark color for now yes 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.959
 intensify the color and I'll go 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.870
 blurring very well because I want that 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:54.260
 you see a smoked good lie 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.599
 and now take this light color and what 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.909
 I'm going to use it to illuminate the little bone 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:01.710
 of my eyebrows and I'm also going to download a 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:07.520
 little towards the lacrimal 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:07.520
 the 96 time chiguay good 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.819
 again that purple or purple color and 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.209
 I'm going to put it on my eyelashes 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:21.790
 inferiors blurring it very well for 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.820
 go creating the transition of colors in 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.750
 the bottom 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.750
 so so so 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.759
 low 

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:39.129
 now I will take the dark color again 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:42.939
 and I'm going to stick it to my 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:45.729
 tabs to create the transition and 

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:50.669
 connect it to the top with the 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:50.669
 dark part and you see everything in harmony 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.340
 a metalworker 

00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:01.719
 i 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:11.240
 now take the color more clearly from the 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:14.090
 palette and I'm going to use it to illuminate 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:17.139
 the tear blurring it very well for 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:21.050
 that does not look too marked nor 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:23.700
 cuts between each color I'm also going to 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:27.270
 delineate my mobile eyelid 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:30.170
 I will also place eyeliner on my 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.170
 water line 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.860
 and I'm also going to place several layers of 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:39.200
 mask I'm going to put false eyelashes 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.840

 revlon 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:53.500
 it's like a color like a bit 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:02.080
 like wine solÃ­s with the mixture of this 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:05.560
 wild wellton lipstick that is like a 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:08.050

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.840

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:50.200
 bronzer sorry I'm using this 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:53.440
 from jharkhand and 

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:56.190
 in even that is easy 

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.190
 asier 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:03.860
