is<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.769> down<00:00:26.010> itself<00:00:26.460> so<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:26.939> we<00:00:27.119> can't

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
is the down itself so that we can't

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.330 
is the down itself so that we can't
actually<00:00:27.539> see<00:00:27.960> amounts<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:28.890> equipment<00:00:29.070> have

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
actually see amounts of equipment have

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.470 
we look at the seams at the top here we
can<00:01:59.680> see<00:01:59.830> that<00:01:59.950> this<00:02:00.130> seam<00:02:00.340> here<00:02:00.370> is<00:02:01.000> normal

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.480 
can see that this seam here is normal

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.360 
can see that this seam here is normal
but<00:02:02.140> this<00:02:02.290> seam<00:02:02.500> just<00:02:02.680> below<00:02:03.010> it<00:02:03.040> is

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
but this seam just below it is

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.940 
but this seam just below it is
elasticated<00:02:04.060> and<00:02:04.510> this<00:02:05.170> is<00:02:05.290> repeated<00:02:05.560> all<00:02:05.920> the

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
elasticated and this is repeated all the

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.270 
elasticated and this is repeated all the
way<00:02:06.160> down<00:02:06.370> the<00:02:06.520> length<00:02:06.670> of<00:02:06.910> the<00:02:07.000> bag<00:02:07.710> this<00:02:08.710> EXL

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
way down the length of the bag this EXL

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.370 
way down the length of the bag this EXL
technology<00:02:09.850> actually<00:02:10.270> draws<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:10.960> bag<00:02:11.140> in

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
technology actually draws the bag in

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.080 
technology actually draws the bag in
closer<00:02:11.650> to<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.010> board<00:02:12.220> body<00:02:12.490> so<00:02:12.760> that<00:02:12.790> there's

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
closer to the board body so that there's

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.290 
closer to the board body so that there's
less<00:02:13.480> dead<00:02:13.870> air<00:02:14.050> space<00:02:14.080> Baisakhi<00:02:14.980> so<00:02:15.430> you<00:02:16.060> stay

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
less dead air space Baisakhi so you stay

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.570 
less dead air space Baisakhi so you stay
warmer<00:02:16.750> you<00:02:17.140> get<00:02:17.350> warmer<00:02:17.710> quicker<00:02:17.860> and

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
warmer you get warmer quicker and

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.580 
warmer you get warmer quicker and
basically<00:02:19.000> adds<00:02:19.270> a<00:02:19.420> couple<00:02:19.750> of<00:02:19.810> degrees<00:02:19.960> on<00:02:20.410> to

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
basically adds a couple of degrees on to

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.740 
basically adds a couple of degrees on to
the<00:02:20.680> bags<00:02:20.890> temperature<00:02:21.820> rating<00:02:22.210> in<00:02:22.330> terms<00:02:22.540> of

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
the bags temperature rating in terms of

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.130 
the bags temperature rating in terms of
degrees<00:02:23.020> centigrade<00:02:24.900> okay<00:02:25.900> so

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
degrees centigrade okay so

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.200 
degrees centigrade okay so
technology-wise<00:02:27.010> down<00:02:27.640> to<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:27.880> bottom<00:02:28.120> of

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
technology-wise down to the bottom of

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.570 
technology-wise down to the bottom of
the<00:02:28.300> bag<00:02:28.480> and<00:02:28.840> here<00:02:29.620> we've<00:02:29.770> got<00:02:29.950> bullseye

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
the bag and here we've got bullseye

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.910 
the bag and here we've got bullseye
baffles<00:02:31.060> five<00:02:31.330> of<00:02:31.540> them<00:02:31.660> to<00:02:31.810> be<00:02:31.930> precise<00:02:32.320> which

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
baffles five of them to be precise which

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.890 
baffles five of them to be precise which
basically<00:02:33.460> ensure<00:02:33.700> there's<00:02:33.910> a<00:02:33.970> nice<00:02:34.330> even

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
basically ensure there's a nice even

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.020 
basically ensure there's a nice even
spread<00:02:35.050> of<00:02:35.260> down<00:02:35.740> and<00:02:35.980> your<00:02:36.370> toes<00:02:36.610> remain

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
spread of down and your toes remain

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.140 
spread of down and your toes remain
toasty<00:02:37.540> a<00:02:37.980> good<00:02:38.980> feature<00:02:39.190> as<00:02:39.400> well<00:02:39.550> is<00:02:39.910> the

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
toasty a good feature as well is the

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.600 
toasty a good feature as well is the
Sharks<00:02:40.660> end<00:02:40.900> or<00:02:41.290> shark's<00:02:41.710> toe<00:02:41.950> cap<00:02:42.280> which<00:02:42.460> you

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
Sharks end or shark's toe cap which you

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.150 
Sharks end or shark's toe cap which you
probably<00:02:42.850> can't<00:02:43.090> see<00:02:43.150> from<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.480> video

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
probably can't see from the video

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.560 
probably can't see from the video
basically<00:02:45.160> is<00:02:45.310> an<00:02:45.460> angle<00:02:45.850> coming<00:02:46.120> down<00:02:46.240> here

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
basically is an angle coming down here

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.360 
basically is an angle coming down here
and<00:02:47.080> it<00:02:47.200> means<00:02:47.350> that<00:02:47.500> your<00:02:47.620> feet<00:02:47.860> rest<00:02:48.190> in

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
and it means that your feet rest in

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.090 
and it means that your feet rest in
their<00:02:48.490> most<00:02:48.640> natural<00:02:49.180> position<00:02:49.300> for<00:02:49.600> sleep

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
their most natural position for sleep

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.950 
their most natural position for sleep
and<00:02:51.100> there<00:02:51.310> you<00:02:51.400> have<00:02:51.430> it<00:02:51.580> the<00:02:52.270> zero<00:02:52.480> range<00:02:52.810> of

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
and there you have it the zero range of

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.420 
and there you have it the zero range of
sleeping<00:02:53.320> bags<00:02:53.440> available<00:02:54.340> here<00:02:54.580> at<00:02:54.760> web<00:02:55.120> togs
