00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 the fc delius presented by the 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:14.969
 biggest sports betting arena in the world 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:16.800
 bwin jupp heynckes has juventus turin 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.199
 already in an even more important game 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.850
 defeated in 1998 this was the final of the 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.310
 champions league with real madrid hello 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.750
 Mr. Heynckes are the ones in the cabin where 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.029
 otherwise only the easter bunny 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.619
 besides the players after purely may say 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.019
 you many are now counting the chances 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.020
 against juventus turin on 50 50 are you 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.090
 a bit more optimistic yes I want 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.230
 that does not express in percent or 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:43.079
 this is an absolute top team 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.649
 best italy last year champion 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.879
 will be masters again this year 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:51.170
 have been in the last three four years 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.239
 done everything right because 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.230
 forced into the second league and 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.829
 have a whole new team 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.710
 have put together with paolo 1 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.960
 World champion also brought the football 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.540
 plays in the defensive midfield 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.450
 and that's why this is a team 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.090
 sure to the teams include the 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.250
 also the champions league win a lot 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.950
 The game is very structured 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.920
 by juventus turin helps to speed up 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.049
 our side can then be advantageous 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.290
 yes i think that many many factors 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.900
 must play a role tomorrow once 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:32.040
 you know how she plays it juventus 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.710
 that is one on one side 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.409
 typical italian team im 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.049
 defensive behavior but that is one too 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:45.990
 Team the very good forward 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:47.579
 very fast they play very much 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.710
 good in the forward movement in front of everyone 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.500
 things counter and of course it works 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.909
 always attentive to our defense 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.860
 and to be and do not last as 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.060
 It looks like everyone is fit for them 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.619
 actually always the biggest 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.149
 challenge for example what to do 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.770
 I now cope with the strong all crawl 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.000
 so this puzzle again and again 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.200
 to put together new ones 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.700
 yes but that's not just we have 33 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.730
 storm peaks 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.769
 scorer but we also have four top 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.230
 player in the foreign positions with 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:22.760
 thomas müller franck ribéry arjen robben 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.230
 and then shaqiri and then it is 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.450
 Of course, not always easy for me 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.880
 always pick the right players 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.160
 or top players too 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.739
 You say today you are not from the beginning 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.599
 it is clear that he is at the same time 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:39.250
 fc bayern signs a contract 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:41.870
 know that from the beginning that one 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.030
 highly qualified and topkader 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.549
 and that everyone has 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.200
 once he has to reckon that he is not 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.819
 So from the beginning you are playing in here 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.319
 the player's cabin where is exactly her 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.440
 place tomorrow when it gets serious a lot in 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:57.890
 the middle no I always get on 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.709
 the head and wants everything in the 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:05.209
 view field and see my players 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:07.910
 when I speak to them and then hope 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.099
 I discuss that for good 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.930
 but that will not be easy 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.579
 long is the anticipation is on him 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.319
 to look at every case you have to now 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:17.209
 are the international press conference 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.340
 thomas müller is already there and he knows 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.049
 that is the last weakness 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.920
 the trainer today also again clearly 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:28.370
 We are addressed by ourselves because 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.980
 You say that we are younger 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.709
 past too many goals by 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.440
 Standard situations have gotten something 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:39.920
 actually not the whole season before 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:43.549
 The case was there, I was very sure too 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.280
 at opposing standards and there must 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.110
 you just 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.440
 take a closer look at the scene 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.390
 and then specifically opponents 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.420
 what to do with it 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:59.230
 it does not happen again because as well 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:01.360
 Unfortunately, such gates count as far as Thomas 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.130
 müller juventus turin has been around for a long time 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.959
 but yesterday in the city has just as well 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.020
 no better weather brought that way 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:10.090
 around 17 30 are at lucio of andrea 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.920
 pirlo and co then checked into the hotel 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.380
 the final training will take place this evening 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.269
 at 19 o'clock in the alliance arena instead of fc 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.100
 bayern is now back to work 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.810
 home to the street säbener and there 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.190
 Finally, the things for tomorrow 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.410
 to judge we wish one more 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.800
 beautiful ostermontag until then himself 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.800
 together
