00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.869
 I am luisa and belongs to the offspring 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.280
 team of jumpers in the climate and 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.869
 I'll talk to you today with the keywords 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.490
 lose weight and show you what you do 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.220
 many first tournament start over the 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.320
 a career together we sang times 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:35.810
 with a jacket on which I ever 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:37.640
 change clothes directly with him right here 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.130
 There was Christmas at Spring 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.680
 not too short but also natural 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.360
 not too long and, above all, very 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.550
 a lot of freedom of movement and that pleases 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.920
 I'm fine with this one very much 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.780
 are elastic and therefore with an in 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.969
 give the movement as it were with 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.289
 You need support for the bottom 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.019
 also taking leading to the 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:59.390
 Jacket fits here is important that one 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:01.339
 even a rain jacket working hard and 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.800
 People often show up outdoors 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:05.840
 Accordingly, one sees 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.350
 therefore not always stands and can 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.810
 a take raincoat 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.780
 Of course, one extra could be one 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:20.060
 West someone about sexy for protection 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:23.149
 get ready or ride off if it does 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.860
 One is not that warm up 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:29.299
 a beautiful color fits jakett 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.850
 Of course, every tournament also counts 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.979
 a white rose 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:37.190
 Here are a lot easier here now 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.350
 It does not matter if it's completely leather 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.180
 leather or mini leather is there everyone has to 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.110
 we know best and the best 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.110
 best old has 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.049
 Of course, I would have to do that now 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.270
 to buy a strong one 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.920
 I am also poor springreiter 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.950
 also states like these carry here 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.990
 Of course that's a big advantage 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.780
 and that's why I'm sorry, too 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.780
 always nice and also 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.870
 so that you arrive well at the tournament 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.610
 and even the horse also want beautiful fit 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.190
 is , of course, also transport 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.260
 leggings we have now a from the 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.260
 horse if it harms or so he 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.670
 often the trailer partners are longer 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.080
 and the horses then longer 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.020
 and whether they sometimes 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.580
 to be impatient in my opinion 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.010
 but otherwise always follows 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.390
 there is always nice to look natural 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.819
 should and that with dressage riders 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.500
 this is a land use 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.269
 or often at the 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.700
 Then also the sewing in 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:51.680
 There is, for example, in all 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:55.140
 bad suitcase already where everything is in it 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.880
 there is, for example, here if you 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.330
 wants to know how to invite is also a 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:03.900
 qr code to a video from tv 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:07.049
 and more active for the session but one 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.250
 if just at Stilspringen the 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:12.090
 as very much appreciated that 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.980
 is interwoven and there is 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.299
 Of course, all sorts of stuff when you 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.280
 do not have such a whole body 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.380
 and of course, I would like to do a lot 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.130
 It is important for a tournament dance 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.829
 numbers 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.940
 I'd always prefer one of those 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.579
 pack more 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.549
 since the software start then outsourced 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:32.540
 are the bands and accordingly 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:35.250
 I prefer 2 what are now 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.350
 start numbers at the tren de or am 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.359
 be moored asks whether there are 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.030
 the diana burkel hold broken but 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:45.570
 the wto saddle rack accordingly 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:48.480
 none of it now two packs each 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.430
 page one has to accident break them 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.109
 one more replacement for one 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.760
 Of course , sprint also belongs to his 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.390
 protection for the horses also in the 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.359
 parcours 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:00.720
 we'll take that later for the most part 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:02.040
 Irish band u2 the rimpars so in the 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.470
 take an exam 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.840
 the bandages most show jumpers the 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.850
 In any case, also in the course on her 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.650
 Now take a set in front 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.579
 and behind 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:15.230
 also in blue and we take it 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:17.959
 Jump often shares these too 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.239
 blocks will thus be the protection in the 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.400
 is guaranteed but comes off 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.620
 whether she has needed or not 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.090
 Now I'll go to the dressing room with me 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.440
 first try on the whole thing 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.440
 no longer watch out for the army 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.920
 Of course you can see that very much 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.780
 many things are 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.730
 Of course that does not have to be everything 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.740
 some would be the start numbers are one 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.020
 But you do not have to open everything 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:22.670
 Buy once and you do not have to 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.670
 buy everything I bought
