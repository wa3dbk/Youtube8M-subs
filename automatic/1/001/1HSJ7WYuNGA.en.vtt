00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
them to the touchscreen feature on the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.950 
them to the touchscreen feature on the
Vita<00:00:52.280> so<00:00:52.820> a<00:00:52.850> motion<00:00:53.240> before<00:00:53.390> where<00:00:53.780> it<00:00:53.840> was

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
Vita so a motion before where it was

forward<00:00:54.260> backward<00:00:54.710> front<00:00:54.920> punch<00:00:55.100> now<00:00:55.580> it

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
forward backward front punch now it

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:56.980 
forward backward front punch now it
actually<00:00:56.060> doesn't<00:00:56.210> use<00:00:56.390> the<00:00:56.510> button<00:00:56.750> input

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:56.990

anymore<00:00:57.290> so<00:00:57.440> it's<00:00:57.560> just<00:00:57.620> forward<00:00:57.980> back

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
anymore so it's just forward back

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.240 
anymore so it's just forward back
forward<00:00:58.310> swipes<00:00:58.730> on<00:00:58.940> the<00:00:59.060> touchscreen<00:01:00.250> even
