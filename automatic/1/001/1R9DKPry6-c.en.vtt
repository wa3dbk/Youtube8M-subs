00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
time with her mum we sort of have a

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.479

discussion<00:02:30.600> I<00:02:31.050> guess<00:02:31.830> ultimately<00:02:31.950> Hugh<00:02:32.489> he's

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
discussion I guess ultimately Hugh he's

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.890 
discussion I guess ultimately Hugh he's
always<00:02:32.910> going<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.120> make<00:02:33.239> his<00:02:33.360> own<00:02:33.450> cause<00:02:33.690> he's

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
always going to make his own cause he's

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.240 
always going to make his own cause he's
his<00:02:34.050> own<00:02:34.170> man<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.620> I<00:02:35.610> think<00:02:35.910> we<00:02:36.120> just<00:02:37.250> probably

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
his own man and I think we just probably

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.750 
his own man and I think we just probably
raise<00:02:38.549> our<00:02:39.450> opinions<00:02:40.040> give<00:02:41.040> our<00:02:41.160> insights<00:02:41.549> on

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
raise our opinions give our insights on

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.680 
raise our opinions give our insights on
what<00:02:41.970> we<00:02:42.209> think<00:02:42.239> but<00:02:43.970> he's<00:02:44.970> quite<00:02:45.150> opens<00:02:45.450> of<00:02:45.569> it

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
what we think but he's quite opens of it

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.160 
what we think but he's quite opens of it
and<00:02:45.900> I<00:02:46.140> guess<00:02:46.440> that's<00:02:46.590> good<00:02:46.860> you<00:02:47.160> know<00:02:47.340> and<00:02:48.180> in

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
and I guess that's good you know and in

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.770 
and I guess that's good you know and in
the<00:02:49.260> sense<00:02:49.500> real<00:02:49.709> like<00:02:49.980> you<00:02:50.910> know<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.209> team<00:02:51.450> is

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
the sense real like you know the team is

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.900 
the sense real like you know the team is
maybe<00:02:52.560> feeling<00:02:52.799> a<00:02:52.980> bit<00:02:53.069> flat<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.519> we<00:02:53.730> as

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
maybe feeling a bit flat and we as

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.300 
maybe feeling a bit flat and we as
always<00:02:54.810> old<00:02:54.989> me<00:02:55.110> as<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.260> captain<00:02:55.620> I<00:02:55.650> can<00:02:56.160> see
