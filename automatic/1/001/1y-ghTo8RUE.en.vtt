00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
should be working on so start building

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.789 
should be working on so start building
it<00:01:54.179> and<00:01:54.479> don't<00:01:54.990> let<00:01:55.109> anybody<00:01:55.320> see<00:01:55.530> it

that<00:03:43.750> works<00:03:44.019> and<00:03:44.440> it's<00:03:44.650> lightweight<00:03:45.130> at<00:03:45.430> the

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
that works and it's lightweight at the

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:46.890 
that works and it's lightweight at the
time<00:03:45.760> it<00:03:45.940> was<00:03:46.060> one<00:03:46.090> of<00:03:46.329> the<00:03:46.390> lightest<00:03:46.720> weight

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
time it was one of the lightest weight

time it was one of the lightest weight
training<00:03:47.380> shoes<00:03:47.739> in<00:03:47.980> the<00:03:48.070> market<00:03:48.459> so<00:03:49.269> that's

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
training shoes in the market so that's

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.830 
training shoes in the market so that's
like<00:03:49.540> check<00:03:49.870> that<00:03:50.049> box<00:03:50.290> and<00:03:51.390> it<00:03:52.390> just<00:03:52.570> happened

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
like check that box and it just happened

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.090 
like check that box and it just happened
to<00:03:52.930> be<00:03:53.130> really<00:03:54.130> radical<00:03:54.549> and<00:03:54.930> it<00:03:55.930> took<00:03:56.590> off<00:03:56.769> and

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
to be really radical and it took off and

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.330 
to be really radical and it took off and
you<00:03:57.370> know<00:03:57.670> even<00:03:57.940> to<00:03:58.150> this<00:03:58.269> day<00:03:58.510> it<00:03:58.780> has<00:03:58.810> it's

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
you know even to this day it has it's

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.890 
you know even to this day it has it's
it's<00:04:00.340> very<00:04:00.609> polarizing<00:04:01.390> it's<00:04:01.660> really

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
it's very polarizing it's really

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.140 
it's very polarizing it's really
interesting<00:04:02.109> 20<00:04:02.500> years<00:04:02.620> later<00:04:02.890> where<00:04:03.370> we're

of<00:04:42.460> these<00:04:42.580> challenges<00:04:43.120> which<00:04:43.300> is<00:04:43.449> going<00:04:43.570> to

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
of these challenges which is going to

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.180 
of these challenges which is going to
pay<00:04:43.870> dividends<00:04:44.350> down<00:04:44.560> the<00:04:44.620> road<00:04:44.919> for

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
pay dividends down the road for

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.040 
pay dividends down the road for
expanding<00:04:45.790> on<00:04:45.880> the<00:04:45.970> pump<00:04:46.210> cure<00:04:46.419> even<00:04:46.600> even

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
expanding on the pump cure even even

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.540 
expanding on the pump cure even even
more<00:04:47.199> so<00:04:47.380> the<00:04:47.650> thought<00:04:47.889> that<00:04:48.100> you<00:04:48.250> know<00:04:48.310> we<00:04:48.340> can

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
more so the thought that you know we can

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.610 
more so the thought that you know we can
walk<00:04:48.669> the<00:04:48.790> line<00:04:48.970> here<00:04:49.360> and<00:04:49.510> see<00:04:49.960> literally

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
walk the line here and see literally

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.140 
walk the line here and see literally
thousands<00:04:51.250> or<00:04:51.340> tens<00:04:51.520> of<00:04:51.610> thousands<00:04:52.030> of<00:04:52.060> these
