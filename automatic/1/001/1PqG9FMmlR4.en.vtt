00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
nice canceling year piece but I'm really

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.280 
nice canceling year piece but I'm really
quite<00:03:23.880> disappointed<00:03:24.540> in<00:03:24.660> this<00:03:24.810> case<00:03:25.110> that

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
quite disappointed in this case that

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
the package and of course USB cable

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:41.270 
the package and of course USB cable
maybe<00:03:34.920> outside<00:03:39.500> in<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.620> most<00:03:40.800> important<00:03:41.130> is

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
maybe outside in the most important is

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.660 
maybe outside in the most important is
anything

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.809 

really<00:03:45.670> very<00:03:45.849> nice<00:03:46.770> simple<00:03:47.770> actually<00:03:48.340> pick<00:03:48.670> up

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
really very nice simple actually pick up

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.330 
really very nice simple actually pick up
the<00:03:48.940> white<00:03:49.150> one<00:03:49.390> I<00:03:49.630> was<00:03:50.530> contemplating<00:03:50.830> within

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
the white one I was contemplating within

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.530 
the white one I was contemplating within
a<00:03:51.370> black<00:03:51.640> and<00:03:51.880> a<00:03:51.940> white<00:03:52.090> that's<00:03:52.330> all

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
ultimately I went for the white because

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.430 
ultimately I went for the white because
