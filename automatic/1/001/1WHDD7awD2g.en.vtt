00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.790
 hello everyone good to comment good 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.200
 the interest I wanted to tell you that is still here 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:21.080
 in houston 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:24.020
 I've been playing and having spent in 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.610
 the interest of transit then directly 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.740
 you play here and now listen 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.140
 some comments that ristov makes in vale 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.669
 in three different rounds then we go 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.220
 to begin with the first the first 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:37.480
 says at the end of round 2 and now 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.480
 let's hear it so you can see it 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.090
 I knew I had to have invented a 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.810
 robot to lay useless eggs with their 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.810
 rules 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.680
 I just said I knew there had to be 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.780
 invented a robot in a maxis tool 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.920
 to move eggs with their standards and 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.380
 regrets for the one who has not 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.510
 listened well 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:17.340
 now the second thing he said he has 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.340
 been at the end of round 7 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:30.310
 password is the rule 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.480
 ok here I just said I gave you 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.210
 password is a liar and then 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:44.030
 He says I'm not, that's why nobody would say 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:47.120
 just like a radilla bomb is worth then 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.370
 now we go to the next the following 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:53.890
 who says he would say it in the round of 18 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.890
 it's worth at the end where 17 saw 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.960
 it's fun at last we can 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.960
 surprise us 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.479
 Y 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.060
 ok here at the end he said at last 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.900
 we can face this little girl 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.700
 beast quickly turn the machine 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.760
 well there it is, I think it's pretty 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.010
 important to know if each one can 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.530
 give us a little bit and comment on what 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.600
 I just went up 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.040
 and well you already know how to put cane like 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.350
 I'm getting what is that almost not 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.120
 I sleep and you know how to like 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.120
