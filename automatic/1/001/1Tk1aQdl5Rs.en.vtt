quite<00:04:19.120> as<00:04:19.329> comfortably<00:04:20.320> as<00:04:20.409> I've<00:04:21.010> experienced

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
quite as comfortably as I've experienced

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:25.140 
quite as comfortably as I've experienced
with<00:04:21.760> other<00:04:22.120> fightin<00:04:22.900> headsets<00:04:23.590> but<00:04:23.909> there

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
with other fightin headsets but there

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.050 
with other fightin headsets but there
just<00:04:25.780> not<00:04:25.930> great<00:04:26.350> I<00:04:26.680> also<00:04:27.430> like<00:04:27.669> the<00:04:27.790> fact<00:04:28.000> that

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
just not great I also like the fact that

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.480 
just not great I also like the fact that
on<00:04:28.210> the<00:04:28.300> bottom<00:04:28.630> if<00:04:28.750> you<00:04:28.780> pop<00:04:29.080> it<00:04:29.229> open<00:04:29.490> you'll

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
on the bottom if you pop it open you'll

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.790 
on the bottom if you pop it open you'll
find<00:04:30.759> the<00:04:30.880> micro<00:04:31.389> USB<00:04:31.590> connection<00:04:32.590> right<00:04:32.740> here

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
find the micro USB connection right here

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.129 
find the micro USB connection right here
but<00:04:33.190> you'll<00:04:33.340> also<00:04:33.520> see<00:04:33.880> the<00:04:34.060> 3.5<00:04:34.690> millimeter

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
but you'll also see the 3.5 millimeter

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.040 
but you'll also see the 3.5 millimeter
connector<00:04:35.440> which<00:04:36.280> allows<00:04:36.850> you<00:04:37.120> to<00:04:37.150> plug<00:04:37.750> in

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.840 
connector which allows you to plug in
and<00:04:39.720> go<00:04:40.720> wired<00:04:41.320> instead<00:04:42.130> of<00:04:42.220> being<00:04:42.400> Wireless

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
and go wired instead of being Wireless

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.640 
and go wired instead of being Wireless
this<00:04:43.150> is<00:04:43.300> a<00:04:43.330> great<00:04:43.660> feature<00:04:43.900> for<00:04:44.080> example<00:04:44.259> if

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
this is a great feature for example if

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.469 
this is a great feature for example if

you're on an airplane and you want to
listen<00:04:46.630> to<00:04:46.750> music<00:04:46.930> you<00:04:47.259> can<00:04:47.289> turn<00:04:47.530> on<00:04:47.650> the

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
listen to music you can turn on the

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.310 
listen to music you can turn on the
noise<00:04:47.830> cancellation<00:04:48.400> and<00:04:48.759> plug<00:04:49.389> in<00:04:49.600> your

different<00:06:08.699> inserts<00:06:09.699> I<00:06:10.000> found<00:06:10.300> a<00:06:10.630> version<00:06:11.289> that

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:11.470 
different inserts I found a version that

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.110 
different inserts I found a version that
what<00:06:11.650> actually<00:06:11.919> was<00:06:12.039> comfortable<00:06:12.460> enough<00:06:12.849> for

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 
what actually was comfortable enough for

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.450 
what actually was comfortable enough for
me<00:06:13.539> and<00:06:13.780> as<00:06:14.440> I<00:06:14.530> said<00:06:14.590> the<00:06:14.860> noise<00:06:14.979> cancellation

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:15.460 
me and as I said the noise cancellation
