00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:48.520 
the components but here's what happens
no<00:02:32.570> shot<00:02:32.780> clock<00:02:32.810> runs<00:02:33.230> out

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.500 

so<00:02:49.530> it'll<00:02:49.740> do<00:02:49.860> that<00:02:50.010> one<00:02:50.220> if<00:02:50.640> it<00:02:51.180> was<00:02:51.270> a<00:02:51.300> game

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
so it'll do that one if it was a game

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.300 
so it'll do that one if it was a game
over<00:02:51.870> if<00:02:52.020> you<00:02:52.140> have<00:02:52.170> if<00:02:52.440> your<00:02:52.590> shot<00:02:52.770> clock<00:02:53.010> runs

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
over if you have if your shot clock runs

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.970 
over if you have if your shot clock runs
out<00:02:53.520> when<00:02:54.360> you<00:02:54.420> have<00:02:54.569> the<00:02:54.690> ball<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:55.260> still

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
out when you have the ball you still

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.449 
out when you have the ball you still
have<00:02:56.190> a<00:02:56.220> couple<00:02:56.430> more<00:02:56.550> periods<00:02:56.970> left<00:02:58.459> they

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
have a couple more periods left they

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:00.470 
have a couple more periods left they
would<00:02:59.550> just<00:02:59.640> go<00:02:59.760> to<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.880> next<00:03:00.000> period<00:03:00.270> so<00:03:00.450> you

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
would just go to the next period so you

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.820 
would just go to the next period so you
have<00:03:00.600> four<00:03:00.810> periods<00:03:01.020> four<00:03:01.350> balls<00:03:01.560> plus

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
have four periods four balls plus

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.040 
have four periods four balls plus
timeout<00:03:02.250> if<00:03:02.400> for<00:03:02.610> both<00:03:02.910> scores<00:03:03.240> are<00:03:03.510> tied<00:03:03.810> at

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
timeout if for both scores are tied at

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.560 
timeout if for both scores are tied at
the<00:03:04.110> end<00:03:04.200> it<00:03:05.010> obviously<00:03:05.310> worked<00:03:05.520> better<00:03:05.670> as<00:03:06.510> a

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
the end it obviously worked better as a

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.910 
the end it obviously worked better as a
two-player<00:03:07.110> game<00:03:08.150> but<00:03:09.560> when<00:03:10.560> you<00:03:10.650> play<00:03:10.800> the

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
two-player game but when you play the

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.050 
two-player game but when you play the
computer<00:03:11.280> I'd<00:03:11.520> make<00:03:11.700> it<00:03:11.850> so<00:03:12.030> you<00:03:12.090> could<00:03:14.060> the

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
computer I'd make it so you could the

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.670 
computer I'd make it so you could the
computer<00:03:15.420> will<00:03:15.570> like<00:03:15.720> automatically<00:03:16.290> score

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
computer will like automatically score

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.150 
computer will like automatically score
while<00:03:16.890> you're<00:03:17.070> scoring<00:03:18.860> so<00:03:19.860> it's<00:03:19.980> kind<00:03:20.130> of

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
while you're scoring so it's kind of

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
while you're scoring so it's kind of
like<00:03:20.250> a<00:03:20.340> challenge<00:03:20.519> you<00:03:20.760> have<00:03:20.880> to<00:03:20.970> kind<00:03:21.150> of

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
like a challenge you have to kind of

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.490 
like a challenge you have to kind of
beat<00:03:21.360> them<00:03:21.600> even<00:03:21.840> though<00:03:22.260> you're<00:03:22.380> playing

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
beat them even though you're playing

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.990 
beat them even though you're playing
just<00:03:22.830> a<00:03:22.890> single<00:03:23.130> player<00:03:23.340> but<00:03:23.640> that's<00:03:23.850> uh

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
just a single player but that's uh

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.420 
just a single player but that's uh
that's<00:03:24.239> it<00:03:24.450> so<00:03:24.600> far<00:03:24.630> so<00:03:25.560> here<00:03:25.739> is<00:03:25.830> inside<00:03:26.160> the

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
that's it so far so here is inside the

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.890 
that's it so far so here is inside the
hang<00:03:26.640> time<00:03:26.910> pinball<00:03:29.420> if<00:03:30.420> you<00:03:30.600> open<00:03:30.930> it<00:03:31.019> up<00:03:31.140> here

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
hang time pinball if you open it up here

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.170 
hang time pinball if you open it up here
we've<00:03:33.900> got<00:03:34.080> all<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.290> components<00:03:35.180> power

I<00:03:57.989> just<00:03:58.170> installed<00:03:58.549> this<00:03:59.549> is<00:03:59.700> nice<00:03:59.880> I<00:04:00.150> made<00:04:00.360> it

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
I just installed this is nice I made it

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.660 
I just installed this is nice I made it
so<00:04:00.600> dogs<00:04:00.750> disconnect<00:04:01.350> so<00:04:01.530> you<00:04:01.590> can<00:04:01.799> for

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
so dogs disconnect so you can for

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.120 
so dogs disconnect so you can for
example<00:04:02.700> you<00:04:03.090> just<00:04:03.350> unplug<00:04:04.350> it's<00:04:04.769> all<00:04:05.010> the

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
example you just unplug it's all the

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.550 
example you just unplug it's all the
lights<00:04:05.280> will<00:04:05.489> be<00:04:05.579> able<00:04:05.730> to<00:04:06.170> plug<00:04:07.170> in<00:04:07.350> and<00:04:07.470> out

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
lights will be able to plug in and out

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.280 
lights will be able to plug in and out
there'll<00:04:08.220> be<00:04:08.250> more<00:04:08.489> shift<00:04:08.700> registers<00:04:09.290> when

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
there'll be more shift registers when

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.960 
there'll be more shift registers when
I'm<00:04:10.380> done<00:04:10.560> I'll<00:04:10.739> add<00:04:10.890> it<00:04:11.250> actually<00:04:11.489> before<00:04:11.579> per

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
I'm done I'll add it actually before per

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.440 
I'm done I'll add it actually before per
row<00:04:12.860> and<00:04:13.860> more<00:04:14.070> MOSFETs<00:04:14.549> and<00:04:14.700> transistors<00:04:15.299> as

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
row and more MOSFETs and transistors as

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.900 
row and more MOSFETs and transistors as
well<00:04:16.220> but<00:04:17.220> it's<00:04:17.370> all<00:04:17.430> working<00:04:17.609> through<00:04:17.820> the

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
well but it's all working through the

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.409 
well but it's all working through the
i2c<00:04:19.010> protocol<00:04:20.010> and<00:04:20.190> it's<00:04:20.280> all<00:04:20.430> work<00:04:21.269> more
