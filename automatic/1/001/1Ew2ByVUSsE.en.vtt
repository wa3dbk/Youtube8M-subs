00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
higher resolution vga screen so you can

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.609 
higher resolution vga screen so you can
fit<00:01:39.030> more<00:01:39.240> on<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.049> screenings<00:01:40.470> of

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
bit better on the x 800 because of the

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.440
