 ability to fly and generate lightning 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.780
 laser with the eyes will help us 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.940
 face our enemies up 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.710
 reach the sun by fighting against the 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.970
 enemies we are getting points of 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.860
 experience that will allow us 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.790
 unlock skills or plots to 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.790
 improve our performance 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.460
 approach reminds us of others 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.440
 fighting games previously seen 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.000
 despite this, it must be said that the 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.880
 level of detail is taken care of to the maximum 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.230
 giving the feeling of great mobility the 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.880
 way in which the elements of the 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.340
 scenario are destroyed when falling on 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.060
 they or the air fight moments are 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.060
 simply spectacular 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.050
 as we go winning 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.520
 entrepreneurs in the story mode we'll see 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.050
 sequences in which they reveal 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.460
 details about our past 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:36.010
 hero and the movie 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:42.239
 in a radius of 36 they surround the canvas 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:42.239
 days of upload now forecast starts 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.760
 we will also have a way to 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.680
 survival in which we 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.420
 we will face hordes of enemies with 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.260
 the only goal of floating until 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.260
 We are able 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.069
 ah 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.370
 the strong point of man of steel ' is without 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:10.520
 no doubt its great graphic section 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.800
 full of realism and detail for another 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.330
 part their biggest problem would be their lack 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.600
 of originality and a scanty 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.520
 replayiness we have fun with him but 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.470
 once all the adversaries have been overcome 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.050
 offers little incentive for 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.520
 we want to play again maybe I should 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.709
 sold at a lower price to 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.270
 compensate for their failures but at least it is 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.520
 a worthy adaptation of one of the 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.880
 most charismatic characters of all 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.880
 time 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.200
 ah
