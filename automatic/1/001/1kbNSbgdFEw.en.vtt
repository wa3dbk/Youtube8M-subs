00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
all ready for planting so let's put some

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.099 
all ready for planting so let's put some
seeds<00:00:10.710> in<00:00:10.889> there<00:00:13.490> okay<00:00:14.490> so<00:00:14.549> what<00:00:15.089> we<00:00:15.299> have<00:00:15.599> here

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
seeds in there okay so what we have here

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.980 
seeds in there okay so what we have here
are<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.710> couple<00:00:16.890> packages<00:00:17.520> of<00:00:17.880> seeds<00:00:18.180> made<00:00:18.720> by

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
are a couple packages of seeds made by

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.230 
are a couple packages of seeds made by
ferry<00:00:19.439> Morris<00:00:19.890> carrots<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:20.910> beets<00:00:21.000> we're

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
ferry Morris carrots and beets we're

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.420 
ferry Morris carrots and beets we're
gonna<00:00:21.330> try<00:00:21.600> planting<00:00:21.930> in<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.350> same<00:00:22.619> area<00:00:23.070> as

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
gonna try planting in the same area as

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.820 
gonna try planting in the same area as
last<00:00:23.970> year<00:00:24.390> we'll<00:00:24.930> probably<00:00:24.960> put<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.470> couple

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
last year we'll probably put a couple

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.220 
last year we'll probably put a couple
rows<00:00:26.039> of<00:00:26.279> each<00:00:26.400> in<00:00:26.670> that<00:00:26.820> area<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.720> can<00:00:28.019> put

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
rows of each in that area you can put

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.609 
rows of each in that area you can put
the<00:00:28.380> seeds<00:00:28.650> pretty<00:00:29.369> close<00:00:30.080> the<00:00:31.080> rows<00:00:31.289> pretty

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
the seeds pretty close the rows pretty

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.100 
the seeds pretty close the rows pretty
close<00:00:31.830> together<00:00:32.009> because<00:00:32.640> what<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.000> find<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.600> as

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
close together because what I find is as

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.080 
close together because what I find is as
the<00:00:34.440> plants<00:00:34.800> grow<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.160> kind<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.430> reduces<00:00:35.579> the

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
the plants grow it kind of reduces the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.090 
the plants grow it kind of reduces the
weed<00:00:36.300> growth<00:00:36.630> if<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:37.020> plant<00:00:37.260> just<00:00:37.469> grow

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
weed growth if the plant just grow

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.270 
weed growth if the plant just grow
together<00:00:38.989> if<00:00:39.989> it's<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.440> small<00:00:40.710> space<00:00:40.829> like<00:00:40.980> this

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
together if it's a small space like this

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.490 
together if it's a small space like this
you<00:00:41.850> really<00:00:42.059> don't<00:00:42.450> need<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:43.020> can<00:00:43.200> reach<00:00:43.350> from

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
you really don't need you can reach from

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.830 
you really don't need you can reach from
either<00:00:43.710> side<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.460> space<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:45.090> do<00:00:45.809> your

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
either side of the space to do your

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.360 
either side of the space to do your
weeding<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.350> picking<00:00:46.770> so<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.039> don't<00:00:47.219> need

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
weeding and picking so you don't need

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.500 
weeding and picking so you don't need
space<00:00:47.789> between<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.329> rows<00:00:48.570> for<00:00:49.379> walking<00:00:49.800> in<00:00:49.920> so

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
space between the rows for walking in so

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.700 
space between the rows for walking in so
let's<00:00:51.510> go<00:00:51.750> ahead<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:51.989> plant<00:00:52.350> some<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.559> these

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
let's go ahead and plant some of these

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.819 
let's go ahead and plant some of these
seeds<00:00:53.600> okay<00:00:54.600> so<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:55.020> planting<00:00:55.559> it's<00:00:55.680> usually

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
seeds okay so in planting it's usually

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.799 
seeds okay so in planting it's usually
good<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.610> can<00:00:56.760> look<00:00:56.879> at<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.090> instructions<00:00:57.660> on

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
good you can look at the instructions on

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.779 
good you can look at the instructions on
the<00:00:57.899> back<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.350> seeds<00:00:58.649> they<00:00:59.129> all<00:00:59.280> come<00:00:59.579> with

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
the back of the seeds they all come with

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.369 
the back of the seeds they all come with
their<00:00:59.940> own<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.270> says<00:01:00.449> days<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.930> germination

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
their own it says days to germination

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.420 
their own it says days to germination
eight<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.980> twelve<00:01:02.250> days<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.059> harvest<00:01:03.239> 75

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
eight to twelve days to harvest 75

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.010 
eight to twelve days to harvest 75
planting<00:01:05.430> depth<00:01:05.640> quarter<00:01:06.210> inch<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.600> half<00:01:06.810> inch

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
planting depth quarter inch to half inch

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.440 
planting depth quarter inch to half inch
and<00:01:07.580> spacing<00:01:08.580> rows<00:01:08.820> 15<00:01:09.810> inches<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:11.310> 2<00:01:11.850> inches

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
and spacing rows 15 inches to 2 inches

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.840 
and spacing rows 15 inches to 2 inches
okay<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.100> spacing<00:01:14.100> between<00:01:14.250> these<00:01:14.460> plants

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
okay so spacing between these plants

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.520 
okay so spacing between these plants
should<00:01:14.909> be<00:01:14.970> 2<00:01:15.210> inches<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:16.259> basically

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
should be 2 inches and this basically

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.649 
should be 2 inches and this basically
train<00:01:16.830> rows<00:01:17.100> should<00:01:17.340> be<00:01:17.430> 15<00:01:17.909> inches<00:01:18.030> will

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
train rows should be 15 inches will

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.570 
train rows should be 15 inches will
probably<00:01:19.020> do<00:01:19.110> about<00:01:19.229> 12<00:01:19.740> inches<00:01:19.920> between<00:01:20.340> rows

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
probably do about 12 inches between rows

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.210 
probably do about 12 inches between rows
and<00:01:21.020> you<00:01:22.020> can<00:01:22.170> preserve<00:01:22.350> my<00:01:22.680> storage<00:01:23.009> or

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
and you can preserve my storage or

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.030 
and you can preserve my storage or
canning<00:01:23.490> that's<00:01:23.670> for<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.850> carrots<00:01:24.259> beets<00:01:25.259> the

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
canning that's for the carrots beets the

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.280 
canning that's for the carrots beets the
depth<00:01:26.369> for<00:01:26.580> planting<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.270> actually<00:01:27.689> 1<00:01:27.960> inch<00:01:28.140> so

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
depth for planting is actually 1 inch so

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.469 
depth for planting is actually 1 inch so
it's<00:01:28.409> slightly<00:01:28.560> deeper<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.340> find<00:01:29.970> if<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.240> find

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
it's slightly deeper I find if you find

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.200 
it's slightly deeper I find if you find
everything<00:01:30.750> around<00:01:31.200> 1/2<00:01:31.619> inch<00:01:31.950> deep<00:01:32.310> to

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
everything around 1/2 inch deep to

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.350 
everything around 1/2 inch deep to
quarter<00:01:33.570> inch<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.990> grows<00:01:34.290> just<00:01:34.320> fine<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.460> what

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
quarter inch it grows just fine so what

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.060 
quarter inch it grows just fine so what
you<00:01:36.509> want<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.720> do<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.290> got<00:01:37.439> your<00:01:37.470> packages

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
you want to do is you got your packages

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.640 
you want to do is you got your packages
of<00:01:38.189> seeds<00:01:38.400> there<00:01:38.670> get<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.450> stick<00:01:39.960> some<00:01:40.320> kind<00:01:40.560> of

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
of seeds there get a stick some kind of

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.990 
of seeds there get a stick some kind of
stick<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.130> can<00:01:41.310> actually<00:01:41.670> make<00:01:41.850> your

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
stick that you can actually make your

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
stick that you can actually make your
row<00:01:42.210> nice<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.659> straight<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:44.390> get<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.689> nice

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
row nice and straight and get it a nice

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.990 
row nice and straight and get it a nice
wedge<00:01:46.350> too<00:01:46.590> nice<00:01:46.740> step<00:01:47.009> so<00:01:47.520> what<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.759> do<00:01:47.880> is

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
wedge too nice step so what you do is

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.230 
wedge too nice step so what you do is
take<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.600> edge<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.049> stick<00:01:49.320> put<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.040> in<00:01:50.240> on

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
take the edge of the stick put it in on

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.020 
take the edge of the stick put it in on
the<00:01:51.450> dirt<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.930> then<00:01:52.560> just<00:01:52.799> kind<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.130> wedge<00:01:53.850> it

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
the dirt and then just kind of wedge it

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.020 
the dirt and then just kind of wedge it
down<00:01:54.270> like<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.340> there<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.490> got<00:01:56.670> your<00:01:56.909> little

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
down like that there you got your little

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.440 
down like that there you got your little
trough<00:01:57.469> there<00:01:58.469> we<00:01:58.590> do<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.829> few<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.520> those<00:01:59.640> I<00:02:00.090> know

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
trough there we do a few of those I know

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.780 
trough there we do a few of those I know
that<00:02:00.719> looks<00:02:00.960> really<00:02:01.200> rough<00:02:01.619> estimation<00:02:02.430> of

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
that looks really rough estimation of

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.429 
that looks really rough estimation of
depth<00:02:03.030> but<00:02:03.360> really<00:02:03.750> that's<00:02:03.869> all<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.259> takes

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
depth but really that's all it takes

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.130 
depth but really that's all it takes
kind<00:02:05.130> just<00:02:05.310> spread<00:02:05.670> out<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.969> seeds<00:02:06.240> long<00:02:06.570> the

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
kind just spread out the seeds long the

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.160 
kind just spread out the seeds long the
weight<00:02:07.520> carrot<00:02:08.550> there'll<00:02:09.179> be<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.330> ton<00:02:09.629> of<00:02:09.660> seeds

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
weight carrot there'll be a ton of seeds

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.940 
weight carrot there'll be a ton of seeds
this<00:02:10.259> package<00:02:10.740> so<00:02:11.370> if<00:02:11.819> I<00:02:11.970> open<00:02:12.120> it<00:02:12.390> up<00:02:12.920> kind<00:02:13.920> of

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
this package so if I open it up kind of

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.510 
this package so if I open it up kind of
just<00:02:14.160> dump<00:02:14.430> out<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:14.640> handful<00:02:15.150> of<00:02:15.180> seeds<00:02:15.599> here

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
just dump out a handful of seeds here

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.339 
just dump out a handful of seeds here
you'll<00:02:17.520> see<00:02:17.730> whole<00:02:18.239> bunch<00:02:18.599> of<00:02:18.750> seeds<00:02:19.020> right

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
you'll see whole bunch of seeds right

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.070 
you'll see whole bunch of seeds right
there<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:20.970> then<00:02:21.180> I<00:02:21.300> kind<00:02:21.540> of<00:02:21.569> just<00:02:21.750> slowly

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
there and then I kind of just slowly

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.430 
there and then I kind of just slowly
sprinkle<00:02:22.680> them<00:02:22.830> as<00:02:23.280> I<00:02:23.459> go<00:02:23.640> down<00:02:23.849> the<00:02:24.060> rows<00:02:24.440> so

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
sprinkle them as I go down the rows so

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.210 
sprinkle them as I go down the rows so
just<00:02:25.680> kind<00:02:25.890> of<00:02:25.950> sprinkle<00:02:26.459> them<00:02:27.830> you<00:02:28.830> just<00:02:29.010> let

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
just kind of sprinkle them you just let

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.530 
just kind of sprinkle them you just let
them<00:02:29.310> fall<00:02:29.550> through<00:02:29.819> your<00:02:29.910> hands

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
them fall through your hands

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:40.809 
them fall through your hands
I<00:02:33.200> mean<00:02:34.200> back<00:02:34.500> down<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.130> other<00:02:35.250> way<00:02:35.459> now

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.670 

they're<00:02:41.819> gonna<00:02:41.940> grow<00:02:42.390> really<00:02:42.870> thick<00:02:43.350> so<00:02:43.620> you

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
they're gonna grow really thick so you

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.130 
they're gonna grow really thick so you
kind<00:02:44.040> of<00:02:44.100> have<00:02:44.250> to<00:02:44.280> thin<00:02:45.120> about<00:02:45.269> when<00:02:45.750> they're

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
kind of have to thin about when they're

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.199 
kind of have to thin about when they're
getting<00:02:49.430> growing<00:02:50.430> a<00:02:50.549> little<00:02:50.760> bit<00:02:50.880> so<00:02:51.060> this

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
getting growing a little bit so this

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.270 
getting growing a little bit so this
they<00:02:51.360> actually<00:02:51.690> get<00:02:51.840> to<00:02:52.019> a<00:02:52.049> sizable<00:02:52.530> size<00:02:52.739> if

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
they actually get to a sizable size if

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.120 
they actually get to a sizable size if
they're<00:02:53.489> too<00:02:53.700> close<00:02:54.140> they'll<00:02:55.140> just<00:02:55.500> be<00:02:55.799> really

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
they're too close they'll just be really

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.680 
they're too close they'll just be really
small<00:02:56.400> carrots<00:02:56.819> and<00:02:57.000> you<00:02:57.090> won't<00:02:57.299> be<00:02:57.480> able<00:02:57.569> to

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
small carrots and you won't be able to

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.470 
small carrots and you won't be able to
use<00:02:57.810> them<00:02:57.959> for<00:02:58.080> much<00:02:58.640> and<00:02:59.640> your<00:02:59.819> beets<00:03:00.060> they're

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
use them for much and your beets they're

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.240 
use them for much and your beets they're
bigger<00:03:00.750> seeds<00:03:01.140> so<00:03:01.350> you<00:03:01.380> can<00:03:01.500> almost<00:03:01.799> plant

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
bigger seeds so you can almost plant

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.360 
bigger seeds so you can almost plant
them<00:03:02.519> one<00:03:03.390> at<00:03:03.540> a<00:03:03.630> time<00:03:03.660> or<00:03:04.500> you<00:03:04.709> can<00:03:04.739> still<00:03:05.100> kind

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
them one at a time or you can still kind

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.390 
them one at a time or you can still kind
of<00:03:05.400> just<00:03:05.610> spread<00:03:05.790> them<00:03:06.030> out<00:03:06.180> evenly<00:03:07.069> as<00:03:08.069> I<00:03:08.220> did

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
of just spread them out evenly as I did

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.100 
of just spread them out evenly as I did
so<00:03:08.640> that's<00:03:09.450> what<00:03:09.600> I'll<00:03:09.690> do

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
so that's what I'll do

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.220 
so that's what I'll do
this<00:03:10.410> one<00:03:10.560> actually<00:03:10.739> says<00:03:11.130> spacing<00:03:11.880> between

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
this one actually says spacing between

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.140 
this one actually says spacing between
plants<00:03:13.230> is<00:03:13.380> four<00:03:13.650> inches<00:03:13.799> so<00:03:14.220> you<00:03:14.730> can<00:03:14.790> start

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
plants is four inches so you can start

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.420 
plants is four inches so you can start
them<00:03:15.359> out<00:03:15.480> at<00:03:15.690> about<00:03:15.780> two<00:03:16.200> inch<00:03:16.440> one<00:03:17.250> and<00:03:17.400> a

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
them out at about two inch one and a

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.880 
them out at about two inch one and a
half<00:03:17.549> inch<00:03:17.820> space<00:03:18.090> and<00:03:18.420> as<00:03:18.840> they<00:03:19.019> pop<00:03:19.290> up<00:03:19.320> you

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
half inch space and as they pop up you

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.039 
half inch space and as they pop up you
can<00:03:20.070> thin<00:03:20.220> them<00:03:20.310> out<00:03:20.430> for<00:03:20.670> salad<00:03:21.060> greens<00:03:21.329> or<00:03:21.870> do

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
can thin them out for salad greens or do

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.390 
can thin them out for salad greens or do
whatever<00:03:22.200> you<00:03:22.440> want<00:03:22.650> so<00:03:22.859> I'm<00:03:22.920> gonna<00:03:23.070> go<00:03:23.280> ahead

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
whatever you want so I'm gonna go ahead

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.380 
whatever you want so I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:03:23.730> lay<00:03:24.180> those<00:03:24.359> down<00:03:24.420> right<00:03:24.690> now<00:03:26.120> now<00:03:27.120> that<00:03:27.329> we

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
and lay those down right now now that we

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.120 
and lay those down right now now that we
got<00:03:27.510> all<00:03:27.570> the<00:03:27.870> rows<00:03:28.019> of<00:03:28.230> planted<00:03:28.709> all<00:03:28.829> you<00:03:28.980> need

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
got all the rows of planted all you need

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.340 
got all the rows of planted all you need
to<00:03:29.250> do<00:03:29.400> is<00:03:29.549> cover<00:03:30.030> them<00:03:30.299> up<00:03:30.450> gently<00:03:30.870> with<00:03:31.019> soil

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
to do is cover them up gently with soil

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.479 
to do is cover them up gently with soil
and<00:03:32.180> water<00:03:33.180> so<00:03:33.750> that's<00:03:33.930> all<00:03:34.109> I'll<00:03:34.200> do<00:03:34.380> now<00:03:34.560> just

and water so that's all I'll do now just
kind<00:03:35.700> of<00:03:35.880> pull<00:03:36.299> the<00:03:36.450> dirt<00:03:36.660> in<00:03:36.840> from<00:03:37.049> both<00:03:37.200> sides

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
kind of pull the dirt in from both sides

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.710 
kind of pull the dirt in from both sides

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
both sides covering up the seeds well

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.930 
both sides covering up the seeds well
there's<00:03:43.440> any<00:03:43.620> clumps<00:03:44.010> of<00:03:44.160> dirt<00:03:44.340> kind<00:03:44.670> of<00:03:44.760> break

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
there's any clumps of dirt kind of break

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.030 
there's any clumps of dirt kind of break
it<00:03:44.970> up<00:03:45.239> further<00:03:45.450> wise<00:03:45.630> the<00:03:45.780> seeds<00:03:46.019> won't<00:03:46.290> grow

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
it up further wise the seeds won't grow

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.770 
it up further wise the seeds won't grow
very<00:03:47.340> nicely<00:03:48.709> cover<00:03:49.709> up<00:03:50.390> you<00:03:51.390> got<00:03:51.570> them<00:03:51.690> all

what happens in a few days I'll show you
the<00:03:59.100> update<00:04:00.799> so<00:04:01.799> I<00:04:01.829> actually<00:04:01.980> have<00:04:02.370> a

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
the update so I actually have a

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.240 
the update so I actually have a
sprinkling<00:04:04.170> system<00:04:04.380> that<00:04:04.769> waters<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.160> whole

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
sprinkling system that waters the whole

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.460 
sprinkling system that waters the whole
garden<00:04:05.730> when<00:04:06.239> the<00:04:06.359> seeds<00:04:06.600> are<00:04:06.750> brand-new<00:04:07.260> I

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
garden when the seeds are brand-new I
