00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
like Ric Flair in the main event you're

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.660 
like Ric Flair in the main event you're
thinking<00:02:21.840> of<00:02:21.900> Ric<00:02:22.110> Flair<00:02:22.350> from<00:02:23.040> 20<00:02:23.370> years<00:02:23.550> ago

thinking of Ric Flair from 20 years ago

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.100 
thinking of Ric Flair from 20 years ago
as<00:02:23.910> that<00:02:24.090> is<00:02:24.180> show<00:02:24.330> up<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:24.630> you<00:02:24.750> think<00:02:24.990> that

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
as that is show up and you think that

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.780 
as that is show up and you think that
you<00:02:25.380> know<00:02:25.470> he's<00:02:26.010> really<00:02:26.190> to<00:02:26.400> go<00:02:26.520> out<00:02:26.640> and

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
you know he's really to go out and

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.340 
you know he's really to go out and
perform<00:02:26.970> to<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:27.390> fullest<00:02:27.750> but<00:02:27.930> I<00:02:27.990> think<00:02:28.200> if

perform to the fullest but I think if

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.540 
perform to the fullest but I think if
you<00:02:28.440> do<00:02:28.620> that<00:02:28.800> you're<00:02:29.010> going<00:02:29.100> to<00:02:29.160> end<00:02:29.340> up<00:02:29.490> with

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
you do that you're going to end up with

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.240 
you do that you're going to end up with
a<00:02:29.730> match<00:02:29.970> that's<00:02:30.240> more<00:02:30.420> like<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:31.680> end<00:02:31.890> of<00:02:32.070> the

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.830 
way out the door and I honestly think
that<00:03:05.070> the<00:03:05.220> match<00:03:05.400> is<00:03:05.580> bad<00:03:05.760> i<00:03:05.790> think<00:03:06.210> that<00:03:06.360> it<00:03:06.630> is

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
that the match is bad i think that it is

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.300 
that the match is bad i think that it is
being<00:03:07.200> placed<00:03:07.530> on<00:03:07.770> the<00:03:07.950> best<00:03:08.490> of<00:03:08.670> WCW<00:03:09.330> nitro

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
being placed on the best of WCW nitro

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.680 
being placed on the best of WCW nitro
DVD<00:03:11.310> that<00:03:11.400> is<00:03:11.550> coming<00:03:11.790> out<00:03:11.940> and<00:03:12.000> i<00:03:12.450> honestly

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
DVD that is coming out and i honestly

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:13.790 
DVD that is coming out and i honestly
don't<00:03:13.050> think<00:03:13.080> it<00:03:13.260> should<00:03:13.290> be<00:03:13.440> there<00:03:13.650> i<00:03:13.710> think

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
don't think it should be there i think

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.170 
don't think it should be there i think
that<00:03:14.010> they're<00:03:14.160> taking<00:03:14.520> away<00:03:14.610> from<00:03:14.760> something

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
that they're taking away from something

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.820 
that they're taking away from something
else<00:03:15.420> that<00:03:15.630> could<00:03:15.750> have<00:03:15.870> been<00:03:15.990> there<00:03:16.170> but<00:03:16.380> it

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
else that could have been there but it

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.530 
else that could have been there but it
is<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.280> last<00:03:17.490> match<00:03:17.790> tonight<00:03:18.120> show<00:03:18.330> so<00:03:18.510> i

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
is the last match tonight show so i

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.080 
is the last match tonight show so i
think<00:03:18.810> it<00:03:18.930> does<00:03:19.160> deserve<00:03:20.160> its<00:03:20.430> place<00:03:20.670> on<00:03:20.880> there

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
think it does deserve its place on there

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.150 
think it does deserve its place on there
for<00:03:21.300> some<00:03:21.480> reason<00:03:21.930> it<00:03:22.110> is<00:03:22.410> much<00:03:22.770> better<00:03:22.800> than

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
for some reason it is much better than

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.730 
for some reason it is much better than
the<00:03:23.810> Booker<00:03:24.810> T<00:03:24.960> ver<00:03:25.170> Scott<00:03:25.440> Steiner

out those matches those matches are

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.240 
out those matches those matches are
better<00:03:42.390> but<00:03:42.600> then<00:03:42.810> to<00:03:43.560> top<00:03:43.770> it<00:03:43.800> off<00:03:44.040> I<00:03:44.190> guess

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250
