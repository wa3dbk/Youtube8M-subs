00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
yeah and it's not nothing real big about

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.210 
yeah and it's not nothing real big about
that<00:04:00.480> you<00:04:00.870> know<00:04:00.989> standard<00:04:01.350> stuff<00:04:01.769> it's<00:04:02.040> old

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
and then we have the newest one that

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.930 
and then we have the newest one that
they<00:04:04.709> have<00:04:04.800> come<00:04:04.920> out<00:04:05.070> with<00:04:05.220> which<00:04:05.459> is<00:04:05.640> the
