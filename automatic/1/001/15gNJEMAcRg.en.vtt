00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 there are also teams instead of 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.490
 they could really take advantage of it 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.379
 light of the results of the others is 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.980
 speaking of the europa league claims of the 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.960
 1900 issue one thousand and one thing a lot 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.949
 interesting if you do n't have Gallians 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.920
 that is all to see because in short 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.619
 seedorf has made a good gear more 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.170
 important because I believe this is it 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.599
 the starting point to build the 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.000
 but the near future we give could 6 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.619
 present with the formations that the 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.860
 regards the item is great expectation 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.450
 the words of poe count in the post game 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.520
 maybe they will help to clarify 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.070
 at this point what will be its future 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.469
 yesterday in the conference prepartita 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.480
 press has not spoken in the discard 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.649
 talked is moved into feeling 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.719
 because what he told us 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.680
 on this beppe marotta the second and with the 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.600
 maximum 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.030
 I think that after these three years 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.940
 extraordinary the fantastic record no 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.059
 suffering today we forget why there 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.250
 distracting we already know everything lucas with the 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.990
 Polish who has already played in the cup 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.850
 Italy debuts in the league and is 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.710
 doing great security well beyond 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.970
 with he had to make extremely difficult parades 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.350
 however it is showing good qualities and a lot 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.720
 sure this demonstration of the 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.540
 fun game but also little like it 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.560
 we say tactically neat we will 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.509
 we refer to the Olympic field with 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.020
 companoni and beppe bergomi for the 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.929
 second 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.939
 but of course we meet again here for the 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:36.229
 final of this day with all the 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.229
 protagonists of the day 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.920
 there was a balloon also direct dots 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.509
 protagonist as we like to do though 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.909
 we are talking in terms of proof 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.960
 television or not because first in the case 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.200
 right the prosthesis would never be 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.049
 applied 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.270
 no on an occasion when you understand 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:58.330
 that the referee saw something risk 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.679
 something to be right on the other hand is the 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.240
 case of asking this because it was 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:03.490
 TV test applied 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.990
 being at all evenings and we are 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:10.000
 we will say in real time of course 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:13.030
 then we will soon go to ours 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.690
 aspect plays a success so much but first 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:20.049
 let's move on to antonio conte we return to 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.900
 a couple here is how they are used 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:26.860
 even the cameras in the locker room 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:30.099
 exclusive of sky 9 also tell of gods 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.030
 moments when you can do it 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:36.040
 compliments for the beautiful moments of the 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:40.890
 performance in football also perfect 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.890
 in the whole had a very brief pause 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.330
 a lot including the losers or data 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.860
 on the race totally having for 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.220
 the last useful place for now 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.220
 but there
