00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:14.990
 It is a story of a man who got to know on the Internet 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:17.920
 One time I was chatting with him so I didn't feel very well , so what did I do? 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.640
 I had it 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.850
 Then 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.039
 That there was something strange 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:31.000
 you 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:35.860
 The beginning of things is that where he moved to the house where he lives now ? 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.070
 A well mean he began living alone from getting to society 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:45.700
 It was not a Abba studio 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:47.970
 But it began funny thing was out in less than a month from becoming come he 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.970
 Seems 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:58.520
 He seems to have been a rude character in the future , and he wanted to find something in the future 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:01:02.130
 Dattari glasses or was even, for example, pen when you are in the house 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:07.050
 Wonder if the scissors were where did not ballet novel 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:09.370
 Dvd I borrowed from a friend Where did I go? 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:14.340
 I will put it 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.340
 Well That's right time was also a wind say so are looking for 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:23.450
 Because there was a business to go out on Sunday that day 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:29.659
 I was looking for a house key but I can not find it 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:36.530
 I wonder if it was in the back because it was funny when I came home yesterday 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:40.440
 The other while it is Uosao and the like Naa It looked jacket pocket a little while ago in the rain 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.000
 It was not possible to make it in time to leave the house 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:49.190
 I bought this 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:53.650
 So promised that the I wonder if that guy I tell you that a little late when he opens a mobile phone 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.650
 It sounded like a Japanese 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.630
 Looking back 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:02.270
 Many times 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.270
 The key of the house is falling on the floor 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:14.250
 At that time he was suddenly more alone in the room than he found the key 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.520
 And sound like slam and the key fell 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.600
 I found the key 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:23.980
 I will remember cold 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.960
 Moreover, the volume of the sound is quite high 1 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.390
 Maybe from the ceiling 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.200
 Only if it fell 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.200
 I so did not seem 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:41.060
 Sometime after that there was such a thing 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:44.120
 For example, when you are looking for a wallet from the purse per ceiling 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:51.129
 It seems to come to the Botton 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:51.129
 If you think Naa there is no cellophane tape cellophane tape Poto' and earth 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:03:03.849
 Well, something like this happened on a page once every few weeks 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.849
 Well in some poltergeist state 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:10.540
 He's lost, he's a landlord's room 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:14.610
 It seems that I asked the landlord about the room 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:18.720
 Funny something like goby that room 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:24.990
 But Otani's is not unwillingly unwillingly way ... 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:27.180
 Something strange has never happened, and the previous tenant lived for many years, but something happened 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.090
 Naa because there was no 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.610
 1 point Marie 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:38.310
 Especially he who gives up without help 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:39.270
 The strange phenomenon beyond finding things to look for does not happen, so I can not help but the porter exterior 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.770
 However 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.880
 And Na Ne only go dating 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.880
 Seems to be angry 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:52.870
 And it's been about a year since I just lived in the house 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:59.290
 Well he 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:04.120
 It seems to have entered a camp on an employee trip in summer 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:11.580
 Well he belonged to a venture company with few employees 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:14.030
 So let 's set up a tent at a campsite on the edge to see if it is in the valley and make a full- scale camp 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.030
 It seems to have done 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:21.620
 We all celebrate on the inspection site and enjoy flowers so much 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:25.720
 When the Well is or to prepare for cooking utensils or tents 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.720
 I do not have one of my coworkers 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:33.990
 Though I thought it was strange 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.990
 At first some sort of machine very much 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:41.210
 I wonder if it entered 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:44.770
 That's right I thought why was worrisome Mushoni also 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:49.670
 And Naa go in search of Katane 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:53.000
 Well, it 's on the downstream side of the river that seems to be heading for the time being 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:56.070
 Toward the campground of the control room 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.070
 I walked with Pochi Pochi 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:02.520
 While he is entering walking in the mix or the 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.520
 Coton 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.800
 Say 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.849
 Heavy things 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.849
 It became a Ochiro 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.139
 I wonder why he 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.540
 7 degrees 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:20.140
 Etc. look back 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.140
 There 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.120
 Chinami 0 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:29.240
 Falling 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.240
 There was a colleague I was looking for 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:39.770
 The place seems to have been very much after that as abuzz 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:44.080
 As a result, the cause of death in the instant death are colleagues 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.080
 Seems to have fallen from the top of the cliff 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:56.190
 Colleagues is a dare dangerous Apparently According to the police the police 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:06:01.710
 It seems to have climbed a steep cliff and the reason is unclear after all 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:05.300
 I do not know well , but it seems that it is not possible to do it anyway , so it is an accident with ambiguity 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.300
 The goal being processed 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:16.330
 It's why I was Well it is an accident does de heard the story so far 

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:18.820
 I think it has nothing to do with the previous Poltergeist experienced 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.220
 Encouraged him 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.550
 But he 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.550
 No 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.419
 I am 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.419
 Naa'm've heard 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.569
 That 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.960
 That is 

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:36.590
 I fell from a cliff 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.590
 Behind me 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.650
 I leave ossa 

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.730
 Now to the right of capital 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:48.440
 GOOD FOR YOU 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:51.000
 Say 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:53.900
 Without intonation 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.900
 Good girl 

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.120
 Saying so 

00:06:57.129 --> 00:07:01.360
 He 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.360
 Shut up 

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:10.640
 This is the story I asked him 

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:16.990
 What 's Kana then that he eventually 

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:16.990
 I don't know what happened because I have lost communication 

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.810
 Even now 

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:25.370
 What he is looking for 

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:25.370
 Will it fall from above
