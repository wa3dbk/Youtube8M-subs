at is different classes i said i was
going<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.250> do<00:00:20.400> this<00:00:20.580> so<00:00:20.939> i<00:00:21.179> figured<00:00:21.539> i<00:00:21.570> should

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:21.599 
going to do this so i figured i should

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:23.779 
going to do this so i figured i should
get<00:00:21.839> on<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.109> so<00:00:23.099> basically<00:00:23.460> what<00:00:23.609> we're<00:00:23.759> doing

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
get on it so basically what we're doing

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.359 
get on it so basically what we're doing
is<00:00:24.210> we<00:00:24.779> are<00:00:24.810> going<00:00:25.259> to<00:00:25.349> look<00:00:25.529> specifically<00:00:26.249> at

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
is we are going to look specifically at

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.239 
is we are going to look specifically at
the<00:00:26.999> beginning<00:00:27.570> this<00:00:28.109> beginning<00:00:28.769> segment

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:29.249 
the beginning this beginning segment

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:31.810 
the beginning this beginning segment
here<00:00:29.429> with<00:00:29.579> each<00:00:29.789> class<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:30.480> is<00:00:30.869> because

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
here with each class and that is because

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.490 
here with each class and that is because
we<00:00:32.820> get<00:00:33.060> abilities<00:00:33.870> abilities<00:00:34.640> that<00:00:35.640> we<00:00:36.410> so<00:00:37.410> we

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
we get abilities abilities that we so we

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.500 
we get abilities abilities that we so we
can<00:00:37.620> kind<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.920> see<00:00:38.160> what<00:00:38.430> our<00:00:38.850> characters<00:00:39.300> will

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
can kind of see what our characters will

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.930 
can kind of see what our characters will
look<00:00:40.140> like<00:00:40.380> or<00:00:40.710> not<00:00:41.100> look<00:00:41.310> like<00:00:41.460> just<00:00:41.730> like

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
look like or not look like just like

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.190 
look like or not look like just like
play<00:00:42.210> like<00:00:42.240> in<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:43.440> later<00:00:43.680> parts<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.190> game

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
play like in the later parts of the game

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.370 
play like in the later parts of the game
so<00:00:46.200> let's<00:00:46.410> go<00:00:46.560> until<00:00:46.890> we<00:00:46.980> get<00:00:47.100> an<00:00:47.190> ability

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:48.380 
so let's go until we get an ability

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.840 
so let's go until we get an ability
which<00:00:49.380> would<00:00:49.500> be<00:00:49.590> any<00:00:49.770> second<00:00:50.250> now<00:00:50.280> this<00:00:50.700> is

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
which would be any second now this is

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.110 
which would be any second now this is
just<00:00:51.030> normal<00:00:51.300> text<00:00:52.020> for<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.680> rope<00:00:53.000> alright<00:00:54.000> so

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
just normal text for the rope alright so

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.370 
just normal text for the rope alright so
here's<00:00:54.360> our<00:00:54.480> first<00:00:54.660> ability<00:00:54.960> we<00:00:55.230> have

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.380 
here's our first ability we have

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.070 
here's our first ability we have
backstab<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.790> backstab<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.780> a

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.080 
backstab so backstab is a

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.580 
backstab so backstab is a
lightning-quick<00:00:58.680> rogue<00:00:59.460> vanishes<00:01:00.590> polite

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
lightning-quick rogue vanishes polite

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.820 
lightning-quick rogue vanishes polite
and<00:01:01.770> quick<00:01:02.240> rogue<00:01:03.240> vanishes<00:01:03.870> in<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.379> smoke

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
and quick rogue vanishes in a smoke

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.680 
and quick rogue vanishes in a smoke
screen<00:01:04.980> and<00:01:05.309> reappears<00:01:05.940> so<00:01:06.180> it's<00:01:06.360> just<00:01:06.600> a

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
screen and reappears so it's just a

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.160 
screen and reappears so it's just a
blink<00:01:06.960> strike<00:01:07.380> basically<00:01:07.980> and<00:01:08.240> we<00:01:09.240> can<00:01:09.450> use<00:01:10.140> it

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
blink strike basically and we can use it

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.710 
blink strike basically and we can use it
on<00:01:10.470> this<00:01:10.710> guy<00:01:10.950> here<00:01:11.370> let's<00:01:11.730> say<00:01:11.940> and<00:01:12.630> it

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
on this guy here let's say and it

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.900 
on this guy here let's say and it
usually<00:01:12.900> just<00:01:13.320> doesn't<00:01:14.310> insane<00:01:14.640> amount<00:01:14.880> of

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910 
usually just doesn't insane amount of

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.770 
usually just doesn't insane amount of
damage<00:01:15.440> now<00:01:16.440> i'm<00:01:16.530> not<00:01:16.560> sure<00:01:16.860> i<00:01:17.240> guess<00:01:18.240> if<00:01:18.450> ropes

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
damage now i'm not sure i guess if ropes

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.390 
damage now i'm not sure i guess if ropes
do<00:01:19.200> more<00:01:19.409> damage<00:01:19.560> from<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.890> bag<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.250> looks

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
do more damage from the bag it looks

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.550 
do more damage from the bag it looks
kind<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.640> like<00:01:20.700> they<00:01:20.970> might<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.450> mean<00:01:22.380> that

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
kind of like they might I mean that

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.600 
kind of like they might I mean that
would<00:01:22.650> make<00:01:22.800> the<00:01:22.890> most<00:01:22.920> sense<00:01:23.130> because<00:01:23.520> they

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
would make the most sense because they

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.830 
would make the most sense because they
did<00:01:23.760> that<00:01:23.880> in<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.030> first<00:01:24.300> game<00:01:24.480> the<00:01:24.720> whole

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
did that in the first game the whole

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.780 
did that in the first game the whole
plan<00:01:25.050> was<00:01:25.200> positioning<00:01:25.860> his<00:01:26.460> name

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
plan was positioning his name

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.250 
plan was positioning his name
positioning<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:28.320> game<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:29.780> yeah<00:01:30.780> okay<00:01:31.110> we

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
positioning that game so yeah okay we

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.840 
positioning that game so yeah okay we
got<00:01:31.380> our<00:01:31.500> second<00:01:31.740> ability<00:01:31.920> here<00:01:32.280> let's<00:01:32.520> get

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
got our second ability here let's get

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.940 
got our second ability here let's get
some<00:01:33.060> guys<00:01:33.390> grouped<00:01:33.840> up<00:01:34.050> because<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.770> the

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
some guys grouped up because this is the

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.080 
some guys grouped up because this is the
miasmic<00:01:35.490> flask<00:01:35.940> and<00:01:36.270> this<00:01:37.159> is<00:01:38.159> like<00:01:38.580> a<00:01:38.670> stunt

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
miasmic flask and this is like a stunt

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.130 
miasmic flask and this is like a stunt
basically<00:01:40.020> an<00:01:40.229> AoE<00:01:40.590> stun<00:01:41.270> so<00:01:42.270> here<00:01:42.690> we<00:01:42.750> go<00:01:42.930> with

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
guys right now it gives you kind of like

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.120 
guys right now it gives you kind of like
a<00:04:40.310> basic<00:04:41.120> rogue<00:04:41.600> play<00:04:41.900> style<00:04:42.229> I<00:04:42.380> guess<00:04:42.590> you

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
a basic rogue play style I guess you

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:51.400 
a basic rogue play style I guess you
could<00:04:43.190> say<00:04:46.930> and<00:04:49.090> out<00:04:50.090> of<00:04:50.360> the<00:04:50.479> other<00:04:50.690> classes<00:04:51.290> I

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
could say and out of the other classes I

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.040 
could say and out of the other classes I
think<00:04:51.740> I<00:04:51.830> like<00:04:52.220> this<00:04:52.550> this<00:04:53.210> one<00:04:53.479> not<00:04:53.660> the<00:04:53.840> most

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
think I like this this one not the most

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.020 
think I like this this one not the most
but<00:04:54.470> it's<00:04:54.979> definitely<00:04:55.250> up<00:04:55.580> there<00:04:55.610> I<00:04:55.880> think

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
but it's definitely up there I think

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.850 
but it's definitely up there I think
lawyer<00:04:56.510> is<00:04:56.750> probably<00:04:57.199> going<00:04:57.560> to<00:04:57.650> be<00:04:57.740> the

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
lawyer is probably going to be the

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.010 
lawyer is probably going to be the
hardest<00:04:58.160> to<00:04:58.430> get<00:04:58.550> into<00:04:58.880> solely<00:04:59.270> because<00:04:59.540> it

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
hardest to get into solely because it

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.500 
hardest to get into solely because it
has<00:05:00.199> a<00:05:00.229> lack<00:05:00.620> of<00:05:00.699> fun<00:05:01.699> moves<00:05:02.060> in<00:05:02.270> the<00:05:02.360> beginning

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
has a lack of fun moves in the beginning

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.090 
has a lack of fun moves in the beginning
and<00:05:02.870> especially<00:05:03.139> depending<00:05:03.620> on<00:05:03.919> the<00:05:03.979> way

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
and especially depending on the way

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.150 
and especially depending on the way
you're<00:05:04.250> building<00:05:04.639> them<00:05:04.729> so<00:05:05.479> I<00:05:06.070> don't<00:05:07.070> know

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
you're building them so I don't know

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.060 
you're building them so I don't know
that's<00:05:07.460> just<00:05:07.550> me<00:05:07.789> though<00:05:08.410> machen<00:05:09.410> definitely

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
that's just me though machen definitely

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:15.670 
that's just me though machen definitely
seems<00:05:10.280> like<00:05:10.550> the<00:05:10.930> best<00:05:11.930> bet<00:05:12.169> for<00:05:12.669> fun<00:05:14.680> slowly

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
seems like the best bet for fun slowly

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.140 
seems like the best bet for fun slowly
because<00:05:16.070> you<00:05:16.250> just<00:05:16.400> get<00:05:16.610> like<00:05:16.820> some

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
because you just get like some

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.370 
because you just get like some
ridiculous<00:05:17.690> moves<00:05:18.490> it's<00:05:19.490> pretty<00:05:20.150> cool<00:05:20.330> and<00:05:21.289> I

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
ridiculous moves it's pretty cool and I

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.820 
ridiculous moves it's pretty cool and I
found<00:05:21.530> that<00:05:21.770> our<00:05:22.190> I<00:05:22.250> find<00:05:22.669> that<00:05:22.789> in<00:05:23.000> dragon<00:05:23.449> age

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
found that our I find that in dragon age

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.890 
found that our I find that in dragon age
using<00:05:24.830> a<00:05:25.310> mage<00:05:26.300> is<00:05:26.690> always<00:05:27.350> going<00:05:27.530> to<00:05:27.710> be<00:05:27.740> our

you're always going to be with wanting a

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:32.920 
you're always going to be with wanting a
controlled<00:05:31.340> image<00:05:31.610> because<00:05:32.000> it<00:05:32.270> is<00:05:32.419> like<00:05:32.690> the

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
controlled image because it is like the

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.129 
controlled image because it is like the
weakest<00:05:33.410> weakest<00:05:34.370> thing<00:05:34.460> you<00:05:34.729> have<00:05:34.940> and<00:05:35.270> needs

again<00:05:58.330> it<00:05:58.510> is<00:05:58.540> easy<00:05:58.900> to<00:05:59.020> dodge<00:05:59.320> moves<00:05:59.860> that

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
again it is easy to dodge moves that

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.850 
again it is easy to dodge moves that
have<00:06:00.310> tells<00:06:01.380> except<00:06:02.380> for<00:06:02.560> if<00:06:02.620> you're<00:06:02.740> not

paying attention and talking so so I'm

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.090 
paying attention and talking so so I'm
just<00:06:06.490> saying<00:06:06.760> mouth<00:06:07.530> it<00:06:08.530> looks<00:06:08.740> like<00:06:08.770> I<00:06:08.949> could

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:09.100 
just saying mouth it looks like I could

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:14.550 
just saying mouth it looks like I could
even<00:06:09.250> like<00:06:09.520> dodge<00:06:09.910> moves<00:06:10.860> and<00:06:11.860> like<00:06:12.780> just<00:06:13.780> get

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 
even like dodge moves and like just get

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:28.480 
even like dodge moves and like just get
out<00:06:14.710> of<00:06:14.770> the<00:06:14.830> way<00:06:14.949> using<00:06:15.190> the<00:06:15.780> backstab<00:06:16.780> vanish

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:28.490 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:48.519 

no<00:06:29.120> I<00:06:29.150> even<00:06:29.960> see<00:06:30.169> that

00:06:48.519 --> 00:06:48.529 

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:50.979 

so<00:06:49.129> this<00:06:49.219> is<00:06:49.309> kind<00:06:49.519> of<00:06:49.579> like<00:06:49.699> a<00:06:49.759> basic<00:06:50.179> thing

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:50.989 
so this is kind of like a basic thing

00:06:50.989 --> 00:06:52.539 
so this is kind of like a basic thing
that<00:06:51.139> you<00:06:51.229> might<00:06:51.379> do<00:06:51.559> with<00:06:51.769> bosses<00:06:52.219> is<00:06:52.369> just

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:52.549 
that you might do with bosses is just

00:06:52.549 --> 00:06:55.409 
that you might do with bosses is just
kind<00:06:52.759> of<00:06:52.819> like<00:06:52.999> dance<00:06:53.359> around<00:06:53.749> them<00:06:54.019> like<00:06:54.199> this

00:06:55.409 --> 00:06:55.419 
kind of like dance around them like this

00:06:55.419 --> 00:07:00.249 
kind of like dance around them like this
then<00:06:56.419> when<00:06:56.539> they<00:06:56.689> get<00:06:56.899> free<00:06:57.259> of<00:06:57.639> anything<00:06:59.259> you

00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:00.259 
then when they get free of anything you

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:06.729 
then when they get free of anything you
stun<00:07:00.799> them<00:07:04.209> then<00:07:05.209> go<00:07:05.299> back<00:07:05.479> and<00:07:05.809> then<00:07:05.989> build<00:07:06.619> up

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:06.739 
stun them then go back and then build up
