Wilkinson Kehoe asked how do you avoid

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.800 
Wilkinson Kehoe asked how do you avoid
peaking<00:00:15.719> too<00:00:15.960> early<00:00:16.350> for<00:00:17.270> for<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.300> meet<00:00:18.510> Eric

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
peaking too early for for a meet Eric

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.750 
peaking too early for for a meet Eric
contest<00:00:21.199> yeah<00:00:22.199> it's<00:00:22.619> it's<00:00:23.010> gonna<00:00:23.160> be<00:00:23.340> based<00:00:23.550> on

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
contest yeah it's it's gonna be based on

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.240 
contest yeah it's it's gonna be based on
on<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.269> individual<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.439> large<00:00:25.680> degree<00:00:25.859> in

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
on the individual to a large degree in

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.560 
on the individual to a large degree in
their<00:00:26.400> training<00:00:26.699> history<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.269> their<00:00:27.359> fitness

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
their training history and their fitness

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.960 
their training history and their fitness
levels<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.199> strength<00:00:28.439> levels<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.160> so

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
levels and strength levels and and so

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.150 
levels and strength levels and and so
many<00:00:30.150> things<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.539> take<00:00:30.660> into<00:00:30.869> account<00:00:31.199> as<00:00:31.949> far

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
many things to take into account as far

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.580 
many things to take into account as far
as<00:00:32.250> not<00:00:32.610> peaking<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.630> earlier<00:00:33.930> or<00:00:34.290> being<00:00:34.500> able

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
as not peaking to earlier or being able

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.610 
as not peaking to earlier or being able
to<00:00:34.710> peak<00:00:34.890> on<00:00:35.040> time

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
to peak on time

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.229 
to peak on time
so<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:38.070> know<00:00:38.160> once<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.430> consider<00:00:38.850> those

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
so you know once you consider those

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.450 
so you know once you consider those
factors<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:39.780> let<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.649> higher<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.340> higher

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
factors that let the higher the higher

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.790 
factors that let the higher the higher
of<00:00:41.940> fitness<00:00:42.270> level<00:00:42.540> someone<00:00:42.809> has<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.530> the

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
of fitness level someone has and the

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.310 
of fitness level someone has and the
stronger<00:00:44.160> they<00:00:44.309> are<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.809> more<00:00:46.020> time<00:00:46.289> that

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
stronger they are the the more time that

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.790 
stronger they are the the more time that
they'll<00:00:46.710> need<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.920> rest<00:00:47.370> before<00:00:50.629> before<00:00:51.800> their

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
they'll need to rest before before their

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.869 
they'll need to rest before before their
competition<00:00:54.739> and<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:56.219> also<00:00:56.340> based<00:00:56.610> on

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879

that's<00:01:14.670> what's<00:01:14.880> worked<00:01:15.120> best<00:01:15.210> for<00:01:15.450> me<00:01:15.570> in<00:01:15.720> the

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
that's what's worked best for me in the

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.800 
that's what's worked best for me in the
past<00:01:16.040> if<00:01:17.040> an<00:01:17.220> Olympic<00:01:17.580> lifter<00:01:17.910> tried<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.690> do

that

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.380 
that
you<00:01:19.260> know<00:01:19.380> they<00:01:19.920> would<00:01:20.070> just<00:01:20.250> feel<00:01:20.460> stiff<00:01:20.970> and

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
you know they would just feel stiff and

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.710 
you know they would just feel stiff and
and<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.770> know<00:01:22.890> their<00:01:23.700> patterns<00:01:24.150> would<00:01:24.450> be<00:01:24.570> way

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
and you know their patterns would be way

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.380 
and you know their patterns would be way
off<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:25.470> thrower<00:01:26.190> would<00:01:26.490> be<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.700> same<00:01:26.910> the<00:01:27.240> same

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
off a thrower would be the same the same

everybody and then throw a PR you know
where<00:01:38.520> that's<00:01:38.730> not<00:01:38.850> gonna<00:01:38.970> work<00:01:39.210> for<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.450> power

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
where that's not gonna work for a power

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.740 
where that's not gonna work for a power
lifter<00:01:40.350> or<00:01:40.380> strong<00:01:40.650> pin<00:01:40.880> so<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:41.910> consider<00:01:42.510> the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
lifter or strong pin so I consider the

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.570 
lifter or strong pin so I consider the
type<00:01:42.900> of<00:01:42.930> competition<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.590> you're<00:01:43.890> that

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
type of competition that you're that

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.969 
type of competition that you're that
you're<00:01:44.700> dealing<00:01:44.940> with<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.360> then<00:01:46.080> you<00:01:46.740> have<00:01:46.860> to

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
you're dealing with and then you have to

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.500 
you're dealing with and then you have to
avoid<00:01:47.190> thinking<00:01:47.520> too<00:01:47.700> early<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.030> think<00:01:48.330> you

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
avoid thinking too early I think you

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.210 
avoid thinking too early I think you
just<00:01:48.690> gotta<00:01:48.930> keep<00:01:49.380> your<00:01:49.560> training<00:01:49.710> slightly

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
just gotta keep your training slightly

just gotta keep your training slightly

greater<00:02:03.030> stress<00:02:03.570> on<00:02:03.720> your<00:02:03.840> central<00:02:04.050> nervous

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
greater stress on your central nervous

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.240 
greater stress on your central nervous
system<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:04.860> it's<00:02:05.490> gonna<00:02:06.120> cause<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:07.250> peak

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
system and it's gonna cause you to peak

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.460 
system and it's gonna cause you to peak
too<00:02:08.580> early<00:02:08.820> an<00:02:09.540> hour<00:02:09.660> just<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.929> get<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.350> get

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
too early an hour just to get to get

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.070 
too early an hour just to get to get
broken<00:02:10.709> down

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.130 

so<00:02:14.680> with<00:02:14.830> that<00:02:14.950> being<00:02:15.160> with<00:02:15.700> that<00:02:15.850> being<00:02:16.030> said

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
so with that being with that being said

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.970 
so with that being with that being said
like<00:02:17.140> you<00:02:17.470> want<00:02:17.620> to<00:02:19.110> keep<00:02:20.110> keep<00:02:20.620> your<00:02:20.770> real

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
like you want to keep keep your real

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.070 
like you want to keep keep your real
heavyweights<00:02:21.490> for<00:02:22.300> for<00:02:22.660> the<00:02:22.750> end<00:02:22.900> of<00:02:23.020> the

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
heavyweights for for the end of the

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.030 
heavyweights for for the end of the
training<00:02:23.320> cycle<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:25.540> and<00:02:26.200> always<00:02:26.350> and<00:02:26.680> always

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
training cycle and and always and always

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.860 
training cycle and and always and always
leave<00:02:27.340> a<00:02:27.400> little<00:02:27.580> bit<00:02:27.820> in<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.150> tank<00:02:28.360> and

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
leave a little bit in the tank and

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.210 
leave a little bit in the tank and
you're<00:02:29.020> always<00:02:29.140> gonna<00:02:29.320> be<00:02:29.470> better<00:02:29.680> off<00:02:29.920> being

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
you're always gonna be better off being

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.340 
you're always gonna be better off being
slightly<00:02:30.700> under<00:02:31.030> trained<00:02:31.360> that's<00:02:32.110> slightly

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
slightly under trained that's slightly

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.990 
slightly under trained that's slightly
over<00:02:32.500> trained<00:02:33.070> so<00:02:34.060> yeah<00:02:34.900> don't<00:02:35.320> worry<00:02:35.590> about

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
over trained so yeah don't worry about

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.450 
over trained so yeah don't worry about
necessarily<00:02:37.500> making<00:02:38.500> a<00:02:38.680> PR<00:02:38.980> in<00:02:39.130> the<00:02:39.220> gym

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
necessarily making a PR in the gym

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.020 
necessarily making a PR in the gym
because<00:02:40.500> if<00:02:41.500> you<00:02:41.650> compete<00:02:41.980> you<00:02:42.370> know<00:02:42.400> PRS<00:02:42.970> in

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
because if you compete you know PRS in

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.760 
because if you compete you know PRS in
the<00:02:43.120> gym<00:02:43.270> don't<00:02:43.420> mean<00:02:43.900> PRS<00:02:44.620> in<00:02:44.710> the

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
the gym don't mean PRS in the

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.880 
the gym don't mean PRS in the
platform<00:02:45.220> or<00:02:45.670> what<00:02:45.820> matter

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
platform or what matter

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.740 
platform or what matter
so<00:02:48.460> you<00:02:48.550> know<00:02:48.640> take<00:02:48.880> five<00:02:49.060> pounds<00:02:49.390> off<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.570> bar

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
so you know take five pounds off the bar

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.210 
so you know take five pounds off the bar
take<00:02:49.960> 10<00:02:50.110> pounds<00:02:50.260> off<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.620> bar<00:02:50.740> do<00:02:50.950> it<00:02:51.040> for<00:02:51.190> a

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
take 10 pounds off the bar do it for a

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.090 
take 10 pounds off the bar do it for a
double<00:02:51.490> instead<00:02:51.670> of<00:02:51.820> a<00:02:51.880> triple<00:02:52.800> and<00:02:53.800> walk<00:02:53.950> away

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
double instead of a triple and walk away

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.920 
double instead of a triple and walk away
from<00:02:54.250> that<00:02:54.400> being<00:02:54.730> able<00:02:54.880> to<00:02:55.000> you<00:02:55.480> know<00:02:55.600> do<00:02:55.780> that

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
from that being able to you know do that

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.570 
from that being able to you know do that
double<00:02:56.290> and<00:02:56.680> walk<00:02:56.860> away<00:02:57.070> from<00:02:57.250> it

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
double and walk away from it

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.370 
double and walk away from it
thinking<00:02:58.360> oh<00:02:58.510> man<00:02:58.690> I<00:02:58.720> could<00:02:58.870> have<00:02:59.050> done<00:02:59.110> four

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
thinking oh man I could have done four

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.140 
thinking oh man I could have done four
with<00:02:59.590> that<00:02:59.770> rather<00:03:00.310> than<00:03:00.580> doing<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:00.880> triple

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
with that rather than doing the triple

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.900 
with that rather than doing the triple
and<00:03:01.630> be<00:03:01.810> an<00:03:01.900> absolute<00:03:02.380> grinder<00:03:02.860> you<00:03:03.460> know<00:03:03.550> and

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
and be an absolute grinder you know and

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.150 
and be an absolute grinder you know and
that<00:03:04.060> effecting<00:03:05.050> your<00:03:05.110> confidence<00:03:05.650> affecting

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
that effecting your confidence affecting

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.470 
that effecting your confidence affecting
your<00:03:06.280> central<00:03:06.580> nervous<00:03:06.610> system<00:03:07.150> affecting

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
your central nervous system affecting

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.710 
your central nervous system affecting
your<00:03:07.600> recovery

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
your recovery

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.410 
your recovery
so<00:03:10.320> so<00:03:11.070> again<00:03:11.490> sum<00:03:11.730> that<00:03:11.850> up<00:03:11.910> you<00:03:12.300> know

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
so so again sum that up you know

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.440 
so so again sum that up you know
consider<00:03:13.020> the<00:03:13.560> athlete<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.850> more<00:03:15.060> fit<00:03:15.270> they

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
consider the athlete the more fit they

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.500 
consider the athlete the more fit they
are<00:03:15.480> and<00:03:16.050> the<00:03:16.740> stronger<00:03:17.100> they<00:03:17.250> are<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.700> longer

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
are and the stronger they are the longer

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.720 
are and the stronger they are the longer
that<00:03:18.660> they'll<00:03:18.840> need<00:03:18.960> to<00:03:19.080> recover<00:03:19.730> consider

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
that they'll need to recover consider

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.630 
that they'll need to recover consider
the<00:03:20.970> type<00:03:21.210> of<00:03:21.240> activity<00:03:21.840> activity<00:03:22.640> that

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
the type of activity activity that

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.470 
the type of activity activity that
they're<00:03:23.790> peaking<00:03:24.120> for<00:03:24.150> if<00:03:25.020> it's<00:03:25.200> a<00:03:25.290> more<00:03:25.440> speed

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
they're peaking for if it's a more speed

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.230 
they're peaking for if it's a more speed
dominant<00:03:27.980> event<00:03:28.980> like<00:03:29.220> Olympic<00:03:29.610> lifting<00:03:29.910> or
