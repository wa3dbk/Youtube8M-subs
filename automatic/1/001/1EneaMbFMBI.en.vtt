 our children feed increasingly isolated to this realization came already 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.160
 the robert-koch-institut in 2006 of about 2,500 tested children and 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.850
 Young people only manage to get the quantities of fruits and vegetables 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.730
 Properly take the society for nutrition in Germany recommends approximately 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.310
 A child should take 400-600 grams per day 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.489
 Sweets are replaced 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:29.269
 even the excessive meat and sausage decorated led to unhealthy 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.829
 Nutrition The Hessian elementary school in Rauschenberg sets a good example 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.510
 About 140 students from grades one to four showed that it was different 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.030
 Gagarin Raneberg is involved in the ONZ driving license action at the 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.519
 Primary school Rauschenbergs 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:46.200
 then extended someone has heard something 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.080
 which we have indexed this house &amp; reason life in the frame 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.800
 of which we now have a big breakfast on the plans for the 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.609
 Children organized 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:58.809
 so everyone gets involved in the action accordingly 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:00:59.390
 Has 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.350
 and Street Triple and fourth grades in school share a breakfast 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.770
 have prepared for all children of the school 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.800
 with sausage cheese and salad where the quota is now about twelve meters 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.600
 long piece of street kicked which are then too fresh invited 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.860
 the action comes also with the children 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.390
 as estimated arrived 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.260
 Very well received among the children so the third and fourth school year 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.280
 It is a steady that every topic of healthy eating from there on 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.440
 Have a timetable 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.570
 and that is green but now the rejection reaction the other hits 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:32.760
 is conceivable 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.670
 Count Bjorn Wagener 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.120
 even more 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.120
 that can not be good for me 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.120
 garnished percent and 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.970
 the other classes also do what Dr 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.490
 The keeper was the best I did 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.760
 and the fire opened 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.500
 "I can not be serious anymore 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.470
 Amnesty

 Password guest so that said they will do from autumn and futility 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.429
 thanks to the courageous intervention it is 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.599
 Classes 3 and 4 have a so-called nutritional license 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.310
 cover the interest in dealing with food and that 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.529

 the action had continued in the next year 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.080
