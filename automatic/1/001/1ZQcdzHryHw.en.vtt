and this kind of plastic symbol overlay
right<00:01:04.619> here<00:01:04.949> really<00:01:05.610> dug<00:01:06.000> into<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.690> lateral

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
right here really dug into the lateral

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.960 
right here really dug into the lateral
side<00:01:07.380> my<00:01:07.530> foot<00:01:07.800> right<00:01:08.100> where<00:01:08.250> my<00:01:08.369> pinky<00:01:08.789> toe

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970

side my foot right where my pinky toe
attaches<00:01:09.899> to<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.190> rest<00:01:11.190> of<00:01:11.340> my<00:01:11.430> foot<00:01:11.869> so<00:01:12.869> we

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
attaches to the rest of my foot so we

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.230 
attaches to the rest of my foot so we
could<00:01:13.140> never<00:01:13.229> wear<00:01:13.580> but<00:01:14.580> then<00:01:14.759> they<00:01:14.910> came<00:01:15.060> out

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
could never wear but then they came out

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.990 
could never wear but then they came out
with<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.420> ISO<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.080> they<00:01:16.170> promised<00:01:17.000> that

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
with the ISO and they promised that

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.059 
with the ISO and they promised that
we're<00:01:18.869> gonna<00:01:18.959> have<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.170> fantastic<00:01:19.740> fit<00:01:19.950> with

00:01:20.059 --> 00:01:20.069 
we're gonna have a fantastic fit with

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:24.770 
we're gonna have a fantastic fit with
this<00:01:20.390> so<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.630> fabric<00:01:21.959> on<00:01:22.440> the<00:01:22.619> upper<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.429> a<00:01:24.240> lot

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
this so the fabric on the upper is a lot

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.719 
this so the fabric on the upper is a lot
more<00:01:25.050> it's<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.619> lot<00:01:25.740> softer<00:01:26.009> it's<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.550> lot

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
more it's a lot softer it's a lot

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.089 
more it's a lot softer it's a lot
smoother<00:01:27.209> if<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.200> put<00:01:28.349> your<00:01:28.500> hand<00:01:28.709> inside<00:01:28.890> of

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:29.099 
smoother if you put your hand inside of

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:31.820 
smoother if you put your hand inside of
here<00:01:29.399> not<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.450> single<00:01:30.750> seam<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:31.530> if<00:01:31.649> you're<00:01:31.800> a

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
here not a single seam so if you're a

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.260 
here not a single seam so if you're a
person<00:01:32.130> who<00:01:32.220> likes<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.520> run<00:01:32.700> without<00:01:32.970> socks

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
person who likes to run without socks

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.040 
person who likes to run without socks
you<00:01:33.539> could<00:01:33.660> probably<00:01:33.869> get<00:01:34.140> away<00:01:34.229> with<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:36.050> the

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
you could probably get away with it the

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.070 
you could probably get away with it the
tongue<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.349> attached<00:01:38.300> the<00:01:39.300> only<00:01:39.599> thing<00:01:39.869> I

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
tongue is attached the only thing I

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.070 
tongue is attached the only thing I
wondered<00:01:40.530> about<00:01:40.649> worried<00:01:41.490> about<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:42.080> right

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
here you can kind of put my hand inside

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.930 
here you can kind of put my hand inside
so<00:01:46.800> you<00:01:46.890> can<00:01:46.950> see<00:01:47.280> what<00:01:47.459> I'm<00:01:47.550> talking<00:01:47.880> about

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.669 
so you can see what I'm talking about
here<00:01:48.300> right<00:01:48.539> here<00:01:49.050> this<00:01:49.200> little<00:01:49.349> plastic

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:49.679 
here right here this little plastic

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:52.729 
here right here this little plastic
strip<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:51.020> wasn't<00:01:52.020> worried<00:01:52.259> about<00:01:52.440> that<00:01:52.590> it's

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:52.739 
strip I wasn't worried about that it's

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:54.050 
strip I wasn't worried about that it's
kind<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:52.950> an<00:01:53.039> overlay<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:53.580> goes<00:01:53.700> across<00:01:53.849> the

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
kind of an overlay that goes across the

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.139 
kind of an overlay that goes across the
top<00:01:54.259> the<00:01:55.259> relay<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.979> really<00:01:56.610> what<00:01:56.819> I<00:01:56.849> didn't

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
top the relay is really what I didn't

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.330 
top the relay is really what I didn't
like<00:01:57.179> about<00:01:57.300> the<00:01:57.599> lasker<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.770> trying<00:01:59.099> sites

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
like about the lasker of trying sites

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.190 
like about the lasker of trying sites
right<00:01:59.520> so<00:02:00.090> it's<00:02:00.239> pretty<00:02:00.509> nervous<00:02:00.780> about<00:02:00.959> that

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
right so it's pretty nervous about that

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.219 
right so it's pretty nervous about that
but<00:02:01.649> it<00:02:01.950> actually<00:02:02.009> wraps<00:02:02.729> right<00:02:03.239> over<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.899> top

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
but it actually wraps right over the top

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.460 
but it actually wraps right over the top
of<00:02:04.259> your<00:02:04.560> instep<00:02:05.009> instead<00:02:05.940> of<00:02:06.119> right<00:02:06.899> along<00:02:07.289> in

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
of your instep instead of right along in

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.070 
of your instep instead of right along in
here<00:02:07.920> which<00:02:08.280> is<00:02:08.390> really<00:02:09.390> what<00:02:09.690> bothered<00:02:10.020> me

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
here which is really what bothered me

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.520 
here which is really what bothered me
last<00:02:10.349> time<00:02:11.030> SuperDuper<00:02:12.030> comfortable<00:02:12.530> upper

we've also got here their power grid
sold<00:02:23.960> unit<00:02:24.350> so<00:02:25.690> really<00:02:26.690> good<00:02:26.840> grip<00:02:27.050> I<00:02:27.320> ran<00:02:28.070> a

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
sold unit so really good grip I ran a

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.750 
sold unit so really good grip I ran a
trail<00:02:29.570> road<00:02:30.200> I<00:02:30.620> would<00:02:30.980> do<00:02:31.070> anything<00:02:31.280> technical

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
trail road I would do anything technical

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.550 
trail road I would do anything technical
technical<00:02:32.180> trails<00:02:32.510> on<00:02:32.630> it<00:02:32.750> but<00:02:33.290> everything

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
technical trails on it but everything

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.360 
technical trails on it but everything
else<00:02:34.330> went<00:02:35.330> perfectly<00:02:35.690> fine<00:02:35.960> no<00:02:36.920> problems

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
else went perfectly fine no problems

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.510 
else went perfectly fine no problems
with<00:02:37.460> grip<00:02:37.730> and<00:02:39.070> actually<00:02:40.070> part<00:02:40.370> of<00:02:40.430> the

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
with grip and actually part of the

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.020 
with grip and actually part of the
revamp<00:02:40.970> of<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:42.680> triumph<00:02:43.040> making<00:02:43.400> it<00:02:43.490> the<00:02:43.580> ISO

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
revamp of the triumph making it the ISO

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.310 
revamp of the triumph making it the ISO
is<00:02:44.410> this<00:02:45.410> is<00:02:45.590> actually<00:02:45.770> not<00:02:46.070> their<00:02:46.310> power<00:02:47.120> grid

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
is this is actually not their power grid

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.800 
is this is actually not their power grid
sole<00:02:48.320> unit<00:02:48.530> it's<00:02:48.830> the<00:02:48.980> power<00:02:49.160> grid<00:02:49.340> plus<00:02:49.810> what

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
sole unit it's the power grid plus what

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.920 
sole unit it's the power grid plus what
that<00:02:51.020> means<00:02:51.290> more<00:02:52.250> cushion<00:02:52.640> so<00:02:53.450> they<00:02:53.660> actually

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
that means more cushion so they actually

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.870 
that means more cushion so they actually
added<00:02:54.080> three<00:02:54.590> millimeters<00:02:55.280> both<00:02:55.640> in<00:02:55.790> the

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
added three millimeters both in the

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.480 
added three millimeters both in the
forefoot<00:02:56.330> and<00:02:56.570> in<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:56.960> heel<00:02:57.230> so<00:02:57.920> it<00:02:57.980> maintains

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
forefoot and in the heel so it maintains

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:59.980 
forefoot and in the heel so it maintains
the<00:02:58.610> same<00:02:58.850> amount<00:02:59.090> of<00:02:59.180> offset<00:02:59.330> so<00:02:59.780> I'll<00:02:59.870> have

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
the same amount of offset so I'll have

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.290 
the same amount of offset so I'll have
them<00:03:00.110> to<00:03:00.170> that<00:03:00.290> eight<00:03:00.470> millimeter<00:03:00.920> offset<00:03:01.370> but

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
them to that eight millimeter offset but

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.970 
them to that eight millimeter offset but
much<00:03:02.810> more<00:03:02.990> cushion<00:03:03.380> up<00:03:03.530> to<00:03:03.620> twenty<00:03:03.920> percent

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
much more cushion up to twenty percent

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.460 
much more cushion up to twenty percent
they<00:03:04.340> said<00:03:04.520> I<00:03:04.840> can't<00:03:05.840> vouch<00:03:05.990> for<00:03:06.050> the<00:03:06.290> twenty

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
they said I can't vouch for the twenty

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:07.870 
they said I can't vouch for the twenty
percent<00:03:06.530> because<00:03:07.070> I<00:03:07.100> couldn't<00:03:07.370> run<00:03:07.520> it<00:03:07.610> enough

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
percent because I couldn't run it enough

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.850 
percent because I couldn't run it enough
and<00:03:08.240> in<00:03:08.360> that<00:03:08.480> last<00:03:08.690> pair<00:03:09.020> but<00:03:09.620> they<00:03:09.710> are

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
and in that last pair but they are

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.070
