 very good to all welcome to a 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.559
 new corner this time it's about iter 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.280
 and aviator and we started as always with 

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:10.280
 the war cries 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.719
 It is very versatile 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.630
 it is a matter of whether they have generated subjects 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.730
 much to your weapons relax a little 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:33.820
 you cling to your weapons 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.820
 relax a little 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.940
 the dance 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.460
 and laughter 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.399
 to nothing 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.600
 we went to the spells and started as 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:00.600
 always by the cv 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.950
 now we are seeing 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.900
 let's go to the w 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.570
 You are watching the w 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.680
 to the m 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.369
 and this is over 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.369
 another w 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.820
 and we're going to launch the the we receive 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.790
 and well there we have seen the network and good 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.910
 there's not much more to teach from this 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.510
 skin I hope you like it and even the
