00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.490
 So today I need one 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.070
 very special 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.939
 www Ostel 

00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:10.549
 is the so-called 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:13.319
 x wants 

00:00:13.319 --> 00:00:16.319
 He looks a bit out of the room 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:19.839
 and is definitely going to be 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:22.839
 built here 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.739
 you become a cross 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:34.970
 if you made the cross 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.390
 Opponents the sheet together again 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.390
 thanks to the corners to the middle 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.600
 then you have 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.600
 to have heard that 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.570
 that on circular routes it stays mild so together 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.070
 that I am here 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.740
 remained alive that were born that BÃ¤rbel Schoen Frankfurt together 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.610
 the initiative 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.820
 US Fleet so grew together 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.930
 back through the top of the study 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.990
 where and how these are 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.179
 Edges meet data of the bills for the site 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.080
 and puts the top all the members 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.840
 then ahead 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.870
 and halve it 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.020
 to get your feet 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.679
 It is always quite good if you have the cymbidium that is twice as must 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.829
 compresses 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:14.829
 because they forgave themselves otherwise 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:21.439
 as precise as possible the wrinkles 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:30.929
 to become the arc 

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:33.929
 up to the high edge of the bridge 

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:38.009
 and again, this is possible 

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:40.809
 yes again 

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:42.359
 he has until the 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:44.639
 Top of the mirror 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:47.639
 and again halved that way 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:08.189
 until the 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.239
 not apart 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.739
 he holds one player 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:28.729
 that looks like this 

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:31.729
 and he actually 

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:34.969
 It is a small one should you 

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:37.429
 Percent with high outstretched arm 

00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:40.759
 Carefully drop with the little push as the most uncertain values 

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:43.629
 if you do that and exactly like this backwards 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:45.199
 you can also try it 

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:46.489
 but 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:50.349
 a glider at its best, it's no reason any we 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:51.719
 come for example 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:55.450
 Percent in the house and stair railings or so slow sailing 

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:56.429
 have fun
