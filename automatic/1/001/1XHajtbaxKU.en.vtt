this<00:01:13.640> is<00:01:13.820> actually<00:01:14.270> how<00:01:14.450> that<00:01:14.659> mechanism

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
this is actually how that mechanism

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:16.410 
this is actually how that mechanism
works<00:01:15.470> right<00:01:15.710> there

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
works right there

works right there
it's<00:01:17.420> basically<00:01:17.960> just<00:01:18.200> two<00:01:18.409> gears<00:01:19.040> that<00:01:19.280> opens

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
it's basically just two gears that opens

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.990 
it's basically just two gears that opens
and<00:01:19.759> closes<00:01:19.970> a<00:01:20.149> flap<00:01:20.540> on<00:01:20.780> the<00:01:20.810> backside<00:01:21.880> it's<00:01:22.880> a

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
and closes a flap on the backside it's a

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.080 
and closes a flap on the backside it's a
nice<00:01:23.210> easy<00:01:23.479> thing<00:01:23.869> to<00:01:23.899> replace<00:01:25.090> reinstalling

much soap locates just like that put
your<00:01:40.610> two<00:01:40.789> screws<00:01:41.119> in

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.940

crack in it right there that's pretty

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.130 
crack in it right there that's pretty
typical<00:02:24.180> that<00:02:25.180> would<00:02:25.330> be<00:02:25.480> one<00:02:25.630> of<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.810> reasons

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
typical that would be one of the reasons

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.690 
typical that would be one of the reasons
why<00:02:26.319> you'd<00:02:26.470> be<00:02:26.620> replacing<00:02:27.190> the<00:02:27.280> wood<00:02:27.459> trim

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
it's hard to see I bet but it's like a

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.100 
it's hard to see I bet but it's like a
little<00:02:30.430> crack<00:02:30.849> that<00:02:31.090> runs<00:02:31.269> along<00:02:31.630> this<00:02:31.900> way

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
little crack that runs along this way

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.770 
little crack that runs along this way
right<00:02:32.349> here<00:02:32.700> it's<00:02:33.700> not<00:02:33.880> fully<00:02:34.150> crack<00:02:34.510> it's

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
right here it's not fully crack it's

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.640 
right here it's not fully crack it's
like<00:02:34.959> in<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.260> outside<00:02:35.950> finish<00:02:36.400> but<00:02:37.650> sometimes

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
like in the outside finish but sometimes

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
like in the outside finish but sometimes
they<00:02:38.860> get<00:02:38.980> cracks<00:02:39.310> all<00:02:39.519> the<00:02:39.640> way<00:02:39.760> through<00:02:39.970> them

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.239
