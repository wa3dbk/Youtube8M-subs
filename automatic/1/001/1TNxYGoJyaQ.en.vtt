00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.550
 Koran brought relieve 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.420
 Quran stands 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.980
 and if it does not work 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.840
 he answers yes 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.420
 after the example 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.710

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.620
 I would not have used them food that is probably clear 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.370
 or not started at all 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.470
