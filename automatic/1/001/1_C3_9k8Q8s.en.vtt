we<00:00:04.590> get<00:00:04.740> to<00:00:04.830> jump<00:00:05.070> into<00:00:05.250> a<00:00:05.430> special<00:00:05.940> kind<00:00:06.120> of

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
we get to jump into a special kind of

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.849 
we get to jump into a special kind of
lighting<00:00:06.480> now<00:00:06.630> called<00:00:06.990> image<00:00:07.319> based<00:00:07.590> lighting

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
lighting now called image based lighting

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.390 
lighting now called image based lighting
or<00:00:08.220> as<00:00:08.340> it's<00:00:08.550> often<00:00:08.940> referred<00:00:09.090> to<00:00:09.269> I<00:00:09.480> BL<00:00:10.250> it<00:00:11.250> is

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
or as it's often referred to I BL it is

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.190 
or as it's often referred to I BL it is
a<00:00:11.430> unique<00:00:11.790> light<00:00:12.000> in<00:00:12.180> the<00:00:12.270> fact<00:00:12.540> that<00:00:12.900> it

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
a unique light in the fact that it

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.930 
a unique light in the fact that it
doesn't<00:00:13.530> behave<00:00:13.950> like<00:00:14.010> any<00:00:14.280> of<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.760> other

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
doesn't behave like any of the other

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.580 
doesn't behave like any of the other
lights<00:00:15.300> let's<00:00:15.960> go<00:00:16.080> ahead<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.289> make<00:00:16.410> sure

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
lights let's go ahead and make sure

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.650 
lights let's go ahead and make sure
we've<00:00:16.920> got<00:00:17.160> that<00:00:17.400> activated<00:00:18.029> right<00:00:18.180> now<00:00:18.420> I'm

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
we've got that activated right now I'm

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.029 
we've got that activated right now I'm
going<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:19.019> come<00:00:19.199> up<00:00:19.350> two<00:00:20.030> lights<00:00:21.030> I<00:00:21.770> feel<00:00:22.770> like

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
going to come up two lights I feel like

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.670 
going to come up two lights I feel like
now<00:00:24.030> I<00:00:24.060> rename<00:00:24.539> that<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:25.050> we<00:00:25.200> see<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.440> show<00:00:25.619> up

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
now I rename that and we see it show up

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.310 
now I rename that and we see it show up
in<00:00:25.770> the<00:00:25.890> scene<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.880> is<00:00:27.030> different<00:00:27.750> because

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
in the scene and it is different because

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.230 
in the scene and it is different because
it's<00:00:28.560> kind<00:00:28.860> of<00:00:29.010> like<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.760> best<00:00:29.940> way<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.090> get

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
it's kind of like the best way to get

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.700 
it's kind of like the best way to get
your<00:00:30.330> head<00:00:30.449> around<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.840> is<00:00:30.990> that<00:00:31.020> it<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.560> like

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
your head around it is that it is like

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.130 
your head around it is that it is like
creating<00:00:32.279> an<00:00:32.369> entire<00:00:32.789> world<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.629> light<00:00:33.930> around

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
creating an entire world of light around

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.440 
creating an entire world of light around
you<00:00:34.590> in<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.399> same<00:00:35.609> way<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.030> indirect

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
you in the same way that the indirect

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.600 
you in the same way that the indirect
light<00:00:36.690> or<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.050> infinite<00:00:37.440> light<00:00:37.620> projects<00:00:38.250> the

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
light or the infinite light projects the

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.979 
light or the infinite light projects the
same<00:00:38.850> direction<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.329> light<00:00:39.510> all<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.960> time

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
same direction of light all the time

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.490 
same direction of light all the time
like<00:00:40.470> a<00:00:40.500> Sun<00:00:40.860> Daz<00:00:41.390> IBL<00:00:42.390> lighting<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:42.960> based<00:00:43.290> on

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
like a Sun Daz IBL lighting is based on

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.889 
like a Sun Daz IBL lighting is based on
a<00:00:43.530> sphere<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.370> goes<00:00:44.640> ahead<00:00:44.790> and<00:00:45.180> shines<00:00:45.600> light

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
a sphere and goes ahead and shines light

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.560 
a sphere and goes ahead and shines light
into<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.380> the<00:00:46.739> easiest<00:00:47.070> way<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.489> show<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:48.360> that

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
into it the easiest way to show you that

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.500 
into it the easiest way to show you that
is<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.710> go<00:00:49.829> ahead<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.340> open<00:00:50.430> up<00:00:50.790> the<00:00:50.969> advanced

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
is to go ahead and open up the advanced

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.090 
is to go ahead and open up the advanced
materials<00:00:51.690> property<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.739> we'll<00:00:52.860> be<00:00:52.950> looking

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
materials property and we'll be looking

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.260 
materials property and we'll be looking
at<00:00:53.370> this<00:00:53.489> more<00:00:53.730> with<00:00:53.880> some<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.149> other

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
at this more with some of the other

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.600 
at this more with some of the other
lights<00:00:54.510> we<00:00:55.230> know<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.559> we<00:00:55.649> can<00:00:55.829> change<00:00:56.219> the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
lights we know that we can change the

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.430 
lights we know that we can change the
light<00:00:56.879> color<00:00:57.210> over<00:00:57.300> here<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:58.110> the<00:00:58.170> strength

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
light color over here and the strength

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.280 
light color over here and the strength
of<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.649> light<00:00:58.910> but<00:00:59.910> we<00:01:00.239> what<00:01:00.690> we<00:01:00.809> don't<00:01:01.050> see

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
of the light but we what we don't see

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.770 
of the light but we what we don't see
and<00:01:01.500> I've<00:01:01.559> got<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.890> opposing<00:01:02.340> camera<00:01:02.640> set<00:01:02.850> so

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
and I've got the opposing camera set so

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.139 
and I've got the opposing camera set so
I<00:01:03.809> move<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:04.140> around<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.920> Ibo<00:01:05.519> light<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.909> not

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:06.149 
I move this around the Ibo light is not

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:08.149 
I move this around the Ibo light is not
showing<00:01:06.509> up<00:01:06.719> as<00:01:06.869> something<00:01:07.049> we<00:01:07.350> can<00:01:07.530> normally

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
showing up as something we can normally

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.770 
showing up as something we can normally
see<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.640> manipulate<00:01:09.119> because<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.570> just

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
see and manipulate because it just

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.930 
see and manipulate because it just
doesn't<00:01:10.049> work<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.500> way<00:01:10.710> when<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.580> come<00:01:11.760> down

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940

types<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.220> light<00:01:26.490> blending<00:01:27.150> but<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.170> can<00:01:28.290> see

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
types of light blending but you can see

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.230 
types of light blending but you can see
that<00:01:28.650> there<00:01:28.830> is<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.979> texture<00:01:29.520> map<00:01:29.670> loaded<00:01:30.090> in

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
that there is a texture map loaded in

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.630 
that there is a texture map loaded in
and<00:01:30.439> then<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.530> can<00:01:31.680> see<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:31.920> it's<00:01:32.189> plugged

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
and then you can see that it's plugged

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.130 
and then you can see that it's plugged
into<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.000> color<00:01:33.210> channel<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.810> diffuse

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
into the color channel of the diffuse

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.210 
into the color channel of the diffuse
channel<00:01:34.470> just<00:01:34.680> like<00:01:34.770> when<00:01:35.009> we're<00:01:35.130> working

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
channel just like when we're working

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.730 
channel just like when we're working
with<00:01:35.520> materials<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.150> objects<00:01:36.509> so<00:01:37.200> what<00:01:37.590> we've

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
with materials and objects so what we've

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.850 
with materials and objects so what we've
got<00:01:37.920> going<00:01:38.130> on<00:01:38.369> is<00:01:38.909> this<00:01:39.299> bright<00:01:39.750> type<00:01:40.650> of

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
got going on is this bright type of

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.890 
got going on is this bright type of
image<00:01:41.520> that's<00:01:41.850> being<00:01:42.060> toned<00:01:42.420> down<00:01:42.570> by<00:01:42.840> the

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
image that's being toned down by the

tracing has to be turned on in the
render<00:01:53.400> settings<00:01:53.670> so<00:01:54.420> let's<00:01:54.659> do<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.840> quick

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
render settings so let's do a quick

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.270 
render settings so let's do a quick
little<00:01:55.170> render<00:01:55.530> just<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.860> see<00:01:56.040> what<00:01:56.159> this

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
little render just to see what this

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.149 
little render just to see what this
looks<00:01:56.549> like<00:01:56.640> right<00:01:56.970> now

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
looks like right now

00:01:58.159 --> 00:01:59.489 
looks like right now
it'll<00:01:58.369> think<00:01:58.490> about<00:01:58.700> it<00:01:58.820> for<00:01:58.969> a<00:01:58.999> second<00:01:59.329> and

00:01:59.489 --> 00:01:59.499 
it'll think about it for a second and

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:01.480 
it'll think about it for a second and
we'll<00:02:00.499> get<00:02:00.619> something<00:02:00.859> that<00:02:00.950> actually<00:02:01.280> looks

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
we'll get something that actually looks

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.069 
we'll get something that actually looks
a<00:02:01.579> little<00:02:01.670> bit<00:02:01.909> strange<00:02:02.359> it's<00:02:02.749> doing<00:02:02.960> the

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
a little bit strange it's doing the

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:04.809 
a little bit strange it's doing the
subsurface<00:02:03.649> scattering<00:02:03.770> for<00:02:04.280> the<00:02:04.369> skin<00:02:04.700> on

00:02:04.809 --> 00:02:04.819 
subsurface scattering for the skin on

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:07.240 
subsurface scattering for the skin on
the<00:02:04.909> character<00:02:05.329> right<00:02:05.509> now<00:02:05.890> the<00:02:06.890> one<00:02:07.069> thing

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
the character right now the one thing

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.430 
the character right now the one thing
that<00:02:07.369> IBL<00:02:07.759> lighting<00:02:08.060> does<00:02:08.299> tremendously<00:02:09.200> well

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
that IBL lighting does tremendously well

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.250 
that IBL lighting does tremendously well
is<00:02:09.739> that<00:02:10.069> it<00:02:10.340> helps<00:02:10.610> cast<00:02:11.269> reflections<00:02:12.110> on

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
is that it helps cast reflections on

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.960 
is that it helps cast reflections on
everything<00:02:12.680> since<00:02:13.310> you<00:02:13.400> have<00:02:13.519> an<00:02:13.610> entire

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
everything since you have an entire

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.580 
everything since you have an entire
environment<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:14.900> this<00:02:14.989> looks<00:02:15.140> like<00:02:15.200> a<00:02:15.290> funny

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
environment and this looks like a funny

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.110 
environment and this looks like a funny
picture<00:02:15.799> but<00:02:16.129> it's<00:02:16.250> bent<00:02:16.519> around<00:02:16.670> a<00:02:16.879> sphere

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
picture but it's bent around a sphere

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.820 
picture but it's bent around a sphere
and<00:02:17.209> then<00:02:17.330> flattened<00:02:17.780> out<00:02:17.870> into<00:02:18.170> a<00:02:18.200> square<00:02:18.620> is

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
and then flattened out into a square is

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:19.780 
and then flattened out into a square is
the<00:02:18.920> reason<00:02:19.160> we're<00:02:19.280> getting<00:02:19.430> these<00:02:19.519> funny

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
the reason we're getting these funny

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.789 
the reason we're getting these funny
little<00:02:19.970> distortions<00:02:20.569> and<00:02:20.720> it's<00:02:21.349> also<00:02:21.500> an

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799 
little distortions and it's also an

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:24.160 
little distortions and it's also an
interior<00:02:22.430> shot<00:02:22.910> it's<00:02:23.150> not<00:02:23.330> well<00:02:23.690> I<00:02:23.720> guess<00:02:23.900> it

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
interior shot it's not well I guess it

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.809 
interior shot it's not well I guess it
is<00:02:24.260> actually<00:02:24.620> an<00:02:24.680> exterior<00:02:25.160> shot<00:02:25.430> now<00:02:25.670> that

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
is actually an exterior shot now that

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.020 
is actually an exterior shot now that
I'm<00:02:25.910> looking<00:02:26.060> at<00:02:26.330> it<00:02:26.480> but<00:02:27.290> it's<00:02:27.890> unusual<00:02:28.310> but

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
I'm looking at it but it's unusual but

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.690 
I'm looking at it but it's unusual but
does<00:02:29.330> provide<00:02:29.360> for<00:02:29.720> very<00:02:30.470> nice<00:02:30.769> types<00:02:31.519> of

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
does provide for very nice types of

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.940 
does provide for very nice types of
reflections<00:02:32.269> so<00:02:33.049> if<00:02:33.349> we<00:02:33.500> want<00:02:33.709> to<00:02:33.769> actually

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
reflections so if we want to actually

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.009 
reflections so if we want to actually
use<00:02:34.190> it<00:02:34.610> as<00:02:34.760> a<00:02:34.790> light<00:02:35.060> source<00:02:35.329> we<00:02:35.629> need<00:02:35.750> to<00:02:35.870> go

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
use it as a light source we need to go

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.620 
use it as a light source we need to go
into<00:02:36.290> our<00:02:36.560> render<00:02:36.890> settings

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
into our render settings

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.230 
into our render settings
and<00:02:38.720> we<00:02:39.230> have<00:02:39.350> to<00:02:39.470> engage<00:02:39.590> in<00:02:40.310> direct<00:02:40.790> light

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
and we have to engage in direct light

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.960 
and we have to engage in direct light
while<00:02:42.080> reflective<00:02:42.860> services<00:02:43.310> are<00:02:43.430> picking<00:02:43.820> up

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
while reflective services are picking up

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.480 
while reflective services are picking up
the<00:02:44.540> texture<00:02:45.020> map<00:02:45.200> it's<00:02:45.920> not<00:02:46.040> actually

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
the texture map it's not actually

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.090 
the texture map it's not actually
casting<00:02:47.030> any<00:02:47.150> lights<00:02:47.450> yet<00:02:47.690> so<00:02:48.410> when<00:02:48.710> we<00:02:48.860> turn

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
casting any lights yet so when we turn

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.820 
casting any lights yet so when we turn
that<00:02:49.340> on<00:02:49.580> we<00:02:50.210> get<00:02:50.390> some<00:02:50.690> indirect<00:02:51.590> light

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
that on we get some indirect light

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.320 
that on we get some indirect light
that's<00:02:52.070> going<00:02:52.340> on<00:02:52.490> and<00:02:52.670> we<00:02:52.730> have<00:02:52.850> the<00:02:52.880> ability

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
that's going on and we have the ability

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.110 
that's going on and we have the ability
to<00:02:53.360> adjust<00:02:53.860> both<00:02:54.860> how<00:02:55.160> many<00:02:55.340> times<00:02:55.700> the

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
to adjust both how many times the

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.330 
to adjust both how many times the
computer<00:02:56.600> goes<00:02:56.840> over<00:02:57.140> and<00:02:57.260> processes<00:02:57.950> and<00:02:58.130> re

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
computer goes over and processes and re

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.460 
computer goes over and processes and re
processes<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.180> light<00:02:59.390> for<00:03:00.020> believability

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
processes the light for believability

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.820 
processes the light for believability
and<00:03:00.800> then<00:03:01.760> just<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.210> quality<00:03:02.660> of<00:03:02.780> it<00:03:02.930> here<00:03:03.170> so

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
and then just the quality of it here so

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
and then just the quality of it here so
I'm<00:03:03.920> going<00:03:04.040> to<00:03:04.160> leave<00:03:04.400> it<00:03:04.550> at<00:03:04.610> the<00:03:04.700> default

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
I'm going to leave it at the default

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.120 
I'm going to leave it at the default
right<00:03:05.480> now<00:03:05.750> but<00:03:06.080> we'll<00:03:06.230> come<00:03:06.470> in<00:03:06.620> later<00:03:06.890> and

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
right now but we'll come in later and

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.050 
right now but we'll come in later and
start<00:03:07.400> working<00:03:07.640> with<00:03:07.760> it

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
start working with it

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.010 
start working with it
and<00:03:08.210> let's<00:03:08.900> go<00:03:09.050> ahead<00:03:09.170> and<00:03:09.590> say<00:03:09.980> render<00:03:10.520> now

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
and let's go ahead and say render now

back on now I do have the raytrace

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:37.459 
back on now I do have the raytrace
preview<00:04:36.719> right<00:04:36.810> here<00:04:36.870> so<00:04:37.169> let<00:04:37.259> me<00:04:37.289> go<00:04:37.349> ahead

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:44.179 
going on thinks about it for a second
and<00:04:41.879> then<00:04:42.659> we<00:04:42.810> get<00:04:42.990> this<00:04:43.169> one<00:04:43.379> particular<00:04:43.919> view

00:04:44.179 --> 00:04:44.189 
and then we get this one particular view

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:47.119 
and then we get this one particular view
and<00:04:44.400> that's<00:04:44.520> fine<00:04:44.879> but<00:04:45.090> it's<00:04:45.240> not<00:04:45.330> true<00:04:45.990> to<00:04:46.650> the

here and she's render this time in a
little<00:04:57.539> larger<00:04:57.810> format<00:04:58.199> we'll<00:04:58.409> see<00:04:58.620> this

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
little larger format we'll see this

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.619 
little larger format we'll see this
taking<00:04:59.370> place<00:04:59.550> all<00:05:00.000> the<00:05:00.060> little<00:05:00.300> red<00:05:00.419> dots
