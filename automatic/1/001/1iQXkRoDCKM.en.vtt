00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello my name is denis sellers and 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.950
 i keep telling you how 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.259
 shoot video with high quality 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.000
 your mirror or mirrorless 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.260
 cameras and today tell you about 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.260
 such cool stuff like 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.529
 so why do you need soul motion I have well 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.330
 why do you need to talk about it as 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.279
 separate topic and think about it during 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.020
 shooting because many will say that you can 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.970
 take and just notice the material in 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:38.620
 during the installation process, what are we trying to do 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:40.750
 so as you can see it looks not so much 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.250
 very cool of course a hopeless situation 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.260
 when you really need a slowdown 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.090
 in another way just can not do 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.750
 take the footage and slow it down 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.010
 on mounting 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.750
 but we want to get you 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.309
 the highest quality result and with 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.579
 of what we have so for us 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.530
 it needs a moment of theory why 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.180
 removes the filmed material and then slowing down 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.550
 we got it in the process of installation 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.469
 to put it mildly building a result matter in 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.570
 that we filmed at 25 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.580
 frames per second so then slowing down 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.560
 material at 50 percent ie two 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.240
 times we got roughly 12 s 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.009
 half frames well for comfortable 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.140
 Of course this is not enough playback 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.720
 respectively 25 frames per second 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.520
 Well, to put it mildly, not enough to 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.320
 get a quality slowdown of course 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.080
 there are other software plugins 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.850
 in order to achieve a result even 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.950
 with material shot at 25 frames in 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.260
 second but today we will talk about another 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.790
 technology and this technology is accelerated 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.780
 shooting that is shooting with great 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.729
 number of frames 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.740
 if you've ever heard of this i 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.750
 problem with this question you of course in 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.610
 course that a lot of cameras now 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.020
 removed as fast as 100 frames 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.270
 per second and even higher 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.610
 but we 'll talk about what can 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.799
 make your canon line camera 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.570
 or in the lineup nikon in general we will 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.189
 discuss what we have if we 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.180
 we want to get a quality slow motion 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:56.920
 we need 50p mode 50p mode allows 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.720
 we shoot at frame rates of two 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.640
 times more than 25 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.409
 that is, with a subsequent slowdown, we 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.710
 get with you from 50 frames 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.570
 slows down and twice exactly 25 frames 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.280
 then the slowdown will be smooth and 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.290
 it will look just incredible 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.640
 what we need to do 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.150
 Go to the camera settings in the mode 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.610
 video we turn on the mode with a mark of 50 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.350
 n by the way it is very pity that the company has canon 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.230
 yet provides users 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.630
 50p mode only at 1280 resolution 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.850
 720 points but slowdown will be 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.430
 quality and so set the mode 50p 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.380
 turn on and try to shoot a small 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.540
 nuance when shooting in 50-frame mode 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.950
 try to set the shutter speed as much as possible 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.670
 shorter otherwise you risk 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.800
 receive 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.880
 sickly motion blur for example when 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.880
 shutter speed 150 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.470
 But if you put the shutter speed 1 100 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.900
 then you will succeed sharply and clearly and 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.790
 very slowly summing up again 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.250
 compare material slow on installation 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.640
 and the material is filmed with a lot of 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.310
 frames 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.080
 as you can see the result is obvious on this 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.720
 while all my name is denis protasov 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.720
 watch my video study and shoot
