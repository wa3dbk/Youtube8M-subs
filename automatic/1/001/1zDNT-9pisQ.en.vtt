you<00:00:02.719> can<00:00:02.899> also<00:00:03.170> use<00:00:03.679> shells<00:00:04.100> to<00:00:04.430> pipe<00:00:04.700> a<00:00:04.939> daisy

00:00:05.499 --> 00:00:05.509 
you can also use shells to pipe a daisy

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:08.709 
you can also use shells to pipe a daisy
and<00:00:06.170> you<00:00:06.410> do<00:00:06.589> this<00:00:06.799> by<00:00:07.129> piping<00:00:07.879> shells<00:00:08.330> in<00:00:08.660> a

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:08.719 
and you do this by piping shells in a

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.459 
and you do this by piping shells in a
circular<00:00:09.020> pattern<00:00:09.469> and<00:00:09.940> then<00:00:10.940> using<00:00:11.840> a<00:00:12.139> star

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:12.469 
circular pattern and then using a star

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:15.340 
circular pattern and then using a star
tip<00:00:12.740> to<00:00:13.010> make<00:00:13.279> the<00:00:13.549> center<00:00:14.090> I'm<00:00:14.900> going<00:00:15.139> to<00:00:15.230> show

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:15.350 
tip to make the center I'm going to show

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:16.660 
tip to make the center I'm going to show
you<00:00:15.379> how<00:00:15.469> to<00:00:15.559> do<00:00:15.619> that<00:00:15.770> in<00:00:15.830> a<00:00:15.889> second<00:00:16.250> but<00:00:16.400> first

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670 
you how to do that in a second but first

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.609 
you how to do that in a second but first
you<00:00:16.850> want<00:00:17.029> to<00:00:17.060> pipe<00:00:17.270> the<00:00:17.480> petals<00:00:17.900> and<00:00:18.140> the

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619 
you want to pipe the petals and the

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.259 
you want to pipe the petals and the
practice<00:00:19.009> board<00:00:19.279> she<00:00:19.640> is<00:00:19.820> actually<00:00:20.089> pretty

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:20.269 
practice board she is actually pretty

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:22.179 
practice board she is actually pretty
good<00:00:20.419> it<00:00:20.570> gives<00:00:20.720> you<00:00:20.900> a<00:00:20.929> nice<00:00:21.410> diagram<00:00:22.009> you<00:00:22.130> can

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189 
good it gives you a nice diagram you can

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.359 
good it gives you a nice diagram you can
either<00:00:22.429> use<00:00:22.640> the<00:00:22.880> lines<00:00:23.179> to<00:00:23.689> go<00:00:23.839> by<00:00:24.019> or<00:00:24.349> if<00:00:25.070> you

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
either use the lines to go by or if you

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.159 
either use the lines to go by or if you
want<00:00:25.640> to<00:00:25.759> know<00:00:25.880> how<00:00:26.029> hard<00:00:26.300> to<00:00:26.449> squeeze<00:00:26.480> the<00:00:26.960> bag

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:27.169 
want to know how hard to squeeze the bag

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:29.409 
want to know how hard to squeeze the bag
so<00:00:27.499> that<00:00:27.710> you<00:00:27.800> get<00:00:27.980> you<00:00:28.220> know<00:00:28.339> even<00:00:28.909> thickness

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:29.419 
so that you get you know even thickness

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:32.019 
so that you get you know even thickness
in<00:00:29.659> your<00:00:29.900> shell<00:00:30.349> petals<00:00:30.769> then<00:00:31.189> you<00:00:31.579> can<00:00:31.789> pipe

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
in your shell petals then you can pipe

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.400 
in your shell petals then you can pipe
right<00:00:32.360> on<00:00:32.509> top<00:00:32.720> of<00:00:32.840> the<00:00:32.900> picture<00:00:33.079> here<00:00:35.410> just

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
right on top of the picture here just

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.110 
right on top of the picture here just
remember<00:00:36.710> that<00:00:37.010> you<00:00:37.130> want<00:00:37.340> to<00:00:37.460> start<00:00:37.850> your

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
remember that you want to start your

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.720 
remember that you want to start your
shell<00:00:38.510> out<00:00:38.840> at<00:00:39.320> the<00:00:39.620> tip<00:00:39.860> of<00:00:40.010> the<00:00:40.070> petal<00:00:40.520> and

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
shell out at the tip of the petal and

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:55.900 
shell out at the tip of the petal and
then<00:00:41.030> bring<00:00:41.750> it<00:00:41.780> back<00:00:41.990> towards<00:00:42.860> the<00:00:43.070> center

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.070 

then<00:00:56.910> once<00:00:57.240> you<00:00:57.360> have<00:00:57.390> all<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.720> the<00:00:57.870> petals

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.080 
then once you have all of the petals

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.270 
then once you have all of the petals
piped<00:00:58.470> you're<00:00:58.710> going<00:00:58.830> to<00:00:58.890> want<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.100> do<00:00:59.250> a

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
piped you're going to want to do a

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.160 
piped you're going to want to do a
rosette<00:00:59.820> for<00:01:00.060> the<00:01:00.150> center<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.780> you're<00:01:01.050> going

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
rosette for the center and you're going

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.500 
rosette for the center and you're going
to<00:01:01.230> use<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.350> star<00:01:01.740> tip<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.040> start<00:01:02.940> out<00:01:03.120> by<00:01:03.300> just

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
to use a star tip and start out by just

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.920 
to use a star tip and start out by just
piping<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.930> star<00:01:04.230> and<00:01:04.730> then<00:01:05.730> lift<00:01:06.210> your<00:01:06.390> tip<00:01:06.660> up

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
piping a star and then lift your tip up

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.490 
piping a star and then lift your tip up
and<00:01:07.460> let<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.610> icing<00:01:08.790> fall<00:01:09.390> on<00:01:09.690> the<00:01:10.020> corners<00:01:10.470> of

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
and let the icing fall on the corners of

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.920 
and let the icing fall on the corners of
the<00:01:10.740> star<00:01:11.010> as<00:01:11.190> you<00:01:11.340> bring<00:01:11.550> it<00:01:11.670> round<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.270> what

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
the star as you bring it round and what

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.130 
the star as you bring it round and what
you<00:01:13.050> want<00:01:13.230> to<00:01:13.350> do<00:01:13.620> is<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:14.040> actually<00:01:14.280> want<00:01:14.940> to

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
you want to do is you actually want to

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.320 
you want to do is you actually want to
stop<00:01:16.140> squeezing<00:01:16.800> about<00:01:17.550> 3/4<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.270> way

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
stop squeezing about 3/4 of the way

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.630 
stop squeezing about 3/4 of the way
around<00:01:18.540> then<00:01:18.930> release<00:01:19.260> pressure<00:01:19.680> but<00:01:20.340> still

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
around then release pressure but still

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.130 
around then release pressure but still
bring<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.030> tip<00:01:21.240> all<00:01:21.480> the<00:01:21.510> way<00:01:21.630> back<00:01:21.930> around

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
bring the tip all the way back around

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.620 
bring the tip all the way back around
and<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.620> gives<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.310> nice<00:01:24.000> little<00:01:24.270> finish

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
and that gives you a nice little finish

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.230 
and that gives you a nice little finish
to<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.900> rosette<00:01:25.290> Center<00:01:25.740> again<00:01:26.670> here<00:01:27.030> when

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
to the rosette Center again here when

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.730 
to the rosette Center again here when
you're<00:01:27.390> making<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.840> petals<00:01:28.260> just<00:01:28.410> think

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
you're making the petals just think

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.230 
you're making the petals just think
about<00:01:28.830> making<00:01:29.160> a<00:01:29.430> shell<00:01:29.729> because<00:01:29.850> that's<00:01:30.090> all

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
about making a shell because that's all

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.120 
about making a shell because that's all
you're<00:01:30.450> doing<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:31.290> want<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.590> bag<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.890> be<00:01:32.010> at<00:01:32.070> a

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
you're doing you want the bag to be at a

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.590 
you're doing you want the bag to be at a
45<00:01:32.610> degree<00:01:32.640> angle

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
45 degree angle

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.290 
45 degree angle
hold<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.770> bag<00:01:34.979> for<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.490> second<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.090> let<00:01:36.180> the

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
hold the bag for a second and let the

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.000 
hold the bag for a second and let the
icing<00:01:36.450> build<00:01:36.840> up<00:01:36.990> in<00:01:37.140> front<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.500> tip<00:01:37.740> while

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
icing build up in front the tip while

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.770 
icing build up in front the tip while
you<00:01:38.100> slowly<00:01:38.460> release<00:01:38.880> pressure<00:01:39.150> as<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.540> pull

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
you slowly release pressure as you pull

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.140 
you slowly release pressure as you pull
the<00:01:39.810> bag<00:01:40.050> away<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.650> then<00:01:41.430> when<00:01:41.850> you're<00:01:42.119> ready

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
the bag away and then when you're ready

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.330 
the bag away and then when you're ready
to<00:01:42.420> do<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.020> center<00:01:43.470> it's<00:01:43.890> going<00:01:44.010> to<00:01:44.160> be<00:01:44.310> a

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
to do the center it's going to be a

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.030 
to do the center it's going to be a
rosette<00:01:44.910> which<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.479> star<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.560> has<00:01:46.770> been

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
rosette which is a star that has been

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.359 
rosette which is a star that has been
kind<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.490> over<00:01:47.910> piped<00:01:48.300> and<00:01:48.630> just<00:01:49.590> remember<00:01:50.070> to

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
kind of over piped and just remember to

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.609 
kind of over piped and just remember to
stop<00:01:50.700> squeezing<00:01:51.090> 3/4<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.020> way<00:01:52.140> around<00:01:52.440> but

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
stop squeezing 3/4 of the way around but

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.680 
stop squeezing 3/4 of the way around but
then<00:01:52.800> still<00:01:53.070> bring<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.820> tip<00:01:54.090> all<00:01:54.330> the<00:01:54.540> way

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
then still bring the tip all the way

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.240 
then still bring the tip all the way
back<00:01:55.020> around<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.650> get<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.800> nice<00:01:56.009> little

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250
