00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:58.400 
on this side having done the front cab
part<00:02:53.150> yet

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.240 

and<00:02:59.410> you<00:02:59.890> know<00:02:59.980> I<00:03:00.010> haven't<00:03:00.280> done<00:03:00.370> this<00:03:00.550> side

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
and you know I haven't done this side

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:13.460 
and you know I haven't done this side
but<00:03:03.250> you<00:03:03.580> can<00:03:03.730> see<00:03:03.970> how<00:03:04.150> bad<00:03:04.420> hot<00:03:06.480> stripes<00:03:07.480> work

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:26.040 

now<00:03:14.470> it<00:03:14.890> is<00:03:23.730> it's<00:03:24.730> pretty<00:03:24.970> smooth<00:03:25.300> and<00:03:25.600> you<00:03:25.900> can

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
now it is it's pretty smooth and you can

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.670 
now it is it's pretty smooth and you can
see<00:03:26.319> the<00:03:27.690> indentions<00:03:28.690> but<00:03:28.989> you<00:03:29.140> don't<00:03:29.350> feel

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
see the indentions but you don't feel

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.390 
see the indentions but you don't feel
them<00:03:32.160> so<00:03:33.160> I<00:03:33.190> think<00:03:33.519> once<00:03:33.910> the<00:03:34.090> primer<00:03:34.390> goes<00:03:34.780> on

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
them so I think once the primer goes on

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.180 
them so I think once the primer goes on
that<00:03:36.400> will<00:03:36.640> probably<00:03:37.180> fill<00:03:37.510> in<00:03:38.430> all<00:03:39.430> of<00:03:39.489> the

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
that will probably fill in all of the

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.840 
that will probably fill in all of the
little<00:03:42.190> bitty<00:03:43.380> indentions<00:03:44.670> plus<00:03:45.670> I'll

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
little bitty indentions plus I'll

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.340 
little bitty indentions plus I'll
probably<00:03:46.090> hit<00:03:46.239> it<00:03:46.390> with<00:03:46.510> a<00:03:46.540> finer<00:03:46.900> sandpaper

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
probably hit it with a finer sandpaper

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:53.630 
probably hit it with a finer sandpaper
to<00:03:47.830> once<00:03:48.670> I<00:03:48.790> get<00:03:48.940> everything<00:03:49.350> sanded<00:03:50.350> once<00:03:51.420> but

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
to once I get everything sanded once but

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:01.009 
to once I get everything sanded once but

too good for the area I'm working on

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.180 
too good for the area I'm working on
that's<00:04:22.570> just<00:04:22.840> too<00:04:23.020> big<00:04:23.169> of<00:04:23.229> a<00:04:23.440> dent<00:04:23.650> and<00:04:23.860> won't

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
that's just too big of a dent and won't

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.219 
that's just too big of a dent and won't
fully<00:04:25.410> adhere<00:04:26.410> to<00:04:26.590> it<00:04:26.740> real<00:04:26.919> good<00:04:27.419> so<00:04:28.419> this<00:04:29.050> was

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229 
fully adhere to it real good so this was

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:30.719 
fully adhere to it real good so this was
the<00:04:29.350> only<00:04:29.380> spot<00:04:29.860> I<00:04:29.890> was<00:04:30.070> able<00:04:30.220> to<00:04:30.400> get<00:04:30.580> it

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
the only spot I was able to get it

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:34.650 
the only spot I was able to get it
actually<00:04:31.479> stuck<00:04:32.010> and<00:04:33.180> even<00:04:34.180> then<00:04:34.330> it<00:04:34.479> wasn't

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
actually stuck and even then it wasn't

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.650 
actually stuck and even then it wasn't
sticking<00:04:35.260> too<00:04:35.470> good<00:04:35.740> because<00:04:36.270> some<00:04:37.270> air<00:04:37.450> is

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
sticking too good because some air is

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.120 
sticking too good because some air is
still<00:04:37.930> getting<00:04:38.229> out<00:04:38.350> and<00:04:38.500> when<00:04:38.620> you<00:04:38.740> pull<00:04:38.950> it

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
still getting out and when you pull it

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.909 
still getting out and when you pull it
real<00:04:39.460> hard<00:04:40.050> it<00:04:41.050> just<00:04:41.110> releases<00:04:41.880> so<00:04:43.890> but<00:04:44.890> I

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
real hard it just releases so but I

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:46.860 
real hard it just releases so but I
think<00:04:45.100> what<00:04:45.430> I'm<00:04:45.520> going<00:04:45.640> to<00:04:45.669> do<00:04:45.820> is<00:04:45.940> just<00:04:46.120> stand

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
think what I'm going to do is just stand

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.100 
think what I'm going to do is just stand
it<00:04:47.080> out<00:04:47.580> put<00:04:48.580> a<00:04:48.610> little<00:04:49.150> bit<00:04:49.300> of<00:04:49.419> bondo<00:04:49.840> on<00:04:49.870> it

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
it out put a little bit of bondo on it

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.810 
it out put a little bit of bondo on it
just<00:04:50.350> to<00:04:50.530> smooth<00:04:50.890> it<00:04:51.039> out<00:04:51.190> a<00:04:51.250> little<00:04:51.430> bit

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
just to smooth it out a little bit

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.750 
just to smooth it out a little bit
leave<00:04:52.060> the<00:04:52.270> dent<00:04:52.510> in<00:04:52.780> just<00:04:53.740> smooth<00:04:54.190> it<00:04:54.370> out<00:04:54.460> and

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
leave the dent in just smooth it out and

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.670 
leave the dent in just smooth it out and
then<00:04:54.940> just<00:04:55.210> paint<00:04:55.419> it<00:04:56.280> and<00:04:57.280> eventually<00:04:57.550> I<00:04:58.680> may

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
then just paint it and eventually I may

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.420 
then just paint it and eventually I may
get<00:04:59.919> another<00:05:00.100> door<00:05:00.430> for<00:05:00.460> it<00:05:02.100> but<00:05:03.100> we'll<00:05:03.280> see

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
get another door for it but we'll see

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.870 
get another door for it but we'll see
how<00:05:03.460> it<00:05:03.610> looks<00:05:03.910> if<00:05:04.510> it<00:05:04.660> looks<00:05:04.870> fallen<00:05:05.470> and<00:05:05.880> good

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
how it looks if it looks fallen and good

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.149 
how it looks if it looks fallen and good
enough<00:05:07.120> then

00:05:08.149 --> 00:05:08.159 
enough then

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:12.409 
enough then
oh<00:05:08.189> well<00:05:09.179> I<00:05:09.479> mean<00:05:09.779> like<00:05:09.899> said<00:05:10.169> this<00:05:10.319> is<00:05:10.499> a<00:05:11.419> I'm

but still you know do it halfway decent

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:24.259 
but still you know do it halfway decent
the<00:05:23.129> main<00:05:23.309> thing<00:05:23.550> is<00:05:23.729> I<00:05:23.849> want<00:05:23.879> to<00:05:24.059> get<00:05:24.149> it

started cleaning some of the walls like
I<00:05:42.749> mentioned<00:05:47.179> cleans<00:05:48.179> up<00:05:48.360> pretty<00:05:48.509> good<00:05:48.599> I

I mentioned cleans up pretty good I

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:50.929 
I mentioned cleans up pretty good I
still<00:05:49.110> got<00:05:49.259> a<00:05:49.289> maybe<00:05:50.279> get<00:05:50.459> some<00:05:50.639> steel<00:05:50.909> wool

00:05:50.929 --> 00:05:50.939

and<00:05:52.189> clean<00:05:53.189> that<00:05:53.399> off<00:05:53.639> it's<00:05:54.209> kind<00:05:54.479> of<00:05:54.569> stuck

00:05:55.179 --> 00:05:55.189 
and clean that off it's kind of stuck

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:59.959 
and clean that off it's kind of stuck
whatever<00:05:56.189> it<00:05:56.550> is<00:05:56.699> but<00:05:58.519> yeah<00:05:59.519> I<00:05:59.550> think<00:05:59.639> I'm

00:05:59.959 --> 00:05:59.969 
whatever it is but yeah I think I'm

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:01.219 
whatever it is but yeah I think I'm
decided<00:06:00.509> I'm<00:06:00.599> probably<00:06:00.809> gonna<00:06:00.990> end<00:06:01.079> up

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:01.229 
decided I'm probably gonna end up

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:03.559 
decided I'm probably gonna end up
painting<00:06:01.499> the<00:06:01.649> walls<00:06:01.860> I<00:06:02.189> didn't<00:06:02.759> want<00:06:02.939> to<00:06:03.119> but

00:06:03.559 --> 00:06:03.569 
painting the walls I didn't want to but

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:09.319 
painting the walls I didn't want to but
I<00:06:04.069> think<00:06:05.069> these<00:06:05.749> just<00:06:06.749> the<00:06:06.929> stains<00:06:07.319> and<00:06:08.329> where

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:09.329 
I think these just the stains and where

00:06:09.329 --> 00:06:13.369 
I think these just the stains and where
it's<00:06:09.449> faded<00:06:09.929> is<00:06:10.110> going<00:06:10.739> to<00:06:11.990> eventually<00:06:12.990> get<00:06:13.319> on

00:06:13.369 --> 00:06:13.379 
it's faded is going to eventually get on

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:18.049 
it's faded is going to eventually get on
my<00:06:13.589> nerves<00:06:14.659> and<00:06:16.399> might<00:06:17.399> as<00:06:17.490> well<00:06:17.639> paint<00:06:17.909> it

00:06:18.049 --> 00:06:18.059 
my nerves and might as well paint it

00:06:18.059 --> 00:06:20.359 
my nerves and might as well paint it
before<00:06:18.509> I<00:06:18.539> get<00:06:18.629> too<00:06:18.869> much<00:06:19.050> stuff<00:06:19.319> in<00:06:19.529> here<00:06:19.740> set

00:06:20.359 --> 00:06:20.369 
before I get too much stuff in here set

00:06:20.369 --> 00:06:23.929 
before I get too much stuff in here set
in<00:06:20.490> place<00:06:22.279> because<00:06:23.279> I<00:06:23.490> don't<00:06:23.669> think<00:06:23.699> it's

00:06:23.929 --> 00:06:23.939 
in place because I don't think it's

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:26.449 
in place because I don't think it's
gonna<00:06:24.059> take<00:06:24.269> about<00:06:24.360> a<00:06:24.479> half<00:06:24.719> a<00:06:24.839> day<00:06:25.309> or<00:06:26.309> a<00:06:26.369> day

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:26.459 
gonna take about a half a day or a day

00:06:26.459 --> 00:06:29.269 
gonna take about a half a day or a day
to<00:06:26.809> to<00:06:27.809> paint<00:06:28.079> it<00:06:28.229> I'm<00:06:28.469> just<00:06:28.740> gonna<00:06:28.919> paint<00:06:29.129> the

00:06:29.269 --> 00:06:29.279 
to to paint it I'm just gonna paint the

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:31.819 
to to paint it I'm just gonna paint the
walls<00:06:29.309> probably<00:06:30.289> not<00:06:31.289> gonna<00:06:31.469> do<00:06:31.559> anything

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:31.829 
walls probably not gonna do anything

00:06:31.829 --> 00:06:35.179 
walls probably not gonna do anything
with<00:06:32.490> the<00:06:32.669> ceiling<00:06:33.119> or<00:06:33.360> these<00:06:33.919> storage<00:06:34.919> bays

00:06:35.179 --> 00:06:35.189 
with the ceiling or these storage bays

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:41.499 
with the ceiling or these storage bays
and<00:06:35.719> I'll<00:06:36.719> leave<00:06:36.929> the<00:06:37.110> front<00:06:37.969> the<00:06:38.969> way<00:06:39.089> it<00:06:39.209> is

00:06:41.499 --> 00:06:41.509 

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:46.519 

it's<00:06:42.509> just<00:06:42.659> going<00:06:42.990> to<00:06:43.079> be<00:06:43.199> those<00:06:45.139> those<00:06:46.139> three

00:06:46.519 --> 00:06:46.529 
it's just going to be those those three

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:56.559 
it's just going to be those those three
walls<00:06:47.269> so<00:06:48.269> I<00:06:51.199> think<00:06:52.199> that<00:06:52.529> is<00:06:52.740> about<00:06:52.949> it<00:06:53.399> for

00:06:56.559 --> 00:06:56.569 

00:06:56.569 --> 00:07:03.739 

this<00:06:57.569> weekend<00:07:01.399> next<00:07:02.399> weekend<00:07:02.969> I<00:07:03.179> probably

00:07:03.739 --> 00:07:03.749 
this weekend next weekend I probably
