00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
nice defensive end on the edge and it's

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.840 
nice defensive end on the edge and it's
gonna<00:01:52.289> be<00:01:52.499> harder<00:01:52.799> for<00:01:52.829> for<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.429> to<00:01:53.609> run<00:01:53.759> the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
gonna be harder for for you to run the

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.389 
gonna be harder for for you to run the
ball<00:01:54.060> like<00:01:54.630> four<00:01:54.840> in<00:01:54.929> case<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.530> money<00:01:55.710> in<00:01:55.890> my

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
ball like four in case of money in my

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.520 
ball like four in case of money in my
case<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.939> love<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.539> run<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.780> ball<00:01:57.960> with

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
case I love to run the ball with

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.370 
case I love to run the ball with
counters<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.189> strong<00:01:59.939> power<00:02:00.210> but<00:02:00.840> because<00:02:01.229> I

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
counters and strong power but because I

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.929 
counters and strong power but because I
can't<00:02:01.679> pass<00:02:01.979> or<00:02:02.249> I<00:02:02.310> don't<00:02:02.460> have<00:02:02.549> that<00:02:02.579> money

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
can't pass or I don't have that money

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.270 
can't pass or I don't have that money
passing<00:02:03.450> play<00:02:03.689> it's<00:02:04.170> tougher<00:02:04.679> for<00:02:04.710> me<00:02:04.920> man

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
passing play it's tougher for me man

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.039 
passing play it's tougher for me man
it's<00:02:05.549> tougher<00:02:05.999> and<00:02:06.240> then<00:02:06.420> that's<00:02:06.810> my<00:02:06.899> fault

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
it's tougher and then that's my fault

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.469 
it's tougher and then that's my fault
because<00:02:07.560> instead<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.340> me<00:02:08.610> starting<00:02:08.880> the<00:02:09.149> the

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
craving gave me some tips on passing and

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.210 
craving gave me some tips on passing and
reading<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.510> defense<00:02:31.050> and<00:02:31.530> some<00:02:31.770> passing

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
reading the defense and some passing

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.070 
reading the defense and some passing
concepts<00:02:32.730> i<00:02:32.880> mean<00:02:33.060> not<00:02:33.510> like<00:02:33.570> I<00:02:33.780> could<00:02:33.990> have

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
concepts i mean not like I could have

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.840 
concepts i mean not like I could have
had<00:02:34.260> before<00:02:34.680> but<00:02:34.860> before<00:02:35.220> I<00:02:35.250> would<00:02:35.490> have<00:02:35.640> a<00:02:35.670> lot

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
had before but before I would have a lot

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.600 
had before but before I would have a lot
of<00:02:35.910> money<00:02:36.060> play<00:02:36.480> so<00:02:36.540> it<00:02:36.780> was<00:02:36.900> easier<00:02:37.230> for<00:02:37.260> me<00:02:37.440> to

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
of money play so it was easier for me to

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.830 
of money play so it was easier for me to
get<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.820> place<00:02:39.390> on<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.750> air<00:02:40.130> done<00:02:41.130> but<00:02:41.430> in

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
get the place on the air done but in

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.590 
get the place on the air done but in
especially<00:02:42.840> here<00:02:43.290> in<00:02:43.410> n<00:02:44.310> beauty<00:02:44.790> it's<00:02:45.000> harder

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
especially here in n beauty it's harder

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.870 
especially here in n beauty it's harder
because<00:02:45.810> you<00:02:46.380> don't<00:02:46.560> have<00:02:46.620> that<00:02:47.160> special

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
because you don't have that special

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.390 
because you don't have that special
money<00:02:48.300> play<00:02:48.600> you<00:02:48.750> don't<00:02:48.900> have<00:02:49.080> the<00:02:49.800> special

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
money play you don't have the special

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.980 
money play you don't have the special
running<00:02:50.700> play<00:02:50.820> that's<00:02:51.000> gonna<00:02:51.150> get<00:02:51.330> you<00:02:51.540> out<00:02:51.690> or

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
running play that's gonna get you out or

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.050 
running play that's gonna get you out or
20<00:02:52.320> yards<00:02:52.620> every<00:02:52.770> single<00:02:53.190> time<00:02:53.400> you<00:02:53.640> know

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
20 yards every single time you know

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.820 
20 yards every single time you know
you're<00:02:54.330> stuck<00:02:54.870> with<00:02:55.050> certain<00:02:55.290> place<00:02:55.560> and

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
you're stuck with certain place and

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.810 
you're stuck with certain place and
that's<00:02:56.340> why<00:02:56.550> you<00:02:56.610> gotta<00:02:56.880> learn<00:02:57.390> how<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:57.690> use<00:02:58.110> a

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
that's why you gotta learn how to use a

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.979 
that's why you gotta learn how to use a
universal<00:02:59.820> concepts<00:03:00.390> that<00:03:00.660> you<00:03:00.810> could<00:03:00.959> use

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
universal concepts that you could use

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.020 
universal concepts that you could use
with<00:03:01.260> any<00:03:01.350> playbook<00:03:01.860> to<00:03:02.040> help<00:03:02.310> you<00:03:02.550> win<00:03:02.760> games

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
with any playbook to help you win games

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.210 
with any playbook to help you win games
and<00:03:03.270> that's<00:03:03.480> what<00:03:03.600> we<00:03:03.690> were<00:03:03.810> lapping<00:03:04.220> last

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
and that's what we were lapping last

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.340 
and that's what we were lapping last
time<00:03:05.489> some<00:03:06.239> of<00:03:06.330> these<00:03:06.390> concepts<00:03:06.840> on<00:03:06.959> defense

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
time some of these concepts on defense

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.810 
time some of these concepts on defense
are<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.590> same<00:03:07.830> I<00:03:08.100> don't<00:03:08.370> matter<00:03:08.610> I<00:03:08.730> mean

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
are the same I don't matter I mean

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.460 
are the same I don't matter I mean
defense<00:03:09.300> is<00:03:09.420> good<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.930> only<00:03:10.110> thing<00:03:10.320> is<00:03:10.350> that

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
defense is good the only thing is that

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.050 
defense is good the only thing is that
if<00:03:10.650> I<00:03:10.770> don't<00:03:10.950> feel<00:03:11.040> country<00:03:11.340> blondie<00:03:11.760> friends

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
if I don't feel country blondie friends

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.940 
if I don't feel country blondie friends
and<00:03:12.180> I<00:03:12.239> had<00:03:12.360> to<00:03:12.480> laugh<00:03:12.630> some<00:03:12.840> defense<00:03:13.320> I<00:03:13.500> won't

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
and I had to laugh some defense I won't

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.229 
and I had to laugh some defense I won't
do<00:03:14.100> anything<00:03:14.370> on<00:03:14.580> offense<00:03:14.700> I<00:03:15.000> don't<00:03:15.150> feel
