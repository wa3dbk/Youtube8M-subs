is<00:00:14.190> gonna<00:00:14.400> be<00:00:14.549> a<00:00:14.580> lot<00:00:14.910> lighter<00:00:15.269> in<00:00:15.450> weight<00:00:15.570> than

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
is gonna be a lot lighter in weight than

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.109 
is gonna be a lot lighter in weight than
the<00:00:16.170> all<00:00:16.289> stainless<00:00:16.830> steel<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.430> also

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
the all stainless steel and also

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.880 
the all stainless steel and also
counters<00:00:18.600> another<00:00:19.020> problem<00:00:19.529> what<00:00:19.859> happens

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
counters another problem what happens

stainless steel that's all completely
mirror<00:00:24.720> polished<00:00:25.170> well<00:00:26.130> it's<00:00:26.460> like<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.609> scratch

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
mirror polished well it's like a scratch

here is the incredible textured dial

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.549 
here is the incredible textured dial
that's<00:00:56.460> an<00:00:56.879> oil<00:00:57.149> press<00:00:57.570> centered<00:00:58.020> dial<00:00:58.320> there

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
that's an oil press centered dial there

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.200 
that's an oil press centered dial there
that<00:00:58.710> gives<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.010> nice<00:00:59.280> texture<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.969> light

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
that gives you a nice texture the light

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.360 
that gives you a nice texture the light
just<00:01:00.510> bounces<00:01:01.109> off<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.770> looks

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
just bounces off of it and looks

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.609 
just bounces off of it and looks
incredible<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.329> looks<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.809> lot<00:01:04.019> more<00:01:04.199> expensive

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
incredible it looks a lot more expensive

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.550 
incredible it looks a lot more expensive
than<00:01:05.250> even<00:01:05.700> our<00:01:05.820> most<00:01:06.420> expensive<00:01:06.960> stainless

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
than even our most expensive stainless

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.679 
than even our most expensive stainless
steel<00:01:07.979> versions<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.729> throttle<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.600> if

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
steel versions of the throttle so if

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:10.850 
steel versions of the throttle so if
you're<00:01:09.810> looking<00:01:09.930> for<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.320> little<00:01:10.439> bit<00:01:10.619> lighter

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
you're looking for a little bit lighter

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.969 
you're looking for a little bit lighter
weight<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.430> near<00:01:12.320> indestructibility<00:01:13.320> you

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
weight and near indestructibility you

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.620 
weight and near indestructibility you
might<00:01:14.159> want<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.400> take<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.640> look<00:01:14.939> at<00:01:15.150> one<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.540> the

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
might want to take a look at one of the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.230 
might want to take a look at one of the
ceramic<00:01:16.290> based<00:01:16.500> variations<00:01:17.220> now<00:01:18.000> here's

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
ceramic based variations now here's

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.390 
ceramic based variations now here's
where<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.570> get<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.750> chance<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:19.320> really<00:01:19.590> see<00:01:19.770> the

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
where you get a chance to really see the

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.490 
where you get a chance to really see the
size<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.090> watch<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.869> as<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.140> mentioned

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
size of the watch and as I mentioned

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.080 
size of the watch and as I mentioned
before<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.890> may<00:01:23.040> only<00:01:23.159> be<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.430> forty<00:01:23.820> six

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
before it may only be a forty six

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.270 
before it may only be a forty six
millimeter<00:01:24.570> but<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.869> looks<00:01:25.170> more<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:25.860> guess

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
millimeter but it looks more I guess

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.770 
millimeter but it looks more I guess
like<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.460> forty<00:01:26.939> seven<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.390> forty<00:01:27.750> eight

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
like a forty seven to forty eight

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.050 
like a forty seven to forty eight
millimeter<00:01:28.350> because<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.220> wide<00:01:29.460> bracelet

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
millimeter because of that wide bracelet

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.270 
millimeter because of that wide bracelet
and<00:01:30.210> because<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.200> being<00:01:31.380> made<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.740> ceramic

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
and because of it being made of ceramic

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.800 
and because of it being made of ceramic
it's<00:01:32.430> gonna<00:01:32.549> be<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.729> lot<00:01:33.000> lighter<00:01:33.299> weight<00:01:33.420> than

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
it's gonna be a lot lighter weight than

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.170 
it's gonna be a lot lighter weight than
our<00:01:33.930> stainless<00:01:34.290> steel<00:01:34.520> original<00:01:35.520> counterpart

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
our stainless steel original counterpart

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.929 
our stainless steel original counterpart
it<00:01:36.780> looks<00:01:37.110> slick<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.799> looks<00:01:38.159> expensive<00:01:38.460> and

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
it looks slick it looks expensive and

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.660 
it looks slick it looks expensive and
that<00:01:39.000> new<00:01:39.689> oil<00:01:39.990> press<00:01:40.439> dial<00:01:40.799> really<00:01:41.220> sets<00:01:41.520> it

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
that new oil press dial really sets it

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.880 
that new oil press dial really sets it
apart<00:01:41.759> from<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.210> crowd<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:42.840> after<00:01:43.560> getting<00:01:43.710> a

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
apart from the crowd so after getting a

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.440 
apart from the crowd so after getting a
chance<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.280> see<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.640> on<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.939> wrist<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.329> little

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
chance to see it on the wrist a little

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.510 
chance to see it on the wrist a little
bit<00:01:45.630> hopefully<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.170> get<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.350> better<00:01:46.649> idea<00:01:46.799> of

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
bit hopefully you get a better idea of

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.090 
bit hopefully you get a better idea of

just how big this watch can look it may
only<00:01:50.220> be<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.490> forty<00:01:50.880> six<00:01:51.149> millimeter<00:01:51.630> but<00:01:51.780> it

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899
