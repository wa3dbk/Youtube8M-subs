getting<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.439> level<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.100> upgrade<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:11.670> those

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
getting that level to upgrade so those

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:12.950 
getting that level to upgrade so those

popped<00:01:20.100> by<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.700> planetary<00:01:21.210> fortress<00:01:21.540> so

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
popped by that planetary fortress so

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.710 
popped by that planetary fortress so
down<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:22.080> goes<00:01:22.229> taking<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.920> look<00:01:23.040> at<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.189> income

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
down it goes taking a look at the income

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.740 
down it goes taking a look at the income
1700<00:01:24.720> versus<00:01:25.140> 1600<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:26.009> fairly<00:01:26.340> even<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.390> most

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
1700 versus 1600 so fairly even and most

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.660 
1700 versus 1600 so fairly even and most

likely caused by the use of these mules

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.149

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
working out as nearly as well as he

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.150 
working out as nearly as well as he
hoped<00:03:00.750> taking<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.530> look<00:03:01.650> over<00:03:01.920> here<00:03:02.040> they

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
hoped taking a look over here they

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.370 
hoped taking a look over here they
muslims<00:03:02.579> all<00:03:02.820> three<00:03:03.180> or<00:03:03.420> all<00:03:03.450> six<00:03:04.019> of<00:03:04.170> these

muslims all three or all six of these
medevacs<00:03:04.829> are<00:03:04.980> very<00:03:05.220> very<00:03:05.459> low<00:03:05.730> on<00:03:05.910> energy<00:03:06.090> but

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
medevacs are very very low on energy but

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.210 
medevacs are very very low on energy but
it<00:03:06.989> still<00:03:07.200> seems<00:03:07.440> to<00:03:07.590> be<00:03:07.709> enough<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.069> really

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
it still seems to be enough to really

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.770 
it still seems to be enough to really
continue<00:03:08.579> this<00:03:08.819> fight<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:09.150> finish<00:03:09.480> up<00:03:09.630> the
