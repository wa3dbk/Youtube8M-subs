00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 hello kids I'm again progress g7 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.069
 commenting and today I bring you what 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.480
 allows the previous life of how it 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.900
 install in process in a way the 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.780
 helmets on ps3 the glimpse you know 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.210
 you first thing 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.250
 we removed the old helmets that I eat 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.980
 You see, they were crap after we had a 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.690
 wireless but I do not know what the hell happened 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.720
 I know that we take away the old 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:31.480
 for the old and good the first thing that 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.950
 we have to do is this comes 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.930
 these headphones 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.020
 headset find commission like that 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.570
 they are just to talk 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.290
 to see that these are for license plates 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.290
 honor is only 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.170
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.750
 where we went in and his famous I think 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.140
 that this pretty easy but good gray 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.140
 with gray 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:02.620
 now this would plug it into the play 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.540
 but at the moment it 's like values ​​upside down 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.290
 or this way 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.420
 good is already 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:14.979
 LOL 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.980
 it's not worth this is at all for 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:23.550
 connect them 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:27.260
 and well I do not know what the truth is for 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.260
 to see if you can do it you know 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.810
 knows more or less why 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.500
 but for xbox it's really the forgiveness that 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.860
 I forgot these matches for 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.229
 hook it from here where I was 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.869
 I understand the command to raise my hand 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.399
 that is here would suck us and from here to 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:51.360
 I command the xbox I forgot sorry 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:54.650
 sorry and hey he pays me two children and 3 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.650
 I do not know if it will look good 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:03.000
 now it's basically catching the cables from 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:06.060
 play and unplug the red and the 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.750
 white only and it comes to you and these are 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.750
 those that come to you 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:17.680
 fuck in the microphone then plug in 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:17.680
 red with red yes and white with white 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.990
 and now we plug the target with the 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.760
 white as it was before white with 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.099
 White 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:31.620
 and red with red I think it gets complicated 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:34.980
 now let's see a little bit the turn and 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.409
 we are connected to this and then we 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.420
 the wires I will not put back and everything 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:44.400
 because if you see they are almost three meters 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:47.420
 4a and cable and now the basics to scratch 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.459
 for the headset to work 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.660
 we're not going to adjust with the screen by 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.910
 favor 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.490
 settings where they were adjusting 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.640
 accessories 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:01.490
 we go to settings of the device 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.370
 audio since we put it and we give it 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:06.080
 access and we see that we get a 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.580
 little man of microphones we have bought 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:12.320
 in this case the estu service call of 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:15.350
 duty and if especially I do not know what ok and already 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.440
 I would be the best if we want to do 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.440
 example 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.990
 to see if it works I do not like to 

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:25.140
 no site 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:29.930
 we would be the micro we occupy and some 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:33.409
 times and we see that it works so 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:38.900
 only this and then and these 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:40.909
 levers are both then expansion if 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.430
 it's on if you just want 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:45.490
 micro or to get in and mutes 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.100
 say to him is he 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:51.190
 is silent now it's on 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:54.790
 we leave the silence pampered mind this is 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:57.520
 for itself the dream of the television we turned it off 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.410
 we turn it on and then I'm here to 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.030
 regulate the sound this is to regulate 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.160
 the sound of the game 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.600
 for the clock to the sound of the chat to carry 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:10.460
 little to see the light 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:12.850
 for right when the game and this already 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.850
 It is for 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:19.010
 the main woman's helmets like that 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:22.070
 how good this has been all there 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.340
 liked and vote her that favorites and up 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.340
 the next
