00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:18.640
 well let's make a donut 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.500
 morcilla I think we all know how to make 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.480
 an oven we have all made an oven 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.630
 some prawns gabardines and what I want 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.060
 is to make a skewer with the blade but 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.520
 special and for that we are going to make a 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.890
 black pudding cream that we need then 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.950
 We need onion black pudding that 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.329
 we will puncture and we will make them in the oven what 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.070
 The only thing we have to do is to take them 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.989
 the skin and catch all that is meat 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.880
 of the grilled blood sausage that we will mix 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.850
 with caramelized onions and 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.610
 Butter and trituramos 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.930
 we will get a fine cream a cream 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.120
 that the moment we put it to 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.620
 cool will take consistency by the 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.989
 butter and the body that has 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.000
 then I simply recommend what 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.920
 next we have the options to do them 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.500
 in the moment as I am going to do them 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.340
 now or at a given time 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:09.210
 As you can see we can to freeze 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.890
 do the production one day of the week 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.210
 beat them and have them freeze the cndh 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.400
 the only difference is going to be the 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.460
 next and now when I 'm going to do what 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.830
 which is the donut if it were frozen 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.720
 you just have to bring it in, leave it 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.250
 defrost and finish it in the oven and 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.330
 in this case what we are going to do is a 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.369
 Direct frying is sealed in the bowl 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.690
 of the dough oven and just 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:37.240
 wrap it well 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.240
 and fry the one 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.030
 and 2 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.230
 the would be a 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.150
 we have to know that at the moment 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.640
 the cream is going to heat the donut 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:04.090
 it is becoming much more liquid and creamy 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.159
 we leave it here and we're just going to 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.510
 put it in the following way to me 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.880
 I usually like to accompany him with a 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.509
 cream of pears roasted then we put it 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.509
 on the plate 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.930
 we put a donut 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.930
 and the other good 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.060
 and there we have the black pudding wine 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.310
 do not
