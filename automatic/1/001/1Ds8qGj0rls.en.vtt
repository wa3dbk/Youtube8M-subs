00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
make fire by friction we'll see how it

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.840 
make fire by friction we'll see how it
works<00:00:43.590> I<00:00:43.890> didn't<00:00:44.100> spend<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.309> whole<00:00:44.340> lot<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.579> time

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
here is when I make my drill one thing

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.420 
here is when I make my drill one thing
that<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.510> found<00:01:00.719> this<00:01:00.930> helpful<00:01:01.170> for<00:01:01.500> me<00:01:01.680> and

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
that I found this helpful for me and

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.979 
that I found this helpful for me and
everybody<00:01:02.609> might<00:01:03.000> not<00:01:03.030> prefer<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:03.660> but<00:01:03.930> I

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
everybody might not prefer this but I

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.390 
everybody might not prefer this but I
kind<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.229> like<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.409> keep<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.830> big<00:01:05.070> at<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.369> end

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
kind of like to keep it big at the end

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.760 
kind of like to keep it big at the end
and<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:06.390> make<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.689> smaller<00:01:07.020> at<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.350> top<00:01:07.560> but

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
and I make it smaller at the top but

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.440 
and I make it smaller at the top but
what<00:01:07.950> happens<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.430> prevents<00:01:09.000> my<00:01:09.119> string

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
what happens is that prevents my string

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.990 
what happens is that prevents my string
from<00:01:09.720> running<00:01:10.080> down<00:01:10.229> my<00:01:10.439> drill

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
from running down my drill

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.980 
from running down my drill
so<00:01:12.000> whenever<00:01:14.450> whenever<00:01:15.450> you're<00:01:15.630> running<00:01:15.900> that

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
so whenever whenever you're running that

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.660 
so whenever whenever you're running that
both<00:01:16.229> back<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.710> forth<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.100> string<00:01:17.430> has<00:01:17.640> a

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
both back and forth that string has a

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.030 
both back and forth that string has a
tendency<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.240> start<00:01:18.479> slipping<00:01:18.960> down<00:01:19.170> which

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
tendency to start slipping down which

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.950 
tendency to start slipping down which
becomes<00:01:20.400> aggravating<00:01:21.000> but<00:01:21.119> if<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.420> if<00:01:21.810> you

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
becomes aggravating but if you if you

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.010 
becomes aggravating but if you if you
give<00:01:22.140> your<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:23.070> give<00:01:23.220> your<00:01:23.400> drill<00:01:24.030> here<00:01:24.360> just<00:01:24.900> a

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
give your to give your drill here just a

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.660 
give your to give your drill here just a
little<00:01:25.259> bit<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.560> slant<00:01:25.890> down<00:01:26.250> like<00:01:26.490> that

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
little bit of a slant down like that

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.090 
little bit of a slant down like that
it'll<00:01:27.030> keep<00:01:27.180> your<00:01:27.299> string<00:01:27.600> in<00:01:27.720> place<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.380> for

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100

through trying this over and over again
that<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:32.939> found<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.299> be<00:01:33.420> helpful<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.350> thought

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
have a piece of birch here it's pretty

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.920 
have a piece of birch here it's pretty
flexible<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.910> I'm<00:02:09.030> using<00:02:09.180> paracord

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
my spark should I be able to make one I

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:32.180 
my spark should I be able to make one I
might<00:02:23.220> use<00:02:23.400> some<00:02:23.580> cut

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.820 

that<00:02:33.000> should<00:02:33.240> work

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
that should work

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.260 
that should work
very

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270

let's<00:02:37.900> get<00:02:38.050> started<00:02:39.780> this<00:02:40.780> will<00:02:40.930> probably

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
let's get started this will probably

00:02:41.080 --> 00:03:40.850 
let's get started this will probably
take<00:02:41.260> a<00:02:41.380> minute

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:05:18.760 

all<00:03:41.860> right

you<00:05:26.680> guys<00:05:26.860> could<00:05:27.070> see<00:05:27.220> that<00:05:27.370> good<00:05:29.970> alright

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
you guys could see that good alright

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.740 
you guys could see that good alright
fire<00:05:31.300> by<00:05:31.510> friction<00:05:32.760> of<00:05:33.760> course<00:05:34.060> with<00:05:34.510> the<00:05:34.630> aid

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
fire by friction of course with the aid

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.129 
fire by friction of course with the aid
of<00:05:34.780> a<00:05:34.930> cotton<00:05:35.229> ball<00:05:35.380> to<00:05:36.270> catch<00:05:37.270> but<00:05:37.780> I<00:05:37.930> keep

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:38.139 
of a cotton ball to catch but I keep

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:40.129 
of a cotton ball to catch but I keep
cotton<00:05:38.440> balls<00:05:38.590> in<00:05:38.770> my<00:05:38.860> fire<00:05:39.040> kit<00:05:39.280> anyhow

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139 
cotton balls in my fire kit anyhow

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:45.230 
cotton balls in my fire kit anyhow
alright<00:05:41.639> so<00:05:42.639> there<00:05:42.820> you<00:05:42.850> go<00:05:43.060> fire<00:05:43.570> by<00:05:43.780> friction

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
alright so there you go fire by friction

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:51.040 
alright so there you go fire by friction
thank<00:05:46.240> you<00:05:46.330> guys<00:05:46.479> for<00:05:46.660> watching
