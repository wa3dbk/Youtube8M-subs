00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.080
 hello today we will see how 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.360
 very much a cover on a wall in 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.830
 masonry is well damaged that has been 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.599
 already taken a little bit partially 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.860
 turn in the end so here we see how 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.110
 plug the holes and then then 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.860
 remake a clean coat first phase 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.860
 cleaning 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:30.440
 how of iron stretched after the end then 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:33.500
 remove everything that was 2 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:37.100
 overthickness they will prevent us by 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:43.670
 team to lose in the name of own yet 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:45.320
 langer teacher it goes everywhere she 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.820
 can also bring down what is a 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:52.100
 little weak on the edges the first 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.409
 step will consist of making a mortar to 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:59.570
 lime so sand gravel the horses 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:00.890
 and we're gonna block these groups that we have 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.510
 well cleaned on the other hand over 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.059
 dust is nothing more it's more 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.400
 to clean with a karcher and we're going 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.930
 so plug this hole by putting some 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.930
 mortar and stones to fill 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:22.090
 so for the proportions go see 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.090
 which he is sure but under construction 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.810
 so for large quantities have 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.780
 stirred up the call for small 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:35.690
 quantities like that we can do it with 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:37.880
 a trowel there we will make a mortar 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.899
 a little fat for that sticks well and then 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.460
 especially a little bit so that when we 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:46.750
 freelance in the funds is not 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.750
 tendency to conceal 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:53.179
 for example I have not hurt but I stone 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.360
 have prepared them and I make them soaked 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:59.090
 to better adhere to my mortar 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.509
 lime and then I'll see 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:09.519
 take a place so I'm going 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:13.540
 to compensate a keeper by spreading well 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:13.540
 see while projecting to the trunk 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:24.489
 the hole to finish well 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:24.489
 market at schl 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:41.470
 and then I went in 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.470
 in strength 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:56.290
 I repeat the same operation with my 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.290
 hot market 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.780
 so a little thing is when you 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.980
 have well trimmed like that at the beginning I 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.459
 advise you to stop 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:14.030
 when you see it starts to be good 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.790
 full like that remind you a little bit and 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.709
 let you take a moment 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.940
 except that if you charge too much if 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.490
 you are trying to catch up with the level of a 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.720
 only blow that will pull all the matter 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.860
 he had a chance out of two that everything 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:30.140
 then falls back to apply your 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.450
 mortar we made two movements 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.150
 really distinct the one projected as 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.400
 that pretty violently with really the 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.470
 wrist shot that will allow you to 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.769
 do well apply on areas a 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.780
 shallow as this and then you 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:50.120
 have the other possibility it's from 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:52.220
 to charge all the places 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:58.519
 a little more funky even a big garni 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:04:02.989
 Here we are, let's go 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:05.390
 near a day so lime kaunas to 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.579
 seniors i'm starting to have hardened good 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.200
 okay not completely hard starts to 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:11.440
 shoot 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:16.729
 and then there he will wet a little bit 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:19.420
 the wall emitted dufry all that and then 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:21.310
 especially we will do 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.260
 the last pass to make some 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.840
 pretty much clean thing unlike 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.940
 to yesterday where we made a passage with 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.760
 lime concrete ie gravels 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:34.360
 sand and delachaux there today 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:38.620
 we're just going to do a projection with 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:45.150
 sand and lime that goes into a 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:45.150
 first time and needed like that 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.040
 since there we want little thickness 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.840
 not having gravel in it 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.840
 it's still going to be a big advantage 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:11.710
 so we crush well for now I'm 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:22.170
 am not too disappointed rep and sisters by the 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:22.170
 suite so once I quickly 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.010
 I floated 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:32.210
 to smooth my lime plaster and 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.970
 then here at the small holes right at 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:38.620
 left I'm going to relish like that little to 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:41.960
 little until my coating swap the 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.789
 here she listened we will see the result 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.129
 I hope it will help you 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:48.639
 plug the holes in your walls go 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:48.639
 good and c
