this artwork in creating it was learning

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.870

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
of oil paints and then working a way to

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.040 
of oil paints and then working a way to
get<00:00:26.029> the<00:00:26.270> prism<00:00:27.169> look<00:00:27.410> and<00:00:28.360> the<00:00:29.360> process<00:00:29.840> was

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
get the prism look and the process was

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.510 
get the prism look and the process was
lying<00:00:30.380> to<00:00:30.619> me<00:00:30.739> because<00:00:30.860> it's<00:00:31.070> my<00:00:31.099> first<00:00:31.430> time

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
and I got halfway through and wish I'd

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.380 
and I got halfway through and wish I'd
never<00:00:35.090> started<00:00:35.239> it<00:00:36.250> but<00:00:37.250> when<00:00:37.429> I<00:00:37.460> got<00:00:37.730> done<00:00:37.969> and
