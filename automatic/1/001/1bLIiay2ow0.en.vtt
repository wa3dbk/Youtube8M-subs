uh by most of the pyramids here there's
a<00:00:12.269> little<00:00:12.530> small<00:00:13.530> angle<00:00:14.070> tried<00:00:15.030> spinning

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
a little small angle tried spinning

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.560 
a little small angle tried spinning
attack<00:00:15.780> into<00:00:16.080> it<00:00:16.789> if<00:00:17.789> you<00:00:17.940> notice<00:00:18.210> when<00:00:18.359> you<00:00:18.449> do

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
attack into it if you notice when you do

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.390 
attack into it if you notice when you do
it<00:00:18.690> you<00:00:18.750> kind<00:00:18.960> of<00:00:19.020> go<00:00:19.199> up<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.830> wall<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.039> little

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
it you kind of go up the wall a little

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.320 
it you kind of go up the wall a little
bit<00:00:21.740> somewhat<00:00:22.740> of<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:22.949> glitch<00:00:23.189> if<00:00:23.880> you<00:00:24.060> want<00:00:24.240> to

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
bit somewhat of a glitch if you want to

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.240 
bit somewhat of a glitch if you want to
experiment<00:00:24.720> with<00:00:24.960> it<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.199> little<00:00:25.380> more<00:00:25.680> you<00:00:26.099> can

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
experiment with it a little more you can

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.240 
experiment with it a little more you can
try<00:00:26.810> so<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:27.840> found<00:00:28.380> no<00:00:28.800> real<00:00:29.960> significance<00:00:31.250> to

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
try so I found no real significance to

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.750 
try so I found no real significance to
it<00:00:33.410> anyway<00:00:34.410> let's<00:00:34.710> just<00:00:34.950> continue<00:00:35.190> our<00:00:35.579> way

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
it anyway let's just continue our way

here around the isle of ruin here we are
coming<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.550> big<00:00:53.820> temple<00:00:55.129> muchos<00:00:56.129> temple<00:00:56.610> I

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
coming to the big temple muchos temple I

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.799 
coming to the big temple muchos temple I
do<00:00:56.760> believe<00:00:57.090> it's<00:00:57.329> called<00:00:59.239> and<00:01:00.239> when<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.780> look

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
there two sides I bet you can just guess

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.780 
there two sides I bet you can just guess
what's<00:01:03.870> coming<00:01:04.110> on<00:01:05.960> yep<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.380> were<00:01:07.409> right

you do it this way look at that we're in
the<00:01:20.220> little<00:01:20.430> green<00:01:20.580> thing<00:01:20.880> found<00:01:21.869> no<00:01:22.110> real

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
the little green thing found no real

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.030 
the little green thing found no real
significance<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.369> other<00:01:23.729> than<00:01:24.890> kind<00:01:25.890> of

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
significance to it other than kind of

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.390 
significance to it other than kind of
hard<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.310> get<00:01:26.549> out<00:01:26.759> um<00:01:30.860> and<00:01:31.860> when<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.130> throw<00:01:32.340> a

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
found a few more glitches yes I love

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.240 
found a few more glitches yes I love
glitches<00:01:56.700> they're<00:01:56.939> so<00:01:57.119> cool<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:58.430> show<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.490> 10

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
glitches they're so cool so show you 10

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.280 
glitches they're so cool so show you 10
right<00:02:02.250> by<00:02:02.430> astronauts<00:02:03.210> right<00:02:03.990> in<00:02:04.079> this<00:02:04.170> corner

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
right by astronauts right in this corner

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.710 
right by astronauts right in this corner
here<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:04.829> can<00:02:04.979> see<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.280> angle<00:02:07.340> pretty<00:02:08.340> cool

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
here you can see the angle pretty cool

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.600 
here you can see the angle pretty cool
kind<00:02:09.720> of<00:02:09.840> like<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.080> 100k<00:02:10.649> you<00:02:11.099> can<00:02:11.250> either<00:02:11.370> go

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
kind of like the 100k you can either go

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.940 
kind of like the 100k you can either go
through<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.970> wall<00:02:12.090> or<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:13.260> can

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
through the wall or you can

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.009 
through the wall or you can
jump<00:02:14.520> over<00:02:14.790> kind<00:02:15.120> of<00:02:15.239> like<00:02:15.330> that<00:02:16.879> so<00:02:18.019> there's

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
jump over kind of like that so there's

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:30.080 
jump over kind of like that so there's
one<00:02:19.440> of<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.650> glitches<00:02:26.450> yep<00:02:27.680> and<00:02:28.680> then<00:02:29.580> if<00:02:29.760> we

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
one of the glitches yep and then if we

00:02:30.090 --> 00:03:04.070 
one of the glitches yep and then if we
move<00:02:30.330> on<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.900> temple

if<00:03:44.470> you<00:03:44.590> do<00:03:44.739> it<00:03:44.890> right<00:03:45.070> but<00:03:47.610> connect<00:03:48.610> those<00:03:48.880> two

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
if you do it right but connect those two

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.140 
if you do it right but connect those two
swing<00:03:50.050> back<00:03:50.260> about<00:03:50.530> right<00:03:50.830> there<00:03:51.100> and<00:03:51.580> then

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
swing back about right there and then

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.510 
swing back about right there and then
you're<00:03:52.450> on<00:03:52.570> the<00:03:52.750> purple<00:03:53.200> stuff<00:03:53.440> again<00:03:53.830> pretty

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
you're on the purple stuff again pretty

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:00.780 
you're on the purple stuff again pretty
cool<00:03:56.580> and<00:03:58.110> it<00:03:59.110> seems<00:03:59.410> to<00:03:59.709> be<00:03:59.739> that<00:04:00.160> when<00:04:00.610> you

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
cool and it seems to be that when you

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:08.610 
cool and it seems to be that when you
fall<00:04:01.170> you'll<00:04:02.170> fall<00:04:02.800> but<00:04:03.900> rather<00:04:07.290> it<00:04:08.290> appears

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
fall you'll fall but rather it appears

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:20.009 
fall you'll fall but rather it appears
to<00:04:08.680> be<00:04:08.769> quite<00:04:08.980> solid<00:04:13.890> strange<00:04:18.450> and<00:04:19.450> there's

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
to be quite solid strange and there's

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.860 
to be quite solid strange and there's
our<00:04:20.260> other<00:04:20.470> two<00:04:20.769> glitches<00:04:21.340> well<00:04:22.330> thank<00:04:22.720> you
