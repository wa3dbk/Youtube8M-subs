00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:08.970
 hello friends I want to tell you today 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:09.860
 how are the beer houses here 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.460
 kegs 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:17.740
 I use them 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:21.580
 buying used for storage of wine 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:24.520
 more precisely they make champagne in them 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.470
 here is an open cake 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:30.220
 not everyone knows 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:37.360
 how he opened up really complicated 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:38.820
 there is nothing here for this we need 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:44.550
 only 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:50.050
 pipe wrench 2 mount or just 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:53.980
 two pieces of metal any such more 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:57.040
 less strong to me is for the future not so 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:00.970
 here we have an open tank here we have 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:07.860
 closed cake now I'll show how he 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:10.830
 opens and so we take the adjustable wrench 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.460
 that's done to the maximum 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:18.540
 this is for this type of traffic jams 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.650
 Well, let's start to open grab 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.650
 our tube 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.210
 [applause] 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:35.799
 woman 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:39.030
 I already started the series 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.030
 a slight hiss 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:52.000
 it is very important that you when opening 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:56.940
 kega heard the same began to hiss and all the gases 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.940
 who have accumulated there or remained 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:48.400
 come out close it happens rarely but 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:52.860
 It was just now we will have 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.860
 honestly still not this laying 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.090
 but we finished 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.710
 [music] 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.439
 [applause] 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:45.720
 [music] 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.720
 [laugh] 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.909
 [music] 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:13.100
 here passed the air thank god that there 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:17.850
 there is a tongue 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:20.600
 I'll show here he is a tongue in this everywhere 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.600
 dude it 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:30.110
 which but the tone of this case is not 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:33.600
 gave off this traffic jam 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.600
 [laugh] 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.030
 now the air is bleeding 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:51.389
 Well, in principle, remains 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:51.389
 just wait for the page 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:58.500
 the next operation we two people 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:01.220
 take let's say from one mount there 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.220
 or whatever 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.270
 [music] 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:07.270
 other side second 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:14.850
 principle, not much effort is worth now 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:21.300
 two parts like this 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:25.300
 pushing it easy to choke and remove 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:30.419
 here it is the snow mechanisms then it 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:33.850
 should impeller and trimmed and already possible 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:37.740
 use this sideways twist 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:42.000
 spin the cake you have you too 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.000
 quietly open close
