 Hello everyone, steve is the last 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:14.290
 part of the guide how to build a beautiful house in 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:17.400
 minecraft game and so in general before 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:20.169
 how do i start i want to tell you that 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.689
 decorating the house everyone should 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:26.050
 make yourself more comfortable for him where 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.939
 what room thing will be here 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.769
 but I'll show you just examples and 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.290
 maybe some of these ways 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:34.930
 you will use when you will 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:38.440
 build your house so let's start from the first 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:43.030
 the very first thing we put a picture 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:46.600
 one here over the fireplace it's just like that 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:51.670
 more beautiful it turns out so now we take 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:53.620
 chests and put them here in these places to god 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.680
 a place 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.809
 there means such warehouses are small here 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.620
 Immediately you can see that in the window there 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:04.720
 it goes like this then with the glass 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.259
 we run him stairs I just tried 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.560
 now it just makes it so beautiful 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:10.560
 view 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:19.650
 so in general, let's work on the job 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:22.120
 take place to start and put 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:26.800
 workbenches and matches very workbench and 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:31.540
 stoves so we put several stoves at once 2 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:33.490
 and one here and here and put the 1 workbench 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.590
 here we will be with you 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:41.070
 a refrigerator and so for her to us 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:45.840
 need iron door this first 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:48.320
 then the distributor here he is 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.320
 farther 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.900
 iron blocks 2 here one must 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.730
 you can even make stone 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:03.310
 iron somehow beautiful looks 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:06.610
 Well, another button but also the food that you 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.920
 you will go there and put it 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.160
 Distributor here 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:15.540
 about him an iron block then come here 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:19.540
 so we put the iron door 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.790
 so here it is, and here on the sides too 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:26.250
 its iron blocks even so big 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:29.140
 but it is convenient to use it so stop 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.190
 he is in the wrong direction hiding well 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:36.400
 it doesn't matter there already 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.110
 lay for example go here and so he 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.020
 gives you so generally very convenient 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.630
 instead to climb there a chest but it 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.100
 if he's under zero on just go 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.459
 so in general here with the workplace and 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.550
 gathered so now you can here 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:54.430
 put just such a bullshit 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.859
 well type 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:01.280
 how to say well, how would the kitchen 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:04.129
 looked more beautiful there can be placed 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.510
 already potted flowers just put 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.909
 any rugs but or 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.099
 here there instead of one of these plates 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:12.019
 let's just put the stove here 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.909
 but it doesnâ€™t matter 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.889
 figure out how you can be more comfortable 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:19.159
 In general, it's not all set but I always 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:21.980
 I put my houses in excellent places 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:25.810
 different stoves so now let 's do it 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:31.450
 bedrooms and for that we will need 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:37.340
 wool blocks then where are these carpets 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:41.540
 white carpets here and the bed itself 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:43.329
 how did we start it like this 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.409
 all perimeter 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:52.180
 always 2 blocks normal blocks of wool 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:54.640
 then we put beds in these places and 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.400
 already 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.410
 the remaining space in the room is just like that 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.280
 it is no longer possible to lay the carpet so soft 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:05.080
 the bedroom is getting cross over here 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.709
 You can also put different flowers in 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.300
 pots well or 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.250
 but heads there are any creeps but 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.250
 it is optional and it seems like 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:18.250
 if such a large sofa's 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.560
 which you can sleep in general from the bedroom 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.180
 we, too, basically figured out I did not 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.340
 showing how to put these pots there 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.960
 just not too lazy to climb behind them here and in 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.720
 Basically, you yourself will figure it out 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:32.230
 where better to put so here with this place 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.120
 and so here in general there is such a stone floor 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:37.030
 we are not very beautiful looking too 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:40.390
 cover with any carpet but preferably 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.460
 some so well, so that's turquoise 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:47.009
 such a dark color was to at least a little 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:50.820
 as if combined by the floor itself 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:53.750
 well, just to look beautiful 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.750
 here 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.920
 well here in the middle let's say here 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.870
 such a 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.090
 and 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.130
 as it is impossible to put there, but I think everything 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:06.330
 it doesn't matter anymore that all the differences 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.980
 put so well and with the balcony I already there 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.430
 everything else was showing how to do this 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:12.890
 table 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:15.270
 torch how to put better here in general 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:18.080
 here by the way, too, can be somewhere 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:22.040
 put mats when you enter let's say 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:25.400
 well let's say let 's not put everything 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:28.210
 here and so there are no jokes 2 and now let's say 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.210
 in front of the fireplace 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.330
 there is no longer here to put the red course 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:39.650
 in general, these carpets added so steeper became 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:42.259
 play here let's say yes so 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.690
 in general, well, the first floor is partly ready 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:46.580
 new 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:48.919
 add your stuff there survival but 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.750
 what other things still need to leave them 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:53.840
 there are a lot of empty seats here 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:56.449
 places in the center so I will not be there all sorts 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:59.570
 things just don't do now i will show how 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:01.460
 make enchantment so now we 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:06.229
 let's start building enchanted 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:09.860
 so immediately set yourself enchant il not 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:11.080
 this block here and start around about 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.419
 tigo building 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:18.390
 what's the one block of emptiness like there 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:21.240
 stayed here 

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:23.250
 I close here with us in principle here 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:28.200
 there are still places to go there and 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:30.540
 all this you build in a circle this 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.730
 it will still be like if you play just 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:36.000
 in creative times then the settings for 

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:39.080
 Beauty can do it but the library 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.080
 it is not very important 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:45.289
 and so in general, so it was possible 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:48.680
 We start to make the ceiling with bookshelves 

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:55.280
 I don't know why it's not necessary anymore 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:58.990
 here I am so general we did yes 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.990
 By the way better to remove the ceiling seems to me 

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:05.360
 here at the park can be set to not 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:08.180
 you can see the threshold so in general with this side 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.890
 we dealt here I think nothing 

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:14.360
 do not just pave 

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:18.420
 some kind of carpet is that the place is very 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:20.490
 not enough to put some blocks here 

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:22.140
 nothing on the balcony too 

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:25.790
 because it is too small and 

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:30.270
 by the way here before you leave, put the flowers 

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:32.010
 it will be very nice too well in general everything 

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:34.080
 I showed you just about how 

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:37.260
 of course make a site like that in general and 

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:38.880
 the ability to decorate but in general 

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:42.180
 Some things with this you can very 

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:45.300
 help there desires on play well here 

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:47.340
 general now i'm finishing in general 

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.240
 subscribe to the channel put likes 

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.520
 write comments 

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:53.570
 I will be glad to any estimates but was with you 

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.570
