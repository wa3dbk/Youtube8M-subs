00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
recommend wrapping it all the way around

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.440 
recommend wrapping it all the way around
I<00:02:03.470> mean<00:02:04.040> I<00:02:04.070> guess<00:02:04.400> you<00:02:04.640> could<00:02:04.820> do<00:02:04.940> that<00:02:05.090> if<00:02:05.299> you

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
I mean I guess you could do that if you

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.040 
I mean I guess you could do that if you
really<00:02:05.659> wanted<00:02:06.220> but<00:02:07.220> uh<00:02:07.250> I<00:02:07.939> don't<00:02:08.600> know<00:02:08.810> that

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
really wanted but uh I don't know that

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.749 
really wanted but uh I don't know that
just<00:02:09.289> seems<00:02:09.500> like<00:02:09.679> it<00:02:09.890> would<00:02:10.009> get<00:02:10.160> annoying<00:02:10.429> to

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
just seems like it would get annoying to

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:16.090 
just seems like it would get annoying to
me<00:02:11.830> but<00:02:12.830> uh<00:02:13.120> you<00:02:14.120> can<00:02:14.440> kind<00:02:15.440> of<00:02:15.560> see<00:02:15.800> how<00:02:15.890> it's

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
me but uh you can kind of see how it's

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.390 
me but uh you can kind of see how it's
gonna<00:02:16.190> fit<00:02:16.580> try<00:02:17.420> to<00:02:17.480> get<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:18.050> cloth<00:02:18.950> right

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
gonna fit try to get the cloth right

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.390 
gonna fit try to get the cloth right
there<00:02:19.730> on<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:20.060> edge<00:02:20.680> you<00:02:21.680> can<00:02:21.800> staple<00:02:22.280> it<00:02:22.370> down

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
there on the edge you can staple it down

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:35.280 
there on the edge you can staple it down
and<00:02:25.090> keep<00:02:26.090> it<00:02:26.239> there

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.649 

doesn't<00:02:36.099> really<00:02:36.219> matter<00:02:36.489> if<00:02:36.730> it<00:02:36.909> overlaps<00:02:37.480> a

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:37.659 
doesn't really matter if it overlaps a

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:39.599 
doesn't really matter if it overlaps a
little<00:02:37.900> bit<00:02:38.079> you<00:02:38.260> can<00:02:38.379> cut<00:02:38.590> that<00:02:38.769> access<00:02:39.310> stuff

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:39.609 
little bit you can cut that access stuff

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:50.080 
little bit you can cut that access stuff
off<00:02:40.319> whenever<00:02:41.319> you're<00:02:41.650> done<00:02:42.599> stapling
