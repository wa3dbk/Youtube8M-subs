new museum and more is to be able and to
find<00:01:17.630> the<00:01:17.780> right<00:01:17.960> solution<00:01:18.200> to<00:01:18.860> do<00:01:19.340> both<00:01:19.790> and

find the right solution to do both and

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.420 
find the right solution to do both and
in<00:01:22.220> the<00:01:22.370> opposite<00:01:22.760> what<00:01:23.120> is<00:01:23.299> less

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
in the opposite what is less

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.120 
in the opposite what is less
spontaneously<00:01:25.430> one<00:01:26.060> can<00:01:26.659> say<00:01:26.900> that<00:01:27.100> less<00:01:28.100> is

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
spontaneously one can say that less is

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.850 
spontaneously one can say that less is
less<00:01:28.580> cost<00:01:28.909> but<00:01:29.570> it's<00:01:29.780> not<00:01:29.840> only<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:30.440> cost

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
less cost but it's not only the cost

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.180 
less cost but it's not only the cost
it's<00:01:31.640> also<00:01:31.909> less<00:01:32.600> standards<00:01:33.500> less

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
it's also less standards less

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
this big amount of regulation so I will

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.060 
this big amount of regulation so I will
try<00:01:49.729> to<00:01:49.790> sue<00:01:50.119> few<00:01:50.540> projects<00:01:51.080> to<00:01:51.229> go<00:01:51.409> Honda<00:01:51.860> in

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
try to sue few projects to go Honda in

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.899 
try to sue few projects to go Honda in

the way we are we are working and just a
short<00:01:56.090> come<00:01:56.659> back<00:01:56.869> to<00:01:57.580> the<00:01:58.580> first<00:01:58.820> project<00:01:59.979> we

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
short come back to the first project we

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.469 
short come back to the first project we
we<00:02:01.490> did<00:02:01.700> now<00:02:02.630> nearly<00:02:03.140> 20<00:02:03.650> years<00:02:03.680> ago<00:02:03.950> that<00:02:04.479> was

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
we did now nearly 20 years ago that was

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.210 
we did now nearly 20 years ago that was
mentioned<00:02:05.750> in<00:02:06.110> the<00:02:06.200> presentation<00:02:06.380> the<00:02:07.009> house

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
mentioned in the presentation the house

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.739 
mentioned in the presentation the house
letter<00:02:07.580> P<00:02:07.880> it<00:02:08.149> was<00:02:08.720> our<00:02:08.899> first<00:02:10.359> project<00:02:11.359> as<00:02:11.719> a

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:11.749 
letter P it was our first project as a

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:16.360 
letter P it was our first project as a
as<00:02:13.090> young<00:02:14.090> architects<00:02:14.749> and<00:02:14.989> at<00:02:15.139> that<00:02:15.590> moment

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
as young architects and at that moment

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.930 
as young architects and at that moment
we<00:02:17.239> had<00:02:17.330> already<00:02:17.599> in<00:02:17.959> mind<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:18.470> idea<00:02:18.680> that<00:02:18.950> the

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
we had already in mind the idea that the

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.729 
we had already in mind the idea that the
concept<00:02:20.390> of<00:02:20.510> housing<00:02:21.049> the<00:02:21.170> concept<00:02:21.620> of

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
concept of housing the concept of

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.970 
concept of housing the concept of
dwelling<00:02:22.340> should<00:02:22.640> should<00:02:23.239> be<00:02:23.450> totally

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
dwelling should should be totally

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.430 
dwelling should should be totally
changed<00:02:24.980> we<00:02:25.129> formulated<00:02:25.670> and<00:02:26.290> for<00:02:27.290> this

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
changed we formulated and for this

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.509 
changed we formulated and for this
project<00:02:27.680> and<00:02:28.099> for<00:02:28.610> family<00:02:29.180> was<00:02:29.480> of<00:02:30.519> workers

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
project and for family was of workers

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.289 
project and for family was of workers
with<00:02:31.760> a<00:02:31.790> very<00:02:32.060> low<00:02:32.269> budget<00:02:33.069> we<00:02:34.069> had<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.519> idea

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
with a very low budget we had the idea

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.440 
with a very low budget we had the idea
to<00:02:35.540> propose<00:02:35.870> something<00:02:36.319> which<00:02:36.739> was<00:02:37.150> much<00:02:38.150> more

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
to propose something which was much more

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.530 
to propose something which was much more
open<00:02:38.690> much<00:02:39.590> more<00:02:39.829> larger<00:02:40.730> with<00:02:41.299> an<00:02:41.510> idea<00:02:42.200> that

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
open much more larger with an idea that

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.680 
open much more larger with an idea that
living<00:02:44.590> space<00:02:45.590> must<00:02:46.069> create<00:02:46.430> a<00:02:46.849> very<00:02:47.420> good

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
living space must create a very good

living space must create a very good

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.289 
conditions of climate inside so as at
moment<00:02:50.959> of<00:02:51.170> his<00:02:51.410> first<00:02:51.709> project<00:02:52.280> that<00:02:52.519> was<00:02:52.760> not

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
moment of his first project that was not

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.259 
moment of his first project that was not
built<00:02:53.569> it<00:02:53.810> not<00:02:54.019> this<00:02:54.260> one<00:02:54.470> which<00:02:54.709> was<00:02:54.890> built

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
built it not this one which was built

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:59.619 
built it not this one which was built
was<00:02:56.269> the<00:02:56.750> idea<00:02:57.200> of<00:02:57.290> building<00:02:58.190> a<00:02:58.730> very<00:02:59.359> large

00:02:59.619 --> 00:02:59.629 
was the idea of building a very large

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:02.770 
was the idea of building a very large
envelope<00:03:00.410> in<00:03:00.680> a<00:03:00.709> very<00:03:01.040> low<00:03:01.250> cost<00:03:01.280> and<00:03:01.909> this

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
envelope in a very low cost and this

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.869 
envelope in a very low cost and this
envelope<00:03:03.409> would<00:03:03.650> was<00:03:04.250> made<00:03:04.519> with

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 
envelope would was made with

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:08.920 
envelope would was made with
prefabricated<00:03:05.690> greenhouse<00:03:06.680> and<00:03:07.120> we<00:03:08.120> we<00:03:08.810> had

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
prefabricated greenhouse and we we had

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.780 
prefabricated greenhouse and we we had
in<00:03:09.109> mind<00:03:09.349> to<00:03:09.530> create<00:03:10.480> under<00:03:11.480> this<00:03:11.629> envelope<00:03:12.170> a

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
in mind to create under this envelope a

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.180 
in mind to create under this envelope a
very<00:03:13.790> nice<00:03:14.030> climate<00:03:14.659> as<00:03:14.870> south<00:03:15.680> of<00:03:15.890> Spain

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
very nice climate as south of Spain

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.479 
very nice climate as south of Spain
because<00:03:17.030> they're<00:03:17.480> this<00:03:17.750> family<00:03:18.319> was<00:03:18.530> very

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
because they're this family was very

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.120 
because they're this family was very
often<00:03:19.819> going<00:03:20.150> to<00:03:20.389> south<00:03:20.660> of<00:03:20.840> Spain<00:03:21.079> for<00:03:21.349> Spain

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
often going to south of Spain for Spain

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.580 
often going to south of Spain for Spain
for<00:03:22.400> holidays<00:03:22.970> and<00:03:23.269> it<00:03:23.930> was<00:03:24.139> really<00:03:24.470> a

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
for holidays and it was really a

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.530 
for holidays and it was really a
pleasure<00:03:24.859> for<00:03:25.280> them<00:03:25.489> to<00:03:25.639> imagine<00:03:25.760> that<00:03:26.299> they

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
pleasure for them to imagine that they

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.809 
pleasure for them to imagine that they
could<00:03:26.750> have<00:03:26.989> in<00:03:27.139> Bordeaux<00:03:27.859> this<00:03:28.430> kind<00:03:28.639> of

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
could have in Bordeaux this kind of

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:31.479 
could have in Bordeaux this kind of
climate<00:03:29.060> and<00:03:29.480> it's<00:03:30.109> very<00:03:30.560> huge<00:03:30.919> envelope

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
climate and it's very huge envelope

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.440 
climate and it's very huge envelope
which<00:03:32.239> was<00:03:32.859> twice<00:03:33.859> bigger<00:03:34.250> than<00:03:34.669> the<00:03:35.180> 80

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
which was twice bigger than the 80

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.479 
which was twice bigger than the 80
square<00:03:35.930> metres<00:03:36.379> that<00:03:36.620> they<00:03:36.859> could<00:03:37.040> normally

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
square metres that they could normally

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:43.240 
square metres that they could normally
afford<00:03:37.940> we<00:03:38.810> could<00:03:39.019> put<00:03:39.760> boxes<00:03:41.769> wooden<00:03:42.769> boxes

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
afford we could put boxes wooden boxes

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.009 
afford we could put boxes wooden boxes
for<00:03:43.639> the<00:03:43.879> traditional<00:03:44.750> rules<00:03:45.129> as<00:03:46.660> bedrooms<00:03:47.660> at

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
for the traditional rules as bedrooms at

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.220 
for the traditional rules as bedrooms at
the<00:03:48.199> living<00:03:48.560> room<00:03:48.769> which<00:03:49.310> has<00:03:49.579> the<00:03:50.230> normal

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
the living room which has the normal

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.900 
the living room which has the normal
conditions<00:03:51.889> of<00:03:52.209> eating<00:03:53.209> of<00:03:53.449> temperature<00:03:54.139> and

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
conditions of eating of temperature and

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:00.479 
conditions of eating of temperature and
this<00:03:55.910> idea<00:03:56.389> of<00:03:57.220> double<00:03:58.220> space<00:03:58.519> was<00:03:59.419> intuitive

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
this idea of double space was intuitive

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.449 
this idea of double space was intuitive
intuitively<00:04:01.750> already<00:04:02.750> there<00:04:03.560> in<00:04:03.859> in<00:04:04.310> this

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
intuitively already there in in this

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.849 
intuitively already there in in this
project<00:04:04.970> so<00:04:05.419> we<00:04:05.569> couldn't<00:04:05.780> do<00:04:06.049> this<00:04:06.260> this<00:04:06.560> one

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:06.859 
project so we couldn't do this this one

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:09.640 
project so we couldn't do this this one
because<00:04:07.129> it<00:04:07.329> was<00:04:08.329> more<00:04:08.810> expensive<00:04:09.410> than<00:04:09.590> the

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
because it was more expensive than the

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.270 
because it was more expensive than the
budget<00:04:10.430> at<00:04:10.639> that<00:04:10.760> moment<00:04:11.269> it<00:04:11.599> was<00:04:11.769> about<00:04:12.769> sixty

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
budget at that moment it was about sixty

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.449 
budget at that moment it was about sixty
thousand<00:04:13.910> euros<00:04:14.389> and<00:04:14.720> we<00:04:15.230> had<00:04:15.410> to<00:04:15.650> to<00:04:16.430> change

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
thousand euros and we had to to change

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.689 
thousand euros and we had to to change
the<00:04:17.000> project<00:04:17.419> but<00:04:17.570> we<00:04:18.139> kept<00:04:18.739> in<00:04:18.889> mind<00:04:18.919> this

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:19.699 
the project but we kept in mind this

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:24.040 
the project but we kept in mind this
question<00:04:20.180> of<00:04:20.359> double<00:04:21.260> envelope<00:04:22.090> as<00:04:23.090> as<00:04:23.570> you<00:04:23.599> as

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
question of double envelope as as you as

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.000 
question of double envelope as as you as
you<00:04:24.110> see<00:04:24.469> here

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.400 

sorry<00:04:29.530> this<00:04:30.530> is<00:04:30.800> just<00:04:31.370> the<00:04:31.580> part<00:04:31.880> which<00:04:32.240> was

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
sorry this is just the part which was

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.310 
sorry this is just the part which was
normally<00:04:33.410> a<00:04:33.710> traditional<00:04:34.370> house<00:04:35.270> and<00:04:35.690> the

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
normally a traditional house and the

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.710 
normally a traditional house and the
envelope<00:04:36.830> allows<00:04:37.280> to<00:04:37.610> make<00:04:37.790> a<00:04:37.820> double<00:04:38.180> volume

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
envelope allows to make a double volume

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.160 
envelope allows to make a double volume
with<00:04:39.320> his<00:04:39.530> very<00:04:39.770> large<00:04:40.100> greenhouse<00:04:41.170> oriented

on orientated on east that brings not

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.090 
on orientated on east that brings not
only<00:04:46.310> a<00:04:46.640> very<00:04:46.880> good<00:04:47.120> climate<00:04:47.780> and<00:04:48.050> very<00:04:48.830> good

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
only a very good climate and very good

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.420 
only a very good climate and very good
value<00:04:49.810> climatic<00:04:50.810> conditions<00:04:51.380> but<00:04:51.890> it's<00:04:52.100> also

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
value climatic conditions but it's also

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.650 
value climatic conditions but it's also
an<00:04:53.320> additional<00:04:54.320> space<00:04:54.650> to<00:04:55.310> extend<00:04:55.880> the<00:04:56.450> life

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
an additional space to extend the life

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.910 
an additional space to extend the life
of<00:04:56.690> the<00:04:57.530> family<00:04:57.980> so<00:04:58.490> for<00:04:58.730> us<00:04:59.050> even<00:05:00.050> if<00:05:00.200> at<00:05:00.740> that

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:00.920 
of the family so for us even if at that

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.130 
of the family so for us even if at that
time<00:05:00.980> we<00:05:01.370> were<00:05:01.490> not<00:05:01.700> able<00:05:01.880> to<00:05:02.150> explain<00:05:02.690> all

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
time we were not able to explain all

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.840 
time we were not able to explain all
this<00:05:03.800> reason<00:05:04.280> but<00:05:04.490> we<00:05:04.940> have<00:05:05.150> the<00:05:05.270> feeling<00:05:05.690> that

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
this reason but we have the feeling that

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.240 
this reason but we have the feeling that
every<00:05:07.850> technique<00:05:08.390> called<00:05:08.840> question<00:05:09.470> must<00:05:10.100> be

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
every technique called question must be

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.140 
every technique called question must be
sold<00:05:10.670> by<00:05:10.970> the<00:05:11.030> space<00:05:11.450> by<00:05:11.870> an<00:05:12.110> addition<00:05:12.710> of

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
sold by the space by an addition of

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.690 
sold by the space by an addition of
living<00:05:14.150> condition<00:05:14.720> of<00:05:14.930> pleasure<00:05:15.350> of<00:05:15.700> all

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700 
living condition of pleasure of all

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.480 
living condition of pleasure of all
right<00:05:16.970> atmosphere<00:05:17.690> and<00:05:18.010> technology<00:05:19.010> is<00:05:19.220> not

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
right atmosphere and technology is not

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.580 
right atmosphere and technology is not
just<00:05:20.620> interesting<00:05:21.620> for<00:05:21.860> for<00:05:22.160> itself<00:05:22.460> so<00:05:23.590> this

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
just interesting for for itself so this

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.640 
just interesting for for itself so this
house<00:05:24.830> was<00:05:25.130> was<00:05:25.610> built<00:05:25.910> with<00:05:26.210> here<00:05:27.170> the<00:05:27.410> plan

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
house was was built with here the plan

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.940 
house was was built with here the plan
and<00:05:27.920> this<00:05:28.120> idea<00:05:29.120> of<00:05:29.450> double<00:05:29.810> space<00:05:30.140> double

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 
and this idea of double space double

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.480 
and this idea of double space double
space<00:05:31.220> that<00:05:31.520> we<00:05:31.760> are<00:05:31.910> still<00:05:32.540> working<00:05:33.440> in<00:05:34.130> this

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
that the programs are all the time very

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.070 
that the programs are all the time very
compressed<00:05:43.310> compressed<00:05:44.060> because<00:05:44.810> they<00:05:44.990> are

compressed compressed because they are

you<00:05:53.660> give<00:05:54.470> an<00:05:54.650> additional<00:05:54.890> space<00:05:55.520> without<00:05:56.330> any

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
you give an additional space without any

and<00:06:00.170> the<00:06:00.740> free<00:06:01.010> space<00:06:01.990> gives<00:06:02.990> something<00:06:03.500> very

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
and the free space gives something very

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.930 
and the free space gives something very
interesting<00:06:04.040> in<00:06:04.550> terms<00:06:04.580> of<00:06:05.030> appropriation<00:06:06.940> so

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.940 
interesting in terms of appropriation so

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.180 
interesting in terms of appropriation so
we<00:06:08.090> built<00:06:08.240> the<00:06:08.480> house<00:06:08.690> and<00:06:09.020> it's<00:06:09.530> still<00:06:09.800> a<00:06:09.860> very

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
we built the house and it's still a very

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.220 
we built the house and it's still a very
very<00:06:10.700> nice<00:06:11.060> house<00:06:11.600> and<00:06:11.900> a<00:06:12.500> long<00:06:13.040> time<00:06:13.280> later

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:14.230 
very nice house and a long time later

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:16.690 
very nice house and a long time later
sinking<00:06:15.230> to<00:06:15.350> this<00:06:15.530> house<00:06:15.740> we<00:06:16.040> came<00:06:16.310> to<00:06:16.550> this

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:16.700 
sinking to this house we came to this

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.200 
sinking to this house we came to this
idea<00:06:16.940> of<00:06:17.330> luxury<00:06:18.200> which<00:06:19.040> is<00:06:19.220> not<00:06:19.430> connected<00:06:20.180> to

the question of cost but connected to

very pleasant conditions a long time

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.770 
very pleasant conditions a long time

that moment seventy-five thousand euros
for<00:07:16.020> one<00:07:16.560> flat<00:07:16.860> and<00:07:18.830> because<00:07:19.830> we<00:07:20.300> in<00:07:21.300> between

for one flat and because we in between
we<00:07:21.990> could<00:07:22.860> see<00:07:23.040> that<00:07:23.250> the<00:07:23.430> first<00:07:23.700> in<00:07:23.940> the<00:07:24.090> first

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:24.330 
we could see that the first in the first

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.170 
we could see that the first in the first
house<00:07:24.630> a<00:07:24.960> house<00:07:25.440> latta<00:07:25.740> p<00:07:26.040> everything<00:07:26.970> was

so<00:07:35.430> we<00:07:36.150> we<00:07:36.480> wanted<00:07:36.870> to<00:07:36.900> go<00:07:37.250> to<00:07:38.250> push<00:07:38.520> as<00:07:38.880> far<00:07:39.540> as

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:39.720 
so we we wanted to go to push as far as
