and at the same time you know as we were

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.840

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
in Japan we went to some of our partners

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.880 
in Japan we went to some of our partners
and<00:01:59.750> asked<00:02:00.050> them<00:02:00.200> if<00:02:00.350> they<00:02:00.530> would<00:02:00.680> be<00:02:00.740> willing

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
and asked them if they would be willing

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.490 
and asked them if they would be willing
to<00:02:01.400> share<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:02.150> stage<00:02:02.330> with<00:02:02.390> us<00:02:02.750> talk<00:02:03.470> about

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
to share the stage with us talk about

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.390 
to share the stage with us talk about
their<00:02:04.090> view<00:02:05.090> on<00:02:05.120> NGP<00:02:05.750> and<00:02:05.990> perhaps<00:02:06.620> also<00:02:07.010> talk

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
their view on NGP and perhaps also talk

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.710 
their view on NGP and perhaps also talk
about<00:02:07.430> some<00:02:07.820> of<00:02:07.850> the<00:02:07.970> exciting<00:02:08.179> and<00:02:08.450> issues

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
about some of the exciting and issues

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.210 
about some of the exciting and issues
that<00:02:08.960> they<00:02:09.110> would<00:02:09.260> like<00:02:09.380> to<00:02:09.500> bring<00:02:09.649> onto<00:02:09.950> n<00:02:10.040> GP

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
that they would like to bring onto n GP

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.010 
that they would like to bring onto n GP
and<00:02:10.550> I<00:02:10.850> think<00:02:11.090> we<00:02:11.210> got<00:02:11.240> a<00:02:11.480> lot<00:02:11.690> of<00:02:11.720> good

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
and I think we got a lot of good

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.950 
and I think we got a lot of good
feedback<00:02:12.200> and<00:02:12.740> a<00:02:13.100> lot<00:02:13.610> of<00:02:13.700> exciting<00:02:14.060> titles

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
feedback and a lot of exciting titles

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.480 
feedback and a lot of exciting titles
like<00:02:15.320> for<00:02:15.530> example<00:02:15.620> especially<00:02:16.340> in<00:02:16.430> the

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
like for example especially in the

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.220 
like for example especially in the
states<00:02:16.760> you<00:02:17.000> know<00:02:17.030> Activision<00:02:17.780> talked<00:02:18.020> about

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
states you know Activision talked about

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.410 
states you know Activision talked about
call<00:02:18.440> of<00:02:18.470> duty<00:02:18.860> that's<00:02:19.520> a<00:02:19.640> very<00:02:19.670> big<00:02:20.060> thing<00:02:20.390> for

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
call of duty that's a very big thing for

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.750 
call of duty that's a very big thing for
for<00:02:21.410> NGP<00:02:21.830> you<00:02:22.160> know<00:02:22.250> having<00:02:22.520> the<00:02:22.610> dual

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
for NGP you know having the dual

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.490 
for NGP you know having the dual
thumbsticks<00:02:23.360> probably<00:02:24.050> played<00:02:24.260> a<00:02:24.290> strong

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
thumbsticks probably played a strong

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.350 
thumbsticks probably played a strong
role<00:02:24.620> in<00:02:24.980> what<00:02:25.700> is<00:02:25.790> going<00:02:26.000> to<00:02:26.090> be<00:02:26.150> bringing

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
role in what is going to be bringing

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:33.290 
role in what is going to be bringing
call<00:02:27.020> of<00:02:27.170> duty<00:02:27.380> to<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.650> MGP

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.290 

I<00:02:33.360> think<00:02:34.260> that<00:02:34.350> you<00:02:35.250> know<00:02:35.340> whether<00:02:35.610> it's<00:02:35.970> a

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
I think that you know whether it's a

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.830 
I think that you know whether it's a

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
home-based console like the ps2 or ps3

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.590 
home-based console like the ps2 or ps3
or<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:39.870> portable<00:02:40.830> console<00:02:41.550> like<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:42.000> NGP<00:02:42.420> that

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
or a portable console like the NGP that

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.600 
or a portable console like the NGP that
we<00:02:42.750> announced<00:02:42.990> today<00:02:43.230> it's<00:02:43.920> very<00:02:44.130> important

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
we announced today it's very important

we announced today it's very important
that<00:02:44.640> we<00:02:44.760> have<00:02:45.030> a<00:02:45.090> very<00:02:45.300> stable<00:02:45.660> platform<00:02:46.020> that

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
that we have a very stable platform that

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.340 
that we have a very stable platform that
is<00:02:47.100> in<00:02:47.400> for<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:47.970> long<00:02:48.150> haul<00:02:48.210> and<00:02:48.690> that<00:02:49.110> means

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
is in for the long haul and that means

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.680 
is in for the long haul and that means
that<00:02:49.590> we're<00:02:49.890> providing<00:02:50.070> a<00:02:50.580> very<00:02:51.210> compelling

Nintendo's dominance in that arena what

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:20.199 
Nintendo's dominance in that arena what
is<00:04:17.600> NGP<00:04:18.350> how<00:04:18.560> is<00:04:18.680> the<00:04:18.739> position<00:04:19.130> to<00:04:19.790> go<00:04:19.910> further

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
is a real strong combination to really

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.820 
is a real strong combination to really
once<00:04:58.639> again<00:04:58.789> not<00:04:59.660> only<00:04:59.840> match<00:05:00.199> the<00:05:00.500> install

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
base that we have for PSP but certainly

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:10.760
