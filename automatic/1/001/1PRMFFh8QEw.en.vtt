a dot CA and today we're going to do the
snow<00:00:16.350> test<00:00:16.710> for<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.460> lifeproof<00:00:17.880> nuud<00:00:18.000> case

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
snow test for the lifeproof nuud case

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.570 
snow test for the lifeproof nuud case
for<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.869> ipad<00:00:19.260> mini<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.859> ipad<00:00:20.310> mini

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
for the ipad mini and the ipad mini

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.769 
for the ipad mini and the ipad mini
retina<00:00:20.779> so<00:00:21.779> this<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.890> case<00:00:23.730> there's<00:00:24.660> an

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
retina so this is the case there's an

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.050 
retina so this is the case there's an
ipad<00:00:25.109> mini<00:00:25.320> it's<00:00:26.010> on<00:00:26.250> there's<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.550> video<00:00:26.789> camera

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
ipad mini it's on there's a video camera

parallel<00:00:29.789> parking<00:00:30.179> only<00:00:30.390> sign<00:00:30.660> so<00:00:31.260> this<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.439> a

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
parallel parking only sign so this is a

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.860

Eskimo she is much colder than I am
she's<00:00:41.850> waving<00:00:42.090> so<00:00:42.930> we've<00:00:43.590> got<00:00:43.770> snow<00:00:44.129> so<00:00:44.730> we're

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
she's waving so we've got snow so we're

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.889 
she's waving so we've got snow so we're
going<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.120> put<00:00:45.360> this<00:00:45.629> into<00:00:46.020> snow<00:00:50.570> so<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:51.719> is

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
going to put this into snow so that is

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.189 
going to put this into snow so that is
an<00:00:52.020> ipad<00:00:52.440> mini<00:00:52.469> nude<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.480> snow<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.809> lifeproof

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
an ipad mini nude and snow the lifeproof

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.900 
an ipad mini nude and snow the lifeproof
nuud<00:00:55.289> case<00:00:55.620> for<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.129> ipad<00:00:56.430> mini<00:00:56.489> is

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
nuud case for the ipad mini is

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.479 
nuud case for the ipad mini is
waterproof<00:00:57.390> up<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.780> 6.6<00:00:58.379> feet<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.949> it's<00:00:59.309> also

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
waterproof up to 6.6 feet and it's also

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.450 
waterproof up to 6.6 feet and it's also
snow<00:00:59.820> proof<00:01:00.059> now<00:01:00.239> snow<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.410> frozen<00:01:01.649> form<00:01:02.219> of

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
snow proof now snow is a frozen form of

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.719 
snow proof now snow is a frozen form of
rain<00:01:03.170> really<00:01:04.170> so<00:01:04.589> if<00:01:05.100> it's<00:01:05.519> waterproof

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
rain really so if it's waterproof

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.609 
rain really so if it's waterproof
there's<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.270> good<00:01:06.390> chance<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.780> snow<00:01:07.020> proof<00:01:07.350> and

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
there's a good chance of snow proof and

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.429 
there's a good chance of snow proof and
i<00:01:07.770> am<00:01:08.400> sure<00:01:08.930> that<00:01:10.070> there<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.250> no<00:01:11.400> problem<00:01:12.439> other

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
i am sure that there is no problem other

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.899 
i am sure that there is no problem other
than<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.770> fact<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.280> camera<00:01:14.760> gets

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
than the fact that the camera gets

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.030 
than the fact that the camera gets
covered<00:01:15.570> with<00:01:15.720> snow<00:01:15.900> all<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.350> time<00:01:16.590> got<00:01:16.920> to

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
covered with snow all the time got to

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.080 
covered with snow all the time got to
find<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.280> better<00:01:17.430> way<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:19.310> dealing<00:01:20.310> with<00:01:20.580> that

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
find a better way of dealing with that

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.300 
find a better way of dealing with that
so<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.600> can<00:01:21.869> kind<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.170> see<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.380> gat<00:01:22.650> as<00:01:22.830> foot<00:01:23.189> at

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
so you can kind of see a gat as foot at

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.030 
so you can kind of see a gat as foot at
the<00:01:23.340> bottom<00:01:23.790> of<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.750> video<00:01:25.189> so<00:01:26.189> snow<00:01:26.970> test

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
the bottom of the the video so snow test

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.490 
the bottom of the the video so snow test
pass<00:01:29.040> number<00:01:29.490> one<00:01:29.960> the<00:01:30.960> next<00:01:31.200> thing<00:01:31.320> I'm<00:01:31.470> going

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
pass number one the next thing I'm going

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.800 
pass number one the next thing I'm going
to<00:01:31.650> do<00:01:31.860> I'm<00:01:32.159> going<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.460> go<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.909> shovel<00:01:33.509> this

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
to do I'm going to go and shovel this

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.859 
to do I'm going to go and shovel this
little<00:01:34.710> Bank<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.759> snow<00:01:36.259> with<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:38.570> nude<00:01:39.570> case

little Bank of snow with the nude case

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.330 
little Bank of snow with the nude case
for<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.170> ipad<00:01:40.500> mini

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.130 

looks<00:01:47.340> like<00:01:47.490> it's<00:01:47.640> protecting<00:01:48.150> them<00:01:48.330> you<00:01:49.020> know

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
looks like it's protecting them you know

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.990 
looks like it's protecting them you know
it's<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.800> again<00:01:50.040> it's<00:01:50.220> snow<00:01:50.490> so<00:01:50.730> it's<00:01:50.850> not

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
it's and again it's snow so it's not

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
going to seep right into your case right

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.520 
going to seep right into your case right
away<00:01:53.910> maybe<00:01:54.840> if<00:01:55.020> we<00:01:55.640> boil<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.880> in<00:01:56.910> some<00:01:57.090> water

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
away maybe if we boil it in some water

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.990 
away maybe if we boil it in some water
promise<00:01:58.530> notice<00:01:58.950> is<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.190> cameras<00:01:59.580> always<00:01:59.760> get

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
promise notice is the cameras always get

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.810 
promise notice is the cameras always get
covered<00:02:00.330> with<00:02:00.450> snow<00:02:00.800> there<00:02:01.800> we<00:02:01.920> go<00:02:02.070> what

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
covered with snow there we go what

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.620 
covered with snow there we go what
happens<00:02:03.300> if<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:03.720> do<00:02:03.780> this<00:02:08.270> so<00:02:09.270> if<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:09.450> found

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
happens if I do this so if you found

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.780 
happens if I do this so if you found
this<00:02:09.780> review<00:02:09.990> and<00:02:10.290> any<00:02:11.130> way<00:02:11.340> shape<00:02:11.580> or<00:02:11.730> form

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
useful because you know it's really just

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.570 
useful because you know it's really just
know<00:02:15.350> you<00:02:16.350> know<00:02:16.470> when<00:02:16.800> it's<00:02:16.950> so<00:02:17.070> cold<00:02:17.370> it's

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.270 
know you know when it's so cold it's
kind<00:02:18.240> of<00:02:18.300> dry<00:02:18.810> I<00:02:19.140> don't<00:02:19.980> know<00:02:20.070> if<00:02:20.130> that<00:02:20.250> makes

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
kind of dry I don't know if that makes

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.740
