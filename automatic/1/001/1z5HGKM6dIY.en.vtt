00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:16.369
 develop the culé team 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.749
 and in the face of the success of relating 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:21.320
 four years 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.419
 in a convention 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:25.480
 play havana specifically 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.999
 started in computer science where he gets every hobby is armed 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:31.529
 desire is free 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.840
 i d'addario rivera 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.020
 in that moment to reveal some 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.300
 technical computer of the power to be 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.700
 in the report 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.469
 and it leads to your operating system 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:47.550
 on this computer 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.550
 it occurred to me that this great idea of 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.900
 in the whole world that does not 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.960
 have access to information technology 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.090
 older children in 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.659
 people with disabilities 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:02.240
 could have 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.210
 a very easy-to-use coordinator 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.740
 it's a leisure-oriented product 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.740
 the dictation of April 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.080
 if we see the screen and visit him 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.160
 the tc 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.160
 of building operating system lenovo 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.750
 you can see in the categories are cossío 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.690
 education 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.030
 ilie wrong digital 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.030
 after leading the part that is communication where is 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.840
 the dgac videoconferencing applications to roll 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.690
 r 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.429
 email 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:40.560
 Internet connection that finds out 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.360
 more usable and more accessible but fundamentally it is thought 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.470
 not only for the region but 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.470
 people in situations of dependency are for children 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.369
 for the elderly 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.200
 for disabled people 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.350
 i ltd must also have 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.780
 everything you have to enter 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.840
 or all applications for example book reader 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.689
 electronic, as I said before, it also has health applications 

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:11.579
 of digital drug 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:15.680
 Of course all the applications of the Huca Tibás 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:19.139
 anyway, it was tremendous 

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:22.299
 until now the reform a speech and contents 

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:24.819
 the critic 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.479
 course d 

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:27.849
 and of course 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.260
 How not 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.660
 all that this publication supposes is for disabled people 

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:34.919
 we have 

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:38.399
 to pressures like gallows for blind people 

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:40.780
 inguralde that we have integrated 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.560
 it even says something like 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.519
 the interface based on colors 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.529
 and based on that there should not be more than 6 

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:48.679
 the event 

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:53.009
 click on read engines menu on the screen 

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:56.099
 and these elements also 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.209
 he has each one a color 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:59.759
 so that we can 

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:01.319
 to interact 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.759
 per bob and being the corresponding color 

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:07.759
 so the consumer can be more useful 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.599
 as the forward has said 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:13.559
 c 

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:16.250
 digital devices has been thought 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.220
 for people in unemployment situation 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.089
 I think 

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:22.819
 who else 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:24.229
 upi / ser 

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:28.370
 electric being for people not connected for people 

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:31.259
 not until now 

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:34.439
 both injured though this technology the computer 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:38.110
 and in Spain it is 45% 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.879
 but if we go to countries 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:43.699
 from the dental medical area 

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:46.400
 They can reach up to 90% 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.150
 what has been lived in concrete format tablet pc 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.959
 for this product 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.029
 well our idea dyn tehran 

00:03:54.029 --> 00:03:57.119
 a governor that the 2000 when we live 

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:59.929
 the slg in the report 

00:03:59.929 --> 00:04:03.619
 varela ordered has also declared and that it would appear to the side 

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:07.409
 that to compensate as natural as possible 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:10.579
 that is to say and that resembles what normally 

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:15.249
 the kids who go to school where he studied a wang notebook more 

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:16.180
 actively 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.669
 a blackboard not 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.150
 then the father was weird 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.980
 min from the beginning 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.419
 Our idea is not 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:27.520
 prd may or may not coincide with the fashion of what the 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.659
 touch screen on both mobiles as now 

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:34.910
 in paleontologists 9s percent 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.960
 announced that they are already fashionable 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.210
 the project has been made the state fell 12 j 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.439
 of AIDS research because past phase has worked in favor 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.849
 well represented it is true that it started more than 20 years ago 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:54.659
 when we develop 

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:56.939
 we try like 

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:59.289
 financed by excess 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:01.490
 percent keyboard concepts 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.639
 but if this has been the origin in reality 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:07.889
 d you must visit lee and the system 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:09.699
 nap 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:12.099
 What is it 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:16.580
 the acronym of the integrated service and support technology system 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:21.779
 actually in the text a surface will not be tolerated 

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:27.029
 tactile exactly like the screens that this fashion novelist 

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:31.070
 about what the fence or to play life 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.860
 where can we draw 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.240
 a series of icon 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.379
 what the easiest base 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:40.849
 p the one to interact with 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:44.529
 the system lost in the time it comes doing was 

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:46.550
 very complicated especially for 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.129
 people in a situation of dependency 

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:51.030
 l that same interfax 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.030
 based on the keyboard the concept we have passed now 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.969
 eliminating any peripheral 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:01.419
 of course that basketball but also eliminates any kind of deal 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:02.650
 monteclaro 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:03.800
 is to wait 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.260
 read so that the echo the screen the multis with 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.570
 movements of these forests enter 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:11.919
 we can perform 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:15.449
 any interaction with the fingers but the foundation 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.439
 digital delphi and our system if this 

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:22.129
 this applications 

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:25.050
 i the data show in which they were developed 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.730
 more than 20 years ago 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:29.730
 for the concept shed is the same idea 

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:33.339
 to a touch screen 

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:36.080
 now
