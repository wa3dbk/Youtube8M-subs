00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
like but what I like to do here is just

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.500 
like but what I like to do here is just
add<00:02:08.990> it<00:02:09.140> all<00:02:09.320> into<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:10.460> pan<00:02:10.729> with<00:02:10.759> the<00:02:11.120> turkey

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
and from this step you can portion this

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.340 
and from this step you can portion this
up<00:02:13.790> into<00:02:14.030> however<00:02:14.480> many<00:02:14.720> servings<00:02:15.110> you<00:02:15.230> would

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
you can do the totals and then just

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.610 
you can do the totals and then just
divide<00:02:20.210> it<00:02:20.240> by<00:02:20.510> how<00:02:20.540> many<00:02:20.810> servings<00:02:21.320> that<00:02:21.440> you

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620
