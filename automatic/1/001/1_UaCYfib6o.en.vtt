what<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.489> will<00:00:38.640> seep<00:00:38.940> into<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.239> ball<00:00:39.570> into<00:00:39.750> the

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
what it will seep into the ball into the

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.930 
what it will seep into the ball into the
foam<00:00:40.170> board<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:40.980> what<00:00:41.219> do<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.399> do<00:00:41.579> when<00:00:41.820> these

kind of things happen to support you get

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.010 
kind of things happen to support you get
two<00:00:44.100> options<00:00:44.340> one<00:00:45.120> would<00:00:45.300> be<00:00:45.420> single<00:00:45.780> thing

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
two options one would be single thing

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.260 
two options one would be single thing
doctor<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.680> second<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.760> can<00:00:47.910> just<00:00:48.090> do<00:00:48.210> it

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
doctor and second you can just do it

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.790 
doctor and second you can just do it
yourself

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.930 

the<00:00:52.800> first<00:00:53.039> step<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.460> repairing<00:00:53.850> your

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
the first step to repairing your

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.450 
the first step to repairing your
surfboard<00:00:54.510> will<00:00:55.110> be<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.649> make<00:00:55.890> sure<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.309> your

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
surfboard will be to make sure that your

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.939 
surfboard will be to make sure that your
server<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:56.969> completely<00:00:57.539> dry<00:00:57.870> leave<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.680> out<00:00:58.800> in

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
server is completely dry leave it out in

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.299 
server is completely dry leave it out in
the<00:00:59.039> Sun<00:00:59.309> for<00:00:59.960> hours<00:01:00.960> or<00:01:01.260> days<00:01:01.289> depending<00:01:02.190> on

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
the Sun for hours or days depending on

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.000 
the Sun for hours or days depending on
how<00:01:02.489> wet<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.850> foam<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.470> remove<00:01:04.470> these<00:01:04.769> pieces

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
how wet the foam is remove these pieces

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.120 
how wet the foam is remove these pieces
of<00:01:05.309> foam<00:01:05.580> dirt<00:01:06.210> see<00:01:06.600> with<00:01:06.750> our<00:01:06.990> hair<00:01:07.650> anything

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
of foam dirt see with our hair anything

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.179 
of foam dirt see with our hair anything
stuck<00:01:08.520> in<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.790> ding<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.619> the<00:01:10.619> next<00:01:10.920> thing<00:01:11.070> will

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
stuck in a ding and the next thing will

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.679 
stuck in a ding and the next thing will
be<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.369> remove<00:01:11.820> all<00:01:11.970> these<00:01:12.119> loose<00:01:12.390> fiber

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
be to remove all these loose fiber

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.440 
be to remove all these loose fiber
cloths<00:01:13.049> try<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.799> use<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.040> glove<00:01:14.369> as<00:01:14.700> a

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
cloths try to use a glove as a

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.999 
cloths try to use a glove as a
girls<00:01:15.720> will<00:01:15.840> get<00:01:15.960> stuck<00:01:16.200> in<00:01:16.259> your<00:01:16.409> skin<00:01:16.799> and

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
girls will get stuck in your skin and

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.240 
girls will get stuck in your skin and
they<00:01:17.580> will<00:01:17.729> retail<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.210> for<00:01:18.420> days<00:01:18.890> the<00:01:19.890> second

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
they will retail you for days the second

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.190 
they will retail you for days the second
step<00:01:20.430> would<00:01:20.640> be<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.820> send<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.450> damaged<00:01:21.840> area

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
step would be to send the damaged area

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.499 
step would be to send the damaged area
send<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.890> damaged<00:01:23.310> area<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.180> reason

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
send a damaged area so that the reason

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.190 
send a damaged area so that the reason
sticks<00:01:24.810> well<00:01:26.450> what<00:01:27.450> do<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.570> want<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.810> do<00:01:27.960> now

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
sticks well what do you want to do now

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.620 
sticks well what do you want to do now
is<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.950> create<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.280> boundary<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:30.270> can<00:01:30.299> use

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
is to create a boundary you can use

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.319 
is to create a boundary you can use
masking<00:01:31.049> tape<00:01:31.110> or<00:01:31.439> any<00:01:31.590> tape<00:01:32.180> boundary<00:01:33.180> around

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
masking tape or any tape boundary around

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.940 
masking tape or any tape boundary around
the<00:01:33.900> tail<00:01:34.340> let's<00:01:35.340> recreate<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.790> cavity<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:36.720> that

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
the tail let's recreate a cavity so that

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.170 
the tail let's recreate a cavity so that
you<00:01:37.950> can<00:01:38.130> put<00:01:38.310> in<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.400> reason<00:01:38.820> after<00:01:41.000> the<00:01:42.000> next

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
you can put in a reason after the next

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.120 
you can put in a reason after the next
step<00:01:42.450> in<00:01:42.780> this<00:01:42.990> process<00:01:43.259> will<00:01:43.590> be<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.710> apply

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
step in this process will be to apply

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.300 
step in this process will be to apply
the<00:01:44.700> reason<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.630> UV<00:01:45.930> curing<00:01:46.290> reason<00:01:46.619> remember

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
the reason the UV curing reason remember

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.609 
the reason the UV curing reason remember
to<00:01:47.460> do<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.759> indoors<00:01:48.149> because<00:01:48.439> this<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.590> a

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
to do it indoors because this is a

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.830 
to do it indoors because this is a
reason<00:01:50.040> it's<00:01:50.280> very<00:01:50.490> sensitive<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:51.210> light<00:01:51.240> oil

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
reason it's very sensitive to light oil

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.109 
reason it's very sensitive to light oil
I<00:01:51.930> mean<00:01:52.170> sunlight<00:01:52.890> or<00:01:53.159> just<00:01:53.369> UV<00:01:53.670> rays<00:01:56.119> getting

I mean sunlight or just UV rays getting

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.860 
I mean sunlight or just UV rays getting
into<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.450> spot<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:57.869> want
