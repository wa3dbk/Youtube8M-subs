00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
these and my inspiration from these came

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.500 
these and my inspiration from these came
from<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:20.100> black<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.520> white<00:00:20.640> checks<00:00:21.029> dress

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
from the black and white checks dress

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.109 
from the black and white checks dress
which<00:00:22.470> worked<00:00:22.740> in<00:00:22.949> my<00:00:23.100> offices<00:00:23.580> like<00:00:23.939> the

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
which worked in my offices like the

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.359 
which worked in my offices like the
blacks<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.720> one<00:00:24.840> side<00:00:25.050> white<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.800> other<00:00:25.830> and

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
blacks to one side white the other and

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.519 
blacks to one side white the other and
when<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.240> was<00:00:27.449> researching<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:28.019> bit<00:00:28.170> more<00:00:28.349> about

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
when I was researching a bit more about

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.009 
when I was researching a bit more about
this<00:00:28.679> pattern<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.279> came<00:00:29.609> across<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.570> dress<00:00:30.840> that

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
this pattern I came across a dress that

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.189 
this pattern I came across a dress that
was<00:00:31.140> in<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.410> same<00:00:32.330> design<00:00:33.330> that<00:00:33.360> was<00:00:33.870> using

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:34.199 
was in the same design that was using

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:35.539 
was in the same design that was using
circles<00:00:34.769> so<00:00:34.949> I<00:00:34.979> thought<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.400> I<00:00:35.430> would

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:35.549 
circles so I thought that I would

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:37.310 
circles so I thought that I would
incorporate<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.150> two<00:00:36.330> and<00:00:36.629> put<00:00:36.870> them<00:00:37.019> onto<00:00:37.170> a

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
incorporate the two and put them onto a

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.920 
incorporate the two and put them onto a
nail<00:00:37.559> design<00:00:37.850> see<00:00:38.850> all<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.150> need<00:00:39.330> today<00:00:39.540> for

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
so what we're gonna do is just literally

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.310 
so what we're gonna do is just literally
paint<00:01:22.320> half<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:23.070> nail<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.870> you<00:01:24.870> can<00:01:25.050> do<00:01:25.200> this

paint half the nail and you can do this

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.620 
paint half the nail and you can do this
freehand<00:01:25.590> or<00:01:25.950> if<00:01:26.160> you<00:01:26.310> really<00:01:26.550> wanted<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.270> get

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
freehand or if you really wanted to get

freehand or if you really wanted to get
a<00:01:27.690> really<00:01:28.020> sharp<00:01:28.320> line<00:01:28.650> if<00:01:28.800> you<00:01:28.890> don't<00:01:29.040> think

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
a really sharp line if you don't think

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.890 
a really sharp line if you don't think
you<00:01:29.280> can<00:01:29.400> do<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.520> with<00:01:29.730> the<00:01:29.820> brush<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.780> could

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
you can do it with the brush you could

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.260 
you can do it with the brush you could
always<00:01:31.020> use<00:01:31.260> a<00:01:31.290> bit<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.980> scotch<00:01:32.640> tape<00:01:32.940> and

always use a bit of a scotch tape and

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.030 
always use a bit of a scotch tape and
just<00:01:35.360> peel<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.390> off<00:01:36.510> after<00:01:36.990> you've<00:01:37.110> painted<00:01:37.350> so

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
just peel it off after you've painted so

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.560 
just peel it off after you've painted so
literally<00:01:38.580> all<00:01:38.760> you're<00:01:39.000> gonna<00:01:39.120> do<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.420> just

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
literally go up the nail creating a

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:49.969 
literally go up the nail creating a
fairly<00:01:43.760> straight<00:01:44.760> line<00:01:45.000> there<00:01:46.100> and<00:01:48.830> cover<00:01:49.830> the

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
fairly straight line there and cover the

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.360 
fairly straight line there and cover the
rest<00:01:50.159> of<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.430> side<00:01:51.710> try<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:52.860> keep<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.070> at<00:01:53.190> the

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
rest of that side try and keep it at the

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.090 
rest of that side try and keep it at the
cuticles<00:01:53.790> if<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:54.000> can<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.979> you'll<00:01:55.979> probably

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
cuticles if you can and you'll probably

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.950 
cuticles if you can and you'll probably
want<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.490> do<00:01:56.640> T<00:01:56.850> layers<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.390> depending<00:01:57.870> on

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
want to do T layers of that depending on

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.930 
want to do T layers of that depending on
the<00:01:58.020> block<00:01:58.260> that<00:01:58.440> you<00:01:58.500> use<00:01:58.830> to<00:01:59.070> see<00:01:59.250> how<00:01:59.490> full

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
the block that you use to see how full

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.149 
the block that you use to see how full
the<00:02:00.120> coverage<00:02:00.510> is<00:02:00.720> so<00:02:01.440> then<00:02:01.650> once<00:02:01.950> that's

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
the coverage is so then once that's

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.420 
the coverage is so then once that's
dried<00:02:02.520> we<00:02:02.850> can<00:02:03.060> carry<00:02:03.270> on<00:02:03.420> with<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.750> design

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
dried we can carry on with the design

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.830 
dried we can carry on with the design
okay<00:02:05.430> so<00:02:05.490> now<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:05.880> that's<00:02:06.210> dried<00:02:06.450> I've<00:02:06.690> gone

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
okay so now that that's dried I've gone

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.899 
okay so now that that's dried I've gone
ahead<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.110> got<00:02:07.380> some<00:02:07.620> black<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.519> white<00:02:08.640> nail

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.840 
out pain which and then I'm just gonna
use<00:02:11.930> like<00:02:12.930> a<00:02:12.990> brush<00:02:13.410> like<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.250> little<00:02:14.490> nail<00:02:14.640> art

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
think so I'm going to do the white nail

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.150 
think so I'm going to do the white nail
art<00:02:25.210> paint<00:02:25.450> first<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:26.230> obviously<00:02:26.710> working<00:02:26.890> on

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
art paint first and obviously working on

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.240 
art paint first and obviously working on
the<00:02:27.250> black<00:02:27.430> side<00:02:27.760> and<00:02:28.320> with<00:02:29.320> this<00:02:29.500> it's<00:02:29.920> just<00:02:30.130> a

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
the black side and with this it's just a

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.520 
the black side and with this it's just a
case<00:02:30.430> of<00:02:30.460> create<00:02:31.240> any<00:02:31.480> design<00:02:32.050> that<00:02:32.080> you<00:02:32.380> want

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
case of create any design that you want

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.570 
case of create any design that you want
to<00:02:34.380> with<00:02:35.380> the<00:02:35.530> sixties<00:02:35.890> design<00:02:36.310> that<00:02:36.490> I've

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
to with the sixties design that I've

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.850 
to with the sixties design that I've
taken<00:02:36.790> this<00:02:37.090> from<00:02:37.270> it<00:02:37.630> was<00:02:37.930> like<00:02:38.290> a<00:02:38.320> black<00:02:38.650> and

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
taken this from it was like a black and

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.490 
taken this from it was like a black and
white<00:02:38.980> dress<00:02:39.760> and<00:02:40.150> just<00:02:40.600> basically<00:02:40.930> had<00:02:41.230> white

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
white dress and just basically had white

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.470 
white dress and just basically had white
circles<00:02:41.950> on<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.130> black<00:02:42.310> side<00:02:42.520> and<00:02:43.240> black

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
circles on the black side and black

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.140 
circles on the black side and black
circles<00:02:43.990> on<00:02:44.080> the<00:02:44.170> white<00:02:44.320> side<00:02:44.560> so<00:02:44.920> it<00:02:45.520> is<00:02:45.700> just

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
circles on the white side so it is just

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:52.800 
circles on the white side so it is just
do<00:02:47.050> whatever<00:02:47.260> you<00:02:47.620> fancy<00:02:47.830> really<00:02:48.570> and<00:02:51.780> you<00:02:52.780> can

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
do whatever you fancy really and you can

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.449 
do whatever you fancy really and you can
make<00:02:53.170> all<00:02:53.320> of<00:02:53.380> the<00:02:53.590> nails<00:02:53.800> to<00:02:53.950> stay<00:02:54.160> where<00:02:54.400> you

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
make all of the nails to stay where you

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.010 
make all of the nails to stay where you
can<00:02:54.610> make<00:02:54.730> more<00:02:54.940> different<00:02:55.270> like<00:02:55.360> I<00:02:55.510> have<00:02:55.750> and

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
can make more different like I have and

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.680 
can make more different like I have and
so<00:02:56.260> you<00:02:56.500> can<00:02:57.010> just<00:02:57.220> sort<00:02:57.370> of<00:02:57.459> do<00:02:58.150> whatever<00:02:58.330> you

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
so you can just sort of do whatever you

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:59.330 
so you can just sort of do whatever you
like

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
like

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.720 
like
there's<00:03:00.340> no<00:03:00.610> set<00:03:00.910> rule<00:03:01.120> with<00:03:01.330> this<00:03:01.510> one<00:03:03.930> and

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
there's no set rule with this one and

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.070 
there's no set rule with this one and
you<00:03:06.730> can<00:03:06.880> either<00:03:07.030> then<00:03:07.300> take<00:03:07.570> it<00:03:07.720> so<00:03:07.870> that<00:03:07.990> you

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
you can either then take it so that you

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.170 
you can either then take it so that you
make<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:08.470> same<00:03:08.770> design<00:03:09.220> but<00:03:09.400> on<00:03:09.520> the<00:03:09.700> opposite

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
make the same design but on the opposite

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.270 
make the same design but on the opposite
side<00:03:10.480> or<00:03:10.810> you<00:03:11.260> can<00:03:11.470> just<00:03:11.709> switch<00:03:12.070> it<00:03:12.220> up

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
side or you can just switch it up

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.710 
side or you can just switch it up
completely<00:03:12.550> and<00:03:13.090> I<00:03:13.990> think<00:03:14.260> on<00:03:14.380> this<00:03:14.530> one<00:03:15.720> I'm

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
completely and I think on this one I'm

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.180 
completely and I think on this one I'm
going<00:03:16.990> to<00:03:17.050> switch<00:03:17.260> it<00:03:17.290> up<00:03:17.470> a<00:03:17.620> little<00:03:17.650> bit<00:03:17.980> just

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
going to switch it up a little bit just

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.520 
going to switch it up a little bit just
to<00:03:18.430> make<00:03:18.730> it<00:03:18.760> a<00:03:19.120> bit<00:03:19.810> different<00:03:20.200> from<00:03:20.350> the

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
to make it a bit different from the

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.790 
to make it a bit different from the
other<00:03:20.680> ones<00:03:23.400> and<00:03:25.260> then<00:03:26.260> you<00:03:26.350> can<00:03:26.500> also<00:03:26.650> use

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
other ones and then you can also use

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.130 
other ones and then you can also use
like<00:03:27.220> your<00:03:27.430> dotting<00:03:28.120> tool<00:03:30.690> I'm<00:03:31.690> just<00:03:31.930> going<00:03:32.110> to

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
like your dotting tool I'm just going to

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.509 
like your dotting tool I'm just going to
pop<00:03:32.380> one<00:03:33.190> of<00:03:33.340> those<00:03:33.519> there<00:03:33.880> and<00:03:35.280> then<00:03:36.280> in<00:03:36.430> a

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
pop one of those there and then in a

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.070 
pop one of those there and then in a
minute<00:03:36.640> go<00:03:36.910> back<00:03:37.120> and<00:03:37.330> pop<00:03:37.480> a<00:03:37.510> little<00:03:37.810> black

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
minute go back and pop a little black

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.130 
minute go back and pop a little black
dot<00:03:38.680> in<00:03:38.890> the<00:03:38.980> middle<00:03:39.220> of<00:03:39.310> those<00:03:39.959> so<00:03:40.959> then<00:03:41.080> I'm

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
dot in the middle of those so then I'm

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.990 
dot in the middle of those so then I'm
going<00:03:41.260> to<00:03:41.290> move<00:03:41.440> on<00:03:41.560> to<00:03:41.730> working<00:03:42.730> with<00:03:42.880> the

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
going to move on to working with the

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:52.949 
going to move on to working with the
black<00:03:43.269> paint<00:03:43.600> on<00:03:43.720> the<00:03:43.870> white<00:03:44.019> side

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:04:05.550 

and

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.130 

I<00:04:05.590> literally<00:04:06.490> just<00:04:06.880> put<00:04:07.240> the<00:04:07.360> circles<00:04:07.870> of

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
I literally just put the circles of

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.080 
I literally just put the circles of
wherever<00:04:08.410> you<00:04:08.709> like<00:04:08.920> you<00:04:09.400> could<00:04:09.610> do<00:04:09.760> this<00:04:09.880> with

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
wherever you like you could do this with

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.970 
wherever you like you could do this with
squares<00:04:10.510> or<00:04:10.810> any<00:04:10.990> sort<00:04:11.440> of<00:04:12.030> shapes<00:04:13.030> really<00:04:13.180> but

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
squares or any sort of shapes really but

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600

wanted<00:04:35.840> to<00:04:35.990> you<00:04:36.080> could<00:04:36.230> add<00:04:36.410> some<00:04:36.680> like

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860
