this year you know we're super fast and
I<00:00:44.750> think<00:00:45.020> both<00:00:45.230> of<00:00:45.260> us<00:00:45.440> are<00:00:45.620> fit<00:00:45.860> and<00:00:45.890> then<00:00:46.250> I

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
I think both of us are fit and then I

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.340 
I think both of us are fit and then I
don't<00:00:47.000> think<00:00:47.180> there's<00:00:47.329> a<00:00:47.390> lot<00:00:47.660> you<00:00:47.720> can<00:00:48.020> change

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
don't think there's a lot you can change

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.810 
don't think there's a lot you can change
I<00:00:48.500> mean<00:00:48.649> sometimes<00:00:49.070> you<00:00:49.130> have<00:00:49.250> bad<00:00:49.399> luck<00:00:49.430> I

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
I mean sometimes you have bad luck I

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.069 
I mean sometimes you have bad luck I
mean<00:00:49.970> you<00:00:50.149> for<00:00:50.480> sure<00:00:50.600> have<00:00:50.780> to<00:00:50.899> learn<00:00:51.020> from

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
mean you for sure have to learn from

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.139 
mean you for sure have to learn from
those<00:00:51.320> mistakes<00:00:51.380> but<00:00:52.010> I<00:00:52.040> think<00:00:52.370> the<00:00:52.970> last

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
those mistakes but I think the last

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:54.970 
those mistakes but I think the last
thing<00:00:53.300> you<00:00:53.510> want<00:00:53.690> to<00:00:53.750> do<00:00:53.899> is<00:00:54.079> go<00:00:54.290> home<00:00:54.320> and<00:00:54.559> and

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
thing you want to do is go home and and

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.040 
thing you want to do is go home and and
stress<00:00:55.670> about<00:00:55.880> things<00:00:56.180> that<00:00:56.300> will<00:00:56.600> you<00:00:57.020> know

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
stress about things that will you know

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.020 
stress about things that will you know
it<00:00:57.350> will<00:00:57.470> make<00:00:57.860> things<00:00:57.890> worse<00:00:58.579> than<00:00:58.820> they<00:00:58.880> were

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
it will make things worse than they were

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.530 
it will make things worse than they were
going<00:00:59.480> so<00:00:59.750> i<00:00:59.989> think<00:01:00.920> just<00:01:01.309> i<00:01:01.550> would<00:01:02.000> what<00:01:02.180> i<00:01:02.239> did

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
Vegas and it's still undecided i think

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.440 
Vegas and it's still undecided i think
in<00:02:32.350> both<00:02:32.590> both<00:02:33.130> classes<00:02:33.550> are<00:02:33.700> within<00:02:34.090> five

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
in both both classes are within five

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.900 
in both both classes are within five
points<00:02:34.480> so<00:02:35.050> it's<00:02:35.920> going<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.130> be<00:02:36.250> good<00:02:36.430> racing

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
points so it's going to be good racing

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.199 
points so it's going to be good racing
and<00:02:37.120> and<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:39.100> two<00:02:39.340> guys<00:02:39.550> that<00:02:39.580> or<00:02:40.030> i<00:02:40.060> should

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
and and the two guys that or i should

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:41.699 
and and the two guys that or i should
say<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.660> four<00:02:40.900> that<00:02:41.050> are<00:02:41.110> racing<00:02:41.470> each<00:02:41.560> other

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
say the four that are racing each other

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.180 
say the four that are racing each other
for<00:02:42.040> different<00:02:42.459> coasts<00:02:42.820> are<00:02:42.880> our<00:02:43.769> great<00:02:44.769> racer

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
for different coasts are our great racer

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.160 
for different coasts are our great racer
so<00:02:45.459> it's<00:02:45.880> going<00:02:46.030> to<00:02:46.090> be<00:02:46.209> interesting<00:02:46.420> to<00:02:46.750> see<00:02:46.930> i

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
so it's going to be interesting to see i

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.809 
so it's going to be interesting to see i
think<00:02:47.650> it's<00:02:47.769> going<00:02:47.860> to<00:02:47.920> come<00:02:48.100> down<00:02:48.160> to<00:02:48.310> a<00:02:48.459> start

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
think it's going to come down to a start

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.690 
think it's going to come down to a start
and<00:02:49.830> most<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:51.070> four<00:02:51.310> that<00:02:51.459> are<00:02:51.489> out<00:02:51.670> there

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
and most the four that are out there

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.240 
and most the four that are out there
they<00:02:52.120> get<00:02:52.299> all<00:02:52.690> get<00:02:53.019> good<00:02:53.170> starts<00:02:53.530> so<00:02:53.739> i<00:02:53.950> think

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
they get all get good starts so i think

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.350 
they get all get good starts so i think
we<00:02:54.430> should<00:02:54.549> have<00:02:54.640> some<00:02:54.730> really<00:02:54.880> good<00:02:55.060> race<00:02:55.209> in

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
we should have some really good race in

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.780 
we should have some really good race in
our<00:02:55.510> hands
