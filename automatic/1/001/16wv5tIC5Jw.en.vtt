produces immune system cells so you'll

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:09.529 
produces immune system cells so you'll

back in the 30s
scientists<00:01:21.780> knew<00:01:21.929> about<00:01:22.079> synthetic<00:01:22.829> vitamin

00:01:23.239 --> 00:01:23.249 
scientists knew about synthetic vitamin

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:27.520 
scientists knew about synthetic vitamin
D<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.729> they<00:01:24.539> looked<00:01:24.899> at<00:01:25.049> women<00:01:25.409> as<00:01:25.950> offspring

I<00:01:31.979> think<00:01:32.039> it<00:01:32.369> was<00:01:32.490> 37<00:01:33.090> as<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.539> recall<00:01:33.899> they

within<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.310> body<00:02:54.519> -<00:02:54.940> so<00:02:55.690> we're<00:02:56.079> mankind<00:02:56.829> and

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
within the body - so we're mankind and

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.000 
within the body - so we're mankind and
science<00:02:57.609> got<00:02:57.819> way<00:02:58.060> off<00:02:58.239> track<00:02:58.540> is<00:02:58.959> we'd<00:02:59.709> get<00:02:59.980> a

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
science got way off track is we'd get a

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.580 
science got way off track is we'd get a
little<00:03:00.430> bit<00:03:00.579> of<00:03:00.700> knowledge<00:03:00.849> from<00:03:01.390> nature<00:03:01.900> like

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
little bit of knowledge from nature like

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.410 
little bit of knowledge from nature like
hey<00:03:02.799> the<00:03:03.010> body<00:03:03.220> has<00:03:03.459> steroids<00:03:03.940> in<00:03:04.180> and<00:03:04.329> of

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
hey the body has steroids in and of

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.259 
hey the body has steroids in and of
itself<00:03:05.109> and<00:03:05.440> they<00:03:06.040> produce<00:03:06.280> in<00:03:06.670> the<00:03:06.879> what<00:03:07.060> the

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
itself and they produce in the what the

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:08.940 
itself and they produce in the what the
endocrine<00:03:07.720> system<00:03:08.109> the<00:03:08.140> glandular<00:03:08.470> system

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
endocrine system the glandular system

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.309 
endocrine system the glandular system
and<00:03:09.370> that's<00:03:10.150> why<00:03:10.359> it<00:03:10.420> attacks<00:03:10.870> it<00:03:11.079> when<00:03:11.230> you

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
and that's why it attacks it when you

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.860 
and that's why it attacks it when you
put<00:03:11.500> the<00:03:11.620> wrong<00:03:11.859> steroid<00:03:12.459> in<00:03:12.700> well<00:03:13.390> basically

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
put the wrong steroid in well basically

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.559 
put the wrong steroid in well basically
you<00:03:14.709> know<00:03:14.829> it's<00:03:15.069> like<00:03:15.220> a<00:03:15.250> kid<00:03:15.549> who<00:03:15.730> gets<00:03:15.879> a<00:03:16.150> one

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
you know it's like a kid who gets a one

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.659 
you know it's like a kid who gets a one
day<00:03:16.750> education<00:03:17.470> in<00:03:17.590> flying<00:03:17.890> a<00:03:18.069> plane<00:03:18.190> and<00:03:18.609> the

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:18.669 
day education in flying a plane and the

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:20.460 
day education in flying a plane and the
next<00:03:18.880> day<00:03:19.000> gets<00:03:19.269> them<00:03:19.450> to<00:03:19.569> a<00:03:19.599> Genesis<00:03:20.169> I<00:03:20.290> want

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
next day gets them to a Genesis I want

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.039 
next day gets them to a Genesis I want
to<00:03:20.560> fly<00:03:20.709> it<00:03:20.769> and<00:03:21.040> we<00:03:21.790> go<00:03:21.940> off<00:03:22.180> the<00:03:22.419> deep<00:03:22.599> end<00:03:22.780> and

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
to fly it and we go off the deep end and

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:24.659 
to fly it and we go off the deep end and
we<00:03:23.139> start<00:03:23.410> flying<00:03:23.709> around<00:03:24.040> in<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:24.280> sky<00:03:24.400> and

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:24.669 
we start flying around in the sky and

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:25.979 
we start flying around in the sky and
saying<00:03:24.940> we<00:03:25.030> know<00:03:25.150> everything<00:03:25.510> there<00:03:25.690> is<00:03:25.720> to

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
saying we know everything there is to

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.780 
saying we know everything there is to
know<00:03:26.019> about<00:03:26.260> vitamin<00:03:26.889> D<00:03:27.040> when<00:03:27.250> we<00:03:27.370> fed<00:03:27.549> a<00:03:27.579> one

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
know about vitamin D when we fed a one

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.360 
know about vitamin D when we fed a one
day<00:03:27.940> education<00:03:28.569> and<00:03:28.750> these<00:03:29.410> steroids<00:03:30.040> that

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
day education and these steroids that

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.520 
day education and these steroids that
they're<00:03:30.549> making<00:03:30.760> this<00:03:31.120> chemical<00:03:31.780> variety<00:03:32.440> of

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
they're making this chemical variety of

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.039 
they're making this chemical variety of
it<00:03:32.709> is<00:03:33.090> highly<00:03:34.090> dangerous<00:03:34.269> that's<00:03:34.780> why<00:03:34.989> it

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
it is highly dangerous that's why it

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.309 
it is highly dangerous that's why it
creates<00:03:35.440> deformity<00:03:36.160> in<00:03:36.630> infants<00:03:37.630> that's<00:03:38.049> why

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
creates deformity in infants that's why

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.280 
creates deformity in infants that's why
it<00:03:38.380> creates<00:03:38.919> potential<00:03:39.849> heart<00:03:40.690> attacks<00:03:41.019> and

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
it creates potential heart attacks and

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.770 
it creates potential heart attacks and
strokes<00:03:41.620> and<00:03:41.889> I<00:03:42.730> even<00:03:43.209> believe<00:03:43.450> it<00:03:43.599> has<00:03:43.750> a

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
strokes and I even believe it has a

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.990 
strokes and I even believe it has a
relationship<00:03:44.680> in<00:03:44.859> correlation<00:03:45.459> with<00:03:45.489> mental

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
relationship in correlation with mental

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.030 
relationship in correlation with mental
problems
