it's<00:00:39.390> very<00:00:39.629> good<00:00:39.890> two<00:00:40.890> ounces<00:00:46.969> next<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.059> little

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
it's very good two ounces next a little

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.880 
it's very good two ounces next a little
bit<00:00:48.449> of<00:00:48.539> sweetness<00:00:48.960> with<00:00:49.019> some<00:00:49.410> simple<00:00:49.739> syrup

not too much just half an ounce followed
by<00:00:55.679> which<00:00:55.980> I<00:00:56.129> think<00:00:56.370> really<00:00:56.550> makes<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.059> drink

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
by which I think really makes the drink

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:31.490 

squeeze<00:01:25.440> all<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.710> juice<00:01:26.370> out<00:01:27.350> go<00:01:28.610> add<00:01:30.500> that

and<00:01:31.740> you're<00:01:31.830> ready<00:01:32.010> to<00:01:32.250> blend<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.540> I'm

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
and you're ready to blend it so I'm

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.000 
and you're ready to blend it so I'm
going<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.810> blend<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.080> until<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.410> see<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.860> it's

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.010 
going to blend it until I see that it's

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.070 
going to blend it until I see that it's
smooth<00:01:35.370> there<00:01:36.000> might<00:01:36.210> be<00:01:36.240> some<00:01:36.540> chunks<00:01:36.840> left

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
smooth there might be some chunks left

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.230 
smooth there might be some chunks left
at<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.290> end<00:01:37.410> but<00:01:37.560> that's<00:01:37.740> okay<00:01:38.040> let's<00:01:38.940> see<00:01:39.120> how

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
at the end but that's okay let's see how

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.160 
at the end but that's okay let's see how
far<00:01:39.420> we<00:01:39.600> get<00:01:39.720> here

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:53.270 

I<00:01:49.909> think<00:01:50.909> that's<00:01:51.030> perfect<00:01:51.630> now<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.530> final

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
I think that's perfect now the final

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.639 
I think that's perfect now the final
touch<00:01:53.460> is<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.820> put<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.720> little<00:01:54.960> bit<00:01:55.110> of<00:01:55.290> lime

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
touch is to put a little bit of lime

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.620 
touch is to put a little bit of lime
juice<00:01:55.680> around<00:01:56.220> the<00:01:56.369> rim<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.790> make<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.119> sticky

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
juice around the rim to make it sticky

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.570 
juice around the rim to make it sticky
and<00:01:57.869> we're<00:01:58.350> going<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.560> put<00:01:58.740> sugar<00:01:58.979> on<00:01:59.220> it<00:01:59.250> you

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
and we're going to put sugar on it you

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.920 
and we're going to put sugar on it you
don't<00:01:59.729> have<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.060> do<00:02:00.149> this<00:02:00.270> but<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.540> think<00:02:00.810> that

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
don't have to do this but I think that

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.960 
don't have to do this but I think that
it<00:02:01.020> looks<00:02:01.049> really<00:02:01.500> pretty<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.430> also<00:02:02.610> adds

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
it looks really pretty and it also adds

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.999 
it looks really pretty and it also adds
just<00:02:03.539> a<00:02:03.720> nice<00:02:03.930> little<00:02:04.110> touch<00:02:04.380> of<00:02:04.530> sweetness<00:02:04.740> at

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
just a nice little touch of sweetness at

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.160 
just a nice little touch of sweetness at
the<00:02:05.130> end<00:02:05.420> okay<00:02:06.420> here<00:02:06.659> we<00:02:06.750> go

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
the end okay here we go

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.499 
the end okay here we go
and<00:02:08.160> don't<00:02:08.459> mind<00:02:08.610> any<00:02:08.759> chunks<00:02:09.179> we'll<00:02:09.300> just

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
and don't mind any chunks we'll just

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.199 
and don't mind any chunks we'll just
