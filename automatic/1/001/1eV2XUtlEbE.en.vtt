a way to learn that learn to do that is

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.389 
a way to learn that learn to do that is
to<00:01:01.530> ollie<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.699> put<00:01:02.879> your<00:01:02.999> hand<00:01:03.179> in<00:01:03.359> your<00:01:03.390> lap<00:01:03.659> I

try it put it in your lap like that it

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.999 
try it put it in your lap like that it
applied<00:01:11.009> at<00:01:11.310> first<00:01:11.579> you<00:01:11.729> look<00:01:11.850> back<00:01:12.090> but<00:01:13.009> below

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
applied at first you look back but below

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:15.620 
applied at first you look back but below
and<00:01:14.189> everything<00:01:14.490> but<00:01:14.700> as<00:01:15.180> long<00:01:15.329> as<00:01:15.479> it's

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
and everything but as long as it's

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.469 
and everything but as long as it's
flipping<00:01:16.369> it's<00:01:17.369> at<00:01:17.490> least<00:01:17.670> flipping<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.240> full

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
flipping it's at least flipping a full

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.899 
flipping it's at least flipping a full
rotation<00:01:18.689> or<00:01:19.290> over<00:01:19.560> flipping<00:01:19.920> then<00:01:20.670> you're

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
rotation or over flipping then you're

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.719 
rotation or over flipping then you're
you're<00:01:21.479> getting<00:01:21.719> the<00:01:21.840> flip<00:01:22.079> right<00:01:22.549> but<00:01:23.549> it's

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
you're getting the flip right but it's

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.580 
you're getting the flip right but it's
only<00:01:23.939> under<00:01:24.329> flipping<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:24.930> stuff<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.350> means

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
only under flipping and stuff that means

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.039 
only under flipping and stuff that means
you<00:01:25.680> need<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.860> get<00:01:25.979> better<00:01:26.340> at<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:27.049> flicking

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
you need to get better at that flicking

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.080 
you need to get better at that flicking
your<00:01:28.140> not<00:01:28.290> flicking<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.740> good<00:01:28.890> enough<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.909> once

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
your not flicking a good enough so once

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.270 
your not flicking a good enough so once
you<00:01:30.210> have<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.570> over<00:01:31.439> flipping<00:01:31.860> or<00:01:32.009> whatever

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
you have it over flipping or whatever

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.100 
you have it over flipping or whatever
that<00:01:32.759> means<00:01:32.909> you're<00:01:33.119> ready<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.509> try<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.869> lend

all right common problems with it is

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.880 
all right common problems with it is
under<00:01:58.220> flipping<00:01:58.610> which<00:01:59.170> it's<00:02:00.170> just<00:02:00.440> doing<00:02:00.800> a

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
under flipping which it's just doing a

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.350 
under flipping which it's just doing a
half<00:02:01.040> a<00:02:01.160> flip<00:02:01.400> is<00:02:01.580> either<00:02:01.730> because<00:02:02.090> you're

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
half a flip is either because you're

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.320 
half a flip is either because you're
catching<00:02:03.200> it<00:02:03.290> up<00:02:03.380> here<00:02:03.790> half<00:02:04.790> way<00:02:05.060> too<00:02:05.120> early

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.910 
catching it up here half way too early
and<00:02:06.200> that's<00:02:06.950> just<00:02:07.479> just<00:02:08.479> because<00:02:08.869> you're<00:02:09.830> just

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
and that's just just because you're just

catching it to him you gotta wait wait
to<00:02:12.290> flip<00:02:12.470> out<00:02:12.620> a<00:02:12.650> little<00:02:12.860> more<00:02:13.070> and<00:02:13.280> then<00:02:13.340> catch

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
to flip out a little more and then catch

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.440 
to flip out a little more and then catch
it<00:02:14.680> or<00:02:15.680> you're<00:02:16.550> just<00:02:16.580> not<00:02:16.880> flipping<00:02:17.270> right

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
it or you're just not flipping right

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.910 
it or you're just not flipping right
which<00:02:17.750> means<00:02:17.780> you're<00:02:18.260> not<00:02:18.380> hitting<00:02:18.620> it<00:02:18.800> off

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
which means you're not hitting it off

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.160 
which means you're not hitting it off
the<00:02:19.070> curvature<00:02:19.459> of<00:02:19.490> the<00:02:19.610> nose<00:02:19.820> right<00:02:20.980> and<00:02:23.170> you

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
the curvature of the nose right and you

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.420 
the curvature of the nose right and you
just<00:02:24.260> gotta<00:02:24.410> hit<00:02:24.830> it<00:02:24.950> right<00:02:25.070> you<00:02:25.250> may<00:02:25.370> be

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
just gotta hit it right you may be

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.040 
just gotta hit it right you may be
hitting<00:02:25.640> it<00:02:25.850> too<00:02:26.120> far<00:02:26.360> in<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.510> middle<00:02:26.720> like<00:02:26.840> an

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
hitting it too far in the middle like an

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.760 
hitting it too far in the middle like an
ollie<00:02:27.230> or<00:02:28.209> might<00:02:29.209> be<00:02:29.360> hitting<00:02:29.510> it<00:02:29.720> not<00:02:30.470> enough

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
ollie or might be hitting it not enough

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.880 
ollie or might be hitting it not enough
there<00:02:31.100> or<00:02:31.760> giving<00:02:32.390> it<00:02:32.480> enough<00:02:32.690> force<00:02:32.989> over

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
there or giving it enough force over

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.500 
there or giving it enough force over
flipping<00:02:34.280> is<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.520> other<00:02:34.610> problem<00:02:35.060> which<00:02:35.270> it

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
flipping is the other problem which it

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.600 
flipping is the other problem which it
just<00:02:35.720> means<00:02:35.900> you're<00:02:36.800> trying<00:02:37.100> to<00:02:37.190> flip<00:02:37.370> it<00:02:37.459> too

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
just means you're trying to flip it too

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.610 
just means you're trying to flip it too
hard<00:02:37.820> and<00:02:39.340> you<00:02:40.340> just<00:02:40.670> flip<00:02:40.910> it<00:02:41.000> easier<00:02:41.380> go<00:02:42.380> back

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
hard and you just flip it easier go back

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.650 
hard and you just flip it easier go back
to<00:02:42.770> putting<00:02:42.950> a<00:02:43.070> handle<00:02:43.459> up<00:02:43.640> and<00:02:44.390> when<00:02:44.510> it's

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
to putting a handle up and when it's

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.830 
to putting a handle up and when it's
about<00:02:45.410> flipping<00:02:45.980> maybe<00:02:46.190> just<00:02:46.550> one<00:02:46.760> over<00:02:47.120> then

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
about flipping maybe just one over then

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.570 
about flipping maybe just one over then
you're<00:02:48.260> getting<00:02:48.500> good<00:02:48.530> then<00:02:49.280> you're<00:02:49.489> not

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
you're getting good then you're not

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.050 
you're getting good then you're not
flipping<00:02:49.820> it<00:02:50.060> as<00:02:50.150> hard<00:02:50.360> and<00:02:50.540> stuff<00:02:51.310> but<00:02:52.310> you're

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
flipping it as hard and stuff but you're

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.250 
flipping it as hard and stuff but you're
just<00:02:53.239> trying<00:02:53.420> to<00:02:53.480> catch<00:02:53.570> it<00:02:53.810> if<00:02:53.989> you're

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
just trying to catch it if you're

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.390 
just trying to catch it if you're
overflowing<00:02:55.959> and<00:02:56.959> then<00:02:57.800> maybe<00:02:58.310> another

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
overflowing and then maybe another

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.130 
overflowing and then maybe another
problem<00:02:59.000> is<00:02:59.030> when<00:02:59.450> you're<00:02:59.570> done<00:02:59.690> like<00:02:59.870> a

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
problem is when you're done like a

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.229 
problem is when you're done like a
forward<00:03:00.739> flip<00:03:00.980> martyr<00:03:01.459> flip<00:03:01.640> dolphin<00:03:02.030> flip

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
forward flip martyr flip dolphin flip

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.090 
forward flip martyr flip dolphin flip
whatever<00:03:02.420> going<00:03:02.720> to<00:03:02.780> call<00:03:02.900> it<00:03:02.950> when<00:03:03.950> you're

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
whatever going to call it when you're

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.120 
whatever going to call it when you're
just<00:03:04.420> waiting<00:03:05.420> on<00:03:05.510> this<00:03:05.860> that's<00:03:06.860> pretty<00:03:07.010> much

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
just waiting on this that's pretty much

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.160 
just waiting on this that's pretty much
a<00:03:07.310> forward<00:03:07.549> flip<00:03:07.760> that<00:03:08.510> just<00:03:08.750> means<00:03:08.989> you're

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
a forward flip that just means you're

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.930 
a forward flip that just means you're
not<00:03:09.290> you're<00:03:09.560> flicking<00:03:09.830> straight<00:03:10.730> in<00:03:10.850> the

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
not you're flicking straight in the

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.460 
not you're flicking straight in the
center<00:03:11.239> and<00:03:12.250> we<00:03:13.250> need<00:03:13.400> to<00:03:13.489> flick<00:03:13.670> over<00:03:13.790> here<00:03:14.470> or

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
center and we need to flick over here or

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.009 
center and we need to flick over here or
you<00:03:16.010> might<00:03:16.130> be<00:03:16.280> doing<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.549> heelflip<00:03:17.019> that's

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
you might be doing the heelflip that's

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.530 
you might be doing the heelflip that's
because<00:03:18.320> you're<00:03:18.440> flicking<00:03:18.620> over<00:03:18.799> here

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
because you're flicking over here

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.170 
because you're flicking over here
flicking<00:03:20.540> on<00:03:20.630> this<00:03:20.840> side<00:03:21.430> over<00:03:22.430> here<00:03:22.549> instead

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
flicking on this side over here instead

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.840 
flicking on this side over here instead
of<00:03:23.239> right<00:03:23.450> here<00:03:24.430> and<00:03:25.430> you're<00:03:25.549> just<00:03:25.610> going<00:03:25.760> to

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
of right here and you're just going to

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.100 
of right here and you're just going to
flick<00:03:26.090> right<00:03:26.239> there<00:03:26.480> so<00:03:26.780> you're<00:03:26.959> going<00:03:27.049> to

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
flick right there so you're going to

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.410 
flick right there so you're going to
ollie<00:03:27.320> put<00:03:27.680> your<00:03:27.799> hand<00:03:28.010> here<00:03:28.180> put<00:03:29.180> your<00:03:29.269> hand

on your chest your lap whatever just
like<00:03:33.049> that<00:03:33.260> once<00:03:34.130> you<00:03:34.220> have<00:03:34.299> your<00:03:35.299> kick<00:03:35.480> foot

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
like that once you have your kick foot

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.020 
like that once you have your kick foot
pretty<00:03:35.870> good<00:03:36.080> then<00:03:36.500> try<00:03:37.220> catching<00:03:37.459> it<00:03:37.760> or

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
pretty good then try catching it or

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.519 
pretty good then try catching it or
landing<00:03:38.480> it<00:03:39.100> that's<00:03:40.100> pretty<00:03:40.280> much<00:03:40.400> it
