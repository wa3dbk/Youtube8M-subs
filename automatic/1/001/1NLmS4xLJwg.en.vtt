now<00:00:01.290> here's<00:00:01.589> an<00:00:01.740> experiment<00:00:02.129> I<00:00:02.520> have<00:00:02.700> my

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
now here's an experiment I have my

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.059 
now here's an experiment I have my
students<00:00:03.270> do<00:00:03.540> just<00:00:04.470> to<00:00:04.620> see<00:00:05.240> how<00:00:06.319> we<00:00:07.319> can<00:00:07.799> turn

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
students do just to see how we can turn

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.940 
students do just to see how we can turn
right<00:00:08.370> into<00:00:08.670> food<00:00:09.150> I<00:00:09.540> have<00:00:10.320> you<00:00:10.410> take<00:00:10.590> four

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
right into food I have you take four

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.440 
right into food I have you take four
jars<00:00:11.420> and<00:00:12.420> put<00:00:12.900> a<00:00:12.929> teaspoon<00:00:13.259> of<00:00:13.710> wheat<00:00:14.450> into

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
jars and put a teaspoon of wheat into

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.890 
jars and put a teaspoon of wheat into
each<00:00:15.690> jar<00:00:16.730> and<00:00:17.730> what<00:00:17.880> we're<00:00:18.060> going<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.270> do<00:00:18.510> is

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
each jar and what we're going to do is

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.150 
each jar and what we're going to do is
sprout<00:00:19.500> these<00:00:19.859> jars<00:00:20.330> one<00:00:21.330> day<00:00:21.570> at<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.720> time<00:00:22.160> so

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
sprout these jars one day at a time so

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.240 
sprout these jars one day at a time so
that<00:00:23.189> you<00:00:23.699> can<00:00:23.939> tell<00:00:24.269> when<00:00:25.230> it<00:00:25.470> becomes<00:00:25.800> food

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
that you can tell when it becomes food

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.849 
that you can tell when it becomes food
when<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.670> becomes<00:00:26.970> edible<00:00:27.599> so<00:00:28.349> if<00:00:28.529> you<00:00:28.650> put

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
when it becomes edible so if you put

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.339 
when it becomes edible so if you put
water<00:00:29.510> we're<00:00:30.510> going<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.689> put<00:00:30.840> water<00:00:31.050> in<00:00:31.260> the

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
water we're going to put water in the

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.639 
water we're going to put water in the
first<00:00:31.619> one<00:00:32.149> then<00:00:33.149> pour<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.690> out<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:34.230> let

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
first one then pour that out and let

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.889 
first one then pour that out and let
that<00:00:34.800> start<00:00:35.100> sprouting<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:36.090> first<00:00:36.360> day<00:00:36.600> and

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
that start sprouting the first day and

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.490 
that start sprouting the first day and
day<00:00:37.800> two<00:00:37.860> we'll<00:00:38.820> put<00:00:39.210> water<00:00:39.450> on<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:39.989> one<00:00:40.260> and

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
day two we'll put water on this one and

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.860 
day two we'll put water on this one and
let<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:40.860> start<00:00:41.160> sprouting<00:00:41.700> day<00:00:42.329> three<00:00:42.660> will

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
let that start sprouting day three will

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.869 
let that start sprouting day three will
put<00:00:43.050> water<00:00:43.260> on<00:00:43.350> this<00:00:43.620> one<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.160> so<00:00:44.370> on<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.820> so

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
put water on this one and so on and so

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.350 
put water on this one and so on and so
that<00:00:45.629> these<00:00:45.840> will<00:00:46.140> all<00:00:46.350> be<00:00:46.620> sprouting<00:00:47.059> day<00:00:48.059> one

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
that these will all be sprouting day one

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.930 
that these will all be sprouting day one
day<00:00:48.600> two<00:00:48.629> day<00:00:49.200> three<00:00:49.230> day<00:00:49.710> four<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.250> what<00:00:50.850> you

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
day two day three day four and what you

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.660 
day two day three day four and what you
can<00:00:51.120> do<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.420> actually<00:00:51.449> taste<00:00:52.140> them<00:00:52.500> each<00:00:53.250> day

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
can do is actually taste them each day

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.910 
can do is actually taste them each day
as<00:00:53.910> they<00:00:54.329> progress<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:55.199> they<00:00:55.379> get<00:00:55.530> sweeter

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
as they progress and they get sweeter

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.180 
as they progress and they get sweeter
and<00:00:56.219> softer<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.899> can<00:00:58.079> decide<00:00:58.410> well<00:00:58.859> I

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
and softer and you can decide well I

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.990 
and softer and you can decide well I
prefer<00:00:59.850> them<00:01:00.120> on<00:01:00.390> day<00:01:00.629> three<00:01:00.989> or<00:01:01.520> your<00:01:02.520> husband

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
prefer them on day three or your husband

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.870 
prefer them on day three or your husband
might<00:01:03.210> say<00:01:03.510> oh<00:01:03.719> they<00:01:04.080> for<00:01:04.409> for<00:01:04.680> me<00:01:04.860> but<00:01:05.700> the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
might say oh they for for me but the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.870 
might say oh they for for me but the
longer<00:01:06.330> they<00:01:06.510> stay<00:01:06.710> sprouting<00:01:07.710> they'll<00:01:08.640> have

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
longer they stay sprouting they'll have

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.390 
longer they stay sprouting they'll have
a<00:01:08.909> tail<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.659> tail<00:01:10.439> gets<00:01:10.860> longer<00:01:11.189> longer

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
a tail and the tail gets longer longer

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.730 
a tail and the tail gets longer longer
so<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:11.790> kind<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.270> looks<00:01:12.479> kind<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.869> weird<00:01:12.930> so

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
so that kind of looks kind of weird so

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.280 
so that kind of looks kind of weird so
you<00:01:13.820> usually<00:01:14.820> want<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.299> try<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.479> get<00:01:15.750> them<00:01:15.900> on

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
you usually want to try to get them on

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.260 
you usually want to try to get them on
about<00:01:16.530> day<00:01:16.710> 3<00:01:17.070> when<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.369> sprouts<00:01:17.759> are<00:01:17.970> short

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
about day 3 when the sprouts are short

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.630 
about day 3 when the sprouts are short
but<00:01:18.570> they're<00:01:19.290> nice<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.680> sweet<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:19.979> chewy<00:01:20.369> and

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
but they're nice and sweet and chewy and

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.820 
but they're nice and sweet and chewy and
then<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.420> can<00:01:21.570> add<00:01:21.810> them<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.200> anything<00:01:22.500> you

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
then you can add them to anything you

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.850 
then you can add them to anything you
can<00:01:22.860> add<00:01:23.130> them<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.490> your<00:01:23.689> salads<00:01:24.689> or<00:01:25.080> make<00:01:25.830> a

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
can add them to your salads or make a

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.520 
can add them to your salads or make a
salad<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.580> wheat<00:01:27.150> berry<00:01:27.360> salad<00:01:27.450> all<00:01:28.020> by<00:01:28.200> itself

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
salad of wheat berry salad all by itself

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.960 
salad of wheat berry salad all by itself
and<00:01:29.329> try<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.479> experiment<00:01:30.869> at<00:01:31.200> home<00:01:31.790> you<00:01:32.790> can

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
and try that experiment at home you can

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.060 
and try that experiment at home you can
use<00:01:33.150> any<00:01:33.360> cup<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:33.750> want<00:01:34.290> but<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:34.680> went<00:01:35.040> ahead

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
use any cup you want but I went ahead

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.310 
use any cup you want but I went ahead
and<00:01:35.250> used<00:01:35.369> half<00:01:35.759> points<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.930> cut<00:01:37.200> these

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
and used half points and I cut these

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.429 
and used half points and I cut these
screens<00:01:37.860> just<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.430> right<00:01:38.579> size<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.960> go<00:01:40.110> inside

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
screens just the right size to go inside

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.969 
screens just the right size to go inside
the<00:01:40.650> lid<00:01:41.119> screw<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.240> on<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.380> makes<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.829> so

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
the lid screw it on and that makes it so

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.679 
the lid screw it on and that makes it so
that<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.220> can<00:01:44.280> pour<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.880> water<00:01:45.060> out<00:01:45.210> without

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
that I can pour the water out without

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.039 
that I can pour the water out without
losing<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.829> wheat<00:01:47.250> inside<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.970> jar<00:01:48.210> then<00:01:48.899> I'm

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
losing the wheat inside the jar then I'm

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.870 
losing the wheat inside the jar then I'm
going<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.320> just<00:01:49.470> fill<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:50.070> up<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.490> little<00:01:50.670> bit

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
going to just fill it up a little bit

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:59.209 
going to just fill it up a little bit
and<00:01:56.119> spilling<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.479> little<00:01:57.719> bit<00:01:58.009> but<00:01:59.009> that's

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
and spilling a little bit but that's

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.940 
and spilling a little bit but that's
just<00:01:59.369> going<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.670> soak<00:01:59.909> up<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.149> grain<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.950> mean

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
just going to soak up that grain I mean

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.789 
just going to soak up that grain I mean
soak<00:02:02.280> up<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.520> water<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.329> grain<00:02:04.229> will<00:02:04.590> soak

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
soak up that water the grain will soak

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.399 
soak up that water the grain will soak
up<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.070> water<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.610> then<00:02:06.240> we'll<00:02:07.020> pour<00:02:07.200> that

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
up the water and then we'll pour that

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.109 
up the water and then we'll pour that

experiment just set it up take some out
of<00:03:04.080> this<00:03:04.290> jar<00:03:05.959> set<00:03:06.959> up<00:03:07.230> like<00:03:07.470> that<00:03:07.739> you<00:03:08.730> can<00:03:08.879> see

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
of this jar set up like that you can see

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.770 
of this jar set up like that you can see
that<00:03:09.239> this<00:03:09.360> has<00:03:09.629> much<00:03:10.140> longer<00:03:11.239> tails<00:03:12.239> if<00:03:12.750> you

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
that this has much longer tails if you

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.550 
that this has much longer tails if you
want<00:03:12.989> to<00:03:13.050> call<00:03:13.200> it<00:03:13.230> that<00:03:13.349> sprouts<00:03:14.090> then<00:03:15.090> these

and then kick this lid off and put some
out<00:03:20.519> here<00:03:22.489> those<00:03:23.489> don't<00:03:23.670> have<00:03:23.940> much<00:03:24.150> tails<00:03:24.480> at

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
out here those don't have much tails at

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.589 
out here those don't have much tails at
