00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.990
 people are giacomo and this is film 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.880
 and the kings the Italian portal that yes 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.010
 takes care of video magic and that with one 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.230
 snap of fingers brings you back to quality 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.639
 80's video in this video vi 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.929
 I'll talk about an object that a lot of 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:21.350
 Sometimes he saved my life 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.350
 the polaroid study is 256 led 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:34.440
 built what is needed is a light 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.700
 yes and it serves to illuminate separately 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.190
 the jokes let's talk about this product 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.840
 which is very useful indeed 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.420
 as I told you many times he saved me 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.629
 life because it not only makes a good impression 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.480
 light but is developed in width then 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.950
 maybe if you marry parties anyway 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.480
 or disco nights 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.550
 could be very useful for 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.440
 take pictures or take groups 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.570
 of people because I tell you that often 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.789
 this live saved my life because 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.100
 unlike such large LEDs this one 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.899
 here it does not make the slightest noise and this is 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.610
 very useful if you are in one 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.680
 recording studio or in a studio 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.869
 television something certainly very 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.970
 convenient of this led is that it is mounted on 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.729
 this support that allows you precisely 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.250
 to direct the light as you prefer 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.049
 also mounting the as I told you about a 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.009
 other support sun on a 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.840
 easel 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.820
 why choose this led rather 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.650
 that another where maybe there are more 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.900
 lights because this fruit all 256 le 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.409
 lights at the same time often you will find 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.570
 maybe LEDs with 320 LEDs though 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.210
 they have two different trimmers ie two 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.640
 different regulators one for warm lights 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.729
 one for cold lights which means that 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.740
 if there are 320 LEDs half are hot and 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.659
 half are cold so hardly 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.320
 make the most of the power of the 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.479
 your led 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.909
 at this time the led is set to 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.600
 minimum of power and we can see 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.909
 as with a simple gesture of the hand 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.000
 I can go increase the light here 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:06.899
 this is the light that can get to do 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.550
 it is powered by a npf 750 e battery 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.679
 you don't have to use those 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.100
 of the polaroid but also find others 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.600
 brands on amazon 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.520
 which are cheaper, for example 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.390
 I took this one that really lasts one 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.920
 a lot of time 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.360
 I leave the link in the description if 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.760
 you will buy this live in the box 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.530
 the power cord will come to you 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.630
 it is very useful if you just turned blog in 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.820
 home you can stick to the current 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.040
 without using the battery a filter 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.990
 yellow and a white filter is a 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.400
 adapter for thick current 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.530
 I collaborate with other people who 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.060
 they use led lights but in the end there 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.830
 we always find myself using mine 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.540
 because just a lot of light 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.100
 wider and this in my opinion is the 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.660
 greatest value 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.580
 honestly I do not find a fault a 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.440
 this product is two years that 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.360
 sky and use practically every 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.760
 time I go to shoot 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.220
 the only flaw is that just mounting it 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.950
 over the car with a battery the 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.570
 machine weight increases significantly 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.340
 I recommend this product not only to 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.560
 videomaker banks to photographers why 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.860
 often when taking pictures with flash 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.060
 then those ugly faces like that come out 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.250
 instead in this way with a light 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.990
 constant is positioned at the right point 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.000
 you will still get good ones 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.410
 good shooting photos without 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.910
 annoy the people you are 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.670
 in front I recommend this product 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.620
 really to all from the blogger that maybe 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.380
 lives in a small dark room without one 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.390
 window rather than the photographer at 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.400
 video maker that makes weddings oi 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.410
 services inside the discos in fact 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.880
 in the description of the video found 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.320
 all the links to buy the products 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.580
 of which I have spoken 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.290
 I remind you that I am part of 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.420
 amazon affiliate program does not 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.970
 I explain more what it is if you want to see 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.040
