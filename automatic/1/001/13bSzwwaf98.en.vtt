hello<00:00:02.909> I'm<00:00:03.270> going<00:00:03.419> to<00:00:03.480> try<00:00:03.629> to<00:00:03.689> bring<00:00:04.110> some

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
hello I'm going to try to bring some

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.190 
hello I'm going to try to bring some
clarity<00:00:04.740> to<00:00:04.770> the<00:00:05.549> gain<00:00:05.970> Expo<00:00:06.359> attitude<00:00:06.990> and

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
clarity to the gain Expo attitude and

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.500 
clarity to the gain Expo attitude and
brake<00:00:07.379> controls<00:00:07.859> they<00:00:08.550> seem<00:00:08.790> redundant<00:00:09.300> and

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
brake controls they seem redundant and

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.540 
brake controls they seem redundant and
overlapping<00:00:10.260> each<00:00:10.530> other<00:00:10.740> but<00:00:11.099> I<00:00:11.130> believe

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
overlapping each other but I believe

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.530 
overlapping each other but I believe
this<00:00:12.480> is<00:00:12.980> how<00:00:13.980> they<00:00:14.190> control<00:00:14.670> what<00:00:15.150> you<00:00:15.330> want

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
this is how they control what you want

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.730 
this is how they control what you want
the<00:00:16.379> bird<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.740> do<00:00:17.000> for<00:00:18.000> example<00:00:18.119> on<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.289> gain<00:00:19.500> X

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
the bird to do for example on the gain X

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.029 
the bird to do for example on the gain X
on<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.160> on<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.580> expo<00:00:21.199> the<00:00:22.199> controls<00:00:22.710> or<00:00:23.010> the

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
on the on the expo the controls or the

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.429 
on the on the expo the controls or the
sensitivity<00:00:23.850> of<00:00:24.029> your<00:00:24.570> manual<00:00:24.810> stick<00:00:25.109> input

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
sensitivity of your manual stick input

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.080 
sensitivity of your manual stick input
reaction<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:26.160> what<00:00:26.369> I've<00:00:26.460> found<00:00:26.670> the

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
reaction is what I've found the

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.030 
reaction is what I've found the
situation<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.840> be<00:00:28.010> so<00:00:29.750> if<00:00:30.750> for<00:00:30.929> example<00:00:31.019> if<00:00:31.890> you

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
situation to be so if for example if you

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.180 
situation to be so if for example if you
have<00:00:32.219> them<00:00:32.369> set<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.640> 0.3<00:00:33.540> oh<00:00:33.980> what's<00:00:34.980> going<00:00:35.160> to

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
have them set to 0.3 oh what's going to

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.180 
have them set to 0.3 oh what's going to
happen<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.820> it's<00:00:36.180> going<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.360> be<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:37.190> less

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
happen is it's going to be a less

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.110 
happen is it's going to be a less
aggressive<00:00:38.570> approach<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:40.370> the<00:00:41.370> manual<00:00:41.760> input

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
aggressive approach to the manual input

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.779 
aggressive approach to the manual input
entry<00:00:42.620> so<00:00:43.620> if<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.640> are<00:00:45.350> going<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.500> move<00:00:46.920> for

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
entry so if you are going to move for

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.139 
entry so if you are going to move for
example<00:00:48.980> the<00:00:49.980> case<00:00:50.309> well<00:00:50.640> let's<00:00:50.850> just<00:00:51.030> say

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
example the case well let's just say

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.330 
example the case well let's just say
throttle<00:00:51.660> if<00:00:52.469> you're<00:00:52.649> going<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.860> throttle<00:00:53.070> up

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
throttle if you're going to throttle up

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.290 
throttle if you're going to throttle up
and<00:00:53.520> go<00:00:53.610> up<00:00:54.559> the<00:00:55.559> amount<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:55.949> gain<00:00:56.219> in<00:00:56.520> the

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
and go up the amount of gain in the

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.330 
and go up the amount of gain in the
amount<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.629> movement<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.199> your<00:00:58.320> finger<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.949> in

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
amount of movement of your finger and in

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.970 
amount of movement of your finger and in
relation<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.480> amount<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.989> input<00:01:01.649> into<00:01:01.859> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
relation to the amount of input into the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.560 
relation to the amount of input into the
engines<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.750> softened<00:01:04.369> okay<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:05.430> if<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.330> gain

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
engines is softened okay so if the gain

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.140 
engines is softened okay so if the gain
if<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.260> sorry<00:01:07.770> if<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.010> expo<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.610> higher

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
if the sorry if the expo is higher

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.250 
if the sorry if the expo is higher
say<00:01:09.510> for<00:01:09.720> example<00:01:09.750> point<00:01:10.590> 4<00:01:10.860> or<00:01:11.280> 0.5<00:01:11.900> then<00:01:12.900> for

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
say for example point 4 or 0.5 then for

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.499 
say for example point 4 or 0.5 then for
each<00:01:13.380> movement<00:01:13.820> the<00:01:14.820> reaction<00:01:15.360> will<00:01:15.479> be

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
each movement the reaction will be

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:22.160 
each movement the reaction will be
quicker<00:01:16.220> the<00:01:17.220> lower<00:01:18.619> the<00:01:19.909> expo<00:01:20.909> point<00:01:21.509> 3<00:01:21.810> the

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
quicker the lower the expo point 3 the

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.260 
quicker the lower the expo point 3 the
further<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:23.040> have<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.340> travel<00:01:23.610> in<00:01:23.909> order<00:01:24.090> to

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
further you have to travel in order to

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.289 
further you have to travel in order to
get<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.540> same<00:01:24.780> reaction<00:01:25.400> okay<00:01:26.780> now<00:01:29.240> so<00:01:30.240> you

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
get the same reaction okay now so you

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.969 
get the same reaction okay now so you
say<00:01:30.570> well<00:01:30.780> if<00:01:30.900> that's<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.200> case<00:01:31.290> well<00:01:31.710> what<00:01:31.829> is

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
say well if that's the case well what is

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.219 
say well if that's the case well what is
attitude<00:01:32.250> do<00:01:32.960> attitude<00:01:33.960> for<00:01:34.920> example<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:36.229> the

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
attitude do attitude for example is the

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.830 
attitude do attitude for example is the
reaction<00:01:37.680> of<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.860> craft<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.270> reaction<00:01:39.720> of

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
reaction of the craft to the reaction of

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.700 
reaction of the craft to the reaction of
the<00:01:39.930> stick<00:01:40.259> okay<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.670> expo<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.600> more<00:01:42.930> humph<00:01:43.530> is

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
the stick okay so expo is more humph is

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.940 
the stick okay so expo is more humph is
more<00:01:44.220> controlling<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:45.110> how<00:01:46.110> does<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.380> react<00:01:46.680> in

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
more controlling of how does it react in

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.679 
more controlling of how does it react in
relation<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.369> how<00:01:47.549> far<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:47.970> move<00:01:48.329> with<00:01:48.540> the

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
relation to how far you move with the

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.760 
relation to how far you move with the
stick<00:01:49.460> attitude<00:01:50.460> is<00:01:50.729> when<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:51.960> put<00:01:52.619> that

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
stick attitude is when you put that

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.709 
stick attitude is when you put that
reaction<00:01:53.100> in<00:01:53.430> how<00:01:54.799> how<00:01:55.799> aggressively<00:01:56.719> does

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
reaction in how how aggressively does

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.810 
reaction in how how aggressively does
the<00:01:57.869> craft<00:01:58.140> move<00:01:58.500> in<00:01:58.799> relation<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.579> that

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
the craft move in relation to that

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.350 
the craft move in relation to that
action<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:00.930> expo<00:02:01.590> how<00:02:02.399> far<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:02.909> need<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.119> move

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
action so expo how far you need to move

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.980 
action so expo how far you need to move
to<00:02:03.420> make<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:04.020> happen<00:02:04.549> attitude<00:02:05.549> how<00:02:06.210> fast<00:02:06.630> does

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
to make it happen attitude how fast does

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.350 
to make it happen attitude how fast does
a<00:02:07.049> craft<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.560> react<00:02:07.799> does<00:02:08.640> this<00:02:08.940> how<00:02:09.149> fast

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
a craft you react does this how fast

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.380 
a craft you react does this how fast
does<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.810> craft<00:02:10.110> react<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.489> movement

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
does the craft react to that movement

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.310 
does the craft react to that movement
and<00:02:12.660> then<00:02:13.140> finally<00:02:13.650> gain<00:02:15.680> gain<00:02:16.680> would<00:02:16.890> be

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
and then finally gain gain would be

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.860 
and then finally gain gain would be
given<00:02:19.320> that<00:02:19.500> input<00:02:20.060> what<00:02:21.060> is<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.210> maximum

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
given that input what is the maximum

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.380 
given that input what is the maximum
range<00:02:22.260> of<00:02:22.620> how<00:02:23.310> far<00:02:23.640> that<00:02:23.850> will<00:02:23.970> go<00:02:24.150> for

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
range of how far that will go for

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.050 
range of how far that will go for
example<00:02:24.810> 4<00:02:25.020> yah<00:02:25.230> I<00:02:25.500> like<00:02:25.890> y'all<00:02:26.190> to<00:02:26.400> be<00:02:26.820> lower

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
example 4 yah I like y'all to be lower

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.480 
example 4 yah I like y'all to be lower
so<00:02:27.810> if<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.140> cab<00:02:28.350> camera<00:02:28.950> movements<00:02:29.370> are

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490

it<00:02:34.440> will<00:02:34.710> only<00:02:34.830> move<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.700> a<00:02:35.730> certain

input<00:02:43.590> if<00:02:44.070> it's<00:02:45.060> higher<00:02:45.590> then<00:02:46.880> obviously<00:02:47.880> it

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
input if it's higher then obviously it

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.040

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
will be it will be faster so with the

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
three settings what you can do is expo

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.150 
three settings what you can do is expo
will<00:02:55.709> give<00:02:56.250> you<00:02:56.430> a<00:02:56.459> lower<00:02:56.790> expo<00:02:57.239> point<00:02:58.170> 3<00:02:58.470> will

will give you a lower expo point 3 will

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.490 
will give you a lower expo point 3 will
give<00:02:59.370> you<00:02:59.520> a<00:02:59.580> more<00:02:59.790> graceful<00:03:00.060> soft<00:03:00.720> gooey<00:03:01.110> fill

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
give you a more graceful soft gooey fill

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.729 
give you a more graceful soft gooey fill
okay<00:03:04.250> attitude<00:03:05.989> within<00:03:06.989> that<00:03:07.170> gooey<00:03:07.410> fill

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
okay attitude within that gooey fill

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.660

attitude<00:03:08.430> will<00:03:09.270> react<00:03:09.750> more<00:03:10.650> quickly<00:03:10.709> or<00:03:11.340> less

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
quickly to your reaction and then gain

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.880

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.560 
will be how far does it move with
reaction<00:03:20.459> with<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:20.970> input<00:03:21.269> that<00:03:21.299> you've

reaction with the input that you've

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.690 
reaction with the input that you've
given<00:03:21.900> it<00:03:22.019> so<00:03:22.920> with<00:03:23.160> that<00:03:23.280> being<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:23.670> case

given it so with that being the case

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.789 
given it so with that being the case
what<00:03:24.299> I've<00:03:24.390> found<00:03:24.660> for<00:03:24.810> me<00:03:24.989> I<00:03:25.200> like<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:25.590> have

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
what I've found for me I like to have

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.910 
what I've found for me I like to have
relatively<00:03:26.580> soft<00:03:26.970> controls<00:03:27.590> but<00:03:28.590> I<00:03:28.620> still

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
relatively soft controls but I still

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.610 
relatively soft controls but I still
want<00:03:29.190> some<00:03:29.610> aggressiveness<00:03:30.330> to<00:03:30.480> over<00:03:30.720> come

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
want some aggressiveness to over come

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.560 
want some aggressiveness to over come
wind<00:03:31.890> currents<00:03:32.400> and<00:03:32.580> various<00:03:32.940> obstacle

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
wind currents and various obstacle

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.199 
wind currents and various obstacle
avoidance<00:03:33.660> and<00:03:34.200> things<00:03:34.350> like<00:03:34.530> that<00:03:34.590> so<00:03:35.209> the

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
avoidance and things like that so the

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:37.370 
avoidance and things like that so the
best<00:03:36.360> of<00:03:36.540> both<00:03:36.720> worlds

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.070 
best of both worlds
at<00:03:37.500> least<00:03:37.739> for<00:03:37.950> now<00:03:37.980> I've<00:03:38.400> found<00:03:38.910> and<00:03:39.900> it's

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
at least for now I've found and it's

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.699 
at least for now I've found and it's
it's<00:03:40.380> it's<00:03:40.769> a<00:03:40.920> it's<00:03:40.950> a<00:03:41.640> balancing<00:03:42.090> act<00:03:42.680> what<00:03:43.680> I

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
it's it's a it's a balancing act what I

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.270 
it's it's a it's a balancing act what I
did<00:03:43.980> is<00:03:44.100> I<00:03:44.250> set<00:03:44.519> it<00:03:44.640> to<00:03:44.670> 0.4<00:03:45.660> on<00:03:45.930> all<00:03:46.769> three<00:03:47.130> of

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
did is I set it to 0.4 on all three of

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.750 
did is I set it to 0.4 on all three of
the<00:03:47.400> of<00:03:47.580> the<00:03:47.850> expose<00:03:48.860> point<00:03:49.860> 4<00:03:50.100> is<00:03:50.280> somewhat<00:03:50.640> in

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
the of the expose point 4 is somewhat in

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.479 
the of the expose point 4 is somewhat in
the<00:03:50.850> middle<00:03:50.910> so<00:03:51.330> it<00:03:51.480> offers<00:03:51.630> a<00:03:52.130> pretty<00:03:53.130> tight

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
the middle so it offers a pretty tight

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.560 
the middle so it offers a pretty tight
line<00:03:53.989> to<00:03:54.989> a<00:03:55.019> linear<00:03:55.680> curve<00:03:56.060> meaning<00:03:57.060> that<00:03:57.269> it's

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570

almost it's almost linear but it's a

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.970 
almost it's almost linear but it's a
little<00:04:01.170> lazy<00:04:01.790> to<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:03.030> reaction<00:04:03.660> of<00:04:03.980> your

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010

it's<00:04:08.010> going<00:04:08.220> to<00:04:08.310> react<00:04:08.549> slower<00:04:09.060> at<00:04:09.299> 0.4<00:04:09.810> 0.3

it's going to react slower at 0.4 0.3

it's going to react slower at 0.4 0.3
even<00:04:11.100> slower<00:04:11.400> still<00:04:11.760> 0.5<00:04:12.360> will<00:04:13.049> be<00:04:13.170> faster<00:04:14.510> ok

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
even slower still 0.5 will be faster ok

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
it's getting to the point where you

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.450 
it's getting to the point where you
could<00:04:50.970> be<00:04:51.090> sent<00:04:51.360> off<00:04:51.450> course<00:04:51.810> a<00:04:52.080> good<00:04:53.040> 10-15

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
could be sent off course a good 10-15

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.220 
could be sent off course a good 10-15
feet<00:04:53.760> before<00:04:54.180> it<00:04:54.420> breaks<00:04:54.600> and<00:04:54.870> that's<00:04:55.050> it

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 
feet before it breaks and that's it

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.250 
feet before it breaks and that's it
you're<00:04:55.530> done<00:04:55.640> so<00:04:56.640> I<00:04:56.700> keep<00:04:56.970> it<00:04:57.120> at<00:04:57.240> 90<00:04:57.630> to<00:04:57.900> soften

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
you're done so I keep it at 90 to soften

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.220 
you're done so I keep it at 90 to soften
the<00:04:59.100> break<00:04:59.570> instead<00:05:00.570> of<00:05:00.690> a<00:05:00.810> hundred<00:05:01.050> percent

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
the break instead of a hundred percent

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.100 
the break instead of a hundred percent
it's<00:05:01.620> like<00:05:02.070> this<00:05:02.280> 80<00:05:03.060> percent<00:05:03.600> it<00:05:03.720> goes<00:05:03.870> too

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
it's like this 80 percent it goes too

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.130 
it's like this 80 percent it goes too
far<00:05:04.410> and<00:05:04.670> 90<00:05:05.670> percent<00:05:05.700> gives<00:05:06.240> kind<00:05:06.480> of<00:05:06.570> a<00:05:06.690> cushy

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
far and 90 percent gives kind of a cushy

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.120 
far and 90 percent gives kind of a cushy
so<00:05:07.980> it's<00:05:08.790> about<00:05:08.970> a<00:05:09.030> five<00:05:09.330> foot<00:05:09.600> ride<00:05:09.860> to<00:05:10.860> stop

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
so it's about a five foot ride to stop

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.710 
so it's about a five foot ride to stop
and<00:05:12.260> then<00:05:13.260> the<00:05:13.380> gains<00:05:14.150> when<00:05:15.150> I<00:05:15.180> put<00:05:15.390> the<00:05:15.480> gains

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
and then the gains when I put the gains

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.580 
and then the gains when I put the gains
at<00:05:16.020> is<00:05:16.890> I<00:05:17.820> put<00:05:18.120> a<00:05:18.360> left<00:05:18.750> pitch<00:05:19.050> in<00:05:19.230> a<00:05:19.290> hundred

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
at is I put a left pitch in a hundred

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.790 
at is I put a left pitch in a hundred
percent<00:05:19.710> roll<00:05:20.610> at<00:05:20.730> a<00:05:20.790> hundred<00:05:21.000> percent<00:05:21.530> yah<00:05:22.530> I

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
percent roll at a hundred percent yah I

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.640 
percent roll at a hundred percent yah I
took<00:05:23.190> it<00:05:23.310> down<00:05:23.430> to<00:05:23.490> 90<00:05:24.060> percent<00:05:24.510> and<00:05:24.690> vertical

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
took it down to 90 percent and vertical

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.200 
took it down to 90 percent and vertical
I<00:05:25.890> believe<00:05:26.130> I<00:05:26.250> backed<00:05:26.490> it<00:05:26.669> off<00:05:26.760> just<00:05:27.030> slightly

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
I believe I backed it off just slightly

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.500 
I believe I backed it off just slightly
to<00:05:27.660> 95<00:05:28.200> and<00:05:28.230> I'll<00:05:28.530> tell<00:05:28.710> you<00:05:28.800> why<00:05:29.150> the<00:05:30.150> reason

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
to 95 and I'll tell you why the reason

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.310 
to 95 and I'll tell you why the reason
why<00:05:30.630> did<00:05:30.720> these<00:05:30.990> combinations<00:05:31.740> is<00:05:31.980> because<00:05:32.370> on

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
why did these combinations is because on

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.250 
why did these combinations is because on
throttle<00:05:34.320> for<00:05:34.500> example<00:05:34.919> I<00:05:35.220> have<00:05:36.120> I<00:05:36.480> have<00:05:37.140> it

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
throttle for example I have I have it

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.050 
throttle for example I have I have it
set<00:05:37.470> a<00:05:37.500> little<00:05:37.680> more<00:05:37.919> aggressively<00:05:38.340> 0.4

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
set a little more aggressively 0.4

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.040 
set a little more aggressively 0.4
because<00:05:39.330> I<00:05:39.419> want<00:05:39.690> a<00:05:39.870> good<00:05:40.260> input<00:05:41.180> reaction<00:05:42.180> so

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
because I want a good input reaction so

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.200 
because I want a good input reaction so
in<00:05:43.140> other<00:05:43.229> words<00:05:43.500> when<00:05:44.040> I<00:05:44.070> move<00:05:44.400> I<00:05:44.700> want<00:05:44.940> it<00:05:45.090> to

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
in other words when I move I want it to

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.620 
in other words when I move I want it to
react<00:05:45.860> relatively<00:05:46.860> quickly<00:05:47.150> but<00:05:48.150> to<00:05:48.419> that

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
react relatively quickly but to that

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.830 
react relatively quickly but to that
reaction<00:05:49.020> I<00:05:49.470> don't<00:05:50.310> want<00:05:50.550> the<00:05:50.840> total

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
reaction I don't want the total

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.010 
reaction I don't want the total
percentage<00:05:52.290> or<00:05:52.770> the<00:05:53.160> total<00:05:53.400> gain<00:05:53.760> to<00:05:54.570> be<00:05:54.780> a

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
percentage or the total gain to be a

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.600 
percentage or the total gain to be a
hundred<00:05:55.290> percent<00:05:55.410> anymore<00:05:56.010> I<00:05:56.040> want<00:05:56.310> it<00:05:56.370> to<00:05:56.490> be

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610 
hundred percent anymore I want it to be

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.540 
hundred percent anymore I want it to be
a<00:05:56.640> little<00:05:56.910> lazy<00:05:57.240> in<00:05:57.630> the<00:05:57.870> energy<00:05:58.229> input<00:05:58.620> but<00:05:59.520> I

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550 
a little lazy in the energy input but I

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.840 
a little lazy in the energy input but I
want<00:05:59.850> my<00:06:00.000> reaction<00:06:00.720> time<00:06:01.040> for<00:06:02.040> stick<00:06:02.250> input<00:06:02.729> to

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:02.850 
want my reaction time for stick input to

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:04.159 
want my reaction time for stick input to
be<00:06:03.000> more<00:06:03.240> precise<00:06:03.630> and<00:06:03.900> quick

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
be more precise and quick

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:06.440 
be more precise and quick
so<00:06:04.830> the<00:06:04.979> to<00:06:05.160> work<00:06:05.460> hand-in-hand<00:06:05.880> with<00:06:06.210> each

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.450 
so the to work hand-in-hand with each

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.770 
so the to work hand-in-hand with each
other<00:06:06.720> so<00:06:07.620> a<00:06:07.760> little<00:06:08.760> bit<00:06:08.910> of<00:06:09.030> a<00:06:09.120> higher<00:06:09.360> gain

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 
other so a little bit of a higher gain

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.740 
other so a little bit of a higher gain
and<00:06:10.110> a<00:06:10.860> little<00:06:11.100> bit<00:06:11.220> of<00:06:11.340> a<00:06:11.370> lower<00:06:11.850> energy<00:06:12.150> input

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
and a little bit of a lower energy input

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.990 
and a little bit of a lower energy input
I'm<00:06:12.990> sorry<00:06:13.530> Expo<00:06:13.919> a<00:06:14.100> little<00:06:14.550> bit<00:06:14.640> of<00:06:14.760> a<00:06:14.820> higher

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
I'm sorry Expo a little bit of a higher

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.520 
I'm sorry Expo a little bit of a higher

Expo and a little bit of a lower energy
gain<00:06:17.040> input<00:06:17.600> will<00:06:18.600> balance<00:06:19.050> one<00:06:19.200> another<00:06:19.229> just

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710 
gain input will balance one another just

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.620 
gain input will balance one another just
kind<00:06:19.979> of<00:06:20.100> soften<00:06:20.610> it<00:06:20.760> but<00:06:21.090> still<00:06:21.300> give<00:06:21.479> you

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630 
kind of soften it but still give you

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.350 
kind of soften it but still give you
accuracy<00:06:22.050> in<00:06:22.350> your<00:06:22.470> reaction

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 
accuracy in your reaction

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.630 
accuracy in your reaction
rolling<00:06:25.140> pitch<00:06:25.410> I<00:06:25.740> like<00:06:26.070> to<00:06:26.220> keep<00:06:26.370> it<00:06:26.580> a

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:26.640 
rolling pitch I like to keep it a

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.730 
rolling pitch I like to keep it a
hundred<00:06:26.850> percent<00:06:26.970> gain<00:06:27.570> because<00:06:28.080> I<00:06:28.110> want

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:28.740 
hundred percent gain because I want

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.190 
hundred percent gain because I want
there<00:06:28.950> to<00:06:28.979> be<00:06:29.160> the<00:06:29.460> ability<00:06:29.669> to<00:06:30.120> maneuver<00:06:31.020> if<00:06:31.080> I

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:31.200 
there to be the ability to maneuver if I

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.400 
there to be the ability to maneuver if I
need<00:06:31.380> to<00:06:31.789> but<00:06:32.789> it's<00:06:33.210> been<00:06:33.390> softened<00:06:33.930> by<00:06:34.380> the

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:34.410 
need to but it's been softened by the

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:38.210 
need to but it's been softened by the
expo<00:06:34.919> 20.4%<00:06:36.050> so<00:06:37.050> that<00:06:37.349> I<00:06:37.620> have

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.220 
expo 20.4% so that I have

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.080 
expo 20.4% so that I have
to<00:06:38.720> travel<00:06:39.720> further<00:06:40.310> with<00:06:41.310> my<00:06:41.460> finger<00:06:41.850> to

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:42.090 
to travel further with my finger to

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:44.780 
to travel further with my finger to
actually<00:06:42.450> have<00:06:43.230> a<00:06:43.260> reaction<00:06:43.920> but<00:06:44.340> if<00:06:44.430> I<00:06:44.550> really

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:44.790 
actually have a reaction but if I really

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:48.020 
actually have a reaction but if I really
need<00:06:45.090> to<00:06:45.330> it's<00:06:46.170> still<00:06:46.470> there<00:06:46.650> for<00:06:46.890> me<00:06:46.950> but<00:06:47.880> it's

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:48.030 
need to it's still there for me but it's

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.750 
need to it's still there for me but it's
a<00:06:48.120> little<00:06:48.330> softer<00:06:49.430> okay<00:06:50.430> and<00:06:50.550> then<00:06:50.640> the

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:50.760 
a little softer okay and then the

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:55.540 
a little softer okay and then the
attitude<00:06:51.710> which<00:06:52.710> is<00:06:52.740> the<00:06:53.100> aggressiveness<00:06:53.850> of

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:55.550 
attitude which is the aggressiveness of

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:01.150 
attitude which is the aggressiveness of
the<00:06:56.550> reaction<00:06:57.150> to<00:06:57.390> the<00:06:57.540> input<00:06:57.960> at<00:06:58.830> 90%

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:01.160 
the reaction to the input at 90%

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:06.770 
the reaction to the input at 90%
that<00:07:02.160> will<00:07:02.430> slow<00:07:03.060> and<00:07:03.510> ease<00:07:05.120> the<00:07:06.120> reaction<00:07:06.660> of

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:06.780 
that will slow and ease the reaction of

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:11.110 
that will slow and ease the reaction of
the<00:07:06.930> craft<00:07:07.230> to<00:07:07.940> the<00:07:08.940> slowness<00:07:09.300> of<00:07:09.480> the<00:07:10.320> input

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120 
the craft to the slowness of the input

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.150 
the craft to the slowness of the input
so<00:07:12.120> I<00:07:12.480> know<00:07:12.810> that's<00:07:13.110> a<00:07:13.170> lot<00:07:13.320> of<00:07:13.410> information<00:07:14.040> I

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 
so I know that's a lot of information I

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.580 
so I know that's a lot of information I
hope<00:07:14.310> it<00:07:14.490> helps<00:07:14.820> but<00:07:15.230> that's<00:07:16.230> what<00:07:16.470> I've

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:16.590 
hope it helps but that's what I've

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:18.770 
hope it helps but that's what I've
worked<00:07:16.770> through<00:07:17.040> it<00:07:17.250> and<00:07:17.430> I<00:07:18.000> found<00:07:18.360> that<00:07:18.600> that

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:18.780 
worked through it and I found that that

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.740 
worked through it and I found that that
is<00:07:18.840> how<00:07:19.410> you<00:07:19.470> use<00:07:19.950> those<00:07:20.700> three<00:07:20.970> variables<00:07:21.540> to

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:21.750 
is how you use those three variables to

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:24.140 
is how you use those three variables to
arrive<00:07:22.020> at<00:07:22.260> your<00:07:22.290> perfect<00:07:22.740> situation<00:07:23.070> so<00:07:23.940> just

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:24.150 
arrive at your perfect situation so just

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:28.370 
arrive at your perfect situation so just
to<00:07:24.240> review<00:07:24.390> again<00:07:24.980> Expo<00:07:25.980> will<00:07:26.580> be<00:07:26.990> how<00:07:27.990> fast

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:28.380 
to review again Expo will be how fast

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:32.030 
to review again Expo will be how fast
your<00:07:28.770> actual<00:07:29.100> manual<00:07:29.550> sticks<00:07:29.970> react<00:07:30.860> to<00:07:31.860> your

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:32.040 
your actual manual sticks react to your

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.540 
your actual manual sticks react to your
entry<00:07:32.900> attitude<00:07:33.900> is<00:07:34.110> how<00:07:34.470> fast<00:07:34.740> the<00:07:34.919> crafter

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:35.550 
entry attitude is how fast the crafter

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:40.730 
entry attitude is how fast the crafter
reacts<00:07:35.850> to<00:07:36.270> those<00:07:36.480> stick<00:07:36.810> inputs<00:07:38.300> break<00:07:39.740> again

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:40.740 
reacts to those stick inputs break again

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.380 
reacts to those stick inputs break again
we<00:07:41.160> went<00:07:41.370> through<00:07:41.580> that<00:07:41.760> that's<00:07:41.910> pretty<00:07:42.300> much

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:42.390 
we went through that that's pretty much

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:45.260 
we went through that that's pretty much
self-explanatory<00:07:42.810> and<00:07:43.620> then<00:07:44.400> your<00:07:44.550> gains<00:07:44.850> are

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:45.270 
self-explanatory and then your gains are

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:51.470 
self-explanatory and then your gains are
how<00:07:45.840> far<00:07:46.200> will<00:07:46.590> it<00:07:46.620> go<00:07:47.690> given<00:07:48.690> a<00:07:48.840> certain<00:07:49.230> input
