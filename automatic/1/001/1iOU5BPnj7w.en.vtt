00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.920
 has the great idea after 20 years 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.020
 but once again brought together 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.469

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.880

 Side role in shaun of the dead and and 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:32.780
 really great actor and he was too 

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:34.759
 actually the reason I have that 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.829
 I've got him 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.670
 at the dealer of my confidence 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:41.509
 see original box for three euros 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.799
 by the cover I actually have 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.170
 Not much expected when you look at the 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.819
 guys look at what you maybe why 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.880
 I have a few plate gags 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:51.529
 really nothing great 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.409
 very good maybe a few times 

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:56.420
 smirking maybe really okay 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:59.149
 yes, but it can be very different 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.159
 really great movie is really ans ans 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.960
 heart one has a smile the whole 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.020
 time in 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.670
 not that is just great there 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.350
 characters simply wins the easy dear 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.200
 they do not give a damn to me like in 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:14.220
 many others film and great 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.720
 played and what we do say must 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.130
 the actors really sing themselves 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.800
 You do not have that often 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.000
 and they are doing really well me 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.600
 I was allowed to actually 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.370
 love singing, he was also quite funny 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.080
 to watch 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.290
 and yes as I said here 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.530
 crazy situations are great 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.230
 Music is absolutely great music for that 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.820
 that it really 'ne fictitious tape is the 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.160
 sound better than some big ones 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.989
 The bands in the top 100 regularly 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.190
 are represented 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.080
 I would like to recommend you too 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:51.550
 maybe you have a look 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:54.760
 on youtube strange fruit that's it 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.200
 worst burns and oliver kobold 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.600
 maybe you can get one already 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.800
 make a small impression of the movie like 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.959
 that many of you may know him 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.890
 but as they do not know 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.900
 absolutely have a look and everyone 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.299
 give my chance I have the 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.000
 even on rainy sunday afternoon 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:14.829
 before 66 years I think because it was so 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.150
 I threw myself in the 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:18.310
 player and as I said not much 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:23.320
 expected and I only had it right afterwards 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:24.549
 again in English looked friend 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.630
 I have recommended the movie we have 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.660
 him the next yet again together 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.070
 of the next day looked out and has 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.959
 bought the synonymous but also very much 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.060
 enthusiastic and I think that applies 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:37.720
 maybe many because he ran 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.489
 At some point it ran on 3sat mdr ndr 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.380
 I did not know what 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.940
 I've got a random transmitter by chance 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.930
 seen in the tv newspaper that he is there 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.519
 ran the film somehow not 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.900
 So I deserve it should be real 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:53.140
 made available to a wider audience 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.760
 if I think that sometimes 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.349
 really really a jerk look at the 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.090
 the otherwise 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:01.610
 on TV it keeps running 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.579
 repeated trouble to four times a year the 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:07.970
 Hollywood cops run or super cute and 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:09.890

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:36.560

 I think the film is good 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.750

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:44.360
