number at work yeah well what happens

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.029 
number at work yeah well what happens
when<00:04:31.030> you<00:04:31.240> place<00:04:31.419> a<00:04:31.449> block<00:04:31.750> of<00:04:31.930> of<00:04:32.050> it<00:04:32.199> as<00:04:32.770> long

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 
when you place a block of of it as long

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:36.270 
when you place a block of of it as long
as<00:04:33.130> it's<00:04:33.250> not<00:04:33.310> glass<00:04:33.750> at<00:04:34.750> one<00:04:35.020> connect<00:04:35.440> so<00:04:35.830> it's

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
as it's not glass at one connect so it's

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.070 
as it's not glass at one connect so it's
basically<00:04:36.940> Sables<00:04:37.510> the<00:04:37.599> connection<00:04:38.050> between

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
basically Sables the connection between

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.540 
basically Sables the connection between
that<00:04:38.289> block<00:04:38.710> and<00:04:38.949> not<00:04:39.099> look<00:04:39.780> so<00:04:40.780> it<00:04:40.900> works<00:04:41.550> now

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
that block and not look so it works now

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.570 
that block and not look so it works now
doing<00:04:43.150> it<00:04:43.300> this<00:04:43.449> way<00:04:43.509> you<00:04:44.169> can't<00:04:44.500> please<00:04:44.860> walk

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
doing it this way you can't please walk

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.250 
doing it this way you can't please walk
staying<00:04:46.000> on<00:04:46.210> there<00:04:46.419> or<00:04:46.449> I'll<00:04:46.720> do<00:04:46.900> the<00:04:47.020> same

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
staying on there or I'll do the same

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.529 
staying on there or I'll do the same
it's<00:04:47.710> but<00:04:47.889> that's<00:04:48.070> one<00:04:48.250> bug<00:04:48.430> I'd<00:04:48.669> save<00:04:49.060> us<00:04:49.240> the

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
it's but that's one bug I'd save us the

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:52.260 
it's but that's one bug I'd save us the
connection<00:04:50.099> so<00:04:51.099> it's<00:04:51.340> got<00:04:51.550> to<00:04:51.669> be<00:04:51.789> one<00:04:51.970> block

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
connection so it's got to be one block

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.330 
connection so it's got to be one block
above<00:04:53.220> redstone<00:04:54.220> or<00:04:54.930> the<00:04:55.930> pen<00:04:56.169> in<00:04:56.860> the<00:04:57.039> Sun

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
above redstone or the pen in the Sun

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.129 
above redstone or the pen in the Sun
sensitive<00:04:57.909> two<00:04:58.030> blocks<00:04:58.330> one<00:04:58.630> block<00:04:58.870> that's

00:04:59.129 --> 00:04:59.139 
sensitive two blocks one block that's

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:05.339 
sensitive two blocks one block that's
one<00:04:59.409> that's<00:05:00.099> one<00:05:01.289> they<00:05:03.750> know<00:05:04.750> me<00:05:04.900> place<00:05:05.110> for

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:05.349 
one that's one they know me place for

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:08.520 
one that's one they know me place for
