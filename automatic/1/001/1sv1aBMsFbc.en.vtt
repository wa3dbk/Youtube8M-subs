00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.410
 We live in a crooked society where a daily message is on us 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.610
 are fired by more and more senders through more and more channels 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:09.530
 traditional 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.339
 and new media 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:16.740
 Many companies are therefore looking for the right way to communicate socially 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.050
 media is the magic word 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.669
 although in practice it appears to be very difficult to be distinctive 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:23.189
 to be 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.970
 because next to a halt the form must be right 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.349
 and he is an experience for modern consumers 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:32.160
 an animation offers a solution 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.260
 because it is not only suitable for different platforms 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.890
 the power of an animation it is precisely in connecting people that I do 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.350
 know elements of 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.309
 hear to see and experience to prove those powers we have made this video 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:46.680
 about an animation 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.380
 and then immediately on a difficult topic the mortgage interest deduction 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.400
 so you can see how cell complexes understandable material for a larger target group 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.610
 and nice day 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.570
 you will now see that an animation suits you 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.870
 in just three minutes and via a few steps 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.970
 the city brega the script 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.310
 the final quality of the animation is already at birth 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.070
 determined 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.720
 if the script is correct follow the form of self 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.070
 artur these are some basic rules 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.990
 as 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.380
 tell a story 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.380
 and because with an intro a plot and a lock 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.360
 but also ensure that an interview is handled 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.100
 because then the message sticks 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.340
 not to mention 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.460
 take the viewer into your story 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.450
 by very so the information 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.000
 you don't write a good script on a rainy Wednesday afternoon 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.980
 it is born from a passionate collaboration between customer and company 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.980
 this is how the story comes about 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.130
 step 2 the storyboard 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.170
 okay the story stands 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.720
 now follow at bielefeld 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.720
 band people think in images not in text 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.410
 so what happens when bild and texts are combined 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.440
 you get a message with even more effect 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.870
 a good scoreboard shows the most important moments of an animation 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.990
 that brings the story to a higher level with more impact 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.910
 with a sense of timing 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.809
 surprisingly from start to finish 

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:17.449
 step 3 the animation 

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:18.449
 script ready 

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:19.270
 check 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.459
 sorry sign off 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:21.279
 the church 

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:24.609
 then it is now time to bring the story to life 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:28.799
 story and world merge naturally during animation 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:33.589
 there comes atmosphere and emotion and ultimately the desired message is created 

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:36.019
 at nac 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.059
 In addition to movement, sound is also essential 

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:43.519
 with sound and one over as the voice that you now become becomes the viewer 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.249
 maximum stimulated hearing and seeing and reading 

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:49.099
 must first submit 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:52.099
 Only then will you get a real impact on your message 

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:53.980
 step 4 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.139
 distribution 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:56.959
 well the animation is ready 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.429
 time to harvest because we all do it for that 

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:02.870
 and with an animation you can actually sow 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.289
 to guide all this 

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:09.409
 in addition to your website that vent squeeze nturges shops shops promotions 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:13.170
 it was also on those other platforms where you want to be present with the right one 

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:14.879
 content 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:16.219
 the result 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:21.180
 this animation about a complicated subject yielded a thousand in four hours 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.129
 visitors on
