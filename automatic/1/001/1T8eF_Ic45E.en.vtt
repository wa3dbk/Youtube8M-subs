another<00:00:06.660> modern<00:00:06.930> warfare<00:00:07.200> 2<00:00:07.470> gameplay<00:00:07.500> but<00:00:08.460> I

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
another modern warfare 2 gameplay but I

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.190 
another modern warfare 2 gameplay but I
have<00:00:08.880> a<00:00:08.910> nuke<00:00:09.480> on<00:00:09.809> overgrown<00:00:10.679> with<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:11.179> f2000

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.200 
have a nuke on overgrown with the f2000

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.570 
have a nuke on overgrown with the f2000
nephew<00:00:13.200> thousand<00:00:13.530> is<00:00:13.650> probably<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.400> least

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
nephew thousand is probably the least

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.460 
nephew thousand is probably the least
use<00:00:15.000> gun<00:00:15.240> in<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.389> game<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.809> that's<00:00:16.230> for<00:00:16.440> a

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
use gun in the game and that's for a

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.470 
use gun in the game and that's for a
reason<00:00:16.529> because<00:00:17.220> it<00:00:17.640> doesn't<00:00:17.940> really<00:00:18.060> stack

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
reason because it doesn't really stack

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.220 
reason because it doesn't really stack
up<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.690> do<00:00:18.840> their<00:00:18.960> guns<00:00:19.580> I<00:00:20.660> can<00:00:21.660> see<00:00:21.750> usable<00:00:22.140> and

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
up to do their guns I can see usable and

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.870 
up to do their guns I can see usable and
stuff<00:00:22.470> but<00:00:22.769> compared<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.310> either<00:00:23.400> guns<00:00:23.699> it

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
stuff but compared to either guns it

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.700 
stuff but compared to either guns it
really<00:00:24.420> suffers<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.779> lot<00:00:24.930> in<00:00:25.019> terms<00:00:25.140> of<00:00:25.289> damage

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
really suffers a lot in terms of damage

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.290 
really suffers a lot in terms of damage
and<00:00:25.949> accuracy<00:00:27.230> just<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.730> really<00:00:29.730> sefirot<00:00:30.150> when

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
and accuracy just a really sefirot when

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.130 
and accuracy just a really sefirot when
you<00:00:30.390> use<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.599> because<00:00:30.900> you're<00:00:31.740> not<00:00:31.830> able<00:00:32.009> to

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
you use it because you're not able to

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.630 
you use it because you're not able to
kill<00:00:34.140> people<00:00:34.260> as<00:00:34.440> quickly<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:35.070> as<00:00:35.190> accurately

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
kill people as quickly and as accurately

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.580 
kill people as quickly and as accurately
as<00:00:35.940> when<00:00:36.660> using<00:00:36.899> like<00:00:37.050> pretty<00:00:37.230> much<00:00:37.290> any<00:00:37.500> other

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
as when using like pretty much any other

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.340 
as when using like pretty much any other
gun<00:00:37.829> in<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.010> game<00:00:38.840> but<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:39.899> decided<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.260> be

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
gun in the game but I decided to be

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.590 
gun in the game but I decided to be
pretty<00:00:40.739> fun<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.100> try<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.460> get<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.579> new<00:00:41.700> put<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:42.030> so

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
pretty fun to try to get a new put it so

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.479 
pretty fun to try to get a new put it so
let's<00:00:43.320> run<00:00:43.440> out<00:00:43.590> with<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.710> silencer<00:00:44.129> for<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.340> few

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
let's run out with a silencer for a few

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.180 
let's run out with a silencer for a few
games<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.360> wasn't<00:00:45.510> having<00:00:45.629> much<00:00:45.780> success

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
games and I wasn't having much success

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.040 
games and I wasn't having much success
I'll<00:00:47.190> forget<00:00:47.550> here<00:00:47.760> coming<00:00:48.570> out<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.690> this<00:00:48.809> bond

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
I'll forget here coming out of this bond

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.900 
I'll forget here coming out of this bond
with<00:00:49.289> one<00:00:49.320> man<00:00:49.590> army<00:00:49.770> Danger<00:00:50.129> Close<00:00:50.160> commanda

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
with one man army Danger Close commanda

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.630 
with one man army Danger Close commanda
obviously<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.539> pro<00:00:52.520> but<00:00:53.930> anyways<00:00:55.550> trying<00:00:56.550> it

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
obviously a pro but anyways trying it

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.479 
obviously a pro but anyways trying it
out<00:00:56.730> with<00:00:57.440> the<00:00:58.440> silencer<00:00:58.949> but<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.219> feel<00:00:59.399> the

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
out with the silencer but I feel the

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.580 
out with the silencer but I feel the
holographic<00:00:59.850> sights<00:01:00.350> works<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.469> lot<00:01:01.530> better

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
holographic sights works a lot better

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.770 
holographic sights works a lot better
with<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.850> just<00:01:03.059> being<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.239> team<00:01:03.390> player<00:01:03.420> cap

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
with it is just being a team player cap

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.649 
with it is just being a team player cap
of<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:03.930> flag<00:01:04.760> no<00:01:05.760> one<00:01:05.880> else<00:01:06.000> was<00:01:06.090> doing<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.420> and

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.539 

yeah<00:01:09.659> holographic<00:01:10.200> sights<00:01:10.470> since<00:01:11.040> well<00:01:11.460> the

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
yeah holographic sights since well the

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.580 
yeah holographic sights since well the
silencers<00:01:11.939> they<00:01:12.240> take<00:01:12.630> away<00:01:12.720> damage<00:01:13.110> over

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
silencers they take away damage over

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.230 
silencers they take away damage over
range<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.159> since<00:01:14.490> most<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.909> time<00:01:15.060> we<00:01:15.150> can

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
range and since most of the time we can

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.899 
range and since most of the time we can
try<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.390> be<00:01:15.590> killing<00:01:16.590> people<00:01:16.830> at<00:01:17.040> longer

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
try to be killing people at longer

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.480 
try to be killing people at longer
ranges<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.509> medium<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.290> long<00:01:19.409> range<00:01:19.439> are<00:01:20.280> the

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
ranges and medium to long range are the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.690 
ranges and medium to long range are the
silencer<00:01:20.850> decreases<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.780> damage<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.700> since

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
silencer decreases the damage and since

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.100 
silencer decreases the damage and since
you<00:01:23.759> have<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.909> burst<00:01:24.090> fire<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.750> takes<00:01:24.990> a

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
you have to burst fire it it takes a

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.020 
you have to burst fire it it takes a
while<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.470> kill<00:01:25.590> people<00:01:25.729> when<00:01:26.729> using<00:01:26.939> the

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
while to kill people when using the

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.330 
while to kill people when using the
silencer<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:28.890> think<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.220> first

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
silencer so this is I think the first

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.280 
silencer so this is I think the first
game<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.700> tried<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.240> tried<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.810> holographic

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
game I tried to I tried the holographic

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.609 
game I tried to I tried the holographic
set<00:01:31.530> out<00:01:31.650> on<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:33.290> now<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.320> can<00:01:34.590> see<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:35.329> well

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
set out on it and now I can see it well

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.770 
set out on it and now I can see it well
it<00:01:37.619> kills<00:01:37.799> them<00:01:37.920> o<00:01:38.280> Farrell<00:01:39.240> quicker<00:01:39.420> cuz<00:01:39.630> I'm

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
it kills them o Farrell quicker cuz I'm

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.969 
it kills them o Farrell quicker cuz I'm
like<00:01:39.900> one<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.380> two<00:01:40.530> balls<00:01:40.710> quicker

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
like one of the two balls quicker

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.840 
like one of the two balls quicker
without<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.460> sound<00:01:41.670> sir<00:01:41.909> but<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.420> does<00:01:43.850> seem

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
without the sound sir but it does seem

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.550 
without the sound sir but it does seem
to<00:01:45.000> kill<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.149> lot<00:01:45.329> quicker<00:01:45.540> he<00:01:46.140> notes<00:01:46.380> when<00:01:46.500> I

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
to kill a lot quicker he notes when I

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.440 
to kill a lot quicker he notes when I
wanted<00:01:46.829> two<00:01:46.950> bullets<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.460> does<00:01:48.090> help<00:01:48.299> out<00:01:48.420> a

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
wanted two bullets it does help out a

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.420 
wanted two bullets it does help out a
lot<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.930> up<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.470> get<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.649> lot<00:01:49.740> more<00:01:49.770> kills<00:01:50.100> and

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
lot and up to get a lot more kills and

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.090 
lot and up to get a lot more kills and
do<00:01:51.090> better<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:51.930> if<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.110> guys<00:01:52.200> having<00:01:52.979> some

down behind him

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.089 
down behind him
I can<00:02:09.190> so<00:02:09.520> I<00:02:09.550> my<00:02:09.670> Claymore<00:02:09.940> Adam<00:02:10.950> let<00:02:11.950> their

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
I can so I my Claymore Adam let their

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.130 
I can so I my Claymore Adam let their
right<00:02:12.220> that<00:02:12.310> site<00:02:12.550> because<00:02:13.540> it's<00:02:13.750> like<00:02:13.959> really

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
right that site because it's like really

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.140 
right that site because it's like really
dark<00:02:14.410> it's<00:02:14.650> why<00:02:14.800> I<00:02:14.830> don't<00:02:15.190> like<00:02:15.220> it<00:02:16.170> but<00:02:17.550> it<00:02:18.550> is

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
dark it's why I don't like it but it is

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.350 
dark it's why I don't like it but it is
the<00:02:19.360> only<00:02:19.390> thing<00:02:19.629> good<00:02:19.750> about<00:02:19.810> it<00:02:20.110> is<00:02:20.280> it's

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
the only thing good about it is it's

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.270 
the only thing good about it is it's
immune<00:02:22.360> to<00:02:22.510> EMPs<00:02:22.959> if<00:02:23.290> you<00:02:23.440> get<00:02:23.560> EMP<00:02:23.920> than<00:02:24.129> the

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
immune to EMPs if you get EMP than the

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.030 
immune to EMPs if you get EMP than the
red<00:02:24.550> that<00:02:24.640> still<00:02:24.910> works<00:02:25.090> fine<00:02:25.180> but<00:02:26.040> i

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
red that still works fine but i

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.650 
red that still works fine but i
recommend<00:02:27.310> now<00:02:27.610> using<00:02:27.970> that<00:02:28.030> to<00:02:28.180> get<00:02:28.269> your<00:02:28.420> 60

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
recommend now using that to get your 60

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.570 
recommend now using that to get your 60
kills<00:02:28.840> with<00:02:28.989> it<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.349> then<00:02:29.590> get<00:02:30.430> the

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
kills with it and then get the

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.570

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
which my first kill streak and just drop

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.070 
which my first kill streak and just drop
them<00:02:36.700> over<00:02:36.970> by<00:02:37.599> their<00:02:37.720> flag<00:02:39.090> um<00:02:40.090> using<00:02:40.959> the

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
them over by their flag um using the

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.949 
them over by their flag um using the
hairier<00:02:41.500> in<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:41.650> ac-130<00:02:42.160> uh<00:02:44.730> because<00:02:45.959> well

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
hairier in the ac-130 uh because well

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.240 
hairier in the ac-130 uh because well
ac-130<00:02:47.590> and<00:02:47.739> ground<00:02:47.890> more<00:02:48.040> you<00:02:48.160> could

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
ac-130 and ground more you could

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.319 
ac-130 and ground more you could
probably<00:02:48.400> you<00:02:48.640> can<00:02:48.730> get<00:02:48.849> a<00:02:48.880> lot<00:02:48.970> more<00:02:49.030> kills

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
probably you can get a lot more kills

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:50.729 
probably you can get a lot more kills
flicker<00:02:49.660> with<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.840> chopper<00:02:50.019> gunner<00:02:50.260> but<00:02:50.590> it's

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
flicker with the chopper gunner but it's

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.979 
flicker with the chopper gunner but it's
easier<00:02:50.950> to<00:02:51.040> shoot<00:02:51.190> down<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:52.480> people<00:02:52.780> only

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
easier to shoot down and people only

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
domination I also works and capture the

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.309 
domination I also works and capture the

flag if they're spawning on the side you

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.590 
flag if they're spawning on the side you
can<00:03:32.470> just<00:03:32.590> keep<00:03:32.680> killing<00:03:32.950> them<00:03:32.980> here<00:03:33.220> so<00:03:33.600> I'll

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
can just keep killing them here so I'll

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.050 
can just keep killing them here so I'll
get<00:03:34.720> a<00:03:34.750> nice<00:03:35.260> triple<00:03:35.650> kill<00:03:35.859> and<00:03:36.100> then<00:03:36.819> I<00:03:36.850> woke

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
get a nice triple kill and then I woke

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.030 
get a nice triple kill and then I woke
over<00:03:37.359> and<00:03:37.480> I<00:03:37.540> see<00:03:37.720> their<00:03:37.900> else<00:03:38.049> I<00:03:38.350> see<00:03:38.739> a<00:03:38.769> bunch
