00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.930

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.149

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.560

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.239
 people who learn to work 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:47.180

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.430
 want to have a hobby 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:54.300
 increasing interest which help 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.550
 makes this life better but for today we 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.520
 We have to sort out quite an ordinary song 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.760
 this children's song is really many 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.039
 of us work with children who have already 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.320
 your little children and the process still 

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:09.570
 quite small someone has brothers 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.220
 and sisters and so on so many 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.760
 of you come in handy this song is one of 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.220
 my favorite children's songs song 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.500
 good bug 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.560
 about the good hatch there are only four 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.810
 chord any of you even here contains 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.090
 guitar two weeks you can easily 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.380
 make out and look this song let's 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.770
 will proceed and 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:36.790
 work on a song in songs in slow 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:40.600
 Tempe looks like columns dance dance 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:45.130
 circle with dance circle stand in a circle 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.680
 lived in the world the good kind old good 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:52.500
 beetle 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:57.660
 he never shouted no grumble promised 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:00.660
 the edge of the wings splitting strictly zones 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.660
 prohibited 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:09.220
 so we have two parts two parts one 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:13.209
 part built on 2 chords is a technique 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.760
 please put the creator 2 on 1 4 on 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.170
 2 5 by 3 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.900
 take care of your fingers 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.640
 ran strings as it should, and on the other 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.940
 parties so that they do not touch 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.739
 which is below put in 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.060
 such is the position of the right hand when 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:33.360
 which thumb will be straight and 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.440
 the rest of the fingers being slightly bent 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.190
 right hand drawing we will have such 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:42.120
 groove and three fingers is indicative of this 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.120
 nameless views 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:53.720
 so chord c much 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:03:01.920
 the ball and the series in short now 6 on the third 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:02.990
 5 on 2 1 on 1 here we play 6 7 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.970
 and 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:10.810
 c again and now the same last 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.810
 repeat again 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.739
 ended the first part in the second part 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.769
 we need already neatly 7 2 country on 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:31.350
 first module 3 and first to second 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:40.610
 method 4 medana 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:40.610
 I played 73 years yet 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:50.910
 on dirk we press 5 to 2 sixth 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.750
 first and third 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:58.560
 then again until 7 and now we spend 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:04.680
 time ik-7 spend almost again 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:06.430
 back to the previous part but to 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.820
 to tell 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:15.200
 that maybe this song will be someone not 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:16.900
 very comfortable and you can sing in another 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:24.800
 tonality 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:26.629
 responsibility how to become all rupite 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.930
 all proud stand in a circle 

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:35.270
 lived in the world a good bug 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:36.259
 good old beetle is a light melody 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.310
 sounds below 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:46.030
 but it turns out that this is already showing 2 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:51.889
 me from all not yes here and now look 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:55.030
 Part 2 will be on the courts and 7 4 and 2 string 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.030
 in the second year 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:03.530
 gets never did he grumble shouted 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:09.280
 promised me 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:10.430
 the edge of the wings and cracked strictly quarrels 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.990
 forbade 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:18.949
 and again tones go to the first part and 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:21.620
 so we met the good bug song 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:24.830
 in two versions the first option we 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.840
 started playing a chord c and second 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.180
 option from chord g 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.300
 The first version sounds high enough 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.310
 and the person who will say so has 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.349
 average vocal ability you will 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.669
 complain to sing this song and here is the second 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:41.419
 option and then quart g 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:45.669
 it will be simple enough therefore 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:48.010
 choose your convenient options again 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:51.370
 lose 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:58.720

 on yourself yes well and the first option as here 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:29.870
