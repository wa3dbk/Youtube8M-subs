00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:12.270
 Hello guys 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:13.750
 In this class, let's talk about the score. 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:17.289
 huh 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:20.949
 the score she made for some musicians 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:24.820
 she is not 11 11 a seven- headed creature 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:27.699
 on note of score 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.449
 each one will get an opinion each one goes 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:35.530
 have an interpretation about a song 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:39.400
 but everyone will follow a skeleton is by 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:42.220
 that we like music is from 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.720
 way to beltrano touch him from sicrano to 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.590
 sometimes we do not like the version of 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:52.750
 so- and-so likes to be sicrano 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:54.490
 It's time to read a sheet music. 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.670
 various interpretations of a particular 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:01.330
 stretch that will vary feeling will be 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:04.809
 A minimum thing then in this class is 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:06.630
 Let's first explain about 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.300
 sheet music 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:14.800
 we will also have the agenda for 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:24.880
 studying the agenda is nothing more than five 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:27.040
 lines 345 while we have the agenda and 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.490
 in front of us does not mean 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.490
 absolutely nothing if you do not want to say it is 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.409
 it will be written something not 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.479
 This means that each line has a 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.080
 guitar has nothing to do with the 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.650
 other 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.920
 Let's continue our explanation here. 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:47.470
 So, to play the guitar, right? 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.290
 chave that we will use remembering 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.909
 that there are several keys but people 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.850
 go straight to the point not giving 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:58.690
 a lot of back there the key that we are going 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:02.680
 use is the key of sun 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:05.619
 It's okay, the key to the sun. It's got that name. 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:11.039
 without it because it is signed there in the 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:11.039
 second line of the right 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:18.810
 the second line from bottom to top 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:20.739
 You , she, she's not going for a walk. 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.340
 go up there 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:29.230
 the key of the sun from the moment that 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:31.780
 You drew the key and you made sense. 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.980
 the lines 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:38.409
 then since the sun clave is signed 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.109
 in the second line 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:43.870
 every time some appear pellet 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:46.769
 top of the second row 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.769
 Let's put a little ball 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:54.040
 we will always say that it is not this 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.409
 this is the sunshine note and we already know 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:04.859
 sequence ne 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:14.319
 following the notes given by me 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:17.709
 sun there you do re mi do sun ie is 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:22.540
 infinite do you re my sunshine there yes and behind 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:26.409
 ahead of me it's just the family around and 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:29.799
 see you back there only family around at last 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:31.689
 so let's go that line the second 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:34.239
 line even though I'm talking about where it went 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:36.849
 signed the door to this line now that 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:40.090
 be clear she will always represent 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:42.189
 note sun or whenever any 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:48.790
 top note of this line will be the note 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:51.959
 rising sun will have a space to put 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.959
 a ball in space 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:58.700
 the space above the sun line is the 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.740
 note 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:13.330
 there obeying the sequence is of the ref 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:18.680
 sun there the next line will be the 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:27.170
 following the sequence or sun there if the 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:41.860
 next space will be the next 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:41.860
 line the next space the next line 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:50.810
 we took the top part right now 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:54.350
 Let's get the part that's down. 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:05:00.950
 in the second line we have a sun that 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:05:03.710
 You already know below we have the sofa or 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:06.280
 either in the space below the ffa looks 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:10.460
 Sequel to you , you're welcome. 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:15.370
 here that has before fa in the line that 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.370
 we have below we have the me 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:22.100
 I'll explain later where it has more 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:24.110
 notes there but first it's just me 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:27.860
 I wanted to show you where you are. 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:32.390
 the notes are not how they appear to you 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:34.790
 know what a score is and why 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:39.110
 notes appear that way 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:41.600
 of course s is just the first example 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:44.390
 there will be many other things that 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.190
 It's going to happen there we'll learn it. 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:49.610
 step by step 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:54.590
 Okay, this was the first lesson to be able to 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:55.720
 show how the agenda is the key to the sun and 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.450
 the notes 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.940
 with the course of other classes we 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:03.220
 Let's explain by separating the 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:06.070
 measures the notes 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.760
 counts the harmonies and so on 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.940
 against 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:12.700
 haste is the enemy of perfection 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:15.880
 This video lesson is a video lesson to be 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:18.880
 didactic and not simply to stay 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:21.400
 plus one wrapping the videos of the 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.510
 youtube not ok 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.510
 to the next
