00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
doesn't dent the pole I mean you don't

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.980 
doesn't dent the pole I mean you don't
like<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.670> have<00:01:35.820> your<00:01:35.970> pole<00:01:36.150> all<00:01:36.360> dented<00:01:36.689> up<00:01:36.780> it

makes<00:01:37.140> everything<00:01:37.409> look<00:01:37.560> ugly<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.729> makes

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
makes everything look ugly and it makes

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.480 
makes everything look ugly and it makes
it<00:01:39.060> eventually<00:01:39.780> not<00:01:40.770> lock<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.280> place<00:01:41.460> that

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
it eventually not lock in the place that

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.450 
it eventually not lock in the place that
you<00:01:41.640> want<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.899> this<00:01:43.049> prevents<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:44.310> has
