again on the subject of dust this is my

bit<00:00:07.290> here<00:00:07.639> is<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.700> little<00:00:09.090> shop<00:00:09.269> vac<00:00:09.510> that<00:00:09.780> I

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
bit here is a little shop vac that I

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.240 
bit here is a little shop vac that I
bought<00:00:10.050> from<00:00:11.630> who<00:00:12.630> is<00:00:12.780> it<00:00:12.900> being<00:00:13.139> cute<00:00:13.469> ages

ago
the<00:00:15.120> only<00:00:15.240> problem<00:00:15.480> is<00:00:15.509> if<00:00:15.660> you<00:00:15.750> use<00:00:15.960> it<00:00:15.990> for

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
the only problem is if you use it for

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.080 
the only problem is if you use it for
more<00:00:16.379> than<00:00:16.529> 10<00:00:16.710> minutes<00:00:17.039> it<00:00:17.220> plugs<00:00:17.550> up<00:00:17.730> the

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
more than 10 minutes it plugs up the

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.080 
more than 10 minutes it plugs up the
back<00:00:18.300> just<00:00:18.660> gets<00:00:18.840> completely<00:00:20.090> clogged

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
back just gets completely clogged

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.929 
back just gets completely clogged
especially<00:00:21.779> with<00:00:21.869> fine<00:00:22.109> powders<00:00:22.699> so<00:00:23.699> what<00:00:23.910> I

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
especially with fine powders so what I

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.420 
especially with fine powders so what I
did<00:00:24.269> is<00:00:24.449> I<00:00:24.570> built<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.869> cyclone<00:00:25.560> system<00:00:26.010> it's

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
did is I built a cyclone system it's

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.800 
did is I built a cyclone system it's
incredibly<00:00:26.820> simple<00:00:27.560> it's<00:00:28.560> basically<00:00:29.660> this<00:00:30.660> is

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
incredibly simple it's basically this is

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.920 
incredibly simple it's basically this is
the<00:00:30.929> inlet<00:00:31.230> into<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.679> vacuum<00:00:31.859> cleaner

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
the inlet into the vacuum cleaner

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.270 
the inlet into the vacuum cleaner
there's<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:34.020> bit<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.440> know<00:00:34.559> this<00:00:34.860> standard

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
there's a bit of you know this standard

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.650 
there's a bit of you know this standard
plastic<00:00:36.079> piping<00:00:37.579> and<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.790> goes<00:00:38.910> down<00:00:39.149> into<00:00:39.390> an

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
plastic piping and it goes down into an

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.979 
plastic piping and it goes down into an
upturned<00:00:40.079> traffic<00:00:40.950> cone<00:00:41.540> so<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:42.690> tube

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
upturned traffic cone so this tube

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.220 
upturned traffic cone so this tube
extends<00:00:43.440> probably<00:00:44.309> about<00:00:44.460> this<00:00:44.640> far

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
extends probably about this far

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.389 
extends probably about this far
downwards<00:00:47.390> then<00:00:48.390> we<00:00:48.510> have<00:00:48.770> from<00:00:49.770> my<00:00:49.920> angle

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
downwards then we have from my angle

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.100 
downwards then we have from my angle
grinders<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.850> happens<00:00:51.260> coming<00:00:52.260> up<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.710> here<00:00:52.949> to

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
grinders it happens coming up to here to

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.950 
grinders it happens coming up to here to
the<00:00:55.110> side<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:56.010> traffic<00:00:56.550> curve<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.059> it's

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
the side of the traffic curve and it's

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.290 
the side of the traffic curve and it's
I've<00:00:58.230> tried<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.190> do<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.460> so<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.820> sort<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.090> sod

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
I've tried to do it so that sort of sod

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.439 
I've tried to do it so that sort of sod
tangent<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.020> it's<00:01:01.800> basically<00:01:02.219> just<00:01:02.449> roughly

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
tangent and it's basically just roughly

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.390 
tangent and it's basically just roughly
cut<00:01:03.750> held<00:01:04.049> at<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.290> screw<00:01:04.680> bit<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.040> silicon

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
cut held at a screw bit of silicon

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.410 
cut held at a screw bit of silicon
sealant<00:01:06.110> and<00:01:07.110> then<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.710> whole<00:01:07.860> thing<00:01:08.420> it's

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
sealant and then the whole thing it's

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.440 
sealant and then the whole thing it's
just<00:01:09.659> made<00:01:09.990> from<00:01:10.140> MDF<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.770> some<00:01:11.270> threaded<00:01:12.270> rod

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
just made from MDF and some threaded rod

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.880 
just made from MDF and some threaded rod
and<00:01:12.630> some<00:01:12.780> nuts<00:01:13.430> the<00:01:14.430> whole<00:01:14.640> thing<00:01:15.890> just

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
and some nuts the whole thing just

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.480 
and some nuts the whole thing just
poured<00:01:17.400> two<00:01:17.520> faces<00:01:20.390> base<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.570> looks<00:01:21.750> like<00:01:21.900> that

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
poured two faces base it looks like that

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.990 
poured two faces base it looks like that
and<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.580> sits<00:01:23.759> on<00:01:23.939> top<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.299> standard<00:01:24.720> bin

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
and it sits on top of a standard bin

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.910 
and it sits on top of a standard bin
that's<00:01:27.000> just<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.299> little<00:01:27.450> bit<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.720> this<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.680> two

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
that's just a little bit of this is two

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.230 
that's just a little bit of this is two
layers<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.299> MDF<00:01:30.299> one<00:01:31.049> smaller<00:01:31.470> than<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.680> other

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
layers of MDF one smaller than the other

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.630 
layers of MDF one smaller than the other
with<00:01:33.240> some<00:01:33.570> door<00:01:34.290> seal<00:01:34.850> type<00:01:35.850> sponge<00:01:37.490> and<00:01:38.490> it

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
with some door seal type sponge and it

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.490 
with some door seal type sponge and it
needs<00:01:39.090> some<00:01:39.420> weight<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:40.020> be<00:01:40.110> honest<00:01:40.350> at<00:01:40.439> the

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
needs some weight to be honest at the

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.319 
needs some weight to be honest at the
bottom<00:01:40.799> it's<00:01:40.920> quite<00:01:42.710> top-heavy<00:01:43.710> but<00:01:44.329> it

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
bottom it's quite top-heavy but it

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.569 
bottom it's quite top-heavy but it
really<00:01:45.720> works<00:01:46.229> incredibly<00:01:46.619> well<00:01:46.710> most<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.460> the

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
really works incredibly well most of the

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:48.620 
really works incredibly well most of the
stuff<00:01:47.610> ends<00:01:48.030> up<00:01:48.060> at<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.270> bottom<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.540> the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
stuff ends up at the bottom of the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.980 
stuff ends up at the bottom of the
bucket<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:50.030> it's<00:01:51.030> on<00:01:51.270> wheels<00:01:51.540> but<00:01:51.899> it

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
bucket and it's on wheels but it

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.050 
bucket and it's on wheels but it
as<00:01:53.560> I<00:01:53.680> said<00:01:53.860> it's<00:01:53.979> not<00:01:54.100> very<00:01:54.310> stable<00:01:54.549> it<00:01:54.850> needs

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
as I said it's not very stable it needs

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.999 
as I said it's not very stable it needs
basically<00:01:56.049> needs<00:01:56.290> a<00:01:56.350> couple<00:01:56.530> of<00:01:56.619> bricks<00:01:56.860> in

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
basically needs a couple of bricks in

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.530 
basically needs a couple of bricks in
the<00:01:57.070> bottom<00:01:57.250> of<00:01:57.340> it<00:01:57.399> all<00:01:57.579> types<00:02:00.090> but<00:02:01.090> it's<00:02:01.210> like

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
the bottom of it all types but it's like

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.530 
the bottom of it all types but it's like
hell<00:02:01.720> as<00:02:02.680> it<00:02:02.830> were<00:02:02.950> and<00:02:03.700> essentially<00:02:04.180> the<00:02:04.330> bag

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
hell as it were and essentially the bag

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.749 
hell as it were and essentially the bag
is<00:02:05.350> collecting<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:05.860> very<00:02:06.009> fine<00:02:06.250> stuff<00:02:06.549> and<00:02:06.700> is

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
is collecting the very fine stuff and is

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.660 
is collecting the very fine stuff and is
acting<00:02:07.090> as<00:02:07.180> a<00:02:07.210> filter<00:02:07.420> now<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:09.310> it's<00:02:09.489> just

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
acting as a filter now and it's just

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.140 
acting as a filter now and it's just
it's<00:02:10.060> run<00:02:10.709> all<00:02:11.709> evening<00:02:12.069> grinding<00:02:12.819> the<00:02:12.910> floor

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
it's run all evening grinding the floor

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.449 
it's run all evening grinding the floor
so<00:02:14.400> I'm<00:02:15.400> quite<00:02:15.580> happy<00:02:15.640> with<00:02:15.970> it<00:02:16.120> really<00:02:17.459> and

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
so I'm quite happy with it really and

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.569 
so I'm quite happy with it really and
I'm<00:02:18.580> at<00:02:18.700> breath<00:02:18.970> for<00:02:19.150> some<00:02:19.269> reason
