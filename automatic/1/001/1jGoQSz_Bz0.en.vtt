00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:07.290
 Hello everyone with you on this is the same 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.120
 it's time to before the release of the iphone 6 is just 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.880
 a cloud of time and you already know how he 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.889
 will be 99 percent already can be said 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.900
 what will be the new iphone 6 and yet 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.880
 one percent stays on what's possible 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.010
 it will not do what we are now 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.630
 see on 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.630
 photo opportunity and will make the iphone 6 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.480
 something else but you know guys like that 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.400
 iphone 6 will be here i think that even here 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.590
 and argue nothing more and more 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.239
 people say that typhoon 6 and all 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.120
 fewer and fewer people say it's not 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.100
 iphone 6 in the end everything will be as always 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.020
 people are now farting on these layouts and then 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.660
 When they buy, they will use the week to say 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.969
 Well, you know, I used it and very 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.469
 cake what is it all about and the ipod 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.780
 touch of the fifth generation in which 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.280
 banged with a hammer he broke into different 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.140
 parties i.e. say iphone 6 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.610
 will look like ipod touch fifth 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.770
 generations that is it will be the same 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.690
 design is the only thing you want to 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.789
 the camera did not protrude from the body was 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.890
 recessed into the hull as we now see on 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.199
 fives 5 and 5s 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.000
 you know pluto that we want the usual 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.680
 quite worried she shows us what we 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.350
 flights that we will use in 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.180
 Generally it is as always to this man 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.490
 on used however you know looking at 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.619
 This picture on this photo I see 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.960
 this iphone 6 i definitely want to 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.540
 and here he has something that attracts 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.890
 this is of course a 47 inch screen 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.890
 or 5 5 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.509
 as they say, but it's more than 4 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.070
 of course he says that suits me 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:34.380
 4 inches on iphone 5s but however 47 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.939
 It looks very tempting to move 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.860
 the result for this short video can 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.840
 say iphone 6 from ipod touch 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.000
 fifth generation just a little bit more 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.000
 we will not talk about the characteristics yet 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.500
 we will return to them a little later when 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.630
 there will be more accurate information 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.430
