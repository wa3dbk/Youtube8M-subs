00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
do is we use a machine here this is

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.910 
do is we use a machine here this is
called<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:06.030> break<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:07.200> we<00:01:07.350> got<00:01:07.530> one<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.740> these

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
called a break so we got one of these

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.760 
called a break so we got one of these
set<00:01:08.220> up<00:01:08.340> on<00:01:09.000> our<00:01:09.180> truck<00:01:10.549> just<00:01:12.409> you<00:01:13.409> know<00:01:13.500> put

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
let's say if we were doing this is our

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.080 
let's say if we were doing this is our
unfinished<00:02:05.540> just<00:02:06.410> project<00:02:06.710> that<00:02:07.160> we<00:02:07.370> you<00:02:08.060> know

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
unfinished just project that we you know

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
stuff that we had for example now you

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.170 
stuff that we had for example now you
could<00:02:14.990> use<00:02:15.020> this<00:02:15.320> trim<00:02:15.710> you<00:02:16.670> could<00:02:16.850> use<00:02:17.030> this

always paint this and actually I

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.250 
always paint this and actually I

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
recommend if you if you have a wood

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.159 
recommend if you if you have a wood
sided<00:04:27.770> house

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.189 

I<00:04:31.330> recommend<00:04:32.330> painting<00:04:32.720> and<00:04:32.810> I<00:04:32.840> think<00:04:33.080> it

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 
I recommend painting and I think it

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:35.110 
I recommend painting and I think it
looks<00:04:33.380> actually<00:04:33.590> nicer<00:04:34.370> because<00:04:34.669> with<00:04:34.970> the

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
looks actually nicer because with the

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.390 
looks actually nicer because with the
wood<00:04:35.330> the<00:04:35.630> painted<00:04:36.020> wood<00:04:36.199> trim<00:04:36.560> and<00:04:37.100> you<00:04:37.250> can

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
wood the painted wood trim and you can

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.430 
wood the painted wood trim and you can
just<00:04:37.580> paint<00:04:37.760> all<00:04:38.030> this<00:04:38.270> and<00:04:38.630> fill<00:04:39.139> in<00:04:39.320> the

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
just paint all this and fill in the

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.379 
just paint all this and fill in the
holes<00:04:39.470> and<00:04:40.010> then<00:04:40.310> paint<00:04:40.580> in<00:04:40.729> I<00:04:40.849> think<00:04:41.090> it<00:04:41.180> looks

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 
holes and then paint in I think it looks

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.350 
holes and then paint in I think it looks
better<00:04:41.630> if<00:04:42.070> you<00:04:43.070> have<00:04:43.250> aluminum<00:04:43.820> siding<00:04:44.120> or

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
better if you have aluminum siding or

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.150 
better if you have aluminum siding or

vinyl siding that I definitely recommend

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.040 
vinyl siding that I definitely recommend
having<00:04:46.520> a<00:04:46.789> cap<00:04:47.060> because<00:04:47.330> it<00:04:47.539> would<00:04:47.660> look<00:04:47.810> funny

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
having a cap because it would look funny

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.950 
having a cap because it would look funny
having<00:04:48.880> aluminum<00:04:49.880> or<00:04:50.000> vinyl<00:04:50.030> siding<00:04:50.780> and<00:04:50.900> then

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
having this wood showing and then with a
