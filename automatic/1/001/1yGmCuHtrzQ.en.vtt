and two full wallets and you know they

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.160 
and two full wallets and you know they
served<00:00:26.820> obviously<00:00:27.600> two<00:00:27.750> different<00:00:28.020> purposes

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
served obviously two different purposes

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.869 
served obviously two different purposes
but<00:00:28.650> this<00:00:28.860> wallet<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.460> really<00:00:29.820> neat<00:00:30.030> uh

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:31.879 
but this wallet is really neat uh

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:34.639 
but this wallet is really neat uh
probably<00:00:32.879> just<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.300> reglazed<00:00:33.780> but<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.289> don't

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
probably just the reglazed but I don't

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.619 
probably just the reglazed but I don't
really<00:00:34.800> bother<00:00:35.670> because<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.269> is<00:00:36.420> what<00:00:36.600> I

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:36.629 
really bother because this is what I

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:40.090 
really bother because this is what I
consider<00:00:36.719> my<00:00:37.379> kickball<00:00:38.070> wallet<00:00:38.609> which

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
consider my kickball wallet which

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.860 
consider my kickball wallet which
anything<00:00:41.100> can<00:00:41.249> happen<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.870> probably

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
anything can happen and probably

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.569 
anything can happen and probably
wouldn't<00:00:43.109> care<00:00:43.260> but<00:00:43.589> I<00:00:43.800> won't<00:00:44.100> get<00:00:44.370> rid<00:00:44.519> of
