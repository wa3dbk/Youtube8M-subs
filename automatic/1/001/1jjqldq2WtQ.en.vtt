00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.959
 quinoa we have it's yes but it's 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.650
 handy for those who are 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.650
 allergic to alleys 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.660
 the family 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:24.210
 ban ki moon that's the plant come from 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.820
 waves as soon as you join us 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.770
 here in Anjou it's a bank that in 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.240
 the spinach family and beetroot 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.930
 made you little ones become 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.630
 white that we boiling and we 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.740
 eat like couscous 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.530
 but 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.690
 it does not get out of breath in different ways 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:48.770
 we removed on the fly as yvonne 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.870
 gilli also do it at poker in 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:54.800
 Bolivians here at home 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:57.560
 mainly we do it online all 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.080
 as was returning to the stage of 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.570
 very superficial way between 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.100
 one or two centimeters deep and 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.870
 roll up behind to make a good 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:11.390
 contact with one of the complainants and 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.020
 mom rooting and then to make 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.150
 this plant 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.010
 he can do a lot a lot a lot 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.550
 small roots that go very very 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.830
 far but deep roots and plants 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.540
 there is not much in the field 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.950
 that's why they are so 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.950
 sensitive to the quality of the terrain 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.830
 do what they conceal - terreÃ¯s 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.500
 markham spring cereals have 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.150
 positioned note for example - but because 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.850
 that flowering is destiny that is 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.670
 very sensitive or too wet 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.000
 but look not he's waiting for that radius of 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.610
 Sun 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.010
 and then if it's too hot too we have 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.170
 matured on initiation and that plus and sean 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.180
 does one work so we see one was so 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.470
 fully most likely to have 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.950
 a good harvest in good 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.760
 terms 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.760
 salt month of august 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.540
 he 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.300
 if the origin tennessee in the united states 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.200
 I need a French from there and 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.750
 then we 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.660
 saleh in France and then we went 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.640
 installed 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.849
 we also ask 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:32.790
 yes it's my news we have 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:36.660
 started eating a lot of Chinese 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.230
 as alongside our cities and leon 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.110
 brussels 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.599
 we started eating by replacing the 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.879
 bluff in starchy foods like apple 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:47.459
 of land he laughed and a pretty run 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.080
 to be not s and nutritious for 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.730
 the management of the involvement 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.920
 nutritionists advised us 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.299
 the stranger he will have and we have found 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.860
 it's so good we wanted in russia 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.660
 but it's sure it's not him plant 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.730
 a mosquito is there and our experience 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.120
 because continue when it's too much 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.640
 hot 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.410
 the plant pushes you ie 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.630
 Greek universities are seeds 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.890
 he has a lot of trouble to the other and he 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.129
 do not like humility 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.250
 it makes him run pretty fast too 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:16.379
 auxerre 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.810
 you need a place that is rather cool 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:23.430
 and dry then I would be pretty good 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:26.220
 candidates for that extracts how in 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.260
 the area he pays more his novel he does 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.660
 better quality more protein 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.459
 gold is it was more he can find 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.870
 of the copy area if there is one thing 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.900
 we really call since those 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:40.950
 years it's the one to two the zone the 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.549
 naso area see if a plant that is 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.709
 well late 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:47.980
 he was just at the end of flowering on 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:54.730
 still sees a few sometimes 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:58.760
 here we see the college they pretend 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.440
 80 consents there is a vein for 20 20 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.480
 points are flowers that are going to get 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.660
 to cross with their neighbors especially through 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.100
 the lift bridge I do not really have the 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.530
 bankers frequented a lot by 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.850
 bees but we still have a little 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:15.070
 little insect is in the field it has to 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:21.109
 help a little bit too a poison 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:23.240
 that this is the wild version 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.930
 Chinese so that's the niche little bit of 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.820
 White 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.550
 it is this plant the domestic and to 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.720
 through centuries and centuries in 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.900
 south america 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.460
 instead of just tearing them apart 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.680
 two options and hot water to that 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.150
 we did in europe where they have 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.780
 selected so that the seeds are 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:44.030
 more and more mass in order to be able to the 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.870
 cooking and eating we can learn 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:52.000
 the seeds ranging from black orange brown 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.000
 long violet games 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.370
 you 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.470
 we would like people to eat 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.540
 more than 2 kg 1 I think it's 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.080
 really something that is to who has 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.009
 of the future 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:11.610
 I would like and not after the 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:11.610
 quillan to you 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.000
 good week
