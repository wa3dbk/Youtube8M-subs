00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
it's all it takes to cause water damage

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.590

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150

have<00:01:18.750> been<00:01:18.900> feeding<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.409> orchid<00:01:19.830> fertilizer

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
have been feeding it orchid fertilizer

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.740 
have been feeding it orchid fertilizer
actually<00:01:20.850> which<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.180> quite<00:01:21.509> rich<00:01:21.720> in

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
actually which is quite rich in

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.010 
actually which is quite rich in
phosphorus<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.799> potassium<00:01:23.299> so<00:01:24.299> all<00:01:24.509> I<00:01:24.540> do<00:01:24.720> is

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
phosphorus and potassium so all I do is

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.840 
phosphorus and potassium so all I do is
I<00:01:25.049> take<00:01:25.320> out<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.710> inner<00:01:26.040> pot<00:01:26.340> from<00:01:27.060> there<00:01:28.850> and

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
I take out the inner pot from there and

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:37.340 
I take out the inner pot from there and
I<00:01:30.680> just<00:01:31.680> pour<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.700> water<00:01:35.869> so<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:36.900> feed<00:01:37.200> it

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
I just pour the water so you feed it

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.749 
I just pour the water so you feed it
from<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.650> bottom<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.159> can<00:01:38.220> see<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.460> water

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
from the bottom you can see the water

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.249 
from the bottom you can see the water
there<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.439> then<00:01:40.439> all<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.740> do<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.400> just<00:01:41.460> place

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
there and then all I do is just place

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.460 
there and then all I do is just place
the<00:01:43.259> pot<00:01:43.530> back<00:01:43.829> in<00:01:44.040> there<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.460> that's<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.470> so

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
the pot back in there and that's it so

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.960 
the pot back in there and that's it so
there's<00:01:46.770> no<00:01:47.180> water<00:01:48.180> damage<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.439> lead<00:01:49.970> so

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
there's no water damage to the lead so

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.870 
there's no water damage to the lead so
and<00:01:51.840> that's<00:01:52.380> all<00:01:52.619> I've<00:01:52.770> been<00:01:52.799> doing<00:01:52.979> say<00:01:53.610> for

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
and that's all I've been doing say for

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.420 
and that's all I've been doing say for
the<00:01:53.970> last<00:01:54.180> two<00:01:54.570> months<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.290> I've<00:01:56.009> got<00:01:56.250> this

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
the last two months and I've got this

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.730 
the last two months and I've got this
huge<00:01:57.229> profusion<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.530> flowers<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.689> buds<00:02:00.740> so

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
huge profusion of flowers and buds so

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.789 
huge profusion of flowers and buds so
it's<00:02:02.640> been<00:02:02.820> really<00:02:03.000> quite<00:02:03.329> exciting<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.200> just

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
it's been really quite exciting to just

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.580 
it's been really quite exciting to just
have<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.009> single<00:02:05.310> plant<00:02:05.790> now<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:07.200> make<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.409> even

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
have a single plant now to make it even

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.150 
have a single plant now to make it even
prettier<00:02:08.009> I<00:02:08.580> could<00:02:09.360> do<00:02:10.020> do<00:02:10.500> away<00:02:10.800> with<00:02:10.830> these

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
prettier I could do do away with these

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.730 
prettier I could do do away with these
drag<00:02:11.550> Lea<00:02:11.730> leaves<00:02:12.000> as<00:02:12.720> I<00:02:12.870> take<00:02:13.140> them<00:02:13.349> away

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
drag Lea leaves as I take them away

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.980 
drag Lea leaves as I take them away
I'm<00:02:14.310> sure<00:02:14.550> there<00:02:14.790> will<00:02:14.880> be<00:02:14.940> more<00:02:15.210> baby<00:02:15.510> plants

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
I'm sure there will be more baby plants

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.100 
I'm sure there will be more baby plants
like<00:02:16.920> at<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.670> base<00:02:17.880> of<00:02:18.240> where<00:02:18.660> you<00:02:18.780> cut<00:02:18.960> off<00:02:19.080> a

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
like at the base of where you cut off a

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.140 
like at the base of where you cut off a
leaf<00:02:19.410> there<00:02:19.770> will<00:02:19.860> be<00:02:19.890> plant<00:02:20.280> and<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:20.670> pot

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
leaf there will be plant and the pot

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.570 
leaf there will be plant and the pot
will<00:02:21.360> get<00:02:21.540> more<00:02:21.780> crowded<00:02:22.190> so<00:02:23.190> you<00:02:23.250> could

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
will get more crowded so you could

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.900 
will get more crowded so you could
actually<00:02:23.880> cut<00:02:24.360> it<00:02:24.480> off<00:02:24.600> here<00:02:25.080> rather<00:02:25.980> than<00:02:26.310> at

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
actually cut it off here rather than at

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.150 
actually cut it off here rather than at
the<00:02:26.970> base<00:02:27.330> of<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.630> plant<00:02:27.870> and<00:02:28.140> then<00:02:28.890> you<00:02:29.010> could

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
the base of the plant and then you could

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
the base of the plant and then you could
just<00:02:29.190> have<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:29.670> one<00:02:29.850> plant<00:02:30.440> with<00:02:31.440> this<00:02:31.590> nice

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
just have the one plant with this nice

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.500 
just have the one plant with this nice
bloom<00:02:33.180> of<00:02:33.390> flowers<00:02:33.570> and<00:02:35.120> you<00:02:36.120> know<00:02:36.240> it<00:02:36.330> looks

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
bloom of flowers and you know it looks

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.860 
bloom of flowers and you know it looks
kind<00:02:36.720> of<00:02:36.810> pretty<00:02:37.020> too<00:02:37.380> and<00:02:37.650> if<00:02:38.490> you<00:02:38.550> can<00:02:38.670> avoid

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
kind of pretty too and if you can avoid

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.290 
kind of pretty too and if you can avoid
stains<00:02:39.870> like<00:02:40.170> that<00:02:40.460> that<00:02:41.460> would<00:02:41.610> make<00:02:41.790> it<00:02:41.940> even

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
stains like that that would make it even

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.780 
stains like that that would make it even
nicer<00:02:42.860> all<00:02:43.860> right<00:02:44.330> thanks<00:02:45.330> for<00:02:45.360> watching
