00:00:03.132 --> 00:00:05.707
 Hello everyone, I am Kevin, welcome everyone to watch Tech a Look. 

00:00:05.707 --> 00:00:08.804
 Today, Kevin wants to introduce to you by NZXT. 

00:00:08.804 --> 00:00:11.025
 Mid-range computer case H230 

00:00:11.025 --> 00:00:15.136
 We are very happy to invite AZ to NZXT to introduce us. 

00:00:15.136 --> 00:00:16.718
 This case 

00:00:16.718 --> 00:00:20.765
 Please let the audience friends on the spot help us shoot our hands. 

00:00:26.626 --> 00:00:30.120
 Yes, we know that NZXT has launched a chassis like the Mirage series. 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.296
 Very enthusiastic discussion among players 

00:00:32.296 --> 00:00:33.880
 There is also a very good reputation喔

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.293
 And this is the H series H230 

00:00:36.293 --> 00:00:38.017
 We ask Ah Zhong to tell us about it. 

00:00:38.017 --> 00:00:40.966
 What is the characteristic of this case? 

00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:46.806
 Then the part of our H230 basically continues the concept of our previously launched H2. 

00:00:46.806 --> 00:00:50.556
 Then make it a bit smaller and make everyone more affordable. 

00:00:51.663 --> 00:00:56.266
 The front design is basically a very simple style. 

00:00:56.266 --> 00:01:00.431
 But in the simplest, we also added a chrome trim strip in front. 

00:01:00.431 --> 00:01:03.425
 With a small black corner, here 

00:01:03.425 --> 00:01:07.041
 Let it have a little personality 

00:01:07.416 --> 00:01:09.927
 So I saw the expansion of I/O on it. 

00:01:09.927 --> 00:01:14.208
 The expansion slot for I/O is designed with 2 USB3.0 on it. 

00:01:14.208 --> 00:01:18.352
 With all the basic power supplies, everything is designed on top. 

00:01:18.492 --> 00:01:23.614
 Ok, let’s talk about its special opening. 

00:01:23.614 --> 00:01:26.999
 This is a one-piece front cover 

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:32.056
 In the middle, there are three expansion slots of 5.25. 

00:01:32.056 --> 00:01:36.886
 Also below is a place where you can have a fan in the wind. 

00:01:36.886 --> 00:01:39.927
 Because it is a silent chassis, so there is a door design. 

00:01:39.927 --> 00:01:42.880
 Can make it sound less noisy, right? 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.331
 After it is covered 

00:01:45.331 --> 00:01:49.299
 This side and the bottom also have a design for the wind. 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.052
 Can help with heat dissipation 

00:01:52.052 --> 00:01:56.307
 Ok, let’s take a look at the design of the back of this case. 

00:01:56.307 --> 00:01:58.464
 Overall, this case is very degenerate. 

00:01:58.464 --> 00:02:00.858
 Then very simple and generous 

00:02:00.858 --> 00:02:05.720
 On the back part, there is also a 12 cm fan at the top. 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.974
 This is a medium-sized mid-tower design 

00:02:07.974 --> 00:02:11.641
 So it is an expansion slot with 7 PCIe 

00:02:11.641 --> 00:02:14.309
 7 good, do you want to count it? 

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:17.469
 1234567 is correct for 7 

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:20.844
 At the bottom is one of our power supplies 

00:02:20.844 --> 00:02:23.637
 We will do a design for this kind of power supply. 

00:02:23.637 --> 00:02:26.303
 There is also a filter design under the power supply. 

00:02:26.303 --> 00:02:32.724
 Can help that is when the wind is sucking 

00:02:32.724 --> 00:02:35.868
 I have seen two water-cooled holes on the back. 

00:02:35.868 --> 00:02:39.469
 For this is it can let you if you have to do external water cooling 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:41.418
 You can have the possibility of expansion 

00:02:41.418 --> 00:02:46.133
 Ok, this H230 is very special about its design in terms of mute. 

00:02:46.133 --> 00:02:47.724
 Then let's open the cover and let everyone see it. 

00:02:47.724 --> 00:02:51.532
 Internal settings inside it 

00:02:52.637 --> 00:02:54.029
 Ok, let's open its side cover now. 

00:02:54.029 --> 00:03:00.277
 I saw a lot of mute cotton on both sides of the design. 

00:03:00.277 --> 00:03:03.110
 Now we are seeing the inside of this H230. 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.359
 Let's introduce 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:09.033
 All three of the 5.25 in the internal part have a tool-free design. 

00:03:09.033 --> 00:03:11.195
 So just pull it in as simple as this 

00:03:11.195 --> 00:03:16.065
 Sliding your CD player or fan controller, etc. from the front 

00:03:16.065 --> 00:03:17.365
 So no screws are needed 

00:03:17.365 --> 00:03:18.168
 No screws required 

00:03:18.168 --> 00:03:22.271
 Then you can buckle it back. 

00:03:22.271 --> 00:03:22.866
 Locked up 

00:03:22.866 --> 00:03:24.611
 Fixed it 

00:03:24.611 --> 00:03:29.334
 We can install 6 hard drives in the hard drive 

00:03:29.334 --> 00:03:32.977
 This hard drive in the middle is extractable. 

00:03:32.977 --> 00:03:35.808
 It has a screw lock on the other side. 

00:03:35.808 --> 00:03:37.039
 So usually won’t move 

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:38.979
 So you can lengthen your graphics card 

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:43.094
 Can add a video card or your fan will be better in this romantic 

00:03:43.094 --> 00:03:45.983
 Then let's talk about its motherboard support. 

00:03:45.983 --> 00:03:49.094
 The motherboard is the ATX motherboard. 

00:03:49.094 --> 00:03:55.204
 Or Micro-ATX or Mini-ITX 

00:03:55.204 --> 00:03:59.507
 Now let's take a look at the other side 

00:03:59.507 --> 00:04:04.385
 Ok, we see that there is also a design for making this sound-absorbing cotton. 

00:04:04.385 --> 00:04:09.977
 This is ours we just mentioned 6 hard disk slots 

00:04:09.977 --> 00:04:13.140
 All the hard drives come out from this side 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.389
 The part of the wiring is on this side. 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:18.928
 So our design is to let you remove the hard drive 

00:04:18.928 --> 00:04:22.790
 Just remove the side panel and you can do it. 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.220
 There are two screws on this side that are fixed to the hard disk frame above. 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:33.675
 It is a more solid design when you keep this part. 

00:04:33.675 --> 00:04:37.227
 Then let's take a hard drive to demonstrate it now. 

00:04:37.227 --> 00:04:39.780
 It has a hard drive that can be installed without screws. 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:45.779
 Your storage device is very convenient 

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:49.976
 The front is a fan that can hold two 12 (cm) 

00:04:49.976 --> 00:04:52.810
 The original factory is attached to one inside. 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:58.316
 Also attached to our accessory box here 

00:05:00.501 --> 00:05:04.372
 There is also a degree of space on the back because it is a medium-sized case. 

00:05:04.372 --> 00:05:07.108
 So although the whole line space is still not so big, 

00:05:07.108 --> 00:05:11.053
 But it also allows you to walk all the way to the back. 

00:05:11.053 --> 00:05:15.732
 This will make your case interior space better. 

00:05:24.326 --> 00:05:26.033
 Yeah, okay, this is our introduction today. 

00:05:26.033 --> 00:05:28.134
 We are very happy to invite AZ in NZXT today. 

00:05:28.134 --> 00:05:31.197
 Let us introduce this H230 

00:05:31.197 --> 00:05:36.331
 Then let's ask the audience at the scene to clap us for us, okay? 

00:05:36.331 --> 00:05:39.828

00:05:39.828 --> 00:05:43.131
