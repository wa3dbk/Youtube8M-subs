00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 Hello dear friends yourself android 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.180
 user today as promised hope in 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.519
 I will tell you a short video about how 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.849
 working hours on android 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:15.000
 this is an alji watch from meizu mx4 smartphone 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:24.359
 on flyme 40 firmware if you are ready 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:26.760
 i start well why did i want 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.859
 record this video well most likely you 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.660
 already guessed as functional 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.989
 which providing this firmware 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.329
 more precisely the functional that becomes 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.239
 possible for meizu smartphone owners 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.969
 along with the clock on 2f it is completely not 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.770
 full is putting it mildly 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.570
 most likely it depends on the version 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.670
 I will remind the firmware of my phone 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.300
 Chinese and for me is available only 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.370
 international firmware with index a in 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.789
 This firmware is missing google play 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.379
 market initial all google services and 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:02.420
 they need to be installed separately like me 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:05.100
 I know on the firmware with the index oh on the end 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.760
 there is initially all play services 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.680
 of the market and how I work there hours 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.470
 Unfortunately I can not suffer today I 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.600
 I will talk about how the clock works on 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.900
 namely android firmware index 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.939
 at the end and in order for you to me 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.450
 believe i will show you my version 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.450
 firmware 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:30.930
 4222 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:33.990
 flyme index and here's the first thing right away 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.590
 striking is that in the panel 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.170
 notifications instead of the clock icon here 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.390
 we have a presence icon with the letter g but 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.570
 it's okay, but the next one 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.390
 a parameter that I really do not 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.159
 I was pleased that it was not possible 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.619
 voice control using google 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:58.860
 teams and all because 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:02:00.750
 voice search services for meizu mx4 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.130
 refuses to work 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.450
 this will demonstrate the application 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.959
 google application has encountered an error 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.550
 Therefore, we can not find anything for you 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.800
 By the way, before connecting the clock 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.319
 everything worked perfectly on the phone polish 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.310
 I stopped working on z google search 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.959
 I deleted all Google services 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.750
 reinstalled again and some 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:28.430
 time everything worked for me but then u 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:31.190
 I get out here again this error 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.959
 you can't look for anything at all 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:41.519
 the same thing happens on the clock 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:45.060
 for example ok google what time is the first 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.640
 my team decided exactly further 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.730
 ok google 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:57.890
 the height of the elves in the tower all watches no longer 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:03:04.769
 looking let's try ok google again 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:06.840
 how much time does the clock find nothing but in 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.610
 the phone pops up again and the same 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.920
 google application error 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:14.190
 an error occurred i therefore we are nothing 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:18.000
 can not find next would like 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.950
 talk a little about the dials now 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.739
 I have both third-party and 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.659
 stock dials but the fact is that a 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.909
 third-party dials are enough 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:28.260
 problematic to put for example if you 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:34.379
 downloaded applications 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:35.490
 Well, as I have for the night space or 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:37.170
 that and for 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.480
 and choose for example by stripping 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:43.290
 the application got the dial went 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.240
 Back in android in the program, click 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.820
 settings sync app and 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:53.040
 sort of like dials should immediately 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:55.770
 will appear on our watch but unfortunately in 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.130
 During the first day when I downloaded these 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:01.230
 applications and synced with 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.540
 the application of firewood in no dials 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.610
 I have not found new ones and only for the following ones 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.980
 I have a new day here 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:11.640
 dials are just the same with the weather 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:14.510
 they do not need them here now, in principle, it is 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.680
 not a serious problem but a bit of it 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.230
 disappointing next problem 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.650
 which I noticed that the clock is enough 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:25.050
 seriously starting to slow down and don't know in 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.270
 What is it all it's probably too 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.730
 due to the fact that google services are not 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:33.360
 works very well for example 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:36.920
 same voice assistant who with my 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:39.300
 asus tablet works very fast 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:42.060
 In this case, podlagivaet 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.130
 as you might have noticed u again the first 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.020
 time when i say kangaroo post like 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:50.270
 block the phone it works but 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:53.540
 ok ok google for the second time ok google 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.540
 how much time 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:05.470
 nothing works sorry otherwise 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:09.010
 In principle, all the settings everything works with 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:12.370
 meizu mx4 all applications are downloaded 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:15.610
 very well the browser works the same 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:19.110
 what else would like to show others 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:22.900
 applications that I downloaded the same 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:25.210
 calculator everything works fine yet 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.889
 I would like to note that because of that 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.530
 you have voice commands unavailable 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:31.750
 you cannot activate 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:34.290
 for example, voice put a timer 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:37.440
 set the alarm to write a letter 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:40.570
 means to call someone and so on 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.669
 well that's all i said in 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:45.400
 Mostly other functions work 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:47.380
 have losing voice controls 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.539
 voice control with google 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:52.530
 the whole point of the clock on android is lost 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:55.030
 so if you have a meizu phone on 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.990
 chinese firmware i'm not extremely 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.530
 I advise you to buy 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:01.600
 data clock any clock on / b because 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:04.030
 they will not function fully well 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.740
 I hope the video was useful for you. 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.229
 put your thumbs up subscribe to 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:11.400
 My channel was with you android user to 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:11.400
 new meetings yet
