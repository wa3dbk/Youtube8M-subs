00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
okay let me just zoom out here okay so

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.460 
okay let me just zoom out here okay so
this<00:00:05.040> is<00:00:05.279> I<00:00:05.310> guess<00:00:05.759> first<00:00:06.029> try<00:00:06.390> with<00:00:06.810> actually

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
this is I guess first try with actually

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.959 
this is I guess first try with actually
gas<00:00:07.649> in<00:00:07.919> the<00:00:08.010> tank<00:00:08.280> and<00:00:09.019> handle<00:00:10.490> yeah<00:00:11.490> and

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
gas in the tank and handle yeah and

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.940 
gas in the tank and handle yeah and
don't<00:00:12.360> worry<00:00:12.509> about<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.960> warning<00:00:13.170> i<00:00:13.410> fold<00:00:13.710> but

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
don't worry about the warning i fold but

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.650 
don't worry about the warning i fold but
just<00:00:14.190> not<00:00:14.309> hooked<00:00:14.549> up<00:00:14.670> yet<00:00:14.730> we'll<00:00:15.240> start<00:00:15.570> it

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
just not hooked up yet we'll start it

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
just not hooked up yet we'll start it
without<00:00:15.719> here<00:00:16.320> we<00:00:16.470> go<00:00:23.779> try<00:00:24.779> again<00:00:27.740> again<00:00:35.180> huh

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.619 

let's<00:00:43.680> check<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.340> coil<00:00:44.879> sounds<00:00:45.270> like<00:00:45.420> it's

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
let's check the coil sounds like it's

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.580 
let's check the coil sounds like it's
not<00:00:45.870> fine<00:00:46.170> right<00:00:46.410> order<00:00:47.809> ok<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:49.079> time<00:00:49.350> we're

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
not fine right order ok this time we're

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.369 
not fine right order ok this time we're
gonna<00:00:49.739> try<00:00:50.430> we're<00:00:51.420> gonna<00:00:51.629> start<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:52.020> again<00:00:52.079> and

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
gonna try we're gonna start it again and

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.139 
gonna try we're gonna start it again and
this<00:00:52.500> time<00:00:52.559> we're<00:00:52.890> going<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.190> try<00:00:53.430> with<00:00:53.789> the

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
this time we're going to try with the

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.450 
this time we're going to try with the
plug<00:00:54.539> wires<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.260> actually<00:00:55.680> correct<00:00:55.980> firing

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
plug wires and actually correct firing

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.160 
plug wires and actually correct firing
order<00:00:56.760> so<00:00:56.940> hopefully<00:00:57.780> they'll<00:00:57.960> make<00:00:58.140> a

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
order so hopefully they'll make a

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:06.859 
order so hopefully they'll make a
difference<00:00:58.640> ok<00:00:59.640> here<00:00:59.820> we<00:00:59.850> go<00:01:05.420> ok<00:01:06.420> let's<00:01:06.659> try

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
difference ok here we go ok let's try

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:19.490 
difference ok here we go ok let's try
again

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.240

I turned it off is not running on all

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.460 
I turned it off is not running on all
cylinders<00:01:24.440> huh<00:01:26.420> why's<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.690> has<00:01:27.840> exhaust<00:01:28.229> on

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
cylinders huh why's it has exhaust on

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:37.550 
cylinders huh why's it has exhaust on
right<00:01:28.790> why<00:01:29.790> is<00:01:29.850> this<00:01:30.030> allowed<00:01:31.220> know<00:01:36.500> what<00:01:37.500> do

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.220 
so they saw some air now but they're
made<00:02:14.959> it<00:02:15.049> we're<00:02:15.170> plugging<00:02:15.519> the<00:02:16.519> fans<00:02:17.200> now<00:02:18.200> I

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
made it we're plugging the fans now I

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.190 
made it we're plugging the fans now I
started<00:02:18.739> to<00:02:18.829> get<00:02:18.950> one

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.400 

checking<00:02:22.200> out<00:02:22.320> setups

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:03:54.470 

in<00:02:27.740> a<00:02:27.920> tree

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.920

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:28.620 

what

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.700 

292<00:04:29.530> 70<00:04:30.280> to<00:04:30.430> 90<00:04:30.670> at<00:04:30.910> the<00:04:31.030> crank<00:04:31.330> so<00:04:32.260> let's<00:04:32.530> get

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
292 70 to 90 at the crank so let's get

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.460 
292 70 to 90 at the crank so let's get
into<00:04:32.770> our<00:04:33.040> 250<00:04:33.730> at<00:04:33.820> the<00:04:33.850> wheels

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.230 

240<00:04:37.220> at<00:04:37.310> the<00:04:37.370> wheel

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:05:33.279 

let's<00:04:41.840> see

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:33.289 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:07:22.159 

Oh
