00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.490 

right<00:00:11.790> here<00:00:11.940> this<00:00:12.090> is<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.240> mothership<00:00:12.929> analog

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
right here this is the mothership analog

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.950 
right here this is the mothership analog
synthesizer<00:00:14.009> so<00:00:14.700> it<00:00:14.820> uses<00:00:15.000> any<00:00:15.299> monophonic

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
synthesizer so it uses any monophonic

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.859 
synthesizer so it uses any monophonic
signal<00:00:17.090> including<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.150> know<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.270> guitar<00:00:18.600> would

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
signal including you know a guitar would

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.019 
signal including you know a guitar would
you<00:00:19.109> know<00:00:19.230> person<00:00:19.770> for<00:00:19.920> instance<00:00:19.980> what<00:00:20.939> I'm

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
you know person for instance what I'm

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.179 
you know person for instance what I'm
going<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.180> use<00:00:21.240> so<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:21.960> has<00:00:22.109> four<00:00:22.350> basic<00:00:22.769> voices

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
going to use so it has four basic voices

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.480 
going to use so it has four basic voices
it<00:00:23.310> has<00:00:23.519> no<00:00:24.150> has<00:00:25.140> your<00:00:25.170> VCO<00:00:25.590> which<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.369> know

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
it has no has your VCO which is you know

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.040 
it has no has your VCO which is you know
your<00:00:26.670> oscillator<00:00:27.060> square<00:00:27.420> triangle<00:00:27.900> wave

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
your oscillator square triangle wave

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.939 
your oscillator square triangle wave
clean<00:00:28.710> signal<00:00:28.949> sub<00:00:29.820> octave<00:00:30.240> or<00:00:30.390> ring<00:00:30.720> mod<00:00:30.869> Hey

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
clean signal sub octave or ring mod Hey

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.160 
clean signal sub octave or ring mod Hey
so<00:00:32.460> now<00:00:32.669> I'm<00:00:32.820> just<00:00:32.940> demonstrating<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.660> square

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
so now I'm just demonstrating the square

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.470 
so now I'm just demonstrating the square
wave<00:00:34.350> in<00:00:35.040> unison<00:00:35.489> with<00:00:35.670> my<00:00:35.790> screen<00:00:36.210> guitar

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
wave in unison with my screen guitar

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.580 
wave in unison with my screen guitar
signal

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.760 

you're<00:00:43.460> tryin<00:00:43.700> away<00:00:43.910> for<00:00:44.090> a<00:00:44.120> little<00:00:44.270> it<00:00:44.330> softer

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:01:02.799 

and<00:00:48.770> I<00:00:48.920> can<00:00:49.070> turn<00:00:49.160> on<00:00:49.250> the<00:00:49.310> glide<00:00:49.610> control<00:01:01.809> and

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
and I can turn on the glide control and

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:04.930 
and I can turn on the glide control and
then<00:01:02.960> I<00:01:03.050> can<00:01:03.230> add<00:01:03.320> the<00:01:03.470> sub<00:01:03.949> octave<00:01:04.280> which<00:01:04.460> is

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
then I can add the sub octave which is

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:23.380 
then I can add the sub octave which is
an<00:01:05.210> octave<00:01:05.660> down<00:01:05.869> from<00:01:06.080> the<00:01:06.140> incoming<00:01:06.440> pitch

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.370 

then<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.479> have<00:01:24.570> your<00:01:24.689> ring<00:01:24.840> mod<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.200> it's<00:01:25.320> an

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
then you have your ring mod and it's an

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.080 
then you have your ring mod and it's an
intelligent<00:01:25.920> man<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.159> he<00:01:26.250> uses<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.640> pitch<00:01:26.850> to

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
intelligent man so he uses the pitch to

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.820 
intelligent man so he uses the pitch to
create<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.420> carrier<00:01:27.720> signal<00:01:28.110> so<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.500> creates

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
create the carrier signal so it creates

00:01:28.830 --> 00:02:43.900 
create the carrier signal so it creates
a<00:01:28.890> constant<00:01:29.280> interval

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.270 

that's<00:02:44.910> about<00:02:45.090> that
