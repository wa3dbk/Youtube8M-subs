00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:16.860 
I'll be providing a full review on the

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.769 
I'll be providing a full review on the
kono<00:00:16.890> vaque<00:00:17.460> 2<00:00:17.520> slider<00:00:18.000> which<00:00:18.570> some

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
kono vaque 2 slider which some

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.570 
kono vaque 2 slider which some
considered<00:00:19.200> to<00:00:19.320> be<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.560> ultimate<00:00:19.590> in<00:00:20.160> slider

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
considered to be the ultimate in slider

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.760 
considered to be the ultimate in slider
equipment<00:00:21.150> but<00:00:21.720> before<00:00:22.020> I<00:00:22.050> get<00:00:22.230> started<00:00:22.439> I

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:22.770 
equipment but before I get started I

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.350 
equipment but before I get started I
want<00:00:22.950> to<00:00:23.010> discuss<00:00:23.340> some<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.610> the<00:00:23.670> issues<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.210> ran

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.360 
want to discuss some of the issues I ran

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.120 
want to discuss some of the issues I ran
up<00:00:24.480> against<00:00:24.810> when<00:00:25.080> researching<00:00:25.619> this<00:00:25.740> product

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
up against when researching this product

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.580 
up against when researching this product
for<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.730> first<00:00:26.940> time<00:00:27.240> before<00:00:28.110> I<00:00:28.350> bought<00:00:28.560> the

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
for the first time before I bought the

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.680 
for the first time before I bought the
slider<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:29.250> was<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.430> slattern<00:00:29.850> hoon<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.240> didn't

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:30.690 
slider I was a slattern hoon I didn't

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.210 
slider I was a slattern hoon I didn't
know<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.020> different<00:00:31.320> types<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.590> sliders<00:00:31.860> and

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.220 
know the different types of sliders and

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.790 
know the different types of sliders and
what<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:32.850> needed<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.420> get<00:00:33.540> started<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.650> had

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
what I needed to get started and I had

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.500 
what I needed to get started and I had
to<00:00:34.920> watch<00:00:35.100> several<00:00:35.580> different<00:00:35.879> videos<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.210> get

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
to watch several different videos to get

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.660 
to watch several different videos to get
all<00:00:36.690> my<00:00:36.780> questions<00:00:36.960> answered<00:00:37.350> in<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:38.370> video

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
all my questions answered in this video

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.070 
all my questions answered in this video
I'll<00:00:38.940> try<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.269> answer<00:00:39.420> all<00:00:39.540> those<00:00:39.900> same

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.080 
I'll try to answer all those same

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.620 
I'll try to answer all those same
questions<00:00:40.290> within<00:00:41.100> one<00:00:41.280> video<00:00:41.640> well<00:00:42.300> let's

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:42.630 
questions within one video well let's

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.569 
questions within one video well let's
get<00:00:42.809> started<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.710> first<00:00:43.950> question<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.340> asked

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
get started the first question I asked

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.639 
get started the first question I asked
myself<00:00:44.730> was<00:00:45.030> what<00:00:45.930> are<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.170> different<00:00:46.530> types

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
myself was what are the different types

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.709 
myself was what are the different types
of<00:00:46.860> sliders<00:00:47.130> the<00:00:47.969> first<00:00:48.239> type<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.660> the

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
of sliders the first type is the

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.600 
of sliders the first type is the
friction<00:00:49.260> slider<00:00:49.530> which<00:00:49.980> uses<00:00:50.340> plastic

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
friction slider which uses plastic

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.180 
friction slider which uses plastic
bearings<00:00:51.239> those<00:00:51.960> are<00:00:52.140> self<00:00:52.410> lubricated<00:00:53.040> and

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
bearings those are self lubricated and

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.580 
bearings those are self lubricated and
have<00:00:53.430> no<00:00:53.700> moving<00:00:54.000> parts<00:00:54.079> these<00:00:55.079> are<00:00:55.140> typically

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
have no moving parts these are typically

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.190 
have no moving parts these are typically
less<00:00:55.860> expensive<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.790> a<00:00:57.210> bit<00:00:57.450> harder<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:58.050> get

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
less expensive and a bit harder to get

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.010 
less expensive and a bit harder to get
that<00:00:58.320> smooth<00:00:58.739> panty<00:00:59.520> shot<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.360> second<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:00.960> a

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
that smooth panty shot the second is a

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.170 
that smooth panty shot the second is a
roller<00:01:01.440> bearing<00:01:01.860> type<00:01:02.129> which<00:01:02.730> does<00:01:02.969> have

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
roller bearing type which does have

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.150 
roller bearing type which does have
moving<00:01:03.539> parts<00:01:03.570> but<00:01:04.289> it's<00:01:04.440> a<00:01:04.500> lot<00:01:04.710> smoother

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
moving parts but it's a lot smoother

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.710 
moving parts but it's a lot smoother
however<00:01:05.789> the<00:01:06.030> system<00:01:06.180> will<00:01:06.539> require

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
however the system will require

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.109 
however the system will require
maintenance<00:01:07.410> from<00:01:07.560> time<00:01:07.800> to<00:01:07.950> time<00:01:07.979> now<00:01:08.970> it's

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
maintenance from time to time now it's

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.490 
maintenance from time to time now it's
pretty<00:01:09.330> obvious<00:01:09.750> why<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:09.960> went<00:01:10.200> with<00:01:10.320> the

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
pretty obvious why I went with the

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.200 
pretty obvious why I went with the
roller<00:01:10.680> bearing<00:01:11.100> instead<00:01:11.550> of<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.729> plastic

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
roller bearing instead of the plastic

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.940 
roller bearing instead of the plastic
bearing<00:01:12.509> and<00:01:12.750> that's<00:01:13.140> because<00:01:13.410> I<00:01:13.440> wanted<00:01:13.860> that

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
bearing and that's because I wanted that

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.680 
bearing and that's because I wanted that
smooth<00:01:14.340> motion<00:01:14.819> without<00:01:15.240> much<00:01:15.479> effort

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
smooth motion without much effort

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.660 
smooth motion without much effort
although<00:01:16.319> I<00:01:16.530> do<00:01:16.649> have<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.039> mention<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.429> the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
although I do have to mention that the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.699 
although I do have to mention that the
roller<00:01:17.910> bearing<00:01:18.330> sliders<00:01:18.750> are<00:01:18.959> typically<00:01:19.350> two

00:01:19.699 --> 00:01:19.709 
roller bearing sliders are typically two

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:21.830 
roller bearing sliders are typically two
to<00:01:19.890> three<00:01:20.100> times<00:01:20.310> more<00:01:20.850> expensive<00:01:20.910> than<00:01:21.720> the

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
to three times more expensive than the

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.870 
to three times more expensive than the
plastic<00:01:22.289> bearing<00:01:22.530> types<00:01:22.770> another<00:01:23.550> question

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
plastic bearing types another question

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.460 
plastic bearing types another question
that<00:01:23.910> I<00:01:24.030> had<00:01:24.240> before<00:01:24.569> purchasing<00:01:24.959> the<00:01:25.110> konova

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
that I had before purchasing the konova

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.130 
that I had before purchasing the konova
k2<00:01:25.700> was<00:01:26.700> does<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.030> require<00:01:27.360> significant

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
k2 was does it require significant

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.260 
k2 was does it require significant
sliding<00:01:28.530> experience<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.550> give<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.880> smooth

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
sliding experience to give that smooth

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.690 
sliding experience to give that smooth
motion<00:01:30.750> because<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.170> had<00:01:31.560> no<00:01:31.920> experience<00:01:32.099> and

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
motion because I had no experience and

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.880 
motion because I had no experience and
the<00:01:33.390> simple<00:01:33.720> response<00:01:34.080> to<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.319> question<00:01:34.530> is

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
the simple response to this question is

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.669 
the simple response to this question is
no<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.610> requires<00:01:36.030> no<00:01:36.390> effort<00:01:36.569> and<00:01:36.990> no<00:01:37.170> practice

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:37.679 
no it requires no effort and no practice

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:39.169 
no it requires no effort and no practice
to<00:01:37.800> get<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.069> near-perfect<00:01:38.520> shot

00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:39.179 
to get that near-perfect shot

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:40.910 
to get that near-perfect shot
literally<00:01:39.750> from<00:01:39.959> the<00:01:40.050> moment<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.590> bought<00:01:40.800> the

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
literally from the moment I bought the

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.859 
literally from the moment I bought the
slider<00:01:41.190> all<00:01:41.490> my<00:01:41.640> shots<00:01:41.880> were<00:01:42.060> nearly<00:01:42.420> perfect

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
slider all my shots were nearly perfect

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.230 
slider all my shots were nearly perfect
of<00:01:43.080> course<00:01:43.349> with<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.649> little<00:01:43.800> practice<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:45.090> can

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
of course with a little practice you can

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.120 
of course with a little practice you can
get<00:01:45.390> even<00:01:45.509> better<00:01:45.720> shots<00:01:46.140> but<00:01:46.740> at<00:01:46.830> the<00:01:46.950> end<00:01:46.979> of

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
get even better shots but at the end of

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.620 
get even better shots but at the end of
the<00:01:47.190> day<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.429> wanted<00:01:47.819> a<00:01:47.910> slider<00:01:48.209> that<00:01:48.450> worked

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
the day I wanted a slider that worked

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.480 
the day I wanted a slider that worked
for<00:01:48.750> me<00:01:48.899> every<00:01:49.200> time<00:01:49.440> and<00:01:49.860> not<00:01:49.979> have<00:01:50.160> to<00:01:50.310> worry

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
for me every time and not have to worry

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.580 
for me every time and not have to worry
about<00:01:50.640> how<00:01:50.940> to<00:01:50.970> keep<00:01:51.209> it<00:01:51.390> stable<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.050> it's

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
about how to keep it stable and it's

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.169 
about how to keep it stable and it's
just<00:01:52.830> one<00:01:52.979> less<00:01:53.190> thing<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.459> think<00:01:53.789> about<00:01:53.880> when

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
just one less thing to think about when

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:55.850 
just one less thing to think about when
I'm<00:01:54.330> shooting<00:01:54.539> another<00:01:55.080> question<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.649> had

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
I'm shooting another question that I had

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.880 
I'm shooting another question that I had
before<00:01:56.190> purchasing<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.729> konova<00:01:57.090> k2<00:01:57.200> was<00:01:58.200> does

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
before purchasing the konova k2 was does

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.770 
before purchasing the konova k2 was does
it<00:01:59.069> come<00:01:59.310> with<00:01:59.340> everything<00:01:59.849> I<00:01:59.940> need<00:02:00.179> to<00:02:00.450> get

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:03.209 
sliding out of the box when I finally

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:06.169 
sliding out of the box when I finally
decided<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.959> purchase<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.349> konova<00:02:04.770> k2<00:02:04.800> I<00:02:05.459> wasn't

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:06.179 
decided to purchase a konova k2 I wasn't

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:07.880 
decided to purchase a konova k2 I wasn't
entirely<00:02:06.509> sure<00:02:06.720> if<00:02:07.050> I<00:02:07.170> would<00:02:07.229> need<00:02:07.470> an<00:02:07.619> extra

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
entirely sure if I would need an extra

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.620 
entirely sure if I would need an extra
adapter<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.429> connect<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.789> my<00:02:08.910> camera<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.509> I

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
adapter to connect to my camera and I

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.390 
adapter to connect to my camera and I
actually<00:02:09.780> did<00:02:10.200> need<00:02:10.410> an<00:02:10.500> extra<00:02:10.770> adapter<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.340> I

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
actually did need an extra adapter and I

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.130 
actually did need an extra adapter and I
didn't<00:02:11.610> know<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:11.880> at<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.120> time<00:02:12.330> so<00:02:12.690> I<00:02:12.720> had<00:02:13.110> a

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
didn't know that at the time so I had a

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.740 
didn't know that at the time so I had a
slider<00:02:13.500> that<00:02:13.739> I<00:02:13.800> could<00:02:14.069> not<00:02:14.310> use<00:02:14.849> you<00:02:15.510> could

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
slider that I could not use you could

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.990 
slider that I could not use you could
not<00:02:15.989> add<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:17.010> slider<00:02:17.250> directly<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:17.909> the

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
not add the slider directly to the

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.229 
not add the slider directly to the
camera<00:02:18.360> and<00:02:18.510> because<00:02:19.230> of<00:02:19.590> this<00:02:19.739> I<00:02:20.040> decided<00:02:21.000> to

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
camera and because of this I decided to

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.720 
camera and because of this I decided to
buy<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.450> Manfrotto<00:02:22.219> 128

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
buy the Manfrotto 128

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.399 
buy the Manfrotto 128
but<00:02:24.420> you<00:02:24.510> can<00:02:24.629> definitely<00:02:24.750> get<00:02:25.170> something

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
but you can definitely get something

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:27.470 
but you can definitely get something
fairly<00:02:25.739> inexpensive<00:02:26.519> to<00:02:26.700> get<00:02:26.849> you<00:02:26.970> going<00:02:27.150> and

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
fairly inexpensive to get you going and

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.330 
fairly inexpensive to get you going and
since<00:02:27.780> I<00:02:27.900> mentioned<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.319> Manfrotto<00:02:28.799> this

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
since I mentioned the Manfrotto this

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.280 
since I mentioned the Manfrotto this
fluid<00:02:29.730> head<00:02:29.879> adapter<00:02:30.360> is<00:02:30.480> incredible<00:02:31.049> it

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
fluid head adapter is incredible it

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.649 
fluid head adapter is incredible it
provides<00:02:31.680> absolutely<00:02:32.549> smooth<00:02:32.970> panning<00:02:33.330> in

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
provides absolutely smooth panning in

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.360 
provides absolutely smooth panning in
its<00:02:33.840> build<00:02:34.080> like<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.319> boss<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:35.040> it's<00:02:35.159> fairly

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
its build like a boss and it's fairly

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.280 
its build like a boss and it's fairly
easy<00:02:35.489> to<00:02:35.730> move<00:02:35.909> around<00:02:36.180> between<00:02:36.420> tripods<00:02:37.049> and

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
easy to move around between tripods and

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.619 
easy to move around between tripods and
sliders<00:02:37.920> but<00:02:38.730> again<00:02:39.030> you<00:02:39.239> don't<00:02:39.330> need<00:02:39.510> to

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
sliders but again you don't need to

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.630 
sliders but again you don't need to
spend<00:02:39.930> money<00:02:40.140> on<00:02:40.440> a<00:02:40.560> Manfrotto<00:02:41.190> you<00:02:41.489> can

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
spend money on a Manfrotto you can

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.949 
spend money on a Manfrotto you can
definitely<00:02:41.760> get<00:02:42.150> something<00:02:42.390> less<00:02:42.780> expensive

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
definitely get something less expensive

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.530 
definitely get something less expensive
and<00:02:43.650> get<00:02:44.099> similar<00:02:44.370> shots<00:02:44.819> and<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.360> last

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
and get similar shots and the last

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.240 
and get similar shots and the last
question<00:02:45.870> that<00:02:45.900> I<00:02:46.019> had<00:02:46.260> before<00:02:46.560> purchasing

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
question that I had before purchasing

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.229 
question that I had before purchasing
the<00:02:47.940> konova<00:02:48.330> k2<00:02:48.360> was<00:02:49.049> Kenny<00:02:50.040> Cinco<00:02:50.459> tripod<00:02:50.970> an

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
the konova k2 was Kenny Cinco tripod an

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.110 
the konova k2 was Kenny Cinco tripod an
inexpensive<00:02:52.170> tripod<00:02:52.950> hold<00:02:53.549> up<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.849> slider

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
inexpensive tripod hold up the slider

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.569 
inexpensive tripod hold up the slider
solo<00:02:54.480> this<00:02:55.440> is<00:02:55.590> actually<00:02:55.950> a<00:02:55.980> really<00:02:56.160> important

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
solo this is actually a really important

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.819 
solo this is actually a really important
question<00:02:56.849> at<00:02:57.180> least<00:02:57.329> for<00:02:57.540> me<00:02:57.660> I<00:02:57.870> only<00:02:58.620> had<00:02:58.799> one

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
question at least for me I only had one

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:00.559 
question at least for me I only had one
tripod<00:02:59.340> at<00:02:59.430> the<00:02:59.549> time<00:02:59.760> so<00:03:00.000> I<00:03:00.030> needed<00:03:00.209> to<00:03:00.420> know

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
tripod at the time so I needed to know

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.050 
tripod at the time so I needed to know
if<00:03:00.810> one<00:03:01.049> tripod<00:03:01.530> can<00:03:01.709> hold<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.040> slider<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:02.609> a

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
if one tripod can hold the slider and a

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.839 
if one tripod can hold the slider and a
canon<00:03:03.450> t3i<00:03:03.690> I<00:03:04.319> had<00:03:04.709> to<00:03:04.920> run<00:03:05.069> this<00:03:05.190> myself<00:03:05.790> the

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
canon t3i I had to run this myself the

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:06.440 
canon t3i I had to run this myself the
hard<00:03:06.120> way

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
hard way

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.479 
hard way
unfortunately<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.349> konova<00:03:07.680> k2<00:03:07.709> was<00:03:08.160> simply

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
unfortunately the konova k2 was simply

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.400 
unfortunately the konova k2 was simply
too<00:03:08.790> heavy<00:03:09.060> for<00:03:09.180> one<00:03:09.390> tripod<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:10.049> hold<00:03:10.230> it

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
too heavy for one tripod to hold it

they<00:03:25.739> will<00:03:25.890> provide<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.459> stability<00:03:27.000> and
