 presentation that will be entirely 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.090
 integrated into the article because we want you 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.800
 talk about a ready-made machine that 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.559
 comes from an e-commerce know 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.050
 materiel.net and so we tested this day 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.870
 and so we present you today the 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.699
 machine hyperion a machine clearly 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.129
 for gamers with components 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.769
 clearly chosen upscale we have a 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.469
 hexacore processor a geforce titan 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:50.579
 for example short really what to play 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.140
 in good conditions 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.109
 we stay on a price that is still 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.249
 relatively high of 1799 euros basic 

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:58.170
 we offer you immediately 

00:00:56.249 --> 00:01:00.949
 discover the machine itself and the 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.929
 editing proposed by materiel.net 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:07.140
 let's start the tour of this machine with 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:09.750
 firstly the materiel.net housing has 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.219
 trusts corsair with 1,652 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.530
 rather a very good shops had been 

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:15.810
 well noted by the farm we have a window 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.740
 to discover the inside of the case 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.899
 easy opening you see we find a 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.700
 large fan on the 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:25.530
 top that will extract everything 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.890
 the hot air that there is inside the 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.840
 housing 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.250
 materiel.net also offers us a 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.799
 dvd burner 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.109
 we immediately go inside 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.170
 to discover the hardware choices of the 

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:39.719
 e-trader here we are now at 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.820
 inside this pc gamer hyperion everything 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:44.429
 first a word about the montage it is 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.189
 relatively clean the cables uses 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:49.890
 well the different passages proposed by 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.350
 the case is connected with necklaces 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.509
 in places it is rather very well 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.219
 done at that level at the level of the 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:01.890
 hardware configuration we go first 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:06.060
 find a motherboard asus p9 x79 pro 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:09.950
 to host the intel core processor 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.130
 i7 39 30 case a model so we can 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.340
 overclocked to cool 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:19.840
 the cpu we find a Corsican a corsair 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:23.590
 hydro series h80 and so we can 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:26.740
 monitor with the dedicated software we have 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:30.280
 also 4 x 4 gigabytes of memory 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:34.180
 comes from g.skill timings 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:37.660
 in cl9 and speed in 1866 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:41.910
 megahertz for display on your bel 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:44.830
 screen you will have a geforce gtx titans 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.410
 inside so giga of memory she 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.520
 comes from gainward to feed 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.910
 all in energy 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.820
 we find a power corsair hx 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:58.060
 650 watts that offers certification 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:00.430
 80plus gold and cables entirely 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.130
 modular then we have as we said 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.010
 a dvd burner a storage system 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.910
 by hard drive classic in 2 tera 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:14.800
 bytes that comes from seagate with 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:19.450
 a barracuda 7200 points 14 and finally we 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:23.080
 here has a ssd that comes this time from 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:26.950
 at samsung and that is 1 840 pro series 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.780
 256 giga short there is enough to do the 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.670
 editing is well done but we will 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.560
 finish this presentation video by 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.270
 the back of the case because it's a 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.600
 essential element to see if the 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.990
 editing is properly done while 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.640
 like the other side we notice that 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.590
 materiel.net to exploit the 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.570
 passages to pass different 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.090
 cables and to connect all the cables 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:51.520
 together via mounting collars which 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.260
 so is very clean for this hyperion 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.820
 we offer you of course on the pages 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.890
