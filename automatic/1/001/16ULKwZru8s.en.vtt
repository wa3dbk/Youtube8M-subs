00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
just makes me wonder how many other

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.310 
just makes me wonder how many other
bowlers<00:01:19.369> are<00:01:19.610> out<00:01:19.790> there<00:01:20.060> that<00:01:20.390> think<00:01:21.170> it's

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
bowlers are out there that think it's

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.660 
bowlers are out there that think it's
them<00:01:21.530> and<00:01:21.560> that's<00:01:22.040> why<00:01:22.190> they're<00:01:22.340> not<00:01:22.460> going

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
them and that's why they're not going

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.100 
them and that's why they're not going
better<00:01:23.060> they're<00:01:23.300> having<00:01:23.540> a<00:01:23.600> mental<00:01:23.960> exercise

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
better they're having a mental exercise

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.780 
better they're having a mental exercise
that<00:01:24.560> I<00:01:24.619> really<00:01:24.920> just<00:01:25.070> put<00:01:25.310> down<00:01:25.430> the<00:01:25.580> fact

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
that I really just put down the fact

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.100 
that I really just put down the fact
their<00:01:25.909> ball<00:01:26.060> doesn't<00:01:26.300> fit<00:01:26.540> their<00:01:26.659> hand<00:01:26.900> at<00:01:27.020> all

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
their ball doesn't fit their hand at all

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.469 
their ball doesn't fit their hand at all
very<00:01:27.950> aware<00:01:28.310> that<00:01:28.369> there's<00:01:28.820> so<00:01:29.000> many<00:01:29.090> bowlers

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
very aware that there's so many bowlers

very aware that there's so many bowlers
out<00:01:30.850> hopefully<00:01:31.850> we<00:01:34.930> original<00:01:35.930> resource<00:01:36.680> that

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
out hopefully we original resource that

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.499 
out hopefully we original resource that
their<00:01:37.039> ability<00:01:37.520> to<00:01:37.550> keep<00:01:37.759> their<00:01:37.820> swings<00:01:38.210> is<00:01:38.360> in

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
their ability to keep their swings is in

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:44.420 
their ability to keep their swings is in
all<00:01:38.690> fit<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:41.030> proof<00:01:41.300> is<00:01:41.420> in<00:01:41.479> the<00:01:41.600> swing

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:55.670 

the<00:01:45.120> bottom<00:01:45.450> line<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.900> that<00:01:54.470> so<00:01:55.470> it's<00:01:55.590> a

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
the bottom line is that so it's a

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.590 
the bottom line is that so it's a

Aleta<00:02:23.680> and<00:02:23.830> I<00:02:23.890> opened<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.580> stores<00:02:24.880> coaches

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
Aleta and I opened the stores coaches

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.920 
Aleta and I opened the stores coaches
and<00:02:26.100> we<00:02:27.100> both<00:02:27.250> have<00:02:27.520> 25<00:02:28.000> years<00:02:28.030> experience<00:02:28.780> in

and we both have 25 years experience in

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.550 
and we both have 25 years experience in
and<00:02:29.320> we've<00:02:29.920> estimated<00:02:30.130> we<00:02:30.550> probably<00:02:31.060> over

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
and we've estimated we probably over

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:38.600 
and we've estimated we probably over
$25,000<00:02:32.560> and<00:02:33.100> with<00:02:33.640> that

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.780

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
so often what you think we actually are

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.610 
so often what you think we actually are
two<00:02:42.970> different<00:02:43.330> things<00:02:43.510> and<00:02:43.810> one<00:02:44.440> of<00:02:44.470> the

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
things that we have found is a high
