00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
indeed you could almost say if you took

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.620 
indeed you could almost say if you took
the<00:01:19.530> back<00:01:19.860> glass<00:01:20.189> section<00:01:20.909> off<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.240> iphone

move around onto this side and you can

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.099 
move around onto this side and you can
see<00:02:22.549> we've<00:02:22.730> still<00:02:23.060> got<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.269> same<00:02:23.450> source<00:02:23.810> sim

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:24.109

microphone<00:02:44.120> so<00:02:45.079> I'm<00:02:45.169> assuming<00:02:45.290> it<00:02:45.769> just

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
microphone so I'm assuming it just

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.839 
microphone so I'm assuming it just
resides<00:02:46.489> somewhere<00:02:46.909> under<00:02:47.569> here<00:02:47.599> hidden<00:02:48.379> away

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
resides somewhere under here hidden away

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.159 
resides somewhere under here hidden away
then<00:02:49.849> let's<00:02:50.030> have<00:02:50.120> a<00:02:50.180> look<00:02:50.389> around<00:02:50.599> the<00:02:50.930> back

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:51.169 
then let's have a look around the back

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:53.080 
then let's have a look around the back
and<00:02:51.469> you<00:02:52.010> can<00:02:52.159> see<00:02:52.370> the<00:02:52.400> answer<00:02:52.879> to<00:02:53.000> that

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
and you can see the answer to that

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.300 
and you can see the answer to that

back to face the same way as the camera
now<00:03:00.290> we've<00:03:00.500> still<00:03:00.799> got<00:03:00.980> an<00:03:01.099> eight<00:03:01.280> megapixel

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
left and right on the iPhone 5 that's

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.030 
left and right on the iPhone 5 that's
because<00:03:56.900> of<00:03:56.989> the<00:03:57.079> different<00:03:57.439> shape<00:03:57.799> or

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
because of the different shape or

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.039 
because of the different shape or
different<00:03:58.340> formats<00:03:58.819> screen<00:03:59.209> but<00:03:59.780> the<00:03:59.840> actual

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
different formats screen but the actual

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.770 
different formats screen but the actual

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
colors are quite a bit different on the

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.289 
colors are quite a bit different on the
iPhone<00:04:03.139> 5<00:04:03.530> we're<00:04:04.280> getting<00:04:04.370> a<00:04:04.519> lot<00:04:04.639> punch<00:04:05.000> your

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
iPhone 5 we're getting a lot punch your

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.020 
iPhone 5 we're getting a lot punch your
colors<00:04:05.689> a<00:04:05.900> lot<00:04:06.349> more<00:04:06.500> contrast<00:04:07.189> the<00:04:07.759> whites

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
colors a lot more contrast the whites

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.300 
colors a lot more contrast the whites
are<00:04:08.269> definitely<00:04:08.900> whiter<00:04:09.169> and<00:04:09.560> a<00:04:10.009> little<00:04:10.189> bit

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
are definitely whiter and a little bit

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.580 
are definitely whiter and a little bit
more<00:04:10.459> detail<00:04:10.939> in<00:04:11.090> the<00:04:11.239> photo<00:04:11.449> as<00:04:11.719> well<00:04:11.900> just

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
more detail in the photo as well just

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.050 
more detail in the photo as well just
going<00:04:12.739> to<00:04:12.799> bring<00:04:12.949> this<00:04:13.069> up<00:04:13.129> inside<00:04:13.400> very

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
going to bring this up inside very

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.180 
going to bring this up inside very
slightly<00:04:14.659> just<00:04:15.319> so<00:04:15.439> that<00:04:15.560> we<00:04:15.650> can<00:04:15.769> just<00:04:15.799> see<00:04:16.099> it

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
slightly just so that we can just see it

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.279 
slightly just so that we can just see it
a<00:04:16.250> little<00:04:16.340> bit<00:04:16.549> closer<00:04:16.789> and<00:04:17.209> I<00:04:17.659> really<00:04:18.139> do

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:18.289 
a little bit closer and I really do

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:19.539 
a little bit closer and I really do
think<00:04:18.530> that<00:04:18.650> this<00:04:18.859> has<00:04:19.009> got<00:04:19.159> a<00:04:19.190> lot<00:04:19.250> more

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
think that this has got a lot more

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.300 
think that this has got a lot more
detail<00:04:20.239> it<00:04:20.840> looks<00:04:21.049> a<00:04:21.169> lot<00:04:21.289> more<00:04:21.349> accurate<00:04:22.099> to

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
detail it looks a lot more accurate to

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.330 
detail it looks a lot more accurate to
what<00:04:22.400> I<00:04:22.430> remember<00:04:22.940> the<00:04:23.029> original<00:04:23.360> photo<00:04:24.340> sort

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
what I remember the original photo sort

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.530 
what I remember the original photo sort
of<00:04:25.400> meaning<00:04:25.849> to<00:04:25.880> look<00:04:26.150> like

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
of meaning to look like

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.020 
of meaning to look like
I<00:04:26.600> think<00:04:27.230> this<00:04:27.350> is<00:04:27.530> a<00:04:27.560> much<00:04:28.130> better<00:04:28.160> screen<00:04:28.850> and

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
I think this is a much better screen and

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.820 
I think this is a much better screen and
a<00:04:29.090> much<00:04:29.240> better<00:04:29.600> rendition<00:04:30.290> of<00:04:30.440> this

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
a much better rendition of this

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.820 
a much better rendition of this
particular<00:04:31.160> photo<00:04:31.960> so<00:04:32.960> we<00:04:33.080> all<00:04:33.200> know<00:04:33.410> that<00:04:33.620> the

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
particular photo so we all know that the

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.280 
particular photo so we all know that the
iPhone<00:04:34.370> 5<00:04:34.700> is<00:04:34.730> about<00:04:35.120> the<00:04:35.270> same<00:04:35.450> width<00:04:35.840> as<00:04:36.080> the

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
iPhone 5 is about the same width as the

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.980 
iPhone 5 is about the same width as the
iphone<00:04:36.830> 4s<00:04:37.280> slightly<00:04:37.820> taller<00:04:38.090> but<00:04:38.570> certainly

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
iphone 4s slightly taller but certainly

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.470 
iphone 4s slightly taller but certainly
thinner<00:04:39.410> than<00:04:39.620> the<00:04:39.740> iphone<00:04:40.130> 4s<00:04:40.670> now<00:04:41.180> we<00:04:41.240> know

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
thinner than the iphone 4s now we know

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.820 
thinner than the iphone 4s now we know
from<00:04:41.600> the<00:04:41.690> spec<00:04:42.020> sheets<00:04:42.290> what<00:04:42.530> the<00:04:42.650> weights

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
from the spec sheets what the weights

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.230 
from the spec sheets what the weights
are<00:04:43.010> but<00:04:43.340> let's<00:04:43.460> have<00:04:43.610> a<00:04:43.640> look<00:04:43.820> at<00:04:43.880> them<00:04:44.000> for

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
are but let's have a look at them for

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.810 
are but let's have a look at them for
real<00:04:44.540> this<00:04:45.170> is<00:04:45.290> the<00:04:45.440> iphone<00:04:45.560> 4s<00:04:46.340> let's<00:04:46.670> see

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
real this is the iphone 4s let's see

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.790

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
what this weighs in that this is coming

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.690 
what this weighs in that this is coming
in<00:04:48.890> at<00:04:49.150> 140<00:04:50.150> 3.4<00:04:51.140> grams<00:04:51.470> now<00:04:52.250> let's<00:04:52.490> have<00:04:52.670> a

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
in at 140 3.4 grams now let's have a

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.500 
in at 140 3.4 grams now let's have a
look<00:04:53.000> at<00:04:53.210> the<00:04:53.750> iphone<00:04:53.780> 5<00:04:54.620> the<00:04:55.490> iphone<00:04:55.880> 5<00:04:56.240> is
