00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.370 
tight and it's gonna look like a mess
and<00:02:45.940> then<00:02:46.870> you<00:02:46.990> just<00:02:47.170> work<00:02:47.380> with<00:02:47.410> your<00:02:47.590> loops

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.300 
and then you just work with your loops
just<00:02:50.380> keep<00:02:50.680> in<00:02:50.950> mind<00:02:51.310> that<00:02:51.990> you're<00:02:53.310> tightening

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
you can do that because that will pull

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.930 
you can do that because that will pull
the<00:03:04.770> loop<00:03:05.770> ribbon<00:03:06.160> or<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:06.610> tails<00:03:07.570> back<00:03:07.960> out
