00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.030 
in a second I'm not sure what's in here
my<00:01:49.140> boobs<00:01:49.350> I've<00:01:50.130> causing<00:01:50.579> chaos<00:01:50.759> here<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:52.040> just

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
my boobs I've causing chaos here I just

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.209 
my boobs I've causing chaos here I just
pulled<00:01:53.250> out<00:01:53.310> back<00:01:53.460> up<00:01:53.689> and<00:01:54.689> here<00:01:55.290> we<00:01:55.409> go<00:01:55.439> so<00:01:55.890> I

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
pulled out back up and here we go so I

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.310 
pulled out back up and here we go so I
guess<00:01:56.340> that's<00:01:56.579> just<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.939> game<00:01:57.119> but<00:01:57.840> she<00:01:58.049> looked

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
guess that's just a game but she looked

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.980 
guess that's just a game but she looked
this<00:01:58.469> before<00:01:58.860> so<00:01:59.180> this<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.329> adam<00:02:00.570> fierce<00:02:00.780> and

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
this before so this is adam fierce and

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.270 
this before so this is adam fierce and
I've<00:02:01.049> actually<00:02:01.200> seen<00:02:01.469> this<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.770> some<00:02:01.950> light<00:02:02.130> in
