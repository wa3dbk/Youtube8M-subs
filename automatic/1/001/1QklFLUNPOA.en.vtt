00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:10.299
 Thank you in advance . This time the science of junior high school third grader 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:15.369
 We will send it with the animal's reproductive 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:19.150
 It was reproduction of whole plant, but this time it becomes animal 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:21.500
 8 sooo easy I mean here Easy 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:26.090
 Plant reproduction and most of the contents are women 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:32.000
 Since the leg new things I would say let me sleep What I do not come out massage 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:35.570
 As there is no problem with picture because it is filled in from 1 to 12 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.160
 If you can do this, please stop trying the video and try it 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.490
 I Nde go doing that woman while reading from now because I think that pc Some of the microphone 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.090
 Hey are not confident child 1 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:50.210
 I wonder if you would hear me 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:54.110
 I'm going to do it right away so thank you in advance 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:59.760
 Then let's go with three animals this time 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:05.640
 In Is not Well basically woman Hey male Guile Nde animal 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:10.430
 It germ cells make each because there are have you by it in female and male 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.430
 How Messes Make First 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:20.680
 The egg is a single kanji character, but the egg is said to be an egg 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.680
 Germ cells that stick to males 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:31.860
 Say 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:34.470
 It's a good misunderstanding that after all it's a bit of a human being and it's a little bent and the female's reproductive last 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.890
 Be careful with the often child or I astigmatism 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:41.880
 Because it is egg and sperm , these two 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.010
 It is another side that egg and spermatozoon unite 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.270
 Same as last time 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:50.539
 It is to unite 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.560
 I'm fertilization can at that time 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:57.670
 That of one of the cells 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:00.130
 This is also a fertilized egg that does not change 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.159
 Wait a minute 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:09.610
 I say that it is a fertilized egg 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:13.120
 It will divide cells Tonton Fertilized eggs can be taken by themselves 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:16.239
 It is the case of what selfish to say you animal things up 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.020
 Food by yourself 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:23.420
 You mean food 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.420
 Until you can take food 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.630
 I will eat without saying Western 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:38.490
 It is the same word as the last time 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:46.310
 Shape and be fertilized egg is changed by going to completed it in sound to make and function of the body good 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:46.310
 I 'm going to go high and open the things about the family I'm going to complete more and more like the previous time 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:53.629
 Say outbreak 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:03:00.579
 It's like this kind of feeling, and animals like germ cells are 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:03:00.579
 Since going to increase fertilized after all is basically a sexual reproduction 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:12.470
 Teacher diet here to say Some prefecture management Razz in the tone of voice ho while as becoming Likes However ho NYA 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:18.710
 Why this is half generated color 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:20.360
 I think in that it is the most famous that even in animals are on the Well textbook I'm there are asexual reproduction 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:24.130
 It is with this sandwiched morphism because 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:27.190
 We are living and this sea anemone 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.910
 Remember this nema Let's talk 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:36.900
 It will increase by asexual reproduction 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:40.200
 It's a bit of a bountiful word in the world. Let's change the answer before it changes. 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:44.730
 The answer also Honya et al that began to make 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:47.870
 It's a story about what a change is like, but let's start with words 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.870
 I Before you change 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:59.910
 I am positive because I was born young 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:04:03.180
 The guy got to make children change in rice young and like a fairy 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.740
 It is because it was completed 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:12.240
 Call a mobile 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:19.170
 In is a later pandering of frog Teru's to be issued well I'm also often served at this word 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:20.919
 It is a brush girl I think not good without many but fairy say in that frogs shops amblyopia 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:27.580
 To 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:32.180
 Since the vocal cords will be a normal habit, it is better to remember them as a set if you change them 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:35.849
 For a fairy and ecological and by all means thank you 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:41.009
 It is 4 and a half minutes of surprise 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:44.249
 Iiyoneko occasionally hit this time are we talking about the third-year junior high school big 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:47.430
 We sent about reproduction of animals 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:52.470
 Thank you very much if I have seen it this time 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:56.940
 In this and the last time or the last time or sexual reproduction Ney and asexual reproduction 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:05:03.180
 I did it, but the next video is these two 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:04.860
 I will draw attention and organize it , so it's an important place, so take a look if you can see it 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.420
 I am glad if you can 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:12.510
 Korea changed last but 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:12.510
 Thank you for today's more than it ends
