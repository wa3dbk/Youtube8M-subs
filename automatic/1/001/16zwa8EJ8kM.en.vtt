00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
the belly hook now you can make a

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.479 
the belly hook now you can make a
sardine<00:00:42.870> too<00:00:43.079> long<00:00:43.350> sometimes<00:00:43.890> guys<00:00:44.100> you'll

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
sardine too long sometimes guys you'll

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.330

the<00:00:47.460> plug<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:48.420> what<00:00:48.600> happens<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.440> it's<00:00:49.680> too

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
the plug and what happens is it's too

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.529 
the plug and what happens is it's too
much<00:00:50.160> weight<00:00:50.640> for<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.030> plug

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
much weight for the plug

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.950 
much weight for the plug
it'll<00:00:52.260> inhibit<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.739> action<00:00:53.030> also<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.660> reason

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
it'll inhibit the action also the reason

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.080 
it'll inhibit the action also the reason
I<00:00:55.020> like<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.230> have<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.649> down<00:00:55.860> here<00:00:56.399> as<00:00:56.550> opposed

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
I like to have it down here as opposed

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.529 
I like to have it down here as opposed
to<00:00:57.210> up<00:00:57.899> here<00:00:58.530> or<00:00:58.829> further<00:00:59.579> down<00:01:00.030> towards<00:01:00.480> the

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
to up here or further down towards the

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.450 
to up here or further down towards the
back<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.930> plug<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.379> again<00:01:01.739> you're<00:01:02.160> putting

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
back of the plug is again you're putting

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.609 
back of the plug is again you're putting
too<00:01:02.609> much<00:01:02.760> weight<00:01:02.820> forward<00:01:03.690> or<00:01:03.870> aft<00:01:04.080> on<00:01:04.470> the

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
too much weight forward or aft on the

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.700 
too much weight forward or aft on the
lure<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:05.519> if<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.700> slide<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.240> bait<00:01:06.840> right<00:01:07.049> to

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
lure so if you slide that bait right to

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.120 
lure so if you slide that bait right to
basically<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.640> center<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.180> plug<00:01:09.979> hold<00:01:10.979> it

centered on the lure belly itself as

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.390 
centered on the lure belly itself as
well<00:01:14.430> take<00:01:15.240> our<00:01:15.420> stretchy<00:01:15.720> thread<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.439> start

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
well take our stretchy thread and start

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.570 
well take our stretchy thread and start
wrapping<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:18.659> meat<00:01:18.930> on<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.590> plug<00:01:20.310> I'll<00:01:20.460> go<00:01:20.549> a

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
wrapping the meat on the plug I'll go a

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.780 
wrapping the meat on the plug I'll go a
little<00:01:20.610> more<00:01:20.820> slowly<00:01:21.180> here<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.659> can<00:01:21.780> see

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
little more slowly here so you can see

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.100 
little more slowly here so you can see
the<00:01:23.790> whole<00:01:23.939> time<00:01:24.150> I'm<00:01:24.360> kind<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.659> trying<00:01:24.990> to

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
the whole time I'm kind of trying to

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.609 
the whole time I'm kind of trying to
keep<00:01:25.170> this<00:01:25.470> thing<00:01:25.530> centered<00:01:30.350> wrapping<00:01:31.350> as<00:01:31.470> we

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
keep this thing centered wrapping as we

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.670 
keep this thing centered wrapping as we
go<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.700> we<00:01:32.939> want<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.240> slide<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.750> hook<00:01:33.840> towards

go and we want to slide the hook towards

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.490 
go and we want to slide the hook towards
the<00:01:34.740> back<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.250> then<00:01:35.340> get<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.670> front<00:01:36.030> part

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500

the<00:01:46.829> absolute<00:01:47.070> trick<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.149> thing<00:01:48.470> is

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
the absolute trick to this thing is

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:55.520 
the absolute trick to this thing is
wrapping<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.899> exactly<00:01:51.899> 70<00:01:53.090> 1.2<00:01:54.090> times<00:01:54.530> I'm

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
wrapping it exactly 70 1.2 times I'm

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.770 
wrapping it exactly 70 1.2 times I'm
just<00:01:55.590> kidding<00:01:56.009> we're<00:01:57.000> just<00:01:57.180> wrapping<00:01:57.540> this

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
just kidding we're just wrapping this

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.209 
just kidding we're just wrapping this
thing<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.170> it's<00:01:58.290> nice<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.680> tight<00:01:58.799> on<00:01:58.860> there

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
thing so it's nice and tight on there

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.550 
thing so it's nice and tight on there
and<00:01:59.969> we'll<00:02:00.210> finish<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.719> off<00:02:00.840> with<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.170> couple<00:02:01.500> of

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
and we'll finish it off with a couple of
