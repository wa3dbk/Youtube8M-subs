 hello friends i am who am i gamer 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.530
 welcome to this new tutorial on 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.210
 how to make centers in fifa 14 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.040
 Let's start by reviewing the three types of 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.230
 center the first is the normal center or 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.150
 pumped as we know this is 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.280
 perform by pressing the x button once 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.690
 this center should be used when 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.190
 you want to give your striker time 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.559
 accommodate yourself so you can earn the 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.180
 headshot here we see the examples 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.130
 If you have doubts about how to perform 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.540
 auctions see my tutorial about auctions 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.440
 of heads like the link that in this 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.440
 moment on the screen 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.960
 the second center is a middle or 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.510
 short this is done by pressing two 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.100
 times the button x this type of center is 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.660
 used in short distances and when 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.030
 the opponents can intercept the 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.560
 ball if you send a pass the ball does not 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.630
 goes flat but arrives faster to our 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.220
 He thus avoid giving time to 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.080
 opposites to mark the auctioneer and 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.220
 block the center remember the two 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.220
 times the x button 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.659
 friends we already saw the center pumped and the 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:35.030
 middle center now we have the third 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.250
 type of center center satin or fast 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.679
 this is done by pressing three times 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.270
 the x button quickly this center serves 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:43.399
 to pass the ball to the auctioneer very 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.350
 fast on long distances before 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:46.729
 cover it, take into account that as soon as 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.990
 the button is released x is due 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.270
 press the b button so that the 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.829
 receiver finishes and closes the clamp 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.209
 forget immediately press the 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:55.209
 b button to finish 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.459
 take into account that in playstation it is 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.530
 just just that the x button is the square 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.150
 and the b button is the circle so for 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.099
 summarize this tutorial friends the center 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.270
 Pumped is done by pressing once 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.490
 the button x 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:31.260
 the middle or short center is performed 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:33.599
 pressing the x button twice 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.269
 and the flat or quick center is performed 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:38.959
 pressing the x button three times 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.959
 quickly 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.050
 and friends remember the distances and 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.150
