00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Oh 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.209
 2014 is an extremely rich year 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:10.070
 for city-dwellers since after 

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:12.410
 new triplette citroÃ«n c1 peugeot 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.750
 108 and toyota aygo prono presents its 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:18.219
 third generation of twingo now 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.219
 designed in partnership with smart 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.890
 this partnership involves a lot of 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.180
 changes for the twingo that becomes 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.160
 a 5 doors 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.510
 this is the first time they have 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.489
 Now back up drive 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.989
 since his engine is now housed 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.989
 under the floor of the trunk 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.620
 so to access it if we want to adjust 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.910
 the oil level for example is very 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.160
 simple or almost 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:55.430
 just remove the floor from the 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:01:02.360
 chest removed the six screws from the sheet to 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:04.369
 the hand and then removed the plate that 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.510
 can be quite hot when we come from 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.470
 to roll so you have to be careful 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.689
 so if there is no engine up front 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.430
 what binds to eybens no chest 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:14.630
 in any case since the hood does not want 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.570
 really open up he can just 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.729
 slide forward you have to redo 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.600
 a new small manipulation remove 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.549
 the spots pull on the joysticks and 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.460
 then pull the hood towards you for 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:31.010
 access the drums and vocals of the 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.990
 place this new architecture 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.990
 involves a lot of changes on board 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.880
 especially in the back where the twingo loses 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.820
 its sliding bench and a lot of 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:45.620
 legroom 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:47.480
 same remark about the trunk that 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.150
 loses in height of change so we 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:53.240
 can gain a few liters in 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.710
 straightening the backs but 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.070
 so it's not very practical for 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.070
 settle 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.130
 either by folding back the passenger record is 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.340
 in this position we can load the 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.690
 objects up to two meters 32 years to 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.080
 the front we discover a dashboard 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.210
 quite ergonomic with a lot of 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.070
 customization possibilities too 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.290
 many storage often optional 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.930
 especially with this glove box that 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.130
 can be either open closed or 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.130
 textile commission 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.490
 renowned multimedia system side offers 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.890
 the airlink touch screen system 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.440
 well known renault be a version 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.140
 simplified that works with a 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.850
 smartphone and a dedicated app on 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.230
 which one can access either the music 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:44.020
 either on the phone or at the navigation 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.900
 allows to have an embedded GPS and we have 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.750
 also the possibility of seeing a 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.990
 board computer with consumption 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.160
 and even a small counter 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.660
 so we saw the engine placed at 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.370
 the rear created some disadvantages in 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.260
 matter of space on board on the other hand 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.640
 it drastically reduces the 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.680
 turning circle since the wheels 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.700
 before can turn a lot more than 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.550
 on a classic car 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.550
 in the city it feels like 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.000
 car literally turn on 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.160
 herself 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.930
 it's quite bluffing and that for the 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.930
 maneuverability it's a real plus 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.590
 then the other appreciable point when we 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.510
 roll in town like that is sweetness 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.600
 some orders 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.069
 it's really nice to the comfort of 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.290
 suspension is also very correct with 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.819
 the roads 15 inches the twingo absorbs 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.180
 rather well the speed bumps and the plates 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:39.180
 sewer then we roll here with the 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.120
 atmospheric version of 70 horses for 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.170
 the 3-cylinder gasoline engine 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.180
 it's a motor that's quite flexible in 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.040
 city is what is quite bluffing 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.980
 it's almost impossible to 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.959
 canet with one notes just a few 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.120
 small vibrations in slow motion and then a 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.680
 optional stop and start system which is 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.340
 a little bit abruptly at the restart we have 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.200
 a little snag then obviously for 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.019
 a road use we will prefer the 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.840
 90 hp version with a turbo that is 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.640
 much more comfortable with reminders 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.989
 and then finished with a note 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.220
 on the road holding because I know 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.620
 that it can intrigue some 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.570
 people driving a small car 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.669
 as short and light with wheels 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.530
 rearward drive on this point 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.230
 rest assured the twingo is very stable 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:25.470
 thanks to the anti-slip 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:28.620
 would agitate very early and that prevents any 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.910
 slip of the rear train is so much 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.920
 better for some and too bad for 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.380
 other 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.000
 with this 70 horsepower motor the twingo 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.160
 start from ten thousand 800 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.140
 euros or in an entry version of 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.860
 fairly stripped range the grains up 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:45.750
 13 1300 euros in rod finish and for 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.400
 find all the details of rates and 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.080
 of equipment can you go on the 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.850
 street site this point fr and I I 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.850
 See you soon for a new test
