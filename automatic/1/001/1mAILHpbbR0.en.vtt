00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
this so I could have my table to set

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.150 
this so I could have my table to set

this all up and measure everything out
that<00:00:56.699> was<00:00:56.850> quite<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.059> job<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:57.449> itself<00:00:57.570> because

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
that was quite a job in itself because

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.509 
that was quite a job in itself because
the<00:00:58.080> place<00:00:58.290> is<00:00:58.500> really<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.769> mess<00:00:59.040> but<00:00:59.250> I've<00:00:59.400> got

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519 
the place is really a mess but I've got

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:03.320 
the place is really a mess but I've got
it<00:00:59.640> pretty<00:00:59.730> well<00:00:59.879> cleaned<00:01:00.210> up<00:01:00.420> now<00:01:01.250> so<00:01:02.250> I'm<00:01:03.120> in

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.330 
it pretty well cleaned up now so I'm in

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.710 
it pretty well cleaned up now so I'm in
a<00:01:03.360> decision<00:01:03.930> time<00:01:04.110> now<00:01:04.409> with<00:01:04.620> this<00:01:04.739> bike<00:01:05.720> I'm

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
a decision time now with this bike I'm

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.920 
a decision time now with this bike I'm
not<00:01:07.050> going<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.320> make<00:01:07.440> it<00:01:08.360> from<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.510> original

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
not going to make it from the original

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.570 
not going to make it from the original
plans<00:01:10.229> I'm<00:01:10.500> going<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.710> change<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.130> some<00:01:11.370> for

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
plans I'm going to change it some for

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.690 
plans I'm going to change it some for
two<00:01:11.700> reasons<00:01:12.180> one<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:13.409> plans<00:01:13.710> call<00:01:14.070> for<00:01:14.130> an

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
two reasons one is the plans call for an

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.149 
two reasons one is the plans call for an
indirect<00:01:15.240> steering<00:01:15.690> with<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:16.159> searing

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
indirect steering with a searing

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.770 
indirect steering with a searing
actually<00:01:17.580> coming<00:01:17.850> out<00:01:17.970> underneath<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.450> sink

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
actually coming out underneath the sink

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.480 
actually coming out underneath the sink
with<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.049> lake<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.409> goes<00:01:19.799> up<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.010> the<00:01:20.190> front

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
with a lake that goes up to the front

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.719 
with a lake that goes up to the front
end<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:21.420> don't<00:01:22.020> particularly<00:01:22.979> care<00:01:23.159> for<00:01:23.430> that

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
end I don't particularly care for that

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.520 
end I don't particularly care for that
it's<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.240> little<00:01:24.450> complicated<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.200> it's<00:01:25.350> not

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
it's a little complicated and it's not

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.800 
it's a little complicated and it's not
what<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.710> want<00:01:26.010> for<00:01:26.190> my<00:01:26.280> first<00:01:26.610> bike<00:01:26.880> maybe<00:01:27.510> if<00:01:27.720> I

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
what I want for my first bike maybe if I

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.760 
what I want for my first bike maybe if I
was<00:01:27.960> going<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.170> go<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.320> little<00:01:28.440> more<00:01:28.619> high

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
was going to go a little more high

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.680 
was going to go a little more high
performance<00:01:29.369> I'd<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.729> might<00:01:30.000> go<00:01:30.210> with<00:01:30.360> that

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
performance I'd I might go with that

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.740 
performance I'd I might go with that
I<00:01:30.720> want<00:01:31.380> direct<00:01:31.710> steering<00:01:31.979> where<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.750> two

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
I want direct steering where the two

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.389 
I want direct steering where the two
levers<00:01:34.020> come<00:01:34.320> right<00:01:34.590> off<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.950> top<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.310> the

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
levers come right off the top of the

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:37.819 
levers come right off the top of the
kingpins<00:01:35.899> so<00:01:36.899> you're<00:01:37.079> steering<00:01:37.380> right<00:01:37.619> off

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
kingpins so you're steering right off

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.249 
kingpins so you're steering right off
the<00:01:38.100> red<00:01:38.549> off<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.880> front<00:01:39.119> wheels<00:01:39.359> and<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:40.079> also

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
the red off the front wheels and I also

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.120 
the red off the front wheels and I also
saw<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:41.070> on<00:01:41.369> YouTube<00:01:41.939> which<00:01:42.539> is<00:01:42.570> just<00:01:43.469> a<00:01:43.649> huge

saw it on YouTube which is just a huge

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
recumbent bikes that people have made

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:53.120 
recumbent bikes that people have made
and<00:01:50.789> factory<00:01:51.270> made<00:01:51.450> ones<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.049> people<00:01:52.469> touring

and factory made ones and people touring
in<00:01:53.280> Europe<00:01:53.609> we<00:01:54.119> probably<00:01:54.359> did<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:54.719> for<00:01:54.899> like

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
in Europe we probably did that for like

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.230 
in Europe we probably did that for like
three<00:01:55.320> hours<00:01:55.350> we<00:01:55.859> saw<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.130> lot<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.549> really<00:01:56.909> good

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
three hours we saw a lot of really good

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.230 
three hours we saw a lot of really good
ideas<00:01:57.299> one<00:01:58.109> of<00:01:58.289> them<00:01:58.439> was<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:59.609> the<00:01:59.820> arms<00:02:00.119> that

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
ideas one of them was that the arms that

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.249 
ideas one of them was that the arms that
come<00:02:00.390> back<00:02:00.630> from<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.079> pivot<00:02:01.979> point<00:02:02.130> right

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
come back from the pivot point right

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.319 
come back from the pivot point right
here<00:02:04.259> they<00:02:04.950> come<00:02:05.159> back<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.609> you<00:02:05.759> still<00:02:06.060> with

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
here they come back that you still with

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.529 
here they come back that you still with
I<00:02:07.520> thought<00:02:08.520> two<00:02:08.729> or<00:02:08.820> three<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.179> these<00:02:09.270> where

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
I thought two or three of these where

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.950 
I thought two or three of these where
they<00:02:09.660> had<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:10.020> arm<00:02:11.180> it<00:02:12.180> comes<00:02:12.360> up<00:02:12.540> here<00:02:12.720> comes

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
they had that arm it comes up here comes

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.450 
they had that arm it comes up here comes
back<00:02:13.170> come<00:02:13.410> right<00:02:13.560> over<00:02:13.680> by<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:13.980> edge<00:02:14.190> of<00:02:14.370> the

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
back come right over by the edge of the

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.730 
back come right over by the edge of the
wheel<00:02:14.640> and<00:02:15.030> then<00:02:15.569> they<00:02:15.720> put<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:15.960> caliper<00:02:16.380> right

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
wheel and then they put a caliper right

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.340 
wheel and then they put a caliper right
here<00:02:17.069> to<00:02:17.610> put<00:02:17.840> conventional<00:02:18.840> cantilever

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
here to put conventional cantilever

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.250 
here to put conventional cantilever
brakes<00:02:20.160> on<00:02:20.460> it<00:02:20.610> right<00:02:21.330> off<00:02:21.510> of<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.780> arm<00:02:21.960> and

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
brakes on it right off of the arm and

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.130 
brakes on it right off of the arm and
then<00:02:22.800> has<00:02:23.010> their<00:02:23.280> steering<00:02:24.120> right<00:02:24.330> here<00:02:24.750> with

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
then has their steering right here with

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.350 
then has their steering right here with
their<00:02:25.380> brake<00:02:25.680> handle<00:02:26.130> which<00:02:26.610> works<00:02:26.940> really

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
their brake handle which works really

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.050 
their brake handle which works really
well<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:28.380> it's<00:02:28.590> really<00:02:28.950> simple<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.760> more

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
well and it's really simple and more

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.520 
well and it's really simple and more
importantly<00:02:30.540> is<00:02:30.690> really<00:02:30.960> cheap<00:02:31.170> because<00:02:31.500> I

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
importantly is really cheap because I

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.370 
importantly is really cheap because I
don't<00:02:31.710> have<00:02:31.800> to<00:02:31.890> buy<00:02:32.010> disc<00:02:32.310> brakes<00:02:33.200> now<00:02:34.200> in

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
don't have to buy disc brakes now in

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.200 
don't have to buy disc brakes now in
order<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:34.770> have<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.130> direct<00:02:35.640> steering<00:02:35.910> I

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
order to have the direct steering I

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.680 
order to have the direct steering I
can't

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
can't

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:37.970 
can't
to<00:02:36.810> sweep<00:02:37.080> in<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.260> front<00:02:37.560> end<00:02:37.710> that<00:02:37.860> these

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
to sweep in the front end that these

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.560 
to sweep in the front end that these
original<00:02:38.220> plans<00:02:38.670> oh<00:02:38.790> I've<00:02:38.940> got<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.180> swing<00:02:39.420> the

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
original plans oh I've got to swing the

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.770 
original plans oh I've got to swing the
front<00:02:39.720> end<00:02:39.960> back<00:02:41.090> so<00:02:42.090> I've<00:02:42.210> got<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.450> do<00:02:42.570> some

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
front end back so I've got to do some

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.870 
front end back so I've got to do some
measuring<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.410> I've<00:02:43.680> got<00:02:43.890> to<00:02:43.980> you<00:02:44.070> know<00:02:44.100> got

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
measuring and I've got to you know got

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.430 
measuring and I've got to you know got
to<00:02:45.000> make<00:02:45.150> some<00:02:45.330> decisions<00:02:45.870> here<00:02:46.020> before<00:02:46.410> I

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
to make some decisions here before I

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.370 
to make some decisions here before I
start<00:02:46.770> cutting<00:02:46.980> steel<00:02:47.310> welding<00:02:47.940> but<00:02:48.540> I've<00:02:49.140> got

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
start cutting steel welding but I've got

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.640 
start cutting steel welding but I've got
in<00:02:49.950> our<00:02:50.100> government<00:02:50.930> on<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.080> original<00:02:52.410> plans

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
in our government on the original plans

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.830 
in our government on the original plans
they<00:02:52.860> built<00:02:53.130> this<00:02:53.340> from<00:02:53.790> scratch<00:02:53.970> from<00:02:54.630> this

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
they built this from scratch from this

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.410 
they built this from scratch from this
type<00:02:55.020> of<00:02:55.230> stock<00:02:55.530> and<00:02:56.190> I<00:02:56.310> decided<00:02:56.760> to<00:02:57.060> go<00:02:57.210> with

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
type of stock and I decided to go with

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.170 
type of stock and I decided to go with
this<00:02:57.540> because<00:02:57.950> it's<00:02:58.950> probably<00:02:59.250> no<00:02:59.700> heavier

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
this because it's probably no heavier

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.460 
this because it's probably no heavier
and<00:03:00.420> I<00:03:00.870> already<00:03:01.080> had<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.500> hand<00:03:02.340> if<00:03:02.940> idea<00:03:03.390> I<00:03:03.720> can

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
and I already had a hand if idea I can

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.290 
and I already had a hand if idea I can
put<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:04.680> shot<00:03:05.040> because<00:03:05.340> this<00:03:05.550> was<00:03:05.700> originally<00:03:06.270> a

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
put a shot because this was originally a

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.750 
put a shot because this was originally a
suspension<00:03:06.900> bike<00:03:07.110> and<00:03:07.440> a<00:03:08.010> shock<00:03:08.280> absorber

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
suspension bike and a shock absorber

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.250 
suspension bike and a shock absorber
where<00:03:08.880> the<00:03:08.970> spring<00:03:09.270> goes<00:03:09.480> in<00:03:09.660> right<00:03:09.840> here<00:03:10.020> so<00:03:10.080> I

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
where the spring goes in right here so I

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.160 
where the spring goes in right here so I
could<00:03:10.500> make<00:03:10.740> this<00:03:11.180> and<00:03:12.180> probably<00:03:12.720> will

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
could make this and probably will

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.110 
could make this and probably will
depending<00:03:13.650> on<00:03:13.800> how<00:03:13.980> brave<00:03:14.280> on<00:03:14.490> feel<00:03:14.760> in<00:03:14.970> there

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
depending on how brave on feel in there

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.120 
depending on how brave on feel in there
overwhelmed<00:03:16.020> at<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.260> time<00:03:16.470> probably<00:03:16.920> I'll

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
overwhelmed at the time probably I'll

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.130 
overwhelmed at the time probably I'll
make<00:03:17.310> it<00:03:17.430> a<00:03:17.490> rear<00:03:17.670> suspension<00:03:18.270> which<00:03:18.450> would<00:03:19.020> be

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
make it a rear suspension which would be

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.710 
make it a rear suspension which would be
nice<00:03:19.350> to<00:03:19.740> hit<00:03:19.860> a<00:03:19.890> bump<00:03:20.130> it<00:03:20.340> would<00:03:20.490> spring<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:21.330> I

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
nice to hit a bump it would spring and I

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.710 
nice to hit a bump it would spring and I
saw<00:03:21.960> the<00:03:22.590> exact<00:03:22.860> same<00:03:23.100> thing<00:03:23.430> on<00:03:23.640> a<00:03:23.730> few<00:03:24.450> bikes

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
saw the exact same thing on a few bikes

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.110 
saw the exact same thing on a few bikes
on<00:03:25.080> YouTube<00:03:25.830> where<00:03:26.100> they<00:03:26.220> had<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.610> exact<00:03:26.910> same

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
on YouTube where they had the exact same

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.030 
on YouTube where they had the exact same
thing<00:03:27.360> that's<00:03:27.540> real<00:03:27.750> pork<00:03:28.020> with<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.380> with<00:03:28.890> the

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
thing that's real pork with the with the

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.910 
thing that's real pork with the with the
suspension<00:03:29.460> in<00:03:29.760> it<00:03:29.790> which<00:03:30.630> is<00:03:30.870> a<00:03:30.920> reciprocal

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
suspension in it which is a reciprocal

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.310 
suspension in it which is a reciprocal
beliefs<00:03:34.370> looks<00:03:35.370> like<00:03:35.550> this<00:03:35.960> it's<00:03:36.960> a<00:03:37.080> shock

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
beliefs looks like this it's a shock

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.970 
beliefs looks like this it's a shock
absorber<00:03:37.830> and<00:03:37.860> a<00:03:37.950> spread<00:03:38.280> in<00:03:38.310> it<00:03:38.610> goes<00:03:39.480> up

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
absorber and a spread in it goes up

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.979 
absorber and a spread in it goes up
right<00:03:40.980> in<00:03:41.160> here<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:42.120> then<00:03:42.270> hooks<00:03:42.540> to<00:03:42.720> another

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
right in here and then hooks to another

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.470 
right in here and then hooks to another
beam<00:03:43.260> up<00:03:43.470> here<00:03:43.800> the<00:03:44.459> pivot<00:03:44.820> point<00:03:45.120> is<00:03:45.270> right

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
beam up here the pivot point is right

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.900 
beam up here the pivot point is right
here<00:03:45.690> so<00:03:46.320> that's<00:03:46.470> pretty<00:03:46.739> cool<00:03:47.010> you've

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
here so that's pretty cool you've

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.590 
here so that's pretty cool you've
probably<00:03:48.180> guessed<00:03:48.540> ah<00:03:49.730> now<00:03:50.730> that<00:03:50.760> I'm<00:03:51.180> having

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
probably guessed ah now that I'm having

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.890 
probably guessed ah now that I'm having
an<00:03:51.750> absolute<00:03:52.350> ball<00:03:52.739> doing<00:03:53.280> this<00:03:53.430> now<00:03:54.270> the<00:03:54.690> very

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
an absolute ball doing this now the very

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.170 
an absolute ball doing this now the very
first<00:03:55.230> one<00:03:55.500> I'm<00:03:55.650> building<00:03:56.070> this<00:03:56.250> one<00:03:56.489> is<00:03:57.150> a

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
first one I'm building this one is a

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.640 
first one I'm building this one is a
learner<00:03:57.630> I'm<00:03:57.900> going<00:03:58.050> to<00:03:58.110> make<00:03:58.260> all<00:03:58.470> my

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
learner I'm going to make all my

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.100 
learner I'm going to make all my
mistakes<00:03:59.130> on<00:03:59.400> this<00:03:59.550> one<00:03:59.820> or<00:04:00.090> a<00:04:00.150> lot<00:04:00.660> of<00:04:00.780> minus
