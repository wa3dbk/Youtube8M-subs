00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
okay so in this lesson we're going to go

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.070 
okay so in this lesson we're going to go
through<00:00:02.280> how<00:00:02.820> to<00:00:02.850> add<00:00:03.120> a<00:00:03.149> stereo<00:00:03.510> camera<00:00:03.870> and

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
through how to add a stereo camera and

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.390 
through how to add a stereo camera and
some<00:00:04.440> of<00:00:04.529> the<00:00:04.589> main<00:00:04.740> attributes<00:00:05.190> will<00:00:05.310> be

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
some of the main attributes will be

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.920 
some of the main attributes will be
changing<00:00:05.850> in<00:00:05.970> order<00:00:06.270> to<00:00:06.390> get<00:00:06.509> your<00:00:06.540> stereo

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
changing in order to get your stereo

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.290 
changing in order to get your stereo
effect<00:00:07.020> so<00:00:07.980> anything<00:00:08.280> we've<00:00:08.730> just<00:00:08.910> got<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.120> few

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
effect so anything we've just got a few

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.900 
effect so anything we've just got a few
elements<00:00:09.630> cost<00:00:10.260> camera<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:11.010> further<00:00:11.309> away<00:00:11.460> to

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
elements cost camera and further away to

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.180 
elements cost camera and further away to
show<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.509> stereo<00:00:12.809> effect<00:00:12.900> so<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:13.920> add<00:00:14.160> a

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
show the stereo effect so to add a

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.609 
show the stereo effect so to add a
camera<00:00:14.549> you<00:00:14.670> can<00:00:14.730> I've<00:00:14.880> got<00:00:14.910> to<00:00:15.120> create

now<00:00:32.309> what<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:32.579> means<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:33.260> if<00:00:34.260> we<00:00:34.890> go<00:00:35.010> back<00:00:35.160> to

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
now what that means is if we go back to

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.420 
now what that means is if we go back to
perspective<00:00:36.710> we<00:00:37.710> take<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.950> look<00:00:38.100> at<00:00:38.280> the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
perspective we take a look at the

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.610 
perspective we take a look at the
cameras<00:00:38.760> it's<00:00:38.910> added<00:00:39.210> as<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:40.020> can<00:00:40.170> see<00:00:40.350> it's

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
cameras it's added as you can see it's

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.920

alec free cameras now the one we were
looking<00:00:42.960> for<00:00:43.290> when<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.680> said<00:00:43.770> center<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.309> this

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
looking for when it said center is this

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.580 
looking for when it said center is this
Center<00:00:44.879> camp<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.809> center<00:00:46.079> cameras<00:00:46.410> used

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
Center camp and the center cameras used

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.110 
Center camp and the center cameras used
for<00:00:46.770> previewing<00:00:47.160> purposes<00:00:47.670> if<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:47.910> do<00:00:48.030> in

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
for previewing purposes if you do in

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.850 
for previewing purposes if you do in
animation<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:49.140> look<00:00:49.289> through<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.590> center

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
animation you look through the center

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.130 
animation you look through the center
camp<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.280> see<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.760> general<00:00:51.239> area<00:00:51.449> that's

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
camp to see the general area that's

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.900 
camp to see the general area that's
going<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.379> be<00:00:52.440> rendered<00:00:52.710> out<00:00:52.860> there's<00:00:53.760> and

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
going to be rendered out there's and

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.580 
going to be rendered out there's and
then<00:00:54.030> there's<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.300> left<00:00:54.539> camera<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.379> right

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
then there's a left camera and a right

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.720 
then there's a left camera and a right
camera<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.160> they're<00:00:56.250> going<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.520> be<00:00:56.610> the

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
camera and they're going to be the

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.209 
camera and they're going to be the
rendered<00:00:57.510> cameras<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.680> left<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.160> right

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
rendered cameras to the left and right

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.060 
rendered cameras to the left and right
image<00:00:59.609> so<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.660> same<00:01:00.840> Center<00:01:01.260> camera<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.770> just

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
image so the same Center camera is just

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.490 
image so the same Center camera is just
the<00:01:02.219> pre<00:01:02.430> viewing<00:01:02.640> purposes<00:01:03.049> so<00:01:04.049> if<00:01:04.290> we<00:01:04.320> get

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
the pre viewing purposes so if we get

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.899 
the pre viewing purposes so if we get
the<00:01:04.619> option<00:01:04.739> box<00:01:05.040> up<00:01:05.250> can<00:01:05.460> see<00:01:05.610> some<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
the option box up can see some of the

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.969 
the option box up can see some of the
options<00:01:06.060> in<00:01:06.360> here<00:01:07.549> so<00:01:08.630> first<00:01:09.630> off<00:01:09.920> we'll<00:01:10.920> go

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
options in here so first off we'll go

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.179 
options in here so first off we'll go
down<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:12.229> there's<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.290> type<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.530> stereo<00:01:14.010> off

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
down and there's a type of stereo off

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.550 
down and there's a type of stereo off
axis<00:01:15.030> in<00:01:15.600> these<00:01:15.840> trainings<00:01:16.259> we're<00:01:16.380> going<00:01:16.500> to

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
axis in these trainings we're going to

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.460 
axis in these trainings we're going to
be<00:01:16.650> using<00:01:16.680> off<00:01:17.070> axis<00:01:17.490> which<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.880> new<00:01:18.119> type<00:01:18.360> of

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
be using off axis which is a new type of

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.810 
be using off axis which is a new type of
stereo<00:01:19.470> but<00:01:20.130> if<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.310> want<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.520> can<00:01:20.610> use<00:01:20.790> it

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
stereo but if you want you can use it

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.880 
stereo but if you want you can use it
firms<00:01:21.180> like<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:21.780> converged<00:01:22.229> which<00:01:22.650> went

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
firms like this is converged which went

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.520 
firms like this is converged which went
on<00:01:23.009> earlier<00:01:23.509> which<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.540> like<00:01:24.840> crossing<00:01:25.500> the

on earlier which is like crossing the
eyes<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.979> there's<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.520> parallel<00:01:26.820> which<00:01:27.240> is

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
eyes and there's a parallel which is

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.609 
eyes and there's a parallel which is
diverging<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.200> eyes<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.500> go<00:01:28.619> forward<00:01:29.210> now<00:01:30.210> in

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
diverging the eyes to go forward now in

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.600 
diverging the eyes to go forward now in
what<00:01:31.619> we're<00:01:31.710> going<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.920> go<00:01:32.009> through<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.340> the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
what we're going to go through is the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.870 
what we're going to go through is the
men<00:01:32.880> two<00:01:33.470> options<00:01:34.470> which<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.189> interaction

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
men two options which is interaction

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.450 
men two options which is interaction
separation<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.780> zero<00:01:37.049> parallax<00:01:37.530> so<00:01:38.340> what

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
separation and zero parallax so what

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.770 
separation and zero parallax so what
these<00:01:38.579> mean<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.240> interactable

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
these mean is the interactable

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.870 
these mean is the interactable
separation<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:41.509> 6.3<00:01:42.710> Maya<00:01:43.710> units<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:44.759> this

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
separation so 6.3 Maya units in this

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.749 
separation so 6.3 Maya units in this
case<00:01:45.180> we've<00:01:45.570> got<00:01:45.840> two<00:01:45.990> settings<00:01:46.520> or<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.610> can

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
case we've got two settings or you can

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.410

centimeters<00:01:57.869> so<00:01:58.740> our<00:01:59.070> work<00:01:59.250> in<00:01:59.369> units

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
centimeters so our work in units

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.819 
centimeters so our work in units
centimeters<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:00.689> what<00:02:00.840> this<00:02:00.960> unit<00:02:01.380> means<00:02:01.560> is

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
centimeters so what this unit means is

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.160 
centimeters so what this unit means is
six<00:02:02.130> point<00:02:02.340> three<00:02:02.430> centimeters<00:02:03.180> now<00:02:03.360> that

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
six point three centimeters now that

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.870 
six point three centimeters now that
means<00:02:04.409> six<00:02:04.829> point<00:02:05.070> three<00:02:05.100> centimeters

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
means six point three centimeters

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.789 
means six point three centimeters
because<00:02:06.090> that's<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.810> distance<00:02:07.020> between<00:02:07.350> two

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
because that's the distance between two

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.249 
because that's the distance between two
adult<00:02:08.250> pupils<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:09.660> that's<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.080> distance

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
adult pupils so that's the distance

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.750 
adult pupils so that's the distance
between<00:02:10.560> these<00:02:10.830> cameras<00:02:11.280> so<00:02:11.430> that's<00:02:11.640> how

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
between these cameras so that's how

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.640 
between these cameras so that's how
these<00:02:12.000> represent<00:02:12.599> your<00:02:12.660> left<00:02:12.989> and

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
these represent your left and

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.679 
these represent your left and
I<00:02:14.000> but<00:02:15.140> inside<00:02:16.140> of<00:02:16.260> Maya<00:02:16.439> if<00:02:16.769> you're<00:02:17.010> seen<00:02:17.689> like

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:18.689 
I but inside of Maya if you're seen like

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:21.559 
I but inside of Maya if you're seen like
this<00:02:18.930> character<00:02:19.290> he's<00:02:19.709> and<00:02:20.030> scales<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.540> a

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
this character he's and scales to a

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.199 
this character he's and scales to a
normal-sized<00:02:22.230> character<00:02:22.739> so<00:02:23.159> in<00:02:23.370> this<00:02:23.849> actual

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
normal-sized character so in this actual

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.030 
normal-sized character so in this actual
scene<00:02:24.450> in<00:02:24.689> centimeters<00:02:25.260> he's<00:02:25.470> probably<00:02:25.650> 50

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
scene in centimeters he's probably 50

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.520 
scene in centimeters he's probably 50
centimeters<00:02:26.579> which<00:02:27.180> isn't<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:28.049> normal<00:02:28.319> size

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
centimeters which isn't the normal size

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.920 
centimeters which isn't the normal size
so<00:02:29.519> you<00:02:29.939> might<00:02:30.150> have<00:02:30.299> to<00:02:30.359> change<00:02:30.720> this

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
so you might have to change this

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.660 
so you might have to change this
depending<00:02:31.470> on<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.739> size<00:02:31.950> of<00:02:32.069> your<00:02:32.159> character

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
depending on the size of your character

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.569 
depending on the size of your character
to<00:02:32.849> get<00:02:33.209> these<00:02:33.390> to<00:02:33.629> represent<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.500> same<00:02:34.739> scale

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
to get these to represent the same scale

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:38.750 
to get these to represent the same scale
as<00:02:35.609> his<00:02:35.970> eyes<00:02:36.150> otherwise<00:02:37.079> if<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:38.400> character

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
as his eyes otherwise if the character

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.449 
as his eyes otherwise if the character
is<00:02:38.790> smaller<00:02:39.239> and<00:02:39.569> these<00:02:40.349> eyes<00:02:40.560> are<00:02:40.769> too<00:02:40.920> like

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
is smaller and these eyes are too like

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.300 
is smaller and these eyes are too like
these<00:02:42.000> dies<00:02:42.269> too<00:02:42.540> wide<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.799> scene<00:02:44.010> is<00:02:44.129> going

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
these dies too wide the scene is going

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.699 
these dies too wide the scene is going
to<00:02:44.370> appear<00:02:44.819> quite<00:02:45.180> small<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:45.840> then<00:02:46.019> again<00:02:46.440> if

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
to appear quite small and then again if

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.430 
to appear quite small and then again if
he<00:02:47.310> characters<00:02:47.730> too<00:02:47.909> large<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:49.109> distance

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
he characters too large and the distance

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.199 
he characters too large and the distance
between<00:02:49.500> these<00:02:49.799> are<00:02:49.980> too<00:02:50.099> small<00:02:50.209> the

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
between these are too small the

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.309 
between these are too small the
character<00:02:51.510> is<00:02:51.540> going<00:02:51.690> to<00:02:51.750> look<00:02:51.870> really<00:02:52.079> really

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
character is going to look really really

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.229 
character is going to look really really
big<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:53.129> might<00:02:53.310> want<00:02:53.489> to<00:02:53.519> spread<00:02:53.790> some<00:02:53.849> sort

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
big you might want to spread some sort

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.819 
big you might want to spread some sort
of<00:02:54.299> effect<00:02:54.569> well<00:02:54.780> as<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:54.959> big<00:02:55.109> character<00:02:55.590> so<00:02:55.769> you

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
of effect well as a big character so you

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.530 
of effect well as a big character so you
can<00:02:56.280> take<00:02:56.459> that<00:02:56.639> into<00:02:56.790> consideration<00:02:56.819> as<00:02:57.480> well

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
can take that into consideration as well

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.440 
can take that into consideration as well
but<00:02:58.349> this<00:02:58.590> just<00:02:58.829> separates<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.519> eyes<00:02:59.639> now<00:03:00.389> the

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
but this just separates the eyes now the

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.589 
but this just separates the eyes now the
0<00:03:00.750> parallax<00:03:01.290> as<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:02.579> can<00:03:02.700> see<00:03:02.909> if<00:03:03.150> you<00:03:03.269> changes

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
0 parallax as you can see if you changes

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.629 
0 parallax as you can see if you changes
a<00:03:03.659> zero<00:03:03.959> parallax<00:03:04.379> nothing<00:03:05.099> seems<00:03:05.430> to<00:03:05.549> be

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:05.639 
a zero parallax nothing seems to be

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:08.869 
a zero parallax nothing seems to be
changing<00:03:05.840> so<00:03:06.840> we<00:03:07.560> need<00:03:07.829> to<00:03:07.950> actually<00:03:08.040> view<00:03:08.670> and

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
changing so we need to actually view and

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.910 
changing so we need to actually view and
look<00:03:09.209> through<00:03:09.389> the<00:03:09.540> cameras<00:03:09.840> so<00:03:10.439> to<00:03:10.500> look

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
look through the cameras so to look

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.899 
look through the cameras so to look
through<00:03:11.129> the<00:03:11.250> cameras<00:03:11.659> will<00:03:12.659> go<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:12.900> stereo

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:13.909 
through the cameras will go to stereo

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
a life cameron says at the bottom left

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.470 
a life cameron says at the bottom left
or<00:03:28.019> we<00:03:28.169> can<00:03:28.319> go<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.069> right<00:03:29.250> I'll<00:03:29.430> center<00:03:29.879> so

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
or we can go to the right I'll center so

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.369 
or we can go to the right I'll center so
for<00:03:30.659> now<00:03:30.720> we'll<00:03:30.959> go<00:03:31.109> for<00:03:31.199> the<00:03:31.290> senator<00:03:33.319> ok<00:03:34.319> so

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379 
for now we'll go for the senator ok so

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:37.129 
for now we'll go for the senator ok so
we<00:03:34.980> will<00:03:35.069> complete<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.370> setup<00:03:35.579> I've<00:03:36.109> had<00:03:37.109> a

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
we will complete the setup I've had a

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:39.050 
we will complete the setup I've had a
problem<00:03:37.440> there<00:03:37.709> where<00:03:37.980> this<00:03:38.129> North<00:03:38.549> stereo

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
problem there where this North stereo

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.909 
problem there where this North stereo
there<00:03:39.239> should<00:03:39.389> be<00:03:39.480> a<00:03:39.510> stereo<00:03:39.900> here<00:03:40.139> so<00:03:40.650> if<00:03:40.889> you

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:40.919 
there should be a stereo here so if you

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:42.649 
there should be a stereo here so if you
having<00:03:41.190> this<00:03:41.280> problem<00:03:41.549> we<00:03:41.970> can<00:03:42.150> do<00:03:42.269> is<00:03:42.389> go<00:03:42.599> to

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:42.659 
having this problem we can do is go to

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:46.490 
having this problem we can do is go to
perspective<00:03:44.060> go<00:03:45.060> panels<00:03:45.449> stereo<00:03:45.989> and<00:03:46.260> click

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
perspective go panels stereo and click

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.099 
perspective go panels stereo and click
on<00:03:46.650> stereo<00:03:47.220> camera<00:03:47.579> one<00:03:47.750> now<00:03:48.750> you'll<00:03:48.989> notice

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
on stereo camera one now you'll notice

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:52.309 
on stereo camera one now you'll notice
this<00:03:49.560> option<00:03:49.979> here<00:03:50.010> stereo<00:03:50.790> appears<00:03:51.209> so<00:03:52.079> if

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
this option here stereo appears so if

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:53.599 
this option here stereo appears so if
you<00:03:52.440> can't<00:03:52.620> find<00:03:52.769> that<00:03:53.010> just<00:03:53.159> go<00:03:53.340> through<00:03:53.489> that

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
to see some sort of a 3d effect it's not

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.769 
to see some sort of a 3d effect it's not
very<00:04:37.740> agreeable<00:04:38.370> but<00:04:39.150> there's<00:04:39.330> a<00:04:39.419> little<00:04:39.599> bit

00:04:39.769 --> 00:04:39.779 
very agreeable but there's a little bit

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:41.269 
very agreeable but there's a little bit
there<00:04:39.930> but<00:04:40.139> this<00:04:40.349> is<00:04:40.500> just<00:04:40.529> using<00:04:40.889> the<00:04:41.099> default

00:04:41.269 --> 00:04:41.279 
there but this is just using the default

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:45.080 
there but this is just using the default
settings<00:04:41.849> so<00:04:42.479> now<00:04:43.849> looking<00:04:44.849> through<00:04:44.969> the

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
settings so now looking through the

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.600 
settings so now looking through the
stereo<00:04:45.300> camera<00:04:45.810> if<00:04:45.930> we<00:04:46.139> adjust<00:04:46.229> zero<00:04:47.099> parallax

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
stereo camera if we adjust zero parallax

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.839 
stereo camera if we adjust zero parallax
as<00:04:48.289> you<00:04:49.289> can<00:04:49.440> see<00:04:49.680> it's<00:04:50.219> adjusting<00:04:50.760> the

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:50.849 
as you can see it's adjusting the

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:53.779 
as you can see it's adjusting the
separation<00:04:51.539> of<00:04:51.630> the<00:04:51.690> two<00:04:51.779> images<00:04:52.580> so<00:04:53.580> you<00:04:53.669> can

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:53.789 
separation of the two images so you can

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:56.240 
separation of the two images so you can
see<00:04:53.940> the<00:04:54.270> red<00:04:54.479> and<00:04:54.570> cyan<00:04:54.779> the<00:04:55.289> red<00:04:55.560> and<00:04:56.159> the

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
see the red and cyan the red and the

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.029 
see the red and cyan the red and the
Scion<00:04:56.610> image<00:04:56.849> is<00:04:57.000> separating<00:04:57.659> apart<00:04:57.960> now<00:04:58.740> what

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 
Scion image is separating apart now what

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:00.740 
Scion image is separating apart now what
does<00:04:59.130> this<00:04:59.190> absolutely<00:04:59.610> mean<00:04:59.789> what<00:05:00.599> this

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
does this absolutely mean what this

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.540 
does this absolutely mean what this
means<00:05:01.020> is<00:05:01.380> as<00:05:01.760> you<00:05:02.760> just<00:05:03.289> the<00:05:04.289> two<00:05:04.469> images<00:05:04.590> if

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
means is as you just the two images if

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.580 
means is as you just the two images if
you<00:05:05.669> look<00:05:05.789> at<00:05:05.940> this<00:05:06.060> character<00:05:06.539> here<00:05:06.870> in

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
you look at this character here in

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.560 
you look at this character here in
particular<00:05:07.919> if<00:05:08.279> we<00:05:08.490> wanted<00:05:08.820> the<00:05:09.270> zero

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
particular if we wanted the zero

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.110 
particular if we wanted the zero
parallax<00:05:10.080> to<00:05:10.289> be<00:05:10.380> on<00:05:10.500> that<00:05:10.529> character<00:05:11.120> what

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
parallax to be on that character what

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.040 
parallax to be on that character what
that<00:05:12.240> means<00:05:12.479> is<00:05:13.460> zero<00:05:14.460> parallax<00:05:14.909> is<00:05:15.210> nor<00:05:15.810> depth

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
that means is zero parallax is nor depth

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.190 
that means is zero parallax is nor depth
which<00:05:16.620> means<00:05:16.889> on<00:05:17.159> the<00:05:17.669> screen<00:05:18.000> or<00:05:18.210> whatever

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
which means on the screen or whatever

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.769 
which means on the screen or whatever
you're<00:05:19.380> viewing<00:05:19.650> it<00:05:19.740> on<00:05:19.860> so<00:05:20.550> at<00:05:21.240> this<00:05:21.450> point

00:05:21.769 --> 00:05:21.779 
you're viewing it on so at this point

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:26.000 
you're viewing it on so at this point
the<00:05:22.409> two<00:05:22.620> images<00:05:24.020> match<00:05:25.020> together<00:05:25.469> which

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
the two images match together which

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.920 
the two images match together which
means<00:05:26.250> there's<00:05:26.430> no<00:05:26.490> depth<00:05:26.909> and<00:05:27.539> everything

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
means there's no depth and everything

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.379 
means there's no depth and everything
behind<00:05:28.110> there<00:05:28.710> goes<00:05:29.520> behind<00:05:29.880> the<00:05:29.969> screen<00:05:30.240> and

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:30.389 
behind there goes behind the screen and

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:32.029 
behind there goes behind the screen and
everything<00:05:30.479> in<00:05:30.840> front<00:05:30.960> like<00:05:31.289> this<00:05:31.409> chip<00:05:31.770> off

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 
everything in front like this chip off

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:34.459 
everything in front like this chip off
with<00:05:32.400> something<00:05:32.580> down<00:05:32.880> here<00:05:32.909> in<00:05:33.330> front<00:05:33.510> comes

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:34.469 
with something down here in front comes

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:37.430 
with something down here in front comes
out<00:05:34.680> and<00:05:34.889> in<00:05:35.010> front<00:05:35.219> of<00:05:35.340> the<00:05:35.430> screen<00:05:36.229> and<00:05:37.229> then

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
out and in front of the screen and then
