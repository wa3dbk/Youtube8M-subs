00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
often through very subtle and simple

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.159 
often through very subtle and simple
gestures<00:00:30.130> when<00:00:30.970> I<00:00:31.000> look<00:00:31.300> into<00:00:31.480> my<00:00:31.599> studio<00:00:31.930> I

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
gestures when I look into my studio I

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.060 
gestures when I look into my studio I
had<00:00:32.710> made<00:00:32.980> these<00:00:33.280> four<00:00:33.699> drawings<00:00:34.449> I<00:00:35.110> had<00:00:35.800> hung

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
had made these four drawings I had hung

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.640 
had made these four drawings I had hung
them<00:00:36.309> in<00:00:36.430> a<00:00:36.519> corner<00:00:37.000> with<00:00:37.809> tape<00:00:38.140> so<00:00:38.170> that<00:00:38.410> you

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
them in a corner with tape so that you

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.619 
them in a corner with tape so that you
could<00:00:38.830> kind<00:00:39.129> of<00:00:39.309> get<00:00:39.550> in<00:00:39.699> and<00:00:39.910> see<00:00:40.180> them<00:00:40.449> in<00:00:40.570> a

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
could kind of get in and see them in a

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:42.360 
could kind of get in and see them in a
relationship<00:00:41.230> to<00:00:41.379> each<00:00:41.410> other<00:00:41.680> and<00:00:41.890> I<00:00:42.129> showed

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
relationship to each other and I showed

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.090 
relationship to each other and I showed
that<00:00:42.400> to<00:00:42.699> Olga<00:00:42.879> and<00:00:43.180> she<00:00:43.330> instantly<00:00:44.100> grasped

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
that to Olga and she instantly grasped

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.299 
that to Olga and she instantly grasped
it<00:00:45.250> and<00:00:45.280> was<00:00:45.790> instantly<00:00:46.769> excited<00:00:47.769> to<00:00:48.070> buy<00:00:48.250> it

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
it and was instantly excited to buy it

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.890 
it and was instantly excited to buy it
and<00:00:48.640> I<00:00:49.379> guess<00:00:50.379> it<00:00:50.530> was<00:00:50.680> that<00:00:50.850> instantaneous

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:51.900 
and I guess it was that instantaneous

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.840 
and I guess it was that instantaneous
experience<00:00:52.900> that<00:00:53.080> was<00:00:53.229> then<00:00:53.409> shared<00:00:53.850> that

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
experience that was then shared that

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.060 
experience that was then shared that
then<00:00:55.059> was<00:00:55.330> built<00:00:55.570> on<00:00:55.780> I<00:00:56.290> mean<00:00:56.650> it's<00:00:56.830> awesome

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
then was built on I mean it's awesome

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.649 
then was built on I mean it's awesome
and<00:00:57.640> it's<00:00:57.729> also<00:00:57.940> somewhat<00:00:59.309> shocking<00:01:00.540> the<00:01:01.540> way

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:01.659 
and it's also somewhat shocking the way

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:04.320 
and it's also somewhat shocking the way
it<00:01:01.839> it<00:01:02.049> all<00:01:02.260> came<00:01:02.769> together<00:01:02.949> so<00:01:03.460> these

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
it it all came together so these

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.770 
it it all came together so these

metal<00:01:31.539> they<00:01:31.840> almost<00:01:31.990> look<00:01:32.200> like<00:01:32.229> they've<00:01:32.469> been

00:01:32.489 --> 00:01:32.499 
metal they almost look like they've been

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:35.910 
metal they almost look like they've been
just<00:01:32.979> washed<00:01:33.280> in<00:01:33.609> color<00:01:34.109> so<00:01:35.109> what<00:01:35.259> I<00:01:35.289> was<00:01:35.499> what

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
just washed in color so what I was what

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.739 
just washed in color so what I was what
I<00:01:35.950> was<00:01:36.159> concentrating<00:01:36.850> on<00:01:37.030> in<00:01:37.179> the<00:01:37.270> making<00:01:37.600> of

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:37.749 
I was concentrating on in the making of

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:39.539 
I was concentrating on in the making of
it<00:01:37.899> was<00:01:38.049> that<00:01:38.259> this<00:01:38.409> that<00:01:38.829> the<00:01:38.979> surface<00:01:39.399> would

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
it was that this that the surface would

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.849 
it was that this that the surface would
be<00:01:39.609> continuous<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:41.740> that<00:01:42.100> one<00:01:43.469> one's<00:01:44.469> I

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:44.859 
be continuous that that one one's I

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:50.010 
be continuous that that one one's I
would<00:01:45.729> be<00:01:47.640> passing<00:01:48.640> over<00:01:48.999> the<00:01:49.299> surface<00:01:49.689> of<00:01:49.810> it

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
would be passing over the surface of it

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.840 
would be passing over the surface of it
and<00:01:50.140> it<00:01:50.200> should<00:01:50.469> be<00:01:50.679> without<00:01:51.039> interruption

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
and it should be without interruption

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.459 
and it should be without interruption
that<00:01:51.880> one's<00:01:52.210> I<00:01:52.390> would<00:01:52.630> move<00:01:52.810> from<00:01:53.079> the<00:01:53.200> stone

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:53.469 
that one's I would move from the stone

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:55.340 
that one's I would move from the stone
to<00:01:53.770> the<00:01:53.799> to<00:01:54.249> the<00:01:54.369> pain<00:01:54.609> and<00:01:54.759> then<00:01:54.880> off<00:01:55.060> again

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
to the to the pain and then off again

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.010 
to the to the pain and then off again
there's<00:01:56.350> something<00:01:56.740> very<00:01:57.039> profound<00:01:57.850> about<00:01:58.659> a

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
there's something very profound about a

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.090 
there's something very profound about a
material<00:01:59.799> like<00:01:59.920> that<00:02:00.100> to<00:02:00.249> me<00:02:01.770> this<00:02:02.770> is

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
material like that to me this is

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.249 
material like that to me this is
something<00:02:03.340> that's<00:02:03.549> been<00:02:03.759> around<00:02:03.819> for<00:02:04.659> for

the entire campus

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.000 
the entire campus
I<00:02:33.209> think<00:02:33.659> the<00:02:33.750> work<00:02:33.900> exists<00:02:34.590> in<00:02:34.709> levels<00:02:35.129> of<00:02:35.400> of

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
I think the work exists in levels of of

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.849 
I think the work exists in levels of of
proximity<00:02:38.329> as<00:02:39.329> far<00:02:39.659> as<00:02:39.810> how<00:02:40.019> you<00:02:40.079> experience

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:40.859 
proximity as far as how you experience

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:43.490 
proximity as far as how you experience
the<00:02:41.250> work<00:02:41.400> whether<00:02:42.090> inside<00:02:42.599> from<00:02:42.959> a<00:02:43.049> distance

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
the work whether inside from a distance

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.000 
the work whether inside from a distance
close<00:02:43.920> by<00:02:44.159> whatever<00:02:44.659> I<00:02:45.659> think<00:02:46.290> that<00:02:46.590> that<00:02:46.739> for

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
close by whatever I think that that for

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.309 
close by whatever I think that that for
me<00:02:47.040> is<00:02:47.400> is<00:02:47.700> quite<00:02:47.970> satisfying<00:02:48.569> that<00:02:49.019> the<00:02:49.139> work

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
me is is quite satisfying that the work

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.089 
me is is quite satisfying that the work
has<00:02:50.299> multiple<00:02:51.299> access<00:02:52.139> points<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.680> also<00:02:52.889> in

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
has multiple access points and also in

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.490 
has multiple access points and also in
multiple<00:02:53.489> places<00:02:53.639> of<00:02:54.090> where<00:02:54.719> I<00:02:54.750> find

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
multiple places of where I find

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.860 
multiple places of where I find
satisfaction<00:02:56.129> in<00:02:56.370> it<00:02:56.819> even<00:02:57.450> though<00:02:57.540> this<00:02:57.659> is<00:02:57.840> a

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
satisfaction in it even though this is a

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.619 
satisfaction in it even though this is a
massive<00:02:58.409> monolithic<00:02:58.859> work<00:02:59.220> it<00:02:59.519> it<00:02:59.970> has<00:03:00.329> all

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
massive monolithic work it it has all

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.089 
massive monolithic work it it has all
the<00:03:00.780> qualities<00:03:01.200> that<00:03:01.230> some<00:03:01.709> of<00:03:01.829> Jim's

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
the qualities that some of Jim's

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.610 
the qualities that some of Jim's
smallest<00:03:02.700> you<00:03:03.209> know<00:03:03.329> most<00:03:03.659> impactful<00:03:04.169> pieces

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
smallest you know most impactful pieces

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.190 
smallest you know most impactful pieces
have<00:03:04.879> and<00:03:05.879> I<00:03:05.939> think<00:03:06.120> that<00:03:06.239> is<00:03:06.359> the<00:03:06.389> magic<00:03:06.930> of

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
have and I think that is the magic of

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.729 
have and I think that is the magic of
this<00:03:07.889> piece<00:03:08.159> is<00:03:08.519> how<00:03:09.269> it<00:03:09.450> seems<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:09.930> defy<00:03:10.349> what

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
this piece is how it seems to defy what

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.879 
this piece is how it seems to defy what
it<00:03:11.069> is<00:03:11.459> itself
