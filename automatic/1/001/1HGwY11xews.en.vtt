it's<00:01:16.650> continuing<00:01:17.159> down<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.670> how<00:01:17.790> birds

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
it's continuing down this is how birds

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.850 
it's continuing down this is how birds
are<00:01:18.330> broken<00:01:18.630> this<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.930> trick<00:01:19.200> everyone

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
are broken this is a trick everyone

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.740 
are broken this is a trick everyone
knows<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:22.610> so<00:01:23.610> if<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:24.000> break<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.420> bottom

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
knows it and so if you break the bottom

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.950 
knows it and so if you break the bottom
brick<00:01:25.369> nothing's<00:01:26.369> gonna<00:01:26.520> happen<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:27.299> doesn't
