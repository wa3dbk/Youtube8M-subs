wrong how'd you get done I mean is there
a<00:01:02.140> parachute<00:01:02.559> harness<00:01:02.860> of<00:01:02.979> any<00:01:03.100> kind<00:01:03.370> no<00:01:03.640> we

a parachute harness of any kind no we

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.240 
a parachute harness of any kind no we
let<00:01:03.970> rely<00:01:04.239> in<00:01:04.390> gravity<00:01:04.920> but<00:01:05.920> these<00:01:06.040> same

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
let rely in gravity but these same

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.070 
let rely in gravity but these same
pioneers<00:01:06.729> paved<00:01:07.060> the<00:01:07.240> way<00:01:07.270> for<00:01:07.390> radical

changes in transportation and making

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:12.359 
changes in transportation and making
what<00:01:10.420> we're<00:01:10.540> actually<00:01:10.750> going<00:01:11.170> to<00:01:11.410> get<00:01:11.619> even

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
what we're actually going to get even

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:15.690 
what we're actually going to get even
better<00:01:13.530> but<00:01:14.530> how<00:01:14.710> will<00:01:14.920> we<00:01:14.950> be<00:01:15.160> moving<00:01:15.310> around

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
better but how will we be moving around

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.400 
better but how will we be moving around
in<00:01:16.090> that<00:01:16.539> future<00:01:17.550> well<00:01:18.550> I'll<00:01:18.880> tell<00:01:19.119> ya<00:01:19.330> I<00:01:19.630> I

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
in that future well I'll tell ya I I

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.680 
in that future well I'll tell ya I I
don't<00:01:20.830> think<00:01:21.220> we're<00:01:21.759> gonna<00:01:21.940> be<00:01:22.240> beaming

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
don't think we're gonna be beaming

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.200 
don't think we're gonna be beaming
people<00:01:23.380> up<00:01:23.619> and<00:01:23.800> down<00:01:24.070> and<00:01:24.580> I<00:01:24.759> don't<00:01:24.820> think

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
people up and down and I don't think

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.230 
people up and down and I don't think
we're<00:01:25.420> gonna<00:01:25.600> travel<00:01:26.289> at<00:01:26.500> warp<00:01:26.530> seven<00:01:27.280> but<00:01:28.090> we

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
we're gonna travel at warp seven but we

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.969 
we're gonna travel at warp seven but we
have<00:01:28.479> communicators<00:01:29.200> now<00:01:29.440> I<00:01:29.710> haven't

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
have communicators now I haven't

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.740 
have communicators now I haven't
communicated<00:01:30.159> else<00:01:30.670> in<00:01:30.819> my<00:01:30.909> cart<00:01:31.179> and<00:01:31.539> we<00:01:31.630> all

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
communicated else in my cart and we all

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.680 
communicated else in my cart and we all
have<00:01:31.960> communicators<00:01:32.590> now<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:34.240> jetpack

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
have communicators now the jetpack

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.840 
have communicators now the jetpack
concept<00:01:35.170> I<00:01:35.409> don't<00:01:36.399> think<00:01:36.550> that's<00:01:36.700> ever

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
concept I don't think that's ever

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.399 
concept I don't think that's ever
happening<00:01:38.399> you<00:01:39.399> don't<00:01:39.580> see<00:01:39.700> many<00:01:39.909> of<00:01:40.060> them

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
happening you don't see many of them

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.680 
happening you don't see many of them
okay<00:01:41.409> because<00:01:41.679> it's<00:01:42.310> somewhat<00:01:42.670> not<00:01:42.909> technical

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.690 

well<00:01:46.690> now<00:01:47.170> this<00:01:47.380> gets<00:01:47.679> into<00:01:47.950> flying<00:01:48.250> cars

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
well now this gets into flying cars

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.229 
well now this gets into flying cars
there's<00:01:49.360> several<00:01:50.259> models<00:01:50.800> of<00:01:51.239> experimental

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:52.239 
there's several models of experimental

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:53.609 
there's several models of experimental
flying<00:01:52.539> cars<00:01:52.840> they<00:01:53.080> never<00:01:53.259> have<00:01:53.410> come<00:01:53.560> to

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
flying cars they never have come to

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.499 
flying cars they never have come to
market<00:01:54.069> you<00:01:54.399> know<00:01:54.489> the<00:01:54.610> wings<00:01:54.789> came<00:01:55.060> off<00:01:55.270> and

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
market you know the wings came off and

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:57.359 
market you know the wings came off and
you<00:01:55.569> store<00:01:55.840> them<00:01:55.959> in<00:01:56.110> your<00:01:56.229> garage<00:01:56.379> trust<00:01:57.129> that

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
you store them in your garage trust that

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.550 
you store them in your garage trust that
to<00:01:57.640> your<00:01:57.789> local<00:01:58.179> you<00:01:58.479> know<00:01:58.539> guy<00:01:59.140> down<00:01:59.379> the

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:06.690 
guys want to go out so I'm gonna build a
flying<00:02:05.080> car<00:02:05.379> it's<00:02:05.649> like<00:02:05.800> it<00:02:06.009> will<00:02:06.220> never<00:02:06.489> ever

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
flying car it's like it will never ever

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.339 
flying car it's like it will never ever
I<00:02:06.849> mean<00:02:07.060> can<00:02:07.179> you<00:02:07.209> picture<00:02:07.300> Manhattan<00:02:07.899> that<00:02:08.170> is

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
I mean can you picture Manhattan that is

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:10.229 
I mean can you picture Manhattan that is
you<00:02:08.679> know<00:02:08.770> you<00:02:08.830> have<00:02:08.920> 25,000<00:02:09.700> old<00:02:09.970> flying

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
you know you have 25,000 old flying

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.619 
you know you have 25,000 old flying
around<00:02:10.420> you<00:02:10.810> simply<00:02:11.260> can't<00:02:11.530> do<00:02:11.709> it<00:02:12.480> we<00:02:13.480> have

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 
around you simply can't do it we have

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:16.110 
around you simply can't do it we have
fun<00:02:13.840> imagining<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.500> future<00:02:14.860> but<00:02:15.520> predicting

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
fun imagining the future but predicting

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.820 
fun imagining the future but predicting
things<00:02:16.270> accurately<00:02:16.810> as<00:02:16.959> proving<00:02:17.590> to<00:02:17.650> be<00:02:17.680> more

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
things accurately as proving to be more

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.979 
things accurately as proving to be more
challenging<00:02:18.360> because<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:19.629> future<00:02:19.810> we

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
challenging because the future we

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.600 
challenging because the future we
usually<00:02:20.290> get<00:02:20.530> is<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:21.160> one<00:02:21.310> we<00:02:21.459> least<00:02:21.670> expect

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
usually get is the one we least expect

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.890 
usually get is the one we least expect
I<00:02:25.880> think<00:02:26.880> the<00:02:26.970> innovation<00:02:27.090> that's<00:02:27.540> happened

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
I think the innovation that's happened

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.450 
I think the innovation that's happened
in<00:02:27.990> the<00:02:28.050> past<00:02:28.200> 20<00:02:28.530> years<00:02:28.710> isn't<00:02:28.920> what<00:02:29.100> anyone

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
in the past 20 years isn't what anyone

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.520 
in the past 20 years isn't what anyone
would<00:02:29.760> have<00:02:29.820> anticipated<00:02:30.000> I<00:02:30.720> think<00:02:31.200> it's<00:02:31.320> very

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
would have anticipated I think it's very

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.900 
would have anticipated I think it's very
easy<00:02:31.830> to<00:02:32.100> know<00:02:32.250> what's<00:02:32.430> gonna<00:02:32.520> happen<00:02:32.790> in<00:02:32.880> the

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
easy to know what's gonna happen in the

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.330 
easy to know what's gonna happen in the
next<00:02:32.970> six<00:02:33.330> months<00:02:33.420> because<00:02:33.930> you<00:02:34.020> know<00:02:34.340> mostly

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
next six months because you know mostly

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.250 
next six months because you know mostly
what's<00:02:35.580> going<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:35.820> be<00:02:35.910> possible<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:36.690> the

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
what's going to be possible and the

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.290 
what's going to be possible and the
question<00:02:37.530> is<00:02:37.620> how<00:02:37.740> can<00:02:37.860> you<00:02:37.920> push<00:02:38.190> it<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:38.550> five

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
question is how can you push it and five

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.090 
question is how can you push it and five
years<00:02:39.570> out<00:02:39.720> it<00:02:40.350> starts<00:02:40.590> to<00:02:40.680> me<00:02:40.770> you<00:02:40.920> know<00:02:41.040> you

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
years out it starts to me you know you

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.290 
years out it starts to me you know you
maybe<00:02:41.400> you'll<00:02:41.580> get<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.790> exactly<00:02:42.060> right<00:02:42.150> or

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
maybe you'll get the exactly right or

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.480 
maybe you'll get the exactly right or
maybe<00:02:42.540> you'll<00:02:42.690> be<00:02:42.780> really<00:02:43.110> far<00:02:43.320> off<00:02:43.350> track<00:02:43.800> as

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
maybe you'll be really far off track as

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.360 
maybe you'll be really far off track as
designers<00:02:45.180> in<00:02:45.420> our<00:02:45.570> minds<00:02:46.260> it's<00:02:46.950> not<00:02:47.130> about

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
designers in our minds it's not about

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.430 
designers in our minds it's not about
prediction<00:02:48.030> of<00:02:48.120> future<00:02:48.180> but<00:02:48.780> creational

prediction of future but creational
future<00:02:49.830> right<00:02:50.010> so<00:02:50.220> we<00:02:50.340> were<00:02:50.400> an<00:02:50.640> active

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
future right so we were an active

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.830 
future right so we were an active
partner<00:02:51.450> in<00:02:51.510> that<00:02:51.709> my<00:02:52.709> particular<00:02:53.430> event<00:02:54.180> is

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
partner in that my particular event is

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.410 
partner in that my particular event is
to<00:02:55.110> render<00:02:55.380> an<00:02:56.040> optimistic<00:02:56.550> future<00:02:57.060> because

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
to render an optimistic future because

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.320 
to render an optimistic future because
we're<00:02:57.959> rehearsing<00:02:58.370> for<00:02:59.370> our<00:02:59.580> own<00:02:59.730> future<00:03:00.180> why

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
we're rehearsing for our own future why

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.910 
we're rehearsing for our own future why
not<00:03:00.570> do<00:03:00.750> it<00:03:00.900> as<00:03:01.160> pleasantly<00:03:02.160> as<00:03:02.250> possible<00:03:03.920> so

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
not do it as pleasantly as possible so

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.020 
not do it as pleasantly as possible so
the<00:03:05.010> way<00:03:05.100> we're<00:03:05.280> going<00:03:05.430> to<00:03:05.520> be<00:03:05.700> moving<00:03:05.820> around

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
the way we're going to be moving around

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.150 
the way we're going to be moving around
is<00:03:06.420> tough<00:03:06.630> to<00:03:06.750> predict<00:03:07.140> and<00:03:07.680> while<00:03:07.860> we<00:03:07.980> made

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
is tough to predict and while we made

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.310 
is tough to predict and while we made
some<00:03:08.370> mistakes<00:03:08.700> in<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:08.910> past<00:03:09.150> there<00:03:10.140> have

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
some mistakes in the past there have

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.720 
some mistakes in the past there have
been<00:03:10.440> times<00:03:10.739> when<00:03:10.890> we've<00:03:11.040> taken<00:03:11.370> on<00:03:11.610> the

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
been times when we've taken on the

been times when we've taken on the
impossible<00:03:12.360> and<00:03:12.540> surprised<00:03:13.290> even<00:03:13.560> ourselves

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.050 

it's<00:03:20.230> an<00:03:20.380> exciting<00:03:20.830> time<00:03:20.860> right<00:03:21.340> now<00:03:21.610> in<00:03:21.760> space

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
it's an exciting time right now in space

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.540 
it's an exciting time right now in space
because<00:03:22.530> you<00:03:23.530> know<00:03:23.620> we're<00:03:23.770> right<00:03:23.950> at<00:03:24.160> the<00:03:24.190> cusp

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
because you know we're right at the cusp

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.990 
because you know we're right at the cusp
of<00:03:24.880> this<00:03:25.209> fundamental<00:03:25.660> shift<00:03:26.319> in<00:03:27.000> space

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000

of this fundamental shift in space
transportation<00:03:29.160> what<00:03:30.160> we<00:03:30.250> aspire<00:03:30.550> to<00:03:30.760> do<00:03:31.300> is

point-to-point spaceflight so that you

out to Wellington New Zealand I wanted

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.820 
out to Wellington New Zealand I wanted
to<00:03:55.239> take<00:03:55.420> six<00:03:55.690> can<00:03:56.260> you<00:03:56.350> imagine<00:03:56.470> how<00:03:56.709> much

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
to take six can you imagine how much

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.020 
to take six can you imagine how much

probably<00:04:10.269> what<00:04:10.750> comes<00:04:10.989> next<00:04:11.170> is<00:04:11.470> then<00:04:11.680> tourist

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
probably what comes next is then tourist

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.890 
probably what comes next is then tourist
trip<00:04:12.550> to<00:04:12.700> Saturn<00:04:13.060> or<00:04:13.209> that<00:04:13.330> choice<00:04:13.510> trip<00:04:13.780> to

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
trip to Saturn or that choice trip to

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.259 
trip to Saturn or that choice trip to
Mars<00:04:14.080> go<00:04:14.860> down<00:04:15.040> to<00:04:15.160> the<00:04:15.250> surface<00:04:15.459> plant<00:04:16.120> a

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
flower see if it grows I mean that's the

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.310 
flower see if it grows I mean that's the
kind<00:04:18.400> of<00:04:18.489> beautiful<00:04:19.359> moment<00:04:19.840> that<00:04:19.989> I<00:04:20.019> think

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
kind of beautiful moment that I think

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.370 
kind of beautiful moment that I think
the<00:04:20.410> next<00:04:20.680> 10<00:04:20.829> to<00:04:20.859> 20<00:04:21.160> years<00:04:21.340> will<00:04:21.519> hold<00:04:21.669> a<00:04:22.380> car

the next 10 to 20 years will hold a car
in<00:04:23.470> the<00:04:23.530> airplane<00:04:23.860> are<00:04:23.979> roughly<00:04:24.190> the<00:04:24.280> same<00:04:24.550> age

has yet to make the same breakthroughs
our<00:04:36.789> vehicles<00:04:37.300> are<00:04:37.419> more<00:04:37.570> comfortable<00:04:37.810> and

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
our vehicles are more comfortable and

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:40.050 
our vehicles are more comfortable and
efficient<00:04:38.590> than<00:04:38.710> ever<00:04:38.830> but<00:04:39.550> is<00:04:39.669> that<00:04:39.760> enough

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
efficient than ever but is that enough

to<00:04:40.240> meet<00:04:40.390> the<00:04:40.419> needs<00:04:40.539> of<00:04:40.870> our<00:04:40.990> future<00:04:41.490> we're

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
to meet the needs of our future we're

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.909 
to meet the needs of our future we're
redesigning<00:04:43.090> the<00:04:43.810> way<00:04:43.960> that<00:04:44.229> we<00:04:44.350> live<00:04:44.560> on

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
redesigning the way that we live on

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:46.350 
redesigning the way that we live on
earth<00:04:44.979> and<00:04:45.610> that<00:04:45.669> takes<00:04:45.970> a<00:04:46.060> little<00:04:46.150> bit

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
earth and that takes a little bit

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.790 
earth and that takes a little bit
because<00:04:46.510> we<00:04:46.660> have<00:04:46.690> to<00:04:46.870> get<00:04:46.990> that<00:04:47.169> change<00:04:47.620> to

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
because we have to get that change to

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.010 
because we have to get that change to
happen<00:04:47.979> and<00:04:48.430> designs<00:04:48.910> about<00:04:49.150> parameters<00:04:49.690> and

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
happen and designs about parameters and

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.469 
happen and designs about parameters and
cars<00:04:50.260> just<00:04:50.560> haven't<00:04:50.800> had<00:04:50.860> the<00:04:50.950> forces<00:04:51.490> put<00:04:52.330> on

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
cars just haven't had the forces put on

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.200 
cars just haven't had the forces put on
them<00:04:52.840> to<00:04:53.140> require<00:04:53.800> the<00:04:53.950> big<00:04:54.070> changes<00:04:54.460> you<00:04:55.120> know

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
them to require the big changes you know

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.760 
them to require the big changes you know
there's<00:04:55.450> not<00:04:55.600> too<00:04:55.660> many<00:04:55.930> products<00:04:56.530> that<00:04:56.680> you

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
there's not too many products that you

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.529 
there's not too many products that you
can<00:04:56.890> identify<00:04:57.100> that<00:04:57.520> have<00:04:57.850> had<00:04:58.030> this<00:04:58.240> same

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
can identify that have had this same

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:01.830 
can identify that have had this same
fundamental<00:04:59.410> genetic<00:04:59.890> makeup<00:05:00.370> for<00:05:00.970> over<00:05:01.120> 120

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
fundamental genetic makeup for over 120

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.000 
fundamental genetic makeup for over 120
years<00:05:02.080> and<00:05:02.350> so<00:05:03.250> we<00:05:03.490> are<00:05:03.729> in<00:05:04.090> a<00:05:04.360> transition<00:05:05.110> into

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
years and so we are in a transition into

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.790 
years and so we are in a transition into
a<00:05:06.039> sustainable<00:05:06.690> lifestyle<00:05:07.690> that's<00:05:08.289> not<00:05:08.500> a<00:05:08.530> bad

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
a sustainable lifestyle that's not a bad

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.750 
a sustainable lifestyle that's not a bad
thing

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
thing

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.030 
thing
this<00:05:10.940> is<00:05:11.090> different<00:05:11.630> we're<00:05:12.320> entering<00:05:12.560> into<00:05:12.800> a

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
this is different we're entering into a

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.760 
this is different we're entering into a
future<00:05:13.550> now<00:05:13.760> of<00:05:14.300> a<00:05:14.450> whole<00:05:14.690> new<00:05:14.900> DNA<00:05:15.380> for<00:05:15.680> the

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
future now of a whole new DNA for the

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.370 
future now of a whole new DNA for the
automobile<00:05:16.130> a<00:05:16.580> way<00:05:17.210> of<00:05:17.450> thinking<00:05:17.900> about<00:05:17.990> the

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
automobile a way of thinking about the

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.620 
automobile a way of thinking about the
car<00:05:18.650> and<00:05:18.920> how<00:05:19.070> it<00:05:19.250> fits<00:05:19.400> into<00:05:19.610> our<00:05:19.880> lives<00:05:20.150> along

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
car and how it fits into our lives along

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.300 
car and how it fits into our lives along
with<00:05:20.660> the<00:05:20.930> enormous<00:05:21.470> communications

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310

technology that we have to help us live

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.700

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
mobility

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.510 
mobility
all<00:05:29.330> right<00:05:29.480> that's<00:05:29.780> transportation<00:05:30.740> and<00:05:31.250> we

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
all right that's transportation and we

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.640 
all right that's transportation and we
have<00:05:31.640> new<00:05:31.850> generations<00:05:32.600> coming<00:05:32.900> along<00:05:33.350> and

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
have new generations coming along and

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.790 
have new generations coming along and
that<00:05:34.160> things<00:05:34.490> are<00:05:34.760> rapidly<00:05:35.420> increasing<00:05:35.900> and

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
that things are rapidly increasing and

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.650 
that things are rapidly increasing and
it's<00:05:37.460> time<00:05:37.910> now<00:05:37.940> to<00:05:38.690> move<00:05:39.440> on
