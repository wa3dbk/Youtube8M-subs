00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.880 

continue<00:01:55.940> along<00:01:59.110> actually<00:02:00.110> go<00:02:00.440> underground

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
continue along actually go underground

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.430 
continue along actually go underground
but<00:02:01.190> but<00:02:01.760> just<00:02:01.970> a<00:02:02.060> little<00:02:02.150> bit<00:02:02.300> to<00:02:02.900> the<00:02:03.020> east<00:02:03.200> of

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
but but just a little bit to the east of

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.090 
but but just a little bit to the east of
here<00:02:04.270> is<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:05.600> harbour<00:02:05.990> ferry<00:02:06.260> docks<00:02:06.619> where

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
here is the harbour ferry docks where

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.100 
here is the harbour ferry docks where
you<00:02:07.250> can<00:02:07.490> take<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.729> berries<00:02:08.179> across<00:02:08.539> the

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
you can take the berries across the

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.360 
you can take the berries across the
islands<00:02:09.850> man-made

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
islands man-made

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.910 
islands man-made
I<00:02:12.400> think<00:02:12.820> they're<00:02:12.940> all<00:02:13.030> man-made<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.830> the

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
I think they're all man-made and the

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.850 
I think they're all man-made and the
opposite<00:02:15.250> direction<00:02:15.340> is<00:02:15.700> one<00:02:15.880> of<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.030> smaller

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
opposite direction is one of the smaller

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:25.949 
opposite direction is one of the smaller
