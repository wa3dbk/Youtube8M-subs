00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.770
 what music is according to the internet is the 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.990
 art of organizing sensibly and logically 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.940
 a coherent combination of sounds and 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.340
 silences using the principles 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.100
 fundamentals of melody harmony and 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.050
 the rhythm the music is to be 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.410
 enjoyed and listened to for the most 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.050
 of people but for me it is hell 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.419
 because let me explain what from the 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.980
 principle can call frame makes 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.680
 three weeks was a normal person 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.289
 I always got together with my four friends 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.359
 in total we were five until that day one 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:43.640
 from my friends I introduce myself to a person 

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:46.010
 peculiar medium was young and dressed with 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.140
 clothes similar to a pajama hung a 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.539
 violin but what surprised him was 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.659
 that he did not have ears like that is he did not have 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:55.699
 ears but because he had a violin to the 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:57.229
 ask that my friend told him 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.479
 with sign language since they must 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:02.030
 use these signs for people with 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:04.729
 auditory or vocal disability since a 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.830
 He answered the music is synonymous 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.840
 of freedom to play whatever you want and 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.820
 as you want whenever it is flight and 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.409
 have passion that music is the 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.390
 love food 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.270
 I think a life dedicated to music 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.880
 it's a beautifully used life and it's a 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.060
 that to which I have dedicated mine without 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.340
 music life would be a mistake maybe not 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.189
 I can listen but I feel the music in 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.409
 a body responded by signing and me 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:32.060
 He surprised those explanations 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.310
 someone who lost in the ability to 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.049
 to be able to listen to music and apparently 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.869
 liked and became part of our 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.729
 group we did everything the guys in 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.829
 our ages could do during 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:46.039
 almost three weeks I forgot to mention 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:48.319
 I am 15 years old in that period of time 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:50.149
 who will call silo told us that 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:52.520
 I was on vacation and I would have to 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.590
 leave soon all disillusioned in their 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.530
 last day of stay we decided to go to 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.140
 celebrate a bar for all your friendship 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.090
 because we had to go after a little while 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.069
 being in the bar some people came in 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.189
 armed forces threatened by money and 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:09.829
 kill everyone we were scared for their 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:11.720
 pistols all but the thieves 

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:13.849
 they started shooting everywhere and 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.769
 they injured several people all of us 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.260
 numb since it was the first time 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.370
 we saw all but blood of others 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.459
 yes what of some 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.260
 strangely he enjoyed it when he saw 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.569
 I had fun like crazy with a strong 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.409
 change of mood incredibly said with 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:32.870
 his words who they think are 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:35.629
 they think they have power they think they are 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:39.110
 immortal who will never die who will kill 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:41.480
 forever do not make me laugh they're just 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.209
 some immortal human fools full of 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.489
 sins that do not deserve to live in peace but 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.739
 quiet the violin melody will be what 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.780
 only good that surprised me a lot 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.000
 how could it be revealed to 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.340
 them that have those mood swings 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.440
 drastic that your violin will play in this 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.739
 situation but the most shocking that 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.569
 speak without being able to hear his words 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:05.590
 Then he touched the damn melody 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.590
 that I will never forget 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:16.549
 that was the first violin solo solo 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:19.150
 are missing two hehe I see that it is 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:21.950
 affecting them look they are already bleeding 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.470
 it was one of the strangest things that 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.109
 he passed all the people including not 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.170
 they bled through the nose, heard mouth or 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:32.030
 eyes before the desperation of everything 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.819
 what happened I decided to write this letter 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.340
 so that everyone knows what 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:40.370
 will be the next two melodies 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.139
 you will never know I am everything now 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.500
 it is inevitable to hear the second 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:44.500
 melody 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:29.310
 is constitute a dance will be better than 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.980
 what the security camera recorded 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:35.720
 damn host broke the visor I'll have 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.720
 to listen and draw conclusions 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:43.020
 who they think they are they think they have 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:46.500
 they believe they are immortal that they never 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.419
 they will die that they will kill forever I do not 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.879
 make you laugh are just fools 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:53.550
 immortal humans full of sins that 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:55.409
 They do not deserve to live in peace but calm 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.979
 the melody of my violin will be the only 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:57.979
 good 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.840
 that was the first violin solo solo 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.840
 2 missing 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:12.830
 I see that it is already affecting them, look at them 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.830
 are bleeding with this could not 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:19.430
 find out nothing shit what's that 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:22.480
 blood better clean me now let's go with 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.480
 the second melody 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:49.590
 really beautiful because you do not say anything 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:51.780
 it will be because you can not truly move what 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.820
 that the second melody is to inject in a 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.280
 organism a kind of virus that 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:06:00.509
 it prevents moving your body if I already know it sounds 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:03.810
 rare but so what happens I can not move 

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:06.270
 my body what the hell is happening moves 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.850
 this body of mine reacts reacts da 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:11.789
 it's time to listen to the last of the 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:16.220
 melodies the last of the three melodies 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:16.220
 of silence the melody of death 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:41.979
 sergeant sproting you're here but 

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:43.509
