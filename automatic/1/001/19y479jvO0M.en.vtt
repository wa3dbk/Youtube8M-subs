00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
how I can tell if it's like the Poisson

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.440

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
to the test and see no looks like the

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.600 
to the test and see no looks like the
knots<00:01:11.820> or<00:01:12.150> fairly<00:01:13.020> similar<00:01:13.980> they're<00:01:14.280> not<00:01:14.580> a

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
knots or fairly similar they're not a

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.910 
knots or fairly similar they're not a
lot<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.000> difference<00:01:15.510> between<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.470> two<00:01:16.500> and

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
lot of difference between the two and

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.500 
lot of difference between the two and
the<00:01:17.190> thing<00:01:17.370> that<00:01:17.520> makes<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.850> flah<00:01:18.030> Sun<00:01:18.240> not

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 
the thing that makes the flah Sun not

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.420 
the thing that makes the flah Sun not
great<00:01:18.780> in<00:01:18.900> my<00:01:19.020> opinion<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.710> fibers<00:01:20.310> are

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
great in my opinion is the fibers are

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.250 
great in my opinion is the fibers are
very<00:01:20.610> very<00:01:20.820> thin<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:21.510> this<00:01:21.720> one<00:01:21.930> feels

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
very very thin and so this one feels

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.490 
very very thin and so this one feels
very<00:01:22.740> thin<00:01:23.670> it's<00:01:23.880> playing<00:01:24.300> very<00:01:24.630> easy<00:01:25.020> on<00:01:25.230> my

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
very thin it's playing very easy on my

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.590 
very thin it's playing very easy on my
hand<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:26.010> that<00:01:26.190> is<00:01:26.370> an<00:01:26.520> excellent<00:01:26.940> sign<00:01:27.270> so

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
hand so that is an excellent sign so

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.250 
hand so that is an excellent sign so

let's go ahead and wet the face and put

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.960 
let's go ahead and wet the face and put
these<00:02:28.709> guys<00:02:28.890> into<00:02:29.160> action<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:29.700> see<00:02:29.819> what

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
these guys into action and see what

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.970 
these guys into action and see what
happens<00:02:30.330> in<00:02:30.480> Samba<00:02:30.840> all<00:02:31.410> right<00:02:31.560> so<00:02:31.769> let's

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
happens in Samba all right so let's

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.250 
happens in Samba all right so let's
start<00:02:32.099> with<00:02:32.610> oh<00:02:32.849> yeah<00:02:33.060> I<00:02:33.330> can<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:33.750> can<00:02:34.080> tell

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
start with oh yeah I can I can tell

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.160 
start with oh yeah I can I can tell
already<00:02:34.470> this<00:02:35.630> is<00:02:36.630> very<00:02:37.310> similar<00:02:38.310> to<00:02:38.959> the<00:02:39.959> Plus

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
already this is very similar to the Plus

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.640 
already this is very similar to the Plus
on<00:02:40.349> very<00:02:40.890> similar<00:02:41.790> indeed<00:02:41.989> maybe<00:02:42.989> a<00:02:43.200> plus<00:02:43.440> on

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
on very similar indeed maybe a plus on

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.039 
on very similar indeed maybe a plus on
not<00:02:43.890> I<00:02:44.069> do<00:02:44.190> not<00:02:44.580> know<00:02:44.819> but<00:02:45.599> I<00:02:45.660> can<00:02:45.810> tell<00:02:45.989> you

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
right now just based on the way it's

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.820 
right now just based on the way it's
feeling<00:02:48.180> it<00:02:48.750> feels<00:02:48.959> very<00:02:49.049> similar<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.739> the

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
feeling it feels very similar to the

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:57.890 
feeling it feels very similar to the
Poisson<00:02:50.239> yep<00:02:52.069> yeah<00:02:53.069> yep<00:02:55.970> almost<00:02:56.970> identical

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
Poisson yep yeah yep almost identical

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.039 
Poisson yep yeah yep almost identical
and<00:02:58.079> this<00:02:58.620> one<00:02:58.829> it<00:02:58.950> looks<00:02:59.069> a<00:02:59.880> bit<00:02:59.940> smaller<00:03:00.660> than

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
and this one it looks a bit smaller than

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.960 
and this one it looks a bit smaller than
my<00:03:01.530> Poisson<00:03:02.150> not<00:03:03.150> but<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.959> feel<00:03:04.970> extremely

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
my Poisson not but the feel extremely

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.569 
my Poisson not but the feel extremely
soft<00:03:06.840> almost<00:03:07.260> no<00:03:07.650> difference<00:03:08.099> in<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.340> field
