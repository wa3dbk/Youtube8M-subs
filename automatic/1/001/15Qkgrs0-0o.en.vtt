a pool and get to the drive I'd heels
but<00:03:33.360> I<00:03:33.600> guess<00:03:34.260> I<00:03:34.380> could<00:03:34.530> do<00:03:34.590> a<00:03:34.620> series<00:03:34.980> trying

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
but I guess I could do a series trying

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.970 
but I guess I could do a series trying
to<00:03:35.220> find<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:35.640> real<00:03:35.940> Mike<00:03:36.150> Bell<00:03:36.650> so<00:03:37.650> that<00:03:37.829> might

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
to find the real Mike Bell so that might

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.530 
to find the real Mike Bell so that might
take<00:03:38.130> a<00:03:38.190> little<00:03:38.340> while<00:03:38.579> but<00:03:38.910> anyways<00:03:39.239> I<00:03:39.420> hope

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540
