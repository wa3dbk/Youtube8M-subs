with<00:00:00.719> dentures<00:00:00.960> we<00:00:01.350> find<00:00:01.620> that<00:00:01.740> there<00:00:01.979> are

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
with dentures we find that there are

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.949 
with dentures we find that there are
several<00:00:02.909> different<00:00:03.060> things<00:00:03.300> that<00:00:03.689> can<00:00:03.840> be

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
several different things that can be

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.710 
several different things that can be
utilized<00:00:04.110> to<00:00:04.770> help<00:00:04.799> keep<00:00:05.250> a<00:00:05.370> denture<00:00:05.580> clean<00:00:06.000> it

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
utilized to help keep a denture clean it

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.720 
utilized to help keep a denture clean it
is<00:00:06.839> important<00:00:07.230> to<00:00:07.319> emphasize<00:00:07.770> that<00:00:07.799> denture

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
is important to emphasize that denture

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.490 
is important to emphasize that denture
is<00:00:08.790> just<00:00:09.300> like<00:00:09.450> any<00:00:09.660> other<00:00:09.750> material<00:00:10.320> that<00:00:10.349> we

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
is just like any other material that we

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.110 
is just like any other material that we
would<00:00:10.650> put<00:00:10.769> in<00:00:10.830> a<00:00:10.980> mouth<00:00:11.190> such<00:00:11.490> as<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.670> filling

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
would put in a mouth such as a filling

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.660 
would put in a mouth such as a filling
or<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.360> crown<00:00:12.420> or<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:13.080> bridge<00:00:13.410> that<00:00:14.250> they<00:00:14.400> need<00:00:14.580> to

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
or a crown or a bridge that they need to

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.880 
or a crown or a bridge that they need to
be<00:00:14.820> cleaned<00:00:15.179> kind<00:00:15.570> of<00:00:15.630> on<00:00:15.750> an<00:00:15.870> ongoing<00:00:16.049> basis

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
be cleaned kind of on an ongoing basis

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.269 
be cleaned kind of on an ongoing basis
the<00:00:17.550> reason<00:00:17.940> being<00:00:18.119> is<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.359> denture<00:00:18.840> is<00:00:19.109> made<00:00:20.039> of

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
the reason being is a denture is made of

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.820 
the reason being is a denture is made of
basically<00:00:20.990> you<00:00:21.990> know<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.109> hard<00:00:22.439> type<00:00:22.650> of

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
basically you know a hard type of

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.279 
basically you know a hard type of
plastic<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:24.180> plastic<00:00:24.689> is<00:00:24.810> kind<00:00:25.080> of<00:00:25.109> like

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
plastic and that plastic is kind of like

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.990 
plastic and that plastic is kind of like
a<00:00:25.320> sponge<00:00:25.769> when<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.160> look<00:00:26.340> at<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.490> microscopic

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
a sponge when you look at a microscopic

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.630 
a sponge when you look at a microscopic
level<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.779> it's<00:00:27.990> because<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.890> we

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
level and it's because of that that we

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.460 
level and it's because of that that we
find<00:00:29.939> that<00:00:30.179> when<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.570> look<00:00:30.779> at<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.109> that<00:00:31.289> it

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
find that when you look at it that it

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.520 
find that when you look at it that it
can<00:00:31.949> harbor<00:00:32.369> bacteria<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:33.480> fungus<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.260> other

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
can harbor bacteria and fungus and other

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.200 
can harbor bacteria and fungus and other
kinds<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:34.980> things<00:00:35.190> that<00:00:35.370> can<00:00:35.610> collect<00:00:35.820> on<00:00:36.120> the

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
kinds of things that can collect on the

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.270 
kinds of things that can collect on the
inside<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.719> denture<00:00:37.140> so<00:00:37.920> it's<00:00:38.070> very

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
inside of the denture so it's very

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.740 
inside of the denture so it's very
important<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:39.120> keep<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.420> denture

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
important that you keep the denture

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.930 
important that you keep the denture
clean<00:00:40.020> otherwise<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.980> can<00:00:41.219> be<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.340> harbor<00:00:41.790> for

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
clean otherwise it can be a harbor for

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.580 
clean otherwise it can be a harbor for
other<00:00:42.090> sorts<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.480> infection<00:00:43.050> which<00:00:43.290> is

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
other sorts of infection which is

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.440 
other sorts of infection which is
something<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.489> if<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.789> put<00:00:45.000> back<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.360> the

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
something that if you put back in the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.240 
something that if you put back in the
mouth<00:00:45.629> on<00:00:45.840> an<00:00:45.960> ongoing<00:00:46.110> basis<00:00:46.770> can<00:00:46.950> irritate

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
mouth on an ongoing basis can irritate

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.150 
mouth on an ongoing basis can irritate
all<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:47.789> world<00:00:48.000> tissues<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.690> mouth<00:00:49.129> so<00:00:50.129> a

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
all that world tissues in the mouth so a

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.610 
all that world tissues in the mouth so a
question<00:00:50.820> is<00:00:50.969> what<00:00:51.360> type<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:52.020> things<00:00:52.230> can<00:00:52.530> we

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
question is what type of things can we

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.860 
question is what type of things can we
utilize<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:53.460> keep<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.760> denture<00:00:54.090> clean<00:00:54.360> the

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
utilize to keep the denture clean the

as<00:01:25.290> an<00:01:25.409> effort<00:01:25.710> or<00:01:25.830> something<00:01:26.580> like<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:27.049> they

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
as an effort or something like that they

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.230 
as an effort or something like that they
all<00:01:28.200> work<00:01:28.439> around<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.220> same<00:01:29.430> same<00:01:29.759> premise

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
all work around the same same premise

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.020 
all work around the same same premise
that<00:01:30.450> they<00:01:31.020> basically<00:01:31.439> bubble<00:01:32.400> up<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.759> try<00:01:32.970> to

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
that they basically bubble up and try to

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.640 
that they basically bubble up and try to
help<00:01:33.180> dissolve<00:01:33.600> some<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.110> build<00:01:34.350> up<00:01:34.500> that

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
help dissolve some of the build up that
