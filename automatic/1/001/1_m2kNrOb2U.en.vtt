that's it the guy said that not all GPUs
are<00:01:10.320> supported<00:01:11.420> but<00:01:12.420> what<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:12.750> can<00:01:12.900> do<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.320> you

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
are supported but what you can do is you

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.070 
are supported but what you can do is you
can<00:01:14.130> go<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.490> options<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.780> gives<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.049> a

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
can go to options and it gives you a

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.310 
can go to options and it gives you a
blurriness<00:01:16.680> control<00:01:17.580> here<00:01:18.240> so<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.080> can

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
blurriness control here so you can

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.469 
blurriness control here so you can
actually<00:01:19.439> set<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:19.920> down<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.220> like<00:01:20.340> six<00:01:20.970> where

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
actually set it down to like six where

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.469 
actually set it down to like six where
there's<00:01:21.720> like<00:01:22.369> almost<00:01:23.369> nothing<00:01:23.939> like<00:01:24.299> its

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.010 
but didn't seem like it was in freaking
slow<00:02:04.310> motion<00:02:04.730> so<00:02:05.570> I<00:02:05.600> guess<00:02:05.780> you<00:02:05.990> could

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
slow motion so I guess you could

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.690 
slow motion so I guess you could
probably<00:02:06.260> do<00:02:06.470> that<00:02:06.500> but<00:02:06.920> blurriness<00:02:07.340> for<00:02:07.670> a

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
probably do that but blurriness for a

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.460 
probably do that but blurriness for a
hundred<00:02:07.970> don't<00:02:08.270> ever<00:02:08.510> free<00:02:08.990> can<00:02:09.170> do<00:02:09.320> it

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
hundred don't ever free can do it

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.760 
hundred don't ever free can do it
because<00:02:09.860> it's<00:02:10.010> ridonkulous<00:02:10.400> like<00:02:11.770> that's

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
because it's ridonkulous like that's

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.440 
because it's ridonkulous like that's
what<00:02:12.950> happens<00:02:13.310> like<00:02:13.850> I<00:02:13.940> didn't<00:02:14.120> even<00:02:14.180> touch

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
what happens like I didn't even touch

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.880 
what happens like I didn't even touch
the<00:02:14.630> mouse<00:02:14.810> it<00:02:15.110> just<00:02:15.290> like<00:02:15.410> kind<00:02:15.710> of<00:02:15.830> like

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
the mouse it just like kind of like

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.120 
the mouse it just like kind of like
looked<00:02:16.340> and<00:02:16.780> that<00:02:17.780> was<00:02:17.960> it<00:02:18.200> look<00:02:18.440> that<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:18.680> pig

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
looked and that was it look that the pig

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
is gone now I don't even know where the

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.990 
is gone now I don't even know where the

seventy<00:02:43.880> eight<00:02:44.000> would<00:02:44.120> be<00:02:44.180> good<00:02:44.450> if<00:02:44.510> you're<00:02:44.840> if

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
seventy eight would be good if you're if

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.630 
seventy eight would be good if you're if
you<00:02:45.260> want<00:02:45.470> to<00:02:45.530> do<00:02:45.620> like<00:02:45.770> a<00:02:45.830> dream<00:02:46.310> thing

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
because that would actually very cool if

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.540 
because that would actually very cool if
you<00:02:48.230> gave<00:02:48.380> yourself<00:02:48.470> slowness<00:02:49.190> and<00:02:49.310> made<00:02:49.460> it

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
you gave yourself slowness and made it

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
you gave yourself slowness and made it
to<00:02:49.640> where<00:02:49.700> you<00:02:49.760> couldn't<00:02:50.030> see<00:02:50.240> actually<00:02:50.540> a

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
to where you couldn't see actually a

particles<00:02:51.050> and<00:02:51.200> you<00:02:51.890> just<00:02:52.100> walk<00:02:52.400> like<00:02:52.430> this

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
particles and you just walk like this

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.540 
particles and you just walk like this
you<00:02:53.030> just<00:02:53.090> boom<00:02:53.840> let's<00:02:54.560> say<00:02:54.709> can<00:02:54.890> I<00:02:55.010> can<00:02:55.220> I<00:02:55.310> have

you just boom let's say can I can I have
the<00:02:55.700> potion<00:02:56.209> of<00:02:56.420> slowness<00:02:56.720> is<00:02:57.610> there<00:02:58.610> such<00:02:58.790> a

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
the potion of slowness is there such a

thing<00:02:58.910> as<00:02:59.060> pushing<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.510> slowness<00:02:59.780> or<00:03:00.110> is<00:03:00.200> that

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
thing as pushing the slowness or is that

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.180 
thing as pushing the slowness or is that
uh<00:03:00.440> oh<00:03:00.800> yeah<00:03:01.100> there<00:03:01.280> it<00:03:01.370> is<00:03:01.430> check<00:03:01.700> that<00:03:01.850> out<00:03:03.190> so

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
about do an f1 if I can do f1 that's not

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.170 
about do an f1 if I can do f1 that's not
really<00:03:22.190> that<00:03:22.220> slow<00:03:24.670> you<00:03:25.670> can<00:03:25.790> probably<00:03:25.970> like

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
really that slow you can probably like

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.880 
really that slow you can probably like
do<00:03:26.360> some<00:03:26.540> sort<00:03:26.720> of<00:03:26.780> multiplier<00:03:27.290> something<00:03:27.739> by

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
do some sort of multiplier something by

wanna<00:04:22.430> my<00:04:22.640> predicted<00:04:23.420> I'd<00:04:23.510> probably<00:04:23.690> be<00:04:23.870> used

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
wanna my predicted I'd probably be used

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.310 
wanna my predicted I'd probably be used
um<00:04:25.210> it<00:04:26.210> would<00:04:26.360> probably<00:04:26.570> be<00:04:26.750> better<00:04:26.900> suited

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
um it would probably be better suited

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.130 
um it would probably be better suited
when<00:04:28.010> you're<00:04:28.190> doing<00:04:28.660> machinimas<00:04:29.660> and<00:04:29.900> stuff

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
when you're doing machinimas and stuff

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.710 
when you're doing machinimas and stuff
like<00:04:30.290> that<00:04:30.350> as<00:04:30.920> far<00:04:31.430> as<00:04:31.460> gameplay<00:04:31.820> I<00:04:32.420> don't

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
like that as far as gameplay I don't

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.450 
like that as far as gameplay I don't
know<00:04:32.840> if<00:04:32.960> you<00:04:33.050> actually<00:04:33.260> really<00:04:33.980> want<00:04:34.310> it

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
know if you actually really want it

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.970 
know if you actually really want it
because<00:04:35.210> it<00:04:35.480> might<00:04:35.660> make<00:04:35.840> you<00:04:36.020> sick<00:04:36.440> unless

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
because it might make you sick unless

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.450 
because it might make you sick unless
you<00:04:37.190> like<00:04:37.300> seeing<00:04:38.300> the<00:04:38.480> whole<00:04:39.460> everything

it<00:04:42.530> like<00:04:42.680> no<00:04:42.920> really<00:04:43.280> hard<00:04:43.520> edges<00:04:43.790> I<00:04:44.240> guess

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
it like no really hard edges I guess

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.400 
it like no really hard edges I guess
that<00:04:45.200> would<00:04:45.500> be<00:04:45.680> a<00:04:45.710> way<00:04:45.890> to<00:04:45.920> do<00:04:46.190> it<00:04:46.370> but<00:04:46.850> uh<00:04:47.410> yeah
