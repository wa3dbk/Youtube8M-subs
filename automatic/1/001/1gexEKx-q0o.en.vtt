00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
because he did it quick and he didn't

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.770

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
how to do that as well but but you spot

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.000 
how to do that as well but but you spot
climb<00:03:46.540> all<00:03:46.750> the<00:03:47.019> places<00:03:47.290> make<00:03:47.680> sure<00:03:47.829> there's

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
climb all the places make sure there's

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.430 
climb all the places make sure there's
primer<00:03:48.430> over<00:03:48.790> every<00:03:49.389> different<00:03:49.870> every

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
primer over every different every

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.819 
primer over every different every
surface<00:03:50.739> that<00:03:51.040> changes<00:03:51.579> now<00:03:52.269> there's<00:03:52.540> no<00:03:52.840> are

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
surface that changes now there's no are

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:55.620 
surface that changes now there's no are
you<00:03:54.040> not<00:03:54.160> really<00:03:54.489> saying<00:03:54.730> we<00:03:54.970> need<00:03:55.120> to<00:03:55.239> prime

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
you not really saying we need to prime

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.379 
you not really saying we need to prime
everything<00:03:56.350> every<00:03:56.620> time<00:03:56.829> we<00:03:56.980> do<00:03:57.130> this<00:03:57.340> but<00:03:58.000> the

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:58.389 
everything every time we do this but the

00:03:58.389 --> 00:03:59.970 
everything every time we do this but the
point<00:03:58.630> is<00:03:58.720> knowing<00:03:59.109> when<00:03:59.350> to<00:03:59.380> do<00:03:59.620> it<00:03:59.650> or<00:03:59.829> when

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
point is knowing when to do it or when

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.610 
point is knowing when to do it or when
not<00:04:00.160> no<00:04:00.639> way<00:04:00.849> to<00:04:00.910> do<00:04:01.120> it<00:04:01.299> you<00:04:01.690> know<00:04:01.840> because

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
not no way to do it you know because

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.319 
not no way to do it you know because
then<00:04:02.769> you<00:04:02.859> can<00:04:02.980> keep<00:04:03.160> the<00:04:03.310> cost<00:04:03.519> down<00:04:03.700> at<00:04:04.120> least

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
then you can keep the cost down at least

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:06.360 
then you can keep the cost down at least
some<00:04:04.660> right<00:04:05.109> exactly<00:04:05.560> when<00:04:05.829> you<00:04:05.950> do<00:04:06.130> a<00:04:06.160> good
