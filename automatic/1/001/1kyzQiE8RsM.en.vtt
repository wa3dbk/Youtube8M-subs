00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
to fit mine in so what I want to do is

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.189 
to fit mine in so what I want to do is
tell<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.119> little<00:00:27.269> bit<00:00:27.420> about<00:00:27.599> my<00:00:27.930> concept

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
tell you a little bit about my concept

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.620 
tell you a little bit about my concept
and<00:00:28.710> design<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.250> process<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.210> how<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.480> came

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
and design the process and how it came

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.479 
and design the process and how it came
out<00:00:30.840> so<00:00:31.289> let's<00:00:31.890> get<00:00:32.009> started

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
out so let's get started

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.330 
out so let's get started
so<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.300> concept<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:34.410> concept<00:00:34.440> of<00:00:34.980> this<00:00:35.070> mask

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
so the concept the concept of this mask

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.459 
so the concept the concept of this mask
as<00:00:35.579> you<00:00:36.059> can<00:00:36.180> already<00:00:36.390> tell<00:00:36.630> is<00:00:36.989> really

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
as you can already tell is really

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.619 
as you can already tell is really
inspired<00:00:37.920> as<00:00:38.160> I've<00:00:38.520> done<00:00:38.670> before<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.180> course<00:00:39.210> I

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
inspired as I've done before of course I

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.889 
inspired as I've done before of course I
really<00:00:40.200> like<00:00:40.379> that<00:00:40.559> Reena<00:00:40.890> inspired<00:00:41.399> look<00:00:42.000> but

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
really like that Reena inspired look but

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.750 
really like that Reena inspired look but
what<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.020> wanted<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.440> do<00:00:43.590> was<00:00:43.770> personalize<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.730> a

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
what I wanted to do was personalize it a

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.549 
what I wanted to do was personalize it a
little<00:00:44.910> bit<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.300> sort<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.840> do<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.079> little<00:00:46.440> bit

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
little bit and sort of do a little bit

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.160 
little bit and sort of do a little bit
of<00:00:46.649> an<00:00:46.800> ode<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.070> my<00:00:47.309> kids<00:00:47.700> so<00:00:48.120> what<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.450> did<00:00:48.539> was<00:00:48.960> I

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
of an ode to my kids so what I did was I

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.470 
of an ode to my kids so what I did was I
wanted<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.620> get<00:00:49.800> solely<00:00:50.190> from<00:00:50.969> monsters

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
wanted to get solely from monsters

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.209 
wanted to get solely from monsters
incorporated<00:00:51.649> and<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.739> know<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:53.070> probably

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
incorporated and I know it probably

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.580 
incorporated and I know it probably
doesn't<00:00:53.550> look<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.850> whole<00:00:54.059> lot<00:00:54.090> like<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.780> mostly

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
doesn't look a whole lot like it mostly

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.189 
doesn't look a whole lot like it mostly
because<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.489> decisions<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.300> made<00:00:57.600> so

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
because of the decisions that I made so

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.630 
because of the decisions that I made so
for<00:00:58.410> example<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.980> can<00:00:59.100> see<00:00:59.280> in<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.460> back<00:00:59.609> here

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
for example you can see in the back here

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.830 
for example you can see in the back here
my<00:01:00.210> pads<00:01:00.480> are<00:01:00.660> navy<00:01:00.780> blue<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.680> light<00:01:02.039> blue<00:01:02.070> and

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
my pads are navy blue and light blue and

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.830 
my pads are navy blue and light blue and
white<00:01:03.840> so<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.890> didn't<00:01:05.670> want<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.909> have<00:01:06.119> teal<00:01:06.570> or

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
white so I didn't want to have teal or

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.750 
white so I didn't want to have teal or
that<00:01:06.990> turquoise<00:01:07.470> color<00:01:07.799> along<00:01:08.220> with<00:01:08.280> purple

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
that turquoise color along with purple

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.760 
that turquoise color along with purple
spots<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.689> what<00:01:09.780> we<00:01:09.900> did<00:01:10.049> was<00:01:10.200> we<00:01:10.380> took<00:01:10.560> his

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
spots so what we did was we took his

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.760 
spots so what we did was we took his
eyes<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.729> brow<00:01:12.060> Ridge<00:01:12.330> here<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.650> is

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
eyes and the brow Ridge here and that is

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.920 
eyes and the brow Ridge here and that is
straight<00:01:13.979> from<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.250> movie<00:01:14.490> as<00:01:14.640> well<00:01:15.240> as<00:01:15.659> his

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
straight from the movie as well as his

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.960 
straight from the movie as well as his
mouth<00:01:16.200> down<00:01:16.470> here<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.189> his<00:01:17.400> teeth<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.880> way

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
mouth down here and his teeth the way

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.749 
mouth down here and his teeth the way
his<00:01:18.090> teeth<00:01:18.330> are<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.810> as<00:01:19.500> well<00:01:19.680> as<00:01:19.860> his<00:01:20.070> fur<00:01:20.430> a

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
his teeth are and as well as his fur a

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.910 
his teeth are and as well as his fur a
bit<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.540> extends<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.350> back<00:01:22.500> as<00:01:22.710> well

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
bit in that extends to the back as well

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.730 
bit in that extends to the back as well
so<00:01:23.700> there<00:01:24.450> were<00:01:24.600> some<00:01:24.810> areas<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.290> this<00:01:25.439> mask

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
so there were some areas of this mask

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.179 
so there were some areas of this mask
though<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.340> did<00:01:26.610> not<00:01:26.850> get<00:01:27.150> painted<00:01:27.619> and<00:01:28.619> I

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
though that did not get painted and I

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.550 
though that did not get painted and I
was<00:01:29.400> kind<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.670> upset<00:01:29.850> about<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.420> but<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.079> also

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
was kind of upset about that but I also

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.140 
was kind of upset about that but I also
understand<00:01:32.220> from<00:01:32.340> an<00:01:32.460> artistic<00:01:32.729> perspective

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
understand from an artistic perspective

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.480 
understand from an artistic perspective
maybe<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:34.020> wouldn't<00:01:34.320> have<00:01:34.439> worked<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:35.159> for

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
maybe it wouldn't have worked so for

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.789 
maybe it wouldn't have worked so for
example<00:01:35.909> in<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.600> original<00:01:36.990> concept<00:01:37.560> there

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
example in the original concept there

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.560 
example in the original concept there
were<00:01:37.950> Sully's<00:01:38.520> horns<00:01:38.909> up<00:01:39.060> top<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.509> think

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
were Sully's horns up top and I think

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.539 
were Sully's horns up top and I think
that<00:01:39.840> may<00:01:39.990> have<00:01:40.020> completed<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.710> concept<00:01:41.280> more

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
that may have completed the concept more

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.550 
that may have completed the concept more
but<00:01:42.240> maybe<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.600> wouldn't<00:01:42.899> have<00:01:42.990> looked<00:01:43.290> as

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
but maybe it wouldn't have looked as

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.010 
but maybe it wouldn't have looked as
good<00:01:44.420> artistically<00:01:45.420> maybe<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.840> would<00:01:45.960> have

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
good artistically maybe it would have

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.480 
good artistically maybe it would have
looked<00:01:46.140> like<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.350> halo<00:01:46.799> or<00:01:46.979> something<00:01:47.340> like

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
looked like a halo or something like

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.050 
looked like a halo or something like
that<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.240> understand<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.729> another<00:01:50.729> thing

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
that so I understand that another thing

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.270 
that so I understand that another thing
too<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:52.049> would<00:01:52.470> have<00:01:52.560> preferred<00:01:53.009> this

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
too is that I would have preferred this

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.999 
too is that I would have preferred this
area<00:01:53.729> right<00:01:54.210> here<00:01:54.290> you<00:01:55.290> probably<00:01:55.619> can't<00:01:55.799> see

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
area right here you probably can't see

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.940 
area right here you probably can't see
on<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.219> camera<00:01:56.340> but<00:01:56.759> it's<00:01:57.659> black<00:01:57.990> as<00:01:58.380> opposed

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
on the camera but it's black as opposed

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.340 
on the camera but it's black as opposed
to<00:01:59.070> Navy<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.640> really<00:02:00.390> wanted<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:00.780> maybe<00:02:01.049> since

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
to Navy I really wanted that maybe since

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.959 
to Navy I really wanted that maybe since
that<00:02:01.560> would<00:02:01.710> have<00:02:01.799> matched<00:02:02.009> my<00:02:02.159> pads<00:02:02.399> more<00:02:02.700> so

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
that would have matched my pads more so

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.880 
that would have matched my pads more so
that's<00:02:03.119> more<00:02:03.390> black<00:02:03.689> so<00:02:03.960> really<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.619> colors

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
that's more black so really the colors

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.760 
that's more black so really the colors
that<00:02:04.979> this<00:02:05.159> tend<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.520> be<00:02:05.640> more<00:02:05.850> black<00:02:06.750> blue<00:02:07.320> and

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
that this tend to be more black blue and

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.550 
that this tend to be more black blue and
white<00:02:08.099> as<00:02:08.340> opposed<00:02:09.300> to

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
white as opposed to

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.500 
white as opposed to
a<00:02:10.590> lighter<00:02:11.220> blue<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:11.580> white<00:02:12.030> which<00:02:12.330> would

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
a lighter blue and white which would

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.150 
a lighter blue and white which would
change<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.930> direction<00:02:13.200> of<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.650> mask<00:02:13.890> and

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
change the direction of the mask and

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.790 
change the direction of the mask and
sort<00:02:14.700> of<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.819> concept<00:02:15.030> so<00:02:15.690> there<00:02:16.680> were<00:02:16.770> a

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
sort of the concept so there were a

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.229 
sort of the concept so there were a
couple<00:02:16.920> parts<00:02:17.400> on<00:02:17.520> here<00:02:17.670> that<00:02:17.849> I<00:02:17.880> was<00:02:17.970> a<00:02:18.030> little

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
couple parts on here that I was a little

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.540 
couple parts on here that I was a little
bit<00:02:18.390> disappointed<00:02:19.080> with<00:02:19.130> but<00:02:20.130> at<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.340> same

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
bit disappointed with but at the same

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.160 
bit disappointed with but at the same
time<00:02:20.819> I<00:02:20.849> think<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.300> mask<00:02:21.510> actually<00:02:21.720> came<00:02:22.020> out

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
time I think the mask actually came out

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.820 
time I think the mask actually came out
really<00:02:22.349> well

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
really well

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.620 
really well
when<00:02:23.370> I<00:02:23.400> first<00:02:23.670> received<00:02:23.849> it<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.239> was<00:02:24.390> looking
