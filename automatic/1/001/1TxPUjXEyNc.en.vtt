00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:13.019
 Hello everyone, Crown with you today I am 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.289
 I will consider new equipment 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.090
 beta test closed this is the third level 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:19.550
 third term third wave line like 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.380
 whatever 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.170
 removed all previous valley test tanks 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.680
 new start with tips this video will be about 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:33.450
 Advice the next will be on the Germans first 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.890
 soviet line of tanks of five is 34 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.860
 thousand nine hundred forty second 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:42.899
 Release noble turret 34-ki that immediately 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.020
 I note in contrast to the previous tank 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.879
 the second level is the presence of shells 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.530
 a large number of shells if u 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.539
 the previous tank was not allowed here 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.280
 it was not exactly there was not here 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.020
 of this 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.640
 cumulative to basically very weak 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.180
 it is 76 millimeters ie 80 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:06.150
 millimeter breakdown it weakens the German where 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:09.900
 It was 75 My 87 It was from a German to 8 years 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.060
 weak but punch some tanks 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.100
 can cheer 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.140
 although yes itâ€™s better after all this 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.759
 punch your here it just pierces 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:24.900
 great to s and they are good on big 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:27.299
 distances but armor-piercing bullets 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.850
 armor-piercing dull-headed and not 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.670
 the best option for destruction 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.460
 close-range enemy 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.600
 snapper good armor piercing but 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.130
 also falls with your distance no neither 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.250
 explosive something else passes 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.040
 tank through if got hit and if not 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:51.540
 hit a little scattering fragments when 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:54.659
 I try about not only and everything here on my 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.570
 look of course modelka in principle 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.250
 certainly good but a little bit lacking 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.200
 some details after all 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.189
 previous tanks were like riding in mud 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.259
 not too licked too 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.429
 neat model as if well, not quite 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.550
 only from the factory 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.300
 but already all that liked 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.740
 loops or what it is 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.020
 separate color to bottle it recently 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:22.660
 at the front crashed in order to be even 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:25.510
 not painted here welds 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.520
 how lovely darling this darling 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.470
 I will watch the beauty if still have time with 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.890
 work came running so we have further 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:36.600
 the next tank we have is from the first 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:39.520
 weaving unfortunately unfortunately than not 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.650
 perfect armor that and you know that's 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.070
 here will be just in the face mechvodu 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:48.480
 fly all the shells absolutely gun at 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:50.440
 us bagato with just three shells then 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.730
 boring high-explosive shell 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:57.540
 this is an armor-piercing ordinary stupid 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:01.440
 good break very good break 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.790
 that's armor-piercing 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.130
 Sharp heads too kamorny here 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.060
 a large amount of explosive 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.850
 Here this shell will be if punching then 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.230
 just take the enemies to pieces 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.630
 standard suspension is not here to 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.470
 Sorry call artudar that is you 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:23.440
 there is a good site level armor 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:26.260
 120 millimeter hull forehead is just 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.800
 great weaving tower that is essentially 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.530
 affairs 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.209
 of if you consist forehead have very 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.220
 great chance of not breaking through 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.170
 still need to really aim the hatch 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.660
 vyselivat that somehow under the tower to drive 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:41.130
 shells otherwise breaking through will 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:46.560
 unlikely further this art 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:50.620
 sous su-85 is also interesting so done 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:53.739
 external tanks rumpled you on a very memo 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.620
 her part 34 principle she must 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:04:01.209
 take a shower on the same chassis then done 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:02.739
 in fact, before the course we will look like it was 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:06.700
 the conclusion that the rollers are a little bit 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:09.640
 others look very nice too 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.580
 done and george you're too rusty guslya 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:16.150
 a new look but maybe a long ride 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.730
 toga carries all this naturally will 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:24.270
 fly on hit 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:24.270
 so turrets turrets turrets 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:34.590
 cool saw even have a nice 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:35.430
 model to of course triplexes all visible seams 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.480
 curves 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:41.640
 welding hurried brewed quickly 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:48.440
 hurry everything to the front everything to fight 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:50.670
 units confuses the log but somehow I do not know 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.010
 ass looks a little bit probably here 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.960
 still this here and an old TV series 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.540
 log find such fresh freshness 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.750
 sawn sucked so reddish 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.310
 still there in the carriage with her not stripped off 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.260
 here here is not much chicken but that's it 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.390
 such freshness will be just 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.480
 transferred to the front of the bar with so dirty to 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:11.580
 will be just from the battlefield and a piece of wood 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.760
 just put such a super 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:17.850
 model would be complemented and then we have it 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.730
 of course dad whom do you understand whom 2 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:25.080
 152 millimeters 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:29.910
 giant tower just tower first 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:31.580
 modifications with a huge backseat 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.990
 the caterpillar is just a giant tank 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:37.320
 be sure to take a ride now see 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:41.660
 what he is shells 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:45.900
 he is only two not immediately open it 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:47.610
 152 millimeters guys this is death here 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.290
 pumping here only turret I think 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.360
 that won't be very slow speed 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:53.730
 turning the tower vertical angles and 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:57.450
 I look too 10 degrees shorter 

00:05:53.730 --> 00:06:00.300
 per second probably rise 16 degrees 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:02.160
 chickens in the gel drives spruce rotates 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:06.620
 don't know the rate of fire you need 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.620
 watch but this howitzer 36 rounds 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:12.690
 bebashka bebeshko planed it punches 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.340
 150 millimeters paid is just media 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:18.360
 it will just tear to pieces 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:20.160
 enemies and landmine explosives 150 20 try on 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.620
 my land mine should break the abuse 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.480
 also all the tanks here it will be brutal 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.230
 tank 

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.690
 naturally he will have recharge 

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:31.830
 very long and the speed of rotation of the tower 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:34.740
 so is death for comparison here soon 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:35.979
 the side is the same from just as quickly 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:42.340
 okay 

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:48.919
 let them live next tank I look about 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:54.919
 from too welds on the same visible seams 

00:06:48.919 --> 00:07:02.469
 cool is three t-34 85 sample 43 years 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:07:05.560
 gun 80 heel to pretty darling 

00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:10.479
 but the gunner will probably shoot 

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:14.900
 shooter au jardin anti - aircraft machine gun 

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:17.870
 probably to strengthen now too 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:19.759
 pretty all mod is welding . will be 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:23.060
 really fortified just at the factory 

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:27.710
 fast-fast-fast just iron 

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:30.680
 machine and turret armor by the way 90 

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:32.599
 millimeters this damn is not weak 90 

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.520
 millimeters forehead on the other hand can 

00:07:32.599 --> 00:07:36.199
 under the tower here it will be planted 

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.870
 very painful again hatch mehvoda 

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:40.870
 there is for lumbago 

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:46.779
 even watch in battle need to be tested 

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:49.099
 try on the shells that you have 

00:07:46.779 --> 00:07:51.319
 standard ammunition practically that is 

00:07:49.099 --> 00:07:51.800
 safe gun and unethical ammunition 

00:07:51.319 --> 00:07:54.379
 wes 

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.300
 that is, the same 80 heel is absolutely 

00:07:54.379 --> 00:08:00.080
 one to one 

00:07:55.300 --> 00:08:03.589
 only here more better armor and here 

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:05.389
 better speed this makes all the difference such 

00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:06.289
 were Soviet tanchiki next video 

00:08:05.389 --> 00:08:11.139
 will be about germans 

00:08:06.289 --> 00:08:11.139
 waiting and looking further
