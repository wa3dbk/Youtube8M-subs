another card because he's so popular it

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.370 
another card because he's so popular it
has<00:05:02.130> no<00:05:02.460> cards<00:05:02.760> but<00:05:03.330> i<00:05:03.389> also<00:05:03.570> think<00:05:03.900> Ambrose

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
has no cards but i also think Ambrose

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.500 
has no cards but i also think Ambrose
would<00:05:04.530> come<00:05:04.710> in<00:05:04.860> and<00:05:04.979> in<00:05:05.460> my<00:05:05.669> opinion<00:05:05.790> Ambrose

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
would come in and in my opinion Ambrose

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.750 
would come in and in my opinion Ambrose
would<00:05:06.630> win<00:05:06.810> that<00:05:06.960> one<00:05:07.110> but<00:05:08.010> they<00:05:08.280> could<00:05:08.520> shock

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
would win that one but they could shock

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.600 
would win that one but they could shock
me<00:05:09.050> me<00:05:10.050> if<00:05:10.350> it<00:05:10.590> was<00:05:10.740> me<00:05:10.919> and<00:05:11.130> I<00:05:11.430> was<00:05:11.460> thinking

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
me me if it was me and I was thinking
