 there I go there my life goes in pieces 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.830
 minimum and there he left me many things that I've 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.320
 kept with zeal for many years or 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:24.090
 that have been part of my treasure where 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.610
 us or the imagination yo macho guys are you 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.739
 triumphant and he was super off and 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.509
 he told me something he will never forget I did not 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:32.250
 said you know what happens 8 that sometimes the 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.470

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.370

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.550
 are your hands from my hair 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.579
 they support us 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.320
 I had to be still like creating 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.960
 behind a door appears a 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.110
 philosopher gives that quote 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.220
 they had their fears those moments of passing 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.920
 of everything 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.920
 his sense of we are nothing 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.040
 the place of my recreation ' 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.890
 The game feeling 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.149
 what are we doing in which we are 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.149
 stuck in fear
