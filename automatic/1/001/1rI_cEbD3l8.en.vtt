00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.830 

so<00:00:07.520> now<00:00:07.670> you<00:00:07.730> can<00:00:08.000> see<00:00:08.180> right<00:00:08.330> here<00:00:08.389> we<00:00:08.660> have<00:00:08.690> a

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:08.840 
so now you can see right here we have a

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.970 
so now you can see right here we have a
cut<00:00:09.200> between<00:00:09.800> the<00:00:10.309> two<00:00:10.490> shots<00:00:11.590> but<00:00:12.590> instead<00:00:12.920> of

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:12.980 
cut between the two shots but instead of

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.740 
cut between the two shots but instead of
a<00:00:13.190> cut<00:00:13.520> I<00:00:13.790> want<00:00:13.969> to<00:00:14.030> show<00:00:14.209> a<00:00:14.240> little<00:00:14.510> bit<00:00:14.630> of

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 
a cut I want to show a little bit of

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.870 
a cut I want to show a little bit of
passing<00:00:15.290> of<00:00:15.410> time<00:00:15.679> let's<00:00:16.040> let's<00:00:16.340> take<00:00:16.550> a<00:00:16.580> look

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 
passing of time let's let's take a look

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.749 
passing of time let's let's take a look
at<00:00:17.060> how<00:00:17.300> we<00:00:17.360> can<00:00:17.630> do<00:00:17.779> some<00:00:18.050> basic<00:00:18.759> transitions

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:19.759 
at how we can do some basic transitions

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:22.150 
at how we can do some basic transitions
like<00:00:19.910> a<00:00:20.090> cross<00:00:20.509> dissolve<00:00:20.810> if<00:00:21.740> we<00:00:21.920> come<00:00:22.130> over

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
like a cross dissolve if we come over

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.749 
like a cross dissolve if we come over
here<00:00:22.369> to<00:00:22.700> the<00:00:23.270> timeline<00:00:23.960> and<00:00:24.439> you<00:00:25.430> see<00:00:25.640> this

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:25.759 
here to the timeline and you see this

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:27.479 
here to the timeline and you see this
button<00:00:26.180> right<00:00:26.210> here<00:00:26.509> that's<00:00:26.689> called<00:00:26.960> quick

00:00:27.479 --> 00:00:27.489 
button right here that's called quick

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:30.339 
button right here that's called quick
transition<00:00:28.489> if<00:00:28.640> we<00:00:29.149> click<00:00:29.540> on<00:00:29.750> quick

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
transition if we click on quick

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.940 
transition if we click on quick
transition<00:00:31.220> it<00:00:32.090> pops<00:00:32.450> up<00:00:32.720> a<00:00:32.840> dialog<00:00:33.350> box<00:00:33.380> that

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
transition it pops up a dialog box that

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.670 
transition it pops up a dialog box that
asks<00:00:34.520> us<00:00:34.670> hey<00:00:35.360> do<00:00:35.600> we<00:00:35.719> want<00:00:35.960> to<00:00:36.079> add<00:00:36.230> a

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
asks us hey do we want to add a

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.310 
asks us hey do we want to add a
transition<00:00:37.570> so<00:00:38.570> we're<00:00:38.720> going<00:00:38.810> to<00:00:38.870> do<00:00:39.050> there's

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
transition so we're going to do there's

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.740 
transition so we're going to do there's
dissolve<00:00:39.770> we<00:00:40.490> can<00:00:40.640> do<00:00:40.760> a<00:00:40.790> film<00:00:41.150> dissolve<00:00:41.570> a

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
dissolve we can do a film dissolve a

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.710 
dissolve we can do a film dissolve a
film<00:00:42.050> fade<00:00:42.380> fade<00:00:42.830> to<00:00:43.070> color<00:00:43.480> you<00:00:44.480> should

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 
film fade fade to color you should

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.640 
film fade fade to color you should
experiment<00:00:45.200> with<00:00:45.410> these<00:00:45.590> different

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650 
experiment with these different

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.500 
experiment with these different
transitions<00:00:46.640> so<00:00:46.760> you<00:00:46.850> can<00:00:47.000> see<00:00:47.210> what<00:00:47.360> they

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
transitions so you can see what they

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.680 
transitions so you can see what they
look<00:00:47.540> like<00:00:48.190> notice<00:00:49.190> the<00:00:49.400> position<00:00:49.550> of<00:00:50.210> the

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
look like notice the position of the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.960 
look like notice the position of the
transition<00:00:51.440> we<00:00:51.650> can<00:00:51.860> do<00:00:52.010> it<00:00:52.190> centered<00:00:52.700> on<00:00:52.820> the

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
transition we can do it centered on the

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.990 
transition we can do it centered on the
cut<00:00:53.240> which<00:00:53.570> is<00:00:53.720> what<00:00:53.930> we<00:00:54.110> want<00:00:54.380> for<00:00:54.650> right<00:00:54.800> now

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
cut which is what we want for right now

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.460 
cut which is what we want for right now
but<00:00:56.000> we<00:00:56.090> can<00:00:56.270> also<00:00:56.480> do<00:00:56.840> the<00:00:56.960> transition

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.470 
but we can also do the transition

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.670 
but we can also do the transition
starting<00:00:58.370> at<00:00:58.550> the<00:00:58.970> cut<00:00:59.210> ending<00:00:59.900> or<00:01:00.170> we<00:01:00.530> could

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
starting at the cut ending or we could

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.550 
starting at the cut ending or we could
do<00:01:00.829> a<00:01:00.860> custom<00:01:01.550> transition<00:01:02.239> for<00:01:03.170> right<00:01:03.350> now

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:03.560 
do a custom transition for right now

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.280 
do a custom transition for right now
let's<00:01:03.829> just<00:01:03.920> do<00:01:04.250> centered<00:01:05.030> on<00:01:05.210> the<00:01:05.360> cut<00:01:05.570> and<00:01:05.840> it

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
let's just do centered on the cut and it

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.749 
let's just do centered on the cut and it
kind<00:01:06.470> of<00:01:06.530> shows<00:01:06.799> you<00:01:07.009> a<00:01:07.040> picture<00:01:07.369> of<00:01:07.610> it<00:01:07.729> right

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
kind of shows you a picture of it right

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.680 
kind of shows you a picture of it right
here<00:01:08.290> so<00:01:09.290> now<00:01:09.439> we<00:01:09.500> can<00:01:09.950> do<00:01:10.100> an<00:01:10.220> ad<00:01:10.520> or<00:01:10.880> an<00:01:11.150> ad<00:01:11.420> and

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
here so now we can do an ad or an ad and

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.260 
here so now we can do an ad or an ad and
render<00:01:12.260> which<00:01:12.920> I<00:01:13.190> recommend<00:01:13.430> you<00:01:13.760> just<00:01:14.000> do<00:01:14.150> the

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
render which I recommend you just do the

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.450 
render which I recommend you just do the
ad<00:01:14.450> and<00:01:14.840> render<00:01:15.320> and<00:01:15.530> here<00:01:15.890> we<00:01:15.979> go<00:01:16.100> I'll<00:01:16.340> go

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
ad and render and here we go I'll go

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.670 
ad and render and here we go I'll go
ahead<00:01:16.520> and<00:01:16.670> click<00:01:16.760> on<00:01:16.909> add<00:01:17.090> and<00:01:17.270> render<00:01:17.680> then

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
ahead and click on add and render then

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.440 
ahead and click on add and render then
you<00:01:18.860> can<00:01:18.979> see<00:01:19.159> that<00:01:19.310> it<00:01:19.400> adds<00:01:19.550> the<00:01:19.850> transition

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
you can see that it adds the transition

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.399 
you can see that it adds the transition
and<00:01:20.630> it<00:01:20.720> renders<00:01:21.050> it

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
and it renders it

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.740 
and it renders it
there's<00:01:21.740> the<00:01:21.950> transition<00:01:22.549> icon<00:01:22.729> you<00:01:23.330> can<00:01:23.479> see

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
there's the transition icon you can see

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.469 
there's the transition icon you can see
the<00:01:23.870> little<00:01:24.020> fade<00:01:24.380> line<00:01:24.650> through<00:01:25.120> so<00:01:26.120> now<00:01:26.299> when

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
the little fade line through so now when

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.510 
the little fade line through so now when
I<00:01:26.510> click<00:01:26.630> down<00:01:27.049> here<00:01:27.110> and<00:01:27.380> the<00:01:27.560> timecode<00:01:28.070> ruler

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
I click down here and the timecode ruler

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.700 
I click down here and the timecode ruler
with<00:01:29.120> my<00:01:29.299> cursor<00:01:29.750> I<00:01:29.780> can<00:01:30.020> kind<00:01:30.200> of<00:01:30.290> scrub

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
with my cursor I can kind of scrub

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.130 
with my cursor I can kind of scrub
through<00:01:30.950> and<00:01:31.430> we<00:01:31.940> can<00:01:32.090> take<00:01:32.270> a<00:01:32.330> look<00:01:32.750> at<00:01:32.960> the

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
through and we can take a look at the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.050 
through and we can take a look at the
transition<00:01:33.740> I'll<00:01:33.860> backup<00:01:34.250> the<00:01:34.370> playhead<00:01:34.790> I'll

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
transition I'll backup the playhead I'll

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.630 
transition I'll backup the playhead I'll
push<00:01:35.299> play<00:01:35.659> and<00:01:36.020> let's<00:01:36.860> take<00:01:37.040> a<00:01:37.100> look<00:01:37.369> at<00:01:37.490> this

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
push play and let's take a look at this

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.020 
push play and let's take a look at this
basic<00:01:38.200> cross<00:01:39.200> dissolve<00:01:39.680> showing<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:40.460> passing

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
basic cross dissolve showing the passing

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.740 
basic cross dissolve showing the passing
of<00:01:41.180> time<00:01:42.190> so<00:01:43.190> let's<00:01:43.430> say<00:01:43.640> for<00:01:43.670> whatever<00:01:44.030> reason

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
of time so let's say for whatever reason

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.910 
of time so let's say for whatever reason
if<00:01:44.930> we<00:01:44.960> wanted<00:01:45.590> to<00:01:45.830> remove<00:01:46.640> this<00:01:47.030> transition

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
if we wanted to remove this transition

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.260 
if we wanted to remove this transition
and<00:01:48.920> we<00:01:49.040> wanted<00:01:49.310> to<00:01:49.369> try<00:01:49.670> a<00:01:49.700> different

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
and we wanted to try a different

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.420 
and we wanted to try a different
transition<00:01:50.689> I'm<00:01:51.590> going<00:01:51.799> to<00:01:51.860> put<00:01:51.979> the<00:01:52.100> playhead

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
transition I'm going to put the playhead

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.390 
transition I'm going to put the playhead
right<00:01:52.970> here<00:01:53.180> somewhere<00:01:53.659> near<00:01:54.170> the<00:01:54.710> transition

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
right here somewhere near the transition

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.800 
right here somewhere near the transition
or<00:01:55.580> remember<00:01:55.970> if<00:01:56.060> I'll<00:01:56.180> hold<00:01:56.330> down<00:01:56.510> command

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
or remember if I'll hold down command

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.469 
or remember if I'll hold down command
and<00:01:57.320> click<00:01:57.680> it<00:01:58.250> puts<00:01:58.549> the<00:01:58.729> playhead<00:01:59.150> right

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
and click it puts the playhead right

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.320 
and click it puts the playhead right
there<00:01:59.720> on<00:02:00.260> the<00:02:00.590> transition<00:02:01.159> and<00:02:01.369> you<00:02:01.400> come<00:02:02.180> up

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
there on the transition and you come up

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.840 
there on the transition and you come up
here<00:02:02.570> and<00:02:02.630> you<00:02:02.930> see<00:02:03.170> this<00:02:03.350> like<00:02:03.680> say<00:02:04.130> no<00:02:04.430> or

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
here and you see this like say no or

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.499 
here and you see this like say no or
stop<00:02:05.080> symbol<00:02:06.080> that's<00:02:06.680> called<00:02:07.040> remove<00:02:07.729> effect

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
stop symbol that's called remove effect

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.410 
stop symbol that's called remove effect
so<00:02:09.439> I'll<00:02:09.590> click<00:02:09.860> on<00:02:10.069> the<00:02:10.340> remove<00:02:10.700> effect<00:02:11.120> and

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
so I'll click on the remove effect and

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.190 
so I'll click on the remove effect and
you<00:02:11.930> can<00:02:11.959> see<00:02:12.319> that<00:02:12.500> now<00:02:12.709> it

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
you can see that now it

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.460 
you can see that now it
has<00:02:13.349> been<00:02:13.770> removed<00:02:14.250> so<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.780> playhead<00:02:16.260> or

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
has been removed so the the playhead or

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.020 
has been removed so the the playhead or
the<00:02:16.560> position<00:02:16.980> indicator<00:02:17.129> is<00:02:17.550> still<00:02:17.790> on<00:02:17.940> the

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
the position indicator is still on the

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.660 
the position indicator is still on the
cut<00:02:18.239> I'll<00:02:18.870> go<00:02:19.080> back<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.440> click<00:02:19.680> on<00:02:19.890> quick

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
cut I'll go back and click on quick

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.320 
cut I'll go back and click on quick
transition<00:02:21.510> which<00:02:22.500> really<00:02:22.830> just<00:02:22.950> applies<00:02:23.430> to

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
transition which really just applies to

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.119 
transition which really just applies to
these<00:02:24.540> particular<00:02:24.959> transitions<00:02:25.769> this<00:02:25.920> time

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
these particular transitions this time

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.500 
these particular transitions this time
I'll<00:02:26.310> do<00:02:26.519> a<00:02:26.550> fade<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.629> color<00:02:27.959> and<00:02:29.239> we'll<00:02:30.239> add

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
I'll do a fade to color and we'll add

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.210 
I'll do a fade to color and we'll add
this<00:02:30.959> particular<00:02:31.290> transition<00:02:31.890> we'll<00:02:32.010> do<00:02:32.099> an

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
this particular transition we'll do an

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.199 
this particular transition we'll do an
ADD<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:32.580> render<00:02:33.050> and<00:02:34.370> by<00:02:35.370> default<00:02:35.610> it's<00:02:36.120> going

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
ADD and render and by default it's going

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.610 
ADD and render and by default it's going
to<00:02:36.360> be<00:02:36.450> black<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:36.780> you<00:02:37.110> can<00:02:37.170> see<00:02:37.260> that<00:02:37.500> it's

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
to be black and you can see that it's

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.729 
to be black and you can see that it's
almost<00:02:37.739> like<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.120> jump<00:02:39.120> cut<00:02:39.590> after<00:02:40.590> this

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
almost like a jump cut after this

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.940 
almost like a jump cut after this
particular<00:02:41.040> transition<00:02:41.730> so<00:02:42.120> let's<00:02:42.950> let's

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
particular transition so let's let's

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.920 
particular transition so let's let's
edit<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.640> transition<00:02:45.330> now<00:02:45.510> this<00:02:45.810> is

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
edit the transition now this is

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.050 
edit the transition now this is
something<00:02:46.140> new<00:02:46.530> inside<00:02:47.400> of<00:02:47.549> Abbott<00:02:47.880> that<00:02:47.970> we

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
something new inside of Abbott that we

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.400 
something new inside of Abbott that we
haven't<00:02:48.299> talked<00:02:48.540> about<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:48.959> this<00:02:49.049> is<00:02:49.170> our

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
haven't talked about and this is our

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.100 
haven't talked about and this is our
effects<00:02:49.890> controls<00:02:50.489> so<00:02:51.329> once<00:02:51.630> again<00:02:51.900> if<00:02:52.079> the

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
effects controls so once again if the

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.530 
effects controls so once again if the
playhead<00:02:52.680> or<00:02:52.829> the<00:02:52.920> position<00:02:53.220> indicator<00:02:53.579> is<00:02:54.209> on

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
playhead or the position indicator is on

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.069 
playhead or the position indicator is on
or<00:02:54.810> near<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.790> transition<00:02:56.790> and<00:02:57.060> we<00:02:57.840> come<00:02:58.049> over

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
or near the transition and we come over

00:02:58.079 --> 00:02:59.479 
or near the transition and we come over
here<00:02:58.260> and<00:02:58.410> we<00:02:58.560> click<00:02:58.799> on<00:02:59.010> what's<00:02:59.250> called

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
here and we click on what's called

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.270 
here and we click on what's called
effect<00:03:00.060> mode<00:03:00.360> it's<00:03:01.200> going<00:03:01.440> to<00:03:01.500> open<00:03:01.860> up<00:03:02.040> our

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
effect mode it's going to open up our

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.120 
effect mode it's going to open up our
effect<00:03:03.120> editor<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:03.840> this<00:03:04.500> is<00:03:04.650> where<00:03:04.829> we<00:03:04.980> could

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
effect editor and this is where we could

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.330 
effect editor and this is where we could
actually<00:03:05.190> choose<00:03:05.910> a<00:03:06.209> background<00:03:06.599> color<00:03:07.340> for

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
actually choose a background color for

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.780 
actually choose a background color for
the<00:03:08.640> transition<00:03:09.329> if<00:03:09.540> I<00:03:09.660> click<00:03:10.069> here<00:03:11.069> on<00:03:11.220> this

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
the transition if I click here on this

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.210 
the transition if I click here on this
icon<00:03:12.329> like<00:03:12.870> for<00:03:13.019> example<00:03:13.410> if<00:03:13.470> I<00:03:13.560> want<00:03:13.829> this<00:03:13.980> to

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
icon like for example if I want this to

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.349 
icon like for example if I want this to
be<00:03:14.250> a<00:03:14.400> dip<00:03:14.910> to<00:03:15.329> white<00:03:15.930> transition<00:03:16.910> and<00:03:17.910> I<00:03:18.000> can

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
be a dip to white transition and I can

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:21.110 
be a dip to white transition and I can
change<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:18.870> color<00:03:19.079> here<00:03:19.220> we<00:03:20.220> also<00:03:20.430> have<00:03:20.639> the

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
change the color here we also have the

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.580 
change the color here we also have the
level<00:03:21.569> on<00:03:21.840> this<00:03:22.620> particular<00:03:22.980> transition<00:03:23.850> and

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
level on this particular transition and

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.080 
level on this particular transition and
now<00:03:25.590> when<00:03:25.769> we<00:03:25.829> come<00:03:26.100> back<00:03:26.280> and<00:03:26.609> we<00:03:26.700> scrub

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
now when we come back and we scrub

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.870 
now when we come back and we scrub
through<00:03:27.530> you<00:03:28.530> can<00:03:28.680> see<00:03:28.950> that<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.280> transition

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
through you can see that the transition

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.539 
through you can see that the transition
color<00:03:30.480> changes<00:03:31.230> so<00:03:31.799> we're<00:03:32.280> going<00:03:32.370> to<00:03:32.459> be

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
color changes so we're going to be

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.849 
color changes so we're going to be
talking<00:03:32.790> about<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.239> effects<00:03:33.630> controls<00:03:34.170> and

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
talking about the effects controls and

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.759 
talking about the effects controls and
the<00:03:35.040> effect<00:03:35.400> mode<00:03:35.670> quite<00:03:36.239> a<00:03:36.269> bit<00:03:36.569> in<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:37.350> avid

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
the effect mode quite a bit in the avid

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.830 
the effect mode quite a bit in the avid
throughout<00:03:38.160> these<00:03:38.340> tutorial<00:03:39.299> videos<00:03:39.660> so<00:03:39.780> I'm

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
throughout these tutorial videos so I'm

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.539 
throughout these tutorial videos so I'm
just<00:03:39.959> going<00:03:40.139> to<00:03:40.170> put<00:03:40.709> the<00:03:40.829> playhead<00:03:41.100> of<00:03:41.459> the

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
just going to put the playhead of the

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.190 
just going to put the playhead of the
position<00:03:41.970> indicator<00:03:42.150> back<00:03:42.720> over<00:03:43.079> the

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
position indicator back over the

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.099 
position indicator back over the
transition<00:03:43.620> and<00:03:44.069> I<00:03:45.000> will<00:03:45.180> click<00:03:45.480> on<00:03:45.720> the

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
transition and I will click on the

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.430 
transition and I will click on the
remove<00:03:46.590> effect<00:03:47.299> okay<00:03:48.299> so<00:03:48.359> that's<00:03:48.690> how<00:03:49.260> we<00:03:49.319> use

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
remove effect okay so that's how we use

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.539 
remove effect okay so that's how we use
like<00:03:49.829> a<00:03:49.859> basic<00:03:50.660> dissolve<00:03:51.660> inside<00:03:52.319> of<00:03:52.560> avid<00:03:53.010> but

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
like a basic dissolve inside of avid but

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.180 
like a basic dissolve inside of avid but
what<00:03:53.730> if<00:03:53.819> we<00:03:53.910> want<00:03:54.150> to<00:03:54.209> use<00:03:54.450> different

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
what if we want to use different

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.220 
what if we want to use different
transitions<00:03:56.239> so<00:03:57.239> we're<00:03:57.630> going<00:03:57.720> to<00:03:57.780> go<00:03:57.959> back<00:03:58.200> to

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
transitions so we're going to go back to

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.490 
transitions so we're going to go back to
our<00:03:59.000> effect<00:04:00.000> mode<00:04:00.480> again<00:04:00.870> let's<00:04:01.139> go<00:04:01.290> ahead<00:04:01.349> and

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
our effect mode again let's go ahead and

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.210 
our effect mode again let's go ahead and
just<00:04:01.620> kind<00:04:01.799> of<00:04:01.829> have<00:04:02.010> this<00:04:02.190> window<00:04:02.639> open<00:04:03.180> and

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
just kind of have this window open and

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.800 
just kind of have this window open and
then<00:04:05.220> if<00:04:05.340> we<00:04:05.459> go<00:04:05.609> over<00:04:05.790> here<00:04:05.819> to<00:04:06.209> our<00:04:06.239> actual

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
then if we go over here to our actual

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.289 
then if we go over here to our actual
project<00:04:07.380> window<00:04:07.829> and<00:04:07.859> let<00:04:08.790> me<00:04:08.849> just<00:04:09.030> stretch

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
project window and let me just stretch

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:10.520 
project window and let me just stretch
this<00:04:09.480> out<00:04:09.660> a<00:04:09.720> little<00:04:09.840> bit<00:04:09.989> so<00:04:10.079> that<00:04:10.230> you<00:04:10.349> can

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
this out a little bit so that you can

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.280 
this out a little bit so that you can
see<00:04:10.769> it<00:04:10.859> better<00:04:11.060> notice<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.239> little<00:04:12.450> magenta

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
see it better notice the little magenta

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.449 
see it better notice the little magenta
or<00:04:13.590> purple<00:04:14.099> icon<00:04:14.340> if<00:04:15.269> we<00:04:15.480> click<00:04:15.750> on<00:04:15.780> this<00:04:16.109> icon

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
or purple icon if we click on this icon

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.879 
or purple icon if we click on this icon
you<00:04:17.459> can<00:04:17.609> see<00:04:17.910> this<00:04:18.510> is<00:04:18.720> where<00:04:18.900> we<00:04:19.049> access<00:04:19.650> all

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
you can see this is where we access all

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.430 
you can see this is where we access all
of<00:04:20.130> our<00:04:20.250> different<00:04:20.729> picture<00:04:21.209> and<00:04:21.450> audio

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
of our different picture and audio

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.399 
of our different picture and audio
effects<00:04:22.890> for<00:04:23.130> avid<00:04:23.580> media<00:04:23.849> composer<00:04:24.260> so<00:04:25.260> for

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:25.409 
effects for avid media composer so for

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:26.660 
effects for avid media composer so for
example<00:04:25.830> you<00:04:26.400> know

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
example you know

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.730 
example you know
blend<00:04:27.180> here<00:04:27.870> are<00:04:28.020> different<00:04:28.350> types<00:04:28.560> of

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
blend here are different types of

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.830 
blend here are different types of
transitions<00:04:28.980> that<00:04:29.520> we<00:04:29.730> can<00:04:29.910> use<00:04:30.270> there's<00:04:30.660> the

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
transitions that we can use there's the

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.520 
transitions that we can use there's the
box<00:04:31.140> wipe<00:04:31.640> different<00:04:32.640> masks<00:04:33.390> that<00:04:33.900> we<00:04:34.050> can<00:04:34.230> use

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
box wipe different masks that we can use

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.610 
box wipe different masks that we can use
here's<00:04:34.890> like<00:04:35.010> a<00:04:35.070> page<00:04:35.490> peel<00:04:35.970> transition<00:04:36.960> so<00:04:37.530> if

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
here's like a page peel transition so if

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.680 
here's like a page peel transition so if
I<00:04:37.680> want<00:04:37.890> to<00:04:37.950> use<00:04:38.130> say<00:04:38.310> a<00:04:38.340> page<00:04:38.730> peel<00:04:39.060> transition

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
I want to use say a page peel transition

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.720 
I want to use say a page peel transition
for<00:04:39.870> whatever<00:04:40.050> reason<00:04:40.590> will<00:04:40.740> select<00:04:41.130> peel

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
for whatever reason will select peel

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.570 
for whatever reason will select peel
here's<00:04:42.390> bottom<00:04:43.290> left-hand<00:04:43.680> corner<00:04:43.860> I'll<00:04:44.310> grab

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
here's bottom left-hand corner I'll grab

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.880 
here's bottom left-hand corner I'll grab
the<00:04:44.820> effect<00:04:45.180> I'll<00:04:45.480> drag<00:04:46.110> and<00:04:46.320> drop<00:04:46.560> it<00:04:46.770> onto

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
the effect I'll drag and drop it onto

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.790 
the effect I'll drag and drop it onto
the<00:04:47.250> cut<00:04:47.550> and<00:04:47.850> then<00:04:48.720> when<00:04:48.900> I<00:04:48.930> scrub<00:04:49.560> through

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
the cut and then when I scrub through

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.650 
the cut and then when I scrub through
here<00:04:49.890> you<00:04:50.820> can<00:04:51.030> see<00:04:51.300> the<00:04:51.510> page<00:04:51.780> peel<00:04:53.660> same

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
here you can see the page peel same

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.380 
here you can see the page peel same
thing<00:04:54.870> again<00:04:55.110> if<00:04:55.290> I<00:04:55.380> want<00:04:55.590> to<00:04:55.680> modify<00:04:56.250> this

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
thing again if I want to modify this

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.270 
thing again if I want to modify this
transition<00:04:57.390> we<00:04:58.140> need<00:04:58.290> to<00:04:58.380> have<00:04:58.590> our<00:04:58.620> effects

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
transition we need to have our effects

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.100 
transition we need to have our effects
control<00:04:59.820> or<00:05:00.120> effect<00:05:00.420> mode<00:05:00.690> palette<00:05:01.140> up<00:05:01.730> and

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
control or effect mode palette up and

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.990 
control or effect mode palette up and
you<00:05:04.110> can<00:05:04.260> see<00:05:04.530> here<00:05:05.310> is<00:05:05.490> the<00:05:05.730> particular

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
you can see here is the particular

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.940 
you can see here is the particular
transition<00:05:06.390> and<00:05:07.020> some<00:05:07.290> effects<00:05:07.770> of

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
transition and some effects of

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.830 
transition and some effects of
transitions<00:05:08.550> give<00:05:08.880> you<00:05:09.000> more<00:05:09.210> options<00:05:09.450> than

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
transitions give you more options than

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.560 
transitions give you more options than
others<00:05:10.200> but<00:05:10.950> if<00:05:11.070> I<00:05:11.190> twirl<00:05:11.550> down<00:05:11.820> the<00:05:11.880> border

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
others but if I twirl down the border

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.380 
others but if I twirl down the border
you<00:05:13.350> can<00:05:13.380> see<00:05:13.830> that<00:05:14.070> we<00:05:14.220> could<00:05:14.460> soften<00:05:15.210> the

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
you can see that we could soften the

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.190 
you can see that we could soften the
edge<00:05:15.570> of<00:05:16.140> the<00:05:16.860> transition<00:05:17.610> there's<00:05:18.030> the<00:05:18.330> you

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
edge of the transition there's the you

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.380 
edge of the transition there's the you
know<00:05:19.320> the<00:05:19.620> width<00:05:19.920> of<00:05:20.100> the<00:05:20.220> transition<00:05:20.940> we

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:21.390 
know the width of the transition we

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.440 
know the width of the transition we
could<00:05:21.600> swap<00:05:22.200> the<00:05:22.500> sources<00:05:23.160> you<00:05:23.970> know<00:05:24.060> this<00:05:24.300> is

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
could swap the sources you know this is

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.480 
could swap the sources you know this is
where<00:05:24.690> we<00:05:24.930> can<00:05:25.110> go<00:05:25.410> in<00:05:25.440> and<00:05:25.860> we<00:05:25.980> have<00:05:26.160> more

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
where we can go in and we have more

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.840 
where we can go in and we have more
options<00:05:26.900> with<00:05:27.900> the<00:05:28.050> transition<00:05:28.800> and<00:05:29.010> we<00:05:29.700> can

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
options with the transition and we can

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.080 
options with the transition and we can
also<00:05:30.120> use<00:05:30.660> what<00:05:30.930> are<00:05:30.960> called<00:05:31.130> keyframes<00:05:32.130> to

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
also use what are called keyframes to

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.960 
also use what are called keyframes to
animate<00:05:33.600> changes<00:05:34.230> over<00:05:34.680> time<00:05:34.980> and<00:05:35.400> we'll

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 
animate changes over time and we'll

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.790 
animate changes over time and we'll
definitely<00:05:36.210> have<00:05:36.600> a<00:05:36.930> special<00:05:37.590> tutorial

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
definitely have a special tutorial

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.390 
definitely have a special tutorial
segment<00:05:38.790> for<00:05:39.540> keyframes<00:05:40.350> okay<00:05:41.040> so<00:05:41.100> I<00:05:41.220> just

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
segment for keyframes okay so I just

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.280 
segment for keyframes okay so I just
want<00:05:41.580> to<00:05:41.640> make<00:05:41.730> you<00:05:41.790> aware<00:05:41.970> that<00:05:42.210> there<00:05:42.600> are<00:05:43.200> a

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.290 
want to make you aware that there are a

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.220 
want to make you aware that there are a
lot<00:05:43.560> more<00:05:43.590> transitions<00:05:44.550> inside<00:05:45.480> avid<00:05:46.020> and

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:46.230 
lot more transitions inside avid and

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.470 
lot more transitions inside avid and
some<00:05:46.830> of<00:05:46.950> the<00:05:47.010> transitions<00:05:47.640> allow<00:05:48.030> us<00:05:48.300> to

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:48.480 
some of the transitions allow us to

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.170 
some of the transitions allow us to
manipulate<00:05:49.110> and<00:05:49.380> change<00:05:49.730> them<00:05:50.730> so<00:05:50.760> I'm<00:05:51.060> just

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
manipulate and change them so I'm just

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.720 
manipulate and change them so I'm just
going<00:05:51.330> to<00:05:51.360> close<00:05:51.630> out<00:05:51.900> of<00:05:51.930> the<00:05:52.080> effect<00:05:52.410> editor

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:52.730 
going to close out of the effect editor

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.010 
going to close out of the effect editor
I'm<00:05:53.730> going<00:05:53.880> to<00:05:53.940> go<00:05:54.030> down<00:05:54.210> here<00:05:54.240> and<00:05:54.450> just<00:05:54.840> go

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
I'm going to go down here and just go

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.310 
I'm going to go down here and just go
ahead<00:05:55.140> and<00:05:55.590> remove<00:05:56.100> the<00:05:56.720> transition<00:05:57.720> again

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:58.320 
ahead and remove the transition again

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.800 
ahead and remove the transition again
all<00:05:59.070> right<00:05:59.220> so<00:05:59.400> we'll<00:05:59.580> come<00:05:59.790> back<00:06:00.030> in<00:06:00.330> another

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810 
all right so we'll come back in another
