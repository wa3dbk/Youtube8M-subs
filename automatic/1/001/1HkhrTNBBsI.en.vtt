blend<00:02:55.170> for<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.470> fire<00:02:55.680> you<00:02:55.860> want<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.130> point<00:02:56.310> up

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.630 

so<00:03:00.900> you<00:03:00.990> get<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.260> effect<00:03:01.590> of<00:03:02.250> it<00:03:02.490> being

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
so you get the effect of it being

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.710 
so you get the effect of it being
looking<00:03:03.000> like<00:03:03.150> real<00:03:03.390> fire<00:03:04.040> now<00:03:05.540> with<00:03:06.540> the

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
looking like real fire now with the

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.000 
looking like real fire now with the
candle<00:03:07.080> part<00:03:07.260> we<00:03:07.440> don't<00:03:07.590> have<00:03:07.740> to<00:03:07.890> necessarily

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
candle part we don't have to necessarily

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.480 
candle part we don't have to necessarily
go<00:03:08.370> up<00:03:08.640> we<00:03:08.790> just<00:03:09.000> blend<00:03:09.510> everything<00:03:09.630> together

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.690 

my<00:03:14.490> colors<00:03:14.910> to<00:03:15.000> really<00:03:15.630> make<00:03:15.840> it<00:03:15.870> look<00:03:16.080> like

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
my colors to really make it look like

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:31.490 
my colors to really make it look like
this<00:03:17.700> is<00:03:17.940> a<00:03:17.970> candle<00:03:18.540> whose<00:03:19.080> top<00:03:19.380> is<00:03:19.410> lighter

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.930 

okay<00:03:32.500> that's<00:03:32.710> pretty<00:03:32.950> cool<00:03:33.130> now<00:03:33.310> much<00:03:33.730> of<00:03:33.850> you

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
were asking me about wax dripping so you

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.990 
were asking me about wax dripping so you
want<00:03:39.940> to<00:03:40.030> make<00:03:40.150> the<00:03:40.300> top<00:03:40.480> uneven<00:03:41.190> and<00:03:42.190> then

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
want to make the top uneven and then

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.450 
want to make the top uneven and then
bring<00:03:43.390> the<00:03:43.480> line<00:03:43.720> down<00:03:44.260> alongside<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:44.860> candle

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:45.460 
bring the line down alongside the candle

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.880

and<00:03:45.730> make<00:03:45.910> like<00:03:46.150> a<00:03:46.180> blob<00:03:46.680> okay

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
and make like a blob okay

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.230

let's<00:03:48.730> do<00:03:49.000> that<00:03:49.150> over<00:03:49.420> here<00:03:49.450> and<00:03:49.720> make<00:03:49.810> a<00:03:49.840> blob

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
let's do that over here and make a blob

00:03:51.240 --> 00:04:07.880 
let's do that over here and make a blob
think<00:03:52.240> of<00:03:52.390> lava<00:03:52.600> now<00:03:53.020> and<00:03:53.830> blend<00:03:54.100> it

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:13.430 

oops

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.949 

okay<00:04:14.070> that's<00:04:14.340> pretty<00:04:14.490> cool

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.810 

so<00:04:18.590> now<00:04:18.709> I'm<00:04:18.829> going<00:04:18.949> to<00:04:19.009> add<00:04:19.160> a<00:04:19.190> little<00:04:19.459> more<00:04:19.699> on

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
so now I'm going to add a little more on

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:32.400 
so now I'm going to add a little more on
my<00:04:19.970> fire

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.070 

and<00:04:33.010> it<00:04:33.520> you<00:04:33.880> have<00:04:34.030> to<00:04:34.180> be<00:04:34.270> careful<00:04:34.810> when

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
and it you have to be careful when

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.410 
and it you have to be careful when
you're<00:04:35.200> blending<00:04:35.410> make<00:04:36.280> sure<00:04:36.610> you<00:04:37.030> know<00:04:37.240> what

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:37.420 
you're blending make sure you know what

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.910 
you're blending make sure you know what
color<00:04:37.660> is<00:04:37.870> stuck<00:04:38.110> on<00:04:38.230> your<00:04:38.410> fingers<00:04:38.740> already

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
color is stuck on your fingers already

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.180 
color is stuck on your fingers already
before<00:04:39.490> you<00:04:39.700> start<00:04:39.970> blending<00:04:40.180> so<00:04:41.190> it's

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
before you start blending so it's

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.070 
before you start blending so it's
helpful<00:04:42.460> to<00:04:42.670> keep<00:04:42.880> a<00:04:43.180> rag<00:04:43.810> or<00:04:44.020> something

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
helpful to keep a rag or something

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.690
