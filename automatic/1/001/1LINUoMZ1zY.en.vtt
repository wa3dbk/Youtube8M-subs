 per share he was happy 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:20.220
 in the previous video about mining extraction tennis 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.220
 we study the cases 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.050
 when it's a benito decimal 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.220
 ive 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.939
 when the second that bad 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.010
 pure newspaper 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:33.330
 and this video 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.050
 will study 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.050
 when it is a mixed newspaper decimal 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.650
 let's analyze the next one 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.460
 one eat 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.460
 5 43 forty three 43 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.710
 and so on 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.470
 I'm not dying 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.470
 I can describe it 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.470
 one like zico 43 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.640
 1 of the whole part 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.870
 5 esther before period 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.740
 and 43 is the period 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.740
 this symbol indicates that it is period 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.180
 to that number I try to pop with x 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.310
 observe 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.280
 the next 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.509
 spur eat is the decimal part 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.380
 It's formed by 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.770
 3 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.460
 let's say it numbers 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.980
 the before two-digit periods 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.060
 corresponding to the period 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.460
 that's why we are going to multiply the 2 'member of what they are 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.180
 by jimmy 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.140
 getting mir x equal amil 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.010
 for ass like to 5 43 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.710
 period 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.710
 operating the right side get 

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:13.549
 miret and spyware at 1500 43 comma 43 as a period 

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:22.099
 the initial equation that this requirement equal to one as to 5 43 we're going to 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.099
 convert 

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:28.499
 pure periodic 

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:29.769
 guide yourself 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.889
 what the entity period the 5 why we're going to multiply by ten 

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:37.379
 the two min members must consume 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:40.379
 let's see 

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:42.789
 10 x same 

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:48.309
 adi is why not like 5 43 is 15 like 43 we ran like a place 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.909
 to the right 

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:55.129
 subtracting this question 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:59.349
 I'm telling you this moment with this member to member we get 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:05.329
 thousand 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:08.539
 x- 10x3 990x 

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:10.679
 same 

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:13.679
 3-3 of 0 4-4 of serÃ³n 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:16.909
 13-5 8 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:20.730
 3 - about 2 astonishment is uncomfortable model no 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:23.220
 clearing ax 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.119
 oppenheim co 

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:29.800
 he thinks he's the same amy 528 psoe did not clash 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.539
 90 

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:34.539
 simplifying 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:37.519
 get coke x is the same 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.729
 to 764 over 4 195 years 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:45.299
 and this one 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:46.420
 per share 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.469
 is the generatitat 

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:51.469
 from number one to 5 43 

00:03:53.279 --> 00:03:56.759
 of this solution 

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:58.049
 we deduce 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.749
 the following formula 

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:02.739
 number without commas 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.739
 - whole part with ante period 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:07.819
 divided by 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.209
 as many nines as figures have the period 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.829
 and as many zeros as if you do not have them before periods 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:17.919
 I applied mola 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.229
 for called directly 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:22.870
 I have the number 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.800
 and we apply the formula 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.770
 what the formula says five more 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.080
 then 1543 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.400
 small part in tehran what is 1 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.620
 with front period that is 5 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.509
 I would do 15 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:40.710
 divided by 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.499
 so many you move 

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:44.629
 as aids have the period 

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:47.349
 the period has two centuries we place 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:48.870
 two dead 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.469
 and so many zeros 

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:53.349
 as a city have the cante period 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:55.909
 and how many a car and we add 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:58.909
 a hill 

00:04:59.749 --> 00:05:02.379
 1500 43-15 

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:05.349
 they give me 1528 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:08.349
 over 900 90 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.539
 i simplifying a 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:12.659
 we obtain 

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:15.240
 764 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:21.050
 divided by 499 what match the previous answer 

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:24.779
 the ING 

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:26.569
 any of these two 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:27.259
 methods
