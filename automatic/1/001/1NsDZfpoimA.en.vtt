about 15 of leader and i need a short

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:36.840 
about 15 of leader and i need a short
piece<00:00:31.860> for<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:35.590> put<00:00:35.800> the<00:00:35.920> second<00:00:36.309> hook<00:00:36.460> on<00:00:36.700> i'm

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
piece for to put the second hook on i'm

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.330 
piece for to put the second hook on i'm
going<00:00:36.970> to<00:00:37.030> put<00:00:37.150> two<00:00:37.360> hooks<00:00:37.600> in<00:00:37.810> this<00:00:37.990> squid<00:00:38.350> so

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
going to put two hooks in this squid so

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.250 
going to put two hooks in this squid so
i'll<00:00:40.210> show<00:00:40.420> you<00:00:40.480> how<00:00:40.600> that<00:00:41.020> works<00:00:41.050> out<00:00:43.230> got<00:00:44.230> a

i'll show you how that works out got a

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.370 
i'll show you how that works out got a
nice<00:00:44.470> squid<00:00:44.980> here<00:00:45.340> it's<00:00:46.090> about<00:00:46.150> 14<00:00:47.079> inches

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:47.380 
nice squid here it's about 14 inches

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.370 
nice squid here it's about 14 inches
long<00:00:47.829> and<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:49.329> will<00:00:49.450> make<00:00:49.630> the<00:00:49.780> squid<00:00:50.110> rigged

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:50.380 
long and it will make the squid rigged

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.930 
long and it will make the squid rigged
up<00:00:50.579> so<00:00:51.579> that<00:00:51.760> it's<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:53.620> matches<00:00:54.220> the<00:00:54.250> length<00:00:54.790> of

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
up so that it's it matches the length of

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.630 
up so that it's it matches the length of
the<00:00:55.060> squid<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:56.739> do<00:00:56.950> that<00:00:59.010> we'll<00:01:00.010> take<00:01:00.190> a<00:01:00.220> 12

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
the squid to do that we'll take a 12

just a normal haywire twist when you do
a<00:01:20.470> haywire<00:01:20.829> twist<00:01:21.159> you<00:01:21.490> have<00:01:21.610> to<00:01:21.729> be<00:01:21.850> careful

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
a haywire twist you have to be careful

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.210 
a haywire twist you have to be careful
to<00:01:22.390> make<00:01:22.659> the<00:01:22.869> wire<00:01:23.049> that's<00:01:23.409> wrapped<00:01:23.860> each

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
to make the wire that's wrapped each

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.020 
to make the wire that's wrapped each
wire<00:01:24.580> around<00:01:25.290> sort<00:01:26.290> of<00:01:26.380> the<00:01:26.500> middle<00:01:26.979> of<00:01:27.189> a<00:01:27.670> line

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
wire around sort of the middle of a line

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.289 
wire around sort of the middle of a line
between<00:01:28.330> the<00:01:28.689> two<00:01:28.899> wires<00:01:29.140> and<00:01:29.970> then<00:01:30.970> you<00:01:31.090> turn

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
between the two wires and then you turn

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:35.249 
between the two wires and then you turn
it<00:01:31.329> up<00:01:31.539> 90<00:01:31.899> degrees<00:01:32.289> and<00:01:33.299> wrap<00:01:34.299> the<00:01:35.110> wire

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
it up 90 degrees and wrap the wire

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:51.200 
it up 90 degrees and wrap the wire
side-by-side

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.440 

then<00:01:51.840> if<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.049> bend<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:53.330> and<00:01:54.830> roll<00:01:55.830> it<00:01:55.860> down<00:01:56.450> it

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
then if you bend it and roll it down it

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.750 
then if you bend it and roll it down it
breaks<00:01:57.630> off<00:01:58.040> when<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.159> breaks<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.640> breaks

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
breaks off when it breaks it breaks

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.160 
breaks off when it breaks it breaks
halfway<00:02:00.360> around<00:02:00.770> so<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:01.800> your<00:02:02.930> you<00:02:03.930> haven't

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
halfway around so that your you haven't

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.290 
halfway around so that your you haven't
got<00:02:04.259> a
