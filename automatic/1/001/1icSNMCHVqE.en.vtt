like<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:29.189> wanted<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:29.939> do<00:00:30.000> some<00:00:30.210> redstone<00:00:30.449> but

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
like I wanted to do some redstone but

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.389 
like I wanted to do some redstone but
also<00:00:30.990> halo<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.619> thought<00:00:31.769> this<00:00:31.949> was<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.160> cool

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
want to add some cryo tubes that

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.110 
want to add some cryo tubes that
actually<00:00:40.290> work<00:00:40.410> this<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.610> bill<00:00:41.760> for<00:00:42.030> you

and you open you know you flip the lever

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.889 
and you open you know you flip the lever
up<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.280> cryo<00:00:47.550> tube<00:00:47.820> becomes<00:00:47.969> apart<00:00:48.450> it's

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
up and the cryo tube becomes apart it's

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.450 
up and the cryo tube becomes apart it's
just<00:00:49.110> really<00:00:49.230> cool<00:00:49.500> because<00:00:49.739> it's<00:00:50.010> just<00:00:50.100> like

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
redstone so like when you combine

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.899 
redstone so like when you combine
redstone<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.690> then<00:01:04.170> cool<00:01:04.739> halo<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.729> know<00:01:05.760> you

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
redstone and then cool halo you know you

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.969 
redstone and then cool halo you know you
it<00:01:06.390> all<00:01:06.750> looks<00:01:06.990> good<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.350> all<00:01:07.409> looks<00:01:07.680> really

pretty simple it's a fairly simple

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.390 
pretty simple it's a fairly simple
redstone<00:01:12.810> build<00:01:13.049> it's<00:01:13.530> fairly<00:01:13.680> simple<00:01:13.979> just

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
redstone build it's fairly simple just

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.670 
redstone build it's fairly simple just
in<00:01:14.549> general<00:01:14.790> it's<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.210> pretty<00:01:15.390> cheap<00:01:16.200> building

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
like halo if you like you know redstone

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.719 
like halo if you like you know redstone
if<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.200> combine<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.650> both<00:01:25.860> there<00:01:26.400> like<00:01:26.580> the

if you combine the both there like the
love<00:01:26.939> child<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.450> redstone<00:01:27.810> in<00:01:28.020> halo<00:01:28.350> it's<00:01:28.530> it's

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
love child of redstone in halo it's it's

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.370 
love child of redstone in halo it's it's
a<00:01:28.920> wonderful<00:01:29.000> it's<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.180> wonderful<00:01:30.659> concept<00:01:31.020> and

a wonderful it's a wonderful concept and
i<00:01:31.409> like<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.860> so<00:01:32.479> red<00:01:33.479> stones<00:01:33.720> pretty<00:01:33.960> simple

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
i like it so red stones pretty simple

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.510 
i like it so red stones pretty simple
you<00:01:34.380> just<00:01:34.470> pretty<00:01:34.740> much<00:01:34.890> want<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.159> put<00:01:35.340> a

you just pretty much want to put a

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.450 
you just pretty much want to put a
redstone<00:01:36.479> torch<00:01:36.810> under<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.650> repeater<00:01:38.009> or<00:01:38.340> not

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
redstone torch under the repeater or not

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.249 
redstone torch under the repeater or not
under<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.759> repeater<00:01:39.030> under<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.420> piston<00:01:39.780> like

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
under the repeater under the piston like

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.510 
under the repeater under the piston like
against<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.740> block<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.220> then<00:01:41.340> put<00:01:41.490> a

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
against the block and then put a

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.429 
against the block and then put a
repeater<00:01:41.790> on<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.060> other<00:01:42.210> side<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.689> pretty

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
repeater on the other side and pretty

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.770 
repeater on the other side and pretty
much<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:43.740> is<00:01:43.799> just<00:01:44.159> it'll<00:01:44.430> reverse<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.119> it

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
much this is just it'll reverse the it

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.920 
much this is just it'll reverse the it
will<00:01:46.560> reverse<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:46.979> Pistons<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:48.210> like<00:01:48.630> they'll

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
will reverse the Pistons so like they'll

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.410 
will reverse the Pistons so like they'll
automatically<00:01:49.560> already<00:01:49.920> be<00:01:50.070> out<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:51.090> then

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
automatically already be out and then

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.760 
automatically already be out and then
when<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.600> flip<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.990> lever<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.350> turn<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.680> on

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
when you flip the lever to turn it on

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.380 
when you flip the lever to turn it on
they<00:01:52.920> retract<00:01:53.369> instead<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:53.850> like<00:01:54.000> turning<00:01:54.299> it

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
they retract instead of like turning it

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.999 
they retract instead of like turning it
on<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.509> have<00:01:54.869> them<00:01:55.049> extent<00:01:55.439> they<00:01:55.590> retract

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
on and have them extent they retract

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.010 
on and have them extent they retract
instead<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.579> it's<00:01:56.670> just<00:01:56.880> it's<00:01:57.149> pretty<00:01:57.719> simple

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
instead and it's just it's pretty simple

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.539 
instead and it's just it's pretty simple
I<00:01:58.259> can't<00:01:58.590> explain<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:59.009> well<00:01:59.130> because<00:01:59.250> I'm<00:01:59.399> just

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
I can't explain it well because I'm just

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.700 
I can't explain it well because I'm just
I'm<00:01:59.790> not<00:01:59.850> good<00:02:00.210> like<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.390> but<00:02:01.170> overall<00:02:01.590> I

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
I'm not good like that but overall I

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.319 
I'm not good like that but overall I
think<00:02:01.829> it's<00:02:02.009> pretty<00:02:02.130> cool<00:02:02.340> build<00:02:02.549> I've<00:02:02.850> stated

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
think it's pretty cool build I've stated

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.999 
think it's pretty cool build I've stated
that<00:02:03.600> before<00:02:04.020> but<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.290> figured<00:02:04.619> I'll<00:02:04.710> stay<00:02:04.950> to

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
that before but I figured I'll stay to

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.530 
that before but I figured I'll stay to
the<00:02:05.189> end<00:02:05.219> because<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:05.579> want<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:06.000> guys<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.509> think
