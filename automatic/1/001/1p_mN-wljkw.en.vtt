00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:08.040
 hello everyone my role of chickens and why is this 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.450
 zombies do not want to maliciously devour my brains 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.000
 you ask me 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.790
 and all because this is the fifth issue 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.170
 reviews of mods and the current mod does 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:23.369
 you zombies I do not know why not me 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:27.330
 overlaid texture but besides you 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:33.140
 zombies you also turn this zombies 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:34.469
 took the risk and you also turn into 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:43.079
 bully 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:45.149
 from and enters who played he knows this way and that 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.730
 me as i said i need out 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.890
 texture but look so pretty 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.030
 cool such zombies with a giant hand 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.440
 and let's consider this mod and 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.210
 let's see what its advantages in what a 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.620
 cons as you see 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:07.430
 make such a structure that does not burn 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:10.890
 and so the pros are that now your 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.820
 Zombie bros and they will not beat you 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.909
 also skeletons and spiders will not beat you 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:20.220
 eat other mobs 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:24.180
 hostile novak rippers as they were 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:31.170
 and they will remain your enemies and they 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:34.140
 will kill you and so i have now 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.170
 off game you see you don't like zombies 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.470
 even if hit 1 winnie he wont not 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.470
 beat 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:47.830
 this is another minus he he just 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:52.880
 so gigantic this minus what are you 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:54.430
 generally can not go out into the light well 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:00.500
 have understood 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:04.640
 be a hedge and by the way burning 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:12.820
 last pretty long here for me 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:18.250
 shakes day elk and so what else and now 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:21.320
 now if you want you not to burn 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.080
 you need to brighten up the helmet absolutely any 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:28.420
 the helmet did not take the iron and you go out and 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:31.760
 rejoice that you do not believe 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:37.640
 for this poor zombie no luck because 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:43.640
 what's the slam limit like mine and so here 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:46.090
 unplugged removed the helmet well here 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:52.610
 cool mod that will allow you 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:54.320
 night run and not be afraid that you 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:59.269
 will eat zombies 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:01.100
 well or other hostile mobs and if you 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.620
 already rejoiced about this gigantic 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.200
 hands so i will tell you that this hand is not 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:12.560
 add you strength and she will beat too 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:14.540
 forces that and usually steve's hand and so if 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.390
