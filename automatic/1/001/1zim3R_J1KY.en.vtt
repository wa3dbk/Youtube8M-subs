00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
don't need to put here all the way at

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.770 
don't need to put here all the way at
the<00:04:13.680> bottom<00:04:13.889> but<00:04:14.220> I'm<00:04:14.970> gonna<00:04:15.150> do<00:04:15.239> it<00:04:15.359> for<00:04:15.540> this

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
the bottom but I'm gonna do it for this

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.400 
the bottom but I'm gonna do it for this
week<00:04:16.079> because<00:04:16.260> I<00:04:16.470> have<00:04:16.620> a<00:04:16.650> lot<00:04:16.829> of<00:04:16.859> hair

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.470 

over<00:04:19.620> here<00:04:19.830> this<00:04:20.070> is<00:04:20.220> where<00:04:20.400> the<00:04:20.430> spandex<00:04:21.060> is

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
over here this is where the spandex is

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.360 
over here this is where the spandex is
and<00:04:21.780> that's<00:04:22.260> why<00:04:22.410> I<00:04:22.440> say<00:04:22.650> it<00:04:22.770> comes<00:04:22.980> in<00:04:23.160> handy

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
and that's why I say it comes in handy

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.910 
and that's why I say it comes in handy
because<00:04:23.810> that's<00:04:24.810> kind<00:04:25.020> of<00:04:25.110> your<00:04:25.290> guide<00:04:25.560> as

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
because that's kind of your guide as

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.130 
because that's kind of your guide as
when<00:04:26.340> you're<00:04:26.490> sewing<00:04:26.760> you<00:04:27.420> don't<00:04:27.630> need<00:04:27.930> this

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
when you're sewing you don't need this

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.200 
when you're sewing you don't need this
much<00:04:28.410> out<00:04:28.650> when<00:04:29.130> you're<00:04:29.250> sewing<00:04:29.490> it<00:04:29.700> but<00:04:29.910> as

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
much out when you're sewing it but as

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.840 
much out when you're sewing it but as
time<00:04:30.840> goes<00:04:31.080> on<00:04:31.260> you<00:04:31.380> can<00:04:31.740> go<00:04:31.890> to<00:04:31.950> snip<00:04:32.310> more<00:04:32.730> and

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
time goes on you can go to snip more and

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.400 
time goes on you can go to snip more and
more<00:04:32.970> as<00:04:33.330> you<00:04:33.390> get<00:04:33.540> more<00:04:33.720> comfortable<00:04:33.930> with

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
more as you get more comfortable with

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.120 
more as you get more comfortable with
sewing<00:04:35.340> it<00:04:35.460> down<00:04:35.670> so<00:04:35.970> that's<00:04:36.150> why<00:04:36.300> is<00:04:36.360> that<00:04:36.600> the

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
sewing it down so that's why is that the

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.720 
sewing it down so that's why is that the
spandex<00:04:38.130> side<00:04:38.570> is<00:04:39.570> very<00:04:40.020> helpful<00:04:40.350> I<00:04:40.890> don't<00:04:41.490> sew

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
spandex side is very helpful I don't sew

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.470 
spandex side is very helpful I don't sew
all<00:04:41.910> the<00:04:41.940> way<00:04:42.290> so<00:04:43.290> the<00:04:43.440> is<00:04:44.270> sometimes<00:04:45.270> I<00:04:45.420> do

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
all the way so the is sometimes I do

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
all the way so the is sometimes I do
sometimes<00:04:45.840> I<00:04:46.080> don't

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
sometimes I don't

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.370 
sometimes I don't
for<00:04:47.100> this<00:04:47.220> one<00:04:47.490> I<00:04:47.520> did<00:04:47.930> but<00:04:48.930> it<00:04:49.050> doesn't<00:04:49.140> really

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
for this one I did but it doesn't really

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.590 
for this one I did but it doesn't really
matter<00:04:49.650> depends<00:04:50.250> on<00:04:50.340> how<00:04:50.490> you<00:04:50.940> feel<00:04:51.150> about<00:04:51.300> it

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
matter depends on how you feel about it

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.750 
matter depends on how you feel about it
this<00:04:51.930> I<00:04:52.470> did<00:04:52.890> was<00:04:53.040> cut<00:04:53.310> it<00:04:53.400> down<00:04:53.550> the<00:04:53.730> middle

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
this I did was cut it down the middle

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.930 
this I did was cut it down the middle
and<00:04:54.590> this<00:04:55.590> is<00:04:55.770> how<00:04:55.920> it<00:04:56.280> looks

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
and this is how it looks

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.960 
and this is how it looks
since<00:04:57.360> you<00:04:57.510> seem<00:04:57.950> most<00:04:58.950> likely<00:04:59.220> I'll<00:04:59.490> go<00:04:59.730> and

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
since you seem most likely I'll go and

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.720 
since you seem most likely I'll go and
fold<00:05:00.210> this<00:05:00.480> see<00:05:01.080> how<00:05:01.170> that<00:05:01.350> is<00:05:01.380> and<00:05:01.830> then<00:05:02.100> I'll

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
fold this see how that is and then I'll

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.090 
fold this see how that is and then I'll
just<00:05:03.180> slow<00:05:03.420> it<00:05:03.660> down<00:05:03.690> so<00:05:04.140> they're<00:05:04.530> more<00:05:04.860> than<00:05:04.950> a

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
just slow it down so they're more than a

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.630 
just slow it down so they're more than a
metre<00:05:06.200> closing<00:05:07.200> point<00:05:07.500> but<00:05:08.130> for<00:05:08.370> the<00:05:08.460> most

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
metre closing point but for the most

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.520 
metre closing point but for the most
part<00:05:08.760> this<00:05:09.030> is<00:05:09.150> all<00:05:09.330> and<00:05:10.110> that's<00:05:10.260> what<00:05:10.410> you

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
part this is all and that's what you

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.980 
part this is all and that's what you
should<00:05:10.740> get<00:05:11.090> so<00:05:12.090> think<00:05:12.450> of<00:05:12.540> it<00:05:12.660> as<00:05:12.720> an

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
should get so think of it as an

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.690 
should get so think of it as an
invisible<00:05:13.230> part<00:05:13.710> and<00:05:14.100> you<00:05:14.160> just<00:05:14.310> come<00:05:14.520> down

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
invisible part and you just come down

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.250 
invisible part and you just come down
the<00:05:14.790> middle<00:05:14.970> so<00:05:15.510> this<00:05:15.630> is<00:05:15.810> what<00:05:15.960> I<00:05:15.990> finished

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
the middle so this is what I finished

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.770 
the middle so this is what I finished
project<00:05:16.830> project<00:05:17.700> should<00:05:18.000> look<00:05:18.060> we'll<00:05:18.660> be
