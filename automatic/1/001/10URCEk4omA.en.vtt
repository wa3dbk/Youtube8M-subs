there<00:02:04.210> it<00:02:04.330> kind<00:02:04.510> of<00:02:04.540> looks<00:02:04.720> like<00:02:04.840> there's<00:02:05.020> a

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
there it kind of looks like there's a

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.650 
there it kind of looks like there's a
card<00:02:05.290> there<00:02:05.470> though<00:02:06.240> but<00:02:07.240> there's<00:02:07.420> definitely

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
card there though but there's definitely

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:16.050

not<00:02:09.300> comp<00:02:10.300> ones<00:02:10.570> in<00:02:10.840> okay<00:02:14.520> it<00:02:15.520> looks<00:02:15.790> like

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
not comp ones in okay it looks like

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.290 
not comp ones in okay it looks like
there's<00:02:16.770> usually<00:02:17.770> there's<00:02:18.310> something<00:02:19.030> I<00:02:19.120> can

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
there's usually there's something I can

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.060 
there's usually there's something I can
do<00:02:19.510> but<00:02:20.320> I<00:02:20.380> guess<00:02:20.709> I'll<00:02:20.950> just<00:02:21.070> set<00:02:21.340> that<00:02:21.550> and

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
do but I guess I'll just set that and

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.410 
do but I guess I'll just set that and
end<00:02:24.630> and<00:02:25.630> maybe<00:02:26.200> he'll<00:02:26.470> kill<00:02:26.680> my<00:02:26.830> plague

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420
