00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:11.320
 cristina there is one is a support teacher but also directs a series that 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.959
 is called 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:13.589
 hey bro 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:19.599
 that I enter how to clean between the many sides and the many facets of a person 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:22.689
 because in particular bet with wings 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.989
 Accompanied text facilitated for those who have lost dyslexia or problems for example 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:32.020
 even for a child who does not come from an Italian context 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.390
 penis I would start is from his experience and doctor accept the 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.989
 as a support teacher and reading facilitator 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.740
 that the first mode 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.120
 non-technological 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.560
 but valid at the bottom are a little for everyone then there are different ways of reading 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.810
 to communicate what problems he had to face 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.990
 elaborating with dyslexic pupils 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.130
 mythomaniac difficulty in recommending free to read 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.080
 and both in the library and now a bookstore they did not find any books today 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.300
 comes back from the quest 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.280
 tor this necklace that perhaps directs it 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.500
 and you can frame the necklace is called free because free 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.380
 and now after more back 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.600
 in fact, the logo is a winged horse with wheels 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.950
 the horse is detached and the fast is dynamic and fast 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.000
 and those empty cards these aleeeeee symbolizes you can't bet online 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.950
 beautiful olycom very dyes you see we have 200 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:39.820
 new 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.990
 I always fly away I think that this was also born a show 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.800
 theatrical saves the data of the iraque publication made history 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.440
 of a girl with reading difficulties 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.810
 good theater company from vicenza 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.320
 wanted me to do a stage show contract works the power is for 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.860
 tell the dyslexia also the black kids the elementary schools of school 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.030
 average 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.869
 well it must be said that then many of us have difficulty reading 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.250
 it's actually not that limited a problem we have people who have 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.640
 problems reading aloud to expose aloud and then these 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.960
 books are a great workbook in my opinion to share to extend 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.540
 there are particular characteristics that are not noticed at the beginning 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.379
 the fountain is an English source 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:30.909
 mv livorno li 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:36.659
 foam say this in Italy 4% of girls of school age suffer from this 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:41.629
 disturbance because it is only lack of exercise a refusal 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:46.420
 of schooling can also there is its own problem and now it comes 

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:49.189
 recognized with me 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:54.609
 discomfort as a learning difficulty once and classified 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:56.470
 as a careless little girl 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.719
 who did not want to study that 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:04.680
 we easily renounce the study for those who maybe had little interest 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.259
 desire for silence, emule and the French writer daniel breast perna cake was 

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:15.339
 a very bad student many disastrous and still today admits to be for example 

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:20.350
 spelling and then writing his novels with 2 dictionaries next to them 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.769
 this does not detract from the magnitude obviously of his writing 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.379
 it is only a matter of studying strategy to help oneself with famous people of the 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:30.219
 history there are many 

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:35.919
 as anstein pablo picasso as also writers as agate cristi 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:40.859
 therefore surely their condemnation of their intelligence and creativity are 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:42.699
 managed to compensate 

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:45.219
 a little this difficulty 

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:51.009
 of course you can dyslexia levels are known medium-severe note is one of the series 

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:56.379
 that maybe you can read gmail even if you have a hard time but anyway 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:00.739
 sufficiently and to understand what is in law 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:05.249
 fringe dyslexia steely unfortunately does not allow the law to remain autonomous 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:08.999
 here is no veil on the street. 

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:13.659
 tv I would not like to specify why they are stories and a lot are also in the eu 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:15.809
 belli can also be read online 

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:21.560
 we thank text it is true that he did the filming pll internal pages of the 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.309
 first book always want to go away 

00:04:23.309 --> 00:04:27.649
 filming is also done of the theatrical show you can find n 

00:04:27.649 --> 00:04:31.319
 some white information some tips 

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:36.699
 emmen of course we are also trying to encourage a dyslexic boy to read 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:41.059
 because reading and at the base then absolutely notes this sea that 

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:45.150
 see the reading aloud then a great comfort even reading for 

00:04:45.149 --> 00:04:47.580
 another read each other 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.410
 here taking into account the different intelligences of the different and abilities 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:55.270
 therefore doctor also this manual 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.110
 for parents for teachers for friends and autism sufferers who 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.449
 you have published very important very important above all not me 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:07.449
 I also attach alarm doctor 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:13.360
 guess the support teacher is not always prepared you are not not always 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.150
 they also have the tools 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.210
 to work well immediately 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:24.630
 so this linux operating manual for mxr parent teachers to address 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:25.990
 your own to help 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.960
 the autistic moon 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.280
 to find the right environment 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.050
 to immediately find fair-trade activities that are then structured 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:36.589
 activities to the environment 

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:39.029
 and easy to read 

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:44.819
 this is the data that greatly increases the predisposition to communicate 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:50.089
 with everyone the school if it is a school of democracy as there is diversity 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:54.520
 Central doctor as a support teacher sees it 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.690
 yes, and it is also a value that is added, and to realize one's own 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.559
 limits and accept the limits of others 

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:05.619
 it also helps to grow and mature 

00:06:05.619 --> 00:06:07.410
 embÃ© douche 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.870
 when yes you think that you are a disabled otaku 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:16.020
 well it's a nice montessori method and was born for kids with another 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.789
 difficulty but now you can more authoritatively than mac 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:25.150
 tell me endless ways I was pedagogical and technological that they were 

00:06:25.149 --> 00:06:28.440
 born at the beginning for people with disabilities 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.839
 in short, exbo are in common use 

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:34.110
 in fact in these books and everyone really likes them 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.949

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:42.770
 and when we read and face them and honey class these topics we see 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.139
 that attention is always very high 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:50.199
