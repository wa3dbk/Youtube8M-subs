 the stadium revolution to imperial cow 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:09.420
 oscar reyna but the central referee and 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.120
 we leave immediately at the start 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.540
 of the match the first minute shot of 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.150
 corner 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.510
 hysterical princes of the imperial code 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.029
 the header to the crossbar today the rebound 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.250
 everywhere and gerson tinoco already what 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.519
 they achieve to lyon the renacionalizaciÃ³n and there 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.920
 is tinoco noting the first of his 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.109

 of all the times of Copan first goal 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.860
 in major league 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.750
 already really this is the one that is taken as 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.040
 first goal with an operation 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.910
 International History and Statistics 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.070
 pathological and nothing to do for the 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.560
 goalkeeper omar mendoza 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.840
 so 10 you see her again in the attack 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:53.320
 medium distance shots near the 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.350
 manuel's right stick soda the ball 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:01.150
 it was tyson that totally finished off 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:04.809
 deviated kick- off tyson night 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:07.810
 the other big man 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.370
 great service but it was not the one 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.940
 did the pass other no 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.940
 was 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.990
 I do not lie nor from the eleven 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.060
 but who came out playing was Copan 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:28.090
 imperial and he did it by left good 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.969
 play to finish and score a goal 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.979
 Argenis FernÃ¡ndez in Spanish his first 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:36.350
 goal in the major league that so 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:38.840
 celebrated the crazy gemini 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.530
 they gave me arsenic argenis and write down the 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.300
 second colon 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.770
 and look little ball 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.659
 no but it's the guy in 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:52.500
 not Colombian 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:57.110
 at the end there is only one so 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.110
 in any case of the ui of the uv of breast 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:10.800
 horrible Colombian that we lack the 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.990
 steam the ball and when it comes out 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:17.220
 but in the small area like not doing 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:22.160
 lack is missing if the card is 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:28.190
 good churches for 140 faults and 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.190
 cards and then cards 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:35.830
 to the one who has said 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:38.710
 but tyson with the touch they took it away 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:42.610
 and the auction that is totally out of 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:44.920
 annotation the last center - a passed in 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.720
 band and the third one was not arriving 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.940
 close to the second half of the match 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.640
 revolution stadium the guataca no 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.140
 I needed to discount the case above 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.090
 crossbar 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.980
 carlos kamiani felix grabbed good 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.920
 distance and I hit it from inside edge or 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.620
 difficult for the archer soda manuel soda 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.110
 but it ended up solving the defense and 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.270
 in this fernandez the half turn without 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.430
 problems for mendoza in our 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.180
 lie well here within the area and the 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:16.510
 right out there are something I asked 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:19.140
 inside the area it seemed like the third 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.550
 but well mendoza still 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.550
 or criminal 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.820
 that man that mistake 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:31.020
 will ferrell although not correct is the 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.020
 referee walter no 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:37.530
 was to look for queen 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.269
 I do not give hand to hit 37 and they 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.330
 I'm good to change and for the 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:45.690
 discount make rage and by the center 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.590
 only and the one believed in the tie so 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.629
 less 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.910
 let's see if I could reach the draw yet 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:55.230
 turn the marker over he would be a 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:57.830
 good study how many penalty shots per 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:02.069
 no play are made to decent crises are 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:03.900
 more than 15 points 20 percent not 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:07.370
 good move because it usually is 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.370
 gets 80% of penalties 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.760
 in the ball for Tyson Tyson played 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:16.820
 better by right the auction that follows 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.220
 totally up good he was still in 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:23.620
 the domain and he had the rebound 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:26.150
 still center because good barrier 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.680
 excellent sweep Coban defended himself with 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.420
 all 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.270
 it can go like this 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:35.690
 and the party still had Coban 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.690
 unbeaten
