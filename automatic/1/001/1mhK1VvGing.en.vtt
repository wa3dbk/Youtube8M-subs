guys<00:01:14.770> it's<00:01:15.130> interesting<00:01:15.729> to<00:01:16.060> see<00:01:16.270> that<00:01:16.300> note<00:01:16.930> 3

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
guys it's interesting to see that note 3

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.390 
guys it's interesting to see that note 3
has<00:01:17.170> booted<00:01:17.470> up<00:01:17.710> quickly<00:01:17.920> for<00:01:18.040> us<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:20.369> Ron<00:01:21.369> is

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
has booted up quickly for us and Ron is

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.499 
has booted up quickly for us and Ron is
taking<00:01:21.940> some<00:01:22.149> time<00:01:22.420> in<00:01:22.690> restarting<00:01:24.509> Android

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
taking some time in restarting Android

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:27.719 
taking some time in restarting Android
4.3<00:01:26.080> operating<00:01:26.619> system<00:01:27.039> now<00:01:27.310> it<00:01:27.520> has

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
4.3 operating system now it has

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.790 
4.3 operating system now it has
restarted<00:01:28.330> a<00:01:28.539> system<00:01:28.869> for<00:01:29.020> us<00:01:29.080> now<00:01:29.500> we<00:01:29.560> are

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
restarted a system for us now we are

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.990 
restarted a system for us now we are
going<00:01:29.979> to<00:01:30.100> power<00:01:30.340> all<00:01:30.550> these<00:01:30.729> devices

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
going to power all these devices

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:56.910 
going to power all these devices
together<00:01:39.509> there<00:01:40.509> we<00:01:40.600> go

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.830 

so<00:01:57.920> as<00:01:58.190> I<00:01:58.220> think<00:01:58.640> round<00:01:59.000> is<00:01:59.150> of<00:01:59.300> in<00:01:59.390> our<00:01:59.480> hair

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
so as I think round is of in our hair

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.070 
so as I think round is of in our hair
and<00:02:00.580> it<00:02:01.580> has<00:02:01.820> power<00:02:02.150> off<00:02:02.390> quickly<00:02:02.630> for<00:02:02.930> us

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
and it has power off quickly for us

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.310 
and it has power off quickly for us
because<00:02:03.320> capacitive<00:02:04.190> touchscreen<00:02:04.700> buttons

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
because capacitive touchscreen buttons

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.620 
because capacitive touchscreen buttons
were<00:02:06.320> still<00:02:06.710> on<00:02:06.920> when<00:02:07.460> round<00:02:08.000> turned<00:02:08.450> off

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
were still on when round turned off

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.230 
were still on when round turned off
completely<00:02:09.250> now<00:02:10.250> we<00:02:10.310> are<00:02:10.550> going<00:02:10.700> to<00:02:10.790> boot<00:02:11.090> up

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
completely now we are going to boot up

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:34.699 
completely now we are going to boot up
these<00:02:11.420> devices<00:02:11.900> together

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.429 

so<00:02:35.519> guys<00:02:35.700> north<00:02:36.360> we<00:02:36.599> had<00:02:36.750> put<00:02:36.989> it<00:02:37.110> up<00:02:37.230> quickly

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:37.439 
so guys north we had put it up quickly

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:43.190 
so guys north we had put it up quickly
for<00:02:37.769> us<00:02:38.569> again<00:02:40.790> now<00:02:41.790> we<00:02:41.849> are<00:02:42.450> going<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:42.959> get

core 3907 so guys I personally believe
the<00:04:58.539> reason<00:04:58.870> of<00:04:58.990> getting<00:04:59.020> higher<00:04:59.680> score<00:05:00.070> on

the reason of getting higher score on

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.050 
the reason of getting higher score on
around<00:05:00.789> is<00:05:01.060> just<00:05:01.120> because<00:05:02.340> we<00:05:03.340> have<00:05:03.550> something

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
around is just because we have something

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.990 
around is just because we have something
missings<00:05:04.450> on<00:05:04.600> it<00:05:04.750> like<00:05:05.169> a<00:05:05.410> span<00:05:06.130> and<00:05:06.310> multi

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
missings on it like a span and multi

missings on it like a span and multi
windows<00:05:07.300> that<00:05:07.479> we<00:05:07.660> have<00:05:07.810> on<00:05:07.930> node<00:05:08.140> 3<00:05:08.349> when<00:05:08.560> you
