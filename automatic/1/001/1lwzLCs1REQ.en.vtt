 to get to munich we are going to 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.859
 wrong version again from Monique in 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.350
 relationship here in color we're not talking about 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.119
 really various audio varieties 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.279
 validating color variations of your 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.689
 wardrobe but in a correct way 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.609
 in the case here she is wearing a blouse 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.940
 green flag brand viscose knit 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.130
 that the green people I love with passion and 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.870
 blue also house staff who already 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.790
 You know why my work knows I speak. 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.260
 I always fall short, I think it's 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.829
 a color that illuminates people can be 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.550
 blonde mulatto brunette of all colors of 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.010
 skin 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.559
 But you're very welcome here. 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.250
 if what you are taking in relation to 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.469
 mo'nique 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.780
 She's up to here, she's fine. 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.460
 a touch that have a bad white 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.070
 perfect if I had a short one 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.350
 white with a white trousers 10 would look 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.019
 a show, this piece is the latest fashion 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.320
 this school line owner Middle Falls owner I 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.159
 I think the sea is so more stylish, right? 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.710
 I think it's really cool, it's terrible to stay 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:16.200
 horrible literally are you sometimes in 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.229
 house want to make such a horton shades 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.780
 and the ton sur ton actually that is when 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.420
 you see with two shades that resemble 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.860
 that are harmonious in shades of green 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.770
 in case the attraction was the duty to be 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.320
 only the tone of green pool in time 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.880
 nothing to do with the range of greens on 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.180
 line then green flag people 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.390
 are two tones that did not look cool 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.030
 really did not stay refined production 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.880
 beautiful modern and everything else and on foot us 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.640
 we put what an angu butt that I think 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.869
 That's cool, it's a summer boot actually. 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.689
 because it has the holes in the sides 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.750
 for those who do not know the broad bush when 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.119
 you literally close your whole foot and 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.780
 stay more practical and a boot 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.969
 short and the line of the pet's da 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.490
 because the whole vote of the open 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.890
 summer boot would be a boot for 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.450
 summer is where she begins she is 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.180
 on her foot she has the leaks 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.220
 part of the side of the foot and also has 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.760
 this guy in front of his 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.470
 jeans 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.760
 This color as I always speak of your 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.530
 Beige caac beige mouse tones is off white guess 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.480
 Who are we all very welcome to people? 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.340
 also had our kind too 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.380
 so I'll thank you for that 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.150
 while Monique will come back later 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.849
 a correct version for you to feel 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.819
 in relation to my pants can come my 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:39.130
 beautiful blonde also that cute indy 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.440
 She's in a production like this. 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.180
 your blouse is an orange mix 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.190
 with the father gives is for those who do not know that 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.620
 this idea is when you play this 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.470
 a mixture of brushstrokes and 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.110
 mesh and there are these rates 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.090
 You can never catch him, he only has one. 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.690
 son already has the boxes but also has 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.569
 the barbarian flu straf rates gives an effect 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.209
 very chic and something else makro is 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:06.370
 a very good fixed cost and only that the 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.590
 Stingy catch all very nice nice 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.750
 such an attempt to detail that is 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.220
 well dug for what I did but confirmed 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.989
 a topic in price 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.600
 each with side pages to people 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.250
 You need to be naked so you do not fall into that 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.620
 vulgarity that I think fashion in 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.829
 be careful not to be okay and place 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.720
 what is wrong is the same bid 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:29.049
 of total of the tone south of ton that I know what I 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.850
 gradient an orange from above has nothing 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:34.060
 to see people with short shorts 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:36.880
 are more open orange does not combine 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.730
 with the orange ranges from above then 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.799
 which being a piece the truth is 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.859
 smart that looks nice does not talk to 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.819
 same color language then 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:48.310
 literally 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.049
 I did not like them and they will come back to 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.739
 you in the correct version we go 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:55.780
 show what part of them the blouse of 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.450
 what shape does it look prettier and much 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.260
 more elegant than the 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.849
 bass 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.410
 They'll be back in a bit. 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.410
 correct version for you 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.060
 Well people, now, continuing to arrive 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.110
 Munich looks how beautiful she is. 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.670
 not overflow 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.070
 Look who's coming now to 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:18.010
 You understand, she was with a 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.750
 beautiful jeans in green tube 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.609
 This is more that it had nothing to do with it. 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.550
 concrete fillet there was nothing to Low 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.290
 up and in terms of tones is in 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.050
 because sometimes the tone 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.610
 about tom it's cool but that 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.350
 composition of the green flag with the 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.150
 workshop to adapt 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.430
 we put what we kept to 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.560
 same kitchen with the same tops in 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.600
 white pants looking like I think so 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.090
 a show I always talk to you 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.950
 could be with stampa ball strass 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.630
 Dedicated is that you can 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.740
 make a nice harmony in relation to 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.419
 ford bafta 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.810
 we put in it that the shorts 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:54.270
 boyfriend who is there has already been used and 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.470
 truth has not fallen out of style in this 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.900
 extending our spring collection 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.270
 summer too this is cool and say the 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.900
 people with whom she has practically 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:07.990
 coast on this table at the top is mannequin 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.700
 38 This is important to say what 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.800
 I'm telling you this because I 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.200
 because the boyfriend line how much time 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.729
 do not you have to be thin even if 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.590
 to use it is using a line well 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:20.140
 stripped that thing off without any further 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:23.590
 and that the stripped part owner dropped 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:25.510
 fall of a coast turn it looks 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.940
 Grace behind said look, you see, it's a 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.290
 very broad piece in sousa gostosa 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.450
 comfortable 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:34.510
 This is very cool here. 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:36.070
 marchinha person can go back up to that 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.390
 a person marching on top 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.150
 but the bottom 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:42.390
 do not even think because we 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.430
 delivery is brown but the last time 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:46.170
 the waist -high waist line but she 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.640
 has the folds and has all this 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:49.830
 volume at the front that the front line 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:53.220
 so it really fits as problematic as 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:55.410
 it're 40 but with 40 and foot we 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.660
 we kept the same sandal as that 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.910
 san angelo ti that I told you at 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.470
 persimmon tone I nor is beautiful to 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.630
 have an ice cream to go to the mall 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.790
 to give everyone a repeat 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:08.640
 friends saw fall until a little bit 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:10.470
 in the sequence not yet in the same 

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.630
 version with the blouse we kept the 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.700
 same her blouse for you anyone who 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:16.740
 the tacks on my cross are using 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:19.020
 A lot of stamping is not only a pet 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.880
 but also cross has several titles of the 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.930
 style of prints today is very cool 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.670
 also 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:26.400
 it is she who puts on what is a 

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:28.460
 jeans because it could be an outlet 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:32.130
 of jeans with a white shorts 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:34.470
 short anton a haiti wire in brown 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:36.390
 in the only car we're showing 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:38.190
 you a correct version because 

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.760
 She was also in a tone of 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.410
 to see né 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.210
 it was a much more open orange tint 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:43.920
 which did not match her with orange 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:46.920
 up then look how much she got 

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:50.220
 more fashionable with this look a pair of pants 

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:52.410
 skinny in the tone of blue much more closed and 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:54.750
 we kept her same sandal as 

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:56.340
 the black sandal often makes 

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:58.620
 much missing in our wardrobe I 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:00.780
 I always say that I do not know, thank you. 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.760
 saw Indians from here a little bit and look us 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:05.220
