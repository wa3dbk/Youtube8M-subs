 vitaly has already been associated with the games on the tracks for them she wanted 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.280
 it is made that we do it because with the first media l try the coffin 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:26.140
 Alger 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.009
 do not understand the left-handedness in the fixed indeed it did not apply 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.079
 still open to the public and today we will try simply 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.330
 the water says the most powerful of the market attention it is not about 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:36.710
 could believe it in a fun way 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.710
 but just thank him 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.940
 the page of my life reacted 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.590
 I did it these two exchangers modern leasing algeria lausanne 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.160
 regional championships 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.400
 fnsea and young farmers 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.170
 there are - 0 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.840
 his son in egypt 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.900
 the climate effect the fireworks to accommodate 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.560
 three other cases 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.640
 let's talk about the cftc in break version in the first set before jumping to the 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.570
 also lastly it differentiates from the version to 6 in the 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.130
 time 2 some characteristic elements you also have 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.580
 here look but in primary 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.080
 side that puts the fog lights are now 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.430
 in the optical blocks 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.430
 you have huge hand at the shield level 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.360
 already on the way 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.659
 19 inches of series 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.750
 20 inches optional as is the case today 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.800
 with the option of opting for ceramic brakes at the airport at the 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.480
 difference especially the shield was fully back diffuser and 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.449
 you go 

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:19.310
 2 double exhaust huge 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.099
 and our favorite to keep under the wing level 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.109
 allergic people who are referring 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:28.359
 osef audi 80 controls then the inside of the audi rs6 not really 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:31.379
 change in the design of the dashboard and then found 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.599
 of audi a6 all the cool some differences comparison look if the 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:39.689
 seductive and carole garnishes that makes all the difference the buttons it's 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:40.899
 not plastic 

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:43.019
 these desserts and more specifically the fight 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.019
 we only lost the carbon spieser on the center console 

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:49.019
 on the dashboard you also have 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.409
 on the doors you also have a three-spoke sport steering wheel abbass 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:53.629
 flat 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:54.889
 beautiful 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:56.719
 leather bucket seats 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:59.139
 we would have liked a little better but unfortunately it's good 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:02.319
 not good enough but we would have liked better and especially the big force of 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.389
 the audi rs6 and reckons that it's a real standalone project you can carry 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:07.659
 also rear passengers 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:10.229
 but also unloading and for his cell 

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:13.299
 and now we're going to show you what the audi rs6 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.839
 flying off on the circuit of left-handed fertÃ© attention it deposits a 

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:19.839
 project we do not know how to do 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.989
 traorÃ© so I'm not going to their place at 80 days 

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:28.379
 the break unfortunately the odious 10 years on the market 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.690
 brown to donate oneself and a very informative direction very 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:32.649
 accurate 

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:35.639
 at the automatic gearbox in case of sequential mode you have 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:38.509
 also some pallets behind the wheel to send the afp I'm really 

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:40.609
 traditional right 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:44.019
 I want to put in automatic sport mode 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.249
 in other cases shorter reports 

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:50.299
 dumontet faster report too and at any time if you fancy you 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:53.479
 can drive like and be it a driving example 

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:56.909
 propagandists so pallets that are placed relatively natural in 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:59.909
 agora I go down wins 

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:04.449
 and right will 

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:07.319
 the busy bounces report that's it 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.709
 so it's quite intuitive launched in st-malo we will say despite the power 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.650
 audi a6 is already fascinating enough you advance pants for coffees 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.370
 of dollars so these engines that is not light that has some inertia cam 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.370
 to driving but this winter very very much watching 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.830
 so finally the author 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.400
 sally sall diplomate had four occasions 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.969
 we feel good yes and that a lot of 850 meters roughly we have 160 and 180 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:38.930
 so that that is relatively strong is a third in 1 0 to 100 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:42.719
 0 1 millimeter stop these 21 seconds that's about the time of a 

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:45.210
 lamborghini gallardo is to say that it's a break but it grows 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.259
 very very very very 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:48.080
 installments paid to his parents 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.050
 it's because these are the rassam accesses are quite impressive 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.659
 for everyday use and power only three suspension settings on 

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:56.249
 strongly discourages you 

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:57.379
 sport mode 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:00.270
 since it is fierce port is very very hard so public and bleeding 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.179
 his way you feel it you have back pain especially as to the seats 

00:05:03.179 --> 00:05:05.849
 sport bac and we do not really so rather a new concept 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:09.300
 dynamic that is already not bad in this case it's a good behavior 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.099
 green liberal opponents 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:14.459
 at the level is tightening and of course our concerts largely this famous fashion sport 

00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:16.990
 since it prevents any roll 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.809
 it is a motricity symbol 

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:22.339
 photo pb the distribution of the torque 6 or 5% on the back 40 on the front 

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:26.050
 so it's understandable at times Monday in front of a propulsion that slides 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.159
 slightly but still be careful to add the fat mass the fat 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:31.760
 problem of racist auditing because it's not necessarily the circuit 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.460
 his favorite field of choice 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.480
 the audi rs6 is simply the fastest break in the world 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.980
 it combines both the performance of the athlete and the practical and 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:45.410
 traditional moreact actually has so 580 horsepower 605 danito to put over 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.320
 5 80 km hour so it's really the exceptional cars these engines the 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.720
 convent it's at the fastest audit on the market right now but woe 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.210
 to him is not only advantages to orsay it's very heavy it's more than 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.030
 doubt in the north is not necessarily predict it is not very very 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.719
 comfortable on the circuit itself is his gun acceleration 

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:04.809
 its relatively high consumption of about 20 liters of water prayer 

00:06:04.809 --> 00:06:08.399
 unfortunately it's also a price the price is 5 14 thousand euros on the 

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:09.309
 team auction 

00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:11.499
 but the two politicians still love there and what is really 

00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:14.729
 very nice proof is soon Christmas ben I asked 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:15.979
 against robert morel 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:16.839
 an audi rs6
