we've got to even to be to gameplay a

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.999 
we've got to even to be to gameplay a
lot<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.750> people<00:01:33.990> are<00:01:34.110> saying<00:01:34.409> who<00:01:34.710> are<00:01:34.799> playing

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
lot of people are saying who are playing

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.580 
lot of people are saying who are playing
the<00:01:35.100> beta<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.460> say<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.939> 3v3<00:01:36.439> actually<00:01:37.439> is

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
the beta to say that the 3v3 actually is

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.249 
the beta to say that the 3v3 actually is
pretty<00:01:37.920> fun<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.780> that<00:01:39.780> was<00:01:39.960> something<00:01:40.140> that

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
pretty fun and that was something that

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.569 
pretty fun and that was something that
was<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.470> little<00:01:40.619> bit<00:01:40.710> skeptical<00:01:40.979> about<00:01:41.250> when<00:01:41.549> I

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
was a little bit skeptical about when I

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.249 
was a little bit skeptical about when I
first<00:01:42.000> saw<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.180> last<00:01:42.420> night<00:01:42.570> because<00:01:42.840> 3<00:01:43.110> B<00:01:43.229> 3

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
first saw it last night because 3 B 3

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.200 
first saw it last night because 3 B 3
was<00:01:43.590> actually<00:01:43.950> confirmed<00:01:44.310> last<00:01:44.759> night<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.119> be

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
was actually confirmed last night to be

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.330 
was actually confirmed last night to be
in<00:01:45.299> xenoverse<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:45.899> was<00:01:46.770> kind<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:46.979> skeptical

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
in xenoverse I was kind of skeptical

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.859 
in xenoverse I was kind of skeptical
because<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:48.030> seemed<00:01:48.299> like<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.509> was<00:01:48.540> trying<00:01:48.810> to

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
because it seemed like it was trying to

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.469 
because it seemed like it was trying to
do<00:01:48.930> what<00:01:49.079> battle<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.530> Z<00:01:50.040> was<00:01:50.250> doing<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.850> I

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
do what battle of Z was doing and I

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.120 
do what battle of Z was doing and I
wasn't<00:01:52.079> sure<00:01:52.290> if<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.500> was<00:01:52.590> gonna<00:01:52.770> try<00:01:53.009> and

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
wasn't sure if it was gonna try and

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.950 
wasn't sure if it was gonna try and
build<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.369> entire<00:01:53.640> game<00:01:53.880> around<00:01:54.329> that

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
build the entire game around that

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.600 
build the entire game around that
mechanic<00:01:55.470> because<00:01:55.590> what<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.280> problem<00:01:56.549> with

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
mechanic because what the problem with

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.580 
mechanic because what the problem with
battle<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:56.969> he<00:01:57.060> was<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.540> well<00:01:57.930> at<00:01:58.020> least<00:01:58.200> in

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
battle is he was that well at least in

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.319 
battle is he was that well at least in
my<00:01:58.829> opinion<00:01:58.979> was<00:01:59.399> that<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.909> couldn't<00:02:00.119> fight

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
my opinion was that you couldn't fight

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.940 
my opinion was that you couldn't fight
one-on-one<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.990> obviously<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.649> fact<00:02:01.829> that

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
one-on-one and obviously the fact that

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.249 
one-on-one and obviously the fact that
the<00:02:02.100> game<00:02:02.250> has<00:02:02.790> its<00:02:02.939> own<00:02:03.060> flaws<00:02:03.329> is<00:02:03.600> also<00:02:04.110> that

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
the game has its own flaws is also that

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.630 
the game has its own flaws is also that
but<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.740> game<00:02:04.890> seemed<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.189> be<00:02:05.310> built<00:02:05.520> around

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
but the game seemed to be built around

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.229 
but the game seemed to be built around
the<00:02:05.939> multiple<00:02:06.869> fighting<00:02:07.350> of<00:02:08.239> characters

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
the multiple fighting of characters

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.729 
the multiple fighting of characters
mechanic<00:02:09.599> like<00:02:09.660> 3v3

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
mechanic like 3v3

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.680 
mechanic like 3v3
44<00:02:11.580> or<00:02:11.670> whatever<00:02:11.910> it<00:02:12.150> just<00:02:12.360> seemed<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.629> be

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
44 or whatever it just seemed to be

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.520 
44 or whatever it just seemed to be
mainly<00:02:13.290> full

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
mainly full

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.130 
mainly full
around<00:02:13.860> that<00:02:14.069> and<00:02:14.280> in<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.450> universe<00:02:15.780> it<00:02:15.930> seems

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
around that and in the universe it seems

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.420 
around that and in the universe it seems
like<00:02:16.350> they<00:02:16.500> are<00:02:16.620> allowing<00:02:16.830> you<00:02:17.100> to<00:02:17.130> actually

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
like they are allowing you to actually

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.120 
like they are allowing you to actually
play<00:02:17.970> 1v1<00:02:18.240> and<00:02:18.900> they're<00:02:19.440> building<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:19.890> around

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
play 1v1 and they're building it around

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.059 
play 1v1 and they're building it around
1v1<00:02:20.490> and<00:02:20.880> it<00:02:21.420> apparently<00:02:22.050> transitions<00:02:22.860> well

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
1v1 and it apparently transitions well

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.010 
1v1 and it apparently transitions well
into<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.370> into<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:24.030> 3/3<00:02:24.480> I<00:02:24.510> don't<00:02:24.750> know<00:02:24.870> I've

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
into the into the 3/3 I don't know I've

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.830 
into the into the 3/3 I don't know I've
only<00:02:25.110> gotten<00:02:25.800> this<00:02:26.040> from<00:02:26.540> specific<00:02:27.540> people

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
only gotten this from specific people

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.020 
only gotten this from specific people
who<00:02:27.990> have<00:02:28.110> actually<00:02:28.680> played<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:29.550> beta<00:02:29.730> I

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
who have actually played the beta I

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.640 
who have actually played the beta I
haven't<00:02:30.660> gotten<00:02:30.780> to<00:02:30.870> play<00:02:31.050> it<00:02:31.110> myself<00:02:31.260> so<00:02:31.590> I

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
haven't gotten to play it myself so I

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.740 
haven't gotten to play it myself so I
honestly<00:02:31.830> don't<00:02:32.190> know<00:02:32.310> but<00:02:33.180> from<00:02:33.569> the

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
honestly don't know but from the

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.500 
honestly don't know but from the
customization<00:02:34.410> for<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:34.950> characters<00:02:35.819> it

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
customization for the characters it

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.860 
customization for the characters it
seems<00:02:36.870> that<00:02:37.140> it's<00:02:37.290> actually<00:02:37.730> somewhat<00:02:38.730> ver<00:02:38.940> el

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
seems that it's actually somewhat ver el

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.510 
seems that it's actually somewhat ver el
it<00:02:40.319> seems<00:02:40.650> like<00:02:40.739> you're<00:02:40.860> actually<00:02:41.160> able<00:02:41.370> to

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
it seems like you're actually able to

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.220 
it seems like you're actually able to
have<00:02:41.640> some<00:02:41.819> variety<00:02:42.209> in<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.600> beta<00:02:42.810> it<00:02:43.020> seems

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
have some variety in the beta it seems

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.210 
have some variety in the beta it seems
like<00:02:43.410> they've<00:02:43.560> taken<00:02:43.590> away<00:02:44.010> some<00:02:44.190> stuff

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
like they've taken away some stuff

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.860 
like they've taken away some stuff
because<00:02:44.580> maybe<00:02:45.090> they're<00:02:45.270> still<00:02:45.480> making<00:02:45.630> some

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
because maybe they're still making some

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.020 
because maybe they're still making some
items<00:02:46.200> maybe<00:02:46.590> they're<00:02:46.800> still<00:02:47.010> doing<00:02:47.730> some

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
items maybe they're still doing some

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.009 
items maybe they're still doing some
sort<00:02:48.300> of<00:02:48.390> stuff<00:02:48.570> and<00:02:48.630> they<00:02:48.720> don't<00:02:48.750> want<00:02:48.959> to

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
sort of stuff and they don't want to

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.600 
sort of stuff and they don't want to
give<00:02:49.110> everything<00:02:49.350> away<00:02:49.530> just<00:02:50.220> like<00:02:50.340> how<00:02:50.430> they

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
give everything away just like how they

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:51.590 
give everything away just like how they
don't<00:02:50.880> have<00:02:51.030> every<00:02:51.239> single<00:02:51.450> character

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
don't have every single character

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.229 
don't have every single character
available<00:02:52.320> to<00:02:52.739> play<00:02:52.980> right<00:02:53.610> as<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:53.940> go<00:02:54.090> into

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
available to play right as you go into

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.040 
available to play right as you go into
the<00:02:54.420> beta<00:02:55.310> but<00:02:56.310> yeah<00:02:56.519> the<00:02:57.510> character<00:02:57.900> roster

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
the beta but yeah the character roster

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.350 
the beta but yeah the character roster
so<00:02:58.800> far<00:02:59.040> we're<00:02:59.519> obviously<00:02:59.700> not<00:02:59.940> seeing<00:03:00.239> the

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
so far we're obviously not seeing the

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.840 
so far we're obviously not seeing the
huge<00:03:01.110> character<00:03:01.380> roster<00:03:01.620> that<00:03:02.250> we<00:03:02.400> wanted<00:03:02.730> it

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
huge character roster that we wanted it

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.160 
huge character roster that we wanted it
doesn't<00:03:03.120> seem<00:03:03.480> like<00:03:03.660> they're<00:03:03.810> gonna<00:03:03.900> either

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
doesn't seem like they're gonna either

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.410 
doesn't seem like they're gonna either
show<00:03:04.410> everything<00:03:05.130> or<00:03:05.310> they're<00:03:05.760> just<00:03:06.060> showing

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
show everything or they're just showing

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.140 
show everything or they're just showing
everything<00:03:06.840> in<00:03:06.930> those<00:03:07.050> block<00:03:07.709> slots<00:03:08.069> and<00:03:08.519> yeah

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
everything in those block slots and yeah

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.090 
everything in those block slots and yeah
I'm<00:03:09.750> not<00:03:09.959> really<00:03:09.989> sure<00:03:10.350> if<00:03:10.500> that's<00:03:10.680> really

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
I'm not really sure if that's really

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.729 
I'm not really sure if that's really
that<00:03:12.060> like<00:03:12.360> what<00:03:12.630> actually<00:03:13.200> is<00:03:13.260> going<00:03:13.290> on<00:03:13.590> with

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
that like what actually is going on with

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.259 
that like what actually is going on with
that<00:03:13.769> if<00:03:14.100> they<00:03:14.280> actually<00:03:14.519> are<00:03:14.910> gonna<00:03:15.060> have

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
that if they actually are gonna have

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.259 
that if they actually are gonna have
more<00:03:15.540> than<00:03:15.720> like<00:03:15.900> I<00:03:16.310> would<00:03:17.310> say<00:03:17.489> more<00:03:17.760> than<00:03:17.790> 60

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
more than like I would say more than 60

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.000 
more than like I would say more than 60
characters<00:03:18.660> as<00:03:18.810> I<00:03:18.930> said<00:03:19.140> I<00:03:19.290> said<00:03:19.650> this<00:03:19.739> a<00:03:19.799> while

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
characters as I said I said this a while

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.009 
characters as I said I said this a while
ago<00:03:20.040> 60<00:03:20.610> characters<00:03:20.970> over<00:03:21.090> that<00:03:21.329> for<00:03:21.540> me<00:03:21.630> it's

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
ago 60 characters over that for me it's

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.300 
ago 60 characters over that for me it's
fine<00:03:22.260> because<00:03:22.620> apparently<00:03:23.010> they're<00:03:23.220> gonna

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
fine because apparently they're gonna

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.280 
fine because apparently they're gonna
actually<00:03:23.519> have<00:03:23.790> quite<00:03:24.299> a<00:03:24.329> few<00:03:24.480> slots<00:03:24.930> for<00:03:25.200> you

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
actually have quite a few slots for you

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.620 
actually have quite a few slots for you
to<00:03:25.380> make<00:03:25.530> hero<00:03:25.799> characters<00:03:26.280> so<00:03:26.970> I<00:03:27.000> think<00:03:27.329> that

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
to make hero characters so I think that

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.410 
to make hero characters so I think that
that's<00:03:27.930> fine<00:03:28.440> so<00:03:28.920> I<00:03:29.190> will<00:03:29.880> see<00:03:30.090> if<00:03:30.239> that

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
that's fine so I will see if that

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.750 
that's fine so I will see if that
actually<00:03:30.570> works<00:03:30.900> out<00:03:31.079> um<00:03:31.799> a<00:03:32.220> lot<00:03:32.400> of<00:03:32.489> people

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
actually works out um a lot of people

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.090 
actually works out um a lot of people

lot of you or some people are still
skeptical<00:04:12.600> on<00:04:12.930> if<00:04:13.109> freezes<00:04:13.769> races<00:04:14.070> will<00:04:14.220> be

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
skeptical on if freezes races will be

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.279 
skeptical on if freezes races will be
playable<00:04:14.640> in<00:04:14.880> xenoverse<00:04:15.209> well<00:04:15.570> there<00:04:16.109> was

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
playable in xenoverse well there was

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.949 
playable in xenoverse well there was
also<00:04:16.560> a<00:04:16.739> extended<00:04:17.700> trailer<00:04:18.030> that<00:04:18.510> came<00:04:18.780> out

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
also a extended trailer that came out

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.750 
also a extended trailer that came out
yesterday<00:04:19.169> that<00:04:19.410> was<00:04:19.739> showing<00:04:20.130> gameplay<00:04:20.519> of

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
yesterday that was showing gameplay of

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.680 
yesterday that was showing gameplay of
you<00:04:21.209> playing<00:04:21.450> as<00:04:21.720> one<00:04:22.500> of<00:04:22.560> freezes<00:04:23.390> race

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
you playing as one of freezes race

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.890 
you playing as one of freezes race
so<00:04:24.900> you<00:04:25.020> could<00:04:25.440> actually<00:04:25.590> create<00:04:25.890> a<00:04:25.979> character

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
so you could actually create a character

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.629 
so you could actually create a character
with<00:04:27.020> that<00:04:27.229> it's<00:04:27.590> pretty<00:04:28.009> much<00:04:28.220> confirmed

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
with that it's pretty much confirmed

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:29.890 
with that it's pretty much confirmed
because<00:04:28.850> that<00:04:29.000> they<00:04:29.210> literally<00:04:29.479> put<00:04:29.600> it<00:04:29.750> in

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
because that they literally put it in

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.810 
because that they literally put it in
the<00:04:29.960> trailer<00:04:30.199> of<00:04:30.440> you<00:04:30.560> fighting<00:04:31.190> as<00:04:31.400> that

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
the trailer of you fighting as that

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.700 
the trailer of you fighting as that
character<00:04:32.270> so<00:04:32.509> I<00:04:32.720> think<00:04:32.960> that's<00:04:33.259> pretty<00:04:33.440> cool

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
character so I think that's pretty cool

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.129 
character so I think that's pretty cool
and<00:04:33.949> I<00:04:34.490> can't<00:04:34.790> wait<00:04:34.910> to<00:04:35.060> actually<00:04:35.300> play<00:04:35.990> as

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:36.139 
and I can't wait to actually play as

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:37.950 
and I can't wait to actually play as
that<00:04:36.169> and<00:04:36.560> see<00:04:36.710> how<00:04:36.830> that<00:04:36.889> really<00:04:37.220> goes<00:04:37.430> so

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
that and see how that really goes so

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.330 
that and see how that really goes so

think<00:04:43.639> that<00:04:43.910> xenoverse<00:04:44.330> was<00:04:44.509> a<00:04:44.539> little<00:04:44.690> bit

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
think that xenoverse was a little bit

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.960 
think that xenoverse was a little bit
too<00:04:44.960> clunky<00:04:45.770> for<00:04:46.160> you<00:04:46.280> do<00:04:46.520> you<00:04:46.610> think<00:04:46.850> it<00:04:46.940> looks

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
too clunky for you do you think it looks

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.480 
too clunky for you do you think it looks
great<00:04:47.389> do<00:04:47.990> you<00:04:48.050> think<00:04:48.320> it<00:04:48.410> looks<00:04:48.590> a<00:04:48.860> little<00:04:49.250> bit

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
great do you think it looks a little bit

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.070 
great do you think it looks a little bit
tough<00:04:49.850> to<00:04:50.090> actually<00:04:50.360> get<00:04:50.660> a<00:04:50.690> lot<00:04:50.840> of<00:04:50.900> people

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
tough to actually get a lot of people

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.390 
tough to actually get a lot of people
have<00:04:51.169> said<00:04:51.410> that<00:04:51.710> the<00:04:51.800> controls<00:04:52.160> are<00:04:52.310> actually

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
have said that the controls are actually

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.950 
have said that the controls are actually
really<00:04:52.729> hard<00:04:52.970> to<00:04:53.060> get<00:04:53.180> used<00:04:53.419> to<00:04:53.600> and<00:04:53.720> it's<00:04:53.810> not

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
really hard to get used to and it's not

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.420 
really hard to get used to and it's not
really<00:04:54.110> simple<00:04:54.410> like<00:04:55.039> every<00:04:55.310> other

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
really simple like every other

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.790 
really simple like every other
Dragonball<00:04:55.970> game<00:04:56.180> which<00:04:56.389> kind<00:04:57.020> of<00:04:57.169> piques<00:04:57.680> our

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
Dragonball game which kind of piques our

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.050 
Dragonball game which kind of piques our
interest<00:04:57.860> because<00:04:58.370> maybe<00:04:58.669> they're<00:04:58.910> actually

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
interest because maybe they're actually

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.689 
interest because maybe they're actually
trying<00:04:59.449> to<00:04:59.539> make<00:04:59.720> it<00:04:59.949> somewhat<00:05:00.949> competitive

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:01.699 
trying to make it somewhat competitive

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:03.129 
trying to make it somewhat competitive
I'm<00:05:01.910> not<00:05:02.090> really<00:05:02.210> sure<00:05:02.510> they<00:05:02.750> might<00:05:02.930> actually

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.139 
I'm not really sure they might actually

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:04.740 
I'm not really sure they might actually
be<00:05:03.320> trying<00:05:03.590> to<00:05:03.650> do<00:05:03.770> that<00:05:03.919> with<00:05:03.979> Dragon<00:05:04.430> Ball

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
be trying to do that with Dragon Ball

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.939 
be trying to do that with Dragon Ball
and<00:05:05.750> they<00:05:05.900> are<00:05:06.080> then<00:05:06.470> they're<00:05:06.620> making<00:05:06.740> the

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:06.949 
and they are then they're making the

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:08.350 
and they are then they're making the
controls<00:05:07.310> somewhat<00:05:07.610> difficult<00:05:07.789> to<00:05:08.120> actually

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
controls somewhat difficult to actually

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.540 
controls somewhat difficult to actually
nail<00:05:08.720> off<00:05:08.900> so<00:05:09.110> that<00:05:09.260> that's<00:05:09.740> probably<00:05:09.979> why<00:05:10.220> all

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
nail off so that that's probably why all

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.159 
nail off so that that's probably why all
the<00:05:10.729> games<00:05:10.880> that<00:05:11.030> we<00:05:11.150> seen<00:05:11.360> till<00:05:11.720> now<00:05:11.900> is

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
the games that we seen till now is

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:13.570 
the games that we seen till now is
pretty<00:05:12.500> clunky<00:05:12.710> and<00:05:12.979> nobody's<00:05:13.280> gotten<00:05:13.490> an

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
pretty clunky and nobody's gotten an

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.420 
pretty clunky and nobody's gotten an
actual<00:05:13.820> chance<00:05:14.060> to<00:05:14.650> practice<00:05:15.650> and<00:05:15.889> game<00:05:16.160> which

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
actual chance to practice and game which

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.010 
actual chance to practice and game which
would<00:05:16.669> make<00:05:16.820> a<00:05:16.850> lot<00:05:17.030> of<00:05:17.150> sense<00:05:17.389> but<00:05:17.780> I'm<00:05:17.900> not

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
would make a lot of sense but I'm not

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.600 
would make a lot of sense but I'm not
really<00:05:18.139> sure<00:05:18.349> if<00:05:18.440> that's<00:05:18.620> it<00:05:18.830> or<00:05:19.039> if<00:05:19.220> it's<00:05:19.400> just

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
really sure if that's it or if it's just

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.430 
really sure if that's it or if it's just
that<00:05:19.699> people<00:05:19.910> having<00:05:20.570> gotten<00:05:20.720> used<00:05:20.930> to<00:05:21.020> it<00:05:21.229> or

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
that people having gotten used to it or

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.680 
that people having gotten used to it or
what<00:05:22.010> so<00:05:22.340> how<00:05:22.760> much<00:05:22.880> you<00:05:23.030> guys<00:05:23.150> think<00:05:23.479> any<00:05:23.660> of
