 Geraniums are fast-growing plants, from which it is possible to draw cuttings that root easily 

00:00:22.414 --> 00:00:28.414
 Such cuttings should be prepared in autumn and then protected, so as to have plants already well developed in spring 

00:00:30.594 --> 00:00:37.594
 but it is also possible to prepare geranium cuttings in spring, taking them from newly purchased new plants 

00:00:40.055 --> 00:00:47.055
 We proceed by preparing some small vases, filled with a good universal soil, lightened with washed river sand 

00:01:18.617 --> 00:01:28.617
 Therefore, with the sharp and clean shears, the apices of the geranium branches are removed, 7-10 cm long, choosing those that do not carry flowers 

00:01:42.721 --> 00:01:50.720
 From these small branches the vegetative apexes are removed, and with the fingers all the leaves are removed in the lower two thirds of the cutting 

00:02:04.577 --> 00:02:12.580
 At this point with a grafting knife, or even with the shears, we cut the lower part obliquely, so as to obtain a sort of point 

00:02:13.582 --> 00:02:18.580
 this tip will be immersed in the rooting hormone and then inserted into the soil 

00:03:22.523 --> 00:03:28.520
 These jars are placed in a saucer and watered, in order to moisten the growing substrate well
