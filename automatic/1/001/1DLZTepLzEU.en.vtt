napkins what I'm going to do here is I'm

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.679 
napkins what I'm going to do here is I'm
going<00:00:19.160> to<00:00:19.279> try<00:00:19.490> and<00:00:19.610> salvage<00:00:19.849> something<00:00:20.360> that

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
going to try and salvage something that

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:22.570 
going to try and salvage something that
went<00:00:20.840> terribly<00:00:21.230> wrong<00:00:21.349> on<00:00:21.710> me<00:00:21.860> so<00:00:22.070> this<00:00:22.250> is<00:00:22.430> an

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
went terribly wrong on me so this is an

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.999 
went terribly wrong on me so this is an
old<00:00:22.760> canvas<00:00:23.480> but<00:00:23.779> I'm<00:00:23.989> just<00:00:24.410> hold<00:00:24.710> everything

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:25.009 
old canvas but I'm just hold everything

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.659 
old canvas but I'm just hold everything
up

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:25.669 
up

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:27.760 
up
and<00:00:26.060> rather<00:00:26.270> than<00:00:26.480> dump<00:00:26.930> that<00:00:27.110> I've<00:00:27.380> decided

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:27.770 
and rather than dump that I've decided

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.589 
and rather than dump that I've decided
to<00:00:28.040> try<00:00:28.340> and<00:00:28.430> make<00:00:28.489> something<00:00:28.820> just<00:00:28.970> left<00:00:29.419> me

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
to try and make something just left me

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:31.330 
to try and make something just left me
with<00:00:29.750> the<00:00:29.869> top<00:00:30.050> flight<00:00:30.349> and<00:00:30.590> the<00:00:30.770> two<00:00:30.919> bottom

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
with the top flight and the two bottom

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.370 
with the top flight and the two bottom
ones<00:00:31.369> don't<00:00:32.119> discard<00:00:32.630> these<00:00:32.930> because<00:00:33.200> we'll

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
ones don't discard these because we'll

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.130 
ones don't discard these because we'll
do<00:00:33.500> another<00:00:33.680> project<00:00:34.010> for<00:00:34.399> those<00:00:34.780> so<00:00:35.780> what<00:00:35.960> you

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
do another project for those so what you

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.560 
do another project for those so what you
do<00:00:36.290> basically<00:00:36.560> is<00:00:36.950> this<00:00:37.309> is<00:00:37.489> beautiful<00:00:37.760> one<00:00:38.329> of

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
do basically is this is beautiful one of

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.120 
do basically is this is beautiful one of
puppies<00:00:39.079> and<00:00:39.350> a<00:00:39.500> bird<00:00:39.739> and<00:00:41.320> what<00:00:42.320> I<00:00:42.380> do<00:00:42.590> is<00:00:42.980> I

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.130 
puppies and a bird and what I do is I

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.980 
puppies and a bird and what I do is I
kind<00:00:43.340> of<00:00:43.550> tear<00:00:43.790> it<00:00:44.000> down<00:00:44.800> for<00:00:45.800> closers<00:00:46.990> and

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:47.990 
kind of tear it down for closers and

take off the pieces that you want you

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.380 
take off the pieces that you want you
don't<00:00:51.770> have<00:00:51.920> to<00:00:52.160> be<00:00:52.250> terribly<00:00:52.460> fussy<00:00:53.150> now<00:00:53.300> I've

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
don't have to be terribly fussy now I've

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.300 
don't have to be terribly fussy now I've
just<00:00:53.450> roughly<00:00:53.930> cutting<00:00:54.590> around<00:00:54.710> this<00:00:55.040> bird

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:55.310 
just roughly cutting around this bird

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:03.450 
just roughly cutting around this bird
here<00:00:55.660> and<00:00:56.660> I<00:00:56.960> leave<00:00:57.170> some<00:00:57.560> of<00:00:57.770> the<00:00:58.990> puppies<00:00:59.990> on

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.940 

there's<00:01:04.460> no<00:01:04.640> real<00:01:05.119> rhyme<00:01:05.570> or<00:01:05.600> reason<00:01:06.140> that

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
there's no real rhyme or reason that

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.069 
there's no real rhyme or reason that
this<00:01:07.369> technique<00:01:07.820> is<00:01:08.090> just<00:01:08.360> go<00:01:08.630> with<00:01:08.780> the<00:01:08.869> flow

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:09.079 
this technique is just go with the flow

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:11.289 
this technique is just go with the flow
and<00:01:09.259> see<00:01:09.320> what's<00:01:09.650> your<00:01:09.829> end<00:01:10.009> office<00:01:10.340> so<00:01:11.060> here

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
and see what's your end office so here

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.870 
and see what's your end office so here
would<00:01:11.450> say<00:01:11.509> I<00:01:11.689> have<00:01:11.929> this<00:01:12.649> little<00:01:12.859> piece<00:01:13.189> and

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
would say I have this little piece and

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.289 
would say I have this little piece and
the<00:01:14.509> technique<00:01:14.960> is<00:01:15.229> now<00:01:16.069> I'm<00:01:16.310> using<00:01:16.609> Mod<00:01:17.030> Podge

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
the technique is now I'm using Mod Podge

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.969 
the technique is now I'm using Mod Podge
but<00:01:18.020> you<00:01:18.170> can<00:01:18.439> use<00:01:18.710> half<00:01:19.310> PVA<00:01:19.999> half<00:01:20.630> and<00:01:21.229> water

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
but you can use half PVA half and water

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.980 
but you can use half PVA half and water
and<00:01:22.429> you<00:01:23.149> paint<00:01:23.509> a<00:01:23.889> generous<00:01:24.889> amount<00:01:25.159> of<00:01:25.429> it

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
and you paint a generous amount of it

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.840 
and you paint a generous amount of it
onto<00:01:26.990> the<00:01:27.200> surface<00:01:27.530> of<00:01:27.950> the<00:01:28.039> canvas<00:01:29.409> and<00:01:30.789> I<00:01:31.789> do

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
onto the surface of the canvas and I do

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.450 
onto the surface of the canvas and I do
recommend<00:01:32.539> working<00:01:32.990> in<00:01:33.350> small<00:01:33.710> areas<00:01:34.009> at<00:01:34.429> a

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
recommend working in small areas at a

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.209 
recommend working in small areas at a
time<00:01:34.819> rather<00:01:35.719> than<00:01:36.139> you<00:01:36.619> know<00:01:36.649> putting<00:01:37.069> a

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:37.219 
time rather than you know putting a

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:39.120 
time rather than you know putting a
whole<00:01:37.399> load<00:01:37.609> of<00:01:37.639> you<00:01:37.969> on<00:01:38.179> at<00:01:38.420> once

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
whole load of you on at once

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.559 
whole load of you on at once
so<00:01:40.130> here<00:01:40.369> we<00:01:40.490> go<00:01:40.609> I<00:01:40.639> have<00:01:40.759> a<00:01:40.850> generous<00:01:41.270> amount

00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:41.569 
so here we go I have a generous amount

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:45.309 
so here we go I have a generous amount
down<00:01:41.959> and<00:01:42.340> then<00:01:43.340> you<00:01:44.119> take<00:01:44.420> your<00:01:44.810> piece<00:01:45.079> of

00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:45.319 
down and then you take your piece of

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:47.349 
down and then you take your piece of
napkin<00:01:45.770> and<00:01:46.280> you<00:01:46.340> place<00:01:46.700> it<00:01:46.909> where<00:01:47.030> you<00:01:47.060> want

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:47.359 
napkin and you place it where you want

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:51.160 
napkin and you place it where you want
us<00:01:47.539> and<00:01:48.139> again<00:01:48.469> just<00:01:48.770> from<00:01:49.189> the<00:01:49.399> center<00:01:50.170> pull

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
us and again just from the center pull

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.590 
us and again just from the center pull
out<00:01:51.319> any<00:01:51.679> air<00:01:51.979> bubbles<00:01:52.429> that<00:01:52.759> might<00:01:53.539> be

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
out any air bubbles that might be

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:00.330 
out any air bubbles that might be
trapped<00:01:53.990> underneath<00:01:54.439> the<00:01:54.799> the<00:01:56.020> paper<00:01:57.020> napkin

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.070 

like<00:02:01.340> that

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.730 

and<00:02:06.170> then<00:02:06.860> go<00:02:07.010> wanna<00:02:07.190> find<00:02:07.580> another<00:02:08.030> piece<00:02:08.740> now

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
and then go wanna find another piece now

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.830 
and then go wanna find another piece now
I<00:02:09.770> want<00:02:10.190> to<00:02:10.250> try<00:02:10.490> and<00:02:10.610> mix<00:02:10.790> my<00:02:11.090> colors<00:02:11.120> because

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
one of my my napkins is distinctively

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.960 
one of my my napkins is distinctively
blue<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.560> other<00:02:15.650> is<00:02:15.890> distinctively<00:02:16.550> kind

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
blue and the other is distinctively kind

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.480 

you

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.160 

now<00:02:32.490> you<00:02:32.550> are<00:02:32.880> going<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.330> end<00:02:33.510> up<00:02:33.690> with<00:02:33.870> gaps

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
now you are going to end up with gaps

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.140 
now you are going to end up with gaps
but<00:02:35.160> don't<00:02:35.370> worry<00:02:35.580> about<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:36.030> gaps<00:02:36.240> because

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
but don't worry about the gaps because

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.390 
but don't worry about the gaps because
we<00:02:39.150> can<00:02:39.360> fill<00:02:39.600> in<00:02:39.750> those<00:02:39.960> with<00:02:40.260> tiny<00:02:40.560> pieces<00:02:41.160> of

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
we can fill in those with tiny pieces of
