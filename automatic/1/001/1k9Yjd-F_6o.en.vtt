00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.970
 policies declared sarah this and this is 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.970
 life is not pink 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.570
 so let's touch on a topic that I have 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.000
 asked a lot in the previous videos and 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.170
 which is one of the most searched in google 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.710
 because men are afraid of 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.450
 commitment 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.730
 we are talking about commitment as 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.369
 be involved in a relationship of 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.380
 a lot of time with a person who is 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.119
 devote in body and soul only to 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.400
 she not necessarily of marriage 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.640
 according to rolando goycochea author of without 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.230
 fear of love 90% of people in 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.170
 general we are afraid of commitment 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.850
 it's a pretty big figure that is 9 of 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.290
 every 10 people we have something of 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.090
 fear of being committed to a 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.620
 person in body and soul the reasons for 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.410
 we can feel this fear are 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.910
 many many from from fear to 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.430
 Failure to break our hearts 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.050
 fear of pain fear of being left alone 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.880
 fear of not meeting our expectations 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.340
 or the expectations of our partner or 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.110
 social expectations the reality is 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.610
 that everyone scares us a little bit 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.160
 scared but men have a 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.230
 tendency to make it appear that they 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.300
 they have more panic to compromise than 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.009
 then we are going to ask 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.450
 the kids on the street what is it 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:08.450
 they think about it they accompany me 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:16.770
 it would be fantastic clear if you feel like 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.170
 that the dream of each person does not have to 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.640
 someone next to you not for you 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:27.950
 support the good and the bad by 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.950
 course as all I'm married sector 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.909
 I do not like commitment very much and this 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.470
 when you ask for marriage is 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.049
 when the man says son 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.320
 you need in you I am ready even that 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:45.200
 but this one and most of it ends 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.710
 but marrying late in the 30 to 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.630
 up I think that because of the lack of 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.759
 values ​​in society I do not know about the 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.310
 men who flee to women because 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.690
 they feel that they tie them or it's like 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.729
 they no longer have the freedom they are going to have 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.130
 when they are free, maybe not because 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.399
 experience for the reality not Indians and 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.690
 there are 200 300 years of history 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:08.060
 generations grandmothers talking moms 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.330
 with the daughters the reality always the 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.819
 men have a little fear of losing 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.050
 freedom and the woman simply to a 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.120
 commitment 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.769
 maybe anatomically work from a 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.620
 man leaves love and the woman receives it 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.150
 that's because I think it's really not that 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.730
 be afraid of commitment but to the 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.590
 lack of some man's capacity 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.900
 to be with them and cope 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.090
 relationships I do not think it's more 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.769
 prosecuted to our times that everything 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.190
 is too busy and with 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:39.980
 very many this 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.690
 occupations to attend that really 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.610
 sees in the background a commitment a 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.770
 commitment of these dimensions the 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.330
 true girls I think men 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.830
 just as we are also 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.900
 looking for a relationship they also want 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.490
 fall in love and if they want to end their life 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.530
 with a stable partner you already know in 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.420
 scene of the 80 years grabbed by the 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.560
 hand here and from our producer we 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.570
 just give a pretty theory 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.130
 interesting about why it may be that 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.140
 it seems that men have more 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.520
 fear of commitment to us women 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.020
 we have a biological clock that we 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.090
 it starts to be tic tac tic tac tic tac 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.740
 before them because good we 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.270
 we have a time constraint for 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.340
 have children and they can reach the 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.700
 60 years and start forming a family 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.440
 then they do not have this pressure 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.000
 biological and social to find a 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.890
 person with whom they want to settle 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.510
 quickly and we feel the 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.950
 already need to run him and they 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.840
 You can take a few more years up 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.670
 find the right person now me 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.890
 I think that in this lies the fear of everything 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.410
 world find the right person 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:37.370
 according to author goycochea 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:39.319
 we need to have 79 attempts in life 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.810
 before finding love 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:44.329
 and thus leave criticism if it has started at 20 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.579
 or 30 subjects in their quiet life just 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:48.530
 they go to the middle of the way 79 before 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.879
 find the ideal couple then the 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.620
 very good men are taking their 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:53.870
 time is not that you are afraid is that 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.879
 they go slowly I am that will touch this and 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.989
