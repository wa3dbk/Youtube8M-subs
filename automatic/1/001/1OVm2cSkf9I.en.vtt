00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:31.439
 The video I'm talking about now is a 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.790
 fast cookie a well used link from the kitchen 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.860
 rock'n'roll folks actually 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.989
 I believe that any drummer capable of 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.410
 use in any style that is very 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.300
 used for endings of songs or excerpts 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.590
 I can even name a few. 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.360
 examples for example this piece which 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.829
 I was playing at the beginning and it's a 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:01:01.230
 introduction of a twisted song 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:01:06.030
 sisters is the name that will and effects 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.860
 which is another piece that I because 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.610
 I played was also from the end of a 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.439
 World Music 11 Kiss Songs 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.060
 Acoustic them that I did the year with 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.060
 music but stayed in my head olic 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:25.049
 are quite used this is some 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.229
 Sometimes the long guy was a bit 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.229
 direct 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:42.930
 has two versions with two basses and 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:44.550
 two butt touches but the focus here 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.340
 will be with the simple pedal 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.960
 is another well-known song that 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.590
 plays a very good role with Travis Baker 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.840
 of play and blink brink an environment 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:06.899
 And they in that girl they burst 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:08.310
 that to the bad ones then several students 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:13.800
 asked about this song how the 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:16.050
 Man , what do you do, the guys you're doing? 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.180
 do with the hand only with the hand but it's cool 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:22.200
 use of the foot because the effect is so cool 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.900
 because it gives that sharp effect 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.080
 severe downward so then you go to 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.959
 box tone that is a bit more serious 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:33.620
 from the south after the butt is the 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.840
 mechanics is like this 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:40.459
 only that everything is not 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.459
 it's all after 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.410
 The more I could play these notes 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.930
 close to the butt tighten more 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.829
 will give a quick effect right 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.150
 but that's it I drew the little shepherd 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:59.730
 to give some help 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.530
 here it is even those who can not read 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.720
 scores that will then help so the 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.720
 good note already start the training by playing 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.180
 World's First's there after the way 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.630
 box with the right hand 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.180
 2 tone with your left hand and again 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.230
 right hand 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.700
 usually the effect I did here I 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.870
 I started the opposite, I started with the hand 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.180
 but then comes the butt 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.799
 only beach for the training question. 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.989
 people will train with a time boom 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.940
 because the idea is not where to start 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.730
 the phrase by hand is knowing where to end 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.500
 the bass drum usually ends in time is the 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.180
 bouquet was going to be the determining 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.769
 its time so let's suppose that 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.989
 no drummers and want to use it for 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.670
 me is a start to call the band by 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.209
 example if the guy to start with 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.209
 example 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.230
 the end of music is not 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.500
 google is in time it's like i 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.500
 were you cop 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:14.090
 google continues in this place there is a 1 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:23.300
 only before this one I put these 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:24.920
 hand notes badÃ¡ of a butt 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.810
 that the more you know how to touch the hand, 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.780
 give the effect only fit the hand slows down 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:40.220
 It's not even so funny, is not it? 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:42.470
 the government also if I do not even know 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.490
 Remember the group is speeding up the time 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.490
 that I'm going to lay hands on the 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:55.590
 where the closer but will it go 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.600
 The quick effect is obviously 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.550
 start as I said people will book 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.320
 so the time in the robbery 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.210
 I recommend putting the subway on the team, I do not 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.430
 I'm going to put water on the subway in the subway train. 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.979
 natural here on foot 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:12.180
 then places the metronome and marking 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:15.419
 kick on over time then the album ok 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:18.960
 Ok, that's right, you can put a 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:23.340
 third or three-note sixteenth note 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:25.320
 it's three notes half time then no and you 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:30.600
 begin to make the phrase by hand will not 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:32.160
 stay here here that will enter the 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.490
 What are you going to get your hands on to do this? 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.490
 right here 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:40.070
 but first let's determine the time in the 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:42.780
 then select the subway in the 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:45.120
 keep the time firm when I spoke 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.460
 important album is okay then 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:55.850
 the box goes exactly in and will not go 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:58.789
 together with 12 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:02.389
 now you have to fit the other notes 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:02.389
 in this space that 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.780
 google continues to be loyal 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.840
 who stays in the same place 

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:36.090
 Like I said, I do not even need 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.659
 accelerate google can accelerate the ideal 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.659
 same effect 

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:47.340
 after casting can be 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.240
 I can use this time a song 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:52.949
 slow 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:54.389
 only then instead of playing with 

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:56.699
 enough space 

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:59.060
 I 'm almost at the time of our bumba. 

00:06:56.699 --> 00:06:59.060
 hands 

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:09.479
 only never here 

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:13.080
 In fact, the normal thing is I started to 

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:14.729
 to notice some deafness along with good read 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:21.060
 then do the opposite when I started 

00:07:14.729 --> 00:07:24.150
 Touching this I said so is a case. 

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:25.919
 each chaton an absurd this effect and 

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:28.590
 almost just because they continue to 

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:31.349
 do not close there that legal ladder that is the 

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:33.210
 the most serious end up seeing the 

00:07:31.349 --> 00:07:36.000
 deaf sounding that is not what people 

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:42.449
 either the 20 kelvin the bass ending and 

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:43.800
 I did not have enough difficulty in 

00:07:42.449 --> 00:07:47.819
 learn this when I was starting to 

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:50.460
 pick up the suggestion as I said 

00:07:47.819 --> 00:07:53.000
 tom and deaf box but you can use 

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:53.000
 any place 

00:07:55.189 --> 00:07:58.699
 including the same part 

00:08:08.199 --> 00:08:14.300
 sure this was done the tip of day 3 

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:16.720
 quite smooth more links out there 

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.720
 a big hug
