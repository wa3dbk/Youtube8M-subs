sci-fi<00:00:53.809> I<00:00:54.379> was<00:00:54.680> expecting<00:00:55.160> more<00:00:55.280> of<00:00:55.430> an

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
sci-fi I was expecting more of an

sci-fi I was expecting more of an
explanation<00:00:55.910> and<00:00:56.420> it<00:00:56.570> is<00:00:56.840> very<00:00:57.199> hard<00:00:57.530> to<00:00:57.649> get

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
explanation and it is very hard to get

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.759 
explanation and it is very hard to get
into<00:00:58.520> the<00:00:58.670> show<00:00:58.940> the<00:00:59.449> pilot<00:00:59.660> episode<00:00:59.930> is<00:01:00.410> a

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
into the show the pilot episode is a

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.520 
into the show the pilot episode is a
slow<00:01:01.340> burn<00:01:01.699> and<00:01:01.969> it's<00:01:02.090> definitely<00:01:02.539> not<00:01:03.440> the

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
slow burn and it's definitely not the

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.920 
slow burn and it's definitely not the
best<00:01:03.649> episode<00:01:04.129> of<00:01:04.309> the<00:01:04.879> season<00:01:05.120> once<00:01:05.690> you<00:01:05.810> get

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
can be really overdramatic and cheesy at

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.170 
can be really overdramatic and cheesy at
times<00:04:22.260> as<00:04:22.500> well<00:04:22.710> which<00:04:22.950> is<00:04:22.980> what<00:04:23.400> I<00:04:23.460> have<00:04:23.700> most

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
really invested in the characters and

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.820 
really invested in the characters and

and just sort of go back into that world

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.240
