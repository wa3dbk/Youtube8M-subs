regulator<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:37.280> suggest<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:39.150> just

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
regulator I suggest that you just

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.520 
regulator I suggest that you just
replace<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.870> whole<00:00:40.019> thing<00:00:40.290> because<00:00:40.470> you

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
replace the whole thing because you

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.600 
replace the whole thing because you
don't<00:00:40.680> wanna<00:00:40.799> have<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:40.949> come<00:00:41.129> back<00:00:41.309> in<00:00:41.460> here

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:57.089 
cleaned up by asbestos it could be for

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:59.380 
cleaned up by asbestos it could be for
now<00:00:57.210> until<00:00:57.449> we<00:00:57.600> actually<00:00:57.960> start<00:00:58.339> reassembly

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
now until we actually start reassembly

all right so we're still going to have a
check<00:03:01.660> engine<00:03:01.690> code<00:03:02.230> I<00:03:02.530> need<00:03:03.099> to<00:03:03.459> still

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
check engine code I need to still

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.750 
check engine code I need to still
replace<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.360> o2<00:03:04.540> sensors<00:03:05.170> and<00:03:06.069> the<00:03:06.280> catalytic

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
replace the o2 sensors and the catalytic

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.330 
replace the o2 sensors and the catalytic
converter<00:03:07.590> they<00:03:08.590> have<00:03:08.739> been<00:03:08.890> doing<00:03:09.040> this<00:03:09.280> for

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
converter they have been doing this for

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.210 
converter they have been doing this for
quite<00:03:09.580> a<00:03:09.700> while<00:03:09.910> so<00:03:09.970> it<00:03:10.540> ate<00:03:10.750> up<00:03:10.900> all<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.830> o2

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
quite a while so it ate up all the o2

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.979 
quite a while so it ate up all the o2
sensors<00:03:12.640> and<00:03:12.849> also<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.269> cat<00:03:13.500> burned<00:03:14.500> them<00:03:14.650> out

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
sensors and also the cat burned them out

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.509 
sensors and also the cat burned them out
but<00:03:16.989> as<00:03:17.200> you<00:03:17.319> can<00:03:17.500> see<00:03:17.709> the<00:03:17.980> aisles<00:03:18.340> not

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
suggest after you let it run for a

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.900 
suggest after you let it run for a
little<00:04:12.440> while<00:04:12.590> so<00:04:12.890> on<00:04:13.010> and<00:04:13.130> so<00:04:13.250> forth

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
go back check all your bolts go around

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.590 
go back check all your bolts go around
the<00:04:16.340> whole<00:04:16.459> thing<00:04:16.730> go<00:04:16.970> ahead<00:04:17.030> retighten<00:04:17.540> them

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
the whole thing go ahead retighten them

the whole thing go ahead retighten them
again<00:04:17.840> the<00:04:18.019> same<00:04:18.200> pattern<00:04:18.410> evenly<00:04:19.040> well

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
again the same pattern evenly well

again the same pattern evenly well
you're<00:04:19.580> not<00:04:19.640> tightening<00:04:20.030> it<00:04:20.090> all<00:04:20.150> down<00:04:20.330> at<00:04:20.510> one

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
you're not tightening it all down at one
