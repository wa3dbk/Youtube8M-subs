00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.040
 hi guys i'm joined lopes where 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.619
 instructors here anything gilvan I give 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.900
 level 3 course and I'll give you a tip 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.699
 about the script learn a sketch 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.550
 easiest way to learn the sport 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.529
 are you isolating the steps that this 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.750
 movement has for example when you 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.609
 try to do a sport and already try to do 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.660
 the whole movement is more difficult to 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.910
 develop 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.280
 but you have in part by part 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.210
 for example 'write' what 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.210
 he calls tilkian 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.530
 I already try to face this 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.600
 movement is difficult then what we 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:50.550
 can do the training first move 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.800
 of the left hand and the simple you have to 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.660
 to be precise about something that leaves the 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.340
 Beautiful writing and precision how much more 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.570
 I need you to make a better move. 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.079
 after training the hand that is in the 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.670
 Facebook 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.040
 then it will be harder for her to 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:10.350
 have to be faster are two clix 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.240
 I give in the end pleads April when 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.280
 you're born here you can leave 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.180
 So you do not have to make a move here. 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.049
 is here 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.159
 at the same time you loop the sound 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:24.680
 leaving beijing 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:27.750
 the training only this from here only the right hand 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.609
 then I come already slow trains one 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.890
 important thing do not always write 

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:34.409
 start slow you will want to accelerate 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.990
 but you have to have the patience of trying to 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.700
 wagah sometimes even as a turntable 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.530
 off the same disk, go ahead I 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:47.850
 two cuts 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:49.469
 the disk comes back from two force one 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:56.159
 in time you will be able to do 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:57.959
 this but quickly sure this tip that 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.700
 I have to give it today, I got connected to it. 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:01.700
