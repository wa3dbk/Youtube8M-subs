 cali colombia reminds us how it started 

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:02.589
 in soccer I always had a childhood the 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.780
 truth very happy soon a 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:06.909
 economically also as it is said but 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.640
 but always my assets tried to 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.490
 arno best so I grew up 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.530
 well they created me as a healthy person 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.880
 my sisters also thank God and 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.780
 right now I was always the dream of 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.570
 football and already at 16 I went to Cali 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.940
 it was where it arrives, including first arrive 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.200
 the sporty cali but the 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.090
 opportunity to stay there was 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.580
 then that the American team of Cali 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.289
 gave him the opportunity in 2004 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.319
 debuting with his first goal as 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:37.929
 professional a good venezuela returned to 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:39.700
 Colombia to consolidate just to 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:42.670
 team that previously closed them 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.350
 doors return to colombia the sporty 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.150
 I thought it was the team that rejected me 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.090
 starting and they hired me 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.310
 as a professional and there he had a step 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.890
 short because 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.130
 It was good for me to play the same as a load for 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.110
 the band after hiring pool in 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.840
 chin exploited the great potential of duvier 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.220
 Riascos kept and soon became 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.850
 in the league 's top scorer 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:11.300
 Asian where his step was difficult the 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.190
 I left China more for the economic 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.560
 to change the life of my family the 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.080
 my life and that helped me a lot, I think 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.030
 that was more by sacrifice and by being by 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.970
 try to start to have good to me 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.400
 family and give their best to them 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.830
 the 'eagles' America 's bring it on 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.320
 summer of 2011 where it rained 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.780
 criticisms for considering it not suitable for 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.330
 the level of competition in Mexico and it's 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.040
 yielded to the people out there many means 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.920
 I saw that they talked and mocked that because 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.410
 I was coming or testing and that now 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.210
 I just see the interview and I laugh because 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.250
 I knew the ability of the 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.010
 first goal was just against the 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.200
 pachuca the truth that he remembered in 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.910
 some moments that I arrived here 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.970
 agreed that moment and if a great 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.620
 match against pachuca and me 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.540
 I was happy at that moment because 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.850
 I was facing a big man from Mexico 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.330
 duvier riascos was champion of the league mx 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.220
 opening 2012 when xolos de tijuana 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.500
 equal pachuca as hiring pump in 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.230
 the draft and already played his first minutes 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.240
 with the mining group I'm feeling 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.840
 best 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:19.540
 time participated in court so 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.970
 for me that's the important thing right now I know 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.730
 who will be working to continue giving what 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.100
 better of itself to get to the hundred 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.840
