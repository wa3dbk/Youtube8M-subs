 assisted in the future was because 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.850
 probably did not have time 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.100
 but the box of itself is like that and it is 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.689
 three years special of the village then 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.539

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.470

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.780

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.540

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.070
 brown pulled pro golden only he 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.440
 it really looks like a block that when 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.170
 you pass it with almost no change and 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.300

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.180
 I also love to be here, it was a mask 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.340
 royal blue then it will probably be 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.009
 very difficult to use also come and 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.500
 free protector that she brand is juarez 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.939

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.520
 that he is with a website but he is well 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.009
 big then so if little size is 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.890
 a very good size and it is an item of 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.990
 daily use of intense with argan oil 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.439

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.630
 this brand so not sure we arrived and already 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.430
 show came this smell here that is 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.380
 a post-treatment mask 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.240
 progressive but also serves to 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.790
 who has oily hair at the root and 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.770
 resected on the tip that is very my case 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.960
 It was so small, the hair is very 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.600
 big then I do not know if it will give the hair 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.030
 all but surely will increase and 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.640
 also these two samples here with this 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.270

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.810
 February megabox I confess I 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.460
 had created a lot of expectation up 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.530
 of the mountain range of the global system of 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.420
