full<00:03:48.560> circle<00:03:48.860> from<00:03:49.630> glass<00:03:50.630> as<00:03:50.930> a<00:03:50.959> liquid<00:03:51.260> ass

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
full circle from glass as a liquid ass

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.640 
full circle from glass as a liquid ass
and<00:03:52.040> all<00:03:52.430> the<00:03:52.940> way<00:03:53.090> back<00:03:53.330> around<00:03:53.750> back<00:03:54.620> to

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
and all the way back around back to

and all the way back around back to
nature<00:03:55.100> with<00:03:55.459> the<00:03:55.489> handles<00:03:56.030> I<00:03:56.269> think<00:03:56.510> it<00:03:56.720> just

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
nature with the handles I think it just

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.040 
nature with the handles I think it just
shows<00:03:57.140> you<00:03:57.650> how<00:03:57.890> quickly<00:03:58.310> in<00:03:58.970> this<00:03:59.269> material

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 
shows you how quickly in this material

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.550 
shows you how quickly in this material
you<00:04:00.440> can<00:04:00.650> go<00:04:00.769> from<00:04:01.010> concept<00:04:01.670> to<00:04:02.319> object<00:04:03.319> so<00:04:03.470> she

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
you can go from concept to object so she

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.030 
you can go from concept to object so she

that one and I'm quite fascinated by

create something out of nothing you take

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.830 
create something out of nothing you take
just<00:04:21.200> powders<00:04:22.010> and<00:04:22.150> molten<00:04:23.150> glass<00:04:23.360> from<00:04:23.660> the

little drips that come from the process
right<00:04:35.510> and<00:04:36.190> informed<00:04:37.190> the<00:04:37.400> whole<00:04:37.580> project<00:04:37.940> for

Bob shared how we are surrounded by
forests<00:04:56.330> and<00:04:56.979> the<00:04:57.979> little<00:04:58.280> things<00:04:58.970> that<00:04:59.210> are

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
forests and the little things that are

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.420 
forests and the little things that are
beautiful<00:05:00.050> like<00:05:00.470> mushrooms<00:05:01.010> because<00:05:01.160> you

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
beautiful like mushrooms because you

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.060 
beautiful like mushrooms because you
don't<00:05:01.580> plant<00:05:01.850> them<00:05:02.090> they're<00:05:02.419> just<00:05:02.450> there<00:05:02.930> as<00:05:03.200> I

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
don't plant them they're just there as I

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.810 
don't plant them they're just there as I
develop<00:05:04.520> it<00:05:04.700> it<00:05:04.880> become<00:05:05.240> a<00:05:05.900> ritual<00:05:06.710> object<00:05:07.430> for

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
develop it it become a ritual object for

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:08.590 
develop it it become a ritual object for
good<00:05:08.060> too

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 
good too

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.720 
good too
like<00:05:08.870> this<00:05:09.200> kind<00:05:09.470> of<00:05:11.860> for<00:05:12.860> me<00:05:13.100> this<00:05:13.370> is<00:05:13.550> the

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:13.730 
like this kind of for me this is the

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.840 
like this kind of for me this is the
best<00:05:14.500> time<00:05:15.500> I've<00:05:15.740> ever<00:05:15.770> designed<00:05:16.550> something

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
best time I've ever designed something

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.150 
best time I've ever designed something
because<00:05:17.540> it's<00:05:17.570> not<00:05:17.870> only<00:05:18.110> rendering<00:05:18.890> or

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
because it's not only rendering or

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.210 
because it's not only rendering or
thinking<00:05:19.820> about<00:05:19.910> an<00:05:20.390> object<00:05:20.870> just<00:05:21.710> the<00:05:21.950> way<00:05:22.100> it

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
thinking about an object just the way it

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.900 
thinking about an object just the way it
looks<00:05:22.460> it's<00:05:23.300> about<00:05:23.780> working<00:05:24.170> with<00:05:24.440> people<00:05:24.910> but

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
looks it's about working with people but

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.000 
looks it's about working with people but
for<00:05:25.970> me<00:05:26.300> it's<00:05:26.540> your<00:05:27.080> vast<00:05:27.350> experience<00:05:27.530> in

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.010 
for me it's your vast experience in

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:49.780 
for me it's your vast experience in
design

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:49.790 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.660 

this<00:05:50.790> is<00:05:50.940> the<00:05:51.090> first<00:05:51.360> for<00:05:51.570> me<00:05:51.720> seeing<00:05:52.560> the<00:05:52.920> hot

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:53.670 
this is the first for me seeing the hot

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.030 
this is the first for me seeing the hot
glass<00:05:53.970> and<00:05:54.330> listening<00:05:54.780> to<00:05:54.810> the<00:05:55.170> rain<00:05:55.650> on<00:05:55.920> the

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.040 
glass and listening to the rain on the

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.380 
glass and listening to the rain on the
hot<00:05:56.190> glass<00:05:56.460> I've<00:05:56.700> never<00:05:56.880> heard<00:05:57.060> that<00:05:57.120> before

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
hot glass I've never heard that before

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:02.120 
hot glass I've never heard that before
even<00:05:57.750> though<00:05:57.870> I'm<00:05:57.990> from<00:05:58.170> Seattle<00:05:58.850> it's<00:05:59.850> cool
