a ladder stitch or what's often referred
to<00:00:19.740> as<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.130> Henson<00:00:20.520> stitch<00:00:20.789> but<00:00:21.570> I<00:00:21.600> haven't

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
to as the Henson stitch but I haven't

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.420 
to as the Henson stitch but I haven't
had<00:00:22.109> much<00:00:22.260> luck<00:00:22.320> with<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:22.920> because<00:00:23.100> I'm<00:00:23.400> not

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
had much luck with it because I'm not

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.720

that<00:00:23.850> good<00:00:24.150> but<00:00:25.109> this<00:00:26.010> works<00:00:26.250> just<00:00:26.550> as<00:00:26.699> well

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
that good but this works just as well

and for at least certain types of

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.730 
and for at least certain types of
projects<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.119> so<00:00:30.869> let's<00:00:31.080> get<00:00:31.199> started

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
projects and so let's get started

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.209 
projects and so let's get started
okay<00:00:32.610> let's<00:00:32.820> there<00:00:33.480> we<00:00:33.600> go<00:00:34.550> alright<00:00:35.550> now<00:00:37.219> what

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
okay let's there we go alright now what

okay let's there we go alright now what
I've<00:00:38.340> got<00:00:38.370> here<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.059> I've<00:00:39.390> got<00:00:39.420> some<00:00:39.750> fleece

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
I've got here is I've got some fleece

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:43.910 
I've got here is I've got some fleece
and<00:00:41.219> this<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:42.000> anti-pill<00:00:42.510> fleece<00:00:42.920> the

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
and this is anti-pill fleece the

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.470 
and this is anti-pill fleece the
lighting<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.399> kind<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.700> throwing<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:45.120> off<00:00:45.270> they

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
lighting is kind of throwing it off they

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.080 
lighting is kind of throwing it off they
only<00:00:45.600> adjust<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.649> slightly<00:00:47.129> there<00:00:47.579> we<00:00:47.670> go

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
only adjust that slightly there we go

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.470 
only adjust that slightly there we go
but<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.649> can<00:00:49.800> see<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.160> we've<00:00:50.280> got<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.879> fuzzy

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
but you can see that we've got a fuzzy

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.830 
but you can see that we've got a fuzzy
side<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.219> a<00:00:53.219> smooth<00:00:53.430> side<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:54.570> what<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:54.750> do

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
side and a smooth side and so what I do

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.380 
side and a smooth side and so what I do
is<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.530> wind<00:00:55.800> my<00:00:55.980> seam<00:00:56.309> up<00:00:57.590> fuzzy<00:00:58.590> side<00:00:58.829> in<00:00:59.390> so

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
is I wind my seam up fuzzy side in so

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.369 
is I wind my seam up fuzzy side in so
whatever<00:01:00.719> side<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.050> want<00:01:01.199> on<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.350> outside

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
whatever side you want on the outside

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.759 
whatever side you want on the outside
we'll<00:01:02.010> start<00:01:02.340> with<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.699> inside<00:01:03.320> all<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.559> can

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
we'll start with it inside all you can

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.580 
we'll start with it inside all you can
do<00:01:04.920> this<00:01:05.070> one<00:01:05.220> same<00:01:05.430> set<00:01:05.960> you<00:01:06.960> can<00:01:07.140> do<00:01:07.290> this<00:01:07.439> one

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
do this one same set you can do this one

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.620 
do this one same set you can do this one
without<00:01:07.650> doing<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.130> reversed<00:01:08.490> it's<00:01:09.450> just

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
without doing it reversed it's just

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.850 
without doing it reversed it's just
easier<00:01:10.229> if<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.500> do<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:10.860> way<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:12.650> then<00:01:13.650> we

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
easier if you do it this way and then we

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.719 
easier if you do it this way and then we
take<00:01:14.180> for<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.240> purposes<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.750> this<00:01:16.049> process

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
take for the purposes of this process

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.420 
take for the purposes of this process
I'm<00:01:17.729> using<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.240> black<00:01:18.600> thread<00:01:19.049> so<00:01:19.979> it'll<00:01:20.189> stand

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
I'm using a black thread so it'll stand

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.149 
I'm using a black thread so it'll stand
out<00:01:20.640> more<00:01:21.259> against<00:01:22.259> what<00:01:22.439> we've<00:01:22.560> got<00:01:22.770> here<00:01:23.009> and

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
out more against what we've got here and

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.980 
out more against what we've got here and
let<00:01:23.369> me<00:01:23.460> see<00:01:23.580> if<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.700> can<00:01:23.850> get<00:01:23.970> this<00:01:24.119> camera<00:01:24.930> a

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
let me see if I can get this camera a

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.460 
let me see if I can get this camera a
little<00:01:25.080> bit<00:01:25.200> closer<00:01:25.560> here<00:01:29.930> there<00:01:30.930> enjoy<00:01:31.200> my

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
little bit closer here there enjoy my

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:40.210 
little bit closer here there enjoy my
keyboard

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.070 

there<00:01:40.790> we<00:01:40.910> go<00:01:41.150> a<00:01:42.790> little<00:01:43.790> blurry<00:01:44.150> but<00:01:44.330> gets<00:01:44.960> the

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
there we go a little blurry but gets the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:56.530 
there we go a little blurry but gets the
point<00:01:45.290> across<00:01:46.720> okay<00:01:47.720> and<00:01:48.020> so

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:06.410 

thread<00:01:57.230> your<00:01:57.260> needle

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.820 

like<00:02:07.020> so

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
like so

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.540 
like so
and<00:02:09.130> then<00:02:10.740> wherever<00:02:11.740> you're<00:02:12.010> starting<00:02:12.430> your

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
and then wherever you're starting your

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.530 
and then wherever you're starting your
stitch<00:02:14.310> loop<00:02:15.310> through<00:02:15.640> both<00:02:15.670> of<00:02:16.030> them<00:02:16.360> at<00:02:16.510> the

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
stitch loop through both of them at the

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.660 
stitch loop through both of them at the
edge<00:02:19.590> now<00:02:20.590> normally<00:02:20.980> you<00:02:21.100> would<00:02:21.220> be<00:02:21.310> using<00:02:21.610> a

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
edge now normally you would be using a

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.430 
edge now normally you would be using a
matching<00:02:22.180> color<00:02:22.390> thread<00:02:22.780> but<00:02:23.050> this<00:02:23.200> is<00:02:23.320> just

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
matching color thread but this is just

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.020 
matching color thread but this is just
so<00:02:23.590> it<00:02:23.710> will<00:02:23.830> stand<00:02:24.070> out<00:02:24.250> better<00:02:24.400> on<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:24.790> video

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
so it will stand out better on the video

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.960 
so it will stand out better on the video
and<00:02:26.190> I<00:02:27.190> just<00:02:28.290> loop<00:02:29.290> it<00:02:29.470> once<00:02:29.710> then<00:02:30.340> slide<00:02:30.760> it

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
and I just loop it once then slide it

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:40.020 
and I just loop it once then slide it
through<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:35.370> knot<00:02:36.370> it<00:02:36.400> to<00:02:37.120> tie<00:02:37.330> it<00:02:37.450> off<00:02:39.030> there

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
through and knot it to tie it off there

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:49.260 
through and knot it to tie it off there
what<00:02:40.420> you<00:02:40.540> do<00:02:41.250> is<00:02:44.790> you<00:02:45.790> slide<00:02:46.090> from<00:02:48.270> inside

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
what you do is you slide from inside

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.050 
what you do is you slide from inside
surface<00:02:50.230> to<00:02:50.380> out<00:02:50.580> catching<00:02:51.580> only<00:02:51.670> one<00:02:52.060> side<00:02:52.710> of

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
surface to out catching only one side of

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:01.610 
surface to out catching only one side of
the<00:02:55.060> actual<00:02:55.540> fabric<00:02:56.020> with<00:02:56.170> each<00:02:56.290> pass<00:02:57.600> so<00:03:00.480> go

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
the actual fabric with each pass so go

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.390 
the actual fabric with each pass so go
back<00:03:02.620> and<00:03:03.190> forth<00:03:04.500> back<00:03:05.500> and<00:03:05.530> forth<00:03:05.950> you<00:03:06.280> want

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
back and forth back and forth you want

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.850 
back and forth back and forth you want
to<00:03:06.460> keep<00:03:06.610> these<00:03:06.760> relatively<00:03:07.360> tight<00:03:07.740> but<00:03:08.740> you

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
to keep these relatively tight but you

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.860 
to keep these relatively tight but you
never<00:03:09.070> want<00:03:09.340> to<00:03:09.430> cross<00:03:09.760> back<00:03:10.240> over<00:03:10.540> them

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
never want to cross back over them

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.360 
never want to cross back over them
because<00:03:10.990> that<00:03:11.200> will<00:03:11.350> cause<00:03:11.530> problems<00:03:11.800> later

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
because that will cause problems later

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.780 
because that will cause problems later
so<00:03:12.760> you<00:03:12.850> never<00:03:13.000> want<00:03:13.239> to<00:03:13.300> double<00:03:14.110> up<00:03:14.640> but<00:03:15.640> what

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
so you never want to double up but what

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.150 
so you never want to double up but what
you<00:03:15.910> see<00:03:16.150> is<00:03:16.180> see<00:03:16.720> coming<00:03:16.959> together<00:03:17.110> here<00:03:17.680> is

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
you see is see coming together here is

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.740 
you see is see coming together here is
like<00:03:18.880> the<00:03:19.030> stitches<00:03:19.390> on<00:03:19.510> a<00:03:19.540> baseball<00:03:21.390> now<00:03:22.390> the

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
like the stitches on a baseball now the

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.350 
like the stitches on a baseball now the
advantage<00:03:23.290> of<00:03:23.470> this<00:03:23.880> will<00:03:24.880> be<00:03:25.030> readily

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
advantage of this will be readily

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.070 
advantage of this will be readily
apparent<00:03:25.540> in<00:03:26.050> a<00:03:26.140> moment<00:03:26.680> now<00:03:27.630> I'm<00:03:28.630> just<00:03:28.930> going

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
apparent in a moment now I'm just going

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:35.820 
apparent in a moment now I'm just going
to<00:03:29.110> do<00:03:29.260> a<00:03:29.290> short<00:03:29.709> length<00:03:32.970> do<00:03:34.350> about<00:03:35.350> an<00:03:35.530> inch

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
to do a short length do about an inch

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:43.170 
to do a short length do about an inch
inch<00:03:36.250> and<00:03:36.400> a<00:03:36.489> half<00:03:36.520> in<00:03:37.680> this<00:03:38.680> fashion<00:03:42.120> it's<00:03:43.120> a

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
inch and a half in this fashion it's a

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.869 
inch and a half in this fashion it's a
nice<00:03:43.360> repeating<00:03:43.900> pattern<00:03:44.320> here

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.699 

okay<00:03:49.450> lost<00:03:49.749> the<00:03:50.019> thread<00:03:50.620> but<00:03:50.879> that'll<00:03:51.879> do<00:03:52.090> and

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
okay lost the thread but that'll do and

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.059 
okay lost the thread but that'll do and
so<00:03:53.709> here<00:03:54.099> we've<00:03:54.249> got<00:03:55.920> doesn't<00:03:56.920> do<00:03:56.980> the

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
so here we've got doesn't do the

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:58.559 
so here we've got doesn't do the
close-ups<00:03:57.489> that<00:03:57.670> well<00:03:57.819> but<00:03:57.999> you<00:03:58.060> can<00:03:58.209> see<00:03:58.239> that

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
close-ups that well but you can see that

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.800 
close-ups that well but you can see that
that<00:03:59.260> process<00:03:59.859> there<00:04:00.159> and<00:04:01.030> see<00:04:01.209> how<00:04:01.299> the<00:04:01.359> the

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
that process there and see how the the

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.770 
that process there and see how the the
thread<00:04:02.109> loops<00:04:02.639> then<00:04:03.639> you<00:04:04.420> lay<00:04:04.599> it<00:04:04.719> down<00:04:04.749> flat

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
thread loops then you lay it down flat

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.890 
thread loops then you lay it down flat
take<00:04:07.780> the<00:04:08.290> loose<00:04:08.530> side<00:04:08.829> of<00:04:09.099> the<00:04:09.219> thread<00:04:09.519> and

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
take the loose side of the thread and

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.080 
take the loose side of the thread and
just<00:04:10.950> we<00:04:11.950> can't<00:04:12.219> get<00:04:12.370> a<00:04:12.400> little<00:04:12.519> bit<00:04:12.730> better<00:04:12.879> of

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
just we can't get a little bit better of

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:20.199 
just we can't get a little bit better of
an<00:04:13.180> angle<00:04:13.480> on<00:04:13.599> that

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.960 

and<00:04:20.419> then<00:04:20.959> while<00:04:21.799> pressing<00:04:21.829> and<00:04:22.430> holding<00:04:22.460> down

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.320 

you<00:04:25.970> pull<00:04:26.360> it<00:04:26.509> tight<00:04:27.699> now<00:04:28.699> this<00:04:28.850> will<00:04:29.000> cinch

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
you pull it tight now this will cinch

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.620 
you pull it tight now this will cinch
the<00:04:29.539> two<00:04:29.690> sides<00:04:29.990> together<00:04:30.289> and<00:04:31.360> when<00:04:32.360> you<00:04:32.449> look

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
the two sides together and when you look

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.490 
the two sides together and when you look
at<00:04:32.750> the<00:04:32.840> other<00:04:32.960> side<00:04:35.110> seam<00:04:36.110> is<00:04:36.289> almost

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
at the other side seam is almost

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.240 
at the other side seam is almost
completely<00:04:36.919> invisible<00:04:38.889> you<00:04:39.889> can<00:04:40.009> go<00:04:40.130> in<00:04:40.220> with

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
completely invisible you can go in with

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.930 
completely invisible you can go in with
the<00:04:40.430> needle<00:04:40.729> pick<00:04:41.180> that<00:04:41.419> out<00:04:42.220> and<00:04:43.220> it<00:04:43.729> will

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
the needle pick that out and it will

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.420 
the needle pick that out and it will
just<00:04:44.449> barely<00:04:44.930> show<00:04:45.289> up<00:04:45.440> on<00:04:45.620> camera<00:04:45.949> depending

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
just barely show up on camera depending

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.110 
just barely show up on camera depending
on<00:04:46.520> how<00:04:46.639> your<00:04:46.789> lighting<00:04:47.090> setup<00:04:47.419> goes<00:04:48.850> then<00:04:49.850> all

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
on how your lighting setup goes then all

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.810 
on how your lighting setup goes then all
you<00:04:50.300> have<00:04:50.479> to<00:04:50.690> do<00:04:50.840> is<00:04:51.740> every<00:04:52.160> couple<00:04:52.610> of<00:04:52.699> inches

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
you have to do is every couple of inches

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:58.240 
you have to do is every couple of inches
of<00:04:53.180> this<00:04:55.419> when<00:04:56.419> you<00:04:56.539> do<00:04:56.660> a<00:04:56.690> when<00:04:57.650> you<00:04:57.740> pull<00:04:58.130> it

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
of this when you do a when you pull it

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:07.600 
of this when you do a when you pull it
tight<00:04:58.660> this<00:04:59.660> moment

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.960 

once<00:05:08.240> again<00:05:08.360> on<00:05:08.630> the<00:05:08.750> backside<00:05:09.260> you<00:05:09.850> just<00:05:10.850> do<00:05:10.940> a

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
once again on the backside you just do a

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.490 
once again on the backside you just do a
single<00:05:11.240> whip<00:05:11.540> stitch<00:05:11.870> that<00:05:12.080> goes<00:05:12.140> through

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
single whip stitch that goes through

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:22.210 
single whip stitch that goes through
both<00:05:12.530> sides<00:05:17.470> and<00:05:19.150> then<00:05:20.150> another<00:05:20.450> one<00:05:20.810> that<00:05:21.220> you

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
both sides and then another one that you

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.930 
both sides and then another one that you
not<00:05:22.490> through<00:05:22.970> and<00:05:23.750> that'll<00:05:24.410> keep<00:05:24.530> it<00:05:24.710> from

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
not through and that'll keep it from

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.940 
not through and that'll keep it from
coming<00:05:25.940> loose<00:05:26.090> on<00:05:26.480> you<00:05:26.770> and<00:05:27.770> you<00:05:27.830> just

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:27.950 
coming loose on you and you just

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.920 
coming loose on you and you just
continue<00:05:28.130> that<00:05:28.400> down<00:05:28.820> along<00:05:29.150> the<00:05:29.420> length<00:05:29.750> of

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
continue that down along the length of

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:36.520 
continue that down along the length of
your<00:05:30.020> seam<00:05:30.580> and<00:05:34.810> now<00:05:35.810> this<00:05:35.930> works<00:05:36.170> best<00:05:36.380> with

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
your seam and now this works best with

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.590 
your seam and now this works best with
an<00:05:36.680> anti<00:05:36.980> pill<00:05:37.220> fleece<00:05:38.470> where<00:05:39.470> you<00:05:39.650> can<00:05:40.600> wear

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 
an anti pill fleece where you can wear

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.330 
an anti pill fleece where you can wear
the<00:05:41.780> the<00:05:42.200> fuzz<00:05:42.410> will<00:05:42.440> help<00:05:42.770> cover<00:05:43.010> up<00:05:43.100> the

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
the the fuzz will help cover up the

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.070 
the the fuzz will help cover up the
stitch<00:05:43.610> but<00:05:44.420> you<00:05:44.540> can<00:05:44.690> even<00:05:44.840> make<00:05:45.050> it

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
stitch but you can even make it

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.690 
stitch but you can even make it
difficult<00:05:45.410> to<00:05:45.800> see<00:05:46.040> on<00:05:46.750> the<00:05:47.750> smooth<00:05:47.990> side<00:05:48.290> too

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:48.700 
difficult to see on the smooth side too

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.880 
difficult to see on the smooth side too
