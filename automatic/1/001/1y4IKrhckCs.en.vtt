as you can see here i'm not concerned
with<00:01:20.910> finding<00:01:21.910> the<00:01:22.660> exact<00:01:23.140> or<00:01:23.440> correct<00:01:23.830> line

with finding the exact or correct line

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.650 
with finding the exact or correct line
throughout<00:01:25.180> the<00:01:25.390> entire<00:01:25.720> process<00:01:27.660> it's

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
throughout the entire process it's

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
throughout the entire process it's
important<00:01:29.290> that<00:01:29.740> that<00:01:30.870> i<00:01:32.190> don't<00:01:33.190> try<00:01:33.580> to<00:01:34.680> make

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
important that that i don't try to make

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.130 
important that that i don't try to make
it<00:01:35.710> ruler<00:01:36.280> perfect<00:01:36.820> that<00:01:37.480> isn't<00:01:37.870> what<00:01:37.990> the

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
it ruler perfect that isn't what the

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.700 
it ruler perfect that isn't what the
pain<00:01:38.350> only<00:01:38.590> approach<00:01:38.920> is<00:01:39.130> about<00:01:39.370> it<00:01:39.550> all<00:01:39.730> a

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.680 

painterly<00:01:44.710> approach<00:01:45.310> would<00:01:46.120> be<00:01:46.300> like<00:01:46.510> an

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
painterly approach would be like an

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.420 
painterly approach would be like an
archer<00:01:47.430> someone<00:01:48.430> who<00:01:48.730> guesstimates<00:01:49.570> and<00:01:50.430> and

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
archer someone who guesstimates and and

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.530 
archer someone who guesstimates and and
tries<00:01:52.090> to<00:01:52.330> make<00:01:52.510> the<00:01:52.840> most<00:01:53.020> accurate

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
tries to make the most accurate

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.000 
tries to make the most accurate
decisions<00:01:55.540> off<00:01:55.930> the<00:01:56.650> cuff<00:01:56.890> and<00:01:58.080> or<00:01:59.080> like<00:01:59.890> the

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
decisions off the cuff and or like the

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.230 
decisions off the cuff and or like the
driver<00:02:00.310> of<00:02:00.490> a<00:02:00.670> car<00:02:01.740> you're<00:02:02.740> not<00:02:03.210> you're<00:02:04.210> not

driver of a car you're not you're not

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.999 
driver of a car you're not you're not
being<00:02:04.990> a<00:02:06.510> perfectionist<00:02:07.510> about<00:02:08.050> it<00:02:08.410> because

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
being a perfectionist about it because

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.529 
being a perfectionist about it because
you're<00:02:09.399> in<00:02:09.519> the<00:02:09.640> middle<00:02:09.819> of<00:02:10.000> it<00:02:10.209> you<00:02:10.390> don't

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
you're in the middle of it you don't

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.559 
you're in the middle of it you don't
have<00:02:10.599> time<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:12.099> stop<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:12.579> car

have time to stop the car

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.899 
have time to stop the car
and<00:02:13.709> measure<00:02:14.709> to<00:02:15.159> make<00:02:15.310> sure<00:02:15.370> that<00:02:15.879> you're

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:15.909 
and measure to make sure that you're

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:18.030 
and measure to make sure that you're
exactly<00:02:16.420> on<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.870> right<00:02:17.170> place<00:02:17.469> of<00:02:17.709> the<00:02:17.799> road

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
and that's the real that is the real

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.750 
and that's the real that is the real
beauty<00:02:24.459> of<00:02:24.639> the<00:02:25.030> painterly<00:02:25.389> process<00:02:26.760> because

the<00:03:13.599> message<00:03:14.079> and<00:03:14.760> any<00:03:15.760> time<00:03:16.120> you<00:03:16.150> do<00:03:16.510> that<00:03:16.540> it

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
the message and any time you do that it

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.379 
the message and any time you do that it
makes<00:03:17.530> for<00:03:17.799> a<00:03:17.859> stronger<00:03:18.870> lettering<00:03:19.870> design

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
makes for a stronger lettering design

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:25.890 
makes for a stronger lettering design
now<00:03:22.389> with<00:03:22.629> these<00:03:22.810> letters<00:03:24.180> now<00:03:25.180> right<00:03:25.659> here

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
now with these letters now right here

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.379 
now with these letters now right here
you<00:03:26.049> can<00:03:26.229> see<00:03:26.439> i'm<00:03:26.709> just<00:03:27.069> in<00:03:27.430> in<00:03:27.790> the<00:03:27.909> program

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.389 
you can see i'm just in in the program

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:31.229 
you can see i'm just in in the program
I'm<00:03:28.689> graying<00:03:29.620> out<00:03:29.949> the<00:03:30.370> area<00:03:30.579> so<00:03:30.970> that<00:03:31.000> I<00:03:31.180> can

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
I'm graying out the area so that I can

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.599 
I'm graying out the area so that I can
go<00:03:31.479> back<00:03:31.750> and<00:03:31.810> highlight<00:03:32.409> the<00:03:32.590> letters<00:03:32.919> and

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:40.469 

for<00:03:36.609> the<00:03:36.879> font<00:03:37.379> basically<00:03:38.379> I'm<00:03:39.220> playing<00:03:40.180> off

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:40.479 
for the font basically I'm playing off

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:45.990 
for the font basically I'm playing off
the<00:03:40.509> idea<00:03:41.019> of<00:03:41.319> notes<00:03:41.739> on<00:03:42.009> a<00:03:42.040> scale<00:03:42.549> and<00:03:45.000> though

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
the idea of notes on a scale and though

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.330 
the idea of notes on a scale and though
I<00:03:47.250> don't<00:03:48.250> do<00:03:48.459> music<00:03:48.939> tutorials<00:03:49.720> as<00:03:50.109> a<00:03:50.699> media

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
I don't do music tutorials as a media

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.409 
I don't do music tutorials as a media
because<00:03:54.340> they<00:03:54.609> are<00:03:54.729> tutorials<00:03:55.090> on<00:03:55.449> media<00:03:55.930> I

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
because they are tutorials on media I

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:01.259 
because they are tutorials on media I
think<00:03:58.419> that<00:03:58.599> it<00:03:58.719> still<00:03:59.699> would<00:04:00.699> be<00:04:00.819> good<00:04:01.000> to<00:04:01.150> go

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
think that it still would be good to go

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:02.999 
think that it still would be good to go
ahead<00:04:01.419> and<00:04:01.659> play<00:04:01.870> off<00:04:02.049> the<00:04:02.229> idea<00:04:02.530> you<00:04:02.650> can<00:04:02.769> see

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:03.009 
ahead and play off the idea you can see

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:04.920 
ahead and play off the idea you can see
how<00:04:03.189> the<00:04:03.250> oh<00:04:03.340> here<00:04:03.879> is<00:04:04.030> very<00:04:04.329> much<00:04:04.569> like<00:04:04.780> the

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
how the oh here is very much like the

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.879 
how the oh here is very much like the
shape<00:04:05.199> of<00:04:05.469> the<00:04:06.569> quarter<00:04:07.569> note<00:04:07.810> on<00:04:08.049> a<00:04:08.109> musical

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:08.889 
shape of the quarter note on a musical

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:11.339 
shape of the quarter note on a musical
scale<00:04:09.250> and<00:04:09.549> I<00:04:09.969> can't<00:04:10.239> really<00:04:10.359> make<00:04:10.599> the<00:04:10.659> s<00:04:10.930> fit

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:11.349 
scale and I can't really make the s fit

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:13.199 
scale and I can't really make the s fit
that<00:04:11.590> shape<00:04:11.949> but<00:04:12.129> I<00:04:12.219> can<00:04:12.430> still<00:04:12.639> kind<00:04:12.849> of<00:04:12.969> play

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
that shape but I can still kind of play

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.180 
that shape but I can still kind of play
off<00:04:13.449> that<00:04:14.280> italicized<00:04:15.280> you<00:04:15.759> see<00:04:15.969> how<00:04:16.120> the<00:04:16.180> o<00:04:16.269> is

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
off that italicized you see how the o is

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.010 
off that italicized you see how the o is
oval<00:04:18.190> but<00:04:18.519> the<00:04:18.849> direction<00:04:19.509> of<00:04:19.810> the<00:04:19.930> oval<00:04:20.349> is

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
oval but the direction of the oval is

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.290 
oval but the direction of the oval is
italicized<00:04:23.020> and

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
italicized and

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.649 
italicized and
I<00:04:24.360> continue<00:04:25.259> that<00:04:25.610> general<00:04:26.610> movement<00:04:26.909> in<00:04:27.479> all

00:04:27.649 --> 00:04:27.659 
I continue that general movement in all

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:31.070 
I continue that general movement in all
the<00:04:27.840> other<00:04:27.870> letters<00:04:28.470> in<00:04:29.090> the<00:04:30.090> EU<00:04:30.569> can<00:04:30.750> see<00:04:30.960> the

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
the other letters in the EU can see the

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.320 
the other letters in the EU can see the
e<00:04:31.110> is<00:04:31.530> very<00:04:31.979> much<00:04:32.220> following<00:04:32.759> the<00:04:32.879> shape<00:04:33.090> of

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
e is very much following the shape of

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.689 
e is very much following the shape of
the<00:04:33.650> quarter<00:04:34.650> note<00:04:34.830> that<00:04:35.039> you<00:04:35.129> would<00:04:35.250> find<00:04:35.520> in

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:35.699 
the quarter note that you would find in

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:42.980 
the quarter note that you would find in
a<00:04:35.819> scale<00:04:36.120> and<00:04:38.840> also<00:04:41.569> the<00:04:42.569> thing<00:04:42.780> about

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
a scale and also the thing about

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.570 
a scale and also the thing about
painting<00:04:43.470> is<00:04:43.620> that<00:04:43.919> you're<00:04:46.039> continually<00:04:47.039> like

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
painting is that you're continually like

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.610 
painting is that you're continually like
walking<00:04:48.240> over<00:04:48.509> things<00:04:48.780> you've<00:04:49.050> already<00:04:49.409> done

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
walking over things you've already done

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.879 
walking over things you've already done
you're<00:04:51.139> not<00:04:52.139> trying<00:04:52.830> to<00:04:53.460> avoid<00:04:54.530> messing<00:04:55.530> up

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
you're not trying to avoid messing up

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:58.070 
you're not trying to avoid messing up
it's<00:04:56.159> a<00:04:56.310> messy<00:04:56.699> process<00:04:56.879> all<00:04:57.509> the<00:04:57.629> way<00:04:57.659> through

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
it's a messy process all the way through

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.749 
it's a messy process all the way through
so<00:04:58.110> you<00:04:58.379> you<00:04:58.889> may<00:04:59.069> have<00:04:59.280> gotten<00:04:59.460> the<00:04:59.729> e

00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 
so you you may have gotten the e

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:02.320 
so you you may have gotten the e
correctly<00:05:00.419> the<00:05:00.539> first<00:05:00.569> time<00:05:01.050> but<00:05:01.289> in<00:05:01.500> making

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
correctly the first time but in making

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.600 
correctly the first time but in making
the<00:05:03.330> darkness<00:05:03.870> around<00:05:04.050> the<00:05:04.409> e<00:05:04.440> darker<00:05:05.129> you're

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
the darkness around the e darker you're

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.659 
the darkness around the e darker you're
going<00:05:05.789> to<00:05:05.849> end<00:05:06.030> up<00:05:06.800> overlapping<00:05:07.800> in<00:05:08.219> the<00:05:08.310> L<00:05:08.460> you

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
going to end up overlapping in the L you

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:10.850 
going to end up overlapping in the L you
can<00:05:08.819> see<00:05:09.000> how<00:05:09.180> I<00:05:09.210> just<00:05:09.360> run<00:05:09.659> in<00:05:09.990> and<00:05:10.020> I<00:05:10.289> go<00:05:10.740> ahead

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
can see how I just run in and I go ahead

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.939 
can see how I just run in and I go ahead
and<00:05:11.360> cover<00:05:12.360> up<00:05:12.569> what<00:05:12.780> I've<00:05:12.900> done<00:05:13.050> before<00:05:13.530> but

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:13.949 
and cover up what I've done before but

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:16.580 
and cover up what I've done before but
it's<00:05:14.099> much<00:05:14.340> easier<00:05:14.370> to<00:05:14.819> go<00:05:15.060> back<00:05:15.330> and<00:05:15.659> and<00:05:15.960> fix

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
it's much easier to go back and and fix

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:23.839 
it's much easier to go back and and fix
that<00:05:16.860> and<00:05:18.110> the<00:05:19.110> painterly<00:05:19.440> process<00:05:20.960> is<00:05:22.370> a<00:05:23.370> lot

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:23.849 
that and the painterly process is a lot

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:26.629 
that and the painterly process is a lot
funner<00:05:24.240> if<00:05:24.659> you<00:05:24.930> ask<00:05:25.199> me<00:05:25.530> because<00:05:25.860> you<00:05:26.099> you<00:05:26.460> can

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 
funner if you ask me because you you can

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:29.450 
funner if you ask me because you you can
just<00:05:26.849> go<00:05:27.569> in<00:05:27.750> there<00:05:27.960> and<00:05:28.020> you're<00:05:28.770> not<00:05:29.009> like

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
just go in there and you're not like

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.490 
just go in there and you're not like
constantly<00:05:30.090> stop<00:05:30.449> starting<00:05:30.990> you're<00:05:31.259> just

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
constantly stop starting you're just

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.830 
constantly stop starting you're just
you're<00:05:31.949> flowing<00:05:32.310> with<00:05:32.639> it<00:05:32.880> and<00:05:33.150> and<00:05:35.509> now<00:05:36.509> what

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
you're flowing with it and and now what

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.689 
you're flowing with it and and now what
you<00:05:36.930> can<00:05:36.960> see<00:05:37.259> here<00:05:37.289> is<00:05:37.680> I'm<00:05:37.889> using<00:05:38.460> the

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:38.699 
you can see here is I'm using the

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:43.909 
you can see here is I'm using the
program<00:05:39.620> to<00:05:40.620> just<00:05:41.599> work<00:05:42.599> out<00:05:42.840> the<00:05:43.590> overall

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 
program to just work out the overall

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:46.420 
program to just work out the overall
Gray's<00:05:44.370> because<00:05:45.000> then<00:05:45.180> I<00:05:45.270> can<00:05:45.330> go<00:05:45.599> back<00:05:45.840> and

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
Gray's because then I can go back and
