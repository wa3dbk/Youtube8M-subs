00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.690
 this is permanently live 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.759
 learning and teaching all this is not 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:14.240
 the mp4 policy the rapporteur of the group i nothing more then we continue but before the 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.240
 public opinion and before the whole world one has certain way the 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:22.130
 it may be that in the specific case of tithe w 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.050
 to exist or perhaps one an extra load because it is not a week 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.720
 special for pure cyclic racing archers and even you may have 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.330
 a possibility as the case there was some of this 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.570
 it was agreed to work open doors and two things that 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.080
 today we work with journalism benefited 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.940
 not done based on fact everywhere not 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.270
 again you can run these types of risks and we talk about it permanently 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.100
 what 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.440
 existing obligations 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.470
 would not be responsible up above all the things we can not 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.970
 Close the doors 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:55.930
 because if 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.800
 sometimes we run that risk 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.810
 is inside the rivers we can not run at some time wolf 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.070
 group head I understand but not only among us as it should not 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.030
 Roman will not solve them 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.010
 they have to solve them 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.810
 as it matches 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.970
 and after that there are guidelines for that 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.220
 for that there within the group there are people 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.600
 that keeps 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.520
 serenity and responsibility as a happy and happy past because they have not 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.520
 finished resolved them efe the way to learn about group nule 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.940
 there are such Guinean practiced 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.400
 with the new law 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.400
 the sensation of current affairs on the other side we n 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.280
 the closure when bargaining to give a certain timba sensation of not understanding 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.260
 nothing but also this 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.030
 I understand that separates us 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.100
 vicente kill 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.320
 important in a sarcastic tone 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.560
 and the balance decision in definitive Fernandez and Jimenez speaks 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.160
 Indonesia 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.159
 confirmed the decision as a coach and 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.290
 maybe there's not much else to explain 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.230
 I think I speak, I speak 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.350
 of olivera and and it ends and it does not 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.350
 nor did they find alive at the last moment 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.049
 but I look at it 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:14.439
 1 lot of situations and 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:15.379
 my wife 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.469
 It is not that either 

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:20.469
 I've ruled out for life or something like that they're 

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:23.980
 difficult situations to be deduced way he 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.750
 needing working 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:26.899
 and there it comes out 

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:28.340
 edmund wilson 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.349
 if you talk about the goalie it's the hardest decision because the goalkeeper 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.180
 finally came out because if to the limit yellow a fusion an injury the 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.520
 technical break the hardest when it has to do with them to what you 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.159
 you passed 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:45.189
 they are not all difficult decisions 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:48.499
 it's crazy it's a big club and taking 

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:50.030
 for the red ones the big one 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.530
 everything is magnified 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.739
 holy 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.709
 Victory or defeat in situations 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.769
 any decision of a large club 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.509
 Is completely 

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:02.499
 different and 

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:05.769
 permanently evaluating many more things 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.290
 martín is located in 2 matías fernández in basilea will be in this 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.909
 appointment 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:14.079
 coomaraswamy 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:16.379
 Now whoever wants 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:17.679
 brady 

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:20.679
 harrelson archer who have had my trust is a young archer 

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:24.589
 the real prem premier rice champion with hill 

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:28.289
 in the opportunity to do it 

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:29.900
 and that's what happened 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.900
 there may be disciplinary sanctions 

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:36.569
 he only drives very internally 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.709
 and when they fixed it between them 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.049
 because the beauty companies of which on July 3 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.320
 I always say the same 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.320
 happens outside is wrong or Ramadan as appropriate 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.769
 we have the obligation to win 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.579
 another type image that sure 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.549
 because it is not anorexia 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.819
 if here and want to think that everything is wrong that you think you have all the right 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.729
 because ultimately the public are open doors we run risk 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.509
 if only it will contribute is whole 

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:09.369
 polo or other types of assumptions are handled 

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:12.089
 if one wants to grow and wants 

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:13.799
 the coffin 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.840
 in the way that I consider to be permanently at risk 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:19.779
 yes clear many mobile 

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:21.680
 although the Lima commune 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.520
 jaime ortega 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.199
 the oea 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:30.059
 I made the determination and and I think that it does not correspond nor what I talked to him and 

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:32.309
 what we talk about is public 

00:04:32.309 --> 00:04:34.430
 after any dt 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.840
 everyone has the right to do another kind of opinion graphics don omar 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:38.840
 the determination 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.680
 all in the neck 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.080
 it's a big club all the decision polls like they cost any 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.180
 decision in 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.830
 in any case 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.499
 important klug of Argentina that has the transcendence of land 

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:51.119
 we play
