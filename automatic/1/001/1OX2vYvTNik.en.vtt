00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:50.150
 there is here you can study the text as 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:53.570

 the third part consists of two volumes 1 volume 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:07.130
 the so-called common trick am 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.709
 concept of getting street back and 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:16.420

 when to give them how to set how to turn 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:23.150

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.280
 video but not laying out a lot 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.490
 of the moment 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:50.750
 that they are good therefore 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:53.970

 There is a variety of different hands with 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:20.380
 different variations of the draw so i 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:23.180
 I will say just three parts there are two of 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:28.250
 a piece of the video where it explains 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:32.360
 various total course takes more than 2 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:36.740
 hours 2:40 mind so man 36 exactly 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:39.580
 to be exact well, and the fourth part 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:42.110
 this is a very important part even for she 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:45.080
 good players that everyone understands it 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.330

 poker that is the first thing that he 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:57.950

00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:00.980

 hold'em manager when playing poker 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:12.380
 few players understand because 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:18.950
 you need to look not only at the remnants 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:20.750
 preflop raise and there all sorts of sweets of but 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.690

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:26.380
 unknown to a wide range that is here 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:31.850

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:32.750
 But in general, that's all we see from 4 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.600
 parts 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:39.670
