00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:22.039
 beauty talks to us today let's study the set of numbers 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:23.050
 passionate 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.650
 but before that leaves a message for you 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.980
 subscribe to our channel on youtube 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.980
 because only then you will be aware of all with our news 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.770
 it was worth people then the set of mine with signs that will be presented by 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.570
 letter that 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.470
 We can say that the national numbers 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.690
 they will represent more as a mathematical consolation than that people 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.120
 works with concepts such as quotations that we share with some 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.550
 thing in equal parts 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.420
 these questions are only possible within the set of national 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.720
 For us, it defines the functional ones. 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.920
 an element of burials 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.239
 eder also with internal elements 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.670
 only that the internal Centaur 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.490
 then all elements national machida format 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.240
 what an integer about what? 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.710
 here is also the burial and if all the 0 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.460
 elements of the nationals but if the division is thirty-two integers being 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.740
 that the burial from below 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.740
 can not co number the heroes 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.720
 We have to 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.030
 search internal elements or less 4-2 and a half 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.670
 the 0 that I am 6 537 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.460
 and so are my people 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:38.780
 Note 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.310
 every funeral will be a professional 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.990
 why what can we present with whom I want through the division 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.920
 of two other integers for example you agree that we can 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.350
 display a number 2 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.350
 through the division of eight by four 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.130
 because of this 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.130
 every integer that will also be a national block 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.240
 will also be valid the following polls 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.290
 There are more positive signs 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.150
 River - 

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:09.589
 there are negative signs 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:10.900
 keita fiscal 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.829
 the Portuguese selection ie without the zero 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:17.280
 Keiko will risk with more positive light works 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.959
 and that this risk with less 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.959
 negative non-negative emotions 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.409
 the same properties of confrontations prior to 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:31.529
 people are now seeing the properties of nationals 

00:02:31.529 --> 00:02:32.709
 and also 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.149
 you will enter another property ie 

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:38.299
 all those properties that we do not have the mind saved that will 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.289
 to enter with the loss of inverse dohuk 

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:44.059
 which is the opposite if we take an even number on pt multiply by 

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.949
 to release 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:47.949
 you realize that the universe of the other this is going to give a touch 

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:53.519
 we have to review with our fractions classes 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:58.200
 I killed that non-automatic people at 0 with 8 and also in classes of notions of 

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:59.159
 proportions 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:02.670
 which is a practice will be achieved because in these two patient classes 

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:05.279
 presented very important concepts 

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:07.519
 related to national assemblies 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.259
 so it's important that you access your two classes 

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:11.140
 beauty 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.159
 in another important thing in the addresses 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:17.000
 I do bieber naturally it can not be zero for us or we do not have the 

00:03:16.999 --> 00:03:19.929
 see only 

00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:23.650
 other observation but a part of the group of nationals 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.040
 that the vision operation is to be defined or 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.310
 mt in this set that the definition of division 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:35.759
 other representations 

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:39.849
 we see that the set of natural impulses he has risen with others 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:42.919
 internal kurt subset of passionais 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:47.930
 ie the previous clashes they will consult sets 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.589
 our luck 

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:54.529
 if we continue in this case they would anyway want the set 

00:03:54.529 --> 00:03:57.339
 of burials he is a subset 

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:58.170
 two 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.939
 rational 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:05.589
 there have now been people with the set of rational numbers represented by 

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:07.729
 letter p 

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:11.759
 the international ones are works that can not in thesis represented through 

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:14.179
 a reason these two integers 

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:18.039
 are numbers that are not rational and exactly why they will form 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:19.769
 the whole part 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.490
 the nationals they only expel a part of this not periotto evil 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.499
 the best ever has a part of that way the worst kind 

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:29.270
 for example by more than two 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.580
 he will be summoned to 41 42 125 and so on. 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.539
 more details 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:35.460
 also 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.169
 and that we will learn that intrigue name creates 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:40.409
 since noon 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:42.120
 So you realize that 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.500
 it was here we do not have a part of this evil 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.860
 that repeats 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.150
 when we learned fractions 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.280
 we have seen that when there is a periodic tithe 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.840
 this periodic tithe could always be presented by a number 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.750
 here because not because we do not have blair when married to a 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.900
 homer period that repeats itself 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.689
 with a numerical sequence that repeats over time 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:07.740
 agrees 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.020
 so because of this 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.639
 these numbers will serve national 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:17.100
 national flights with some seats are less than g2 - a cup3 g3 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.680
 or g7 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.800
 nÃ© personal care I have spoken - since 2000 it has fallen d - 2 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.669
 the ge - 2 will only be defined 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:28.360
 in the set of complexes 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.310
 - over 2km us that huge number here 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:32.259
 beauty 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:34.419
 - more than three months of drought 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:36.710
 number 90 and with the minus sign on the front 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.880
 these numbers with their pretty in front 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.880
 are perfectly defined 

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:47.540
 other representations, we note that the group of international 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:51.849
 they form a set the part has relation with all rational 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:53.469
 and we also note that 

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:58.240
 there are no elements of national citizens who are elements of the passionate and 

00:05:58.239 --> 00:06:00.059
 vice versa 

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:02.119
 because of this we are strong 

00:06:02.119 --> 00:06:05.929
 the intersection of the set of pins behind with national funds 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.809
 it's a little too empty or 

00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:09.750
 flirt 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.130
 elements in which the two sets
