today<00:00:05.400> Claire<00:00:05.910> and<00:00:06.240> I<00:00:06.299> are<00:00:06.480> in<00:00:06.540> the<00:00:06.629> prototype

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
today Claire and I are in the prototype

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.960 
today Claire and I are in the prototype
lab<00:00:07.140> and<00:00:07.410> we're<00:00:07.500> going<00:00:07.649> to<00:00:07.710> try<00:00:08.130> to<00:00:08.189> use<00:00:08.610> these

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
lab and we're going to try to use these

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.740 
lab and we're going to try to use these
materials<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:10.889> create<00:00:11.219> a<00:00:11.639> brush<00:00:12.150> spot<00:00:12.509> or<00:00:12.719> a

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
materials to create a brush spot or a

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.650 
materials to create a brush spot or a
bristlebot<00:00:13.259> if<00:00:13.559> you<00:00:13.650> wonder<00:00:13.799> what<00:00:13.889> that<00:00:14.070> is

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
bristlebot if you wonder what that is

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.040 
bristlebot if you wonder what that is
that<00:00:15.660> is<00:00:15.870> this<00:00:16.230> little<00:00:16.529> guy<00:00:16.890> right<00:00:17.180> here<00:00:18.180> what

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
that is this little guy right here what

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.599 
that is this little guy right here what
we're<00:00:19.170> trying<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.410> decide<00:00:19.680> right<00:00:19.859> now<00:00:19.920> is<00:00:20.400> if

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
we're trying to decide right now is if

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.300 
we're trying to decide right now is if
we<00:00:20.880> use<00:00:21.119> electrical<00:00:21.930> tape<00:00:21.990> is<00:00:22.529> that<00:00:22.590> enough<00:00:23.070> in

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
we use electrical tape is that enough in

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.029 
we use electrical tape is that enough in
order<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.760> put<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.630> leads<00:00:24.869> from<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.140> motor

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
order to put the leads from the motor

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.189 
order to put the leads from the motor
onto<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.670> battery<00:00:26.880> or<00:00:27.539> do<00:00:27.689> we<00:00:27.810> need<00:00:27.990> these

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
onto the battery or do we need these

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.620 
onto the battery or do we need these
little<00:00:28.470> battery<00:00:28.859> chases<00:00:29.490> that'll<00:00:30.240> hold<00:00:30.480> the

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
little battery chases that'll hold the

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.089 
little battery chases that'll hold the
battery<00:00:30.810> but<00:00:31.170> we'll<00:00:31.289> have<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.470> solder<00:00:31.830> in

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
battery but we'll have to solder in

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.670 
battery but we'll have to solder in
leaves<00:00:32.369> in<00:00:32.730> order<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:33.120> make<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:33.680> attach

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
leaves in order to make it attach

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.560 
leaves in order to make it attach
properly<00:00:34.920> but<00:00:35.700> then<00:00:35.880> we<00:00:36.000> have<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.239> added

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
properly but then we have the added

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.420 
properly but then we have the added
challenge<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:37.200> if<00:00:37.410> we<00:00:37.590> have<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.829> battery<00:00:38.160> in

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
challenge of if we have the battery in

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.700 
challenge of if we have the battery in
the<00:00:38.460> battery<00:00:38.850> case<00:00:39.180> does<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:39.960> necessarily<00:00:40.530> fit

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
the battery case does it necessarily fit

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.470 
the battery case does it necessarily fit
on<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.860> toothbrush<00:00:41.309> probably<00:00:41.760> not<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.329> it's

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
on the toothbrush probably not and it's

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.180 
on the toothbrush probably not and it's
an<00:00:42.570> added<00:00:42.780> cost<00:00:42.930> that's<00:00:43.770> something<00:00:44.070> we're

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
an added cost that's something we're

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.319 
an added cost that's something we're
struggling<00:00:44.370> with<00:00:44.640> we<00:00:44.820> also<00:00:44.969> have<00:00:45.149> double

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
struggling with we also have double

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.639 
struggling with we also have double
sided<00:00:45.510> foam<00:00:45.719> tape<00:00:45.960> we're<00:00:46.050> gonna<00:00:46.140> give<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.350> try

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
sided foam tape we're gonna give a try

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.690 
sided foam tape we're gonna give a try
and<00:00:46.950> possibly<00:00:47.129> copper<00:00:48.000> tape<00:00:49.129> okay<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.190> we<00:00:50.520> got

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
and possibly copper tape okay so we got

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.529 
and possibly copper tape okay so we got
the<00:00:51.170> battery<00:00:52.170> hooked<00:00:52.500> up<00:00:52.879> to<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:53.969> motor<00:00:54.180> and

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
the battery hooked up to the motor and

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.299 
the battery hooked up to the motor and
it's<00:00:54.989> interesting<00:00:55.199> just<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.649> watch<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:56.010> go<00:00:56.129> on

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
it's interesting just to watch it go on

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.439 
it's interesting just to watch it go on
and<00:00:56.460> throw<00:00:56.550> him<00:00:56.730> without<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.090> toothbrush

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
and throw him without the toothbrush

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.420 
and throw him without the toothbrush
attached<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:58.079> everything<00:00:58.320> naturally<00:00:58.829> has<00:00:59.010> a

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
attached it everything naturally has a

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.950 
attached it everything naturally has a
spin<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.420> doesn't<00:01:00.570> seem<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.840> go

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
spin to it it doesn't seem to go

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.210 
spin to it it doesn't seem to go
straight<00:01:02.120> and<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.690> tickles<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.140> lot<00:01:07.159> okay<00:01:08.159> so

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
straight and it tickles a lot okay so

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.170 
straight and it tickles a lot okay so
here<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.850> our<00:01:09.090> first<00:01:09.930> prototype<00:01:10.909> we<00:01:11.909> actually

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
here is our first prototype we actually

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.580 
here is our first prototype we actually
tried<00:01:12.390> putting<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.840> motor<00:01:13.049> on<00:01:13.229> top<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.530> the

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
tried putting the motor on top of the

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.870 
tried putting the motor on top of the
battery<00:01:13.860> first<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.220> can<00:01:14.310> see<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.490> tape<00:01:14.670> there

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
battery first you can see the tape there

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.670 
battery first you can see the tape there
and<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.450> wasn't<00:01:15.600> working<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:16.380> was<00:01:16.470> falling

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
and it wasn't working it was falling

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.260 
and it wasn't working it was falling
over<00:01:16.860> top<00:01:17.220> heavy<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:17.520> we<00:01:17.610> trim<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.880> bristles

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
over top heavy so we trim the bristles

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.660 
over top heavy so we trim the bristles
down<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:19.140> see<00:01:19.320> if<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.590> would<00:01:19.710> move<00:01:19.920> better<00:01:20.250> with

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
down to see if it would move better with

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.550 
down to see if it would move better with
the<00:01:20.790> shorter<00:01:21.090> leg<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.600> then<00:01:22.049> we<00:01:22.140> also<00:01:22.290> move

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
the shorter leg and then we also move

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.410 
the shorter leg and then we also move
the<00:01:22.680> motor<00:01:22.860> off<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.340> battery<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.970> I'm

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
the motor off the battery and I'm

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.789 
the motor off the battery and I'm
actually<00:01:24.600> working<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:25.080> lot<00:01:25.200> better<00:01:25.350> let's<00:01:25.619> put

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
actually working a lot better let's put

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.289 
actually working a lot better let's put
them<00:01:25.860> down

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
them down

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.710 
them down
okay<00:01:28.289> so<00:01:28.469> here<00:01:28.740> is<00:01:28.859> a<00:01:28.890> second<00:01:29.490> prototype

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
okay so here is a second prototype

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.320 
okay so here is a second prototype
here<00:01:32.720> is<00:01:32.869> a<00:01:32.900> second<00:01:33.530> prototype<00:01:33.920> and<00:01:34.460> this<00:01:35.000> one

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
here is a second prototype and this one

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.420 
here is a second prototype and this one
has<00:01:35.810> much<00:01:36.080> higher<00:01:36.140> legs<00:01:36.710> and<00:01:37.009> you<00:01:37.070> can<00:01:37.220> see

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
has much higher legs and you can see

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.520 
has much higher legs and you can see
it's<00:01:37.580> spinning<00:01:37.880> a<00:01:38.090> lot<00:01:38.270> faster<00:01:38.840> the<00:01:39.200> other<00:01:39.320> one

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
it's spinning a lot faster the other one

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.039 
it's spinning a lot faster the other one
okay<00:01:40.460> to<00:01:40.940> try<00:01:41.119> them<00:01:41.270> catch<00:01:41.450> them<00:01:41.659> here<00:01:41.810> you<00:01:41.930> can

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
okay to try them catch them here you can

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:43.480 
okay to try them catch them here you can
see<00:01:42.229> you've<00:01:42.380> got<00:01:42.409> about<00:01:42.740> double<00:01:43.070> the<00:01:43.220> length

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
see you've got about double the length

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.219 
see you've got about double the length
of<00:01:43.700> legs<00:01:43.970> slightly<00:01:44.420> different<00:01:44.720> to<00:01:44.840> fresh<00:01:45.080> as

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
of legs slightly different to fresh as

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.980 
of legs slightly different to fresh as
well<00:01:45.610> okay<00:01:48.880> okay<00:01:49.880> now<00:01:50.000> we're<00:01:50.119> gonna<00:01:50.210> test<00:01:50.509> and

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
well okay okay now we're gonna test and

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.380 
well okay okay now we're gonna test and
see<00:01:51.500> if<00:01:51.860> we<00:01:52.009> put<00:01:52.310> them<00:01:52.520> in<00:01:52.759> an<00:01:52.880> environment

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
see if we put them in an environment

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.029 
see if we put them in an environment
where<00:01:53.600> we<00:01:53.690> can<00:01:53.810> observe<00:01:53.930> their<00:01:54.409> track<00:01:54.710> just

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
where we can observe their track just

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:56.320 
where we can observe their track just
even<00:01:55.280> get<00:01:55.369> a<00:01:55.399> better<00:01:55.580> sense<00:01:55.880> of<00:01:56.090> their

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
even get a better sense of their

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.590 
even get a better sense of their
movement<00:01:56.960> patterns<00:01:57.340> okay<00:01:58.340> so<00:01:59.270> I'm<00:01:59.330> just<00:01:59.390> going

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
movement patterns okay so I'm just going

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.180 
movement patterns okay so I'm just going
to<00:01:59.659> put<00:01:59.840> them<00:02:00.020> into<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:00.649> box

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
to put them into the box

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.660 
to put them into the box
we<00:02:01.430> just<00:02:01.610> got<00:02:01.759> salt<00:02:02.149> in<00:02:02.299> the<00:02:02.450> sauce<00:02:03.460> okay<00:02:04.460> we've

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
we just got salt in the sauce okay we've

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.700 
we just got salt in the sauce okay we've
got<00:02:04.819> one<00:02:04.850> more<00:02:05.509> plate<00:02:06.020> to<00:02:06.140> add<00:02:06.319> to<00:02:06.440> the<00:02:06.560> mix

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
got one more plate to add to the mix

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:20.340 
got one more plate to add to the mix
here

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.810 

this<00:02:21.350> one<00:02:21.530> over<00:02:21.680> here<00:02:22.010> is<00:02:22.130> creating<00:02:22.490> a<00:02:22.520> kind<00:02:22.730> of

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
this one over here is creating a kind of

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.320 
this one over here is creating a kind of
like<00:02:23.000> then<00:02:23.440> repetitive<00:02:24.440> pattern<00:02:25.130> this<00:02:26.090> one

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
like then repetitive pattern this one

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.420 
like then repetitive pattern this one
just<00:02:26.660> seems<00:02:26.840> to<00:02:26.960> be<00:02:27.050> cleaning<00:02:27.380> in<00:02:27.740> here<00:02:28.010> he's

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
just seems to be cleaning in here he's

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.830 
just seems to be cleaning in here he's
like<00:02:28.670> tidying<00:02:29.060> up<00:02:29.210> and<00:02:29.420> this<00:02:29.510> one<00:02:29.690> is<00:02:29.750> just

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
like tidying up and this one is just

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.530 
like tidying up and this one is just
taking<00:02:30.170> over<00:02:30.380> territory
