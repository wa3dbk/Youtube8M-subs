drop at a time I didn't do one drop at a
time<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:23.100> did<00:01:23.250> like<00:01:23.369> three<00:01:23.520> um<00:01:23.909> but<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.570> used<00:01:24.780> a

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
time I did like three um but I used a

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.200 
time I did like three um but I used a
lot<00:01:24.960> less<00:01:25.170> than<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.380> think<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.830> did<00:01:26.070> before<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.850> I

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
lot less than I think I did before and I

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.719 
lot less than I think I did before and I
like<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.600> lot<00:01:27.630> more<00:01:27.750> so<00:01:28.530> this<00:01:28.890> brush<00:01:29.159> she<00:01:29.579> was

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
like it a lot more so this brush she was

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:30.980 
like it a lot more so this brush she was
even<00:01:30.030> telling<00:01:30.180> me<00:01:30.299> she<00:01:30.479> didn't<00:01:30.659> really<00:01:30.840> like

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
even telling me she didn't really like

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.510 
even telling me she didn't really like
this<00:01:31.170> brush<00:01:31.439> but<00:01:31.680> i<00:01:31.710> think<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.340> brush

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
this brush but i think that the brush

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.730 
this brush but i think that the brush
actually<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.240> was<00:01:34.020> thinking<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.560> brush

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
actually I was thinking that the brush

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.230 
actually I was thinking that the brush
was<00:01:34.770> kind<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.189> gimmicky<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.909> wasn't<00:01:36.119> gonna

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
was kind of gimmicky and it wasn't gonna

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.760 
was kind of gimmicky and it wasn't gonna
make<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> difference<00:01:36.810> but<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.020> do<00:01:37.110> actually<00:01:37.409> like

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
make a difference but I do actually like

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.800 
make a difference but I do actually like
