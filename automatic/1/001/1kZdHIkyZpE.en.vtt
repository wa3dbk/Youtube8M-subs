00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
chance all right would an epic battle

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.520 
chance all right would an epic battle
it's<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:00.940> longest<00:02:01.210> battle<00:02:01.930> in<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.320> history

it's the longest battle in the history

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.470 
it's the longest battle in the history
of<00:02:02.860> the<00:02:03.040> arena<00:02:03.250> and<00:02:03.520> I<00:02:03.610> probably<00:02:03.910> am<00:02:04.150> gonna<00:02:04.270> get

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
of the arena and I probably am gonna get

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.380 
of the arena and I probably am gonna get
a<00:02:04.510> loss<00:02:04.860> even<00:02:05.860> though<00:02:06.010> he<00:02:06.160> can't<00:02:06.400> finish<00:02:06.760> my

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
a loss even though he can't finish my

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.100 
a loss even though he can't finish my
shrine<00:02:07.720> I<00:02:08.050> was<00:02:08.560> always<00:02:08.709> curious<00:02:09.039> about<00:02:09.369> this

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
shrine I was always curious about this

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.809 
shrine I was always curious about this
but<00:02:11.110> I'm<00:02:11.440> assuming<00:02:11.920> loss<00:02:12.510> draws<00:02:13.510> a<00:02:13.659> loss<00:02:13.930> I

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
but I'm assuming loss draws a loss I

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.680 
but I'm assuming loss draws a loss I
don't<00:02:15.819> know<00:02:15.940> because<00:02:16.680> if<00:02:18.060> basically<00:02:19.060> we<00:02:19.269> both

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
don't know because if basically we both

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.900 
don't know because if basically we both
would<00:02:20.080> have

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.780
