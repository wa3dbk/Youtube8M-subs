when<00:00:04.600> we<00:00:04.779> implant<00:00:05.230> electrodes<00:00:05.979> into<00:00:06.310> brains

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:06.850 
when we implant electrodes into brains

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.379 
when we implant electrodes into brains
for<00:00:07.420> therapeutic<00:00:08.230> reasons<00:00:08.820> all<00:00:09.820> of<00:00:10.030> a<00:00:10.090> sudden

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:10.389 
for therapeutic reasons all of a sudden

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:12.150 
for therapeutic reasons all of a sudden
we<00:00:10.480> may<00:00:10.600> be<00:00:10.660> stimulating<00:00:11.320> regions<00:00:11.709> of<00:00:11.830> a<00:00:11.920> brain

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:12.160 
we may be stimulating regions of a brain

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.220 
we may be stimulating regions of a brain
and<00:00:12.430> that<00:00:13.029> means<00:00:13.209> we're<00:00:13.420> controlling<00:00:13.779> regions

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:14.230 
and that means we're controlling regions

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.880 
and that means we're controlling regions
of<00:00:14.350> the<00:00:14.410> brain<00:00:14.500> that<00:00:15.750> raises<00:00:16.750> some<00:00:17.050> ethical

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:17.890 
of the brain that raises some ethical

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:28.230 
of the brain that raises some ethical
concerns<00:00:26.310> if<00:00:27.310> I<00:00:27.460> can<00:00:27.610> just<00:00:27.789> parse<00:00:28.030> this<00:00:28.180> a

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
concerns if I can just parse this a

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.880 
concerns if I can just parse this a
little<00:00:28.390> bit<00:00:28.630> so<00:00:28.840> let<00:00:29.050> me<00:00:29.140> just<00:00:29.289> say<00:00:29.470> what<00:00:29.680> neuro

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
little bit so let me just say what neuro

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.890 
little bit so let me just say what neuro
engineering<00:00:30.580> is<00:00:30.760> it's<00:00:31.630> really<00:00:31.810> the

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
engineering is it's really the

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.479 
engineering is it's really the
confluence<00:00:32.529> of<00:00:32.619> three<00:00:32.770> domains

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:33.489 
confluence of three domains

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.349 
confluence of three domains
it's<00:00:33.610> the<00:00:33.910> confluence<00:00:34.449> of<00:00:35.159> neuroscience

00:00:36.349 --> 00:00:36.359 
it's the confluence of neuroscience

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:40.229 
it's the confluence of neuroscience
device<00:00:37.359> technology<00:00:37.719> and<00:00:38.530> computing<00:00:39.239> those

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
device technology and computing those

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.329 
device technology and computing those
three<00:00:40.600> together<00:00:40.780> form<00:00:41.350> this<00:00:41.559> sort<00:00:41.739> of<00:00:41.890> special

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:42.339 
three together form this sort of special

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:48.239 
three together form this sort of special
neural<00:00:43.120> engineering<00:00:43.300> domain<00:00:46.859> with<00:00:47.859> that

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:48.249 
neural engineering domain with that

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:51.329 
neural engineering domain with that
comes<00:00:48.969> some<00:00:49.269> ethical<00:00:49.839> issues<00:00:49.960> and<00:00:50.679> in<00:00:51.219> the

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:51.339 
comes some ethical issues and in the

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:53.009 
comes some ethical issues and in the
sciences<00:00:51.789> we're<00:00:51.999> going<00:00:52.149> to<00:00:52.210> benefit<00:00:52.659> from<00:00:52.899> a

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:53.019 
sciences we're going to benefit from a

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:54.989 
sciences we're going to benefit from a
partnership<00:00:53.350> with<00:00:54.339> ethicists<00:00:54.909> and

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:54.999 
partnership with ethicists and

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:58.439 
partnership with ethicists and
philosophers<00:00:56.489> so<00:00:57.489> scientists<00:00:57.999> are<00:00:58.179> trained

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
philosophers so scientists are trained

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:00.660 
philosophers so scientists are trained
to<00:00:58.510> do<00:00:58.690> science<00:00:59.170> and<00:00:59.379> it's<00:01:00.039> not<00:01:00.129> as<00:01:00.370> if<00:01:00.489> they

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
to do science and it's not as if they

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.369 
to do science and it's not as if they
can't<00:01:00.969> talk<00:01:01.210> about<00:01:01.269> values<00:01:01.839> questions<00:01:02.229> I<00:01:02.350> find

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
can't talk about values questions I find

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:04.289 
can't talk about values questions I find
generally<00:01:03.249> they're<00:01:03.399> very<00:01:03.549> interested<00:01:04.150> but

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299 
generally they're very interested but

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:06.180 
generally they're very interested but
they<00:01:04.479> don't<00:01:04.809> feel<00:01:04.960> trained<00:01:05.350> to<00:01:05.560> talk<00:01:05.740> about<00:01:05.890> it

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
they don't feel trained to talk about it

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.550 
they don't feel trained to talk about it
so<00:01:06.580> when<00:01:06.790> we<00:01:06.820> talk<00:01:07.180> to<00:01:07.420> the<00:01:07.960> scientists<00:01:08.439> and

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
so when we talk to the scientists and

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.319 
so when we talk to the scientists and
engineers<00:01:08.680> in<00:01:09.100> the<00:01:09.189> center<00:01:09.520> they<00:01:10.060> thought<00:01:10.240> it

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:10.329 
engineers in the center they thought it

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:11.609 
engineers in the center they thought it
was<00:01:10.420> really<00:01:10.539> important<00:01:10.960> to<00:01:11.020> do<00:01:11.170> something

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
was really important to do something

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:13.109 
was really important to do something
about<00:01:11.710> these<00:01:11.950> issues<00:01:12.159> but<00:01:12.490> they<00:01:12.640> didn't<00:01:12.939> feel

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
about these issues but they didn't feel

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.920 
about these issues but they didn't feel
prepared<00:01:13.600> to<00:01:13.719> do<00:01:13.930> it<00:01:14.110> themselves

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.990 

there<00:01:18.890> have<00:01:18.980> been<00:01:19.100> questions<00:01:19.310> about<00:01:19.640> or

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
there have been questions about or

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.970 
there have been questions about or
interest<00:01:20.900> anyway<00:01:21.230> in<00:01:21.410> doing<00:01:21.620> eat<00:01:21.770> brain

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
interest anyway in doing eat brain

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.310 
interest anyway in doing eat brain
stimulators<00:01:22.610> for<00:01:22.640> depression<00:01:23.510> but<00:01:23.690> now<00:01:24.080> let's

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
stimulators for depression but now let's

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.710 
stimulators for depression but now let's
say<00:01:24.560> it's<00:01:25.280> on<00:01:25.490> a<00:01:25.520> closed<00:01:25.880> loop<00:01:26.150> so<00:01:26.420> anytime

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
say it's on a closed loop so anytime

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.260 
say it's on a closed loop so anytime
your<00:01:27.230> levels<00:01:27.830> neurotransmitter<00:01:28.760> levels<00:01:28.820> or

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
your levels neurotransmitter levels or

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.690 
your levels neurotransmitter levels or
electrical<00:01:29.870> activity<00:01:30.290> levels<00:01:30.650> go<00:01:31.250> down<00:01:31.490> below

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
electrical activity levels go down below

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.490 
electrical activity levels go down below
a<00:01:31.820> certain<00:01:32.030> level<00:01:32.300> it<00:01:32.600> automatically<00:01:33.110> boosts

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
a certain level it automatically boosts

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.860 
a certain level it automatically boosts
you<00:01:33.590> back<00:01:33.770> up<00:01:34.010> that<00:01:34.280> might<00:01:35.060> be<00:01:35.210> good<00:01:35.420> but<00:01:35.780> on

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
you back up that might be good but on

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.180 
you back up that might be good but on
the<00:01:35.990> other<00:01:36.080> hand<00:01:36.170> something<00:01:36.680> bad<00:01:36.950> could

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
the other hand something bad could

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.920 
the other hand something bad could
happen<00:01:37.220> in<00:01:37.580> your<00:01:37.670> life<00:01:37.820> your<00:01:38.030> mother<00:01:38.180> dies<00:01:38.420> of

happen in your life your mother dies of

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.650 
happen in your life your mother dies of
course<00:01:39.290> you<00:01:39.470> should<00:01:39.650> feel<00:01:39.950> poorly<00:01:40.700> you<00:01:41.540> would

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
course you should feel poorly you would

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.810 
course you should feel poorly you would
expect<00:01:42.080> that<00:01:42.200> but<00:01:42.800> then<00:01:43.010> if<00:01:43.190> your<00:01:43.340> levels<00:01:43.670> go

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
expect that but then if your levels go

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.370 
expect that but then if your levels go
down<00:01:44.030> and<00:01:44.300> your<00:01:44.450> machine<00:01:44.840> automatically

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
down and your machine automatically

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.800 
down and your machine automatically
boosts<00:01:45.770> you<00:01:45.830> back<00:01:46.010> up<00:01:46.450> right

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
boosts you back up right

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.050 
boosts you back up right

from<00:02:17.290> disability<00:02:17.860> studies<00:02:18.189> is<00:02:18.340> we<00:02:18.489> have<00:02:18.640> a<00:02:18.819> lot

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
from disability studies is we have a lot

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.850 
from disability studies is we have a lot
of<00:02:19.299> investment<00:02:19.840> in<00:02:19.930> these<00:02:20.079> technologies<00:02:20.439> that

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
of investment in these technologies that

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.500 
of investment in these technologies that
are<00:02:21.010> intended<00:02:21.549> to<00:02:21.790> help<00:02:21.970> people<00:02:22.120> with

a wheelchair right if there's a problem
it's<00:02:50.560> that<00:02:50.799> and<00:02:51.190> not<00:02:51.489> enough<00:02:51.760> places<00:02:52.030> are

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
it's that and not enough places are

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.129 
it's that and not enough places are
accessible<00:02:52.389> and<00:02:52.959> we<00:02:53.019> need<00:02:53.170> to<00:02:53.290> work<00:02:53.409> on<00:02:53.590> that
