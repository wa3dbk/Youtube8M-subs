video gate here
I<00:00:55.100> changed<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.190> levels<00:00:56.520> around<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.879> little<00:00:57.000> bit

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
over here so hopefully things sound a

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.459 
over here so hopefully things sound a

scope all opened up and I can see my

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.300 
scope all opened up and I can see my
positive<00:01:21.780> Peaks<00:01:22.320> are<00:01:22.500> kind<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.740> weird<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.250> my

negative Peaks aren't really going all
the<00:01:24.810> way<00:01:25.280> because<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.460> radio<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:26.820> not

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
the way because the radio is not

some recuperating to do in that short

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.730 
some recuperating to do in that short
amount<00:04:07.180> of<00:04:07.390> time<00:04:07.450> by<00:04:07.990> no<00:04:08.050> means<00:04:08.410> is<00:04:08.620> the

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990 
antenna important and either one of them

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
antenna important and either one of them
yours<00:04:11.230> or<00:04:11.470> the<00:04:11.710> tree<00:04:12.280> element<00:04:12.660> so<00:04:13.660> by<00:04:14.260> no<00:04:14.650> means

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
yours or the tree element so by no means

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.150 
yours or the tree element so by no means
do<00:04:15.220> you<00:04:15.280> need<00:04:15.430> to<00:04:15.520> work<00:04:15.670> on<00:04:15.850> that<00:04:16.769> take<00:04:17.769> time<00:04:18.010> to

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
do you need to work on that take time to

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.580 
do you need to work on that take time to
recuperate<00:04:18.580> man<00:04:18.910> and<00:04:19.150> uh<00:04:19.180> you<00:04:19.810> know<00:04:19.930> just<00:04:20.410> take

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
recuperate man and uh you know just take

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.890 
recuperate man and uh you know just take
it<00:04:20.739> easy<00:04:20.860> and<00:04:21.400> keep<00:04:22.150> off<00:04:22.330> of<00:04:22.360> it<00:04:22.660> that's<00:04:22.810> the

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
it easy and keep off of it that's the

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.770 
it easy and keep off of it that's the
best<00:04:23.050> thing<00:04:23.200> you<00:04:23.320> can<00:04:23.440> do<00:04:23.590> probably<00:04:24.100> I'm

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
best thing you can do probably I'm

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.910 
best thing you can do probably I'm
guessing<00:04:25.780> there's<00:04:26.140> not<00:04:26.260> a<00:04:26.290> whole<00:04:26.530> lot<00:04:26.740> they

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
guessing there's not a whole lot they

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.550 
guessing there's not a whole lot they
can<00:04:26.980> do<00:04:27.190> you<00:04:27.490> know<00:04:27.780> but<00:04:28.780> if<00:04:29.200> you're<00:04:29.380> already

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
can do you know but if you're already

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.290 
can do you know but if you're already
feeling<00:04:29.860> better<00:04:30.190> by<00:04:30.400> staying<00:04:30.640> off<00:04:30.820> of<00:04:31.000> it<00:04:31.120> my

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
feeling better by staying off of it my

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.850 
feeling better by staying off of it my
guess<00:04:31.510> is<00:04:31.690> it'll<00:04:31.870> keep<00:04:32.230> on<00:04:32.410> going<00:04:32.710> that

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
guess is it'll keep on going that

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.630 
guess is it'll keep on going that
direction<00:04:33.010> so<00:04:33.660> good<00:04:34.660> deal<00:04:34.840> on<00:04:35.050> that<00:04:35.290> and<00:04:35.640> what

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
direction so good deal on that and what

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.290 
direction so good deal on that and what
else<00:04:36.850> would<00:04:37.060> say<00:04:37.240> here<00:04:38.730> and<00:04:39.730> I<00:04:39.940> don't<00:04:40.150> whole

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
else would say here and I don't whole

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.770 
else would say here and I don't whole

because<00:05:48.140> I<00:05:48.350> could<00:05:48.500> see<00:05:48.620> it<00:05:48.710> on<00:05:48.770> the<00:05:48.890> scope<00:05:49.160> it

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310 
because I could see it on the scope it

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.970 
because I could see it on the scope it
was<00:05:49.430> moving<00:05:49.730> the<00:05:49.820> whole<00:05:49.940> time<00:05:50.530> anyway<00:05:51.530> so<00:05:51.740> my

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:51.980 
was moving the whole time anyway so my

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.910 
was moving the whole time anyway so my
receive<00:05:52.670> audio<00:05:52.870> coming<00:05:53.870> off<00:05:53.960> my<00:05:54.200> Panasonic

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:54.920 
receive audio coming off my Panasonic

00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:01.510 
receive audio coming off my Panasonic
receiver<00:05:57.730> because<00:05:58.730> that<00:05:59.000> every<00:05:59.390> so<00:05:59.570> often<00:06:00.520> it

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
receiver because that every so often it

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.640 
receiver because that every so often it
disappears<00:06:02.180> so<00:06:03.050> I<00:06:03.080> lose<00:06:03.350> it<00:06:03.500> in<00:06:03.560> the

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650 
disappears so I lose it in the

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:04.990 
disappears so I lose it in the
headphones<00:06:04.070> so<00:06:04.310> when<00:06:04.430> I<00:06:04.460> lose<00:06:04.700> it<00:06:04.850> in<00:06:04.970> the

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 
headphones so when I lose it in the

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.690 
headphones so when I lose it in the
headphones<00:06:05.420> of<00:06:05.810> course<00:06:06.050> the<00:06:06.230> computer<00:06:06.700> also

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:07.700 
headphones of course the computer also

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.230 
headphones of course the computer also
stops<00:06:08.330> recording<00:06:08.960> it<00:06:09.160> so<00:06:10.160> I<00:06:10.700> gotta<00:06:11.060> figure

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 
stops recording it so I gotta figure

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.780 
stops recording it so I gotta figure
that<00:06:11.360> one<00:06:11.630> out<00:06:11.800> you<00:06:12.800> know<00:06:12.860> if<00:06:13.250> it's<00:06:13.430> not<00:06:13.490> one

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:13.790 
that one out you know if it's not one

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:14.560 
that one out you know if it's not one
thing<00:06:13.820> it's<00:06:14.120> another

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:14.570 
thing it's another

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.600 
thing it's another
and<00:06:15.560> I<00:06:15.650> could<00:06:15.800> see<00:06:15.980> why<00:06:16.100> more<00:06:16.310> people<00:06:16.430> don't

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610 
and I could see why more people don't

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.640 
and I could see why more people don't
have<00:06:16.880> crazy<00:06:17.150> stations<00:06:17.780> like<00:06:17.930> this<00:06:18.169> there<00:06:18.410> and

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:18.650 
have crazy stations like this there and

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:24.410 
have crazy stations like this there and
