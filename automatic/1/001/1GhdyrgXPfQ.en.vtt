00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.780
 Yes 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.719
 this is primary school in the pressure bar 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:14.090
 lead the only jenaplan school 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.860
 in the city as the name indicates beets 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.990
 this the alt a safe place where 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.119
 children can learn to according to one 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.880
 continuous roster and the principles of it 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.320
 learn jenaplan with and from each other 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.810
 the ducdalf finds it important that 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.310
 children feel at home at school 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.140
 and that education is in line with the 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.279
 interests and possibilities from here 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.170
 single child 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.790
 teachers are incredibly easy 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.950
 approachable and which is also very nice 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.960
 is that you as a parent can also help a lot 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.880
 You also say in the activity had 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.960
 you need a lot of help as a parent 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.870
 involved in the school 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.370
 I really like them 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.670
 being busy all the time with innovative 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.350
 concepts the education they have now 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.760
 that it is constantly changing 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.449
 to make sure it gets the most out 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.430
 children mourn 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:55.989
 I think there is nothing better than one 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.300
 high-quality school are true 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.250
 such a nice attractive 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.079
 atmosphere and where just fun 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.489
 the dalfsen pressure knows no 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.979
 class but tribal groups 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.630
 now there are children in a tribe group 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.360
 different ages together 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.280
 the youngest children learn from the elderly 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.270
 while those in turn learn from 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.680
 the youngest 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.960
 this way a child learns to be responsible 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.580
 to lead and to lead 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.350
 accept 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.880
 all activities fall on the ducdalf 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.649
 below 4 starting points 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.649
 specifically aimed at jenaplan education 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:30.340
 talking is one of the most important 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.869
 expression options 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.940
 Through conversations a child learns to 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.159
 to listen to others and one 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.080
 opinion our school knows 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.460
 different types of conversations 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.050
 for example a reading circle or 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.050
 circle discussion about a specific theme 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.619
 the ducdalf is something game especially as one 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.300
 stimulate and challenge activity to 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.770
 we want to surrender 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.399
 children could develop on it 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.989
 sporty creative and social area 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.300
 the ducdalf causes children 

00:01:55.989 --> 00:02:00.550
 learn their own possibilities so much 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.050
 possible to discover and develop 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.050
 there is a lot of attention for independence 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.330
 and the individual child is in education 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.849
 subdivided into a quiet working period and 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.560
 a blog period in the silent period 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:14.230
 is counted there and are the children 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.000
 engaged in language teaching during the 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.900
 children can be within one 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.940
 certain theme 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.260
 choose what they are going to do there 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.440
 cooperated a lot 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.790
 thanks also partying is also something you 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.800
 learns at our school 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.239
 the emphasis is on something 4 in together 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.489
 A good atmosphere 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.819
 this gives a sense of togetherness 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.879
 No 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.769
 then use the car 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:37.209
 we attach great importance to silent and 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.700
 work quietly 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.769
 print the creates so cozy safe 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.109
 and quiet learning environment 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.459
 we also work closely with parents 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:46.959
 For example, parents are involved with 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.340
 theme nights 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:52.469
 this creates a bond between the 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.469
 children parents and group leaders 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.590
 students of the bubbles they 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.420
 independently responsible and social 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.340
 concerned 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.900
