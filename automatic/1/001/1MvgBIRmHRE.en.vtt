00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
was just god-awful so I repainted it I

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.330 
was just god-awful so I repainted it I
did<00:03:21.600> make<00:03:21.780> one<00:03:21.930> mistake<00:03:22.080> because<00:03:22.620> I<00:03:22.800> intended

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
did make one mistake because I intended

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.580 
did make one mistake because I intended
to<00:03:23.450> eventually<00:03:24.450> put<00:03:24.600> decals<00:03:24.840> on<00:03:25.440> this

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
to eventually put decals on this

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.390 
to eventually put decals on this
locomotive<00:03:25.890> and<00:03:26.840> I<00:03:27.840> found<00:03:28.230> out<00:03:28.440> that<00:03:28.680> gloss

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
locomotive and I found out that gloss

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.759 
locomotive and I found out that gloss
paint<00:03:29.880> is<00:03:30.090> what<00:03:30.330> you<00:03:30.480> need<00:03:30.720> to<00:03:31.140> use<00:03:31.170> to<00:03:31.650> add

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769

decals<00:03:32.340> I<00:03:32.750> use<00:03:33.750> flat<00:03:34.200> black<00:03:34.620> instead<00:03:35.010> of<00:03:35.070> gloss

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
decals I use flat black instead of gloss

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.970 
decals I use flat black instead of gloss
black<00:03:35.930> so<00:03:36.930> I'm<00:03:37.320> either<00:03:37.500> going<00:03:37.709> to<00:03:37.769> have<00:03:37.830> to
