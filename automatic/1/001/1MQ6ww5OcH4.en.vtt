00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
the hype limit so that'll be however

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.130 
the hype limit so that'll be however
high<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:24.150> from<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.449> level<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:24.779> built<00:00:24.960> it

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
high it is from the level you built it

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.500 
each side of the door is 9 blocks or 8
blocks<00:00:29.060> so<00:00:30.060> that<00:00:30.330> would<00:00:30.480> be<00:00:30.630> 19<00:00:31.320> wide<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.890> it's

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:32.510 
blocks so that would be 19 wide and it's

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.020 
blocks so that would be 19 wide and it's
43<00:00:33.510> long<00:00:34.170> already<00:00:34.559> know<00:00:34.770> it's<00:00:34.950> 9<00:00:35.160> blocks<00:00:35.370> the

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
front of it is 9 blocks on each side I

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.330 
front of it is 9 blocks on each side I
get<00:00:38.579> confused<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.300> then<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.410> door<00:00:40.680> included

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
blocks it's 43 long and then you've got

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.250 
blocks it's 43 long and then you've got
a<00:00:45.270> ladder<00:00:45.570> going<00:00:45.980> all<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.070> way<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.430> top

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
a ladder going all the way to the top

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.799 
a ladder going all the way to the top
right<00:00:49.260> in<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.410> middle<00:00:50.480> the<00:00:51.480> inside<00:00:53.420> of<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.660> the

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
right in the middle the inside of it the

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.420 
right in the middle the inside of it the
torches<00:00:55.230> don't<00:00:55.530> need<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.739> be<00:00:55.829> perfect<00:00:56.070> but

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
torches don't need to be perfect but

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.349 
torches don't need to be perfect but
here<00:00:56.640> we've<00:00:56.760> got<00:00:57.079> six<00:00:58.079> blocks<00:00:58.609> or<00:00:59.609> five<00:00:59.879> six

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
here we've got six blocks or five six

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.630 
here we've got six blocks or five six
blocks<00:01:00.719> on<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.649> torch<00:01:01.920> including<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.430> torch

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
blocks on the torch including the torch

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.729 
blocks on the torch including the torch
and<00:01:02.879> then<00:01:03.449> each<00:01:03.629> one<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:03.960> separated<00:01:04.409> by<00:01:04.530> nine

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
and then each one is separated by nine

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.130 
and then each one is separated by nine
but<00:01:05.610> then<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:06.119> have<00:01:06.299> this<00:01:06.479> pattern<00:01:06.780> right

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
but then you have this pattern right

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.719 
but then you have this pattern right
here<00:01:07.170> with<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.680> with<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.280> bed<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.640> the

here with the with the bed and the
torches<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.360> then<00:01:10.320> that's<00:01:10.500> also<00:01:10.710> six<00:01:11.130> blocks

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
torches and then that's also six blocks

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.679 
torches and then that's also six blocks
including<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.560> torch<00:01:13.830> placement<00:01:14.630> and<00:01:15.630> it

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
including the torch placement and it

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.590 
including the torch placement and it
goes<00:01:15.900> down<00:01:16.080> it's<00:01:16.290> not<00:01:16.470> really<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.890> important

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
goes down it's not really that important

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.380 
goes down it's not really that important
but<00:01:18.600> it's<00:01:19.229> hard<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.650> see<00:01:19.830> what<00:01:20.009> they<00:01:20.159> have<00:01:20.390> so

that you can see like the corners of it

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.520 
that you can see like the corners of it
it's<00:04:42.430> not<00:04:42.610> exactly<00:04:43.240> perfect<00:04:43.570> because<00:04:44.350> you<00:04:44.500> can

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
it's not exactly perfect because you can

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.409 
it's not exactly perfect because you can
see<00:04:44.890> that<00:04:45.070> it's<00:04:45.220> not<00:04:45.400> the<00:04:45.850> circle<00:04:46.210> isn't

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
see that it's not the circle isn't

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.580 
see that it's not the circle isn't
perfect<00:04:46.720> but<00:04:47.260> here's<00:04:47.470> the<00:04:47.620> left<00:04:48.000> corner<00:04:49.000> of<00:04:49.240> it

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
perfect but here's the left corner of it

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:58.469 
perfect but here's the left corner of it
if<00:04:50.590> you<00:04:50.830> need<00:04:51.010> to<00:04:51.190> pause<00:04:51.850> that<00:04:57.000> you<00:04:58.000> need<00:04:58.180> lime

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
if you need to pause that you need lime

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:01.890 
if you need to pause that you need lime

and<00:05:02.440> I<00:05:02.530> think<00:05:02.800> that's<00:05:02.979> it<00:05:03.160> you<00:05:03.340> can<00:05:03.460> see<00:05:03.610> how

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
and I think that's it you can see how

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:05.550 
and I think that's it you can see how
that<00:05:03.760> pressure<00:05:04.090> plate<00:05:04.540> is<00:05:04.690> on<00:05:04.900> the<00:05:05.080> logo<00:05:05.260> so

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
that pressure plate is on the logo so

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.110 
that pressure plate is on the logo so
make<00:05:05.710> sure<00:05:05.740> when<00:05:06.010> you<00:05:06.040> do<00:05:06.280> put<00:05:06.490> the<00:05:06.520> TNT<00:05:06.910> under

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
make sure when you do put the TNT under

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.880 
make sure when you do put the TNT under
and<00:05:07.600> all<00:05:08.380> the<00:05:08.860> TNT<00:05:09.370> is<00:05:09.700> our<00:05:10.360> I<00:05:11.350> think<00:05:11.410> it's

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
and all the TNT is our I think it's

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.200 
and all the TNT is our I think it's
three<00:05:12.840> rows<00:05:13.840> of<00:05:14.440> like<00:05:14.680> just<00:05:15.280> a<00:05:15.340> complete<00:05:15.700> slate

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
three rows of like just a complete slate

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.350 
three rows of like just a complete slate
three<00:05:16.930> slates<00:05:17.440> of<00:05:17.740> TNT<00:05:18.430> underneath<00:05:18.850> the<00:05:19.000> logo

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
three slates of TNT underneath the logo

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.020 
three slates of TNT underneath the logo
and<00:05:19.570> then<00:05:19.720> you<00:05:19.840> connect<00:05:20.200> it<00:05:20.380> with<00:05:20.410> the<00:05:21.030> button

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
and then you connect it with the button

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.770 
and then you connect it with the button
on<00:05:22.090> side<00:05:22.419> obviously<00:05:23.669> so<00:05:24.669> there<00:05:25.180> you<00:05:25.419> have<00:05:25.600> it

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
on side obviously so there you have it

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.540 
on side obviously so there you have it
that's<00:05:26.110> the<00:05:26.410> logo<00:05:26.560> that's<00:05:26.919> how<00:05:27.070> you<00:05:27.130> build<00:05:27.400> a

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
that's the logo that's how you build a

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.960 
that's the logo that's how you build a
