upgrade all the p.o eyes which it didn't

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.870 
upgrade all the p.o eyes which it didn't
I<00:02:30.390> mean<00:02:30.959> if<00:02:31.350> you<00:02:31.530> look<00:02:31.740> over<00:02:31.980> there<00:02:32.430> it<00:02:32.700> still

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
I mean if you look over there it still

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.010 
I mean if you look over there it still
says<00:02:33.000> there's<00:02:33.209> a<00:02:33.240> restaurant<00:02:33.480> there<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:33.900> that

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
says there's a restaurant there and that

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.090 
says there's a restaurant there and that
restaurant<00:02:34.140> hasn't<00:02:34.440> been<00:02:34.650> there<00:02:34.770> for<00:02:34.920> 10

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
years so um I just think it's the

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.630 
years so um I just think it's the
database<00:02:39.209> that<00:02:39.420> they're<00:02:39.540> getting<00:02:39.630> it<00:02:39.840> from<00:02:40.640> in

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
database that they're getting it from in

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.110 
database that they're getting it from in
the<00:02:42.030> audio<00:02:42.450> section<00:02:42.780> um<00:02:43.550> one<00:02:44.550> of<00:02:44.640> my<00:02:44.730> favorite

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
the audio section um one of my favorite

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.400 
the audio section um one of my favorite
