idea the passion of actually achieving
something<00:02:16.030> may<00:02:16.240> seem<00:02:16.570> quite<00:02:16.900> impossible<00:02:17.170> at

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
something may seem quite impossible at

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.100 
something may seem quite impossible at
the<00:02:17.590> time<00:02:17.940> so<00:02:18.940> it's<00:02:19.240> almost<00:02:19.390> like<00:02:19.540> theater

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
the time so it's almost like theater

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.860 
the time so it's almost like theater
it's<00:02:20.440> like<00:02:20.620> stage<00:02:21.000> we're<00:02:22.000> actually<00:02:22.180> producing

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
it's like stage we're actually producing

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.150 
it's like stage we're actually producing
a<00:02:23.770> constant<00:02:24.580> movie<00:02:24.970> or<00:02:25.620> but<00:02:26.620> I<00:02:26.650> think<00:02:26.890> that's<00:02:27.040> a

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
a constant movie or but I think that's a

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.040 
a constant movie or but I think that's a
lot<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:27.490> do<00:02:27.640> with<00:02:27.790> retailing<00:02:28.240> nowadays<00:02:28.690> if<00:02:28.870> you

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.810 
understand that you're creating your
fantasy<00:02:32.010> that's<00:02:33.010> something<00:02:33.370> that<00:02:33.520> gets<00:02:33.670> me
