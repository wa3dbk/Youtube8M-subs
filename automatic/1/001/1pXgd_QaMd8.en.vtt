alright<00:01:52.550> it<00:01:53.550> looks<00:01:53.580> really<00:01:54.090> good<00:01:54.240> though<00:01:54.650> um<00:01:55.650> I

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
alright it looks really good though um I

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.400

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
gonna paint these but it's kind of my

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.009 
gonna paint these but it's kind of my
excuse<00:02:14.730> if<00:02:14.850> I<00:02:14.910> get<00:02:15.120> pulled<00:02:15.300> over<00:02:15.480> for<00:02:15.660> it<00:02:15.959> I

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
excuse if I get pulled over for it I

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.660 
excuse if I get pulled over for it I
just<00:02:16.230> say<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.620> bracket<00:02:17.370> rusted<00:02:17.760> off<00:02:17.959> so<00:02:18.959> now

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
just say the bracket rusted off so now

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.699 
just say the bracket rusted off so now
right<00:02:20.670> in<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.090> passenger<00:02:21.810> side<00:02:21.989> visor<00:02:22.320> I

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
right in the passenger side visor I

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.860 
right in the passenger side visor I
think<00:02:23.550> that's<00:02:23.730> a<00:02:23.850> great<00:02:24.090> spot<00:02:24.390> for<00:02:24.750> it

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
think that's a great spot for it

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.160 
think that's a great spot for it
honestly<00:02:25.440> because<00:02:26.330> it's<00:02:27.330> more<00:02:27.540> visible<00:02:27.930> than

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
honestly because it's more visible than

know<00:05:32.630> um<00:05:33.430> I<00:05:34.430> had<00:05:34.850> to<00:05:34.970> keep<00:05:35.120> tightening<00:05:35.690> them

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
know um I had to keep tightening them

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.240 
know um I had to keep tightening them
for<00:05:36.410> a<00:05:36.440> while<00:05:36.970> last<00:05:37.970> thing<00:05:38.210> I<00:05:38.300> want<00:05:38.480> is<00:05:38.630> a<00:05:38.660> wheel

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
for a while last thing I want is a wheel

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:44.560 
for a while last thing I want is a wheel

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
falling off on the highway um because I

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.940 
falling off on the highway um because I
faced<00:05:44.840> the<00:05:45.020> subs<00:05:45.290> backwards<00:05:45.860> I<00:05:46.160> had<00:05:46.460> to<00:05:46.669> I<00:05:47.950> had

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
faced the subs backwards I had to I had

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.550 
faced the subs backwards I had to I had

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 
to get a new license plate frame that

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.280 
to get a new license plate frame that
was<00:05:51.680> thicker<00:05:52.130> and<00:05:52.660> then<00:05:53.660> tighten<00:05:54.080> up<00:05:54.140> these

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.290 
was thicker and then tighten up these

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.620 
was thicker and then tighten up these
bolts<00:05:54.650> a<00:05:54.740> little<00:05:54.770> bit<00:05:55.070> to<00:05:55.220> keep<00:05:55.430> it<00:05:55.610> keep<00:05:56.450> it

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:56.630 
bolts a little bit to keep it keep it

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:01.350 
bolts a little bit to keep it keep it
from<00:05:56.750> vibrating<00:05:57.880> so<00:05:58.880> it's<00:05:59.240> pretty<00:05:59.450> solid<00:05:59.690> now

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
from vibrating so it's pretty solid now

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.880 
from vibrating so it's pretty solid now
that's<00:06:02.360> pretty<00:06:02.570> much<00:06:02.690> it<00:06:02.930> on<00:06:03.020> the<00:06:03.169> outside<00:06:03.560> I

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:03.890 
that's pretty much it on the outside I

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:07.610 
that's pretty much it on the outside I
haven't<00:06:04.700> done<00:06:04.790> much<00:06:04.970> other<00:06:05.419> than<00:06:06.110> that

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
haven't done much other than that

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:12.830 
haven't done much other than that
so<00:06:09.350> let's<00:06:10.350> check<00:06:10.650> out<00:06:10.860> the<00:06:11.160> interior<00:06:11.280> I<00:06:11.940> don't

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
so let's check out the interior I don't

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.740 
so let's check out the interior I don't
think<00:06:13.020> I've<00:06:13.110> really<00:06:13.380> done<00:06:13.530> much<00:06:14.540> could<00:06:15.540> use<00:06:15.720> a

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
think I've really done much could use a
