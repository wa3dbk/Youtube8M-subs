 hello good evening hi everyone 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.820
 here reiger we find ourselves today 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.809
 for a review of another trailer so 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.580
 the trailer I went to get it 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.599
 far so you explain look for all 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.429
 disputes today a thesis that 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.289
 was exit is chocked out and I'm 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.230
 fell on a guy who intrigues me and so 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.930
 with the title it's here he tells you yes this 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.800
 do not go well one piece dance 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.660
 battle me I did that I was serious 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.960
 they left there so I click 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.130
 the video lasts a minute and I can 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.649
 tell you it was a twenty minute 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.000
 the weirdest of my life you're already acting 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.860
 I already had moments of blizzard 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 style or I'm too stupid when I 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.719
 even been able to stop erecting people 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.129
 take for a madman 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.739
 stuff like that but it lasts about 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.610
 30 seconds the acei minutes grain and you 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:51.149
 look at the head trailer and he says no 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.379
 it's not possible and and baba cisse 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.100
 it's possible it's quite 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.690
 possible so the trailer is simple 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.390
 so we start we see the girls who 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.940
 dance on under a buy in with 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.290
 the money that falls all that I could 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.750
 finance like that to snuff dinan did it 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.520
 he died the feed that in this game 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.810
 this is not the fit I know 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.909
 luff it's not the well four price the 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.560
 rubber that masters the acquis that 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.330
 spend two years to train ccsa 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.830
 his evil twin a guy who wants 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.200
 to believe that it is him to do 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.610
 fall out of his reputation and not because I 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.869
 you say that but is critical of a 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.390
 minimum power 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.189
 the son is dead it's not the fit 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.600
 in the game so here is so then he 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.070

 body of a friend are not bending over me 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.250
 the dance side and the music side that 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.750
 should put on time I against 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.070
 the body of a friend is well done there is 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.430

 why dance like a bitch 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.570
 strip tease watch that's what they 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.480
 think of paranoid male fans 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.959
 So here I am, I have a little 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.269
 impressions 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.430
 oh yes I forgot - eat watch the 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.130
 trailer on my console he swears to you that 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.110
 while 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.550
 I looked at the trailer I think at the same 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.200
 time my console I was afraid they 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.030
 plant actually the trailer was 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.050
 so bad I was scared they 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.190
 plant because in addition these 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.950
 Thuan plants a bit for nothing when I 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.150
 look at stuff on the internet but I 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.740
 told me these are these plants I the 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.900
 understand the steel plan three months 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.030
 I understand it so here is loose 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.140
 So here gm kept my impressions 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.130
 on the trailer now i'm going to do 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.570
 for and against 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.160
 do I go so yes what 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.930
 had to be named and so these parts 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.430
 first the counter because it's a bit 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.460
 what I spend at the beginning this game is going 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:06.190
 to be a big shit again it's not 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.540
 one is not kind no no there is no 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.950
 of apology this game showcase just a 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.750
 big shit the teeth are they less 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.520
 rotten music has maintained China 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.930
 so at first I told myself yeah 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.490
 music popular J-pop even if 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.260
 it's the same c and j-pop music 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.670
 People who come what football 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.650
 in one piece press that are not fair 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.180
 a just dance when and just dance japan 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.560
 you see that's why are they 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.560
 want to put us less a track 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.390
 in his then I thought a game of 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.850
 dance as she played in the 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:33.420
 the only one I actually played in just dance 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.680
 for example these people talk a lot 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.240
 one more stop with your friends with 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.260
 tapped the study years you break you are 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.240
 everyone is happy everyone 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.770
 laughter you look like an idiot but you 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.200
 all the cases of the congo you are happy 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.930
 Savage a smartphone ie 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.550
 a smartphone on samsung on android 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.920
 on iphone all that you have a player 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.420
 stranger you're just going to look con so 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.000
 I do not know you write you press on 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.380
 keys or and dance not dancing in 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.240
 do not care why I paid for 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.950
 sub for this shit game that's all 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.140
 that you will see as reaction so 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:05.050
 that's it and so here it is 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.520
 near all the negative sides the game he 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.640
 is itself a negative side in itself 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.900
 but then the idea here in Iraq six in 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:14.980
 sea ​​and a passing game for the pot 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:17.650
 the idea of ​​the dance game on a track ok 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.270
 it's good to be part of a just thing 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.180
 with a guy who ran aground on the shooter 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.470
 with coke all this but 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.940
 after india thinking about it the idea can 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.889
 be good in the sense that if we 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.479
 reconcile the story of one piece and 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:30.000
 that we do with every run you see I have 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:30.720
 100% take without a headache or at 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.220
 place to fight 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.800
 the characters compete in 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.330
 battles is here that to be magic 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.100
 what would not pose is to take a 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.930
 story for example girl and meeting 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.160

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.650
 a fucking good idea actually in 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:48.840
 reality they can not do my thing 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:51.450
 but here and now the 

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.920
 final conclusion of all this but the 

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.870
 thing is, it's not if they 're not going 

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:57.390
 do a show they have it's going to be a 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:58.800
 commercial product right away they 

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:00.840
 are going to put music moving 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.520
 a little bit and some country characters 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.460
 favorite ie already the crew in 

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.390
 whole the ace 

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.380
 all the characters that everyone 

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:09.690

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:15.870
