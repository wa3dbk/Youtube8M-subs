00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.399 
jump out the pieces here you can see um
we<00:01:47.009> got<00:01:47.219> a<00:01:47.490> lot<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:47.850> these<00:01:48.180> because<00:01:48.840> those

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
we got a lot of these because those

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.289 
we got a lot of these because those
would<00:01:49.530> be<00:01:49.590> very<00:01:49.770> useful<00:01:49.890> for<00:01:50.280> by<00:01:50.549> deed<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:51.000> mock

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
would be very useful for by deed a mock

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.389 
would be very useful for by deed a mock
because<00:01:52.049> clear<00:01:52.350> pieces<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:53.009> know<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.220> can

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
because clear pieces you know you can

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.919 
because clear pieces you know you can
make<00:01:53.520> people<00:01:53.729> look<00:01:54.240> like<00:01:54.299> they're<00:01:54.570> flying

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:54.929 
make people look like they're flying

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
an airplane for my D Day mock if y'all

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.919 
an airplane for my D Day mock if y'all
showed<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.310> different<00:01:59.429> video<00:01:59.780> just<00:02:00.780> some
