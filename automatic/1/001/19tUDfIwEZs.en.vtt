if that makes sense already so just to
see<00:00:36.250> what<00:00:36.550> the<00:00:36.670> best<00:00:36.789> system<00:00:37.180> was<00:00:37.390> so<00:00:38.050> I'm<00:00:38.320> just

00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:41.469 
gonna peel off a single gem it's taking

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:45.569 
gonna peel off a single gem it's taking
the<00:00:41.559> first<00:00:41.800> one<00:00:42.010> at<00:00:42.160> the<00:00:42.219> top<00:00:42.670> of<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:45.340> the

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 
the first one at the top of the of the

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:48.930 
the first one at the top of the of the
ice<00:00:45.730> okay<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:47.710> good<00:00:48.160> thing<00:00:48.399> about<00:00:48.430> these

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
ice okay the good thing about these

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.410 
ice okay the good thing about these
being<00:00:49.269> sort<00:00:49.660> of<00:00:49.750> cheap<00:00:50.910> children's<00:00:51.910> quality

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
being sort of cheap children's quality

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.139 
being sort of cheap children's quality
is<00:00:52.660> that<00:00:52.690> they<00:00:53.350> are<00:00:53.559> not<00:00:53.710> on<00:00:53.890> there<00:00:54.160> forever

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
is that they are not on there forever

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.150 
is that they are not on there forever
and<00:00:55.660> while<00:00:56.140> sticking<00:00:56.410> them<00:00:56.649> down<00:00:56.800> you<00:00:56.980> can

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
and while sticking them down you can

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.189 
and while sticking them down you can
move<00:00:57.370> them<00:00:57.489> around<00:00:57.609> really<00:00:58.300> easily<00:00:58.449> as<00:00:59.019> well

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
move them around really easily as well

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.709 
move them around really easily as well
the<00:00:59.710> next<00:00:59.829> time<00:00:59.980> I<00:01:00.129> put<00:01:00.280> on<00:01:00.460> is<00:01:00.699> at<00:01:01.030> the<00:01:01.300> bottom

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
the next time I put on is at the bottom

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:03.180 
the next time I put on is at the bottom
and<00:01:01.870> I<00:01:01.960> try<00:01:02.170> and<00:01:02.230> get<00:01:02.410> it<00:01:02.530> in<00:01:02.649> as<00:01:02.800> much<00:01:02.980> of<00:01:03.129> a

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
and I try and get it in as much of a

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.400 
and I try and get it in as much of a
straight<00:01:03.460> line<00:01:03.640> as<00:01:03.910> possible<00:01:04.480> to<00:01:05.050> the<00:01:05.170> gem

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.410 
straight line as possible to the gem

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.880 
straight line as possible to the gem
that<00:01:05.590> I've<00:01:05.740> placed<00:01:06.190> on<00:01:06.490> the<00:01:07.240> top<00:01:07.540> and<00:01:08.020> you'll

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
that I've placed on the top and you'll

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.310 
that I've placed on the top and you'll
see<00:01:09.070> why<00:01:09.250> I<00:01:09.640> do<00:01:09.880> it<00:01:10.090> like<00:01:10.210> that<00:01:10.390> later<00:01:10.630> you<00:01:10.960> have

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
see why I do it like that later you have

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.040 
see why I do it like that later you have
cut<00:01:11.860> sort<00:01:12.520> of<00:01:12.580> the<00:01:12.670> eye<00:01:12.700> into<00:01:13.090> halves<00:01:13.510> gonna

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
cut sort of the eye into halves gonna

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.410 
cut sort of the eye into halves gonna
cut<00:01:14.380> it<00:01:14.470> into<00:01:14.620> sort<00:01:14.980> of<00:01:15.010> quarters<00:01:15.490> so<00:01:16.090> the<00:01:16.210> next

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
cut it into sort of quarters so the next

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.600 
cut it into sort of quarters so the next
chair<00:01:16.570> i<00:01:16.600> put<00:01:16.810> on<00:01:16.960> is<00:01:17.230> basically<00:01:18.160> as<00:01:18.370> i'm

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
chair i put on is basically as i'm

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.410 
chair i put on is basically as i'm
cutting<00:01:18.940> his<00:01:19.300> eye<00:01:19.480> into<00:01:19.810> quarters<00:01:20.410> so<00:01:20.710> i<00:01:21.670> press

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
cutting his eye into quarters so i press

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.170 
cutting his eye into quarters so i press
it<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:26.770> by<00:01:26.950> doing<00:01:27.010> it<00:01:27.340> like<00:01:27.490> that<00:01:27.670> these<00:01:27.880> can

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
it so by doing it like that these can

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.930 
it so by doing it like that these can
act<00:01:28.360> as<00:01:28.510> our<00:01:28.630> markers<00:01:29.140> for<00:01:29.830> how<00:01:30.070> to<00:01:30.130> evenly

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
act as our markers for how to evenly

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.600 
act as our markers for how to evenly
place<00:01:31.270> the<00:01:31.450> gems<00:01:31.690> to<00:01:32.050> get<00:01:32.230> those<00:01:32.380> looking<00:01:33.220> as

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
place the gems to get those looking as

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.600 
place the gems to get those looking as
neat<00:01:33.880> as<00:01:34.000> possible<00:01:34.140> so<00:01:35.140> where<00:01:35.800> we<00:01:35.980> over<00:01:36.280> marks

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
neat as possible so where we over marks

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.630 
neat as possible so where we over marks
are<00:01:36.730> I<00:01:36.850> already<00:01:37.300> we<00:01:37.990> then<00:01:38.200> can<00:01:38.380> just<00:01:38.650> we<00:01:39.460> know

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
are I already we then can just we know

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.820 
are I already we then can just we know
that<00:01:40.000> it<00:01:40.120> will<00:01:40.210> be<00:01:40.270> even<00:01:40.750> if<00:01:40.900> we<00:01:41.170> place<00:01:41.410> the<00:01:41.590> gem

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
that it will be even if we place the gem

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.980 
that it will be even if we place the gem
in<00:01:42.040> the<00:01:42.190> middle<00:01:42.700> of<00:01:43.030> these<00:01:43.870> two<00:01:43.930> gems<00:01:45.990> another

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
in the middle of these two gems another

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.530 
in the middle of these two gems another
one<00:01:47.170> in<00:01:47.380> the<00:01:47.500> middle<00:01:47.890> of<00:01:48.070> these<00:01:48.280> two<00:01:48.340> gems<00:01:48.820> it's

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
one in the middle of these two gems it's

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.630 
one in the middle of these two gems it's
gonna<00:01:49.630> place<00:01:49.930> one<00:01:49.960> in<00:01:50.530> the<00:01:50.680> center<00:01:51.190> for<00:01:51.490> both

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
gonna place one in the center for both

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.010 
gonna place one in the center for both
other<00:01:51.820> circles<00:01:52.330> there<00:01:52.480> because<00:01:52.810> it<00:01:52.900> would

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
other circles there because it would

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.860 
other circles there because it would
look<00:01:53.170> to<00:01:53.710> cost<00:01:54.070> it<00:01:54.250> if<00:01:54.400> I<00:01:54.520> had<00:01:54.700> one<00:01:54.970> gem<00:01:55.300> at<00:01:55.750> the

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
these a very long time maybe since I was

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.530 
these a very long time maybe since I was
12<00:02:49.920> years<00:02:50.070> old<00:02:50.310> they're<00:02:50.940> really<00:02:51.210> good<00:02:51.360> because

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
12 years old they're really good because

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.200 
12 years old they're really good because
they<00:02:51.750> come<00:02:51.990> on<00:02:52.230> a<00:02:52.440> tape<00:02:53.280> of<00:02:53.580> sort<00:02:54.120> of

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
they come on a tape of sort of

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.900 
they come on a tape of sort of
double-sided<00:02:55.140> sticky<00:02:55.590> tape<00:02:55.740> or<00:02:56.010> something<00:02:56.400> so

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
double-sided sticky tape or something so

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.010 
double-sided sticky tape or something so
you<00:02:56.970> can<00:02:57.210> see<00:02:57.270> I've<00:02:57.360> got<00:02:57.450> all<00:02:57.600> these<00:02:57.660> different

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
you can see I've got all these different

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.480 
you can see I've got all these different
shapes<00:02:58.200> here<00:02:58.500> but<00:02:58.680> I<00:02:58.710> just<00:02:58.800> use<00:02:59.100> the<00:02:59.250> circular

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
shapes here but I just use the circular

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.020 
shapes here but I just use the circular
ones<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.980> what<00:03:01.980> makes<00:03:02.490> them<00:03:02.640> so<00:03:02.760> good<00:03:02.910> is

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
ones and what makes them so good is

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.060 
ones and what makes them so good is
because<00:03:03.180> they're<00:03:03.450> kind<00:03:04.020> of<00:03:04.200> of<00:03:04.380> a<00:03:04.440> low<00:03:04.740> quality

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
because they're kind of of a low quality

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.070 
because they're kind of of a low quality
because<00:03:05.610> their<00:03:05.730> children's<00:03:06.180> product<00:03:06.600> they're

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
because their children's product they're

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.140 
because their children's product they're
very<00:03:07.290> easy<00:03:07.530> once<00:03:07.800> you've<00:03:07.950> stuck<00:03:08.250> them<00:03:08.430> on<00:03:08.550> just

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
very easy once you've stuck them on just

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.850 
very easy once you've stuck them on just
sort<00:03:09.390> of<00:03:09.420> maneuver<00:03:09.990> them<00:03:10.110> around<00:03:10.410> to<00:03:10.650> get<00:03:10.770> them

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
sort of maneuver them around to get them

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.580 
sort of maneuver them around to get them
perfectly<00:03:11.400> spaced<00:03:11.730> apart<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.510> they're<00:03:13.440> very

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
perfectly spaced apart and they're very

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.350 
perfectly spaced apart and they're very
easy<00:03:13.920> to<00:03:14.100> take<00:03:14.250> off<00:03:14.400> again<00:03:14.580> they<00:03:14.850> do<00:03:14.910> not<00:03:15.030> leave

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
easy to take off again they do not leave

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.240 
easy to take off again they do not leave
a<00:03:15.390> mark<00:03:15.780> on<00:03:16.020> your<00:03:16.170> Furby<00:03:16.590> your<00:03:16.710> Furby<00:03:17.040> like

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
a mark on your Furby your Furby like
