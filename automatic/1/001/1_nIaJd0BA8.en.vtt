are a little bit rougher than I'd like

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.470 
are a little bit rougher than I'd like
but<00:04:03.950> everything<00:04:04.790> else<00:04:04.970> feels<00:04:05.270> amazing<00:04:05.830> and

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
but everything else feels amazing and

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.120 
but everything else feels amazing and
now<00:04:08.480> a<00:04:08.510> close-up<00:04:09.170> look<00:04:09.200> of<00:04:09.620> the<00:04:09.980> twist<00:04:10.400> as<00:04:11.270> you

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
now a close-up look of the twist as you

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:19.120 
now a close-up look of the twist as you
can<00:04:13.130> see<00:04:13.340> it's<00:04:13.490> also<00:04:13.940> shiny<00:04:14.890> and<00:04:17.830> another<00:04:18.830> look

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
can see it's also shiny and another look

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:28.640 
can see it's also shiny and another look
at<00:04:19.310> the<00:04:19.459> scalp

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:44.379 

you

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:47.860 

so<00:04:44.960> the<00:04:45.289> twist<00:04:45.650> fail<00:04:46.039> amazingly<00:04:47.030> soft<00:04:47.479> much

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
so the twist fail amazingly soft much

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.499 
so the twist fail amazingly soft much
softer<00:04:48.379> than<00:04:48.560> the<00:04:48.800> loose<00:04:49.009> section<00:04:49.550> so<00:04:50.120> let<00:04:50.360> me

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:50.509 
softer than the loose section so let me

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:52.749 
softer than the loose section so let me
undo<00:04:50.990> one<00:04:51.229> the<00:04:51.530> best<00:04:51.740> way<00:04:51.979> to<00:04:52.009> describe<00:04:52.490> it

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:52.759 
undo one the best way to describe it

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:54.520 
undo one the best way to describe it
would<00:04:52.939> be<00:04:53.120> it<00:04:53.330> feels<00:04:53.599> as<00:04:53.840> if<00:04:53.870> I<00:04:54.229> moisturize

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
would be it feels as if I moisturize

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.189 
would be it feels as if I moisturize
until<00:04:55.250> the<00:04:55.460> day<00:04:55.639> before<00:04:55.819> and<00:04:56.270> this<00:04:56.810> is<00:04:56.990> it

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 
until the day before and this is it

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:22.230 
until the day before and this is it
undone<00:04:58.360> you<00:04:59.360> can<00:04:59.539> see<00:04:59.780> the<00:04:59.960> shininess

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.260 

you

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.200 

strands<00:05:27.170> are<00:05:27.380> intertwined<00:05:28.130> and<00:05:28.460> I<00:05:28.910> believe

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
strands are intertwined and I believe

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.390 
strands are intertwined and I believe
that<00:05:29.240> intertwining<00:05:30.140> helps<00:05:30.770> protect<00:05:31.190> from<00:05:31.340> the

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
that intertwining helps protect from the

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.850 
that intertwining helps protect from the
elements<00:05:32.000> as<00:05:32.150> well<00:05:32.450> as<00:05:32.510> retain<00:05:33.170> moisture<00:05:33.410> from

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
elements as well as retain moisture from

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:44.060 
elements as well as retain moisture from
the<00:05:34.070> water<00:05:34.280> rinses<00:05:34.730> as<00:05:34.940> well<00:05:35.510> as<00:05:35.690> my<00:05:35.990> sebum

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.130
