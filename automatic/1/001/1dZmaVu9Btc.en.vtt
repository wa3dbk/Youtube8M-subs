minute session but I did have a
situation<00:05:22.320> where<00:05:22.830> the<00:05:23.100> space<00:05:23.400> jams<00:05:23.810> started

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
situation where the space jams started

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.780 
situation where the space jams started
separating<00:05:25.170> on<00:05:25.680> the<00:05:25.890> sole<00:05:26.100> so<00:05:26.340> I<00:05:26.370> do<00:05:26.460> that

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:26.790 
separating on the sole so I do that

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.580 
separating on the sole so I do that
right<00:05:27.320> in<00:05:28.320> this<00:05:28.500> one<00:05:28.770> spot<00:05:30.200> to<00:05:31.200> let<00:05:31.350> cool<00:05:31.560> down

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
right in this one spot to let cool down

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.460 
right in this one spot to let cool down
