front<00:02:04.350> door<00:02:04.560> I'm<00:02:04.680> not<00:02:04.860> exactly<00:02:05.250> sure<00:02:05.460> why<00:02:05.850> he

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
front door I'm not exactly sure why he

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.940 
front door I'm not exactly sure why he
doesn't<00:02:06.360> stick<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.630> sentry<00:02:07.020> there<00:02:07.170> just<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.829> get

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
doesn't stick a sentry there just to get

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.290 
doesn't stick a sentry there just to get
a<00:02:07.979> force<00:02:08.250> field<00:02:08.520> down<00:02:08.759> in

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
a force field down in

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.720 
a force field down in
of<00:02:09.710> a<00:02:10.710> Terrence<00:02:11.340> 10<00:02:11.670> run<00:02:11.940> up<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.240> ramp<00:02:12.450> but

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
of a Terrence 10 run up the ramp but

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.830 
of a Terrence 10 run up the ramp but
guess<00:02:14.730> he's<00:02:14.910> going<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.150> do<00:02:15.300> what<00:02:15.510> he's<00:02:15.660> going

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
guess he's going to do what he's going

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.390 
guess he's going to do what he's going
to<00:02:15.900> do<00:02:16.050> you<00:02:16.260> do<00:02:16.530> not<00:02:16.680> want<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:17.010> separate<00:02:17.280> your

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
to do you do not want to separate your

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.160 
to do you do not want to separate your
ball<00:02:17.640> too<00:02:17.850> much<00:02:18.030> that<00:02:18.270> is<00:02:18.390> absolutely<00:02:18.990> true

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
ball too much that is absolutely true

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.240 
ball too much that is absolutely true
and<00:02:20.420> here<00:02:21.420> come<00:02:21.660> for<00:02:22.050> more<00:02:22.260> zealots<00:02:22.740> so<00:02:22.920> we<00:02:23.040> do

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
and here come for more zealots so we do

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.150 
and here come for more zealots so we do
have<00:02:23.490> the<00:02:23.970> charge<00:02:24.270> almost<00:02:24.840> being<00:02:25.160> completed

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
have the charge almost being completed

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.540 
have the charge almost being completed
here<00:02:26.490> expect<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.240> push<00:02:27.450> across<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.870> map<00:02:28.080> the

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
here expect to push across the map the

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.920 
here expect to push across the map the
factories<00:02:29.550> charging<00:02:30.090> across<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.540> map<00:02:30.660> and

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
factories charging across the map and

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.980 
factories charging across the map and
what<00:02:31.200> is<00:02:31.410> it<00:02:31.740> doing<00:02:32.040> I<00:02:32.430> guess<00:02:33.120> we<00:02:33.330> aren't<00:02:33.840> going

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
what is it doing I guess we aren't going

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.570 
what is it doing I guess we aren't going
to<00:02:34.080> see<00:02:34.290> we're<00:02:34.800> going<00:02:34.860> to<00:02:34.980> be<00:02:35.070> seeing<00:02:35.220> dual

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
to see we're going to be seeing dual

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.890 
to see we're going to be seeing dual
medevacs<00:02:36.120> coming<00:02:36.240> out<00:02:36.570> of<00:02:36.600> that<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:36.840> the

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
medevacs coming out of that and the

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.250 
medevacs coming out of that and the
factory<00:02:37.290> was<00:02:37.470> just<00:02:37.710> building<00:02:37.950> it<00:02:38.160> for<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:39.260> was

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
factory was just building it for I was

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.690 
factory was just building it for I was
going<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.500> say<00:02:40.650> ha<00:02:40.890> Liam's<00:02:41.130> that's<00:02:41.370> kind<00:02:41.640> of

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
going to say ha Liam's that's kind of

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.180 
going to say ha Liam's that's kind of
kind<00:02:42.090> of<00:02:42.270> strange<00:02:42.600> build<00:02:42.990> for<00:02:43.740> it<00:02:43.890> but

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
kind of strange build for it but

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.430 
kind of strange build for it but
whatever<00:02:44.730> we'll<00:02:45.150> go<00:02:45.330> with<00:02:45.480> it<00:02:48.080> Moore's<00:02:49.080> also

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
whatever we'll go with it Moore's also

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.020 
whatever we'll go with it Moore's also
we<00:02:49.530> do<00:02:49.740> have<00:02:49.920> mass<00:02:50.190> amounts<00:02:50.580> of<00:02:50.580> salts<00:02:50.910> and

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
we do have mass amounts of salts and

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.280 
we do have mass amounts of salts and
those<00:02:51.180> are<00:02:51.390> decently<00:02:51.750> get<00:02:51.990> against<00:02:52.230> the

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
those are decently get against the

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.770 
those are decently get against the
Marauders<00:02:52.740> with<00:02:53.220> stim<00:02:53.580> those<00:02:54.090> stim<00:02:54.450> my

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
Marauders with stim those stim my

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.890 
Marauders with stim those stim my
hands<00:02:55.080> still<00:02:55.530> and<00:02:55.770> those<00:02:56.310> salts<00:02:57.120> pretty<00:02:57.540> quick

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
hands still and those salts pretty quick

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.840 
hands still and those salts pretty quick
but<00:02:58.620> we<00:02:58.740> do<00:02:58.860> have<00:02:58.980> stalkers<00:02:59.280> in<00:02:59.580> the<00:02:59.670> phrase

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
but we do have stalkers in the phrase

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.520 
but we do have stalkers in the phrase
well<00:03:00.090> so<00:03:00.210> this<00:03:00.330> should<00:03:00.630> be<00:03:00.660> a<00:03:00.810> pretty<00:03:01.110> decent

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
well so this should be a pretty decent

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.500 
well so this should be a pretty decent
showdown<00:03:01.890> if<00:03:02.160> we<00:03:02.520> get<00:03:02.700> down<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:02.970> it<00:03:03.270> if<00:03:03.390> they

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
showdown if we get down to it if they

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.350 
showdown if we get down to it if they
actually<00:03:03.840> decide<00:03:04.110> to<00:03:04.290> ever<00:03:04.500> engage<00:03:05.210> scan<00:03:06.210> go

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
actually decide to ever engage scan go

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.090 
actually decide to ever engage scan go
down<00:03:06.570> he<00:03:06.720> is<00:03:06.750> going<00:03:07.020> to<00:03:07.200> see<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.440> composition

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
down he is going to see the composition

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.940 
down he is going to see the composition
of<00:03:08.220> that<00:03:08.310> Furcal<00:03:09.090> sorry<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.900> masses<00:03:10.650> elit

of that Furcal sorry the masses elit

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.720 
of that Furcal sorry the masses elit

down<00:03:14.850> that<00:03:14.880> back<00:03:15.270> door<00:03:15.570> and<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:16.650> Protoss<00:03:16.950> army

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
down that back door and the Protoss army

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.470 
down that back door and the Protoss army
is<00:03:17.250> actually<00:03:17.580> out<00:03:17.700> of<00:03:17.850> position<00:03:18.000> right<00:03:18.450> now

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
is actually out of position right now

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.490 
is actually out of position right now
which<00:03:18.870> is<00:03:18.900> not<00:03:19.260> a<00:03:19.290> good<00:03:19.530> thing<00:03:19.590> for<00:03:20.010> that<00:03:20.880> army

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
which is not a good thing for that army

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.920 
which is not a good thing for that army
