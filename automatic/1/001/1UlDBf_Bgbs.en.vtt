00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
kefir is I think interested in his work

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.410 
kefir is I think interested in his work
and<00:01:50.540> the<00:01:51.540> sense<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:51.930> decay<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.909> the<00:01:53.909> sense<00:01:54.149> of

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
and the sense of decay and the sense of

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.770 
and the sense of decay and the sense of
the<00:01:55.040> material<00:01:56.040> being<00:01:56.430> decayed<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.240> think

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
the material being decayed I think

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.429 
the material being decayed I think
Kiefer<00:01:58.320> likes<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:59.130> keep<00:01:59.490> his<00:01:59.880> works<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.960> little

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
Kiefer likes to keep his works a little

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.950 
Kiefer likes to keep his works a little

it Palme Sontag Palm Sunday that this is

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.300 
it Palme Sontag Palm Sunday that this is
a<00:02:10.170> work<00:02:10.560> that<00:02:10.860> somehow<00:02:11.330> responds<00:02:12.330> to

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
a work that somehow responds to

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.620 
a work that somehow responds to
the<00:02:13.640> East<00:02:14.270> story<00:02:14.990> in<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:15.980> Christian<00:02:16.400> story<00:02:16.940> so

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
the East story in the Christian story so

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.320 
the East story in the Christian story so
he's<00:02:18.230> searching<00:02:18.980> through<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:20.390> imagery<00:02:21.380> that

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
he's searching through the imagery that

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.840 
he's searching through the imagery that
that<00:02:23.330> story<00:02:23.660> evokes<00:02:24.020> and<00:02:24.260> obviously<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.890> way

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
that story evokes and obviously the way

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.979 
that story evokes and obviously the way
in<00:02:26.060> which<00:02:26.240> the<00:02:26.510> palm<00:02:27.110> fronds<00:02:27.740> are<00:02:28.069> placed

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
in which the palm fronds are placed

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.620 
in which the palm fronds are placed
during<00:02:29.989> Christ's<00:02:30.739> entry<00:02:31.069> into<00:02:31.670> Jerusalem<00:02:32.510> the

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
during Christ's entry into Jerusalem the

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.010 
during Christ's entry into Jerusalem the
week<00:02:32.750> before<00:02:33.080> Easter<00:02:33.110> is<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:34.880> trigger<00:02:35.360> but<00:02:35.989> I

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
week before Easter is the trigger but I

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.820 
week before Easter is the trigger but I
think<00:02:36.290> he<00:02:36.500> is<00:02:37.120> also<00:02:38.120> more<00:02:38.750> concerned<00:02:39.319> with

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
think he is also more concerned with

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.930 
think he is also more concerned with
bigger<00:02:40.400> ideas<00:02:41.120> of<00:02:42.130> spirituality<00:02:43.130> and

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
bigger ideas of spirituality and
