regrets<00:02:24.200> if<00:02:24.349> I<00:02:24.440> hadn't<00:02:24.800> gotten<00:02:25.010> this<00:02:25.250> I<00:02:25.840> would

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
regrets if I hadn't gotten this I would

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.449

have<00:02:26.900> had<00:02:27.019> serious<00:02:27.260> cigarettes<00:02:27.769> and<00:02:28.130> I<00:02:28.280> didn't

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
have had serious cigarettes and I didn't

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.009 
have had serious cigarettes and I didn't
even<00:02:28.550> know<00:02:28.760> it<00:02:29.150> was<00:02:29.209> going<00:02:29.450> to<00:02:29.540> be<00:02:29.630> this<00:02:29.780> good

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
and I he had me wearing like kind of

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
triangles on both sides at just at night

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.640 
triangles on both sides at just at night
but<00:03:46.670> now<00:03:46.880> I'm<00:03:47.060> not<00:03:47.239> wearing<00:03:47.540> anything<00:03:47.870> just

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
but now I'm not wearing anything just

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.420 
but now I'm not wearing anything just
the<00:03:49.100> braces<00:03:49.609> and<00:03:50.620> things<00:03:51.620> have<00:03:51.829> moved<00:03:52.010> it<00:03:52.220> out

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
the braces and things have moved it out

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.740 
the braces and things have moved it out
of<00:03:52.609> place<00:03:52.790> or<00:03:52.940> anything<00:03:53.239> in<00:03:53.359> fact<00:03:53.540> I<00:03:53.660> think

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
of place or anything in fact I think

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.780 
of place or anything in fact I think
they<00:03:53.959> become<00:03:54.230> tighter<00:03:54.530> and<00:03:54.709> so<00:03:55.400> they<00:03:55.579> fit

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
they become tighter and so they fit

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.410 
they become tighter and so they fit
together<00:03:55.910> even<00:03:56.389> better<00:03:56.569> now<00:03:56.810> and<00:03:58.030> so<00:03:59.030> that's

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
together even better now and so that's

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.640 
together even better now and so that's
really<00:03:59.690> good<00:04:00.049> and

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:10.100 

mmm<00:04:05.030> thing<00:04:06.030> about<00:04:06.240> oh<00:04:06.420> yeah<00:04:06.660> numbness<00:04:09.110> they're

still just like barely some like right

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.960 
still just like barely some like right
in<00:04:13.350> here<00:04:13.530> it's<00:04:14.630> like<00:04:15.860> it's<00:04:16.860> so<00:04:17.250> faint<00:04:17.670> though

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
in here it's like it's so faint though

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.130 
in here it's like it's so faint though
like<00:04:18.360> I<00:04:18.540> can<00:04:18.750> feel<00:04:19.080> this<00:04:19.410> like<00:04:19.800> I<00:04:19.980> can<00:04:20.690> feel<00:04:21.690> my

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
like I can feel this like I can feel my

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.320 
like I can feel this like I can feel my
finger<00:04:22.620> on<00:04:22.650> here<00:04:23.190> it's<00:04:23.760> just<00:04:24.000> kind<00:04:24.210> of<00:04:24.270> like

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
finger on here it's just kind of like

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.950 
finger on here it's just kind of like
tingly<00:04:25.110> and<00:04:25.410> like<00:04:26.040> not<00:04:26.430> that<00:04:27.210> to<00:04:27.540> its<00:04:27.660> full

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
tingly and like not that to its full

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.630 
tingly and like not that to its full
sensitivity<00:04:29.420> so<00:04:30.590> it<00:04:31.590> just<00:04:32.070> feels<00:04:32.370> kind<00:04:32.460> of

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
sensitivity so it just feels kind of

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.570 
sensitivity so it just feels kind of
funky<00:04:33.240> but<00:04:33.660> my<00:04:34.320> oral<00:04:34.590> surgeon<00:04:34.980> said<00:04:35.190> that<00:04:35.400> will

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
funky but my oral surgeon said that will

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.270 
funky but my oral surgeon said that will
definitely<00:04:35.820> come<00:04:36.420> back<00:04:36.630> it<00:04:37.080> just<00:04:37.530> depends<00:04:38.040> on

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
definitely come back it just depends on

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:44.360 
definitely come back it just depends on
when<00:04:38.520> like<00:04:39.300> it<00:04:39.540> could<00:04:39.660> be<00:04:40.070> you<00:04:41.070> know<00:04:43.040> but<00:04:44.040> in<00:04:44.280> a

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
when like it could be you know but in a

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.270 
when like it could be you know but in a
year<00:04:44.850> or<00:04:44.880> in<00:04:45.570> a<00:04:46.020> few<00:04:46.290> months<00:04:46.470> it<00:04:46.890> just<00:04:47.070> doesn't

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
year or in a few months it just doesn't

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.500 
year or in a few months it just doesn't
matter<00:04:47.490> but<00:04:47.790> I<00:04:47.970> mean<00:04:48.120> I'm<00:04:48.240> not<00:04:48.330> really

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
matter but I mean I'm not really

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.660 
matter but I mean I'm not really
concerned<00:04:48.750> it<00:04:49.140> doesn't<00:04:49.170> get<00:04:49.500> in<00:04:49.560> my<00:04:49.590> way<00:04:49.680> with

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
concerned it doesn't get in my way with
