00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.090
 huntelaar became perm more and more often what can still do it differently otherwise it can also 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.690
 for students with a side job a dozen events and parties and 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.559
 that is a man on the table with the city were however next to it is just think 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.559
 I always be in church 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:18.449
 in front of 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.720
 it is made in the capital nairobi ex number one state 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.960
 and it doesn't 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.839
 because dozens of cars are stolen every day 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:28.979
 this young man of 18 can change that 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:32.359
 He is the inventor of the system that controls the condition of your car 

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:34.060
 can follow the distance 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.960
 all you need is your own cell phone on which a program says 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.990
 becali to get the most votes for the god concert in the short kÃ¼r 2 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.309
 in names you are assumed that he is currently being questioned 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:46.450
 the public 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.690
 for women 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.310
 You can also put some wiring under the hood 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.930
 but it is not much 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.850
 the system is operated via SMS 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.860
 for example, you can lock your gaze from a distance 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.460
 and if you had it stolen now you don't even have to go after it 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.460
 Saving an SMS is enough to block the technician 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.970
 the funny thing is that the system can also tell you few years toos 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.510
 stayed 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.160
 who are trainer hobie almere these types of tracking systems 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.570
 only the invention of morres is a lot simpler everyone who comes this 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.940
 also 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.650
 Jeremy Denmark is that kissing the starting line they think it is right 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.040
 because of this young contain 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.910
 morris got the idea for the system that a friend of his had noticed 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.229
 if you just fry April or May a skype sjaak dentist and so on electronics 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.229
 The example of the service is that I am plugged in 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.300
 time since it received quite a bit of attention in kenya 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.660
 even the taxi driver that we impressed users today sanyo 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.420
 bikers fixed cabinets 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.850
 last year he and now 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.630
 more than a hundred people 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.570
 it is all about murder soon 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.229
 He is calm to see how now Jan Markink before the court that the 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:57.320
 campaign 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.310
 late 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.720
 can offer on the street 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.980
 Monday there was in this system meanwhile 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.320
 you buy 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.489
 it is therefore not yet clear how much the system will cost 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.269
 nevertheless it is a big parking company in kenya also interested 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.359
 and of course to be from the lancer customers 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:16.009
 what to do
