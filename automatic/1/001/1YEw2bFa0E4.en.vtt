00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
good however with that said it doesn't

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.660 
good however with that said it doesn't
really<00:04:05.810> take<00:04:06.110> great<00:04:06.470> pictures<00:04:06.680> in<00:04:07.130> low-light

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
really take great pictures in low-light

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.539 
really take great pictures in low-light

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
conditions which as you can see I took

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.650 
conditions which as you can see I took
all<00:04:13.040> of<00:04:13.100> these<00:04:13.340> pictures<00:04:13.400> outside<00:04:14.269> so<00:04:14.540> they

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
all of these pictures outside so they

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.900 
all of these pictures outside so they
look<00:04:14.870> simply<00:04:15.380> stunning<00:04:15.799> especially<00:04:16.160> on<00:04:16.640> the

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
look simply stunning especially on the

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.360 
look simply stunning especially on the
new<00:04:17.269> Retina<00:04:17.660> display<00:04:18.229> now<00:04:18.709> because<00:04:19.040> of<00:04:19.190> the

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
new Retina display now because of the

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.849 
new Retina display now because of the
upgraded<00:04:20.060> iSight<00:04:20.539> camera<00:04:20.989> it<00:04:21.289> also<00:04:21.410> allows

recording<00:04:25.360> and<00:04:25.510> as<00:04:25.750> you<00:04:25.960> can<00:04:26.140> see<00:04:26.320> in<00:04:26.530> these

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
recording and as you can see in these

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.580 
recording and as you can see in these
two<00:04:27.160> shots<00:04:27.430> here<00:04:27.670> it<00:04:28.180> does<00:04:28.570> a<00:04:28.600> really<00:04:28.720> great

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
two shots here it does a really great

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.250 
two shots here it does a really great
job<00:04:29.830> on<00:04:30.250> focusing<00:04:31.060> on<00:04:31.180> whatever<00:04:31.360> you<00:04:31.720> tap<00:04:31.990> on

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
job on focusing on whatever you tap on

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.720 
job on focusing on whatever you tap on
and<00:04:32.440> it<00:04:32.650> blurs<00:04:32.860> out<00:04:32.980> whatever<00:04:33.160> is<00:04:33.370> left<00:04:33.610> that

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
and it blurs out whatever is left that

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.820 
and it blurs out whatever is left that
you<00:04:33.820> don't<00:04:34.060> necessarily<00:04:34.240> want<00:04:34.840> in<00:04:35.290> the<00:04:35.590> shot

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
you don't necessarily want in the shot

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.160 
you don't necessarily want in the shot
itself<00:04:36.250> now<00:04:36.670> when<00:04:36.910> comparing<00:04:37.330> it<00:04:37.450> to<00:04:37.510> the<00:04:37.750> iPad

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.170 
itself now when comparing it to the iPad

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.470 
itself now when comparing it to the iPad
twos<00:04:38.500> video<00:04:38.950> recording<00:04:39.550> capabilities<00:04:39.580> it's

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
twos video recording capabilities it's

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.420 
twos video recording capabilities it's
much<00:04:40.810> more<00:04:41.020> stabilized<00:04:41.620> because<00:04:41.860> of<00:04:42.100> auto

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
much more stabilized because of auto

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.330 
much more stabilized because of auto
stabilization<00:04:43.390> and<00:04:43.570> it<00:04:44.320> doesn't<00:04:44.800> wash<00:04:45.070> out

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
stabilization and it doesn't wash out

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.460 
stabilization and it doesn't wash out
with<00:04:45.640> light<00:04:45.940> as<00:04:46.150> you<00:04:46.420> can<00:04:46.450> see<00:04:46.810> in<00:04:47.050> this<00:04:47.410> shot

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
with light as you can see in this shot

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.950 
with light as you can see in this shot
and<00:04:48.040> it<00:04:48.280> just<00:04:48.610> really<00:04:48.970> brings<00:04:49.510> out<00:04:49.720> the<00:04:49.780> color

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
and it just really brings out the color

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.200 
and it just really brings out the color
and<00:04:50.290> it<00:04:50.620> over<00:04:51.040> saturates<00:04:51.760> things<00:04:52.030> in

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
and it over saturates things in

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.840 
and it over saturates things in
comparison<00:04:52.390> to<00:04:53.020> the<00:04:53.260> iPad<00:04:53.710> twos<00:04:54.040> shots<00:04:54.460> and

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
comparison to the iPad twos shots and

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.820 
comparison to the iPad twos shots and
again<00:04:55.210> it<00:04:55.330> does<00:04:55.450> a<00:04:55.570> really<00:04:55.600> great<00:04:56.230> job<00:04:56.470> at<00:04:56.680> not

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
again it does a really great job at not

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.440 
again it does a really great job at not
letting<00:04:57.100> the<00:04:57.160> light<00:04:57.310> totally<00:04:57.820> flush<00:04:58.210> out

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
letting the light totally flush out

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.120 
letting the light totally flush out
whatever<00:04:58.780> you're<00:04:58.930> trying<00:04:59.080> to<00:04:59.260> capture<00:04:59.530> now

these<00:05:12.730> 4G<00:05:13.240> LTE<00:05:13.420> speeds<00:05:14.020> so<00:05:14.440> I<00:05:14.500> just<00:05:14.710> brought<00:05:14.920> up

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040 
these 4G LTE speeds so I just brought up

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.620 
these 4G LTE speeds so I just brought up
the<00:05:15.070> speed<00:05:15.490> test<00:05:15.760> app<00:05:16.000> here<00:05:16.240> and<00:05:16.330> we're<00:05:16.420> going

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
the speed test app here and we're going

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.190 
the speed test app here and we're going
to<00:05:16.750> test<00:05:16.960> the<00:05:17.200> speeds<00:05:17.500> of<00:05:17.680> 4G<00:05:18.400> LTE<00:05:19.080> using<00:05:20.080> the

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.200 
to test the speeds of 4G LTE using the

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.800

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
speed test app from the app store so

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.020 
speed test app from the app store so
we're<00:05:23.230> getting<00:05:23.380> some<00:05:23.500> really<00:05:24.160> great<00:05:24.550> speeds

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
we're getting some really great speeds

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.540 
we're getting some really great speeds
here<00:05:25.360> thirteen<00:05:26.170> point<00:05:26.470> three<00:05:26.590> four<00:05:27.130> megabits

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
here thirteen point three four megabits

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.670 
here thirteen point three four megabits
per<00:05:27.730> second<00:05:28.390> down<00:05:28.600> and<00:05:28.960> it<00:05:29.200> looks<00:05:29.380> like<00:05:29.530> we

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
per second down and it looks like we

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.290 
per second down and it looks like we
finished<00:05:30.040> at<00:05:30.250> five<00:05:30.580> point<00:05:31.000> four<00:05:31.240> nine

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
finished at five point four nine

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.720 
finished at five point four nine
megabits<00:05:31.930> per<00:05:32.020> second<00:05:32.620> up<00:05:32.770> now<00:05:33.280> I<00:05:33.310> know<00:05:33.460> some

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:33.730 
megabits per second up now I know some

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.640 
megabits per second up now I know some
people<00:05:33.880> get<00:05:34.150> speeds<00:05:34.510> much<00:05:34.900> faster<00:05:35.380> than<00:05:35.560> this

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
people get speeds much faster than this

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:36.930 
people get speeds much faster than this
and<00:05:35.830> other<00:05:35.920> people<00:05:36.250> get<00:05:36.400> speeds<00:05:36.610> that<00:05:36.760> are<00:05:36.880> a

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:36.940 
and other people get speeds that are a

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.490 
and other people get speeds that are a
lot<00:05:37.120> slower<00:05:37.390> than<00:05:37.540> this<00:05:37.840> but<00:05:38.080> what<00:05:38.200> you<00:05:38.230> really

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
lot slower than this but what you really

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.720 
lot slower than this but what you really
have<00:05:38.590> to<00:05:38.770> take<00:05:38.920> into<00:05:39.070> account<00:05:39.160> a<00:05:39.490> real-world

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:39.730 
have to take into account a real-world

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:41.640 
have to take into account a real-world
application<00:05:40.150> so<00:05:40.870> what<00:05:40.990> I<00:05:41.020> mean<00:05:41.230> by<00:05:41.350> that<00:05:41.380> is

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
application so what I mean by that is

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.080 
application so what I mean by that is
how<00:05:41.800> fast<00:05:42.040> it<00:05:42.220> actually<00:05:42.520> performs<00:05:42.880> when

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
how fast it actually performs when

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.090 
how fast it actually performs when
you're<00:05:43.210> trying<00:05:43.390> to<00:05:43.510> do<00:05:43.780> different<00:05:43.930> tasks<00:05:44.650> so<00:05:45.070> I

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:45.100 
you're trying to do different tasks so I

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.460 
you're trying to do different tasks so I
have<00:05:45.550> the<00:05:45.670> trailers<00:05:46.210> app<00:05:46.480> loaded<00:05:46.960> up<00:05:47.200> right

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.470 
have the trailers app loaded up right

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:48.780 
have the trailers app loaded up right
here<00:05:47.650> and<00:05:47.860> we're<00:05:47.980> gonna<00:05:48.070> go<00:05:48.280> ahead<00:05:48.310> and<00:05:48.640> just

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:48.790 
here and we're gonna go ahead and just

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.230 
here and we're gonna go ahead and just
load<00:05:49.030> some<00:05:49.330> clips<00:05:49.660> over<00:05:49.840> 4G<00:05:50.470> LTE<00:05:50.950> once<00:05:51.760> you<00:05:51.970> hit

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
load some clips over 4G LTE once you hit

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.270 
load some clips over 4G LTE once you hit
play<00:05:52.420> it<00:05:52.720> instantly<00:05:53.320> starts<00:05:53.470> playing<00:05:54.100> and

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
play it instantly starts playing and

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.340 
play it instantly starts playing and
does<00:05:54.670> a<00:05:54.850> really<00:05:55.090> great<00:05:55.300> job<00:05:55.420> at<00:05:55.810> buffering<00:05:56.200> as

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.350 
does a really great job at buffering as

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.530 
does a really great job at buffering as
you<00:05:56.530> can<00:05:56.680> see<00:05:56.890> the<00:05:57.220> light<00:05:57.490> gray<00:05:57.880> bar<00:05:58.180> there

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:58.540 
you can see the light gray bar there

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.840 
you can see the light gray bar there
shows<00:05:59.200> how<00:05:59.470> much<00:05:59.650> it's<00:05:59.830> already<00:06:00.160> buffered<00:06:00.580> so

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:00.850 
shows how much it's already buffered so

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.310 
shows how much it's already buffered so
scrubbing<00:06:01.360> ahead<00:06:01.540> to<00:06:01.690> a<00:06:01.720> part<00:06:01.960> where<00:06:02.080> it's<00:06:02.200> not

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.320 
scrubbing ahead to a part where it's not

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.830 
scrubbing ahead to a part where it's not
buffered<00:06:02.830> and<00:06:02.980> it<00:06:03.130> instantly<00:06:03.700> plays<00:06:04.240> now

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 
buffered and it instantly plays now

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.960 
buffered and it instantly plays now
let's<00:06:05.080> go<00:06:05.230> ahead<00:06:05.470> and<00:06:05.710> find<00:06:06.040> another<00:06:06.220> trailer

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:06.970 
let's go ahead and find another trailer

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.510 
let's go ahead and find another trailer
here<00:06:07.210> and<00:06:07.360> again<00:06:07.870> same<00:06:08.380> thing<00:06:08.770> happens<00:06:09.190> when

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
here and again same thing happens when

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.580 
here and again same thing happens when
you<00:06:09.640> hit<00:06:09.790> play<00:06:10.060> it<00:06:10.240> instantly<00:06:10.870> starts<00:06:11.290> playing

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:11.590 
you hit play it instantly starts playing

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.040 
you hit play it instantly starts playing
and<00:06:11.740> it<00:06:12.100> buffers<00:06:12.520> very<00:06:13.060> very<00:06:13.480> fast<00:06:13.840> and

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.050 
and it buffers very very fast and

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:15.510 
and it buffers very very fast and
there's<00:06:14.200> actually<00:06:14.530> no<00:06:14.740> wait<00:06:14.920> time<00:06:15.190> from<00:06:15.370> when

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
there's actually no wait time from when

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.130 
there's actually no wait time from when
you<00:06:15.640> open<00:06:16.120> up<00:06:16.210> the<00:06:16.390> trailer<00:06:16.630> to<00:06:16.840> when<00:06:16.990> it

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:17.140 
you open up the trailer to when it

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.380 
you open up the trailer to when it
starts<00:06:17.410> playing<00:06:17.590> now<00:06:18.250> going<00:06:18.970> to<00:06:19.120> another

works over 4G LTE for those of you that

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.010 
works over 4G LTE for those of you that
don't<00:06:49.340> know<00:06:49.460> dictation<00:06:50.060> is<00:06:50.180> basically<00:06:50.570> speech

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:51.020 
don't know dictation is basically speech

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.930 
don't know dictation is basically speech
to<00:06:51.290> text<00:06:51.500> and<00:06:51.770> it<00:06:51.950> does<00:06:52.130> work<00:06:52.280> system-wide

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:52.940 
to text and it does work system-wide

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.310 
to text and it does work system-wide
alright<00:06:53.300> so<00:06:53.420> all<00:06:53.540> you<00:06:53.630> have<00:06:53.750> to<00:06:53.780> do<00:06:53.930> is<00:06:54.050> tap<00:06:54.290> the

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:57.500 
microphone key this is a dictation test

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:01.330 
microphone key this is a dictation test
for<00:06:57.890> the<00:06:58.070> new<00:06:58.340> third-generation<00:06:59.290> iPad<00:07:00.340> all

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:01.340 
for the new third-generation iPad all

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.590 
for the new third-generation iPad all
right<00:07:01.550> then<00:07:01.700> you<00:07:01.820> just<00:07:02.030> hit<00:07:02.240> the<00:07:02.420> microphone

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:02.600 
right then you just hit the microphone

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.360 
right then you just hit the microphone
again<00:07:03.230> when<00:07:03.440> you're<00:07:03.560> finished<00:07:03.920> and<00:07:04.100> as<00:07:04.190> you

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:04.370 
again when you're finished and as you

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.700 
again when you're finished and as you
can<00:07:04.520> see<00:07:04.700> in<00:07:04.790> dictated<00:07:05.270> it<00:07:05.390> perfectly<00:07:06.170> and<00:07:06.350> it

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:06.710 
can see in dictated it perfectly and it

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.330 
can see in dictated it perfectly and it
did<00:07:06.920> work<00:07:07.070> very<00:07:07.490> fast<00:07:07.640> over<00:07:08.450> 4G<00:07:08.750> LTE<00:07:09.340> alright

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:10.340 
did work very fast over 4G LTE alright

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.150 
did work very fast over 4G LTE alright
so<00:07:10.520> here<00:07:10.760> goes<00:07:10.970> one<00:07:11.330> more<00:07:11.570> test<00:07:12.010> dictation<00:07:13.010> on

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:13.160 
so here goes one more test dictation on

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.180 
so here goes one more test dictation on
the<00:07:13.460> new<00:07:13.610> third-generation<00:07:14.330> iPad<00:07:15.200> is<00:07:15.470> amazing

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:16.190 
the new third-generation iPad is amazing

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:19.960 
the new third-generation iPad is amazing
and<00:07:17.230> again<00:07:18.230> as<00:07:18.410> you<00:07:18.680> can<00:07:18.710> see<00:07:18.890> it<00:07:19.310> did<00:07:19.580> get<00:07:19.790> that

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:19.970 
and again as you can see it did get that

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:21.040 
and again as you can see it did get that
one<00:07:20.210> correct<00:07:20.600> as<00:07:20.780> well

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:21.050 
one correct as well

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:23.680 
one correct as well
so<00:07:21.890> essentially<00:07:22.280> dictation<00:07:22.970> simply<00:07:23.450> works

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:23.690 
so essentially dictation simply works

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:26.410 
so essentially dictation simply works
and<00:07:23.930> it<00:07:24.170> does<00:07:24.350> have<00:07:24.650> its<00:07:24.830> useful<00:07:25.430> moments<00:07:25.970> so

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:26.420 
and it does have its useful moments so

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.150 
and it does have its useful moments so
to<00:07:26.480> conclude<00:07:26.900> this<00:07:27.050> has<00:07:27.200> been<00:07:27.410> my<00:07:27.620> third

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.160 
to conclude this has been my third

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.610 
to conclude this has been my third
generation<00:07:28.970> iPad<00:07:29.480> review<00:07:29.960> basically<00:07:30.440> just

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:30.620

generation iPad review basically just
going<00:07:30.920> over<00:07:31.070> the<00:07:31.220> five<00:07:31.820> key<00:07:32.210> differences

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:32.720 
going over the five key differences

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.840 
going over the five key differences
which<00:07:32.930> would<00:07:33.080> include<00:07:33.350> the<00:07:33.740> Retina<00:07:34.430> display

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:34.850 
which would include the Retina display

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:38.350 
which would include the Retina display
the<00:07:35.390> a5x<00:07:36.260> chip<00:07:36.440> the<00:07:37.190> new<00:07:37.460> upgraded<00:07:38.120> five

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:38.360 
the a5x chip the new upgraded five

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.960

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:43.060 
megapixel iSight camera 4G LTE
capabilities<00:07:41.780> and<00:07:42.200> the<00:07:42.410> addition<00:07:42.920> of

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:43.070 
capabilities and the addition of

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:45.040 
capabilities and the addition of
dictation<00:07:43.610> so<00:07:44.150> other<00:07:44.330> than<00:07:44.420> that<00:07:44.630> and<00:07:44.930> a<00:07:45.020> few

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:45.050 
dictation so other than that and a few

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:47.380 
dictation so other than that and a few
other<00:07:45.290> minor<00:07:45.620> hardware<00:07:46.550> changes<00:07:47.030> it's

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:47.390 
other minor hardware changes it's

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:48.730 
other minor hardware changes it's
basically<00:07:47.870> the<00:07:48.140> same<00:07:48.320> as<00:07:48.530> its<00:07:48.680> predecessor

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:48.740 
basically the same as its predecessor

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.460 
basically the same as its predecessor
the<00:07:49.520> iPad<00:07:50.000> 2<00:07:50.240> and<00:07:50.420> if<00:07:50.780> you<00:07:50.870> have<00:07:51.050> that<00:07:51.170> true

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:51.470 
the iPad 2 and if you have that true

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:53.080 
the iPad 2 and if you have that true
resources<00:07:51.980> it's<00:07:52.160> definitely<00:07:52.820> worth<00:07:53.060> the

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:53.090 
resources it's definitely worth the

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:55.750 
resources it's definitely worth the
upgrade<00:07:53.360> from<00:07:53.900> the<00:07:54.080> iPad<00:07:54.500> 2<00:07:54.710> in<00:07:54.950> my<00:07:55.220> opinion

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:55.760 
upgrade from the iPad 2 in my opinion

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.060 
upgrade from the iPad 2 in my opinion
because<00:07:56.270> the<00:07:56.420> Retina<00:07:56.780> display<00:07:57.140> alone<00:07:57.530> makes

00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:58.070 
because the Retina display alone makes

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:00.490 
because the Retina display alone makes
this<00:07:58.190> iPad<00:07:58.790> great<00:07:59.180> so<00:07:59.660> I<00:07:59.690> hope<00:07:59.960> you<00:08:00.080> guys<00:08:00.170> liked
