very fast I was on the left-hand side
and<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:24.030> needed<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.479> get<00:01:24.690> to<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.960> left<00:01:25.170> hand

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.889 
and I needed to get to the left hand
side<00:01:25.470> or<00:01:25.920> else<00:01:26.159> I<00:01:26.460> would<00:01:26.909> have<00:01:27.030> had<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.720> go

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
side or else I would have had to go

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:30.260 
side or else I would have had to go
through<00:01:27.929> the<00:01:28.440> whole<00:01:28.799> freaking<00:01:29.640> bridge<00:01:29.940> and

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
through the whole freaking bridge and

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.660 
through the whole freaking bridge and
then<00:01:30.659> turn<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.080> get<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.649> gamescom<00:01:32.100> which

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:54.750 

harder<00:02:51.909> to<00:02:51.939> score<00:02:52.329> some<00:02:52.540> goals<00:02:52.890> it's<00:02:53.890> much

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
harder to score some goals it's much
