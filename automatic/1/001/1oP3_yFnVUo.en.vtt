the<00:00:17.240> evolutionist<00:00:19.070> nightmare<00:00:20.070> oh<00:00:21.619> yes<00:00:22.619> the

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
the evolutionist nightmare oh yes the

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.480 
the evolutionist nightmare oh yes the
humble<00:00:23.340> banana<00:00:24.650> this<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:25.920> nightmare<00:00:26.220> for

humble banana this is a nightmare for

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.259 
humble banana this is a nightmare for
evolutionist<00:00:27.380> watch<00:00:28.550> what<00:00:29.550> shape<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.090> has

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
evolutionist watch what shape it has

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.330 
evolutionist watch what shape it has
what<00:00:31.140> showered<00:00:31.529> has<00:00:31.679> ridges<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.600> fit<00:00:33.600> as<00:00:34.340> if

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
what showered has ridges that fit as if

this is not a natural fruit this is the

this is not a natural fruit this is the

all<00:03:06.370> banana<00:03:07.060> plants<00:03:07.510> are<00:03:08.280> clones<00:03:09.280> of<00:03:09.519> each

all banana plants are clones of each

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.060 
all banana plants are clones of each
other<00:03:11.100> yes<00:03:12.100> indeed<00:03:12.459> and<00:03:13.650> they<00:03:14.650> have<00:03:14.829> to<00:03:14.950> be

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
other yes indeed and they have to be

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.280 
other yes indeed and they have to be
clones<00:03:15.310> of<00:03:15.400> each<00:03:15.519> other<00:03:15.989> because<00:03:16.989> they<00:03:17.109> don't

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
clones of each other because they don't

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.620 
clones of each other because they don't
contain<00:03:17.650> pips<00:03:17.980> a<00:03:18.570> banana<00:03:19.570> plant<00:03:20.160> can't

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
contain pips a banana plant can't

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.949 
contain pips a banana plant can't
procreate<00:03:22.630> of<00:03:22.989> its<00:03:23.680> own<00:03:23.859> accord<00:03:23.890> and<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:25.780> only

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
procreate of its own accord and the only

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.180 
procreate of its own accord and the only
reason<00:03:26.459> why<00:03:27.459> we<00:03:27.640> still<00:03:27.940> have<00:03:28.060> banana<00:03:28.359> plants

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
reason why we still have banana plants

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.460 
reason why we still have banana plants
is<00:03:30.510> because<00:03:31.920> we've<00:03:32.920> read<00:03:33.250> them<00:03:33.400> this<00:03:33.549> way<00:03:33.760> and

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
is because we've read them this way and

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.490 
is because we've read them this way and
we<00:03:35.470> are<00:03:35.590> ensuring<00:03:35.890> that<00:03:36.750> they<00:03:37.750> keep<00:03:38.019> being

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
we are ensuring that they keep being
