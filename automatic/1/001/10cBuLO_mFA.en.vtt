 which many corners and protrusions if the house 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.010
 new 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.080
 it shrinks over time 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.330

 for applying liquid wallpaper to us 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.520
 you need to prepare a wall for this with 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.700
 true delete old wallpaper 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.829
 if there are fungi on the wall 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.020
 or mold pre-pass 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.989
 antiseptic then necessary 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.989
 proshpaklevat walls and primed 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.240
 now we will prepare wallpaper we pour water 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.479
 masters advise water should not be 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.580
 cold is not hot but warm 30-35 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.190
 degrees then the glue will not stray in 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.880
 lumps if there are any in the package 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:18.060
 supplements and not getting enough sleep first 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.950
 then the rest of the contents of the material 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.840
 mix only manually not 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.270
 material mixing is allowed 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.830
 any mechanical objects so 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.290
 how can the structure be damaged 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.000
 applied plastic trowel wallpaper 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.369
 not straight but slightly at an angle 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.030
 excess material from the slopes are cut off 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.530
 knife when the wallpaper is dry 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.710
 then the trowel dipped in water and 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.899
 smooth roughness and unevenness 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.119
 I'm ready to dry you two three days and in 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.950
 unlike paper drafts they donâ€™t 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.649
 scary remnants of material are not 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.950
 dispose of them make a cake and 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.350
 save they can be useful if 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.690
 suddenly parts of the wall get dirty you don't 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.149
 have to re-stick the whole wall just 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.250
 soak and strip the damaged piece 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.830
 and as a patch, use that 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.350
 dilute the cake 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.840
 its warm water and add a little glue 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.830
 you will not believe but this drawing is made 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.600
 liquid wallpaper 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.910
 to draw the same put on 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.890
 wall sketch then distribute the material 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.020
 so that it goes a little beyond the contour and 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.270
 beat the edges of the trowel and to the contour 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.550
 If we have an internal 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.040
 contour drawing where we can not 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.920
 beat the edge of the edge of the trowel 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.200
 we use any spatula 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.090
 snow layer is applied only after 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.310
 complete drying first 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.110
 and so on, but if you do not take the time 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.040
 and show a little imagination 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.580
