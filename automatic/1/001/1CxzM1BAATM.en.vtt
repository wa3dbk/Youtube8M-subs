faster<00:00:23.550> you<00:00:23.640> can<00:00:23.730> spin<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.269> then<00:00:24.390> drop<00:00:24.689> the

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
faster you can spin it and then drop the

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.950 
faster you can spin it and then drop the
screen<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.250> print<00:00:26.460> station<00:00:26.970> better<00:00:27.660> hold

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
screen and print station better hold

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.990 
screen and print station better hold
registration<00:00:28.740> yep<00:00:29.160> fast<00:00:29.580> you<00:00:29.760> can<00:00:29.880> produce

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
with this print because I just plug the

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.080 
with this print because I just plug the
screen<00:00:57.870> out<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.350> then<00:00:58.829> push<00:00:59.070> down<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.850> I<00:00:59.969> can

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.810 

I've<00:01:07.500> been<00:01:07.680> an<00:01:07.770> advocate<00:01:07.980> of<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.400> first

I've been an advocate of the first
stirrup<00:01:09.150> for<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.420> long<00:01:09.570> time<00:01:09.900> but<00:01:10.610> some<00:01:11.610> people

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:11.910 
stirrup for a long time but some people

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.900 
stirrup for a long time but some people
like<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.390> some<00:01:12.540> people<00:01:12.960> think<00:01:13.170> it's

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:13.910 
like it and some people think it's

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.960 
like it and some people think it's
turning<00:01:14.910> aside<00:01:15.240> during<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.630> sidesaddle

turning aside during a sidesaddle
there's<00:01:17.970> our<00:01:18.120> print<00:01:18.480> and<00:01:18.720> just<00:01:19.230> load<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.010> onto

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
there's our print and just load it onto

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.820 
there's our print and just load it onto
the<00:01:20.310> belt<00:01:20.520> there<00:01:20.850> like<00:01:21.000> this<00:01:21.380> like<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:22.590> and

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
the belt there like this like this and

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.590 
the belt there like this like this and
the<00:01:22.890> belt<00:01:23.100> must<00:01:23.250> be<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.150> sticky<00:01:24.510> or

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
the belt must be is it sticky or

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.210 
the belt must be is it sticky or
something<00:01:24.870> like<00:01:24.960> that

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
something like that

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.850 
something like that
exactly<00:01:26.870> yeah<00:01:27.870> it's<00:01:27.990> got<00:01:28.140> yeah<00:01:28.170> just<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.650> little

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
exactly yeah it's got yeah just a little

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.670 
exactly yeah it's got yeah just a little
bit<00:01:28.980> of<00:01:29.070> tack<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:29.930> things<00:01:30.930> don't<00:01:31.170> blaze

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
bit of tack to it so things don't blaze

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.230 
bit of tack to it so things don't blaze
down<00:01:32.010> and<00:01:32.310> start<00:01:32.940> jamming<00:01:33.360> up<00:01:34.250> this<00:01:35.250> dryer<00:01:36.060> is

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
down and start jamming up this dryer is

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.219 
down and start jamming up this dryer is
actually<00:01:36.690> capable<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:37.400> carrying<00:01:38.720> over<00:01:39.720> 200

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
actually capable of carrying over 200

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.100 
actually capable of carrying over 200
garments<00:01:40.680> an<00:01:40.800> hour<00:01:40.950> which<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.600> really<00:01:42.600> amazing

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
garments an hour which is really amazing

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.380 
garments an hour which is really amazing
for<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.380> dryer<00:01:43.619> this<00:01:43.920> size<00:01:44.190> but<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.180> think

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
for a dryer this size but I think

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.090 
for a dryer this size but I think
overall<00:01:45.690> velvet<00:01:46.229> would<00:01:46.380> have<00:01:46.470> reacted<00:01:46.590> that's

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
overall velvet would have reacted that's

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.930 
overall velvet would have reacted that's
got<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.400> be<00:01:47.490> over<00:01:47.729> 1213<00:01:48.390> feet<00:01:48.420> yeah<00:01:49.260> just<00:01:49.530> about

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
got to be over 1213 feet yeah just about

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.780 
got to be over 1213 feet yeah just about
this<00:01:50.940> is<00:01:51.150> 6000<00:01:51.780> watt<00:01:51.900> element<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:52.790> that's

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
this is 6000 watt element so that's

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.180 
this is 6000 watt element so that's
plenty<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.150> power<00:01:54.330> the<00:01:54.810> focal<00:01:55.229> length<00:01:55.260> is<00:01:55.680> a

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
plenty of power the focal length is a

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.450 
plenty of power the focal length is a
little<00:01:56.540> lower<00:01:57.540> than<00:01:57.810> normal<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.920> has<00:01:59.130> more

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
little lower than normal so it has more

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.650 
little lower than normal so it has more
heat<00:01:59.729> in<00:02:00.540> its<00:02:00.780> space<00:02:01.080> I<00:02:02.000> designed<00:02:03.000> this<00:02:03.180> and

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
heat in its space I designed this and

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.100 
heat in its space I designed this and
I've<00:02:04.200> had<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:05.330> partnership<00:02:06.330> with<00:02:06.720> BBC

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
units for me as well as the new

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.110 
units for me as well as the new
up-and-coming<00:02:14.400> low<00:02:15.269> rider<00:02:15.540> jr.<00:02:16.050> which<00:02:16.320> is<00:02:16.560> a

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
up-and-coming low rider jr. which is a

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.000 
up-and-coming low rider jr. which is a
18<00:02:18.120> inch<00:02:18.239> belt<00:02:18.570> little<00:02:19.230> smaller<00:02:19.470> unit<00:02:19.830> a

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
18 inch belt little smaller unit a

18 inch belt little smaller unit a
little<00:02:20.130> over<00:02:20.430> 4,000<00:02:21.090> Watts<00:02:21.269> versus<00:02:21.780> 6,000<00:02:22.700> so

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
little over 4,000 Watts versus 6,000 so

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.860 
little over 4,000 Watts versus 6,000 so
if<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:23.820> don't<00:02:23.970> need<00:02:24.030> something<00:02:24.360> quite<00:02:24.570> as<00:02:24.690> big

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
if you don't need something quite as big

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.780 
if you don't need something quite as big
that<00:02:25.019> might<00:02:25.170> be<00:02:25.290> an<00:02:25.380> option<00:02:25.560> yeah<00:02:26.489> it<00:02:26.610> should

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
that might be an option yeah it should

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.530 
that might be an option yeah it should
be<00:02:26.880> out<00:02:27.030> in<00:02:27.180> about<00:02:27.239> a<00:02:27.420> month<00:02:29.120> so<00:02:30.120> this<00:02:30.209> follows

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
be out in about a month so this follows

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.210 
be out in about a month so this follows
up<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.959> belt<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.380> then<00:02:31.530> we'll<00:02:31.650> drop<00:02:31.830> into<00:02:32.190> a

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
up the belt and then we'll drop into a

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.500 
up the belt and then we'll drop into a
garment<00:02:32.519> box<00:02:32.850> or<00:02:33.000> something<00:02:33.209> like<00:02:33.269> that

yep absolutely low maintenance now if
you<00:02:37.290> have<00:02:37.440> an<00:02:37.560> existing<00:02:37.860> Ronnie<00:02:38.340> Hopkins

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
you have an existing Ronnie Hopkins

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.090 
you have an existing Ronnie Hopkins
press<00:02:39.120> or<00:02:39.390> Hopkins<00:02:39.810> press<00:02:40.050> can<00:02:40.590> you<00:02:40.769> actually

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
press or Hopkins press can you actually

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.100 
press or Hopkins press can you actually
modify<00:02:41.610> that<00:02:41.820> fresh<00:02:42.180> to<00:02:42.570> have<00:02:42.720> a<00:02:42.750> lowrider

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
modify that fresh to have a lowrider

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.940 
modify that fresh to have a lowrider
underneath<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.739> well<00:02:44.489> on<00:02:45.290> any<00:02:46.290> of<00:02:46.440> my<00:02:46.560> current

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
underneath it well on any of my current

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.990 
underneath it well on any of my current
stuff<00:02:47.250> from<00:02:47.600> 1998<00:02:48.600> to<00:02:48.630> present<00:02:49.350> yes<00:02:50.070> the

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
stuff from 1998 to present yes the

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.270 
stuff from 1998 to present yes the
previous<00:02:51.420> ones<00:02:51.690> had<00:02:52.320> a<00:02:52.350> shaft<00:02:52.709> that<00:02:53.040> stuck

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
previous ones had a shaft that stuck

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.979 
previous ones had a shaft that stuck
down<00:02:53.519> through<00:02:53.850> the<00:02:54.000> middle<00:02:54.239> of<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.510> base<00:02:54.690> so

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
down through the middle of the base so

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.570 
down through the middle of the base so
that's<00:02:55.200> a<00:02:55.320> little<00:02:55.470> different<00:02:55.920> so<00:02:56.459> it's

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
that's a little different so it's

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.100 
that's a little different so it's
basically<00:02:56.940> if<00:02:57.120> you<00:02:57.239> had<00:02:57.390> like<00:02:57.480> a<00:02:57.600> win<00:02:57.840> series

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
basically if you had like a win series

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.020 
basically if you had like a win series
press<00:02:58.410> which<00:02:58.560> has<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.830> round<00:02:59.070> base<00:02:59.340> you<00:02:59.790> just

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
press which has the round base you just

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.520 
press which has the round base you just
swap<00:03:00.269> it<00:03:00.420> and<00:03:00.480> base<00:03:00.630> out<00:03:00.870> it<00:03:01.019> might<00:03:01.200> cost<00:03:01.410> a

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
swap it and base out it might cost a

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.840 
swap it and base out it might cost a
couple<00:03:01.650> under<00:03:01.799> dollars<00:03:02.010> that's<00:03:02.400> it<00:03:02.610> yeah

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
couple under dollars that's it yeah

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.640 
couple under dollars that's it yeah

pretty Center the thing that's nice
about<00:03:04.709> this<00:03:05.160> particular<00:03:05.340> base<00:03:05.880> this<00:03:06.269> actually

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
about this particular base this actually

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.020 
about this particular base this actually
has<00:03:06.989> a<00:03:07.410> set<00:03:08.010> of<00:03:08.040> removable<00:03:08.700> legs<00:03:08.910> so

this unit is this just about spot on
where<00:03:27.770> the<00:03:27.890> bottom<00:03:28.280> of<00:03:28.370> this<00:03:28.459> base<00:03:29.030> is<00:03:29.300> so<00:03:29.900> you

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
where the bottom of this base is so you

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:31.660 
where the bottom of this base is so you
just<00:03:30.020> slide<00:03:30.470> it<00:03:30.620> out<00:03:30.709> of<00:03:30.770> the<00:03:30.890> crate<00:03:31.100> straight

just slide it out of the crate straight

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.390 
just slide it out of the crate straight
into<00:03:31.940> place<00:03:32.180> which<00:03:32.480> is<00:03:32.630> really<00:03:33.050> handy<00:03:33.400> so

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
where the casters you can move it out of

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.330 
where the casters you can move it out of
the<00:03:35.810> way<00:03:35.900> at<00:03:36.050> the<00:03:36.140> end<00:03:36.170> of<00:03:36.319> the<00:03:36.380> day<00:03:36.560> and<00:03:37.250> they

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
just the act of printing attracts people

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:52.540 
just the act of printing attracts people
because<00:03:51.320> they're<00:03:51.440> interested<00:03:51.890> to<00:03:52.010> see<00:03:52.190> what
