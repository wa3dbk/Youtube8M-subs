water really makes her here a lot more
manageable<00:01:46.129> so<00:01:47.129> I<00:01:47.160> just<00:01:47.429> start<00:01:47.759> at<00:01:47.879> the<00:01:47.970> bottom

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:48.379 
manageable so I just start at the bottom

00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:51.350 
manageable so I just start at the bottom
give<00:01:49.379> it<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.560> good<00:01:49.709> brush<00:01:50.039> our<00:01:50.310> fluffing<00:01:51.000> out<00:01:51.149> on

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
give it a good brush our fluffing out on

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.389 
give it a good brush our fluffing out on
the<00:01:51.509> end<00:01:51.780> until<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.319> can<00:01:52.619> comb<00:01:52.950> through<00:01:53.250> them

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
the end until I can comb through them

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.820 
the end until I can comb through them
easily<00:01:53.640> down<00:01:54.030> there<00:01:54.330> and<00:01:55.080> I<00:01:55.200> take<00:01:55.410> the<00:01:55.590> comb

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
easily down there and I take the comb

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.830 
easily down there and I take the comb
all<00:01:56.069> the<00:01:56.369> way<00:01:56.489> up<00:01:56.780> give<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:57.929> little<00:01:58.110> bit<00:01:58.319> more

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
all the way up give it a little bit more

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.469 
all the way up give it a little bit more
water<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.140> then<00:02:02.069> this<00:02:02.250> section<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:02.789> done<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.450> i

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
water and then this section is done so i

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.059 
water and then this section is done so i
just<00:02:03.660> wanted<00:02:03.929> to<00:02:03.959> show<00:02:04.200> that<00:02:04.379> really<00:02:04.649> quickly

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:05.069 
just wanted to show that really quickly

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:06.800 
just wanted to show that really quickly
because<00:02:05.399> that's<00:02:05.700> important<00:02:06.300> when<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.629> want

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
because that's important when you want

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.559 
because that's important when you want
to<00:02:06.869> get<00:02:07.019> a<00:02:07.050> good<00:02:07.289> rope<00:02:08.280> braid<00:02:08.700> ponytail<00:02:08.970> got

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
to get a good rope braid ponytail got

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.190 
to get a good rope braid ponytail got
everything<00:02:10.259> detangled<00:02:11.129> and<00:02:11.310> pull<00:02:12.170> to<00:02:13.170> the

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
everything detangled and pull to the

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.240 
everything detangled and pull to the
back<00:02:13.790> it<00:02:14.790> is<00:02:14.970> what<00:02:15.300> and<00:02:15.750> she's<00:02:16.530> shea<00:02:16.920> butter

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
back it is what and she's shea butter

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.800 
back it is what and she's shea butter
bar<00:02:17.489> near<00:02:17.849> earlier<00:02:18.239> so<00:02:18.450> that's<00:02:18.629> why<00:02:18.750> the

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
bar near earlier so that's why the

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.620 
bar near earlier so that's why the
column<00:02:19.200> isn't<00:02:19.379> gliding<00:02:19.950> as

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
column isn't gliding as

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.500 
column isn't gliding as
and<00:02:20.750> i<00:02:20.870> just<00:02:21.140> added<00:02:21.320> water<00:02:21.770> to<00:02:21.920> this<00:02:22.270> smooth<00:02:23.270> it

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
and i just added water to this smooth it

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.380 
and i just added water to this smooth it
as<00:02:23.660> much<00:02:23.870> as<00:02:23.900> I<00:02:24.170> can<00:02:24.410> with<00:02:24.650> my<00:02:24.680> hand<00:02:25.390> and

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
go through it like that and kind of get

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.680 
go through it like that and kind of get
all<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:30.860> air<00:02:31.070> to<00:02:31.550> lay<00:02:31.940> down<00:02:31.970> as<00:02:32.450> much<00:02:32.630> as

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
all the air to lay down as much as
