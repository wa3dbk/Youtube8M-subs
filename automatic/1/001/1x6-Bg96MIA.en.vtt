00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.819 
what else do we know about this thing
well<00:00:35.850> it's<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.570> GT<00:00:36.780> in<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.200> name<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:37.500> refers

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
well it's the GT in the name that refers

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.470

to the fact that it's a plug-in hybrid

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.799 
to the fact that it's a plug-in hybrid
so<00:00:40.020> it's<00:00:40.110> got<00:00:40.230> 245<00:00:41.129> horsepower<00:00:41.540> 500<00:00:42.540> Newton

so it's got 245 horsepower 500 Newton
meters<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.110> torque<00:00:43.170> but<00:00:43.950> we'll<00:00:44.239> officially<00:00:45.239> at

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
meters of torque but we'll officially at

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.069 
meters of torque but we'll officially at
least<00:00:45.510> consume<00:00:46.170> very<00:00:46.860> little<00:00:47.010> fuel<00:00:48.079> around

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
saw it on the Passat CC concept that was

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.760 
saw it on the Passat CC concept that was
back<00:00:53.399> in<00:00:53.430> Geneva<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.449> it's<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.320> new<00:00:55.530> wide

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
back in Geneva and it's that new wide

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.090 
back in Geneva and it's that new wide
bar<00:00:56.039> grill<00:00:56.370> with<00:00:56.610> those<00:00:57.050> smart<00:00:58.050> LED<00:00:58.469> lights

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
bar grill with those smart LED lights

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.119 
bar grill with those smart LED lights
but<00:00:59.969> as<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.210> said<00:01:00.270> yeah<00:01:00.719> this<00:01:00.960> thing<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.530> only

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
but as I said yeah this thing is only

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.740 
but as I said yeah this thing is only
for<00:01:02.550> China<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.030> that's<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.270> bit<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.539> shame<00:01:03.719> I

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
for China and that's a bit of a shame I

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.690 
for China and that's a bit of a shame I
think<00:01:04.049> it's<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.229> really<00:01:04.530> sharp<00:01:04.979> design<00:01:05.250> it's

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
think it's a really sharp design it's

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.510 
think it's a really sharp design it's
got<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.909> coupe<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.330> roofline<00:01:07.260> seems<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.369> sort

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
got the coupe a roofline seems to sort

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.310 
got the coupe a roofline seems to sort
of<00:01:08.640> tickle<00:01:09.420> those<00:01:09.570> buttons<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.920> CLS

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
of tickle those buttons that and a CLS

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.240 
of tickle those buttons that and a CLS
owner<00:01:13.320> might<00:01:14.130> perhaps<00:01:14.810> want<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.990> go<00:01:16.170> for<00:01:16.470> but

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
owner might perhaps want to go for but

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.830 
owner might perhaps want to go for but
this<00:01:17.460> thing<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:17.820> massive<00:01:18.060> I've<00:01:18.390> been<00:01:18.630> told
