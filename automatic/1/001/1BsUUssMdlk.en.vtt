so<00:04:22.810> up<00:04:23.110> to<00:04:23.470> that<00:04:23.770> speed

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:36.560 

all<00:04:30.850> right<00:04:31.150> and<00:04:31.389> right<00:04:32.169> now<00:04:33.630> let<00:04:34.630> me<00:04:34.660> see

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
all right and right now let me see

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.370 
all right and right now let me see
37<00:04:37.570> or<00:04:37.720> 36<00:04:38.910> decimal<00:04:39.910> 0<00:04:40.120> 7<00:04:40.570> megabytes<00:04:41.110> per

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
37 or 36 decimal 0 7 megabytes per

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.400 
37 or 36 decimal 0 7 megabytes per
second<00:04:42.070> and<00:04:42.310> then<00:04:42.639> upload<00:04:43.330> speed<00:04:43.690> is<00:04:43.720> 6<00:04:44.169> point

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
second and then upload speed is 6 point

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.350 
second and then upload speed is 6 point
5<00:04:44.710> 6<00:04:45.070> megabytes<00:04:45.490> per<00:04:45.669> second<00:04:46.770> so<00:04:48.360> that's

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
5 6 megabytes per second so that's

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.770 
5 6 megabytes per second so that's
pretty<00:04:49.630> good<00:04:49.870> in<00:04:49.990> my<00:04:50.139> opinion<00:04:50.320> on<00:04:51.540> Internet<00:04:52.540> is

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
pretty good in my opinion on Internet is

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.939 
pretty good in my opinion on Internet is
really<00:04:53.080> really<00:04:53.770> fast<00:04:54.150> let<00:04:55.150> me<00:04:55.240> go<00:04:55.389> to<00:04:55.949> let's

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949 
really really fast let me go to let's

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:02.760 
really really fast let me go to let's
say<00:05:00.240> overclock<00:05:01.240> net<00:05:01.690> and<00:05:01.960> then<00:05:02.169> as<00:05:02.350> soon<00:05:02.560> as<00:05:02.680> I

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
say overclock net and then as soon as I

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.600 
say overclock net and then as soon as I
hit<00:05:02.949> it<00:05:03.130> it's<00:05:03.850> already<00:05:04.240> up<00:05:04.449> which<00:05:04.900> is<00:05:05.050> nice<00:05:05.610> but

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
hit it it's already up which is nice but

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.010 
hit it it's already up which is nice but
this<00:05:06.880> router<00:05:07.180> is<00:05:07.479> definitely<00:05:08.080> a<00:05:09.600> good<00:05:10.600> router

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
this router is definitely a good router

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.350 
this router is definitely a good router

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.250 
series or something like that but this
router<00:05:23.949> I<00:05:24.460> got<00:05:24.880> was<00:05:25.330> a<00:05:25.360> little<00:05:25.630> cheaper<00:05:25.990> has<00:05:26.229> a

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.260
