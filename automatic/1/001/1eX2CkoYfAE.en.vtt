each machine named exactly the same and

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.030 
each machine named exactly the same and
figured<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:20.880> out<00:01:21.000> on<00:01:21.180> its<00:01:21.330> own<00:01:21.770> so<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:22.950> is

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
figured it out on its own so this is

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.929 
figured it out on its own so this is
going<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.189> take<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.369> minute<00:01:23.640> I'm<00:01:23.729> going<00:01:23.880> to

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
pause the video while this transfers so

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.969
