00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
HDMI port on your PlayStation 4 have a

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.839 
HDMI port on your PlayStation 4 have a
few<00:00:13.679> of<00:00:13.799> them<00:00:14.009> I'm<00:00:14.130> working<00:00:14.400> on<00:00:14.490> but<00:00:14.670> today

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
few of them I'm working on but today

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.359 
few of them I'm working on but today
we'll<00:00:15.179> be<00:00:15.330> doing<00:00:15.960> that<00:00:16.199> an<00:00:16.289> HDMI<00:00:16.770> port<00:00:16.800> on<00:00:17.190> that

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
we'll be doing that an HDMI port on that

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.910 
we'll be doing that an HDMI port on that
PlayStation<00:00:17.880> 4<00:00:20.029> as<00:00:21.029> you<00:00:21.240> can<00:00:21.390> see<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:22.230> HDMI

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
PlayStation 4 as you can see the HDMI

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.330 
PlayStation 4 as you can see the HDMI
port<00:00:22.949> is<00:00:23.660> pretty<00:00:24.660> damaged<00:00:25.170> this<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:25.980> actually

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
port is pretty damaged this is actually

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.750 
port is pretty damaged this is actually
the<00:00:26.460> number<00:00:26.789> one<00:00:26.820> cause<00:00:28.220> people<00:00:29.220> calling<00:00:29.609> in

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
the number one cause people calling in

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.260 
the number one cause people calling in
about<00:00:30.000> those<00:00:30.179> PlayStation<00:00:30.750> fours<00:00:31.850> it's<00:00:32.850> just

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
about those PlayStation fours it's just

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.350 
about those PlayStation fours it's just
a<00:00:33.420> very<00:00:34.050> fragile<00:00:34.440> component<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.820> pins<00:00:36.120> are

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
a very fragile component the pins are

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.139 
a very fragile component the pins are
very<00:00:36.570> sensitive<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.469> you<00:00:38.309> know<00:00:38.399> going<00:00:38.730> in<00:00:38.969> and

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
very sensitive and you know going in and

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.510 
very sensitive and you know going in and
out<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.600> moving<00:00:40.290> around<00:00:40.379> just<00:00:40.829> definitely

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
out and moving around just definitely

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.560 
out and moving around just definitely
makes<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.570> much<00:00:42.719> worse<00:00:43.820> so<00:00:44.820> it's<00:00:45.030> just<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.329> few

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
makes it much worse so it's just a few

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.950 
makes it much worse so it's just a few
of<00:00:45.600> them<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:46.289> pour<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:46.920> far<00:00:47.840> here's<00:00:48.840> a

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
of them that I pour so far here's a

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.369 
of them that I pour so far here's a
closer<00:00:49.260> look<00:00:49.559> at<00:00:49.969> the<00:00:50.969> motherboard<00:00:51.510> if<00:00:52.230> you

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
closer look at the motherboard if you

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.490 
closer look at the motherboard if you
don't<00:00:52.559> know<00:00:52.649> how<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.860> get<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.699> motherboard

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
don't know how to get to the motherboard

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.639 
don't know how to get to the motherboard
check<00:00:55.500> out<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.800> channel<00:00:57.079> the<00:00:58.079> other<00:00:58.260> channel

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
check out a channel the other channel

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.189 
check out a channel the other channel
that<00:00:58.680> we<00:00:58.859> have<00:00:59.210> and<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.840> has<00:01:00.960> full

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
that we have and it has full

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.450 
that we have and it has full
instructions<00:01:01.469> on<00:01:01.800> how<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.920> get<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.340> the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
instructions on how to get to the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.030 
instructions on how to get to the
motherboard<00:01:03.080> it's<00:01:04.080> really<00:01:04.290> simple<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.860> easy

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
motherboard it's really simple and easy

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.149 
motherboard it's really simple and easy
so<00:01:05.689> as<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.840> can<00:01:06.960> see<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.229> port<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.560> connected

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
so as you can see the port is connected

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.410 
so as you can see the port is connected
via<00:01:08.909> surface<00:01:09.780> mounting<00:01:10.049> solder<00:01:10.260> points<00:01:10.950> and

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
via surface mounting solder points and

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.399 
via surface mounting solder points and
it's<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.479> little<00:01:12.659> bit<00:01:12.750> tricky<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.229> make<00:01:13.380> sure

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
it's a little bit tricky so make sure

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.730 
it's a little bit tricky so make sure
you<00:01:13.590> get<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.740> easy<00:01:14.130> way<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.460> take<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.509> out<00:01:15.960> like

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
you get a easy way to take that out like

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.670 
you get a easy way to take that out like
an<00:01:16.890> alternative<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:18.140> soldering<00:01:19.140> all<00:01:19.470> those

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
an alternative to soldering all those

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.600 
an alternative to soldering all those
little<00:01:20.270> mounts<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.570> makes<00:01:22.320> soldering<00:01:23.189> very

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
little mounts that makes soldering very

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.749 
little mounts that makes soldering very
very<00:01:23.939> hard<00:01:24.740> so<00:01:25.740> we'll<00:01:25.920> cut<00:01:26.130> some<00:01:26.340> corners<00:01:26.580> a

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
very hard so we'll cut some corners a

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.999 
very hard so we'll cut some corners a
little<00:01:26.970> bit<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.420> hopefully<00:01:28.290> get<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.829> guys

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
little bit and hopefully get you guys

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.719 
little bit and hopefully get you guys
back<00:01:29.040> up<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.880> running<00:01:30.710> so<00:01:31.710> first<00:01:32.310> thing<00:01:32.700> you

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
back up and running so first thing you

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.210 
back up and running so first thing you
want<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.090> do<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.540> obtain<00:01:34.290> yourself<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.799> heat<00:01:35.009> gun

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
want to do is obtain yourself a heat gun

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.780 
want to do is obtain yourself a heat gun
or<00:01:35.280> hot<00:01:36.240> air<00:01:36.479> gun<00:01:36.750> same<00:01:37.710> difference<00:01:38.250> as<00:01:38.369> long

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
or hot air gun same difference as long

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.819 
or hot air gun same difference as long
as<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.060> gets<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.420> about<00:01:39.470> seven<00:01:40.470> hundred<00:01:40.530> and

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
as it gets to about seven hundred and

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.429 
as it gets to about seven hundred and
fifty<00:01:40.979> degrees<00:01:41.659> anything<00:01:42.659> hotter<00:01:42.960> than<00:01:43.229> that

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
fifty degrees anything hotter than that

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.380 
fifty degrees anything hotter than that
will<00:01:43.619> just<00:01:43.829> jeopardize<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.939> other<00:01:45.060> little

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
will just jeopardize the other little

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.830 
will just jeopardize the other little
components<00:01:46.020> so<00:01:47.540> obviously<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.659> want<00:01:48.810> to

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
components so obviously you want to

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.649 
components so obviously you want to
start<00:01:49.049> by<00:01:49.170> heating<00:01:49.350> up<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.619> board<00:01:50.570> loosen<00:01:51.570> up

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
start by heating up the board loosen up

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.469 
start by heating up the board loosen up
the<00:01:51.780> pin<00:01:52.020> just<00:01:53.009> two<00:01:53.280> on<00:01:53.430> each<00:01:53.610> side<00:01:53.640> plus<00:01:54.420> the

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
the pin just two on each side plus the

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.600 
the pin just two on each side plus the
solder<00:01:55.170> mounts<00:01:55.590> it's<00:01:55.920> probably<00:01:56.219> about<00:01:56.340> ten<00:01:56.579> of

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
solder mounts it's probably about ten of

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.539 
solder mounts it's probably about ten of
those<00:01:56.820> I'm<00:01:57.509> really<00:01:57.899> counting<00:01:58.369> so<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.460> just

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
those I'm really counting so you just

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.760 
those I'm really counting so you just
want<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.759> heat<00:02:00.090> up<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.360> motherboard<00:02:00.869> on<00:02:01.200> the

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
want to heat up the motherboard on the

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.660 
want to heat up the motherboard on the
backside<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:03.450> solder<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.310> at<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.490> same

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
backside of the solder and at the same

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.310 
backside of the solder and at the same
time<00:02:05.939> you<00:02:06.180> want<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.479> kind<00:02:06.659> of<00:02:06.780> grab<00:02:07.110> your

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
time you want to kind of grab your

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.680 
time you want to kind of grab your
pliers<00:02:07.560> or<00:02:07.950> some<00:02:08.099> tweezers<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:09.149> kind<00:02:09.360> of<00:02:09.420> pull

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
pliers or some tweezers to kind of pull

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.110 
pliers or some tweezers to kind of pull
on<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.959> port<00:02:10.229> as<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.739> heat<00:02:11.039> up

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
on the port as you heat up

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.410 
on the port as you heat up
the<00:02:12.750> other<00:02:13.020> side<00:02:13.280> I<00:02:14.280> didn't<00:02:14.790> have<00:02:14.910> much<00:02:15.120> help

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
the other side I didn't have much help

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.530 
the other side I didn't have much help
song<00:02:15.660> I<00:02:15.960> kind<00:02:16.350> of<00:02:16.410> made<00:02:17.190> part<00:02:17.820> one<00:02:18.000> apart<00:02:18.330> too

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
song I kind of made part one apart too

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.690 
song I kind of made part one apart too
so<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.650> first<00:02:19.830> part<00:02:20.040> is<00:02:20.160> heating<00:02:20.460> up<00:02:20.580> the

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
so the first part is heating up the

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.220 
so the first part is heating up the
board<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.210> second<00:02:21.540> part<00:02:21.720> right<00:02:21.870> here<00:02:22.080> is

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
board and the second part right here is

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.770 
board and the second part right here is
you<00:02:22.830> know<00:02:22.920> obviously<00:02:23.340> pulling<00:02:23.910> as<00:02:24.270> you<00:02:24.510> heat

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
you know obviously pulling as you heat

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.630 
you know obviously pulling as you heat
up<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:25.410> board<00:02:25.680> it's<00:02:26.010> going<00:02:26.160> to<00:02:26.220> take<00:02:26.370> a<00:02:26.400> few

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
up the board it's going to take a few

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.170 
up the board it's going to take a few
minutes<00:02:27.000> but<00:02:27.240> it<00:02:27.660> should<00:02:27.930> come<00:02:28.170> off<00:02:28.440> um<00:02:29.180> really

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
minutes but it should come off um really

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.320 
minutes but it should come off um really
simple<00:02:30.720> he's<00:02:30.900> it's<00:02:31.140> just<00:02:31.380> glide<00:02:31.680> right<00:02:31.950> out<00:02:32.330> so

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
simple he's it's just glide right out so

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.230 
simple he's it's just glide right out so
you<00:02:34.020> know<00:02:34.140> here's<00:02:34.440> that<00:02:34.620> once<00:02:35.310> you<00:02:35.459> do<00:02:35.640> remove

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
you know here's that once you do remove

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.790 
you know here's that once you do remove
it<00:02:36.450> okay<00:02:38.900> so<00:02:39.900> I<00:02:39.930> say<00:02:40.140> you<00:02:40.200> want<00:02:40.410> to<00:02:40.440> get<00:02:40.620> your

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
it okay so I say you want to get your

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.890 
it okay so I say you want to get your
Newport<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:41.520> I<00:02:42.120> would<00:02:42.330> be<00:02:42.510> talking<00:02:42.690> about

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
Newport and I would be talking about

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.160 
Newport and I would be talking about
that<00:02:43.170> later<00:02:43.410> on<00:02:43.500> in<00:02:43.740> the<00:02:43.830> video<00:02:44.810> it's<00:02:45.810> just<00:02:46.050> a

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
that later on in the video it's just a

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.970 
that later on in the video it's just a
closer<00:02:46.410> look<00:02:46.650> at<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:47.090> for<00:02:48.090> once<00:02:48.420> is<00:02:48.600> removed

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
closer look at the for once is removed

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.640 
closer look at the for once is removed
as<00:02:49.980> you<00:02:50.100> can<00:02:50.220> see<00:02:50.900> some<00:02:51.900> solder<00:02:52.140> is<00:02:52.290> still<00:02:52.470> left

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
as you can see some solder is still left

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.580 
as you can see some solder is still left
that's<00:02:53.100> what<00:02:53.250> we<00:02:53.340> need<00:02:53.550> and<00:02:53.840> you<00:02:54.840> have<00:02:54.870> some

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
that's what we need and you have some

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.050 
that's what we need and you have some
solder<00:02:55.800> on<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.100> surface<00:02:56.430> mount<00:02:56.580> that<00:02:56.850> you'll

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
solder on the surface mount that you'll

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.830 
solder on the surface mount that you'll
be<00:02:57.209> able<00:02:57.270> to<00:02:57.480> attach<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.720> new<00:02:58.050> one<00:02:58.200> to<00:02:58.410> as<00:02:58.560> well

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
be able to attach the new one to as well

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.090 
be able to attach the new one to as well
so<00:03:00.840> it's<00:03:00.959> pretty<00:03:01.080> much<00:03:01.170> you<00:03:01.650> know<00:03:01.739> obviously

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
so it's pretty much you know obviously

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.720 
so it's pretty much you know obviously
once<00:03:02.430> you<00:03:02.550> get<00:03:03.110> the<00:03:04.110> new<00:03:04.140> port<00:03:04.650> you<00:03:05.459> want<00:03:05.580> to

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
once you get the new port you want to

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.210 
once you get the new port you want to
just<00:03:05.910> reverse<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.330> procedure<00:03:06.800> and<00:03:07.800> here<00:03:08.070> it's

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
just reverse the procedure and here it's

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.830 
just reverse the procedure and here it's
just<00:03:08.310> me<00:03:09.560> you<00:03:10.560> know<00:03:10.590> just<00:03:10.860> lining<00:03:11.489> up<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:12.450> port

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
just me you know just lining up the port

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.650 
just me you know just lining up the port
the<00:03:13.170> actual<00:03:13.470> pins<00:03:13.770> on<00:03:14.160> each<00:03:14.880> side<00:03:15.180> so<00:03:15.480> you<00:03:15.570> have

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
the actual pins on each side so you have

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.890 
the actual pins on each side so you have
the<00:03:15.900> two<00:03:16.500> pins<00:03:16.709> on<00:03:17.459> each<00:03:18.239> side<00:03:18.510> and<00:03:18.690> then<00:03:18.810> you

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
the two pins on each side and then you

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.030 
the two pins on each side and then you
have<00:03:19.019> the<00:03:19.110> surface<00:03:19.380> muscle<00:03:19.680> once<00:03:19.799> you<00:03:19.890> on

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
have the surface muscle once you on

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.210 
have the surface muscle once you on
those<00:03:20.280> up<00:03:20.549> it<00:03:21.150> should<00:03:21.540> uh<00:03:21.570> should<00:03:22.110> be<00:03:22.860> good<00:03:23.100> to

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
those up it should uh should be good to

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.509 
those up it should uh should be good to
go<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:23.610> here<00:03:24.239> is<00:03:24.390> a<00:03:24.660> lot<00:03:25.140> of<00:03:25.260> demonstration<00:03:25.920> of

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.560 

of<00:03:29.519> me<00:03:30.000> heating<00:03:30.720> that<00:03:31.640> HDMI<00:03:32.640> port<00:03:33.000> back<00:03:33.209> onto

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
of me heating that HDMI port back onto

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:43.630 
of me heating that HDMI port back onto
the<00:03:33.840> board<00:03:41.269> let<00:03:42.269> you<00:03:42.450> guys<00:03:42.690> just<00:03:42.930> watch<00:03:43.140> this

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
the board let you guys just watch this

00:03:43.640 --> 00:04:07.460 
the board let you guys just watch this
this<00:03:44.640> is<00:03:44.700> live<00:03:45.060> so<00:03:45.360> I<00:03:45.720> take<00:03:46.079> a<00:03:46.110> minute<00:03:46.350> or<00:03:46.590> so

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.750 

be<00:04:08.470> patient<00:04:08.920> take<00:04:09.190> your<00:04:09.370> time<00:04:09.550> and<00:04:09.970> go<00:04:10.540> just<00:04:10.810> uh

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
be patient take your time and go just uh

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.410 
be patient take your time and go just uh
just<00:04:12.760> kind<00:04:12.940> of<00:04:13.000> slide<00:04:13.330> right<00:04:13.600> on<00:04:13.750> them<00:04:13.960> and

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:18.420 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.650 

then<00:04:19.590> once<00:04:20.590> you<00:04:20.920> do<00:04:21.190> get<00:04:21.520> in<00:04:21.640> anyone<00:04:22.120> turn<00:04:22.390> off

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
then once you do get in anyone turn off

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.620 
then once you do get in anyone turn off
the<00:04:22.900> heat<00:04:23.110> gun<00:04:23.500> or<00:04:23.860> the<00:04:23.950> hot<00:04:24.130> air<00:04:24.340> gun<00:04:24.550> and<00:04:25.360> kind

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
the heat gun or the hot air gun and kind

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.320 
the heat gun or the hot air gun and kind
of<00:04:25.720> hold<00:04:26.590> the<00:04:26.890> FlyLo<00:04:27.280> the<00:04:27.400> tweezers<00:04:27.820> in<00:04:28.000> place

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
of hold the FlyLo the tweezers in place

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.130 
of hold the FlyLo the tweezers in place
so<00:04:29.140> that<00:04:29.170> it<00:04:29.620> doesn't<00:04:29.980> slide<00:04:30.160> out<00:04:31.140> solder

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
so that it doesn't slide out solder

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.500 
so that it doesn't slide out solder
cools<00:04:32.530> down<00:04:32.710> almost<00:04:33.310> instantly<00:04:34.000> so<00:04:34.060> you<00:04:34.240> just

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
cools down almost instantly so you just

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.610 
cools down almost instantly so you just
need<00:04:34.630> to<00:04:34.920> turn<00:04:35.920> it<00:04:36.040> off<00:04:36.190> and<00:04:36.520> then<00:04:36.670> just<00:04:37.620> let

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
need to turn it off and then just let

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.040 
need to turn it off and then just let
your<00:04:38.860> hand<00:04:39.550> stay<00:04:39.850> there<00:04:40.090> for<00:04:40.300> a<00:04:40.360> few<00:04:40.540> seconds

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
your hand stay there for a few seconds

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.260 
your hand stay there for a few seconds
and<00:04:41.920> then<00:04:42.310> just<00:04:42.610> let<00:04:42.850> it<00:04:42.940> go

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
and then just let it go

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.820 
and then just let it go
you<00:04:43.690> know<00:04:43.780> what<00:04:43.930> the<00:04:44.050> heat<00:04:44.200> is<00:04:44.320> off<00:04:44.500> the<00:04:44.620> solder

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
you know what the heat is off the solder

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.280 
you know what the heat is off the solder
it<00:04:45.010> will<00:04:45.130> pretty<00:04:45.460> much<00:04:45.640> start<00:04:45.910> to<00:04:46.290> get

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
it will pretty much start to get

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:52.740 
it will pretty much start to get
stronger<00:04:47.560> and<00:04:47.800> solidify<00:04:50.640> and<00:04:51.640> that's<00:04:52.570> pretty

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
stronger and solidify and that's pretty

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.100 
stronger and solidify and that's pretty
much<00:04:52.870> it<00:04:53.020> you<00:04:53.500> know<00:04:53.620> here's<00:04:53.860> a<00:04:54.570> closer<00:04:55.570> look<00:04:55.900> if

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
much it you know here's a closer look if

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.500 
much it you know here's a closer look if
I<00:04:56.260> can<00:04:56.380> get<00:04:56.500> the<00:04:56.590> thing<00:04:56.620> on<00:04:57.120> closer<00:04:58.120> look<00:04:58.360> at

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
I can get the thing on closer look at

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.070 
I can get the thing on closer look at
that<00:04:59.280> solder<00:05:00.280> points<00:05:00.580> is<00:05:00.820> pretty<00:05:01.060> much<00:05:01.180> it<00:05:01.360> bad

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
that solder points is pretty much it bad

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.140 
that solder points is pretty much it bad
camera<00:05:02.410> angle<00:05:02.560> but<00:05:02.860> you<00:05:03.430> get<00:05:03.640> the<00:05:03.760> gist<00:05:03.910> of

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
camera angle but you get the gist of

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:12.090 
camera angle but you get the gist of
things<00:05:09.450> so<00:05:10.450> obviously<00:05:10.750> you<00:05:11.200> know<00:05:11.230> once<00:05:11.860> you

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
things so obviously you know once you

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.310 
things so obviously you know once you
get<00:05:12.250> done<00:05:12.370> with<00:05:12.550> that<00:05:12.600> you<00:05:13.600> want<00:05:13.780> to<00:05:13.900> align

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
get done with that you want to align

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.740 
get done with that you want to align
them<00:05:14.500> on<00:05:14.650> the<00:05:14.740> board<00:05:15.240> the<00:05:16.240> way<00:05:16.390> you<00:05:16.450> took<00:05:16.690> it

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
them on the board the way you took it

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:22.320 
them on the board the way you took it
out<00:05:18.210> obviously<00:05:20.370> you<00:05:21.370> probably<00:05:22.060> don't<00:05:22.210> need

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
out obviously you probably don't need

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.770 
out obviously you probably don't need
this<00:05:22.600> information<00:05:23.320> but<00:05:23.920> this<00:05:24.910> is<00:05:25.090> just<00:05:25.390> to<00:05:25.630> get

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
this information but this is just to get

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.250 
this information but this is just to get
you<00:05:25.900> started<00:05:26.400> sometimes<00:05:27.400> people<00:05:27.700> leave<00:05:27.850> off

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
you started sometimes people leave off

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.930 
you started sometimes people leave off
not<00:05:29.260> what<00:05:29.980> a<00:05:30.010> disassembly<00:05:30.670> and<00:05:30.700> that

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
not what a disassembly and that

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.820 
not what a disassembly and that
frustrates<00:05:31.570> people<00:05:31.630> sometimes<00:05:32.080> so<00:05:32.200> when<00:05:32.770> you

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
frustrates people sometimes so when you

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
frustrates people sometimes so when you
put<00:05:33.010> them<00:05:33.100> on<00:05:33.220> the<00:05:33.280> board<00:05:33.400> and<00:05:33.550> make<00:05:33.610> sure

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:33.850 
put them on the board and make sure

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.080 
put them on the board and make sure
these<00:05:34.000> little<00:05:34.390> black<00:05:35.310> peg<00:05:36.310> go<00:05:36.730> through<00:05:36.940> them

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
these little black peg go through them

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.400 
these little black peg go through them
on<00:05:37.210> the<00:05:37.330> board<00:05:37.510> and<00:05:37.630> then<00:05:37.810> you<00:05:37.900> want<00:05:38.080> to<00:05:38.140> pull

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 
on the board and then you want to pull

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:46.820 
on the board and then you want to pull
out<00:05:38.560> here<00:05:39.420> wire<00:05:40.420> for<00:05:40.690> your<00:05:40.810> fan

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.350 

just<00:05:47.830> like<00:05:47.980> a<00:05:48.010> puzzle<00:05:48.630> there's<00:05:49.630> no<00:05:49.920> you<00:05:50.920> know

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
just like a puzzle there's no you know

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.120 
just like a puzzle there's no you know
way<00:05:52.360> to<00:05:52.420> put<00:05:52.720> things<00:05:52.900> on<00:05:53.170> backwards<00:05:53.860> so<00:05:54.010> the

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
way to put things on backwards so the

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.310 
way to put things on backwards so the
wrong<00:05:54.310> way<00:05:54.490> sideways<00:05:54.850> because<00:05:55.330> everything

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
wrong way sideways because everything

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.840 
wrong way sideways because everything
like<00:05:56.470> a<00:05:56.500> puzzle<00:05:56.770> has<00:05:57.010> to<00:05:57.160> go<00:05:57.280> in<00:05:57.400> the<00:05:57.520> right<00:05:57.640> way

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:57.850 
like a puzzle has to go in the right way

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:59.670 
like a puzzle has to go in the right way
so<00:05:57.880> you<00:05:58.780> know<00:05:58.810> if<00:05:58.930> you<00:05:59.020> just<00:05:59.140> pay<00:05:59.260> attention

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 
so you know if you just pay attention

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.070 
so you know if you just pay attention
take<00:05:59.800> your<00:05:59.980> time<00:06:00.130> you<00:06:00.160> have<00:06:00.610> no<00:06:01.540> problem<00:06:01.900> doing

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
take your time you have no problem doing

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:08.090 
take your time you have no problem doing
this<00:06:02.290> at<00:06:02.500> all<00:06:02.590> whatsoever

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.100

say what the Clampetts

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.910 
say what the Clampetts
University<00:06:10.960> doesn't<00:06:11.290> matter<00:06:11.530> which<00:06:11.710> way<00:06:11.860> you

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.330 
be sure to obtain a replacement port
that<00:06:55.150> is<00:06:55.210> attached<00:06:55.660> to<00:06:55.810> a<00:06:55.930> board<00:06:56.290> versus<00:06:57.280> the

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:57.340 
that is attached to a board versus the

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.610 
that is attached to a board versus the
one<00:06:57.520> that<00:06:57.700> has<00:06:57.820> been<00:06:58.000> pulled<00:06:58.360> those<00:06:59.140> surface

00:06:59.610 --> 00:06:59.620 
one that has been pulled those surface

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.470 
one that has been pulled those surface
must<00:06:59.800> have<00:07:00.010> very<00:07:00.220> sensitive<00:07:00.550> and<00:07:01.120> they<00:07:01.210> can<00:07:01.390> be

must have very sensitive and they can be

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.480 
must have very sensitive and they can be
damaged<00:07:01.900> during<00:07:01.930> shipment<00:07:02.620> so<00:07:02.770> make<00:07:03.280> sure<00:07:03.310> you

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:03.490 
damaged during shipment so make sure you

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.070 
damaged during shipment so make sure you
get<00:07:03.610> something<00:07:03.820> similar<00:07:04.150> to<00:07:04.480> the<00:07:04.600> listen<00:07:04.930> that

get something similar to the listen that

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.310 
get something similar to the listen that
you<00:07:05.200> see<00:07:05.410> here<00:07:06.330> those<00:07:07.330> pins<00:07:07.690> can<00:07:07.840> get<00:07:08.020> out<00:07:08.110> of<00:07:08.230> a

you see here those pins can get out of a
