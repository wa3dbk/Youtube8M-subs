00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
about how it looks on the inside at some

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.279 
about how it looks on the inside at some
of<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.910> different<00:00:26.910> controls<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.689> have<00:00:27.930> and

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
as you can see here this is so much

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.139 
as you can see here this is so much
where<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.840> game<00:00:31.080> sort<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.710> takes<00:00:31.949> off<00:00:32.250> but<00:00:33.120> I

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149

want to go back and look at the controls
and<00:00:36.860> give<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.040> sense<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.579> what<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:39.000> can

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149

and inside here you can change your

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.690 
and inside here you can change your
button<00:00:48.210> position<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:49.739> can<00:00:49.890> change<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.399> touch

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
button position you can change the touch

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.439 
button position you can change the touch
layout<00:00:51.300> from<00:00:51.629> adapted<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.620> classic<00:00:53.309> back<00:00:54.239> to

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
layout from adapted to classic back to

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.720 
layout from adapted to classic back to
adapted<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.260> have<00:00:55.530> mine<00:00:55.770> set<00:00:55.980> on<00:00:56.129> adapted

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
adapted and I have mine set on adapted

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.330 
adapted and I have mine set on adapted
you<00:00:57.690> can<00:00:57.870> change<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.350> touch<00:00:58.590> steering<00:00:59.129> from

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
you can change the touch steering from

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.429 
you can change the touch steering from
analog<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.989> buttons<00:01:02.180> flick<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:04.110> tried<00:01:04.409> that

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
analog to buttons flick and I tried that

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.440 
analog to buttons flick and I tried that
and<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:04.860> really<00:01:05.129> didn't<00:01:05.369> like<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.670> at<00:01:05.790> all<00:01:05.880> and

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
and I really didn't like it at all and

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.060 
and I really didn't like it at all and
so<00:01:06.780> I'm<00:01:06.900> using<00:01:07.110> analog<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.619> got<00:01:07.950> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
so I'm using analog I got the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.609 
so I'm using analog I got the
accelerometer<00:01:08.880> turned<00:01:09.150> off<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:10.080> can<00:01:10.260> invert

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
accelerometer turned off you can invert

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.620 
accelerometer turned off you can invert
the<00:01:10.830> look<00:01:11.040> if<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.400> want<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.729> controls<00:01:12.330> on<00:01:12.510> the

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
the look if you want the controls on the

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.469 
the look if you want the controls on the
opposite<00:01:13.020> side<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.409> screen<00:01:14.000> you<00:01:15.000> can<00:01:15.180> use

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
opposite side of the screen you can use

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.499 
opposite side of the screen you can use
analog<00:01:15.900> stirring<00:01:16.380> for<00:01:16.530> your<00:01:16.710> back<00:01:17.030> on<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.390> off

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
analog stirring for your back on and off

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.020 
analog stirring for your back on and off
and<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:19.080> sensitivity<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:20.009> can<00:01:20.220> set<00:01:20.549> that<00:01:20.790> to

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
and the sensitivity you can set that to

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.380 
and the sensitivity you can set that to
suit<00:01:21.330> your<00:01:21.540> needs<00:01:22.080> there<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:23.060> going<00:01:24.060> right<00:01:24.360> on

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
language so now let's go ahead and go

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.790 
language so now let's go ahead and go
back<00:02:07.950> in<00:02:08.340> here<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.670> take<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:08.940> look<00:02:09.300> at<00:02:10.050> what<00:02:10.679> it

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
looks like on the inside I've already

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.800 
looks like on the inside I've already
started<00:02:13.349> the

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
started the

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.800 
started the
game<00:02:13.959> and<00:02:14.380> got<00:02:14.620> picked<00:02:15.220> up<00:02:15.400> by<00:02:15.459> the<00:02:15.730> cops<00:02:15.849> and
