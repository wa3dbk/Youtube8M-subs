00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
production one in the shrouds are a lot

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.570

different<00:00:24.119> yeah<00:00:25.070> everything<00:00:26.070> we<00:00:26.189> built<00:00:26.369> for

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
different yeah everything we built for

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.310 
different yeah everything we built for
James<00:00:26.849> we<00:00:27.090> went<00:00:27.240> down<00:00:27.359> early<00:00:27.779> in<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.019> year<00:00:28.170> and

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
James we went down early in the year and

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.720 
James we went down early in the year and
tested<00:00:28.650> with<00:00:28.740> him<00:00:28.830> in<00:00:28.949> Florida<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.609> know

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
he really liked the bike right away and

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.290 
he really liked the bike right away and
one<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.489> things<00:00:32.640> he<00:00:32.759> said<00:00:32.940> he<00:00:33.000> wanted<00:00:33.210> to

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
one of the things he said he wanted to

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.060 
one of the things he said he wanted to
change<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.630> was<00:00:33.809> like<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:33.960> rider<00:00:34.260> comfort<00:00:34.620> feel

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
change it was like a rider comfort feel

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.490 
change it was like a rider comfort feel
and<00:00:35.430> James<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.390> lighter<00:00:36.840> guy<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.079> little<00:00:37.320> bit

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
and James a lighter guy a little bit

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.139 
and James a lighter guy a little bit
lighter<00:00:37.680> than<00:00:37.770> Davi<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.340> also<00:00:38.610> has<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.760> bit

more<00:00:41.100> off<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.370> back<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.730> bike<00:00:41.879> James

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
more off the back of the bike James

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.000 
more off the back of the bike James
where<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.510> really<00:00:42.870> far<00:00:43.079> forward<00:00:43.469> as<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:43.800> know

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
where I really far forward as you know

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.549 
where I really far forward as you know
everybody's<00:00:44.399> seen<00:00:44.690> and<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.840> tank<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.410> whole

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
everybody's seen and the tank the whole

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.049 
everybody's seen and the tank the whole
effort<00:00:46.739> with<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.010> tank<00:00:47.309> shells<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:47.969> air

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
effort with the tank shells and the air

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.180 
effort with the tank shells and the air
box<00:00:48.210> has<00:00:48.480> all<00:00:48.690> been<00:00:48.930> basically<00:00:49.559> narrowed<00:00:50.039> up

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
box has all been basically narrowed up

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.979 
box has all been basically narrowed up
for<00:00:50.489> James<00:00:50.730> so<00:00:50.940> he<00:00:51.059> can<00:00:51.180> get<00:00:51.239> further<00:00:51.480> forward

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
for James so he can get further forward

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.020 
for James so he can get further forward
on<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.170> bike<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:53.219> radiators<00:00:53.699> are<00:00:53.879> also

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
on the bike the radiators are also

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.639 
on the bike the radiators are also
narrowed<00:00:54.480> up<00:00:54.629> for<00:00:54.960> EM<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.350> brings<00:00:55.500> a

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
narrowed up for EM so it brings a

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.229 
narrowed up for EM so it brings a
frontal<00:00:56.070> by<00:00:56.160> again<00:00:56.460> it's<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.670> little<00:00:56.850> skinnier

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
frontal by again it's a little skinnier

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.540 
frontal by again it's a little skinnier
as<00:00:57.390> well<00:00:57.620> when<00:00:58.620> we<00:00:58.710> made<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.010> tank<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.430> have

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
as well when we made the tank you have

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.310 
as well when we made the tank you have
to<00:00:59.670> make<00:00:59.820> airbox<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.600> Charles<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:00.989> go<00:01:01.109> with<00:01:01.289> it

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
to make airbox and Charles to go with it

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.660 
to make airbox and Charles to go with it
so<00:01:01.500> it's<00:01:01.530> kind<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.890> combination<00:01:02.100> deal

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
so it's kind of a combination deal

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.870 
so it's kind of a combination deal
that's<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.480> advantages<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.080> having<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:05.339> NASCAR

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
that's the advantages of having a NASCAR

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.250 
that's the advantages of having a NASCAR
team<00:01:06.119> behind<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.689> can<00:01:06.930> make<00:01:07.110> those

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
team behind it you can make those

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.859 
team behind it you can make those
changes<00:01:07.640> something<00:01:08.640> else<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.270> data<00:01:09.510> the

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
changes something else that the data the

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.219 
changes something else that the data the
mapping<00:01:10.290> James<00:01:11.010> can<00:01:11.189> actually<00:01:11.549> change<00:01:11.820> the

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
mapping James can actually change the

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.140 
mapping James can actually change the
mapping<00:01:13.229> as<00:01:13.650> he's<00:01:13.860> out<00:01:14.040> there<00:01:14.189> riding<00:01:14.430> yeah

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
mapping as he's out there riding yeah

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.760 
mapping as he's out there riding yeah
we're<00:01:15.479> we're<00:01:15.840> able<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.110> pull<00:01:16.259> data<00:01:16.500> from<00:01:16.590> the

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
we're we're able to pull data from the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.980 
we're we're able to pull data from the
bike<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.280> also<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.060> mapping<00:01:18.420> switch<00:01:18.659> is

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
bike and also the mapping switch is

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.289 
bike and also the mapping switch is
basically<00:01:19.830> we<00:01:20.009> can<00:01:20.159> load<00:01:20.369> maps<00:01:20.610> into<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.180> and

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
basically we can load maps into it and

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.730 
basically we can load maps into it and
he<00:01:21.420> can<00:01:21.540> go<00:01:21.630> out<00:01:21.750> on<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.960> track<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.229> if

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
he can go out on the track and if

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.070 
he can go out on the track and if
there's<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.400> know<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:24.390> can<00:01:24.509> change<00:01:24.540> maps

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
there's you know you can change maps

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.740 
there's you know you can change maps
depending<00:01:26.070> on<00:01:26.070> what<00:01:26.220> conditions<00:01:26.759> anything

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
depending on what conditions anything

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.539 
depending on what conditions anything
like<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:27.930> so<00:01:28.350> he<00:01:28.470> can<00:01:28.619> tell<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:29.189> know<00:01:29.310> what

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
like that so he can tell you know what

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:30.980 
like that so he can tell you know what
ma'am<00:01:29.700> he<00:01:29.729> wants<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.180> use<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.600> we<00:01:30.659> can<00:01:30.810> load<00:01:30.960> it

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
ma'am he wants to use and we can load it

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.749 
ma'am he wants to use and we can load it
into<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.290> bike<00:01:31.470> for<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.740> main<00:01:31.890> something

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
into the bike for the main something

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.340 
into the bike for the main something
