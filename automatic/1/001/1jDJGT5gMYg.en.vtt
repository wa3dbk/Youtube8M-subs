see how it all compares to the brush set
up<00:03:40.420> this<00:03:41.420> is<00:03:41.599> the<00:03:41.750> venom<00:03:42.250> 3000<00:03:43.250> nickel-metal

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
up this is the venom 3000 nickel-metal

00:03:44.470 --> 00:04:22.490 
up this is the venom 3000 nickel-metal
with<00:03:45.470> the<00:03:45.590> castle<00:03:45.920> tration<00:03:46.280> brussels<00:03:49.480> 7.0

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.149

00:04:26.149 --> 00:04:26.159 
okay now we're on to the venom 4200

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:42.809 
okay now we're on to the venom 4200
nickel-metal<00:04:27.159> eight<00:04:28.030> points<00:04:28.389> 4<00:04:28.629> volt<00:04:41.819> okay

00:04:42.809 --> 00:04:42.819 
nickel-metal eight points 4 volt okay

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:46.469 
nickel-metal eight points 4 volt okay
and<00:04:43.120> finally<00:04:43.539> we<00:04:44.020> have<00:04:44.289> the<00:04:44.740> SMC<00:04:45.729> lightning

and finally we have the SMC lightning

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:53.639 
and finally we have the SMC lightning
