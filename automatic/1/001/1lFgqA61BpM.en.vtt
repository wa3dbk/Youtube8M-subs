00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 very good morning we are here in the 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.540
 hacienda of the routine the school 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.630
 I remember for the old men we come to do 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.349
 a visit of the papaya crop 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.969
 we specifically see that they are 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.139
 applying an irrigation system and we have 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.549
 here the student's 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.640
 spiritually he is a man sir 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.080
 very good student there were classmates 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.420
 good farmers there were public 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.769
 present my name would be castro and 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.539
 part of the fourth institution with the 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.609
 what agricultural technician 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.930
 today I am going to make known about 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.340
 the irrigation system 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.870
 and in bottles this system consists of 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.510
 keep the soil moist throughout 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.860
 crop cycle this system should be 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.860
 applied in that area 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.870
 The system consists of the following 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.200
 materials that are necessary for this 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:53.650
 culture would be the plastic bottle the 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.980
 box office or any club we have the 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:59.800
 piola suncho and the 4 need serves to 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:03.960
 make a small regulation in water if 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:07.860
 we want faster so we lower it 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.619
 and if we want slower we upload it 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.540
 in this way serves the buttons to 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.869
 regular if we want faster or more 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.869
 slow 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.760
 the bottle consists of a small 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:24.330
 2000 - mm 2-mm drilling 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:27.150
 diameter at the base then the pressure 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:31.140
 atmospheric makes the water fall in 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.540
 drop shape the box office with the poma 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.760
 it is a student provocation how many 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.440
 millimeters of water falls a cap the 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:43.400
 who have calculated that flow 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:48.149
 if I have technically done and fallen 5 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:51.990
 milliliters in this capital a time in 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:55.619
 2 in 2 minutes with 27 seconds since the 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.780
 form consists of three thousand milliliters and already 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.000
 it has three liters the water intake and I 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.680
 I want to know if the student 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.290
 how do you do field practices 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.240
 they must have already checked out at what time 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.190
 base yourself on this bottle because it 's 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.860
 nice your job but the ideal would be 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.040
 you already checked out at what time 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:17.459
 delay one hour said hours is good since 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.380
 that as I say I teach him partner 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.200
 I do not really like math 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.410
 but here you know well that the 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.810
 agriculture in agronomy everything is 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.420
 related to good mathematics I 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:34.260
 technically I have made a rule of three 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:37.320
 which is this I have filled the 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.160
 tapita that consists of five thousand liters of 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.250
 Water 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.590
 malabo this minus the bottle that consists 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.050
 three thousand milliliters of water would be 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:50.030
 we would make a rule of three in which 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:56.220
 it consists we have two points 27 minutes 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:58.860
 by 2 points 95 milliliters minus 5 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.930
 milliliters with less 5 milliliters would be 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.790
 thousand 359 minutes we make a small 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.569
 conversion to know 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:11.209
 in which now no delay from how many 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:14.950
 Download hours is the good bottle 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:18.170
 we have 359 minutes one hour 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:22.489
 is equivalent to 60 minute minutes with minutes 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:27.109
 it is divided thousand 359 for the divided 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:31.129
 for 60 they give us 22 hours with 6 minutes 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:33.290
 22 hours this bottle is unloaded and that 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:35.150
 natural calculus either means that 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.650
 this system if it is efficient for a 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.689
 farmer who has a crop of 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.239
 papaya now clear is more or less 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:42.739
 you and have calculated what is the cost 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.239
 per hectare for example this would be 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.819
 recommended by farmers state 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:49.220
 unit not more than one hectare 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:52.280
 the cost would be three dollars continues 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:55.909
 with 50 cents only three dollars 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.520
 more because the plastic bottle the 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:01.880
 we recycle 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:05.180
 the cost and the cotonetes that only in the 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.890
 cost of these buttons and of course already 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.480
 be only buy as soon as it is not 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.850
 in recycled bottles directly 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.770
 if it was really interesting this 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.990
 irrigation system they have invented 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.109
 you practically because according to me 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.519
 said a student that at the beginning 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.140
 they made perforations in the bottle and 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.700
 the water stopped falling then you 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.340
 they invented putting the gates not 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.620
 they hesitated more thanks to that we gave ourselves 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.760
 mind that you were able to regulate 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.560
 frost is a research work 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.320
 interesting that gentlemen have done 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.940
 students this I congratulate this is a 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.710
 institution that also dedicates 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.410
 research as a secondary student 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.270
 in many thanks and old people you 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.990
 I go to this other occasion thank you very much 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.990
 thanks students
