00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
while to do and I've seen some copies on

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.279 
while to do and I've seen some copies on
YouTube<00:00:22.699> and<00:00:23.699> they're<00:00:23.939> not<00:00:24.119> exactly<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.990> I

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
YouTube and they're not exactly it I

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.380 
YouTube and they're not exactly it I
think<00:00:25.529> I<00:00:25.680> have<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.980> best<00:00:26.130> one<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.820> i<00:00:26.970> think<00:00:27.269> i

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
think I have the best one and i think i

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.679 
think I have the best one and i think i
actually<00:00:27.539> had<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.869> first<00:00:28.080> one<00:00:28.490> I<00:00:29.570> know<00:00:30.570> I

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
actually had the first one I know I

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.639 
actually had the first one I know I
messed<00:00:30.810> around<00:00:31.109> with<00:00:31.380> like<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.679> joker<00:00:32.610> emblem

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
messed around with like a joker emblem

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.400 
messed around with like a joker emblem
Captain<00:00:34.649> America<00:00:35.219> emblem<00:00:35.960> but<00:00:36.960> then<00:00:37.110> I've<00:00:37.230> had

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
Captain America emblem but then I've had

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
Captain America emblem but then I've had
this<00:00:37.559> for<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:38.190> while<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:39.980> and<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.040> actually<00:00:41.190> think

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
this for a while so and I actually think

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.430 
this for a while so and I actually think
I<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:42.210> know<00:00:42.300> I've<00:00:42.420> seen<00:00:42.600> one<00:00:42.809> kind<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.140> like<00:00:43.260> it

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
I you know I've seen one kind of like it

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.020 
I you know I've seen one kind of like it
on<00:00:43.530> YouTube<00:00:43.739> but<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.430> think<00:00:44.640> this<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.000> first

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
on YouTube but I think this is the first

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.330 
on YouTube but I think this is the first
one<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.570> he<00:00:45.899> kind<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.230> soft<00:00:46.469> maybe<00:00:46.800> saw<00:00:47.100> mine

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
one and he kind of soft maybe saw mine

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.380 
one and he kind of soft maybe saw mine
or<00:00:47.550> something<00:00:47.820> like<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:47.969> but<00:00:48.480> um<00:00:50.360> yeah<00:00:51.360> so

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
can do another one it probably it took

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.300 
can do another one it probably it took
