never really found a reason to ever go
over<00:02:39.510> 16<00:02:39.959> runs<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:40.320> I<00:02:40.380> know<00:02:40.440> some<00:02:41.130> program<00:02:41.580> is

00:07:33.139 --> 00:07:33.149 
liberty you probably recognize the build

00:07:33.149 --> 00:07:34.579 
liberty you probably recognize the build
already<00:07:33.479> because<00:07:33.809> it's<00:07:33.839> pretty<00:07:34.349> much<00:07:34.529> the

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:34.589 
already because it's pretty much the

00:07:34.589 --> 00:07:36.609 
already because it's pretty much the
same<00:07:34.949> thing<00:07:35.189> as<00:07:35.339> we<00:07:35.489> did<00:07:35.519> in<00:07:35.639> wings<00:07:35.939> of<00:07:36.059> liberty

00:07:39.229 --> 00:07:39.239 
with a few minor adjustments but it's

00:07:39.239 --> 00:07:42.649 
with a few minor adjustments but it's
still<00:07:39.569> pretty<00:07:39.629> much<00:07:40.079> the<00:07:40.229> same<00:07:40.379> thing
