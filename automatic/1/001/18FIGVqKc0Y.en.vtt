the brushes just to make sure that they
were<00:01:42.280> okay<00:01:42.759> the<00:01:43.270> only<00:01:43.450> thing<00:01:43.720> I<00:01:43.840> had<00:01:44.050> to<00:01:44.200> do<00:01:44.380> was

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
were okay the only thing I had to do was

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.469 
were okay the only thing I had to do was
clean<00:01:45.100> off<00:01:45.340> some<00:01:45.610> of<00:01:45.640> the<00:01:45.819> oil<00:01:46.000> that's<00:01:46.240> on

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.270 
clean off some of the oil that's on
there<00:01:46.780> but<00:01:46.929> I<00:01:46.960> compared<00:01:47.530> them<00:01:47.710> to<00:01:47.770> some<00:01:48.100> of<00:01:48.130> the

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
there but I compared them to some of the

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.770 
there but I compared them to some of the
new<00:01:48.429> brushes<00:01:48.850> I<00:01:48.970> have<00:01:49.000> today<00:01:49.360> and<00:01:49.659> they're

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
new brushes I have today and they're

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.419 
new brushes I have today and they're
almost<00:01:49.960> the<00:01:50.319> same<00:01:50.350> length<00:01:50.830> and<00:01:51.039> I'd<00:01:51.190> rather

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:51.429 
almost the same length and I'd rather

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:54.389 
almost the same length and I'd rather
use<00:01:51.759> those<00:01:52.090> new<00:01:53.020> brushes<00:01:53.470> have<00:01:53.619> a<00:01:53.740> lacquer<00:01:54.039> on

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
use those new brushes have a lacquer on

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.919 
use those new brushes have a lacquer on
them<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:55.659> can<00:01:55.810> sometimes<00:01:56.909> clog<00:01:57.909> up<00:01:58.149> the<00:01:58.179> face

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
them that can sometimes clog up the face

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:02.039 
them that can sometimes clog up the face
of<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.259> commutator<00:02:00.009> so<00:02:01.000> I<00:02:01.270> would<00:02:01.600> prefer<00:02:02.020> to

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
of the commutator so I would prefer to

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.260 
of the commutator so I would prefer to
use<00:02:02.440> the<00:02:02.860> old<00:02:03.069> brushes<00:02:03.490> and<00:02:03.880> I'm<00:02:03.970> going<00:02:04.179> to

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
use the old brushes and I'm going to

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.600 
use the old brushes and I'm going to
keep<00:02:04.420> those<00:02:04.600> on<00:02:04.840> there<00:02:05.049> in<00:02:05.200> here<00:02:05.530> I<00:02:05.679> took<00:02:06.399> a

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
keep those on there in here I took a

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.809 
keep those on there in here I took a
look<00:02:06.880> at<00:02:07.030> the<00:02:07.209> the<00:02:07.810> face<00:02:08.020> of<00:02:08.229> the<00:02:08.289> commutator

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
look at the the face of the commutator

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.520 
look at the the face of the commutator
and<00:02:09.819> it<00:02:10.239> may<00:02:10.360> be<00:02:10.420> hard<00:02:10.720> to<00:02:10.780> see<00:02:10.869> I'm<00:02:11.200> trying<00:02:11.470> to

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
and it may be hard to see I'm trying to

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.369 
and it may be hard to see I'm trying to
get<00:02:11.680> it<00:02:11.770> in<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:11.980> sunlight<00:02:12.599> it's<00:02:13.599> in<00:02:13.900> very<00:02:14.110> good

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379 
get it in the sunlight it's in very good

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.100 
get it in the sunlight it's in very good
shape<00:02:14.440> what<00:02:15.430> I<00:02:15.459> did<00:02:15.790> there<00:02:16.180> was<00:02:16.540> I<00:02:16.720> used<00:02:16.959> the

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
shape what I did there was I used the

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.720 
shape what I did there was I used the
toothpick<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:17.830> go<00:02:17.980> in<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.310> clean<00:02:18.550> out<00:02:18.580> the

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
toothpick to go in and clean out the

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.690 
toothpick to go in and clean out the
slots<00:02:19.269> in<00:02:19.920> here<00:02:20.920> and<00:02:21.510> I<00:02:22.830> used<00:02:23.830> a<00:02:24.129> contact

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
slots in here and I used a contact

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.210 
slots in here and I used a contact
cleaner<00:02:25.030> on<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:25.480> face<00:02:25.720> just<00:02:26.620> to<00:02:26.739> make<00:02:26.860> sure

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
cleaner on the face just to make sure

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.070 
cleaner on the face just to make sure
that<00:02:27.400> it<00:02:27.550> wasn't<00:02:27.910> too<00:02:28.030> bad<00:02:28.239> and<00:02:28.629> I<00:02:28.690> think<00:02:28.989> I'm

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
that it wasn't too bad and I think I'm

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.210 
that it wasn't too bad and I think I'm
going<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.260> leave<00:02:29.500> it<00:02:29.650> that<00:02:29.680> way

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
going to leave it that way

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.830 
going to leave it that way
but<00:02:30.550> I<00:02:30.580> took<00:02:30.700> a<00:02:30.849> look<00:02:31.000> at<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.209> inside<00:02:31.569> of<00:02:31.780> the

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
but I took a look at the inside of the

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.360 
but I took a look at the inside of the
faceplate<00:02:32.379> just<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:32.709> make<00:02:32.860> sure<00:02:32.890> that<00:02:33.190> there

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
faceplate just to make sure that there

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.160 
faceplate just to make sure that there
wasn't<00:02:33.580> a<00:02:33.790> buildup<00:02:34.180> of<00:02:34.330> you<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.599> carbon<00:02:35.050> or

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
wasn't a buildup of you the carbon or

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.970 
wasn't a buildup of you the carbon or
oil<00:02:35.500> in<00:02:35.830> there<00:02:36.459> risen

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.960 

one<00:02:39.980> of<00:02:40.100> the<00:02:40.160> things<00:02:40.400> I<00:02:40.550> do<00:02:40.610> with<00:02:40.880> the

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
one of the things I do with the

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.090 
one of the things I do with the
LaBelle's<00:02:41.390> as<00:02:41.720> you<00:02:41.810> can<00:02:41.960> see<00:02:42.140> this<00:02:42.290> contact<00:02:42.830> up

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
LaBelle's as you can see this contact up

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.420 
LaBelle's as you can see this contact up
here<00:02:43.750> what<00:02:44.750> I<00:02:44.780> do<00:02:44.930> is<00:02:45.110> I<00:02:45.320> usually<00:02:45.770> add<00:02:45.950> three

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
here what I do is I usually add three

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.510 
here what I do is I usually add three
drops<00:02:46.850> to<00:02:47.180> that<00:02:47.500> not<00:02:48.500> more<00:02:48.710> than<00:02:48.920> that<00:02:49.100> because

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
drops to that not more than that because

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.640 
drops to that not more than that because
then<00:02:49.730> it<00:02:49.880> gets<00:02:50.060> in<00:02:50.240> on<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.540> spindle<00:02:50.930> and<00:02:51.380> what

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
then it gets in on the spindle and what

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.160 
then it gets in on the spindle and what
it<00:02:51.770> does<00:02:51.950> is<00:02:52.130> it<00:02:52.310> starts<00:02:52.700> to<00:02:52.850> spin<00:02:53.210> oil<00:02:53.480> on<00:02:53.870> to

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
it does is it starts to spin oil on to

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.210 
it does is it starts to spin oil on to
the<00:02:54.320> brushes<00:02:54.620> and<00:02:55.130> that<00:02:55.670> creates<00:02:56.000> a<00:02:56.150> mess<00:02:56.420> also

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
the brushes and that creates a mess also

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.260 
the brushes and that creates a mess also
there's<00:02:58.220> a<00:02:58.340> well<00:02:58.730> on<00:02:59.170> the<00:03:00.170> inside<00:03:01.030> down<00:03:02.030> in

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
there's a well on the inside down in

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.600 
there's a well on the inside down in
this<00:03:02.420> area<00:03:02.810> right<00:03:02.990> here<00:03:03.050> and<00:03:03.500> what<00:03:04.280> I<00:03:04.310> like<00:03:04.580> to

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
this area right here and what I like to

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.470 
this area right here and what I like to
do<00:03:04.850> is<00:03:05.000> I<00:03:05.090> like<00:03:05.330> to<00:03:05.360> tender<00:03:06.170> up<00:03:06.590> on<00:03:06.860> end<00:03:07.130> and<00:03:07.480> get

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
do is I like to tender up on end and get

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.200 
do is I like to tender up on end and get
as<00:03:08.600> close<00:03:08.810> as<00:03:08.870> I<00:03:09.230> can<00:03:09.590> to<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.040> to<00:03:10.730> the<00:03:10.850> bearing

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
as close as I can to the to the bearing

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.240 
as close as I can to the to the bearing
which<00:03:11.420> is<00:03:11.600> located<00:03:12.050> down<00:03:12.380> inside<00:03:12.800> about<00:03:13.070> the

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
which is located down inside about the

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.130 
which is located down inside about the
only<00:03:13.370> way<00:03:13.580> that<00:03:13.610> you<00:03:13.820> can<00:03:13.970> do<00:03:14.150> that<00:03:14.330> is<00:03:14.540> with<00:03:15.080> a

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
only way that you can do that is with a

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.750 
only way that you can do that is with a
needle<00:03:15.560> tip<00:03:15.770> on<00:03:15.980> the<00:03:16.100> look<00:03:16.310> you<00:03:16.640> know

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
needle tip on the look you know

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.940 
needle tip on the look you know
something<00:03:17.270> like<00:03:17.450> that<00:03:17.660> on<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:17.870> little<00:03:18.770> bells

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
something like that on the little bells

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.860 
something like that on the little bells
oiler

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.860 

here's<00:03:22.650> my<00:03:22.890> truck<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:23.670> I<00:03:24.480> used<00:03:24.690> the

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
here's my truck and I used the

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.339 
here's my truck and I used the
desoldering<00:03:25.709> braid<00:03:25.860> in<00:03:26.930> order<00:03:27.930> to<00:03:28.050> get<00:03:28.200> the

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
desoldering braid in order to get the

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:32.420 
desoldering braid in order to get the
solder<00:03:28.680> and<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:30.000> old<00:03:30.150> wire<00:03:31.130> away<00:03:32.130> from<00:03:32.340> the

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
solder and the old wire away from the

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.970 
solder and the old wire away from the
contact<00:03:33.000> that's<00:03:33.450> on<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.780> pickup<00:03:34.170> and<00:03:34.410> when<00:03:34.950> I

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
contact that's on the pickup and when I

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.920 
contact that's on the pickup and when I
put<00:03:35.250> this<00:03:35.370> thing<00:03:35.610> together<00:03:35.790> I'm<00:03:36.569> actually

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
put this thing together I'm actually

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.890 
put this thing together I'm actually
going<00:03:37.200> to<00:03:37.260> use<00:03:37.319> a<00:03:37.440> silver<00:03:37.860> solder<00:03:38.250> I<00:03:38.900> just

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
going to use a silver solder I just

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.920 
going to use a silver solder I just
think<00:03:40.080> it<00:03:40.230> holds<00:03:40.709> better<00:03:41.069> and<00:03:41.690> whatever<00:03:42.690> you

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
think it holds better and whatever you

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.780 
think it holds better and whatever you
do<00:03:43.050> please<00:03:43.349> don't<00:03:43.560> use<00:03:43.800> plumbing<00:03:44.250> solder<00:03:44.430> it's

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
do please don't use plumbing solder it's

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.089 
do please don't use plumbing solder it's
got<00:03:44.940> acid<00:03:45.390> in<00:03:45.540> there<00:03:45.720> and<00:03:45.870> it's<00:03:45.989> good<00:03:46.260> by<00:03:46.530> wire

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
got acid in there and it's good by wire

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:50.180 
got acid in there and it's good by wire
I<00:03:47.569> try<00:03:48.569> and<00:03:48.750> set<00:03:48.930> this<00:03:49.110> up<00:03:49.380> so<00:03:49.650> that<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:49.980> wheel

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
I try and set this up so that the wheel

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.460 
I try and set this up so that the wheel
is<00:03:50.220> relatively<00:03:50.970> secure<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:51.780> wire<00:03:52.080> won't

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
is relatively secure and the wire won't

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.680 
is relatively secure and the wire won't
move<00:03:52.850> when<00:03:53.850> I<00:03:53.910> make<00:03:54.360> a<00:03:54.530> solder<00:03:55.530> joint<00:03:55.709> on

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
move when I make a solder joint on

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.090 
move when I make a solder joint on
something<00:03:57.690> that's<00:03:57.930> like<00:03:58.200> this<00:03:58.230> that's<00:03:58.860> going

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
something that's like this that's going

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.830 
something that's like this that's going
to<00:03:59.190> get<00:03:59.310> a<00:03:59.340> lot<00:03:59.549> of<00:03:59.700> wear<00:03:59.940> and<00:03:59.970> tear<00:04:00.299> I<00:04:00.390> want<00:04:00.750> to

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
to get a lot of wear and tear I want to

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.270 
to get a lot of wear and tear I want to
make<00:04:00.959> sure<00:04:00.989> that<00:04:01.440> I<00:04:01.470> end<00:04:01.680> up<00:04:01.830> with<00:04:01.980> a<00:04:02.010> pretty

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
make sure that I end up with a pretty

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.170 
make sure that I end up with a pretty
shiny<00:04:03.150> solder<00:04:03.600> joint<00:04:04.549> if<00:04:05.549> it<00:04:05.730> looks<00:04:05.940> a<00:04:06.060> little

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
shiny solder joint if it looks a little

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.300 
shiny solder joint if it looks a little
gray<00:04:06.630> and<00:04:07.049> dulled<00:04:07.410> and<00:04:07.739> that<00:04:07.830> means<00:04:08.040> it's<00:04:08.220> a

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
gray and dulled and that means it's a

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.309 
gray and dulled and that means it's a
cold<00:04:08.610> solder<00:04:08.940> joint<00:04:09.330> and<00:04:09.630> over<00:04:09.840> time<00:04:10.110> they

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
cold solder joint and over time they

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.729 
cold solder joint and over time they
just<00:04:10.349> have<00:04:10.709> a<00:04:10.739> tendency<00:04:11.370> to<00:04:11.400> come<00:04:11.730> apart<00:04:12.090> so

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
just have a tendency to come apart so

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.650 
just have a tendency to come apart so
it's<00:04:13.739> actually<00:04:13.980> pretty<00:04:14.340> shiny<00:04:14.760> it's<00:04:15.420> not

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
it's actually pretty shiny it's not

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.780 
it's actually pretty shiny it's not
super<00:04:16.380> super<00:04:16.680> shiny<00:04:16.859> because<00:04:17.250> it's<00:04:17.459> still<00:04:17.639> got

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
super super shiny because it's still got

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.629 
super super shiny because it's still got
some<00:04:17.820> rosin<00:04:18.419> on<00:04:18.510> it<00:04:19.130> but<00:04:20.130> it's<00:04:20.280> in<00:04:20.400> pretty<00:04:20.430> good

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
some rosin on it but it's in pretty good

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.520 
some rosin on it but it's in pretty good
