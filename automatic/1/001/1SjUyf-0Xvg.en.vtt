 First, youtube done warmly 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:08.189
 Welcome to a little skin show 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.450

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:15.059
 has come out today wanted the 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:17.550
 second second of 2013 and new season 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.289
 Also this kids came out there is also 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.359
 another one called steel 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.760
 and guarantees there is also 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.590
 link is on the video 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.960
 we can look at it like that 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:34.700
 looks like the kku looks like this for example 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:40.290
 that w looks so dear friends 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:42.329
 this looks to be so then explodes out 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.250
 lightning and the multi I'll show you 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:51.149
 right in the fight I'll show you once 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:53.550
 still the callback as the looks like that 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.960
 looks the recall but show we 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.460
 us times when we look at the action in 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.800
 See a real battle because as the 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.210
 looks 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.770
 In any case very, very cool 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.720
 made the ascon so that's greven 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.390
 if now the something is down on the ground 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.500
 and one presses it flashes once 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.150
 short through and this is the multi 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.960
 a little thinner beam then always 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.659
 widening 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:27.180
 you can see it a bit worse and so on 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:29.579
 looks the whole then it looks like that 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.350
 whole with the one with the 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.369
 attacks car hits makes you something 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.259
 I could turn you around differently 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.650
 The bar always and shoots for 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.009
 front which of course is really cool 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.009
 looks 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:58.540
 that's just the car hits so see the 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:02:00.670
 hero out is made quite cool hope 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.590
 you have this little insight again 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.470
 So I can not do much there 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.270
 Show more than what you can do so 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.030
 they are just ahead of you 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:14.530
 side from the back from the right side 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:17.140
 a cool skin 905 i think 945 or 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.709
 so riot points costs the same as the 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.489
 new even in the chin of the likes yes 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.150
