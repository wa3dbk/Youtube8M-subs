are what we installed earlier along with
this<00:01:32.670> folder<00:01:33.210> here<00:01:33.509> now<00:01:34.439> if<00:01:34.799> we<00:01:34.979> actually<00:01:35.310> want

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
this folder here now if we actually want

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.770 
this folder here now if we actually want
to<00:01:35.610> look<00:01:35.759> at<00:01:35.850> some<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.150> other<00:01:36.299> things<00:01:36.420> you

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
to look at some of the other things you

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.600 
to look at some of the other things you
can<00:01:36.930> see<00:01:37.140> here<00:01:37.439> well<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.070> first<00:01:38.280> one<00:01:38.400> and

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
can see here well the first one and

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.280 
can see here well the first one and
perhaps<00:01:38.759> one<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.509> most<00:01:39.570> interesting<00:01:40.200> is

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
perhaps one of the most interesting is

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.080 
perhaps one of the most interesting is
the<00:01:40.470> opening<00:01:40.950> tree<00:01:41.250> which<00:01:41.430> is<00:01:41.460> made<00:01:41.729> for<00:01:41.939> these

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
the opening tree which is made for these

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.450 
the opening tree which is made for these
four<00:01:42.390> files<00:01:42.689> here<00:01:43.170> if<00:01:43.320> you're<00:01:44.040> familiar<00:01:44.189> with

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
four files here if you're familiar with

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.130 
four files here if you're familiar with
any<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.909> chest<00:01:45.149> bass<00:01:45.329> playing<00:01:45.630> programs

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
any of the chest bass playing programs

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.490 
any of the chest bass playing programs
like<00:01:46.350> Fritz<00:01:46.649> or<00:01:46.950> rybka<00:01:47.369> or<00:01:47.780> hierarch's<00:01:48.780> then

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
like Fritz or rybka or hierarch's then

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.590 
like Fritz or rybka or hierarch's then
you<00:01:49.680> might<00:01:49.950> have<00:01:50.310> an<00:01:50.399> idea<00:01:50.520> what<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.090> opening

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
you might have an idea what the opening

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.539 
you might have an idea what the opening
tree<00:01:51.840> or<00:01:51.990> indeed<00:01:52.470> an<00:01:52.619> opening<00:01:53.009> book<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.399> it's

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
tree or indeed an opening book is it's

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.690 
tree or indeed an opening book is it's
sometimes<00:01:53.939> called<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.960> about<00:01:55.430> now<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.490> can

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
sometimes called is is about now you can

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.539 
sometimes called is is about now you can
use<00:01:56.880> this<00:01:57.119> in<00:01:57.420> any<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.930> those<00:01:58.049> programs<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:59.130> it

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
use this in any of those programs and it

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.609 
use this in any of those programs and it
will<00:01:59.670> give<00:01:59.850> you<00:02:00.020> interesting<00:02:01.020> tool<00:02:01.409> for

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
will give you interesting tool for

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.139 
will give you interesting tool for
statistical<00:02:02.130> analysis<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.790> some<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.090> the

openings this doesn't get automatically

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.340 
openings this doesn't get automatically
installed<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:06.360> can<00:02:06.390> do<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:06.750> in<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.869> variety<00:02:07.079> of

like the Fitz power book as well the
process<00:02:30.390> is<00:02:30.570> exactly<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.440> same<00:02:31.680> but<00:02:31.920> some

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
process is exactly the same but some

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.830 
process is exactly the same but some
very<00:02:32.250> interesting<00:02:32.640> information<00:02:33.030> from<00:02:33.570> that

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840

well so you can manually copy it over
I'd<00:03:12.510> literally<00:03:12.900> just<00:03:13.230> do<00:03:13.440> this<00:03:13.650> w<00:03:14.520> can<00:03:14.670> select
