00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
 then 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:18.850
 hi youtube weaver today with spotlight 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:21.470
 of the new champion character of the league 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.930
 of vigo flames set 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.990
 good to inform a model of how it is 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.450
 it is to do is 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.650
 as you could say that the carry because 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.230
 it's melee as a heel 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.760
 practically the same as heel but a 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.680
 little more powerful and more tactical is not 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.350
 need more 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.460
 strategic issue you have to think more for 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.350
 use it 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.760
 so here we are more or less seeing 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.180
 the skills and now I will explain them in 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.180
 one hour 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.640
 the equipment then good more or less 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.130
 like 30 meters as such as I am 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:58.300
 saying where can they do it 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:02.290
 however kind and if there is I know what it is 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.540
 with base side and a web with a mesh not 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.430
 I know but if the zones and cigars afterwards is 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.880
 much better I 'm testing it now 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.110
 against bots so I was pretty cool 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.680
 and good while but to buy 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:17.610
 bloodthirsty we are going to teach more or less 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.610
 how are the movements 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.540
 control 1 in play to fight and 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:25.660
 win the original 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:29.070
 has no sound yet or any 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:32.300
 even when it hurts him or something 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.300
 this is control 2 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.830
 the dance that is control 3 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:48.290
 It's like a ninja because here is 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.610
 unit is a line doomed even 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.230
 are the skills set so 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.750
 Now I will explain how it is because there is no 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.640
 description of nothing and the passive I do not have 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.070
 no idea what it is because I can not 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:03.580
 find out the 9 no light or a debut 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.580
 final you are now laughing against the 4 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:16.180
 ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha good first 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.550
 that nothing I will explain more or less 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.709
 well first we demand the google 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.450
 threw a pair of blades with a 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.220
 blade are two 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.870
 these two blades you throw them all 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.690
 the anime looks for things to see on the way 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.370
 Well, it hurts them, not then we have the w 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.190
 who created a copy either close to or 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.900
 far what is left there and that 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.310
 copy do the same skills that 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.440
 let's do ourselves and to the address 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.570
 where we make them 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.090
 does this circuit is like the w of 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.010
 Katharina hurts those of us who have 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.450
 around I do not know whether to add a bus or 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.100
 something like that or if any of the 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.200
 skills have something to do with the 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.540
 passive because it is not and I have no way 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.280
 of 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.860
 to cover it 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.470
 and well more or less to see how 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.750
 as a favorite is to take the copy with the 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.690
 enemy in between throwing the two 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.730
 blades and throw it 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.069
 does much damage the 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.379
 while you have the copy take the q2 to 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.909
 the blade this is a state 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.790
 we can use the copy to go to the 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:16.879
 walls but as it is a little distance 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.989
 well more or less a little more than arrive 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:20.849
 if we are here for example we are 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.129
 seeing we can do so and while 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:25.049
 we went up we exchanged the position with 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:27.090
 the copy and then we can do skill 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.910
 of or something like that about to give a 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.959
 last touch or something like that 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.750
 it's pretty good it's personal 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:36.880
 they appear very powerful from level 1 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.830
 and it remains to be seen the last one let's see if 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.560
 find some boat here clueless 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:44.800
 we are going against the contrabass 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.800
 or 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.530
 well the last more or less like that 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.910
 theoretically what it does is create three 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.100
 copies and the three copies are 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.730
 automatically good let's see where 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.190
 I'll deal with two balls 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.740
 but how beautiful 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.340
 this makes three copies come out and makes a 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.340
 hurting egg 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.920
 and that escaped me 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.720
 people that I would put a 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.980
 macerated more than at least to 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.980
 slow down the enemy 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.470
 the combo 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.830
 in our life that we download 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:32.230
 and I hesitate for the bitch but good 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:37.500
 this is the new character set 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:40.200
 one of lime and can you 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.750
 and good I'll throw a few games 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.300
 in 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.190
 in online and if I get something done 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.840
 a good game because I will go up and asia 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.409
 I show more or less how it is used in 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.029
 children 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:53.719
 because that has been all in saladillo and 

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:53.719
 until the next video
