welcome to this third video looking at

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.510 
welcome to this third video looking at
hyper-v<00:00:02.929> version<00:00:03.929> 3<00:00:04.170> and<00:00:04.680> the<00:00:04.799> smart<00:00:05.100> paging

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
hyper-v version 3 and the smart paging

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.839 
hyper-v version 3 and the smart paging
feature<00:00:05.759> my<00:00:06.450> name<00:00:06.600> is<00:00:06.690> Paul<00:00:06.899> Gregory<00:00:07.849> in

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
feature my name is Paul Gregory in

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.299 
feature my name is Paul Gregory in
Windows<00:00:09.240> Server<00:00:09.420> 2008<00:00:10.080> r2<00:00:10.230> Microsoft<00:00:10.980> gave<00:00:11.160> us

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
Windows Server 2008 r2 Microsoft gave us

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.339 
Windows Server 2008 r2 Microsoft gave us
dynamic<00:00:11.790> memory<00:00:12.000> so<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.389> ability<00:00:12.750> for<00:00:12.780> memory

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
dynamic memory so the ability for memory

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.589 
dynamic memory so the ability for memory
to<00:00:13.440> be<00:00:13.559> allocated<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:14.280> be<00:00:14.400> allocated<00:00:15.000> from<00:00:15.450> a

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
to be allocated and be allocated from a

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.180 
to be allocated and be allocated from a
regime<00:00:15.929> while<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.440> virtual<00:00:16.770> machine<00:00:16.830> was

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
regime while the virtual machine was

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.929 
regime while the virtual machine was
running<00:00:18.529> Windows<00:00:19.529> Server<00:00:19.560> 2012<00:00:19.920> extends<00:00:20.820> this

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
running Windows Server 2012 extends this

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.599 
running Windows Server 2012 extends this
capability<00:00:21.470> so<00:00:22.470> looking<00:00:22.769> in<00:00:22.859> server<00:00:23.160> manager

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
capability so looking in server manager

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.519 
capability so looking in server manager
here<00:00:23.820> we<00:00:23.939> can<00:00:24.119> see<00:00:24.300> my<00:00:24.510> machine<00:00:24.810> has<00:00:25.019> 16

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
here we can see my machine has 16

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.220 
here we can see my machine has 16
gigabytes<00:00:26.039> of<00:00:26.250> RAM<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:27.420> if<00:00:27.539> we<00:00:27.660> just<00:00:27.840> go<00:00:27.990> into

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
gigabytes of RAM and if we just go into

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.890 
gigabytes of RAM and if we just go into
task<00:00:28.500> manager<00:00:29.039> quickly<00:00:29.460> we<00:00:30.179> can<00:00:30.359> actually<00:00:30.480> see

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
task manager quickly we can actually see

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.049 
task manager quickly we can actually see
three<00:00:31.800> point<00:00:32.070> four<00:00:32.250> gigabytes<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.880> that

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
three point four gigabytes of that

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.690 
three point four gigabytes of that
memory<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:33.390> currently<00:00:33.809> in<00:00:33.960> use<00:00:34.520> so<00:00:35.520> much<00:00:35.640> of

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
memory is currently in use so much of

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.819 
memory is currently in use so much of
that<00:00:35.880> memories<00:00:36.239> in<00:00:36.390> use<00:00:36.630> because<00:00:37.410> i<00:00:37.440> actually

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
that memories in use because i actually

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.340 
that memories in use because i actually
have<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.489> virtual<00:00:38.940> machine<00:00:39.239> running<00:00:39.270> as<00:00:40.020> part

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
have a virtual machine running as part

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.979 
have a virtual machine running as part
of<00:00:40.469> my<00:00:40.620> current<00:00:40.890> installation<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.719> if<00:00:42.780> we<00:00:42.870> go

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
of my current installation so if we go

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.529 
of my current installation so if we go
into<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.260> hyper-v<00:00:43.559> manager<00:00:44.190> we<00:00:44.940> can<00:00:45.120> see<00:00:45.329> that

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
into the hyper-v manager we can see that

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.810 
into the hyper-v manager we can see that
the<00:00:45.930> first<00:00:46.170> virtual<00:00:46.379> machine<00:00:46.770> is<00:00:46.920> running<00:00:47.100> and

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
the first virtual machine is running and

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.790 
the first virtual machine is running and
it's<00:00:47.940> actually<00:00:48.090> configured<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.899> use<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.260> static

it's actually configured to use a static

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.610 
it's actually configured to use a static
amount<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.399> memory<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.910> two<00:00:51.320> gigabytes<00:00:52.320> it's

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
amount of memory of two gigabytes it's

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.770 
amount of memory of two gigabytes it's
not<00:00:52.829> actually<00:00:53.280> using<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.180> dynamic<00:00:54.329> memory

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
not actually using the dynamic memory

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.889 
not actually using the dynamic memory
feature<00:00:55.610> if<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:56.699> go<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.120> second<00:00:57.539> virtual

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
feature if I go to the second virtual

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.540 
feature if I go to the second virtual
machine<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.739> we<00:00:58.859> actually<00:00:59.039> have<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> look<00:00:59.460> at

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
machine and we actually have a look at

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.400 
machine and we actually have a look at
it<00:00:59.609> settings<00:01:00.090> will<00:01:00.899> see<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.289> it's

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
it settings will see that it's

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.500 
it settings will see that it's
configured<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.859> use<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.039> startup<00:01:02.670> memory<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.239> 10

configured to use a startup memory of 10

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.109 
configured to use a startup memory of 10
gigabytes<00:01:04.100> but<00:01:05.100> also<00:01:05.250> dynamic<00:01:05.880> memory

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
gigabytes but also dynamic memory

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.359 
gigabytes but also dynamic memory
configured<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.590> can<00:01:07.740> actually<00:01:07.860> shrink

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
configured and it can actually shrink

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.789 
configured and it can actually shrink
down<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.880> minimum<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.570> 10<00:01:10.200> gigabytes<00:01:10.680> of

second virtual machine we can actually
see<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.909> men<00:01:21.090> we<00:01:21.210> get<00:01:21.360> allocated<00:01:21.780> by<00:01:22.250> hyper-v

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
see the men we get allocated by hyper-v

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.969 
see the men we get allocated by hyper-v
and<00:01:23.570> we<00:01:24.570> can<00:01:24.750> see<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.229> machine<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:25.830> now

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
and we can see that that machine is now

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.310 
and we can see that that machine is now
effectively<00:01:26.430> consuming<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.570> 10<00:01:27.810> gigabytes

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
effectively consuming the 10 gigabytes

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.679 
effectively consuming the 10 gigabytes
of<00:01:28.500> memory<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.040> if<00:01:29.640> we<00:01:29.759> go<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.150> memory<00:01:30.450> tab

of memory and if we go to the memory tab

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.330 
of memory and if we go to the memory tab
we<00:01:31.049> can<00:01:31.079> see<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.530> memory<00:01:31.860> has<00:01:32.009> actually<00:01:32.220> been

hopefully<00:01:54.000> we'll<00:01:54.240> see<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.540> virtual<00:01:54.869> machine

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
hopefully we'll see the virtual machine

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.429 
hopefully we'll see the virtual machine
boot<00:01:56.009> at<00:01:56.159> this<00:01:56.280> moment<00:01:56.460> in<00:01:56.670> time<00:01:57.320> one<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.350> the

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
boot at this moment in time one of the

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.480 
boot at this moment in time one of the
things<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:58.619> becomes<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.040> bit<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.280> problem

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
things that becomes a bit of a problem

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.789 
things that becomes a bit of a problem
in<00:01:59.759> this<00:01:59.850> scenario<00:02:00.060> though<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:00.930> if<00:02:01.500> we<00:02:01.649> are

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
in this scenario though is if we are

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.639 
in this scenario though is if we are
dark<00:02:02.219> intense<00:02:02.640> memory<00:02:03.030> pressures<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:04.110> we've

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
dark intense memory pressures and we've

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.499 
dark intense memory pressures and we've
got<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:04.860> machine<00:02:05.219> that<00:02:05.399> has<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.579> high<00:02:05.850> startup

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509

okay<00:02:12.670> so<00:02:13.630> we<00:02:13.750> can<00:02:13.900> see<00:02:14.050> now<00:02:14.200> in<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.410> memory

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
okay so we can see now in the memory

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.170 
okay so we can see now in the memory
statistics<00:02:15.250> that<00:02:15.370> actually<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.880> memory

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
statistics that actually the memory

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.560 
statistics that actually the memory
requirements<00:02:16.810> quite<00:02:17.020> low<00:02:17.230> only<00:02:18.570> 700

megabytes<00:02:19.870> even<00:02:20.860> though<00:02:20.950> we've<00:02:21.100> got<00:02:21.220> 10<00:02:21.430> gig

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670

megabytes even though we've got 10 gig
allocated<00:02:22.300> to<00:02:22.450> it<00:02:22.480> if<00:02:23.290> we<00:02:23.530> look<00:02:23.650> at<00:02:23.740> my<00:02:23.890> third

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
allocated to it if we look at my third

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.590 
allocated to it if we look at my third
virtual<00:02:24.700> machine<00:02:25.030> you<00:02:25.210> can<00:02:25.390> see<00:02:25.570> that

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
virtual machine you can see that

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.350 
virtual machine you can see that
requires<00:02:26.170> four<00:02:26.530> gig<00:02:26.740> of<00:02:26.890> ram<00:02:27.360> statically

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
requires four gig of ram statically

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.970 
requires four gig of ram statically
allocated<00:02:28.480> so<00:02:28.960> I<00:02:28.990> don't<00:02:29.260> have<00:02:29.440> enough<00:02:29.710> memory

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
allocated so I don't have enough memory

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.030 
allocated so I don't have enough memory
left<00:02:30.310> in<00:02:30.520> the<00:02:30.610> machine<00:02:31.050> so<00:02:32.050> if<00:02:32.170> i<00:02:32.290> go<00:02:32.440> to<00:02:32.470> start

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
left in the machine so if i go to start

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.430 
left in the machine so if i go to start
that<00:02:33.310> virtual<00:02:33.790> machine<00:02:34.150> hopefully<00:02:35.140> what<00:02:35.290> we

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
that virtual machine hopefully what we

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.310 
that virtual machine hopefully what we
should<00:02:35.650> see<00:02:35.950> is<00:02:36.190> that<00:02:37.180> is<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.780> dynamic<00:02:37.960> memory

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
should see is that is the dynamic memory

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.560 
should see is that is the dynamic memory
kick<00:02:38.710> in<00:02:38.950> so<00:02:39.520> we<00:02:39.610> can<00:02:39.640> actually<00:02:40.060> see<00:02:40.270> that<00:02:40.450> it

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
kick in so we can actually see that it

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.140 
kick in so we can actually see that it
actually<00:02:40.630> squeezes<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.710> memory<00:02:42.130> for<00:02:42.910> my

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
actually squeezes the memory for my

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.300 
actually squeezes the memory for my
second<00:02:43.660> virtual<00:02:43.870> machine<00:02:44.380> down<00:02:44.650> and<00:02:45.160> it's

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
second virtual machine down and it's

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.740 
second virtual machine down and it's
actually<00:02:45.460> squeezed<00:02:46.000> it<00:02:46.150> white<00:02:46.330> the<00:02:46.450> way<00:02:46.540> down

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
actually squeezed it white the way down

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.140 
actually squeezed it white the way down
to<00:02:46.810> one<00:02:47.170> gigabyte<00:02:47.670> basically<00:02:48.670> it<00:02:48.880> doesn't

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
to one gigabyte basically it doesn't

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.570 
to one gigabyte basically it doesn't
needle<00:02:49.390> that<00:02:49.510> memory<00:02:49.870> it's<00:02:50.650> not<00:02:50.830> consuming<00:02:51.430> it

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
needle that memory it's not consuming it

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.960 
needle that memory it's not consuming it
so<00:02:51.700> we're<00:02:51.820> going<00:02:51.910> to<00:02:52.000> take<00:02:52.150> it<00:02:52.210> away<00:02:52.420> from<00:02:52.600> it

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
so we're going to take it away from it

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.310 
so we're going to take it away from it
so<00:02:54.970> we're<00:02:55.120> now<00:02:55.210> in<00:02:55.360> a<00:02:55.450> situation<00:02:55.570> where<00:02:56.230> I've

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
so we're now in a situation where I've

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.110 
so we're now in a situation where I've
got<00:02:56.470> free<00:02:56.710> virtual<00:02:56.980> machines<00:02:57.520> running<00:02:57.670> off<00:02:58.030> to

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
got free virtual machines running off to

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.640 
got free virtual machines running off to
the<00:02:58.210> third<00:02:58.420> virtual<00:02:59.140> machine<00:02:59.380> is<00:02:59.500> just

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
the third virtual machine is just

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.770 
the third virtual machine is just
starting<00:03:00.070> up<00:03:00.190> but<00:03:01.000> the<00:03:01.060> problem<00:03:01.180> is<00:03:01.510> I've<00:03:01.750> got

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
starting up but the problem is I've got

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.440 
starting up but the problem is I've got
the<00:03:02.050> memory<00:03:02.260> hyper-v<00:03:02.920> is<00:03:02.950> consuming<00:03:03.610> I've<00:03:04.210> got

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
the memory hyper-v is consuming I've got

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.450 
the memory hyper-v is consuming I've got
the<00:03:04.570> memory<00:03:04.810> my<00:03:05.110> first<00:03:05.380> virtual<00:03:05.710> machines<00:03:06.220> can

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 
the memory my first virtual machines can

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.370 
the memory my first virtual machines can
consume<00:03:07.120> it<00:03:07.270> and<00:03:07.360> I've<00:03:07.570> got<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:07.750> memory<00:03:08.080> my

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
consume it and I've got the memory my

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.560 
consume it and I've got the memory my
second<00:03:08.860> virtual<00:03:09.040> machines<00:03:09.610> among<00:03:10.180> my<00:03:10.360> third

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
second virtual machines among my third

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.240 
second virtual machines among my third
virtual<00:03:10.930> machines<00:03:11.200> consuming<00:03:11.710> so

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
virtual machines consuming so

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.140 
virtual machines consuming so
effectively<00:03:12.700> I've<00:03:12.970> got<00:03:14.430> you<00:03:15.430> know<00:03:15.490> six<00:03:16.000> and<00:03:16.060> a

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
effectively I've got you know six and a

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.240 
effectively I've got you know six and a
half<00:03:16.210> to<00:03:16.750> seven<00:03:16.930> gigabytes<00:03:17.260> of<00:03:17.680> memory<00:03:17.830> being

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
half to seven gigabytes of memory being

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.580 
half to seven gigabytes of memory being
consumed<00:03:18.900> just<00:03:19.900> between<00:03:20.050> those<00:03:20.380> three

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
consumed just between those three

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.770 
consumed just between those three
objects<00:03:20.980> not<00:03:21.130> including<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:22.120> second<00:03:22.630> virtual

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
objects not including the second virtual

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.110 
objects not including the second virtual
machine<00:03:23.290> so<00:03:24.280> one<00:03:24.400> of<00:03:24.430> the<00:03:24.550> problems<00:03:24.820> I've<00:03:24.940> now

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
machine so one of the problems I've now

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.360 
machine so one of the problems I've now
got<00:03:25.450> is<00:03:26.050> if<00:03:26.200> I<00:03:26.290> were<00:03:26.410> to<00:03:26.530> try<00:03:26.709> and<00:03:26.860> restart<00:03:27.220> that

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
got is if I were to try and restart that

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.270 
got is if I were to try and restart that
second<00:03:27.910> virtual<00:03:28.060> machine<00:03:28.620> there's<00:03:29.620> not<00:03:29.860> ten

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
second virtual machine there's not ten

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.820 
second virtual machine there's not ten
gigabytes<00:03:30.580> of<00:03:31.060> memory<00:03:31.270> in<00:03:31.600> the<00:03:31.690> system<00:03:32.290> for

gigabytes of memory in the system for
the<00:03:32.920> memory<00:03:33.250> that<00:03:33.400> it<00:03:33.520> needs<00:03:33.730> so<00:03:34.660> if<00:03:34.930> I

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
the memory that it needs so if I

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.630 
the memory that it needs so if I
actually<00:03:35.170> try<00:03:35.470> to<00:03:35.530> restart<00:03:36.070> the<00:03:36.280> virtual

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
actually try to restart the virtual

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.660 
actually try to restart the virtual
machine<00:03:36.780> what<00:03:37.780> actually<00:03:37.990> happens<00:03:38.709> is<00:03:38.980> a

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670

hyper-v<00:03:40.180> tries<00:03:40.510> to<00:03:40.690> get<00:03:40.840> any<00:03:41.080> memory<00:03:41.650> from<00:03:42.220> any

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
hyper-v tries to get any memory from any

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.070 
hyper-v tries to get any memory from any
other<00:03:42.550> virtual<00:03:43.120> machines<00:03:43.420> that<00:03:43.570> it<00:03:43.690> can<00:03:43.900> and

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
other virtual machines that it can and

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.420 
other virtual machines that it can and
because<00:03:44.200> my<00:03:44.350> other<00:03:44.560> virtual<00:03:44.980> machines<00:03:45.250> are

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
because my other virtual machines are

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.970 
because my other virtual machines are
configured<00:03:45.940> for<00:03:46.090> static<00:03:46.510> memory<00:03:46.720> it<00:03:47.530> can't

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
configured for static memory it can't

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.270 
configured for static memory it can't
take<00:03:48.310> memory<00:03:48.820> away<00:03:49.060> from<00:03:49.330> those<00:03:49.890> so<00:03:50.890> the<00:03:50.920> only

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
take memory away from those so the only

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.940 
take memory away from those so the only
thing<00:03:51.430> it<00:03:51.670> can<00:03:51.850> do<00:03:52.030> to<00:03:52.270> ensure<00:03:52.420> that<00:03:52.870> the<00:03:53.080> which

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
thing it can do to ensure that the which

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.620 
thing it can do to ensure that the which
this<00:03:54.160> machine<00:03:54.490> can<00:03:54.700> be<00:03:54.850> restarted

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
this machine can be restarted

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.750 
this machine can be restarted
successfully<00:03:56.380> is<00:03:56.890> it<00:03:57.100> can<00:03:57.250> actually<00:03:57.400> leverage

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
successfully is it can actually leverage

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.500 
successfully is it can actually leverage
some<00:03:58.390> disc<00:03:58.870> swap<00:03:59.410> file<00:03:59.880> for<00:04:00.880> the<00:04:00.970> purpose<00:04:01.480> of

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
some disc swap file for the purpose of

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.630 
some disc swap file for the purpose of

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
actually being able to start up this

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.070 
actually being able to start up this
virtual<00:04:04.120> machine<00:04:05.520> so<00:04:06.520> smart<00:04:06.850> paging<00:04:07.360> allows

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
virtual machine so smart paging allows

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.290 
virtual machine so smart paging allows
me<00:04:08.350> allows<00:04:08.920> a<00:04:08.950> virtual<00:04:09.430> machine<00:04:09.760> to<00:04:09.970> actually

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
me allows a virtual machine to actually

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.400 
me allows a virtual machine to actually
consume<00:04:10.750> disk<00:04:11.350> space<00:04:11.739> as<00:04:12.010> RAM<00:04:12.959> only<00:04:13.959> why<00:04:14.200> it's

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
consume disk space as RAM only why it's

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.340 
consume disk space as RAM only why it's
booting<00:04:15.030> so<00:04:16.030> it<00:04:16.239> is<00:04:16.270> important<00:04:17.109> to<00:04:17.200> be<00:04:17.320> aware

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
booting so it is important to be aware

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.039 
booting so it is important to be aware
this<00:04:17.770> is<00:04:17.830> a<00:04:17.950> very<00:04:18.220> unique<00:04:18.459> scenario<00:04:19.049> smart

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
this is a very unique scenario smart

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.380 
this is a very unique scenario smart
paging<00:04:20.470> will<00:04:20.590> not<00:04:20.799> come<00:04:21.040> into<00:04:21.190> effect<00:04:21.370> if<00:04:22.150> I

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
paging will not come into effect if I

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.920 
paging will not come into effect if I
was<00:04:22.510> to<00:04:22.660> shut<00:04:22.930> this<00:04:23.169> machine

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
was to shut this machine

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.320 
was to shut this machine
and<00:04:24.919> effectively<00:04:25.370> power<00:04:25.699> it<00:04:25.880> off<00:04:26.030> and<00:04:26.300> then

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
and effectively power it off and then

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.350 
and effectively power it off and then
try<00:04:26.810> to<00:04:26.840> start<00:04:27.229> it<00:04:27.380> again<00:04:27.530> it<00:04:28.340> only<00:04:28.610> comes<00:04:28.910> into

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
try to start it again it only comes into

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.680 
try to start it again it only comes into
effect<00:04:29.919> because<00:04:30.919> the<00:04:31.370> machine<00:04:31.729> is<00:04:31.910> restarting

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
effect because the machine is restarting

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.230 
effect because the machine is restarting
so<00:04:32.900> I've<00:04:32.990> hit<00:04:33.139> the<00:04:33.259> restart<00:04:33.470> option<00:04:34.160> now<00:04:34.340> to

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
so I've hit the restart option now to

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.800 
so I've hit the restart option now to
actually<00:04:35.389> demonstrate<00:04:36.460> smart<00:04:37.460> paging<00:04:37.940> so<00:04:38.780> I

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
actually demonstrate smart paging so I

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.890 
actually demonstrate smart paging so I
lost<00:04:38.960> you<00:04:39.110> press<00:04:39.320> ok<00:04:40.150> so<00:04:41.150> that's<00:04:41.539> why<00:04:41.630> I<00:04:41.660> didn't

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
lost you press ok so that's why I didn't

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.689 
lost you press ok so that's why I didn't
also<00:04:42.020> use<00:04:42.199> the<00:04:42.380> hyper-v<00:04:42.770> tools<00:04:43.190> closely<00:04:43.580> that

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:43.699 
also use the hyper-v tools closely that

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:45.550 
also use the hyper-v tools closely that
we<00:04:43.759> don't<00:04:43.850> just<00:04:44.090> let<00:04:44.210> me<00:04:44.300> shut<00:04:44.509> it<00:04:44.660> down<00:04:44.810> so

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
we don't just let me shut it down so

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.170 
we don't just let me shut it down so
when<00:04:45.680> we<00:04:45.800> actually<00:04:45.979> bring<00:04:46.639> the<00:04:46.729> machine<00:04:47.030> down

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
when we actually bring the machine down

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.090 
when we actually bring the machine down
we're<00:04:47.360> now<00:04:47.509> trying<00:04:47.810> to<00:04:47.930> actually<00:04:48.229> retrieve

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
we're now trying to actually retrieve

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.550 
we're now trying to actually retrieve
memory<00:04:49.520> from<00:04:49.639> other<00:04:49.850> places<00:04:50.120> so<00:04:51.020> you<00:04:51.080> can<00:04:51.320> see

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
memory from other places so you can see

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.590 
memory from other places so you can see
we've<00:04:52.160> actually<00:04:52.310> had<00:04:52.610> to<00:04:52.759> go<00:04:52.880> into<00:04:53.060> paging

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
we've actually had to go into paging

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.499 
we've actually had to go into paging
mode<00:04:53.810> so<00:04:54.470> you<00:04:54.500> can<00:04:54.710> see<00:04:54.889> the<00:04:55.039> memory<00:04:55.430> status<00:04:56.000> is

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:56.509 
mode so you can see the memory status is

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:59.740 
mode so you can see the memory status is
now<00:04:56.750> sitting<00:04:57.050> at<00:04:57.320> paging<00:04:57.860> ok<00:04:58.789> so<00:04:59.479> actually<00:04:59.539> the

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
now sitting at paging ok so actually the

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:00.820 
now sitting at paging ok so actually the
virtual<00:05:00.050> machine<00:05:00.110> is<00:05:00.349> going<00:05:00.380> to<00:05:00.530> boot<00:05:00.710> a

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
virtual machine is going to boot a

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.390 
virtual machine is going to boot a
little<00:05:02.530> because<00:05:03.530> we're<00:05:03.710> actually<00:05:03.860> swapping

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
little because we're actually swapping

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.120 
little because we're actually swapping
elements<00:05:04.880> I<00:05:05.000> out<00:05:05.270> to<00:05:05.300> disk<00:05:05.690> but<00:05:06.650> as<00:05:06.800> soon<00:05:06.979> as

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
elements I out to disk but as soon as

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.980 
elements I out to disk but as soon as
the<00:05:07.280> actual<00:05:07.430> virtual<00:05:07.759> machine<00:05:08.270> as<00:05:08.479> we<00:05:08.690> start

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
the actual virtual machine as we start

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.070 
the actual virtual machine as we start
it<00:05:09.229> and<00:05:09.380> actually<00:05:09.530> come<00:05:09.860> online<00:05:10.300> the<00:05:11.300> memory

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
it and actually come online the memory

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.990 
it and actually come online the memory
drivers<00:05:12.440> the<00:05:12.590> blue<00:05:12.800> memory<00:05:13.220> drivers<00:05:13.610> inside

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
drivers the blue memory drivers inside

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.480 
drivers the blue memory drivers inside
the<00:05:14.150> virtual<00:05:14.330> machine<00:05:14.919> squeeze<00:05:15.919> the<00:05:16.160> memory

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
the virtual machine squeeze the memory

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.129 
the virtual machine squeeze the memory
requirements<00:05:17.180> for<00:05:17.300> that<00:05:17.389> virtual<00:05:17.599> machine

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:18.139 
requirements for that virtual machine

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:21.339 
requirements for that virtual machine
down<00:05:18.440> so<00:05:19.430> that<00:05:19.460> it<00:05:19.820> will<00:05:19.940> actually<00:05:20.120> be<00:05:20.990> able<00:05:21.110> to

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:21.349 
down so that it will actually be able to

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:25.659 
down so that it will actually be able to
remove<00:05:21.680> the<00:05:21.919> use<00:05:22.130> of<00:05:22.160> that<00:05:22.610> paging<00:05:23.090> file<00:05:24.669> so

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
remove the use of that paging file so

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:28.930 
remove the use of that paging file so
this<00:05:25.849> is<00:05:25.970> just<00:05:26.120> a<00:05:26.300> temporary<00:05:27.490> feature<00:05:28.490> that<00:05:28.789> we

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
this is just a temporary feature that we

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.089 
this is just a temporary feature that we
have<00:05:29.180> while<00:05:30.020> virtual<00:05:30.530> machines<00:05:30.889> are

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:31.099 
have while virtual machines are

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:33.580 
have while virtual machines are
rebooting<00:05:31.669> and<00:05:32.090> the<00:05:32.330> system<00:05:32.720> is<00:05:32.840> under<00:05:33.050> memory

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
rebooting and the system is under memory

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.810 
rebooting and the system is under memory
pressures<00:05:33.979> we<00:05:34.130> can't<00:05:34.370> allocate<00:05:34.849> enough<00:05:35.380> ram

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
pressures we can't allocate enough ram

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.000 
pressures we can't allocate enough ram
specifically<00:05:37.820> for<00:05:38.150> the<00:05:38.690> virtual<00:05:38.900> machine<00:05:39.229> so

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010 
specifically for the virtual machine so

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:41.890 
specifically for the virtual machine so
this<00:05:40.159> obviously<00:05:40.310> could<00:05:40.820> be<00:05:41.000> scenarios<00:05:41.630> where

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
this obviously could be scenarios where

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.399 
this obviously could be scenarios where
we've<00:05:42.139> got<00:05:42.470> virtual<00:05:43.340> desktop<00:05:43.639> infrastructure

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:44.409 
we've got virtual desktop infrastructure

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:46.390 
we've got virtual desktop infrastructure
where<00:05:45.409> we<00:05:45.530> might<00:05:45.710> actually<00:05:45.949> configure

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
where we might actually configure

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.600 
where we might actually configure
machine<00:05:46.760> for<00:05:46.909> the<00:05:46.940> ability<00:05:47.300> to<00:05:47.449> actually<00:05:48.080> have

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
machine for the ability to actually have

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.890 
machine for the ability to actually have
significant<00:05:49.610> memory<00:05:49.760> when<00:05:50.090> they<00:05:50.240> start<00:05:50.510> up<00:05:50.750> so

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
significant memory when they start up so

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.469 
significant memory when they start up so
they<00:05:50.990> boot<00:05:51.260> fast<00:05:51.560> but<00:05:52.340> actually<00:05:52.820> then

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:53.479 
they boot fast but actually then

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:55.540 
they boot fast but actually then
minimize<00:05:54.380> the<00:05:54.650> memory<00:05:54.949> they<00:05:55.070> might<00:05:55.280> use

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
minimize the memory they might use

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.180 
minimize the memory they might use
during<00:05:56.300> during<00:05:56.599> the<00:05:56.720> normal<00:05:56.990> operations<00:05:57.650> or

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
during during the normal operations or

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.219 
during during the normal operations or
we<00:05:58.310> might<00:05:58.430> have<00:05:58.669> specific<00:05:59.180> server<00:05:59.479> solutions

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:00.229 
we might have specific server solutions

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:02.020 
we might have specific server solutions
where<00:06:00.470> again<00:06:01.130> to<00:06:01.340> actually<00:06:01.580> get<00:06:01.729> that<00:06:01.880> machine

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030 
where again to actually get that machine

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.480 
where again to actually get that machine
started<00:06:02.780> quickly<00:06:03.139> we<00:06:03.919> actually<00:06:04.220> give<00:06:04.370> it<00:06:04.460> a

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
started quickly we actually give it a

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.060 
started quickly we actually give it a
lot<00:06:04.759> more<00:06:04.909> memory<00:06:05.270> than<00:06:05.300> potentially<00:06:05.919> that<00:06:06.919> it

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.070 
lot more memory than potentially that it

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.149 
lot more memory than potentially that it
needs<00:06:07.310> to<00:06:07.520> actually<00:06:07.669> run<00:06:08.000> during<00:06:08.240> most<00:06:08.509> of<00:06:08.659> its

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:09.159 
needs to actually run during most of its

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:12.730 
needs to actually run during most of its
operational<00:06:10.159> hours<00:06:10.750> so<00:06:11.750> hopefully<00:06:11.960> we<00:06:12.560> should

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 
operational hours so hopefully we should

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.760 
operational hours so hopefully we should
be<00:06:12.830> getting<00:06:12.949> fairly<00:06:13.340> close<00:06:13.699> to<00:06:14.120> the<00:06:14.930> all<00:06:15.380> the

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
be getting fairly close to the all the

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.290 
be getting fairly close to the all the

memory drivers loading if you've got to

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.999 
memory drivers loading if you've got to
wait<00:06:17.449> for<00:06:17.479> I'll<00:06:18.020> see<00:06:18.199> all<00:06:18.320> the<00:06:18.440> services<00:06:18.860> to

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:19.009 
wait for I'll see all the services to

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:20.770 
wait for I'll see all the services to
come<00:06:19.159> up<00:06:19.310> inside<00:06:19.610> the<00:06:19.759> machine<00:06:20.060> with<00:06:20.690> the

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 
come up inside the machine with the

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.870 
come up inside the machine with the
integration<00:06:21.289> services<00:06:21.740> as<00:06:21.919> well<00:06:21.949> and<00:06:22.849> we

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 
integration services as well and we

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.510 
integration services as well and we
should<00:06:23.180> actually<00:06:23.360> see<00:06:23.840> that<00:06:24.590> the<00:06:24.800> memory

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 
should actually see that the memory

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.300 
should actually see that the memory
status<00:06:25.970> will<00:06:26.150> go<00:06:26.300> from<00:06:26.599> paging<00:06:27.289> and<00:06:27.500> we'll

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:28.310 
status will go from paging and we'll

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.740 
status will go from paging and we'll
actually<00:06:28.460> have<00:06:28.669> the<00:06:29.030> sort<00:06:29.210> of<00:06:29.270> normal<00:06:29.570> memory

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:29.750 
actually have the sort of normal memory

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.190 
actually have the sort of normal memory
statistics<00:06:30.440> in<00:06:30.710> in<00:06:31.009> the<00:06:31.130> book<00:06:31.750> so<00:06:32.750> as<00:06:32.870> we<00:06:33.020> can

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:33.200 
statistics in in the book so as we can

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.100 
statistics in in the book so as we can
see<00:06:33.409> now<00:06:34.090> now<00:06:35.090> has<00:06:35.270> actually<00:06:35.539> worked<00:06:35.570> out<00:06:35.930> what

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.110 
see now now has actually worked out what

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:37.570 
see now now has actually worked out what
the<00:06:36.200> memory<00:06:36.500> demand<00:06:36.860> for<00:06:37.130> the<00:06:37.190> virtue

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:37.580 
the memory demand for the virtue

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.790 
the memory demand for the virtue
machine<00:06:37.879> is<00:06:38.060> so<00:06:38.300> just<00:06:38.509> over<00:06:38.840> the<00:06:38.960> 700

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800 
machine is so just over the 700

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.429 
machine is so just over the 700
megabytes<00:06:40.069> of<00:06:40.340> memory<00:06:40.810> so<00:06:41.810> the<00:06:41.930> system<00:06:42.319> will

00:06:42.429 --> 00:06:42.439 
megabytes of memory so the system will

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:43.869 
megabytes of memory so the system will
then<00:06:42.590> be<00:06:42.740> going<00:06:42.770> through<00:06:43.159> the<00:06:43.310> process<00:06:43.520> of

00:06:43.869 --> 00:06:43.879 
then be going through the process of

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:46.510 
then be going through the process of
actually<00:06:44.240> reclaiming<00:06:44.930> the<00:06:45.409> memory<00:06:45.800> back<00:06:46.039> from

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.520 
actually reclaiming the memory back from

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.730 
actually reclaiming the memory back from
the<00:06:46.639> system<00:06:47.030> and<00:06:47.659> actually<00:06:48.050> get<00:06:48.229> rid<00:06:48.439> to<00:06:48.560> get

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:48.740 
the system and actually get rid to get

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.409 
the system and actually get rid to get
rid<00:06:48.889> of<00:06:48.919> that<00:06:49.129> paging<00:06:49.580> file<00:06:49.819> that's<00:06:50.090> actually

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:50.419 
rid of that paging file that's actually

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:52.480 
rid of that paging file that's actually
the<00:06:51.050> currently<00:06:51.469> in<00:06:51.560> use<00:06:51.740> so<00:06:51.979> we<00:06:52.069> should<00:06:52.280> be

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:52.490 
the currently in use so we should be

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.700 
the currently in use so we should be
quite<00:06:53.300> close<00:06:53.599> to<00:06:53.810> the<00:06:53.900> completion<00:06:54.439> of<00:06:54.530> that

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:54.710 
quite close to the completion of that

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:58.510 
quite close to the completion of that
activity<00:06:56.680> so<00:06:57.680> we<00:06:57.800> can<00:06:57.919> see<00:06:58.069> the<00:06:58.189> virtual

00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:58.520 
activity so we can see the virtual

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.520 
activity so we can see the virtual
machines<00:06:58.789> out<00:06:59.000> and<00:06:59.449> obviously<00:06:59.659> we<00:06:59.870> could<00:07:00.050> sign

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:00.530 
machines out and obviously we could sign

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.890 
machines out and obviously we could sign
into<00:07:00.800> the<00:07:00.889> virtual<00:07:01.039> machine<00:07:01.479> so<00:07:02.479> the<00:07:02.569> virtual

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:02.900 
into the virtual machine so the virtual

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:08.679 
into the virtual machine so the virtual
machines<00:07:03.199> all<00:07:03.409> operational<00:07:07.240> and<00:07:08.240> if<00:07:08.360> we<00:07:08.509> just

00:07:08.679 --> 00:07:08.689 
machines all operational and if we just

00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:10.659 
machines all operational and if we just
review<00:07:09.229> the<00:07:09.379> memory<00:07:09.710> information<00:07:10.280> you<00:07:10.520> can

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:10.669 
review the memory information you can

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:13.029 
review the memory information you can
now<00:07:10.819> actually<00:07:11.030> see<00:07:11.479> the<00:07:12.229> memories<00:07:12.590> basically

00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:13.039 
now actually see the memories basically

00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:14.860 
now actually see the memories basically
been<00:07:13.250> squeezed<00:07:14.090> down<00:07:14.240> to<00:07:14.449> the<00:07:14.539> assigned

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:14.870 
been squeezed down to the assigned

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:18.040 
been squeezed down to the assigned
memory<00:07:15.669> and<00:07:16.669> basically<00:07:17.210> the<00:07:17.389> memory<00:07:17.659> status

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:18.050 
memory and basically the memory status

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.409 
memory and basically the memory status
is<00:07:18.199> now<00:07:18.349> okay<00:07:18.710> indicating<00:07:19.430> that<00:07:19.639> the<00:07:20.240> about

00:07:20.409 --> 00:07:20.419 
is now okay indicating that the about

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:22.899 
is now okay indicating that the about
the<00:07:21.169> bits<00:07:21.349> of<00:07:21.500> memory<00:07:21.680> that<00:07:21.830> was<00:07:22.069> missing<00:07:22.460> eg

00:07:22.899 --> 00:07:22.909 
the bits of memory that was missing eg

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:24.640 
the bits of memory that was missing eg
the<00:07:22.940> sort<00:07:23.300> of<00:07:23.389> seven<00:07:23.659> and<00:07:23.719> a<00:07:23.810> bit<00:07:23.930> gigabytes<00:07:24.409> to

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:24.650 
the sort of seven and a bit gigabytes to

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:28.450 
the sort of seven and a bit gigabytes to
the<00:07:24.800> 10<00:07:25.550> gigabytes<00:07:26.060> is<00:07:26.270> no<00:07:26.599> longer<00:07:27.460> being

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:28.460 
the 10 gigabytes is no longer being

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.619 
the 10 gigabytes is no longer being
