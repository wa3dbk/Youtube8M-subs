and if you remember iTunes ping always a

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.099 
and if you remember iTunes ping always a
major<00:03:07.700> failure<00:03:08.030> it<00:03:08.239> only<00:03:08.389> lasted<00:03:08.780> for<00:03:08.930> two

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:09.109 
major failure it only lasted for two

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:11.229 
major failure it only lasted for two
years<00:03:09.349> and<00:03:09.560> it<00:03:10.189> cut<00:03:10.639> off<00:03:10.760> facebook

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
years and it cut off facebook

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:12.670 
years and it cut off facebook
integration<00:03:11.450> right<00:03:11.989> at<00:03:12.079> the<00:03:12.169> beginning<00:03:12.290> which

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
integration right at the beginning which

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.800 
integration right at the beginning which
was<00:03:12.980> a<00:03:13.010> big<00:03:13.250> feature<00:03:13.519> and<00:03:13.909> it<00:03:14.359> just<00:03:14.540> didn't

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
was a big feature and it just didn't

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.000 
was a big feature and it just didn't
work<00:03:14.959> and<00:03:15.199> so<00:03:15.290> i<00:03:15.319> think<00:03:15.409> this<00:03:15.680> is<00:03:15.739> apple's

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
work and so i think this is apple's

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.069 
work and so i think this is apple's
second<00:03:16.579> and<00:03:16.699> hopefully<00:03:17.150> successful<00:03:17.780> attempt

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
second and hopefully successful attempt

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.580 
second and hopefully successful attempt
trying<00:03:18.859> to<00:03:19.069> reach<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:20.359> end<00:03:20.629> user<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:21.049> fan<00:03:21.409> of

reading<00:06:09.110> about<00:06:09.289> that<00:06:09.469> but<00:06:10.099> artists<00:06:10.550> just

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:10.729 
reading about that but artists just

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:12.490 
reading about that but artists just
wouldn't<00:06:11.029> agree<00:06:11.270> and<00:06:11.539> so<00:06:11.810> I<00:06:11.839> guess<00:06:12.199> this<00:06:12.379> is
