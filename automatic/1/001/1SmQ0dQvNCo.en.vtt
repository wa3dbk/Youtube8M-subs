00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.979 
create substrate now futures gonna have
low<00:02:19.290> light<00:02:19.590> of<00:02:19.739> quite<00:02:20.040> low<00:02:20.430> light<00:02:20.700> plants<00:02:21.030> then

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
low light of quite low light plants then

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.890 
low light of quite low light plants then
you<00:02:22.410> don't<00:02:22.590> need<00:02:22.830> that<00:02:23.700> great<00:02:24.150> of<00:02:24.330> a<00:02:24.420> fancy

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
you don't need that great of a fancy

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.220 
you don't need that great of a fancy
substrate<00:02:25.440> I<00:02:25.680> would<00:02:26.489> say<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:27.170> you<00:02:28.170> know

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
substrate I would say and you know

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.890 
substrate I would say and you know
because<00:02:28.680> low<00:02:28.980> light<00:02:29.190> plants<00:02:29.519> absorb

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
because low light plants absorb

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.170 
because low light plants absorb
nutrients<00:02:30.900> really<00:02:31.440> slow<00:02:31.739> and<00:02:32.040> it<00:02:32.760> takes<00:02:33.030> a

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
nutrients really slow and it takes a

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.729 
nutrients really slow and it takes a
while<00:02:33.690> for<00:02:33.720> them<00:02:34.319> to<00:02:35.810> take<00:02:36.810> in<00:02:36.989> the<00:02:37.140> nutrients

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739

planet<00:02:54.569> tank<00:02:54.810> it<00:02:55.019> is<00:02:55.680> a<00:02:55.709> must<00:02:56.430> that<00:02:56.849> you<00:02:57.390> get

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
planet tank it is a must that you get

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.470 
planet tank it is a must that you get
co2<00:02:58.200> in<00:02:58.590> there<00:02:58.799> if<00:02:59.340> you<00:02:59.579> do<00:02:59.700> not<00:02:59.879> have<00:03:00.209> that

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
co2 in there if you do not have that

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.650 
co2 in there if you do not have that
then<00:03:01.019> it's<00:03:01.860> gonna<00:03:02.129> go<00:03:02.400> out<00:03:02.430> of<00:03:02.610> whack<00:03:02.879> and<00:03:03.209> you

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
then it's gonna go out of whack and you

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.309 
then it's gonna go out of whack and you
know<00:03:04.879> Excel<00:03:05.879> is<00:03:06.090> not<00:03:06.120> gonna<00:03:06.450> cut<00:03:06.750> it<00:03:06.780> for<00:03:07.140> it

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
know Excel is not gonna cut it for it

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.970 
know Excel is not gonna cut it for it
and<00:03:08.269> it's<00:03:09.269> just<00:03:09.360> it's<00:03:10.110> gonna<00:03:10.319> cost<00:03:10.650> you<00:03:10.829> a<00:03:10.890> lot

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
and it's just it's gonna cost you a lot

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
and it's just it's gonna cost you a lot
of<00:03:11.160> trouble<00:03:11.629> if<00:03:12.629> you<00:03:12.930> have<00:03:13.140> low<00:03:13.560> light<00:03:14.000> plants

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
of trouble if you have low light plants

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.809 
of trouble if you have low light plants
then<00:03:15.810> you<00:03:16.170> can<00:03:16.349> get<00:03:16.530> away<00:03:16.620> without<00:03:17.400> getting

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
then you can get away without getting

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.140 
then you can get away without getting
co2<00:03:18.480> because<00:03:19.410> they<00:03:19.590> don't<00:03:19.799> require<00:03:20.069> much<00:03:20.549> and

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
co2 because they don't require much and

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.690 
co2 because they don't require much and
what<00:03:21.299> you<00:03:21.389> can<00:03:21.540> do<00:03:21.750> is<00:03:22.049> get<00:03:22.290> this<00:03:22.530> excel<00:03:23.489> right

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
what you can do is get this excel right

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.270 
what you can do is get this excel right
here<00:03:23.880> and<00:03:24.389> dose<00:03:25.019> with<00:03:25.260> that<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:25.769> you<00:03:26.100> should

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
here and dose with that and you should

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.569 
here and dose with that and you should
be<00:03:26.400> good<00:03:26.549> to<00:03:26.609> go<00:03:27.410> now<00:03:28.519> the<00:03:29.519> number<00:03:29.970> four<00:03:30.269> is

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
be good to go now the number four is

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:34.550 
be good to go now the number four is
fertilizers<00:03:32.579> now<00:03:33.480> there's<00:03:33.900> a<00:03:33.989> lot<00:03:34.319> of

stuff but you need to find the one
that's<00:03:43.109> right<00:03:43.650> for<00:03:43.709> your<00:03:44.099> aquarium<00:03:44.340> if<00:03:45.060> you

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
that's right for your aquarium if you

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.839 
that's right for your aquarium if you

have really low light plants they don't
they're<00:03:48.180> not<00:03:48.209> gonna<00:03:48.510> need<00:03:48.810> fertilizers<00:03:50.090> for<00:03:51.090> a

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
they're not gonna need fertilizers for a

high light playing a tank with

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.110 
high light playing a tank with
highlights<00:04:07.319> means<00:04:08.010> you<00:04:08.280> need<00:04:08.489> more<00:04:08.849> co2<00:04:09.859> more

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
highlights means you need more co2 more

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.509 
highlights means you need more co2 more

I'm<00:04:30.420> not<00:04:30.450> gonna<00:04:30.780> go<00:04:30.990> into<00:04:31.170> it<00:04:31.350> because<00:04:31.650> I<00:04:31.830> know

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
I'm not gonna go into it because I know

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.320 
I'm not gonna go into it because I know
it<00:04:33.420> gets<00:04:33.810> confusing<00:04:34.380> so<00:04:35.040> those<00:04:35.730> are<00:04:35.880> the<00:04:36.030> four

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
it gets confusing so those are the four

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.600 
it gets confusing so those are the four
elements<00:04:36.930> that<00:04:37.110> I<00:04:37.320> found<00:04:37.710> guys<00:04:37.980> they're

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
elements that I found guys they're
