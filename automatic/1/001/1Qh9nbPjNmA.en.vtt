00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.480
 sometimes battery for headlamps 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.390
 which can be recharged many times 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.529
 it was designed by pizza for those 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.630
 who wants to improve workers 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.859
 characteristics of the headlamp as well 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.260
 reduce the harmful effects on 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:28.160
 environment 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.670
 the greatest harm to the environment 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.320
 cause it is disposable batteries 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.540
 alkaline batteries you have discarded 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.340
 are recyclable they are 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.790
 the main cause of pollution 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.800
 environment one battery core withstands 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:47.629
 over 300 charge cycles and can 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:50.059
 replace 900 disposable batteries by 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.340
 Essentially one battery core is 900 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.710
 conventional batteries 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.010
 he quickly pays for himself both economically and 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.010
 ecologically 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:04.640
 most people use headheads 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:06.440
 lights away from the mains but in 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.080
 battery core has a built-in 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:13.640
 charging to charge it is only needed 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.880
 wire and yusbi connector at home can be charged 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:22.280
 its from a regular outlet or from a computer 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:23.869
 in the car from the cigarette lighter in the trip 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.890
 can use portable charger 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.799
 device 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:32.180
 and on a long journey you can charge 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:34.220
 its from the solar battery on trips you 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.900
 no need to carry extra weight you 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.880
 can use the same charge 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.890
 which you charge mobile phone 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.170
 or player and lithium ion polymer 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.390
 core battery is adjustable 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.939
 energy source for headlamp 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.979
 your lantern will no longer go out at the most 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.079
 the wrong moment you can also 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.990
 adjust battery life 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:55.070
 to make it all night long 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.990
 it is very easy 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.409
 installing a special free 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.710
 program this program allows 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:06.830
 customize the lamp for any conditions of its 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.630
 the interface is simple and straightforward 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.970
 you can pre-program 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.880
 the modes you need and save them 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.620
 in the menu for quick access 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.190
 for example, you regularly use a flashlight 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.680
 for night running I do jogging 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.780
 rough terrain for 4 or 5 years in 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.480
 The first time I ran an ultra trail race 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.370
 mont blanc in 2007 is very important to 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.770
 light lantern enough for such a long 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.600
 distance eg ultra 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.970
 trail we turned on the lights at half past nine 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.700
 evenings and turned off only at 6 am 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.950
 Member Loik Blando Finishes Twice 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.570
 ultra trail race need such a source 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.820
 light which would be enough for 9 hours 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:49.280
 my workout lasts from an hour to three 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.170
 I use a programmable flashlight 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.930
 because I know how much I will 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.970
 use a lantern if it's a three-hour 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.280
 race I can program it on 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.270
 maximum brightness and not worry about 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.270
 energy charge 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.600
 when if you use the forehead 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.150
 reading light you can install 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.470
 any brightness using os program 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:18.400
 will hit the target by moving the slider in the program you 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.720
 see how the brightness of the lamp changes 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.460
 kids love headlamps 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.290
 but the bright light can blind them on 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.720
 some time now you can 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.790
 adjust the flashlight reducing its brightness this 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.210
 will be safe for children's eyes and at that 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.370
 same time 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.990
 will increase battery life even 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.030
 if the child falls asleep with the included 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.530
 flashlight you can easily recharge 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.030
 battery and not buy new 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.880
 batteries you no longer need 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.960
 worry about wasted batteries 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.720
 battery core is very easy and fast 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:47.560
 set lights series tikka 2 and 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.730
 zip to 2 open the battery compartment 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:56.390
 twisting movement detach 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:58.520
 mount take the lantern install 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.730
 battery so that the inscription 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:04.580
 core was inside the case check 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.100
 do both halves match up then 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:10.880
 two hands press the lantern 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:14.020
 closes make sure the lantern is tight 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.020
 closed top and bottom 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:21.760
 now take the battery cover 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:25.990
 insert the mount on one side and 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:29.030
 second hand close the bottom until it clicks 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.720
 close the lid lantern ready for 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.120
 use 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.160
 Now let's see how this is done in 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.930
 real time 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:40.550
 open the battery remove the attachment 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.470
 connects to click and paste 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.280
 mount 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:52.400
 ready to patch to charge the battery 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:55.250
 just remove the back cover and insert 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.140
 yusbi cord if the battery is still 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.650
 discharged you can at any time 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:03.290
 insert ordinary batteries for this 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:06.950
 you just need to open the lantern to get it 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:10.970
 connect the core battery until it clicks 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:13.090
 cover and insert the batteries while 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:16.430
 it is important to observe the polarity 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.590
 now close the lid lantern ready for 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.360
 use 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:23.390
 battery core rechargeable source 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.430
 energy eco-friendly and economical it 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.160
 easy to recharge thanks to built-in 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.150
 charging and usb port 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.980
 special program allows 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.610
 customize petzl headlamp 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.419
