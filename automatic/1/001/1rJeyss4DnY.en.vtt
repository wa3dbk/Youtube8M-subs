 To bathe my hair dry with the towel and 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.700
 I put this is like from here to down 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.550
 so that I am already entangled with a 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.309
 brush I enter and I brush it well 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.010
 all the knots and it makes me break 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.440
 at least the hair and until I can not 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.710
 aspire easier than these leagues and so 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.039

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.240

 stable bestial like like two bubbles of 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.970

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.550
 down and makes that when I dried my hair 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.770
 and alcalá for free I do not keep everything like that 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.530
 sad and with the spirits flying 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:10.890
 because I have too much hair like that 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.440
 I will have very Chinese but I have fluff and 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.060

 Dry oil is also for when it is 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.530
 damp 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.450
 if I do not use this I put this one because 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.330
 suppose they do the same things 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.990
 that 's all being treated but I feel that 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.640
 I like him more than him 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.560

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.210
 I just bought but I like that you do not 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.860
 the hair is not greasy if it is 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.680
 aesthetic oil about eating a lot 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.920
 before using dryer with iron 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:04.070

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:10.369
 mail I have treated other brands and stem 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.019
 witnesses so much more than the others and I do not 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.410
 like it has to be because there 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:17.690
 It has drug character is in Spanish it is 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.140

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:29.840
 He is the weakest and weakest I did not have it 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.819
 heavier what is already and I like 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.760
 He says he 's the one who makes your hair more 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.650
 strong and not decided or true 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.680
 because I lose my hair a lot 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.560
 excessively my hair falls out but 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.049
 I like it a lot and I've been around for four 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.060

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.790
 the presentations but I always bought 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.250

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.930
 small because here the big one I think and 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.819
 love feels like silk hair 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.370
 glove what you put on is quite expensive as 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:16.000
 about 14 dollars this little thing worries 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:18.969

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.920

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.280
 products that I have tried all my life 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:33.970

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:04.420
 what I'm looking for I do not like to do 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.020
 I applied this 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:11.140

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:13.750

 volume to the hair has as it were 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:32.350

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:34.330
 part of the hair you put this like this and 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.550

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:55.570
 for the days that we have time to 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:59.020
 bathing treachery food in taxis in the 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:02.229
 dark brown hair is my favorite I know 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.900
 that I taught them about two months ago or 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:07.630
 three of my favorites the other that 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.360
 I also like it but this one and this one 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.460
 he likes this more this is a 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.370
 little bit more expensive the other that there is and is 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:18.940
 with coupons and I found this one in 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:21.640
 follow me up to 450 good there is or not agreement 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.979
 but this whole thing as mature as month 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:28.180
 month and a half two and like the other one also 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:30.430
 this you put it on, you get like this and have 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:33.250
 also volume at the same time but nothing 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.410
 I recommend it more for hair and as for 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.960
 second 10 you do not bathe because you do not want 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:40.060
 put a shampoo on freshly washed hair 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:43.270
 as this may be point this newly 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:46.180
 washing is imposed with this if you carry about 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:48.580
 how many days without the hair part you 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.860

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:54.100
