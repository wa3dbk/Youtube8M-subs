00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.740
 Hello, after a pretty big 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.530
 break 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:54.200
 this marvelous 2d is back in service 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.030
 voting won the game fantasy star 4 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.710
 but I could not play right 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.309
 the number of hours to evaluate this 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.470
 masterpiece 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.690
 but anyway today we'll talk about the role 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.580
 in the game and not just role-playing yet 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.250
 tactical and yes fighting opinion 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.430
 single characters and union but about everything 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.430
 in order 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.570
 developed this game company sting 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.210
 2006 for gameboy advance console 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.190
 you don't know it as part of a series of pc games 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.440
 The first time I saw her was on gameboy 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.590
 advance but she did not impress me at all 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.360
 and in 2008 and and port to piisp 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.370
 sprites are redrawn and 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.380
 graphics look much more attractive 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.670
 the gameplay is getting a bit 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.670
 lighter than earlier version 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.439
 the main character of the game is a girl by 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.439
 the name of the kernel ekarny with something captures 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:52.689
 empire no not that but still ginger and 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.640
 our division recedes from captured 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:56.770
 the castles lock meeting a thief named 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.470
 Mila 0 and persuade him for half the kingdom 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.079
 help release the native castle here 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.159
 actually begins our adventure 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.110
 the most interesting thing in this game besides 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.829
 plots as I think it is mechanics itself 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.200
 games 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:09.759
 combat system is quite interesting 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.200
 at first glance it may seem that 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.780
 This is a clone of fire emblem 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.340
 but it is only at first glance after playing 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:21.069
 little do you understand that this is completely 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:23.019
 another game of this game we are fighting 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.700
 unions union consists of a leader and 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.380
 subordinates number from three to seven 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.599
 the person depends on the class 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.910
 almost a battle is fought on a map with a view 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.590
 on top of the battle video on the side of the battle 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.870
 can be influenced by various factors from 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.090
 time of day before the landscape to attack 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.099
 call can be one union but present 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.690
 so-called formations allowing 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.060
 attack with two three or four at once 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.459
 conjunctions as well as use during 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.109
 battlefield catapult and stuff by the way 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.620
 the number of moves depends directly on 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:49.620
 kart 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.450
 before each fight gives us the right to choose 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.160
 a certain number of cards each 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.209
 the card has a number of moves which 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.550
 can be done 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.680
 the card also has characteristics 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.660
 such protection is also a skill that can 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.940
 strengthen allies or hit enemies 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.790
 to use the skill you need to 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.569
 this bunch union leader had a weapon 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.250
 matching card type 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.860
 and some skill may 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.540
 use all attacking alliance also 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.209
 there are name cards such as 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.290
 thefts for cute burrow and also there are no cards 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.290
 tied to a weapon 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.519
 first of all to use skill 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.890
 you need to dial the skills scale of the media battle in 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.319
 passive mode on the cross to the left in 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.930
 This mode of attack your union is weaker 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:38.630
 there are also aggressive bench spider 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.340
 right with him so a union rises but 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.769
 ability to use this case is not 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.030
 it turns out the time should be divided into two 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.519
 type first type 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.319
 skill triggered after charging ie 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.840
 you need to hold down the button to charge 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:54.200
 scale and release it usually attacking u 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.359
 me and the second type of skill works when 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.660
 pressing the button is used while the button 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:01.160
 pressed but at the same time spending scale skills 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.459
 what skills can be attributed different 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.200
 sort of gain or magical barriers 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:08.120
 the skill pretty much can't fail 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.410
 affect the outcome of the battle the truth 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.660
 interesting skill that can 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.670
 change the course of the battle such as 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.500
 resurrection of the pasha member of the union or 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:21.530
 immortality strictly bound or to 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:22.970
 time of day or to class in game 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.950
 pretty big present 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.650
 amount of class with their type of weapon 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.870
 thieves swordsmen necromancers white magicians 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.510
 knights riders gryphon dragon 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.120
 killer archers even mermaids each 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.680
 their strengths and weaknesses 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.389
 for example the thief fights better in the mountain 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.860
 mermaid terrain the only class 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:41.840
 who can walk on water on 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.389
 tactical map thus giving free rein 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.520
 strategic thoughts are also in the game 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:49.610
 there are several classes of weapons such 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.080
 like swords and spears axes and bows and staffs 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.129
 weapons work on the principle 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.559
 rock Paper Scissors 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:57.229
 paper for example copy is stronger than swords 

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:59.479
 Omsk is stronger than its axes 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:02.449
 queue stronger copies of the whole thing 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:05.179
 weaker staff but stronger bow club like 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:09.559
 you already understood the staff so no 

00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:11.689
 the best weapons against all for playing 

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:14.389
 came out a few spin-offs blazer 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:16.099
 and gloria of the unit according to the statements 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:16.550
 developers scrambled to a new 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:18.499
 level 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.569
 Well, it's a pity they can not be evaluated in mind 

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:21.050
 the fact that the game tower only for horse 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:23.300
 of the market 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.749
 And in what games at random is not 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.749
 you get there 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.950
 in the end, the game got pretty 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.900
 nontrivial gameplay and can 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.700
 draw any amateur into practice yes 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.450
 what is really there her lover even whom i 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.910
 am 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:41.830
 but actually do not forget to put everything 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.070
 Like if wants new videos to new 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.070
 meeting 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:47.439
 this
