00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.039
 hello to all of us we are 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.650
 found for a new video and so 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.330
 I'm going to make a video this time on 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.020
 the layout of a terrarium for 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.810
 speed pogonat is this so juvenile or 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:31.129
 subadult but not his adult size 1 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:36.239
 because it's small enough so that's it 

00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:40.410
 So already, the sterile sand we buy 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:43.620
 in pet shop so me it's the past of the 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.059
 red desert sand trip six shots of 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.400
 exo terrain it works very well 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.440
 it's like that it cost me 13 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.489
 so what do these researchers from the 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.290
 sand I agree 4 kg 5 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:01:00.479
 so here you have to know that the 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:02.940
 pogos navy ti zef are reptiles 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:04.440
 put in basel and arboreal it means 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.549
 that they need to have a point but 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.439
 we can say a branch 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:13.010
 I took to the disinfected branch level 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.860
 clean 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.510
 here she is like that here no 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.660
 places since that's okay that's it 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:25.600
 when excuse me and my darling who is 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:30.680
 going away I hand it over 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:35.390
 So that's the same auch city hall 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:37.160
 high point so then and 20 for 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.450
 aesthetics a stone so me it's 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.380
 a big stone of ropes breast she 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.750
 is super rebel found in nature 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.220
 clean disinfect not forgotten 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.620
 clean disinfect the stones because 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.950
 that they can develop 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:55.340
 bacteria and all and all that is dirty 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:02:00.140
 and stone in nature when I did 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:02.540
 but there because it is an animal 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.160
 desert but climbing on 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.240
 dry branches and all that is in the 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:11.120
 desert so here it lives in australia 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:14.540
 the noble pogos finally I will make a video 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:19.700
 on it for the breeding sheet of the 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:21.350
 togo did well to deal with this 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.180
 to give him something to eat 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.480
 must be avoided 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:29.860
 so here's a tile because the point 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:34.190
 hot it will be here here will have hot spot 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:36.850
 here oral cold points like that he she 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.350
 choose its temperature 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:44.959
 the tile in fact it is colored 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:48.800
 dark so it gets better finally that pulls 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:51.769
 better heat and that will make the effect of a 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.750
 heating mat for the evening like that 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.180
 can go there as I light will be 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.530
 off to go warm up then 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.209
 then she will sleep on her branch 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.680
 normally is that where she 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.680
 often sleeps because all the time 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:11.110
 then the plants so one like that 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:13.600
 exo field so it's expensive 9 12 oh 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.610
 that one is 2 euros that one 6,9 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:20.160
 euros 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:20.160
 so yeah even be here 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:36.950
 here I put the yellowed leaves of 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.680
 green games approach a little bit the 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:47.569
 stone like that game to put there 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:49.160
 leaves on it like that cannabis I 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:52.069
 do not know why these led lights make me 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.989
 think about that so that's how they are 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:59.360
 can they end she can hide 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:04:02.420
 behind so it's 1.60 out of 30 out of 30 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:05.510
 so it's good for a juvenile 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.690
 it's just for a subadult so that 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.670
 can go up to 2 juveniles 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.989
 these places anyway but hey after he 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.810
 must consider buying another 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.100
 terrarium to build one because 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.260
 it's really restricted 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.680
 it's impossible to raise a tax 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.400
 gonna dance is good is to extend to 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.510
 because it's really too small 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:32.380
 then we put a second one 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:32.380
 here slips the rod 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.470
 me i g 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:52.319
 and the branch is here but the sleeve 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.689
 like that the sheet 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:59.620
 it gave me a little leaf 

00:04:55.689 --> 00:05:03.779
 like that here finally wall pieces 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.779
 vegetable that makes it good 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:16.469
 I could have of course the suckers are 

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:16.469
 good of her like that 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:27.460
 the bowl where we put the vegetables that 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:28.750
 I would put it in fact it may be 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:35.289
 a little lie I'll take one more 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:39.250
 little this one this one which is more 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:41.050
 little 1 so we put it in a close corner 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:46.020
 water anyway in the cold zone 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:49.120
 because we must not put water and 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:51.250
 the fruits and vegetables of the bo gonna in 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.289
 the hot zone because the bacteria 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.669
 will grow faster in the water and 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:56.409
 especially since it's not nice to 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:06:00.490
 lukewarm water fresh water it's 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:06:05.979
 much more pleasant so here it is necessary 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:06.550
 sprinkle with either calcium intake 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:08.439
 nutrient 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:12.310
 so that's a nutritious before so 

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:14.770
 for those who know it's great 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.810
 effective because there is really forget about 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.699
 vitamin d3 and all and the contributions 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.719
 nutritious and just misses calcium and 

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:21.939
 there would be everything needed 

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:24.580
 teeth so because there are some 

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:26.500
 buy special boxes with 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.139
 determines three mails to the 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.759
 vitamin d3 is already in me no 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:32.919
 but these first do not see there is already 

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:35.889
 of vitamin d3 in that it's used to 

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:39.599
 nothing to buy so we sprinkle everything 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:42.460
 that and that's a beautiful terrarium 

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:42.789
 why so I go there I'm going to 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.779
 to put 

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:45.779
 here 

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.590
 in his burrow 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:58.640
 so that looks pretty much what is 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:07:00.740
 for sale she is not shocked he has a 

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.510
 little disgusting at the end he cua 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.890
 it's an aquarium at the base because I 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.900
 found them out anyway so we 

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:11.690
 not all lucky to find a 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:14.110
 stuff like that sleeps he is well dirty 

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:14.110
 unknown 

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:25.990
 little video together 

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.120
 so here it was the dreamy harfangs 

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:37.159
 so for this video I have arranged a 

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:40.129
 field for programmable subadult and 

00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:43.720
 and juvenile so do not hesitate to like 

00:07:40.129 --> 00:07:46.520
