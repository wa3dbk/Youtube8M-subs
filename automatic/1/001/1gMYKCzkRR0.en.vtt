is<00:02:24.950> all<00:02:25.129> fabricated<00:02:25.670> out<00:02:25.970> of<00:02:26.150> tubing<00:02:26.540> all

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
is all fabricated out of tubing all

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.220 
is all fabricated out of tubing all
shaped<00:02:27.620> wrapped<00:02:28.340> around<00:02:28.519> and<00:02:28.909> pointed<00:02:29.269> around

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
shaped wrapped around and pointed around

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:38.309 
shaped wrapped around and pointed around
the<00:02:30.319> tops

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.030 

I<00:02:38.379> run<00:02:38.799> disk<00:02:39.640> brakes<00:02:40.590> majority<00:02:41.590> of<00:02:41.620> my<00:02:41.829> road

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
I run disk brakes majority of my road

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.190 
I run disk brakes majority of my road
bikes

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.059 

I<00:02:45.260> use<00:02:45.920> a<00:02:46.030> bullet<00:02:47.030> style<00:02:47.330> tap<00:02:47.780> that<00:02:48.590> actually

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
I use a bullet style tap that actually

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.580 
I use a bullet style tap that actually
rotates

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.920 

my<00:02:52.129> disk<00:02:52.370> brake<00:02:52.610> tap<00:02:52.879> actually<00:02:53.510> comes<00:02:53.750> up

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
my disk brake tap actually comes up

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.759 
my disk brake tap actually comes up
around<00:02:54.200> the<00:02:54.410> radius<00:02:55.030> of<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.360> fork<00:02:56.660> blade<00:02:56.930> to

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
around the radius of the fork blade to

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.339 
around the radius of the fork blade to
add<00:02:57.830> rigidity<00:02:58.489> for<00:02:59.120> running<00:02:59.810> the<00:02:59.840> disc<00:03:00.110> brakes

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
add rigidity for running the disc brakes

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:02.949 
add rigidity for running the disc brakes
for<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:00.620> extra<00:03:01.010> torque<00:03:01.420> that<00:03:02.420> you<00:03:02.569> get<00:03:02.750> with

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
for the extra torque that you get with

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.980 
for the extra torque that you get with
the<00:03:03.140> disc<00:03:03.590> brake<00:03:03.800> hub
