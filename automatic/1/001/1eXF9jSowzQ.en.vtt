and in this case we have added even more

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.139 
and in this case we have added even more
details<00:00:54.090> we<00:00:54.600> have<00:00:54.780> improved<00:00:55.380> the<00:00:55.530> blade<00:00:56.149> the

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
details we have improved the blade the

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.389 
details we have improved the blade the
the<00:00:57.630> size<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.230> little<00:00:58.350> bit<00:00:58.649> bigger<00:00:58.890> now<00:00:59.100> and

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
the size is a little bit bigger now and

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.729 
the size is a little bit bigger now and
the<00:01:00.210> firmness<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.870> little<00:01:01.170> bit<00:01:01.290> better<00:01:01.440> than

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
the firmness is a little bit better than

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.889 
the firmness is a little bit better than
before<00:01:01.829> we<00:01:02.700> should<00:01:02.880> probably<00:01:03.149> make<00:01:03.450> it<00:01:03.510> I

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
before we should probably make it I

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.860 
before we should probably make it I
would<00:01:04.649> say<00:01:04.829> hopefully<00:01:05.549> our<00:01:05.580> top<00:01:05.909> top<00:01:06.450> blade<00:01:06.659> of

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:06.870 
would say hopefully our top top blade of

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.570 
would say hopefully our top top blade of
the<00:01:06.900> cigna<00:01:07.260> coming<00:01:07.560> season<00:01:08.750> great<00:01:10.580> for

favorite<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.700> why<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:15.229> would<00:01:16.229> probably<00:01:16.409> say<00:01:16.650> a

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
favorite and why I would probably say a

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.830 
lightest tix yet available in these two
different<00:02:01.009> designs<00:02:02.270> that's<00:02:03.270> what<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.450> like<00:02:03.689> the

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
different designs that's what I like the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.320 
different designs that's what I like the
most

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
most

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.510 
most
and<00:02:04.750> if<00:02:04.870> you<00:02:04.960> compare<00:02:05.350> that<00:02:05.500> stick<00:02:05.800> to<00:02:06.130> to<00:02:06.490> a

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
and if you compare that stick to to a

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.749 
and if you compare that stick to to a
normal<00:02:06.760> player<00:02:07.440> for<00:02:08.440> example<00:02:08.890> how<00:02:09.130> light<00:02:09.399> is

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
normal player for example how light is

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.030

to<00:02:09.940> stick<00:02:10.230> well<00:02:11.230> actually<00:02:11.470> the<00:02:11.770> sticks

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
to stick well actually the sticks

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.310 
to stick well actually the sticks
nowadays<00:02:12.730> are<00:02:12.970> down<00:02:13.120> to<00:02:13.360> such<00:02:13.540> low<00:02:13.810> weight<00:02:14.050> so

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
nowadays are down to such low weight so

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.680 
nowadays are down to such low weight so
we're<00:02:14.470> just<00:02:14.500> talking<00:02:15.040> about<00:02:15.100> grams<00:02:15.690> they're

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
we're just talking about grams they're

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.780 
we're just talking about grams they're

yeah i just talked about the feather
light<00:05:07.789> solution<00:05:08.450> that<00:05:08.570> we<00:05:08.690> have<00:05:08.840> for<00:05:09.020> this

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
light solution that we have for this

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.600 
light solution that we have for this
year<00:05:09.320> which<00:05:09.470> is<00:05:09.500> very<00:05:09.800> big<00:05:10.010> for<00:05:10.039> us<00:05:10.250> and<00:05:10.520> have

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
year which is very big for us and have

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.070 
year which is very big for us and have
been<00:05:10.789> very<00:05:10.820> very<00:05:11.270> popular<00:05:11.510> during<00:05:11.870> the

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
been very very popular during the

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.529 
been very very popular during the
preseason<00:05:12.289> sales<00:05:12.919> and<00:05:13.669> another<00:05:14.180> thing<00:05:14.300> that

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:14.539 
preseason sales and another thing that

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:16.029 
preseason sales and another thing that
uni<00:05:14.780> hockey<00:05:14.930> started<00:05:15.380> within<00:05:15.560> were<00:05:15.830> at<00:05:15.949> least

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:16.039 
uni hockey started within were at least

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:17.680 
uni hockey started within were at least
of<00:05:16.220> course<00:05:16.400> the<00:05:16.639> curve<00:05:16.880> the<00:05:17.240> curved<00:05:17.510> shaft

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
of course the curve the curved shaft

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.310 
of course the curve the curved shaft
which<00:05:18.410> is<00:05:18.590> a<00:05:18.669> i<00:05:19.840> would<00:05:20.840> say<00:05:20.990> it<00:05:21.050> was<00:05:21.139> almost

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
which is a i would say it was almost

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.960 
which is a i would say it was almost
like<00:05:21.560> a<00:05:21.620> revolution<00:05:22.220> when<00:05:22.340> that<00:05:22.490> came<00:05:22.669> in<00:05:22.880> were

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
like a revolution when that came in were

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.300 
like a revolution when that came in were
having<00:05:23.000> a<00:05:23.270> large<00:05:23.510> percentage<00:05:23.720> of<00:05:24.080> clubs<00:05:24.650> with

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
having a large percentage of clubs with

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.610 
having a large percentage of clubs with
the<00:05:25.400> curve<00:05:25.580> chef<00:05:25.850> nowadays<00:05:26.300> the<00:05:27.229> obvious

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
the curve chef nowadays the obvious

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.740 
the curve chef nowadays the obvious
combination<00:05:28.250> would<00:05:28.370> be<00:05:28.550> to<00:05:28.760> make<00:05:28.940> something

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
combination would be to make something

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.950 
combination would be to make something
between<00:05:30.050> both<00:05:30.470> those<00:05:30.740> two<00:05:31.250> solutions<00:05:31.580> so<00:05:31.970> if

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
between both those two solutions so if

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.240 
between both those two solutions so if
you<00:05:33.080> want<00:05:33.260> something<00:05:33.440> really<00:05:33.770> light<00:05:33.950> with<00:05:34.220> a

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
you want something really light with a

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.219 
you want something really light with a
curve<00:05:34.550> I<00:05:34.880> think<00:05:35.419> you're<00:05:35.570> gonna<00:05:35.750> have<00:05:35.870> a<00:05:35.900> pretty

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:36.229 
curve I think you're gonna have a pretty

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:38.350 
curve I think you're gonna have a pretty
good<00:05:36.289> Christmas<00:05:36.590> this<00:05:36.950> year<00:05:37.240> then<00:05:38.240> we're
