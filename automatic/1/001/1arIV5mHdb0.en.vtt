new-school
as<00:00:12.599> you<00:00:13.349> can<00:00:13.469> see<00:00:13.620> on<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.860> bottom<00:00:14.070> compared<00:00:15.000> to

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
as you can see on the bottom compared to

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.609 
as you can see on the bottom compared to
the<00:00:15.179> top<00:00:15.389> there's<00:00:15.719> obvious<00:00:16.230> differences

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
the top there's obvious differences

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.070 
the top there's obvious differences
between<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:17.130> two<00:00:17.310> brushes<00:00:17.760> on<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.690> top<00:00:18.900> you

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
between the two brushes on the top you

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.779 
between the two brushes on the top you
see<00:00:19.109> there's<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.500> lot<00:00:19.680> of<00:00:19.830> rows<00:00:20.100> between<00:00:20.430> the

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
see there's a lot of rows between the

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.220 
see there's a lot of rows between the
bristles<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.480> on<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.750> bottom<00:00:22.080> you<00:00:22.199> can

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
bristles and on the bottom you can

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.710 
bristles and on the bottom you can
barely<00:00:22.680> see<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:22.980> bottom<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.580> just<00:00:24.570> know<00:00:24.689> that

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
barely see the bottom and just know that

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.220 
barely see the bottom and just know that
the<00:00:25.439> eight<00:00:25.650> one<00:00:25.890> one<00:00:25.920> nine<00:00:26.430> on<00:00:26.640> top<00:00:27.000> my<00:00:27.449> OG<00:00:27.990> has

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
the eight one one nine on top my OG has

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.890 
the eight one one nine on top my OG has
been<00:00:28.500> through<00:00:28.769> hell<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.070> back<00:00:29.449> that<00:00:30.449> brush<00:00:30.750> is

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
been through hell and back that brush is

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.780 
been through hell and back that brush is
probably<00:00:31.199> like<00:00:31.380> two<00:00:31.710> maybe<00:00:31.980> three<00:00:32.340> years<00:00:32.369> old

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
probably like two maybe three years old

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.090 
probably like two maybe three years old
and<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.780> still<00:00:34.170> looks<00:00:34.230> better<00:00:34.680> than<00:00:34.920> this

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
and it still looks better than this

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.299 
and it still looks better than this
new-school<00:00:35.520> Diane<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.329> have<00:00:36.660> here<00:00:36.989> on<00:00:37.920> the

new-school Diane that I have here on the

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.580 
new-school Diane that I have here on the
back<00:00:38.520> not<00:00:39.360> much<00:00:39.600> difference<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.320> just<00:00:40.500> a

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
back not much difference is just a

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.470 
back not much difference is just a
different<00:00:40.980> color<00:00:41.160> but<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.460> know<00:00:41.550> Diane's<00:00:42.120> have

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
different color but I know Diane's have

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.090 
different color but I know Diane's have
different<00:00:43.020> colors<00:00:43.350> when<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.590> comes<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.920> their

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
different colors when it comes to their

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.369 
different colors when it comes to their
brushes<00:00:47.480> all<00:00:48.480> right<00:00:48.629> here<00:00:48.870> we<00:00:48.989> have<00:00:49.170> the

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
brushes all right here we have the

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.590 
brushes all right here we have the
new-school<00:00:49.710> Diane<00:00:50.190> eight<00:00:50.399> one<00:00:50.640> one<00:00:50.879> nine<00:00:51.180> you

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
can barely see to the bottom of the

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.910 
can barely see to the bottom of the
brush<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.789> can't<00:00:54.000> see<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.300> back<00:00:54.480> on<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.500> sign

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
brush you can't see the back on the sign

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.709 
brush you can't see the back on the sign
to<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.309> right<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:56.670> can't<00:00:56.940> even<00:00:57.090> see<00:00:57.329> Diane

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
to the right you can't even see Diane

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.549 
to the right you can't even see Diane
properly<00:00:58.410> it's<00:00:58.559> faded<00:00:58.949> out<00:01:00.260> there's<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.289> lot<00:01:01.440> of

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
properly it's faded out there's a lot of

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.590 
properly it's faded out there's a lot of
space<00:01:01.770> between<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:04.070> on<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.250> bottom<00:01:05.700> where<00:01:06.510> it

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
space between the on the bottom where it

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.620 
space between the on the bottom where it
connects<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.200> bristles<00:01:07.700> whereas<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:09.150> og

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
connects to the bristles whereas the og

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.289 
connects to the bristles whereas the og
Dianne<00:01:10.020> right<00:01:10.350> here<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:11.610> bristles<00:01:12.030> go<00:01:12.119> all

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
Dianne right here the bristles go all

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.330 
Dianne right here the bristles go all
the<00:01:12.420> way<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.720> end<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.140> board<00:01:13.350> which

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
the way to the end of the board which

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.010 
the way to the end of the board which
means<00:01:14.610> they'll<00:01:14.850> probably<00:01:14.909> create<00:01:15.420> wider

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
means they'll probably create wider

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.920 
means they'll probably create wider
waves<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.560> could<00:01:16.710> say<00:01:17.390> you<00:01:18.390> can<00:01:18.540> see<00:01:18.720> through

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
waves you could say you can see through

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.399 
waves you could say you can see through
you<00:01:19.110> can<00:01:19.229> see<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.500> rows<00:01:20.630> Diane<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.930> labels<00:01:22.290> on

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
you can see the rows Diane the labels on

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.109 
you can see the rows Diane the labels on
the<00:01:22.500> right<00:01:22.710> side<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.369> label<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.090> still

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
the right side and this label is still

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.899 
the right side and this label is still
there<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:24.960> then<00:01:25.500> new-school<00:01:25.890> Diane<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.700> don't

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
there and then new-school Diane I don't

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.370 
there and then new-school Diane I don't
even<00:01:26.970> use<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.330> that's<00:01:27.659> fresh<00:01:27.900> up<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.170> box

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
even use that that's fresh up the box

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.590 
even use that that's fresh up the box
and<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.650> labels<00:01:28.979> already<00:01:29.280> gone<00:01:29.490> but<00:01:30.299> here<00:01:30.479> you

and the labels already gone but here you

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.450 
and the labels already gone but here you
can<00:01:30.780> see<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.290> og<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.950> right<00:01:32.189> right
