00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
much everything was out of our hands at

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.769

and<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:22.080> was<00:00:22.230> trying<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.529> slow<00:00:22.680> down<00:00:22.710> as<00:00:22.949> much<00:00:23.070> as

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
and I was trying to slow down as much as

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.340 
and I was trying to slow down as much as
I<00:00:23.279> could<00:00:23.340> but<00:00:23.699> it<00:00:24.330> looks<00:00:24.510> like<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.720> 96<00:00:25.199> got
