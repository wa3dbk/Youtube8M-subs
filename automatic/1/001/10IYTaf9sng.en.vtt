00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 hello to all guys and welcome back my 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.089
 channel 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.300
 today I will talk to you about resuming the speech 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.750
 of the other time of snipers in the del 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.280
 talk of sniper rifles here 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.880
 what a sniper available in 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.570
 battlefield 3 is basically in 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.939
 battlefield 3 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.680
 talking about sniper rifles at a 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.830
 single shot for each shot must 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:31.710
 recharge there are five jing 90 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:33.989
 sv 98 of the 96 lemme 98 bls points then 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.239
 among these five those who more than 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.680
 all hit me are the 90mm jing 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:44.610
 98 b because then the 98 b could say 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.360
 which is the best for one to hit 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.850
 they range from 420 or a medium distance 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.969
 because they are extremely lethal in that 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.070
 I intro this arc of distance and a lot 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.780
 often manages to kill the enemy too 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.809
 if he hits him in the head though if he does 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.080
 in short, hit the PC in the full 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:07.650
 it all fails as well though it has two 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.659
 the first defect is that it recharges every 500 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.420
 and the second that counters very much shippers 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.540
 small to the second and who 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:20.250
 after 300 400 meters it becomes 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:24.470
 practically interior as precise as 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:28.200
 it is in the middle and therefore loses because 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.000
 move away 9 at once that does not start 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.560
 however, the scene gets lost, however 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.009
 there is no distraction 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.310
 present it knows so it is not 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.750
 great from long distance while 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.630
 what great from the arms room of 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.039
 gip that the gene 90 that starting from 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.399
 assumption that it is a weapon that stands 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.270
 there are those inside the premium dl 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.250
 subscribe to the premium 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.090
 an exclusion this weapon yet others 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.100
 by the way it is this I add 90 things 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.799
 who really knows more from the media 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.909
 distance and a rifle like the others is 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:04.590
 balanced in the middle distance though 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:07.830
 the one where it really excels and from 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.649
 long distance because fish and 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.310
 very precise and almost always yes 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.099
 he says if he can't hit 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.280
 and the long distance is harmful because it has a 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:20.020
 very high stopping power 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.330
 and then I went by going to review the 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:28.420
 made that very soon that the weight of 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:31.240
 all from 400 meters onwards and so there is 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.690
 I practically founded what is the 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.970
 my ranking between the other gb to ten 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.700
 blows in the montali charger is a 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.260
 aspect favorable employment and from here 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.760
 I would also like to talk about a 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:50.560
 another aspect that maybe then or not less 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.180
 interesting and is that of con 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.440
 the shutter shutter that are gods 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.910
 accessories that you put the foci of 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.690
 precision a reality what the fuck they are 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:01.600
 then the biped and practically the 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.400
 tripod that is placed under the foci 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.470
 vision that at the time when Israel 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.840
 or stay on a flat surface 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.600
 group today and is stable so it doesn't tremble 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.630
 and therefore does not swing the viewfinder is indeed 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:16.180
 recommended or for inexperienced djoker like 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.060
 snipers that I will normally be fine with 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.150
 shift to keep locked hold on 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.310
 breath is more to order 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.700
 and that maybe they are not trained to do so 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:32.540
 or for those who may not be 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:34.400
 ships of the sniper, however, there is perhaps the 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.819
 like to use what we like on 3 the 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.189
 bigot and and maybe one 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.720
 contraindication good here because 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:44.000
 you practically don't have to take a breath 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:48.260
 because everything is already blocked 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.760
 the negative side that has first time 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.430
 that positioned or numbered 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.250
 he did think they thought 60 degrees later 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.370
 to change this view you must 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.720
 move out of cutter and maybe all 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.080
 the balls for whom 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.600
 in a frantic situation it might 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.470
 cost one 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:10.690
 who is killed for this maybe there is 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.870
 the shutter attraction that of course the 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.580
 fraction is practically not not you 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.600
 guarantees greater precision 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:22.240
 or greater stability, however, gives you 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.100
 practically every time 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.690
 reloads will not detach your viewfinder because 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.550
 every time you top up 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.060
 probably end a shot one behind 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.830
 the other 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.870
 but it is not that you shoot yourself with a thread of 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.640
 repeating precision but you always have to 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.410
 recharge though when recharging 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:39.130
 therefore they detach and will continue to see 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:41.590
 the target because mayor quickly 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.960
 lets us understand that this is for a 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.730
 troubadour for a born sniper 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.200
 this did not please anyone who does not have 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.300
 stability problems that is 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:56.700
 one is about to hold one's breath when 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:59.669
 must occupy and I believe it is so 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:02.980
 referred also subject is however 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:05.050
 sniper this must be said then 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.540
 the over it happens there would be neither 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.860
 just nothing else as a leader and therefore 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.530
 it would not even be nice to know you 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:14.200
 what you use if you think fit and 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.470
 b places or if you have any other 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.070
 accessory 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:21.440
 used in place of these maybe 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:24.710
 example which viewfinder you are 8 x 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:27.020
 12 x there are several around me 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.690
 honestly I always try to use that 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:32.540
 garden for why she doesn't give you a 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:37.460
 wants not too much magnified targets 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:39.350
 of things so it goes pretty well and wi 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.210
 I would like to know how you love 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.490
 it would have been this video above all 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:46.670
 if so which ones are yours 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:48.170
 sniper rifles you prefer and 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:52.740
 accessories such as self- assembled 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:55.139
 maybe it may also be that I don't know 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:58.770
 the paintings revalue for those who, however, the 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:06:00.720
 98 lele 96 ls movie have been released a 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.370
 snipers we could say just follow the 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:07.020
 sworn but not particular 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:11.000
 dowries and with this I leave you and if for you 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.000
 in a video, everyone likes to leave
