having<00:00:30.480> me<00:00:30.539> on<00:00:30.570> again<00:00:30.839> historically<00:00:31.320> rising

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:32.129 
having me on again historically rising

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:34.490 
having me on again historically rising
rates<00:00:32.339> equals<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:33.000> recovering<00:00:33.629> economy<00:00:33.839> why<00:00:34.440> is

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
rates equals a recovering economy why is

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.410 
rates equals a recovering economy why is
it<00:00:34.710> different<00:00:34.860> this<00:00:35.070> time<00:00:35.129> around<00:00:35.400> well<00:00:36.089> also

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
it different this time around well also

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.819 
it different this time around well also
rising<00:00:36.900> rates<00:00:37.110> could<00:00:37.350> be<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.530> sign<00:00:37.800> of

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
rising rates could be a sign of

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.470 
rising rates could be a sign of
inflation<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.579> think<00:00:38.790> that's<00:00:38.970> what<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.269> have

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
inflation I think that's what you have

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.240 
inflation I think that's what you have
here<00:00:39.870> remember<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.409> only<00:00:40.530> reason<00:00:41.010> that<00:00:41.159> it

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
here remember the only reason that it

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.920 
here remember the only reason that it
looks<00:00:41.430> like<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.790> economy<00:00:42.239> is<00:00:42.360> growing<00:00:42.540> is

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
looks like the economy is growing is

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.719 
looks like the economy is growing is
because<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.710> Federal<00:00:43.979> Reserve<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.339> creating

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:44.729 
because the Federal Reserve is creating

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:46.880 
because the Federal Reserve is creating
a<00:00:44.790> lot<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:44.970> inflation<00:00:45.659> to<00:00:46.019> artificially<00:00:46.650> prop

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
a lot of inflation to artificially prop

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.530 
a lot of inflation to artificially prop
up<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.190> gdp<00:00:47.369> and<00:00:47.909> I<00:00:48.180> think<00:00:48.360> it's<00:00:48.479> that

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
up the gdp and I think it's that

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.600 
up the gdp and I think it's that
inflation<00:00:49.229> and<00:00:49.409> inflation<00:00:49.610> expectations

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
inflation and inflation expectations

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.430 
inflation and inflation expectations
that<00:00:51.030> explains<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.600> back<00:00:51.780> up<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.140> interest

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
that explains the back up and interest

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.200 
that explains the back up and interest
rates<00:00:52.650> and<00:00:52.799> not<00:00:53.189> in<00:00:53.339> the<00:00:53.369> positive<00:00:53.699> outlook

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
rates and not in the positive outlook

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.630 
rates and not in the positive outlook
for<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.420> economy<00:00:54.619> so<00:00:55.619> Peter<00:00:55.949> it's<00:00:56.129> Karen<00:00:56.460> if

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
for the economy so Peter it's Karen if

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.450 
for the economy so Peter it's Karen if
gdp<00:00:57.330> gdp<00:00:57.739> seeming<00:00:58.739> growth<00:00:58.949> is<00:00:59.189> really<00:00:59.430> a

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
gdp gdp seeming growth is really a

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.299 
gdp gdp seeming growth is really a
mirage<00:00:59.820> then<00:01:00.510> an<00:01:01.140> inflation<00:01:01.769> isn't<00:01:02.070> really

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
mirage then an inflation isn't really

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.130 
mirage then an inflation isn't really
there<00:01:02.549> could<00:01:02.909> it<00:01:03.000> be<00:01:03.119> a<00:01:03.150> widening<00:01:03.540> of<00:01:03.689> credit

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
there could it be a widening of credit

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.750 
there could it be a widening of credit
spreads<00:01:04.470> it's<00:01:04.650> actually<00:01:05.100> in<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.339> long<00:01:05.519> end

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
spreads it's actually in the long end

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.700 
spreads it's actually in the long end
well<00:01:06.000> inflation<00:01:06.689> isn't<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.049> mirage<00:01:07.320> that's

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
well inflation isn't the mirage that's

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.580 
well inflation isn't the mirage that's
actually<00:01:08.250> here<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.759> so<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.479> GDP<00:01:10.020> doesn't

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
actually here and so the GDP doesn't

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.460 
actually here and so the GDP doesn't
perform<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:11.460> know<00:01:11.490> GDP<00:01:11.909> growth<00:01:12.540> isn't<00:01:12.870> really

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
perform you know GDP growth isn't really

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.920 
perform you know GDP growth isn't really
there<00:01:13.740> yeah<00:01:14.730> you<00:01:14.910> can<00:01:15.120> you<00:01:15.270> can<00:01:15.480> still<00:01:15.750> have

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
there yeah you can you can still have

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.750 
there yeah you can you can still have
inflation<00:01:16.380> with<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.740> weak<00:01:16.950> economy<00:01:17.250> in<00:01:17.550> fact

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 
inflation with a weak economy in fact

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.580 
inflation with a weak economy in fact
the<00:01:17.910> weaker<00:01:18.210> economy<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.170> worst<00:01:19.380> the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
the weaker economy the worst the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.260 
the weaker economy the worst the
inflation<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.160> going<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.340> get<00:01:20.520> because<00:01:21.000> the

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
inflation is going to get because the

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.750 
inflation is going to get because the
Fed<00:01:21.510> fights<00:01:21.930> off<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.230> economic<00:01:22.950> weakness<00:01:23.130> by

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
Fed fights off the economic weakness by

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.330 
Fed fights off the economic weakness by
creating<00:01:24.270> inflation<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.380> in<00:01:25.980> in<00:01:26.220> the

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
creating inflation and so in in the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.040 
creating inflation and so in in the
worst<00:01:26.580> inflation's<00:01:27.300> that<00:01:27.450> have<00:01:27.570> broken<00:01:27.810> out

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
worst inflation's that have broken out

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.990 
worst inflation's that have broken out
historically<00:01:28.620> they<00:01:29.070> happened<00:01:29.490> in<00:01:29.550> very<00:01:29.730> weak

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
historically they happened in very weak

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.520 
historically they happened in very weak
economies<00:01:30.570> with<00:01:30.870> high<00:01:31.050> levels<00:01:31.080> of

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
economies with high levels of

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.649 
economies with high levels of
unemployment<00:01:32.120> so<00:01:33.120> you're<00:01:33.270> looking<00:01:33.390> for

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
unemployment so you're looking for

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.690 
unemployment so you're looking for
stagflation<00:01:34.100> yes<00:01:35.100> but<00:01:35.310> with<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.460> lot<00:01:35.670> of

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
stagflation yes but with a lot of

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.800 
stagflation yes but with a lot of
flashing<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.420> lot<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.600> stagnation<00:01:37.130> okay

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
flashing and a lot of stagnation okay

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.870 
flashing and a lot of stagnation okay
any<00:01:39.810> chance<00:01:40.050> you<00:01:40.229> see<00:01:40.380> hyperinflation<00:01:40.880> yeah

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
any chance you see hyperinflation yeah

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.940 
any chance you see hyperinflation yeah
unfortunately<00:01:42.300> that<00:01:43.260> is<00:01:43.440> the<00:01:43.590> worst-case

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
unfortunately that is the worst-case

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.890 
unfortunately that is the worst-case
scenario<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.970> don't<00:01:45.300> know<00:01:45.390> how<00:01:45.510> to<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.870> know

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
scenario I don't know how to you know

it's<00:03:14.430> not<00:03:14.819> too<00:03:15.030> late<00:03:15.239> but<00:03:15.480> it's<00:03:15.510> going<00:03:15.750> to

it's not too late but it's going to

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.960 
it's not too late but it's going to
involve<00:03:16.079> some<00:03:16.260> tough<00:03:16.709> choices<00:03:17.010> and<00:03:17.250> Peter

involve some tough choices and Peter
Peter<00:03:18.299> you<00:03:18.359> understand<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:18.930> hyperinflation

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
Peter you understand the hyperinflation

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.259 
Peter you understand the hyperinflation
would<00:03:19.829> imply<00:03:20.129> an<00:03:20.340> inflation<00:03:20.819> rate<00:03:21.000> of<00:03:21.150> over

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
would imply an inflation rate of over

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.629 
would imply an inflation rate of over
fifty<00:03:21.750> percent<00:03:22.049> by<00:03:22.230> definition<00:03:22.680> well<00:03:23.489> it

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
fifty percent by definition well it

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:25.129 
fifty percent by definition well it
could<00:03:24.120> be<00:03:24.150> a<00:03:24.239> lot<00:03:24.419> higher<00:03:24.599> than<00:03:24.659> that<00:03:24.959> but<00:03:25.079> I

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
could be a lot higher than that but I

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.469 
could be a lot higher than that but I
said<00:03:25.319> it's<00:03:25.439> not<00:03:25.590> coming<00:03:25.889> in<00:03:26.069> 2010<00:03:26.879> but<00:03:27.359> it

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:27.479 
said it's not coming in 2010 but it

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:31.879 
said it's not coming in 2010 but it
might<00:03:27.629> come<00:03:27.930> in<00:03:27.959> 2012<00:03:28.949> 2013<00:03:29.790> 2014<00:03:30.780> if<00:03:31.290> we<00:03:31.769> don't

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
might come in 2012 2013 2014 if we don't

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:34.219 
might come in 2012 2013 2014 if we don't
take<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.400> correct<00:03:32.699> measures<00:03:33.239> today<00:03:33.540> but<00:03:33.959> so

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:34.229 
take the correct measures today but so

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:36.439 
take the correct measures today but so
far<00:03:34.560> we<00:03:35.010> are<00:03:35.159> marching<00:03:35.459> down<00:03:35.849> the<00:03:35.909> road<00:03:36.269> to

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:36.449 
far we are marching down the road to

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:38.420 
far we are marching down the road to
hyperinflation<00:03:36.810> because<00:03:37.769> we<00:03:37.919> are<00:03:38.040> pursuing

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
hyperinflation because we are pursuing

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.460 
hyperinflation because we are pursuing
the<00:03:38.699> very<00:03:38.970> policies<00:03:39.269> that<00:03:39.989> every<00:03:40.319> other

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
the very policies that every other

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.559 
the very policies that every other
nation<00:03:40.769> pursued<00:03:41.459> that<00:03:41.819> eventually<00:03:42.329> had

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
nation pursued that eventually had

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.629 
nation pursued that eventually had
hyperinflation<00:03:43.109> so<00:03:43.829> we<00:03:43.949> have<00:03:44.040> to<00:03:44.190> make<00:03:44.220> the

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
hyperinflation so we have to make the

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:46.610 
hyperinflation so we have to make the
tough<00:03:44.669> political<00:03:45.120> choices<00:03:45.659> to<00:03:46.260> shrink

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
tough political choices to shrink

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.439 
tough political choices to shrink
government<00:03:46.859> and<00:03:47.220> to<00:03:47.340> stop<00:03:47.609> the<00:03:47.819> spending<00:03:48.120> and

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
to stop the money printing before it's

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.339 
to stop the money printing before it's
too<00:03:50.699> late<00:03:50.729> to<00:03:51.269> make<00:03:51.419> those<00:03:51.629> decisions<00:03:51.930> well

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
too late to make those decisions well

what's<00:04:25.770> on<00:04:25.889> his<00:04:26.039> mind<00:04:26.099> he<00:04:26.460> doesn't<00:04:26.699> listen

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
what's on his mind he doesn't listen

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.520 
what's on his mind he doesn't listen
he's<00:04:27.120> on<00:04:27.300> a<00:04:27.330> bath<00:04:27.599> I<00:04:27.840> mean<00:04:27.960> he's<00:04:28.050> got<00:04:28.199> a<00:04:28.259> view

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
he's on a bath I mean he's got a view

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.260 
he's on a bath I mean he's got a view
and<00:04:28.680> he<00:04:28.740> sticks<00:04:29.009> to<00:04:29.099> it<00:04:29.310> good<00:04:29.460> for<00:04:29.639> him<00:04:29.820> yeah<00:04:30.150> I

and he sticks to it good for him yeah I

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.269 
and he sticks to it good for him yeah I
mean<00:04:30.419> he<00:04:30.719> can<00:04:30.900> be<00:04:31.110> somewhat<00:04:31.469> polarizing<00:04:32.190> at

00:04:32.269 --> 00:04:32.279 
mean he can be somewhat polarizing at

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:33.430 
mean he can be somewhat polarizing at
times<00:04:32.490> but<00:04:32.669> I<00:04:32.729> think<00:04:32.909> so

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
times but I think so

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.500 
times but I think so
like<00:04:33.620> here<00:04:33.830> on<00:04:33.950> this<00:04:34.100> desk<00:04:34.160> is<00:04:34.760> much<00:04:35.240> better

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
like here on this desk is much better

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.790 
like here on this desk is much better
than<00:04:35.600> it<00:04:35.780> used<00:04:35.930> to<00:04:36.050> be<00:04:38.050> off<00:04:39.050> side<00:04:39.380> of<00:04:39.500> Peters

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
than it used to be off side of Peters

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.770 
than it used to be off side of Peters
waters<00:04:40.250> right<00:04:40.820> let's<00:04:41.270> move<00:04:41.330> on<00:04:41.510> to<00:04:41.540> the<00:04:41.750> next
