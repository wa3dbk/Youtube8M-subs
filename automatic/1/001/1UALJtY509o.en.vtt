this<00:00:05.920> is<00:00:06.070> a<00:00:06.100> tutorial<00:00:06.550> on<00:00:06.850> solving

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:07.390 
this is a tutorial on solving

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.419 
this is a tutorial on solving
inequalities<00:00:08.230> by<00:00:08.410> multiplication<00:00:08.889> and

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:09.429 
inequalities by multiplication and

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:12.449 
inequalities by multiplication and
division<00:00:10.889> whenever<00:00:11.889> you<00:00:12.039> solve<00:00:12.280> an

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:12.459 
division whenever you solve an

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:14.520 
division whenever you solve an
inequality<00:00:12.700> for<00:00:13.329> a<00:00:13.360> variable<00:00:13.929> and<00:00:14.110> you're

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:14.530 
inequality for a variable and you're

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.049 
inequality for a variable and you're
multiplying<00:00:14.709> and<00:00:15.309> dividing<00:00:15.339> by<00:00:15.879> a<00:00:15.909> positive

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:16.059 
multiplying and dividing by a positive

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.859 
multiplying and dividing by a positive
number<00:00:17.189> all<00:00:18.189> of<00:00:18.519> the<00:00:18.640> same<00:00:18.849> rules<00:00:19.150> apply<00:00:19.300> as<00:00:19.539> if

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:19.869 
number all of the same rules apply as if

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:22.019 
number all of the same rules apply as if
this<00:00:20.050> was<00:00:20.289> an<00:00:20.410> equal<00:00:20.800> sign<00:00:21.009> or<00:00:21.369> these<00:00:21.789> were

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:22.029 
this was an equal sign or these were

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.560 
this was an equal sign or these were
equations<00:00:22.919> so<00:00:23.919> if<00:00:24.070> I<00:00:24.189> wanted<00:00:24.490> to<00:00:24.609> solve<00:00:24.789> 3x<00:00:25.179> is

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:25.570 
equations so if I wanted to solve 3x is

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.070 
equations so if I wanted to solve 3x is
less<00:00:25.779> than<00:00:25.960> 24<00:00:26.589> for<00:00:27.279> X<00:00:27.609> I<00:00:27.970> would<00:00:28.630> just<00:00:28.749> divide

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 
less than 24 for X I would just divide

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.760 
less than 24 for X I would just divide
both<00:00:29.320> sides<00:00:29.679> by<00:00:29.829> 3<00:00:30.339> and<00:00:30.749> I<00:00:31.749> would<00:00:31.900> get<00:00:32.050> X<00:00:32.320> is

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
both sides by 3 and I would get X is

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.740 
both sides by 3 and I would get X is
less<00:00:33.340> than<00:00:33.970> 8<00:00:35.100> if<00:00:36.100> I<00:00:36.310> have<00:00:36.460> X<00:00:36.700> divided<00:00:37.180> by<00:00:37.210> 4<00:00:37.600> is

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
less than 8 if I have X divided by 4 is

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.170 
less than 8 if I have X divided by 4 is
greater<00:00:37.930> than<00:00:38.140> or<00:00:38.290> equal<00:00:38.500> to<00:00:38.890> 2<00:00:39.130> and<00:00:39.430> I<00:00:39.820> wanted

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
greater than or equal to 2 and I wanted

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.810 
greater than or equal to 2 and I wanted
to<00:00:40.270> solve<00:00:40.510> for<00:00:40.720> X<00:00:40.930> I<00:00:41.290> could<00:00:42.070> multiply<00:00:42.400> both

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
to solve for X I could multiply both

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.440 
to solve for X I could multiply both
sides<00:00:43.180> by<00:00:43.330> 4<00:00:43.480> and<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:45.070> would<00:00:45.220> get<00:00:45.340> X<00:00:45.580> is<00:00:45.940> greater

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.450 
sides by 4 and I would get X is greater

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.770 
sides by 4 and I would get X is greater
than<00:00:46.720> or<00:00:46.900> equal<00:00:47.350> to<00:00:47.710> 8<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:49.270> whenever<00:00:49.450> you're

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
than or equal to 8 so whenever you're

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.810 
than or equal to 8 so whenever you're
solving<00:00:50.020> inequalities<00:00:50.920> and<00:00:51.160> you<00:00:51.310> multiply

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
solving inequalities and you multiply

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.240 
solving inequalities and you multiply
and<00:00:51.970> divide<00:00:52.240> by<00:00:52.420> a<00:00:52.450> positive<00:00:52.750> number<00:00:53.110> all<00:00:53.740> of

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
and divide by a positive number all of

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.820 
and divide by a positive number all of
the<00:00:54.370> same<00:00:54.610> rules<00:00:54.910> apply<00:00:55.090> as<00:00:55.600> if<00:00:56.230> this<00:00:56.470> was<00:00:56.710> an

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:56.830 
the same rules apply as if this was an

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.430 
the same rules apply as if this was an
equation<00:00:57.220> where<00:00:57.880> you<00:00:58.120> had<00:00:58.300> an<00:00:58.390> equal<00:00:58.870> sign<00:00:59.110> on

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
equation where you had an equal sign on

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.040 
equation where you had an equal sign on
either<00:00:59.950> side<00:01:00.310> of<00:01:00.550> your<00:01:01.120> expression<00:01:01.660> whenever

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
either side of your expression whenever

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.900 
either side of your expression whenever
you<00:01:02.260> solve<00:01:02.560> an<00:01:02.710> inequality<00:01:02.950> with

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
you solve an inequality with

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.150 
you solve an inequality with
multiplication<00:01:04.330> and<00:01:04.720> division<00:01:05.199> and<00:01:05.410> you

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.160 
multiplication and division and you

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.750 
multiplication and division and you
multiply<00:01:06.730> or<00:01:06.940> divide<00:01:07.000> by<00:01:07.450> a<00:01:07.660> negative<00:01:07.990> number

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
multiply or divide by a negative number

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.010 
multiply or divide by a negative number
things<00:01:09.760> are<00:01:09.940> a<00:01:09.970> little<00:01:10.150> bit<00:01:10.360> different<00:01:10.810> here

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
things are a little bit different here

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.310 
things are a little bit different here
we<00:01:12.010> have<00:01:12.130> negative<00:01:12.400> 2x<00:01:12.790> is<00:01:13.210> greater<00:01:13.390> than<00:01:13.750> 16

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
we have negative 2x is greater than 16

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.220 
we have negative 2x is greater than 16
our<00:01:15.100> first<00:01:15.490> step<00:01:15.760> would<00:01:15.970> be<00:01:16.030> to<00:01:16.210> divide<00:01:16.900> both

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.230 
our first step would be to divide both

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.940 
our first step would be to divide both
sides<00:01:17.590> by<00:01:17.800> negative<00:01:17.980> 2<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:20.380> we<00:01:20.500> would<00:01:20.680> get<00:01:20.770> X

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
sides by negative 2 and we would get X

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.990 
sides by negative 2 and we would get X
is<00:01:21.400> greater<00:01:21.670> than<00:01:22.210> negative<00:01:22.810> 8<00:01:23.820> but<00:01:24.820> whenever

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
is greater than negative 8 but whenever

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.700 
is greater than negative 8 but whenever
you<00:01:25.300> multiply<00:01:25.810> or<00:01:25.870> divide<00:01:25.990> by<00:01:26.350> a<00:01:26.380> negative

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
you multiply or divide by a negative

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.320 
you multiply or divide by a negative
number<00:01:26.980> you<00:01:27.550> have<00:01:28.480> to<00:01:28.750> switch<00:01:29.080> your

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
number you have to switch your

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.110 
number you have to switch your
inequality<00:01:31.330> sign<00:01:32.070> so<00:01:33.070> our<00:01:33.250> actual<00:01:33.640> answer

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
inequality sign so our actual answer

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.600 
inequality sign so our actual answer
then<00:01:34.300> would<00:01:34.659> be<00:01:34.840> X<00:01:35.080> is<00:01:35.470> less<00:01:35.890> than<00:01:36.250> negative<00:01:36.909> 8

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
then would be X is less than negative 8

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.210 
then would be X is less than negative 8
if<00:01:39.610> we<00:01:40.390> have<00:01:40.510> X<00:01:40.780> divided<00:01:41.290> by<00:01:41.320> negative<00:01:41.620> 2<00:01:42.010> is

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
if we have X divided by negative 2 is

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.820 
if we have X divided by negative 2 is
less<00:01:42.490> than<00:01:42.550> 8<00:01:42.970> and<00:01:43.240> we<00:01:43.630> multiply<00:01:43.900> both<00:01:44.470> sides

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
less than 8 and we multiply both sides

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.430 
less than 8 and we multiply both sides
by<00:01:45.190> negative<00:01:45.370> 2<00:01:46.000> because<00:01:46.840> we're<00:01:47.049> solving<00:01:47.229> for

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
by negative 2 because we're solving for

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.670 
by negative 2 because we're solving for
x<00:01:47.770> we<00:01:48.100> would<00:01:48.880> get<00:01:49.000> X<00:01:49.180> is<00:01:49.600> less<00:01:49.810> than<00:01:50.200> negative

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
x we would get X is less than negative

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.520 
x we would get X is less than negative
16<00:01:51.460> but<00:01:52.299> we<00:01:52.420> multiplied<00:01:53.020> by<00:01:53.229> a<00:01:53.260> negative

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
16 but we multiplied by a negative

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.899 
16 but we multiplied by a negative
number<00:01:54.100> which<00:01:54.880> means<00:01:55.060> we<00:01:55.299> have<00:01:55.600> to<00:01:55.870> switch<00:01:56.200> our

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
number which means we have to switch our

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.870 
number which means we have to switch our
inequality<00:01:57.909> sign<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.130> opposite<00:02:00.520> of<00:02:00.640> less

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
inequality sign so the opposite of less

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.520 
inequality sign so the opposite of less
than<00:02:00.909> would<00:02:01.360> be<00:02:01.390> greater<00:02:01.750> than<00:02:01.990> and<00:02:02.260> we'd<00:02:02.380> have

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
than would be greater than and we'd have

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.879 
than would be greater than and we'd have
X<00:02:02.799> has<00:02:03.700> to<00:02:03.909> be<00:02:03.940> greater<00:02:04.450> than<00:02:04.570> negative<00:02:05.640> 16<00:02:07.889> so

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:08.889 
X has to be greater than negative 16 so

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:10.800 
X has to be greater than negative 16 so
why<00:02:09.129> do<00:02:09.189> we<00:02:09.340> reverse<00:02:09.729> the<00:02:09.969> inequality<00:02:10.149> sign

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
why do we reverse the inequality sign

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.390 
why do we reverse the inequality sign
when<00:02:11.079> we<00:02:11.139> multiply<00:02:11.739> and<00:02:11.859> divide<00:02:12.129> by<00:02:12.370> a

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
when we multiply and divide by a

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.290 
when we multiply and divide by a
negative<00:02:12.670> number

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
negative number

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.260 
negative number
well<00:02:14.290> let's<00:02:14.410> look<00:02:14.590> at<00:02:14.710> this<00:02:14.800> example<00:02:15.040> here<00:02:15.610> we

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
well let's look at this example here we

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.660 
well let's look at this example here we
have<00:02:16.300> negative<00:02:16.810> 3<00:02:17.020> X<00:02:17.200> has<00:02:17.500> to<00:02:17.650> be<00:02:17.680> less<00:02:18.040> than<00:02:18.070> 9

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
have negative 3 X has to be less than 9

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.090 
have negative 3 X has to be less than 9
if<00:02:19.600> I<00:02:19.840> divide<00:02:20.170> both<00:02:20.200> sides<00:02:20.800> by<00:02:21.010> negative<00:02:21.220> 3<00:02:22.000> I

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
if I divide both sides by negative 3 I

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.520 
if I divide both sides by negative 3 I
get<00:02:24.100> X<00:02:24.370> is<00:02:24.760> less<00:02:25.240> than<00:02:25.270> negative<00:02:25.750> 3

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
get X is less than negative 3

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.160 
get X is less than negative 3
now<00:02:27.340> I<00:02:27.370> haven't<00:02:27.760> switched<00:02:28.240> my<00:02:28.480> inequality

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
now I haven't switched my inequality

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.470 
now I haven't switched my inequality
sign<00:02:29.440> yet<00:02:29.740> and<00:02:29.980> let's<00:02:30.700> see<00:02:30.880> what<00:02:31.030> happens<00:02:31.330> if

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
sign yet and let's see what happens if

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.530 
sign yet and let's see what happens if
we<00:02:31.540> don't<00:02:31.900> switch<00:02:32.410> our<00:02:32.590> inequality<00:02:33.250> sign

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
we don't switch our inequality sign

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.820 
we don't switch our inequality sign
let's<00:02:34.540> pick<00:02:34.810> a<00:02:34.840> number<00:02:35.290> that's<00:02:35.440> less<00:02:35.800> than

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
let's pick a number that's less than

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:36.960 
let's pick a number that's less than
negative<00:02:36.220> 3

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
negative 3

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.240 
negative 3
and<00:02:37.090> plug<00:02:37.720> it<00:02:37.900> back<00:02:37.930> into<00:02:38.440> this<00:02:38.710> original

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
and plug it back into this original

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.570 
and plug it back into this original
equation<00:02:40.050> let's<00:02:41.050> pick<00:02:41.350> X<00:02:41.680> is<00:02:42.220> equal<00:02:42.550> to

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
equation let's pick X is equal to

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.910 
equation let's pick X is equal to
negative<00:02:42.940> 4<00:02:43.510> because<00:02:43.840> negative<00:02:44.440> 4<00:02:44.710> is<00:02:44.890> less

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
negative 4 because negative 4 is less

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.030 
negative 4 because negative 4 is less
than<00:02:45.400> negative<00:02:45.580> 3<00:02:46.050> and<00:02:47.050> we'll<00:02:47.230> plug<00:02:47.500> this<00:02:47.710> back

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
than negative 3 and we'll plug this back

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.850 
than negative 3 and we'll plug this back
into<00:02:48.280> our<00:02:48.400> equation<00:02:48.840> if<00:02:49.840> we<00:02:49.930> do<00:02:50.290> that<00:02:50.500> we'll

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
into our equation if we do that we'll

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.520 
into our equation if we do that we'll
have<00:02:50.980> negative<00:02:51.280> 3<00:02:51.850> times<00:02:52.140> X<00:02:53.140> which<00:02:53.500> is

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
have negative 3 times X which is

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.300 
have negative 3 times X which is
negative<00:02:53.890> 4<00:02:54.430> and<00:02:55.500> that<00:02:56.500> has<00:02:56.680> to<00:02:56.890> be<00:02:57.010> less<00:02:57.280> than

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
negative 4 and that has to be less than

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.540 
negative 4 and that has to be less than
9<00:02:58.020> now<00:02:59.020> if<00:02:59.170> I<00:02:59.230> multiply<00:02:59.710> negative<00:02:59.740> 3<00:03:00.310> times

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
9 now if I multiply negative 3 times

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.920 
9 now if I multiply negative 3 times
negative<00:03:00.730> 4<00:03:01.210> I<00:03:01.480> get<00:03:02.110> a<00:03:02.140> positive<00:03:02.680> 12<00:03:03.690> which<00:03:04.690> has

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
negative 4 I get a positive 12 which has

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.460 
negative 4 I get a positive 12 which has
to<00:03:05.080> be<00:03:05.110> less<00:03:05.230> than<00:03:05.680> 9<00:03:05.890> but<00:03:06.850> 12<00:03:07.180> is<00:03:07.390> not<00:03:07.690> less

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
to be less than 9 but 12 is not less

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.850 
to be less than 9 but 12 is not less
than<00:03:08.500> 9<00:03:09.270> so<00:03:10.270> that<00:03:10.300> is<00:03:10.630> why<00:03:10.840> we<00:03:11.140> always<00:03:11.350> switch

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
than 9 so that is why we always switch

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.070 
than 9 so that is why we always switch
our<00:03:12.070> inequality<00:03:12.730> sign<00:03:12.970> when<00:03:13.240> we<00:03:13.360> multiply<00:03:13.870> or

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
our inequality sign when we multiply or

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.310 
our inequality sign when we multiply or
divide<00:03:14.110> by<00:03:14.620> a<00:03:14.650> negative<00:03:14.770> number<00:03:15.520> so<00:03:16.140> now<00:03:17.140> let's

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
divide by a negative number so now let's

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.470 
divide by a negative number so now let's
see<00:03:17.470> how<00:03:17.590> we<00:03:17.650> can<00:03:17.860> apply<00:03:18.100> inequalities<00:03:19.030> in<00:03:19.390> a

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
see how we can apply inequalities in a

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.470 
see how we can apply inequalities in a
word<00:03:19.630> problem<00:03:20.010> here<00:03:21.010> we<00:03:21.130> have<00:03:21.280> Bob<00:03:21.520> is<00:03:21.760> $40<00:03:22.450> and

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
word problem here we have Bob is $40 and

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.780 
word problem here we have Bob is $40 and
wants<00:03:22.990> to<00:03:23.080> buy<00:03:23.260> a<00:03:23.290> movie<00:03:23.740> tickets<00:03:24.130> at<00:03:24.280> 8<00:03:24.520> bucks

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
wants to buy a movie tickets at 8 bucks

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:25.440 
wants to buy a movie tickets at 8 bucks
apiece

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
apiece

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.040 
apiece
how<00:03:26.260> many<00:03:26.470> movie<00:03:26.740> tickets<00:03:27.070> can<00:03:27.250> Bob<00:03:27.459> buy<00:03:28.050> well

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
how many movie tickets can Bob buy well

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.230 
how many movie tickets can Bob buy well
first<00:03:29.290> let's<00:03:29.470> set<00:03:29.590> up<00:03:29.740> our<00:03:29.890> equation<00:03:30.400> we're

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
first let's set up our equation we're

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.699 
first let's set up our equation we're
going<00:03:31.270> to<00:03:31.420> call<00:03:31.630> the<00:03:31.780> number<00:03:32.200> of<00:03:32.350> movie

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
going to call the number of movie

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.320 
going to call the number of movie
tickets<00:03:32.920> X<00:03:34.380> so<00:03:35.380> the<00:03:35.530> total<00:03:35.770> cost<00:03:36.160> for<00:03:36.370> the

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
tickets X so the total cost for the

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.970 
tickets X so the total cost for the
amount<00:03:37.600> of<00:03:37.660> movie<00:03:37.959> tickets<00:03:38.110> that<00:03:38.440> Bob<00:03:38.620> buys

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
amount of movie tickets that Bob buys

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.560 
amount of movie tickets that Bob buys
would<00:03:39.940> be<00:03:40.090> $8<00:03:40.870> times<00:03:41.350> X<00:03:41.940> and<00:03:42.940> Bob<00:03:43.240> has<00:03:43.540> a

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
would be $8 times X and Bob has a

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
would be $8 times X and Bob has a
maximum<00:03:44.410> of<00:03:44.560> 40<00:03:45.040> dollars<00:03:45.370> to<00:03:45.550> spend<00:03:46.050> so<00:03:47.050> the

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
maximum of 40 dollars to spend so the

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.610 
maximum of 40 dollars to spend so the
cost<00:03:47.830> of<00:03:48.010> the<00:03:48.130> movie<00:03:48.430> tickets<00:03:48.790> or<00:03:48.970> 8<00:03:49.300> X<00:03:49.630> has<00:03:50.380> to

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
cost of the movie tickets or 8 X has to

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:57.900 
cost of the movie tickets or 8 X has to
be<00:03:50.650> less<00:03:50.770> than<00:03:51.340> or<00:03:51.580> equal<00:03:52.270> to<00:03:53.490> $40<00:03:56.490> so<00:03:57.490> to<00:03:57.670> solve

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
be less than or equal to $40 so to solve

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.210 
be less than or equal to $40 so to solve
for<00:03:58.090> X<00:03:58.300> or<00:03:58.630> the<00:03:58.870> number<00:03:59.620> of<00:03:59.770> movie<00:04:00.040> tickets

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
for X or the number of movie tickets

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.620 
for X or the number of movie tickets
that<00:04:00.550> Bob<00:04:00.730> buys<00:04:01.140> we<00:04:02.140> divide<00:04:02.410> both<00:04:02.650> sides<00:04:02.980> by<00:04:03.190> 8

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
that Bob buys we divide both sides by 8

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.750 
that Bob buys we divide both sides by 8
and<00:04:04.630> we'll<00:04:04.780> get<00:04:04.900> X<00:04:05.170> has<00:04:05.590> to<00:04:05.770> be<00:04:05.830> less<00:04:05.950> than<00:04:06.550> or

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
and we'll get X has to be less than or

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.620 
and we'll get X has to be less than or
equal<00:04:07.120> to<00:04:07.300> 5

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
equal to 5

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:15.449 
equal to 5
so<00:04:10.630> Bob<00:04:10.930> can<00:04:11.230> buy<00:04:11.410> at<00:04:11.709> maximum<00:04:13.980> 5<00:04:14.980> movie

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
so Bob can buy at maximum 5 movie

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.090 
so Bob can buy at maximum 5 movie
tickets<00:04:15.820> and<00:04:16.380> that<00:04:17.380> completes<00:04:17.799> the<00:04:17.950> tutorial

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
tickets and that completes the tutorial

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.130
