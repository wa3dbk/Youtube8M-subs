00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
hello Erica this is Lucas genic and the

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.289 
hello Erica this is Lucas genic and the
Damien<00:00:03.480> and<00:00:04.549> we're<00:00:05.549> making<00:00:05.819> this<00:00:05.940> video<00:00:06.240> for

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
Damien and we're making this video for

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.910 
Damien and we're making this video for
you<00:00:06.569> so<00:00:07.519> the<00:00:08.519> robot<00:00:08.760> can<00:00:08.970> move<00:00:09.889> faster<00:00:10.889> than

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
you so the robot can move faster than

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.339 
you so the robot can move faster than
that<00:00:11.250> that's<00:00:11.490> picture<00:00:11.849> right<00:00:12.000> now<00:00:12.200> and<00:00:13.200> like

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
that that's picture right now and like

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.880 
that that's picture right now and like
you<00:00:13.469> said<00:00:13.650> this<00:00:13.799> was<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.040> 10%<00:00:14.940> right<00:00:15.150> now<00:00:15.360> and

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:15.890 
you said this was a 10% right now and

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.859 
you said this was a 10% right now and
actually<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.670> current<00:00:17.850> configuration<00:00:18.240> they

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
actually the current configuration they

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.990 
actually the current configuration they
have<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:19.140> configured<00:00:19.439> so<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.160> I<00:00:20.580> can<00:00:20.760> change

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
have it configured so and I can change

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.609 
have it configured so and I can change
it<00:00:21.240> so<00:00:21.800> the<00:00:22.800> jog<00:00:23.100> it's<00:00:23.460> actually<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:24.470> 100%<00:00:25.470> job

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
it so the jog it's actually a 100% job

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.939 
it so the jog it's actually a 100% job
that's<00:00:25.890> actually<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.279> 10%<00:00:27.000> of<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.619> of<00:00:28.619> the

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
that's actually a 10% of the of the

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.930 
that's actually a 10% of the of the
maximum<00:00:29.640> movement<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.330> I<00:00:31.399> had<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.610> cranked

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
maximum movement and I had the cranked

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.790 
maximum movement and I had the cranked
up<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.059> 30%<00:00:33.450> I'm<00:00:33.930> gonna<00:00:34.110> crank<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.469> up<00:00:34.530> even

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
up to 30% I'm gonna crank it up even

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.240 
up to 30% I'm gonna crank it up even
higher<00:00:34.829> right<00:00:35.340> now<00:00:36.079> but<00:00:37.079> what<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.380> had<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.710> do<00:00:37.890> I

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
higher right now but what I had to do I

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.350 
higher right now but what I had to do I
had<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:39.420> had<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.559> bolt<00:00:41.219> some<00:00:41.579> holes<00:00:41.850> in<00:00:42.239> the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
had to I had to bolt some holes in the

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.600 
had to I had to bolt some holes in the
ground<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.840> just<00:00:43.620> bolt<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:43.920> down<00:00:43.980> because<00:00:44.340> at

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
ground and just bolt it down because at

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.700 
ground and just bolt it down because at
30%<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.329> started<00:00:45.690> wobbling<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:48.649> we<00:00:49.649> were

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
30% it started wobbling and we were

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.350 
30% it started wobbling and we were
afraid<00:00:49.950> it's<00:00:50.219> gonna<00:00:50.399> tip<00:00:50.579> over<00:00:50.760> or<00:00:50.879> something

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
afraid it's gonna tip over or something

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.600 
afraid it's gonna tip over or something
so<00:00:51.600> we<00:00:52.410> just<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.710> know<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:52.860> bolted<00:00:53.219> down<00:00:53.399> on

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
so we just you know I bolted down on

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.150 
so we just you know I bolted down on
three<00:00:54.030> bolts<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.629> didn't<00:00:55.350> have<00:00:55.469> unfortunately

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
three bolts I didn't have unfortunately

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.849 
three bolts I didn't have unfortunately
the<00:00:56.370> fourth<00:00:56.610> bolt<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:58.440> didn't<00:00:58.649> want<00:00:58.800> to

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
the fourth bolt so and I didn't want to

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.029 
the fourth bolt so and I didn't want to
run<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.340> store<00:00:59.579> to<00:01:00.109> get<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.320> anchor<00:01:01.680> bolts

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
run to the store to get the anchor bolts

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.609 
run to the store to get the anchor bolts
but<00:01:02.340> we<00:01:02.789> have<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.940> three<00:01:03.359> point<00:01:03.600> bolted<00:01:04.049> down<00:01:04.229> so

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
but we have a three point bolted down so

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.140 
but we have a three point bolted down so
I<00:01:04.920> could<00:01:05.040> crank<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.489> up<00:01:05.549> pretty<00:01:05.790> high<00:01:05.939> we'll

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
I could crank it up pretty high we'll

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.020 
I could crank it up pretty high we'll
see<00:01:06.360> how<00:01:07.320> fast<00:01:07.500> it's<00:01:07.740> gonna<00:01:07.890> go<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.640> how

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
see how fast it's gonna go and how

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.060 
see how fast it's gonna go and how
wobbly<00:01:09.240> it's<00:01:09.450> gonna<00:01:09.630> get<00:01:09.810> on<00:01:10.080> those<00:01:10.799> three

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
wobbly it's gonna get on those three

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.130 
wobbly it's gonna get on those three
legs<00:01:11.220> but<00:01:11.369> this<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.760> right<00:01:11.909> now<00:01:12.060> at<00:01:12.210> 10%<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:13.020> I

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
legs but this is right now at 10% and I

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.890 
legs but this is right now at 10% and I
actually<00:01:13.650> programmed<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.840> actually<00:01:15.840> a

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
actually programmed I actually a

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.310 
actually programmed I actually a
programmed<00:01:17.780> automatic<00:01:18.780> movement<00:01:19.170> right<00:01:19.290> now

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
programmed automatic movement right now

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.520 
programmed automatic movement right now
so<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.610> thought<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.360> little<00:01:21.750> bit<00:01:22.020> small

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
so I thought it a little bit small

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.960 
so I thought it a little bit small
program<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.100> know<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.250> put<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.520> jump<00:01:24.530> jump<00:01:25.530> up

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
program you know I put a jump jump up

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.340 
program you know I put a jump jump up
routine<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.150> there<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:27.600> it's<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.259> know

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
routine in there so it's you know

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.210 
routine in there so it's you know
jumping<00:01:28.770> over<00:01:30.409> jumping<00:01:31.409> over<00:01:31.650> there<00:01:31.860> on<00:01:32.100> the

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
jumping over jumping over there on the

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.600 
jumping over jumping over there on the
end<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.579> program<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.210> first<00:01:33.450> line<00:01:33.720> so

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
end of the program to the first line so

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.649 
end of the program to the first line so
so<00:01:35.610> what<00:01:35.850> actually<00:01:36.659> does<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.140> in<00:01:37.259> circles<00:01:38.659> and

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
so what actually does it in circles and

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.749 
so what actually does it in circles and
I<00:01:39.960> have<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.140> limited<00:01:40.680> movement<00:01:41.130> here<00:01:41.369> so<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.610> you

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
I have a limited movement here so I you

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.569 
I have a limited movement here so I you
know<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.090> put<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.479> right<00:01:42.509> beside<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.320> wall<00:01:43.579> the

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
know I put it right beside the wall the

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.609 
know I put it right beside the wall the
movement<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.360> know<00:01:45.479> on<00:01:45.630> top<00:01:45.869> over<00:01:46.439> the

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
movement of it you know on top over the

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.499 
movement of it you know on top over the
over<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.280> wall<00:01:47.460> with<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.880> picture<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.329> has

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
over the wall with the picture it has

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.340 
over the wall with the picture it has
right<00:01:48.720> now

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
right now

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.410 
right now
and<00:01:51.010> it's<00:01:51.340> going<00:01:51.490> to<00:01:51.550> come<00:01:51.700> down<00:01:51.850> here<00:01:52.150> in<00:01:52.210> a

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
and it's going to come down here in a

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.080 
and it's going to come down here in a
second<00:01:53.760> it<00:01:54.760> should<00:01:54.970> be<00:01:55.810> doing<00:01:56.020> it<00:01:56.140> right<00:01:56.320> now

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
second it should be doing it right now

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.140 
second it should be doing it right now
and<00:01:58.090> I'm<00:01:58.210> just<00:01:58.420> gonna<00:01:58.570> put<00:01:58.990> over<00:01:59.470> a<00:02:00.060> little<00:02:01.060> bit

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
and I'm just gonna put over a little bit

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.820 
and I'm just gonna put over a little bit
more<00:02:01.390> so<00:02:01.600> you<00:02:01.630> can<00:02:01.840> see<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.440> whole<00:02:02.620> thing

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
more so you can see the the whole thing

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.740 
more so you can see the the whole thing
moving<00:02:03.660> and<00:02:04.660> this<00:02:04.840> is<00:02:04.990> a<00:02:05.020> 10%<00:02:05.850> right<00:02:06.850> now

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.320 

so<00:02:10.290> it's<00:02:10.440> like<00:02:10.560> our<00:02:10.680> the<00:02:10.950> fastest<00:02:11.610> jog<00:02:11.910> speed

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
so it's like our the fastest jog speed

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.380 
so it's like our the fastest jog speed
we<00:02:12.660> had<00:02:12.810> before<00:02:13.460> on<00:02:14.460> it<00:02:15.230> okay<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:17.240> it's<00:02:18.240> gonna

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
we had before on it okay and it's gonna

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.440 
we had before on it okay and it's gonna
execute<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:19.020> cycle<00:02:19.410> again<00:02:19.500> right<00:02:19.890> now<00:02:20.450> by

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
execute the cycle again right now by

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.870 
execute the cycle again right now by
itself<00:02:21.780> it's<00:02:22.230> in<00:02:22.350> outta<00:02:22.560> money<00:02:22.800> so<00:02:23.610> I'm<00:02:23.730> just

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
itself it's in outta money so I'm just

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.300 
itself it's in outta money so I'm just
gonna<00:02:24.030> grab<00:02:24.240> independent<00:02:25.020> right<00:02:25.170> now<00:02:28.310> and

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
gonna grab independent right now and

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.340 
gonna grab independent right now and
there's<00:02:30.120> our<00:02:30.300> pendant<00:02:30.750> right<00:02:30.990> here

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
there's our pendant right here

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.130 
there's our pendant right here
let's<00:02:31.740> see<00:02:32.250> right<00:02:32.520> we<00:02:33.240> have<00:02:33.390> joint<00:02:33.720> at<00:02:33.960> ten

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
let's see right we have joint at ten

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.960 
let's see right we have joint at ten
percent<00:02:34.560> right<00:02:34.860> now<00:02:34.920> at<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.280> moment<00:02:35.430> now<00:02:35.820> I'm

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
percent right now at the moment now I'm

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.040 
percent right now at the moment now I'm
just<00:02:36.180> gonna<00:02:36.360> press<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.560> shift<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:39.050> percent

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
just gonna press the shift and percent

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.550 
just gonna press the shift and percent
up<00:02:40.200> I<00:02:41.780> put<00:02:42.780> it<00:02:42.900> in<00:02:42.990> 20<00:02:43.380> percent<00:02:43.770> turn<00:02:44.310> 40<00:02:44.730> and

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
up I put it in 20 percent turn 40 and

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.810 
up I put it in 20 percent turn 40 and
right<00:02:46.560> now<00:02:46.680> this<00:02:46.860> is<00:02:47.010> running<00:02:47.340> at<00:02:47.400> 20<00:02:47.700> percent

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
right now this is running at 20 percent

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.550 
right now this is running at 20 percent
I'm<00:02:48.390> just<00:02:48.690> going<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:48.870> scoot<00:02:49.110> up<00:02:49.200> a<00:02:49.230> little<00:02:49.290> bit

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
I'm just going to scoot up a little bit

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.750 
I'm just going to scoot up a little bit
a<00:02:49.920> little<00:02:50.459> bit<00:02:50.610> more

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:06.500 

this<00:02:55.269> is<00:02:55.420> a<00:02:55.480> 10%<00:02:57.810> movement

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.699 

I<00:03:06.540> mean<00:03:07.200> this<00:03:07.290> is<00:03:07.409> a<00:03:07.470> 20%<00:03:08.129> of<00:03:08.250> them<00:03:08.430> work<00:03:08.610> sorry

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
I mean this is a 20% of them work sorry

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.140 
I mean this is a 20% of them work sorry
Eric<00:03:10.709> and<00:03:11.010> I'm<00:03:11.519> gonna<00:03:11.700> spit<00:03:12.060> it<00:03:12.150> up<00:03:12.269> from<00:03:12.599> 20%

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
Eric and I'm gonna spit it up from 20%

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.440 
Eric and I'm gonna spit it up from 20%
I'm<00:03:15.150> gonna<00:03:15.420> speed<00:03:15.720> up<00:03:15.750> to<00:03:16.140> let's<00:03:16.530> say<00:03:16.680> 30<00:03:17.450> but

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
I'm gonna speed up to let's say 30 but

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.520 
I'm gonna speed up to let's say 30 but
now<00:03:18.629> don't<00:03:19.319> shut<00:03:20.690> up

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
now don't shut up

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.330 
now don't shut up
right<00:03:24.190> now<00:03:24.340> I<00:03:24.370> have<00:03:24.490> 30%<00:03:24.970> joined<00:03:26.190> now<00:03:27.190> and

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
right now I have 30% joined now and

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.089 
right now I have 30% joined now and
that's<00:03:27.550> a<00:03:27.670> 2d

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:31.099 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:32.770 

and<00:03:31.579> at<00:03:31.730> this<00:03:31.849> point<00:03:32.090> it<00:03:32.239> was<00:03:32.329> just<00:03:32.629> you<00:03:32.750> know

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
and at this point it was just you know

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.179 
and at this point it was just you know
tipping<00:03:33.200> the<00:03:33.349> bass<00:03:33.530> a<00:03:33.560> little<00:03:33.769> bit<00:03:33.980> right<00:03:34.129> now

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:34.189 
tipping the bass a little bit right now

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:37.820 
tipping the bass a little bit right now
it's<00:03:34.489> not<00:03:34.670> tipping<00:03:35.030> at<00:03:35.150> all

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.800 

so<00:03:38.370> I<00:03:38.400> think<00:03:38.670> the<00:03:38.940> third<00:03:39.150> bolt<00:03:39.390> you<00:03:39.540> know<00:03:39.630> made

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
so I think the third bolt you know made

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.750 
so I think the third bolt you know made
it<00:03:39.990> run<00:03:40.470> okay<00:03:41.960> right<00:03:42.960> now<00:03:43.080> it's<00:03:43.260> at<00:03:43.380> 30<00:03:43.760> 30

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
it run okay right now it's at 30 30

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.080 
it run okay right now it's at 30 30
percent<00:03:45.180> joint

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.960 

join<00:03:48.660> 30%

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.360 

much<00:03:53.630> faster<00:03:54.050> than<00:03:54.260> a<00:03:54.290> much<00:03:54.920> better<00:03:55.100> than

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
much faster than a much better than

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.460 
much faster than a much better than
before<00:03:55.810> you<00:03:56.810> have<00:03:56.960> it

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
before you have it

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.470 
before you have it
let's<00:03:59.040> even<00:03:59.250> bump<00:03:59.490> it<00:03:59.610> up<00:03:59.670> higher<00:03:59.940> let's<00:04:00.270> bump

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
let's even bump it up higher let's bump

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:10.760 
let's even bump it up higher let's bump
it<00:04:00.540> up<00:04:00.630> to<00:04:00.810> 40<00:04:01.850> as<00:04:02.850> well<00:04:03.860> %<00:04:04.860> up

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:16.430 

and<00:04:11.130> that's<00:04:11.520> at<00:04:11.760> 14

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.909 

that's<00:04:17.010> at<00:04:17.160> 40%<00:04:17.850> so<00:04:18.120> we<00:04:18.300> still<00:04:18.480> have<00:04:18.570> 60%<00:04:19.200> to<00:04:19.320> go

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
that's at 40% so we still have 60% to go

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:33.280 
that's at 40% so we still have 60% to go
and<00:04:21.489> my<00:04:21.879> base<00:04:22.090> is<00:04:22.300> holding<00:04:22.689> so<00:04:22.870> that's<00:04:23.080> good

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.700 

yeah<00:04:33.620> my<00:04:33.860> base<00:04:34.040> is<00:04:34.070> holding<00:04:34.550> no<00:04:34.700> problem

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.830 

so<00:04:38.160> I'll<00:04:38.400> you<00:04:38.580> know<00:04:38.699> even<00:04:39.000> bump<00:04:39.270> it<00:04:39.419> up<00:04:39.509> to<00:04:39.570> at

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
so I'll you know even bump it up to at

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.790 
so I'll you know even bump it up to at
50%

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.420 

and<00:04:46.310> this<00:04:46.490> is<00:04:46.610> enjoined<00:04:47.000> movement

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
and this is enjoined movement

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:55.560 
and this is enjoined movement
so<00:04:49.970> jump<00:04:50.300> I<00:04:50.509> jump<00:04:50.570> it<00:04:50.900> up<00:04:50.960> the<00:04:51.199> 50%

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:16.490 

that's<00:04:56.140> at<00:04:56.320> 50%

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.760 

that's<00:05:16.950> a<00:05:17.040> 50%

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:28.120 

and<00:05:22.130> I'll<00:05:22.490> bump<00:05:22.699> it<00:05:22.849> up<00:05:22.910> to<00:05:22.970> 16

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:34.969 

and<00:05:28.610> that's<00:05:28.820> joint<00:05:29.150> 16

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:37.409 

and<00:05:35.979> that's<00:05:36.310> actually<00:05:36.699> we're<00:05:36.940> gonna<00:05:37.120> put<00:05:37.300> it

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419 
and that's actually we're gonna put it

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:39.960 
and that's actually we're gonna put it
then<00:05:37.630> that<00:05:37.870> smack<00:05:38.169> some<00:05:38.410> of<00:05:38.560> it<00:05:38.729> because<00:05:39.729> my

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
then that smack some of it because my

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.909 
then that smack some of it because my
son<00:05:40.030> of<00:05:40.449> a<00:05:40.509> gun<00:05:40.660> it<00:05:40.810> starts<00:05:41.199> to<00:05:41.440> tipping<00:05:41.800> my

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 
son of a gun it starts to tipping my

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:47.189 
son of a gun it starts to tipping my
face<00:05:42.130> a<00:05:42.160> little<00:05:42.310> bit

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:47.199 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:50.749 

and<00:05:47.889> that's<00:05:48.159> back<00:05:48.460> at<00:05:48.639> 20

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:50.759 
and that's back at 20
