of<00:03:39.150> those<00:03:39.209> fish<00:03:39.540> and<00:03:39.780> make<00:03:40.109> the<00:03:40.260> first<00:03:40.500> shot

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
of those fish and make the first shot

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.199 
of those fish and make the first shot
count<00:03:40.920> so<00:03:41.489> if<00:03:41.519> I'm<00:03:41.730> just<00:03:41.760> haphazardly

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
count so if I'm just haphazardly

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.050 
count so if I'm just haphazardly
throwing<00:03:43.139> us<00:03:43.260> out<00:03:43.380> there<00:03:43.650> I<00:03:43.859> can<00:03:44.700> get<00:03:44.850> it<00:03:44.970> away

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
throwing us out there I can get it away

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.940 
throwing us out there I can get it away
from<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.420> boat<00:03:45.630> but<00:03:46.230> it<00:03:46.319> has<00:03:46.440> very<00:03:46.560> little

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
from the boat but it has very little

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.650 
from the boat but it has very little
accuracy<00:03:47.549> I<00:03:48.290> want<00:03:49.290> to<00:03:49.380> always<00:03:49.530> use<00:03:49.709> two<00:03:50.190> hands

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
accuracy I want to always use two hands

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.539 
accuracy I want to always use two hands
the<00:03:51.660> bottom<00:03:52.049> hand<00:03:52.319> is<00:03:52.739> what<00:03:52.980> helps<00:03:53.280> generate

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
the bottom hand is what helps generate

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.150 
the bottom hand is what helps generate
tip<00:03:54.060> speed<00:03:54.359> which<00:03:55.019> what's<00:03:55.650> going<00:03:55.829> to<00:03:55.859> get<00:03:56.010> my

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
tip speed which what's going to get my

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.710 
tip speed which what's going to get my
lure<00:03:56.370> away<00:03:56.519> from<00:03:56.639> that<00:03:56.910> boat<00:03:57.120> because<00:03:57.569> there's

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
lure away from that boat because there's

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.449 
lure away from that boat because there's
a<00:03:57.750> lot<00:03:57.900> of<00:03:57.930> times<00:03:58.170> we're<00:03:58.350> using<00:03:58.530> light<00:03:58.859> lures<00:03:59.160> a

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
a lot of times we're using light lures a

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.360 
a lot of times we're using light lures a
quarter<00:04:00.000> ounce<00:04:00.349> I'm<00:04:01.349> using<00:04:01.560> this<00:04:01.739> bottom<00:04:02.160> hand

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
quarter ounce I'm using this bottom hand

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.610 
quarter ounce I'm using this bottom hand
to<00:04:02.700> snap<00:04:03.239> that<00:04:03.480> tip<00:04:03.720> around<00:04:03.989> because<00:04:04.290> it's<00:04:04.440> how

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
to snap that tip around because it's how

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.860 
to snap that tip around because it's how
how<00:04:05.220> fast<00:04:05.579> I<00:04:05.819> move<00:04:06.000> that<00:04:06.209> tip<00:04:06.450> it's<00:04:06.599> not<00:04:06.720> how

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
how fast I move that tip it's not how

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.990 
how fast I move that tip it's not how
big<00:04:07.109> and<00:04:07.260> strong<00:04:07.440> I<00:04:07.650> am<00:04:07.680> this<00:04:08.280> is<00:04:08.340> a<00:04:08.519> simple

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
big and strong I am this is a simple

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.420 
big and strong I am this is a simple
lever<00:04:09.239> it's<00:04:09.540> all<00:04:09.690> about<00:04:09.959> physics<00:04:10.440> we<00:04:10.980> use<00:04:11.190> that

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
lever it's all about physics we use that

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.400 
lever it's all about physics we use that
to<00:04:11.579> snap<00:04:11.849> the<00:04:12.030> tip<00:04:12.209> around<00:04:12.450> and<00:04:13.019> with<00:04:13.139> very

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
to snap the tip around and with very

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.650 
to snap the tip around and with very
little<00:04:13.470> effort<00:04:13.829> we<00:04:14.819> can<00:04:14.940> get<00:04:15.090> that<00:04:15.239> thing<00:04:15.480> to

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
little effort we can get that thing to

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.379 
little effort we can get that thing to
go<00:04:15.810> super<00:04:16.650> flies<00:04:16.829> farther<00:04:17.519> that<00:04:17.789> I'm<00:04:18.150> ever

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
go super flies farther that I'm ever

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.150 
go super flies farther that I'm ever
gonna<00:04:18.599> have<00:04:18.870> to<00:04:19.019> cast<00:04:19.229> when<00:04:19.829> I'm<00:04:19.950> sight

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
gonna have to cast when I'm sight

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.039 
gonna have to cast when I'm sight
fishing<00:04:20.519> on<00:04:20.639> the<00:04:20.729> flats<00:04:20.970> and<00:04:21.329> you<00:04:21.630> see<00:04:21.810> I<00:04:21.840> use

fishing on the flats and you see I use

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.460 
fishing on the flats and you see I use
very<00:04:22.349> little<00:04:22.530> effort<00:04:22.820> now<00:04:24.020> especially<00:04:25.020> if<00:04:25.349> we

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
very little effort now especially if we

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.380 
very little effort now especially if we
have<00:04:25.590> two<00:04:25.800> people<00:04:26.130> in<00:04:26.220> the<00:04:26.310> boat<00:04:26.490> but<00:04:26.700> even<00:04:27.270> if

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390 
have two people in the boat but even if

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.120 
have two people in the boat but even if

you're the only guy up here there's a
lot<00:04:29.250> of<00:04:29.400> times

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
lot of times

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.090 
lot of times
where<00:04:30.060> the<00:04:30.570> fish<00:04:30.750> will<00:04:30.990> can<00:04:31.290> be<00:04:31.320> on<00:04:31.620> your

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
where the fish will can be on your

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.850 
where the fish will can be on your
right-hand<00:04:33.030> side<00:04:33.480> if<00:04:33.660> your<00:04:33.780> right<00:04:33.930> handed<00:04:34.290> so

right-hand side if your right handed so

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.980 
right-hand side if your right handed so
I'm<00:04:34.950> facing<00:04:35.160> this<00:04:35.430> way<00:04:35.670> if<00:04:36.210> I'm<00:04:36.390> fishing<00:04:36.690> this

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
I'm facing this way if I'm fishing this

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.900 
I'm facing this way if I'm fishing this
direction<00:04:37.530> there's<00:04:37.860> just<00:04:38.130> much<00:04:38.430> chance<00:04:38.730> the

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
direction there's just much chance the

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.670 
direction there's just much chance the
fish<00:04:39.090> can<00:04:39.270> be<00:04:39.360> over<00:04:39.630> here<00:04:39.870> instead<00:04:40.470> of<00:04:40.590> me

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
fish can be over here instead of me

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.350 
fish can be over here instead of me
having<00:04:41.040> to<00:04:41.070> take<00:04:41.310> my<00:04:41.520> time<00:04:41.760> and<00:04:42.060> turn<00:04:42.210> around

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
having to take my time and turn around

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.810 
having to take my time and turn around
and<00:04:42.720> cats<00:04:42.870> four-handed<00:04:43.590> sometimes<00:04:44.520> it's

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
and cats four-handed sometimes it's

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.800 
and cats four-handed sometimes it's
faster<00:04:45.240> just<00:04:45.450> to<00:04:45.540> fling<00:04:46.320> a<00:04:46.440> cast<00:04:46.680> out<00:04:46.920> back<00:04:47.190> in

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
faster just to fling a cast out back in

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.240 
faster just to fling a cast out back in
again<00:04:48.810> it's<00:04:48.960> the<00:04:49.110> same<00:04:49.140> cast<00:04:49.770> that<00:04:50.010> I<00:04:50.040> make

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
again it's the same cast that I make

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.220 
again it's the same cast that I make
from<00:04:50.370> the<00:04:50.490> forehand<00:04:50.850> side<00:04:51.120> here's<00:04:52.050> my

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
from the forehand side here's my

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.920 
from the forehand side here's my
forehand<00:04:52.770> grip<00:04:53.010> here's<00:04:54.000> my<00:04:54.210> forehand<00:04:54.660> stroke

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
forehand grip here's my forehand stroke

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.220 
forehand grip here's my forehand stroke
I<00:04:55.410> just<00:04:56.160> make<00:04:56.340> a<00:04:56.370> little<00:04:56.610> short<00:04:57.060> flick<00:04:57.450> using

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
I just make a little short flick using

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.990 
I just make a little short flick using
the<00:04:58.740> bottom<00:04:59.040> hand<00:04:59.280> to<00:04:59.370> pull<00:04:59.550> the<00:04:59.700> rod<00:04:59.850> around

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
the bottom hand to pull the rod around

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.750 
the bottom hand to pull the rod around
when<00:05:00.720> I<00:05:00.750> want<00:05:00.960> to<00:05:00.990> cast<00:05:01.170> back<00:05:01.440> in<00:05:01.710> I've<00:05:02.400> using

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
when I want to cast back in I've using

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.280 
when I want to cast back in I've using
that<00:05:02.880> same<00:05:03.090> bottom<00:05:03.450> hand<00:05:03.660> I'm<00:05:03.750> just<00:05:03.870> pulling

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
that same bottom hand I'm just pulling

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.620 
that same bottom hand I'm just pulling
it<00:05:04.440> in<00:05:04.590> the<00:05:04.830> other<00:05:04.980> direction<00:05:05.270> this<00:05:06.270> way<00:05:06.480> I'm

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
it in the other direction this way I'm

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.390 
it in the other direction this way I'm
pushing<00:05:07.020> with<00:05:07.050> my<00:05:07.170> palm<00:05:07.500> this<00:05:08.100> way<00:05:08.340> I'm

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
pushing with my palm this way I'm

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.120 
pushing with my palm this way I'm
pulling<00:05:09.270> with<00:05:09.390> my<00:05:09.570> fingers<00:05:09.960> and<00:05:10.500> I<00:05:10.620> help<00:05:10.830> pull

that tip around and again that lure

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.800 
that tip around and again that lure
should<00:05:13.800> never<00:05:14.040> go<00:05:14.280> more<00:05:14.910> than<00:05:14.970> 10<00:05:15.390> feet<00:05:15.630> off
