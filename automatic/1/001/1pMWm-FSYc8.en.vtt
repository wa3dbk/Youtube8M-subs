00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
middle with my main attack right so this

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.429

that<00:01:48.869> cannon<00:01:49.259> so<00:01:49.350> they<00:01:49.470> don't<00:01:49.619> take<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.799> walk

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
that cannon so they don't take a walk

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.679 
that cannon so they don't take a walk
around<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.460> edge<00:01:50.640> I'm<00:01:51.090> going<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.270> drop<00:01:51.479> my

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
around the edge I'm going to drop my

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.690 
around the edge I'm going to drop my
Wizards<00:01:52.500> right<00:01:52.770> afterwards<00:01:53.280> make<00:01:53.430> sure<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.579> get

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
Wizards right afterwards make sure I get

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.300 
Wizards right afterwards make sure I get
those<00:01:54.180> barracks<00:01:54.630> on<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.899> due<00:01:55.350> west<00:01:55.680> side<00:01:55.979> and

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
those barracks on the due west side and

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.920 
those barracks on the due west side and
then<00:01:56.880> i'm<00:01:57.000> going<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.180> start<00:01:57.360> bringing<00:01:57.630> my<00:01:57.659> wall

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
then i'm going to start bringing my wall

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.109 
then i'm going to start bringing my wall
breakers<00:01:58.380> in<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:59.130> i'm<00:01:59.520> bringing<00:01:59.759> my<00:01:59.969> wall

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
breakers in so i'm bringing my wall

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.330 
breakers in so i'm bringing my wall
breakers<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.689> i'm<00:02:00.780> hoping<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.229> cut<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.619> hole<00:02:01.979> in

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
breakers and i'm hoping to cut a hole in

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.240 
breakers and i'm hoping to cut a hole in
the<00:02:02.579> north<00:02:02.880> end<00:02:03.119> over<00:02:03.479> here<00:02:03.509> or<00:02:03.960> do<00:02:04.380> see<00:02:05.070> these

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
the north end over here or do see these

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.920 
the north end over here or do see these
wall<00:02:05.430> breakers<00:02:05.759> right<00:02:06.090> over<00:02:06.270> here<00:02:06.420> go<00:02:06.600> exactly

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
wall breakers right over here go exactly

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.449 
wall breakers right over here go exactly
where<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.229> want<00:02:07.560> them<00:02:07.619> now<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.860> have<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.280> whole

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
where I want them now I have the whole

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.089 
where I want them now I have the whole
made<00:02:08.789> so<00:02:09.300> things<00:02:09.899> right<00:02:10.140> now<00:02:10.170> look<00:02:10.679> like<00:02:10.920> they

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
made so things right now look like they

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.430 
made so things right now look like they
could<00:02:11.160> be<00:02:11.459> going<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:11.790> little<00:02:11.940> off

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
could be going a little off

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.830 
could be going a little off
right<00:02:12.800> because<00:02:12.980> I<00:02:13.160> have<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.460> the<00:02:14.240> golems<00:02:14.600> kind

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
right because I have the the golems kind

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.600 
right because I have the the golems kind
of<00:02:14.930> held<00:02:15.080> up<00:02:15.260> over<00:02:15.500> here<00:02:15.680> but<00:02:16.190> if<00:02:16.280> you<00:02:16.400> look

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
of held up over here but if you look

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.490 
of held up over here but if you look
none<00:02:17.060> of<00:02:17.090> my<00:02:17.300> troops<00:02:17.660> are<00:02:17.810> under<00:02:18.050> any<00:02:18.230> heavy

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
none of my troops are under any heavy

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.380 
none of my troops are under any heavy
firepower<00:02:18.890> right<00:02:19.430> now<00:02:19.580> so<00:02:19.820> even<00:02:20.150> though<00:02:20.240> the

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
firepower right now so even though the

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.690 
firepower right now so even though the
gums<00:02:20.600> are<00:02:20.900> hung<00:02:21.050> up<00:02:21.200> on<00:02:21.320> this<00:02:21.470> blue<00:02:21.740> wall<00:02:22.010> is

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
gums are hung up on this blue wall is

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.010 
gums are hung up on this blue wall is
actually<00:02:23.060> not<00:02:23.150> a<00:02:23.210> big<00:02:23.420> issue<00:02:23.570> right<00:02:23.810> now

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
actually not a big issue right now

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.680 
actually not a big issue right now
because<00:02:24.590> there's<00:02:25.460> really<00:02:25.700> no<00:02:26.000> defensive

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
because there's really no defensive

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.780 
because there's really no defensive
units<00:02:26.990> left<00:02:27.290> standing<00:02:27.860> that<00:02:28.190> are<00:02:28.370> targeting

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
units left standing that are targeting

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.490 
units left standing that are targeting
my<00:02:28.940> unit<00:02:28.970> so<00:02:29.420> it<00:02:29.450> looks<00:02:29.780> like<00:02:29.870> this<00:02:30.140> kind<00:02:30.380> of

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
my unit so it looks like this kind of

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.530 
my unit so it looks like this kind of
things<00:02:31.280> are<00:02:31.430> going<00:02:31.670> wrong<00:02:31.910> but<00:02:32.210> things<00:02:32.420> are

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
things are going wrong but things are

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.360 
things are going wrong but things are
actually<00:02:32.690> going<00:02:32.960> fine<00:02:33.290> right<00:02:33.560> now<00:02:33.590> what<00:02:34.250> I'm

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.600 
up to the other troops and this is what
I<00:02:44.000> wanted<00:02:44.330> to<00:02:44.390> do<00:02:44.690> so<00:02:45.260> I<00:02:45.560> make<00:02:46.070> it<00:02:46.220> sometimes

I wanted to do so I make it sometimes
the<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:47.180> king<00:02:47.420> will<00:02:47.600> take<00:02:47.810> a<00:02:48.020> stroll<00:02:48.590> down

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
way you'll have success with this

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.830 
way you'll have success with this
strategy<00:02:54.950> against<00:02:55.370> this<00:02:55.520> base<00:02:55.760> now<00:02:56.390> when<00:02:56.810> I

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
strategy against this base now when I

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.540 
strategy against this base now when I
did<00:02:57.020> the<00:02:57.080> last<00:02:57.260> base<00:02:57.590> review<00:02:57.860> I<00:02:58.070> just<00:02:58.340> want<00:02:58.490> to

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
did the last base review I just want to

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.430 
did the last base review I just want to
touch<00:02:58.700> real<00:02:58.940> quickly<00:02:59.150> that<00:02:59.450> people<00:02:59.990> said<00:03:00.230> can

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
touch real quickly that people said can

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.750 
touch real quickly that people said can
you<00:03:00.470> attack<00:03:00.800> these<00:03:00.950> bases<00:03:01.310> without<00:03:01.400> massive

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
you attack these bases without massive

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.610 
you attack these bases without massive
max<00:03:02.120> heroes<00:03:02.480> and<00:03:02.720> I<00:03:03.080> wouldn't<00:03:03.380> advocate

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
max heroes and I wouldn't advocate

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.980 
max heroes and I wouldn't advocate
attacking<00:03:04.190> totally<00:03:04.880> max<00:03:05.210> base<00:03:05.510> with<00:03:05.780> max

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
attacking totally max base with max

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.320 
attacking totally max base with max
heroes<00:03:06.350> in<00:03:06.530> max<00:03:06.740> walls<00:03:07.040> without<00:03:07.580> max<00:03:07.970> heroes

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
heroes in max walls without max heroes

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.150 
heroes in max walls without max heroes
but<00:03:08.480> it<00:03:08.600> can<00:03:08.780> be<00:03:08.930> done<00:03:08.960> using<00:03:09.350> the<00:03:09.560> same<00:03:09.740> method

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
but it can be done using the same method

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.730 
but it can be done using the same method
so<00:03:10.730> uh<00:03:11.000> but<00:03:11.960> of<00:03:12.080> course<00:03:12.290> if<00:03:12.380> you<00:03:12.440> find<00:03:12.620> this

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740 
so uh but of course if you find this

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.250 
so uh but of course if you find this
this<00:03:13.190> base<00:03:13.430> design<00:03:13.880> with<00:03:14.330> lower<00:03:14.660> level

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
this base design with lower level

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.290 
this base design with lower level
defenses<00:03:16.160> go<00:03:16.190> ahead<00:03:16.550> and<00:03:16.670> hit<00:03:16.790> it<00:03:16.940> with<00:03:17.060> lower

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
defenses go ahead and hit it with lower

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.360
