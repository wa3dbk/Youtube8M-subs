00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.110 
always kind of been my passion is
shooting<00:00:50.039> people<00:00:50.219> in<00:00:50.399> their<00:00:50.579> spaces<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.090> think

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
shooting people in their spaces I think

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.900 
shooting people in their spaces I think
it<00:00:51.390> says<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.840> lot<00:00:52.020> about<00:00:52.320> who<00:00:52.649> they<00:00:52.800> are<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.309> so

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
it says a lot about who they are and so

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.400 
it says a lot about who they are and so
I<00:00:53.940> thought<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.510> my<00:00:54.629> second<00:00:55.050> book<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.320> was
