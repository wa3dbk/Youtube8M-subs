00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.009
 minutes 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.020

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.219
 mischief 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.110
 I've come up with something absolutely 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.840
 I'm sure I can pass what 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.890
 her on the principle of the hole camera and 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.480
 I have this morning on the 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.850
 small instruction to build the for 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.769
 Every one of the chips likes after 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.189
 and what exactly is up with the invention 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.500
 has become the watch must now 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:13.439
 Above all, we need a chipset

 stabilizing soil with a 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:29.939
 Wooden logs can do the median and drill 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:33.240

 then develop glued then need 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.909
 we cut a section out of the socket 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.610
 about six inches deep 14 mm 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.060
 wide and need a 20 cm long 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.060
 Strip black cardboard above the light 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.380
