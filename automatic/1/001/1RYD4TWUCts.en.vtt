00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:10.320
 gardening tips with jupp signs the 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.150
 I plant a tree properly 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.910
 plant course you need a 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.920
 spades that the most important instrument 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.859
 you need a tree drive material 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.590
 to connect and then in schlgl to 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.630
 to smash the tree and one 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.580
 pink scissors that one roots 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.369
 can cut off or increase 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.040
 right and of course, too 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.250
 Soil improvement agent for example 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:39.120
 compost the tree is of course important 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.770
 he must be good quality and that was 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.500
 actually everything you need so 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.300
 let's go with that already 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.309
 before that the ground was churned up 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.870
 was and is simply used to the 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.850
 cross say rework 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.940
 but it may be my big hole that 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.280
 shows that makes and then could 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.039
 laugh because only in a tree setting 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.020
 that's very important before you get the tree 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:16.830
 Rhine there beating the tree club 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:18.920
 but it tingles it but first now 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.420
 I feel the floor again right and 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.159
 upsetting by a bit of ground 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.350
 improvement agent with pure and there 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.110
 I can already clean the room 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.970
 then beat this is gc 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.500
 So the compost does not rot anybody 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.079
 give fresh compose to the roots 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.460
 and do not approach mineral fertilizers 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.159
 She does not want to tolerate her 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.380
 then just properly ordered compost 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.689
 but it does not compose everything 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.090
 freshly planted tree does well 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.329
 This is a floor improvement center 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.159
 lacrosse and the floor will live 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.990
 stimulated by it and that gives me too 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.720
 a bit with but not too much 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.860
 2300 momentous entirely of it 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.860
 is enough for a few years 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.130
 If I was in the tree now , hit it like that 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.590
 enter through the west towards the Rhine 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.830
 that's because of the wind 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.450
 90 percent comes from the west and that 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.140
 the tree squashed against the tree with 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.870
 rather 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.560
 the building world is pushed by the valley and 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.810
 the west side purely and never should 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.550
 when planting snow or ice with 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.590
 come in frozen ground 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.510
 then the trees are broken when snow 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.910
 with come in, there are cavities that 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.890
 absolutely can not quite tolerate the root 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.450
 important is that the root 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.730
 are cut so fresher 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.330
 cut with the pink scissors and that way 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:42.540
 that the cutler is coming down than me 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.550
 up there and through the fresh cut 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.280
 Suction roots of the blues funk form 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.640
 Everything out of the wish 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.800
 then rooted out and 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.590
 the growing much faster 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.530
 in the nursery they will be out 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.390
 wernigerode the trees and then they are 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.650
 burnt roots therefore also the 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.959
 he cut very smoothly all the way 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.140
 important and cut a word 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.450
 Power goes the tree all the time 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.550
 pure in the ground and very important 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.980
 that the refinement that is the 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.170
 thick place here the production in the 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.030
 Finishing must necessarily from the ground 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.920
 look out and not entered 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.329
 be because otherwise picture up there 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.310
 Roots that she did not want 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.350
 especially in very weak growing 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.200
 It is very important to grow it 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:31.380
 finishing looks out because otherwise quite a 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.970
 strong grow on every cms of documents 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.620
 that it's not that bad in may 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:39.420
 have to come in ways 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:41.250
 but it should always look out and 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.170
 I always have to fill the earth 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.880
 again so that the root shake well 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.220
 get the bottom of the deal now there's 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.989
 another trick against voles should 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.130
 help 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.829
 but it is not one hundred percent and 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.390
 Although all fibula of all imperial crown 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:57.150
 into the ground with 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.489
 she is very strong and holds the 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.329
 That's why voles also give up and I give 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:05.329
 now with those in the ground and 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.329
 look around 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.800
 important is still the magazine of the soil 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.170
 it has become damp that you can not 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.959
 together pure boots pushes but 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.970
 very easy to press that is better 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.070
 after that offer to be poured and then there 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.770
 it is in the bottom but now firmly 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.150
 You do not do that 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.490
 After I now made purely in tree 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.200
 I see that he is far too long 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.080
 is coming even deeper in 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:35.560
 violence is under rock and that's why 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.690
 the tree is sawn off and that until 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.620
 below that led to below the 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.960
 baumkrone 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.750
 otherwise control the first always in 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.660
 the tree inside and it's not good 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.250
 but must stay off lower 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.130
 in the lap and nice and around 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.650
 expertly from now the young must 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:56.020
 tree still be tied to a pole 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.800
 There is also a lot to it 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.840
 note 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.630
 important is that the bend is not so 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.400
 is firm on the tree but loose and 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.700
 have to distance that has them too 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.470
 can move a bit and above all 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.810
 hire because he is still at it the 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.490
 ground he is very far out of our dug 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.860
 loose and thus there is also broke 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.710
 and that with him 100 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:21.190
 otherwise it can be put up 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:23.050
 and air and about 100 percent one so 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.060
 let loose over coco 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:28.240
 Strictly speaking, because it's easiest 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:30.550
 is and not one cuts he can 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.240
 but also a gut dull eg 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.400
 hernehmen 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.900
 It is also important that you play yes 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.170
 keep watching the next one 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.970
 years the trick does not grow in 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.980
 The trunk when he grows a cut 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.110
 Do not off and cattle on bark cold 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.000
 grows denser and becomes the tree 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:49.120
 weakened for a lifetime so always 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.680
 take care that the bark does not 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:55.390
 one grows strictly in the strict course 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:59.470
 I am now doing a plastic spiral 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:01.840
 Do not hunt the tree with it in the winter 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.850
 The bark can cling in the cold 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.490
 winter with plenty of snow to hit the 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:10.090
 single hare can often be the 30 40 trees 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:12.880
 plants and larger trees will be 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:15.750
 often attacked when it is very cold 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.380
 that's why a hare wire or 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:21.510
 drum made one or so a spiral 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:23.760
 after we did all this tree 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:25.920
 implanted office he becomes strong once 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.440
 that is important that the 

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.510
 So roots do not end 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.520
 before a pounding but really 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:37.170
 Cast heavily and that was enough for the 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:39.360
 winter out now the tree is done it 

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:41.460
 is in the ground and I think so 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.920
 also grows when planted 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:46.290
 then there is no difficulty was 

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:50.750
 continues to grow in spring and 34 years 

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:50.750
 already beautiful apples can carry
