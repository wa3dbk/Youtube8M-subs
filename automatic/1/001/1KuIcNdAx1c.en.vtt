00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.980
 but applications from sitting which will simplify 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:15.440
 you will make the game cooler all owners 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:19.140
 the same games for phones and just 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:22.230
 will be like fun let's 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:27.529
 consider this application this application 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:32.880
 called a in-game city he is a nerd 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:35.880
 it can be downloaded on the network in some 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.910
 repositories repository I will also 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.980
 show and well, in principle, so long 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.690
 they did not write it in the comments 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.320
 the rest is how it simplifies us 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.300
 makes life easier for us 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:55.260
 excuse me this is something like 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:58.399
 artmani or cheat engine here you can 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:03.270
 choose the process we want 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:08.479
 Well, for example, we want a tooth and sur 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:13.070
 charge money so let's see 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:16.409
 how much money do we have now 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:20.340
 Well, in short, this amount is the same 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.509
 charge with it just let's 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:30.180
 I'll show you all the same 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:34.290
 on something to rule the minkravt and here 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:37.439
 here we write for example what we will look for 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.200
 for example 33 well for example that is 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.970
 you for example 30 for and tree minecraft 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.189
 eat and you want to make it up 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.640
 infinity choose the one we need 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:51.420
 process well it is not necessary once 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.060
 look for that is not from just 33 dial 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.659
 his all here these mark and then a little 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.939
 a little chest lay out a tree and for example 30 y 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.619
 we will remain 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:05.219
 Well, there will not be here because we have to 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:09.170
 sorry not there and then after 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.789
 we found it now we find something 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:15.109
 randomly such 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:19.670
 here we write what I want I will write 

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:22.329
 joker for example we go in the safe here we are 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.549
 see this crap click here and 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:26.090
 enter here the number we want 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:30.200
 press ok 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:34.280
 go in our game and we need 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:37.790
 the amount of everything we need by the way I will give 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:41.090
 thread burn it out because of the good 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:45.290
 applications to him and there just everything at all 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:47.750
 cool fun already here in principle 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.930
 I have in all applications 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:57.439
 such a tank up for example here in this 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:03:00.379
 Zombie application Artem I could 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:03.799
 gulf voice well, in short, now I tell you 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:06.439
 I will show a bug in this application, I probably 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:09.169
 I do not know I will be silent or can speak 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:12.260
 there will be no voice shorter here 

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:17.120
 it is charged money and therefore small 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:19.040
 that's something like 27 cavalry just yes and I 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.729
 I do not know, do not talk about the regiments 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.699
 not gone 

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:31.220
 and that's why you need to deal with voice acting 

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:34.549
 Well, in short, you understand the following video 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.829
 there will be a flood of my top five apps 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:41.030
 which i will play maybe 6 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:41.840
 there is a thread and the program will even pass 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.870
 ten 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:49.519
 i look yes well let me tell you 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:54.919
 tell about one more 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:58.129
 the program is called it ai file in what 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:04:03.810
 The meaning of this program is 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:08.650
 program to climb 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:12.040
 so to speak inside the iPhone for example 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:14.069
 these are all our games let's type 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:23.860
 for example here aa 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:27.490
 18 so here 18 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:30.910
 and this is our maykravt that is, there are many 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:35.710
 there is a tutorial how to trade ken here 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:40.690
 shorter but here you need to find a shorter file 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:46.720
 there replace it here is cha cha mouth is mine 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:49.389
 skin change is shorter replace here 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.780
 such a crap to very useful to us 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:56.020
 I think I like more knowledge 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:59.729
 what uses for it as tuscan 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:02.289
 mikroft really no know okay 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:04.660
 with you was basically a joker 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:08.409
 subscribe put likes like 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:10.949
