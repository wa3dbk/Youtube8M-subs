milk
this<00:03:59.960> is<00:04:00.110> optional<00:04:00.350> but<00:04:00.710> I<00:04:00.860> think<00:04:01.130> it<00:04:01.220> really

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
this is optional but I think it really

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.820 
this is optional but I think it really
kicks<00:04:01.790> this<00:04:02.030> salad<00:04:02.510> you<00:04:03.140> know<00:04:03.260> to<00:04:03.319> a<00:04:03.590> next

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
kicks this salad you know to a next

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.180 
kicks this salad you know to a next
level<00:04:05.050> so<00:04:06.050> we'll<00:04:06.260> just<00:04:06.290> put<00:04:06.590> a<00:04:06.620> little<00:04:06.680> bit<00:04:07.130> of

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
level so we'll just put a little bit of

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.610 
level so we'll just put a little bit of
that<00:04:07.400> maybe<00:04:08.209> a<00:04:08.330> tablespoon<00:04:08.630> you<00:04:09.319> don't<00:04:09.470> want

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
that maybe a tablespoon you don't want

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.210 
that maybe a tablespoon you don't want
to<00:04:09.680> overpower<00:04:10.160> it<00:04:10.450> and<00:04:11.800> that's<00:04:12.800> the<00:04:13.010> finished

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
to overpower it and that's the finished

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.580 
to overpower it and that's the finished
