00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 funda defeat in this second round here 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.940
 in mazatlán cuba 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.639
 taking into account then the result is 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.110
 the one each other's game 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.580
 teams that are in this round 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.519
 remains with a mark of two cattle and two 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.680
 lost like the Chinese Taipei and 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.230
 mexico also has two wins and two 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.630
 you defeat so the second ticket 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.330
 to the final of this world championship 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.580
 sub 15 is going to be defined tomorrow waiting 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.010
 the three results of the day it's jorge 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.830
 Morning match between Chinese Taipei 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.020
 and venezuela the match of the afternoon I think 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.820
 which is Cuba against Panama and in the 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.630
 night party of mexico against 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.520
 USA 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.200
 so then nothing is written yet 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.140
 a very important win for the team 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.340
 Mexican who still has losses tomorrow 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.469
 of the three teams that we are 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.289
 mentioning Chinese Taipei and Mexico cave 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.149
 they would go to a jump-off for races and 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.070
 that we would have to wait until the 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.500
 last moment that the 27 of the 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.470
 party tomorrow night 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.460
 super interesting this rubén while 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.790
 that we see just the teams there 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.560
 say gooobye 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.270
 after a big ball crash 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.070
 really recognition because no 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.870
 only for Mexicans who won the 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.420
 party but also for Cubans if we 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:16.090
 let's go to the summary here we are seeing 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.490
 like the rest of Martínez could not stay 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.730
 with the tablazo of staying us the 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.220
 ball goes to the right 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:27.560
 is noticing the race of the tie of the 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:30.140
 Mexican team this did not end 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.700
 because here the national squad 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.100
 Mexicana continued to descend corridors 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.490
 right in this chapter in the fourth 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.159
 to fill the house and everything was ready 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.780
 for this robert hit just from 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.939
 Luis Rodríguez, who went to the 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.189
 park background and produced three races 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:47.960
 that made a difference and then the 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.970
 difference in the game the moment 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.070
 it was for Mexico that he took the 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.799
 advantage game could no longer be lifted 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.479
 evicts of three races attempt 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.179
 do it with one more but mexico 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.250
 replied in the same tone noting another 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:03.140
 to score the final score of 5 for 2 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.580
 when here we are looking at the top of the 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.799
 third base the land of payments that 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.049
 we said that he had worked there 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.330
 the space on earth of in terrain 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:13.640
 foul and therefore mexico with a very 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.769
 important jorge that places it then to 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.990
 one more to stay in the fight for 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:20.360
 that second place for the final 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.470
 definitely this has been 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.740
 very important for the Mexican squad 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.950
 while we still see there those of the 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:32.090
 I find and how the domain of the 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.730
 mexican pitcher luis rodríguez 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.610
 just about a strong offensive 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.040
 as is the case of the Cuban national 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.610
 so it was still the advantage for the 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.610
 National team 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.190
 gaining mexico in those four moments 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.020
 races for two was led to put the 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.180
 score that is fourth here was key to me 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.800
 the austere face or not with which in 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.970
 Cuba left and the possibility of 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:01.160
 approaching on the blackboard and it was just 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.680
 in the seventh chapter when in step and 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.959
 run scoring career 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.440
 just osca red and at that time 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:13.310
 At that time, Mexico put the 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.830
 freezer the marker and had 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:19.110
 precisely the advantage already five 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:21.120
 two would still see this action what 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.620
 was about to dump just 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.230
 oscar rojas the Mexican pitcher 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:31.099
 here he sacrifices himself doing a very good 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.510
 work then with this or robert then 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.959
 we are reaching the final part of the 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:38.120
 transmission a perfect red relay 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:40.280
 José Luis retired in order to 10 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.629
 hitters that faced entering 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.720
 after triple the Cuban Lazaro 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:48.880
 armenteros in the sixth inning 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.830
 did not strike out any more than the first two 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.270
 faced good on the sides of what 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.610
 I was starting the seventh episode 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.800
 to breathe in order to ten and 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.120
 keep that triumph very well rubén 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.310
 thank you very much for having us 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.190
 accompany in this transmission before 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.170
 say goodbye to them I give them the final strip 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.700
 Mexican team wins its five game 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.740
 he races five hits and one error loses 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.980
 Cuba with two races six hits and 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:14.320
 couple of mistakes wins in a great job 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:18.780
 monticular luis rodríguez loses pedro 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.780
 rightly the Cuban opener
