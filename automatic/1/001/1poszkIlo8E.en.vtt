00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:08.719
 crash test number 2 has already welded to our 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.450
 filter 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:15.570
 I can and now again our 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:19.289
 torque wrench trying 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:26.250
 look yes with what we can so 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:32.660
 apparently I think you should see our 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:35.660
 paper until we can break 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.660
 an effort 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:58.250
 I repeat, I ran into a small 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:58.250
 problem i will try 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:18.200
 so that was so it was visible 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.250
 must be exactly 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:45.690
 yes we get there we get here but 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:48.450
 ran into an oil filter problem 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.280
 started the seller 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:56.950
 so no further torture license 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:02:00.190
 the tool is more than 15 well I think what 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:03.460
 would be twisted no further just 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:22.209
 take the city and see what 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:27.130
 capable of ours everyone was all visible 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:31.120
 our technician broke well and what he broke 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:38.190
 already after we gave him on for 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:50.980
 kilogram just so as not to be unfounded 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:58.480
 just put it mildly with a filter without i think 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:03:02.500
 after such a test any of the filter already 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:10.120
 spun long ago well that is shiva 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:14.350
 just boldly say so very much 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:20.070
 boldly here 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:26.320
 and that he crashed 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:29.620
 okay next pictures I think their conclusion here 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:32.880
 that's what we can do to filter everything 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.880
 filter welded here 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:44.590
 effort well it was already far beyond 15 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.530
 kilogram, too, 15 kilograms I squeeze 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:51.790
 torque wrench and hopefully be 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.320
 can be seen on the video but already 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.000
 attached how much happened 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.560
 how many forces had enough strength and broke 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.910
 puller 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:05.860
 how much is enough 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.750
 how much do you eat chain strength principle 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.140
 here they checked stefan was a two-row 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.750
 how can we do our principle with 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:18.010
 double row chain 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.970
 he could be like this someday 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.650
 check it out 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:28.600
 how much he will you be if there is nothing 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:30.520
 will do that is i think everyone 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:34.270
 I understand everything, thank you for your attention 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.870
 we will conduct crash tests to explain what 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.690
 for what 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:40.270
 Further questions will be written, I hope 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.610
 I will try well, I will try completely 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.990
 answer fully as it is 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.990
 possible as far as possible
