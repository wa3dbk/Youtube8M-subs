game in a huddle true just to show you

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.350 
game in a huddle true just to show you
that<00:00:09.410> how<00:00:09.830> is<00:00:10.040> going<00:00:10.219> to<00:00:10.280> perform<00:00:10.700> in<00:00:11.000> 3d

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:11.360 
that how is going to perform in 3d

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.839 
that how is going to perform in 3d
graphics<00:00:11.840> as<00:00:11.990> well<00:00:12.070> 3d<00:00:13.070> and<00:00:13.190> 2d<00:00:13.220> graphics

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:13.849 
graphics as well 3d and 2d graphics

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.570 
graphics as well 3d and 2d graphics
because<00:00:14.150> as<00:00:14.389> from<00:00:15.170> my<00:00:15.410> benchmark<00:00:15.800> result<00:00:16.400> it

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
because as from my benchmark result it

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.519 
because as from my benchmark result it
showed<00:00:16.790> me<00:00:17.000> that's<00:00:17.210> a<00:00:17.300> pretty<00:00:17.480> good<00:00:17.689> in<00:00:18.080> terms

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:18.529 
showed me that's a pretty good in terms

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:24.340 
showed me that's a pretty good in terms
of<00:00:18.680> that<00:00:18.830> and<00:00:19.570> CPU<00:00:20.570> is<00:00:20.990> a<00:00:21.140> 1.83<00:00:21.880> and<00:00:23.289> it's<00:00:24.289> a

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.350 
of that and CPU is a 1.83 and it's a

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.980 
of that and CPU is a 1.83 and it's a
quad<00:00:24.529> core<00:00:24.770> quad<00:00:25.340> core<00:00:25.670> processor<00:00:26.150> as<00:00:26.300> well<00:00:26.330> or

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
quad core quad core processor as well or

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.650 
quad core quad core processor as well or
by<00:00:27.920> Intel<00:00:28.279> and<00:00:29.680> Ram<00:00:30.680> is<00:00:30.859> 2<00:00:31.100> gigahertz<00:00:31.580> so<00:00:32.059> let's

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
by Intel and Ram is 2 gigahertz so let's

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.420 
by Intel and Ram is 2 gigahertz so let's
perform<00:00:32.870> it<00:00:33.170> let's<00:00:33.379> see<00:00:33.500> how<00:00:33.590> its<00:00:33.769> gonna<00:00:33.920> do<00:00:34.129> is

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
perform it let's see how its gonna do is

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.719 
perform it let's see how its gonna do is
so<00:00:34.729> the<00:00:35.659> game<00:00:35.870> i'm<00:00:36.080> going<00:00:36.320> to<00:00:36.470> use<00:00:37.960> is<00:00:39.729> it's

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:40.729 
so the game i'm going to use is it's

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:43.090 
so the game i'm going to use is it's
very<00:00:40.850> hard<00:00:41.180> to<00:00:41.210> pronounce<00:00:41.390> for<00:00:41.720> me<00:00:41.839> it's<00:00:42.199> it's

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
very hard to pronounce for me it's it's
