00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
start off of course hitting trying to

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.380 
start off of course hitting trying to
hit<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.339> whole<00:01:05.519> song<00:01:05.729> cuz<00:01:05.939> hitting<00:01:06.270> or

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
hit to the whole song cuz hitting or

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.750 
hit to the whole song cuz hitting or
something<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:07.020> just<00:01:07.049> can't<00:01:07.680> get<00:01:08.460> right

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
something that you just can't get right

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.390 
something that you just can't get right
off<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.119> bat<00:01:09.299> like<00:01:10.049> maybe<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.650> sound<00:01:10.979> isolation

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
off the bat like maybe a sound isolation

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.670 
off the bat like maybe a sound isolation
once<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.150> get<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.600> get<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.840> but<00:01:13.500> hitting

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
once you get it you get it but hitting

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.490 
once you get it you get it but hitting
it<00:01:13.979> takes<00:01:14.189> time<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:15.750> develop<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.140> muscle

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
it takes time and to develop the muscle

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.410 
it takes time and to develop the muscle
so<00:01:16.680> hitting<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.430> always<00:01:17.880> going<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.210> be<00:01:18.240> your

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
so hitting is always going to be your

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.100 
just going to do popping and then you're
just<00:01:53.579> going<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.880> do<00:01:54.030> waving<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.689> popping<00:01:55.079> just

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
just going to do waving and popping just

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.569 
just going to do waving and popping just
going<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.649> do<00:01:55.740> tutting<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.280> then<00:01:56.430> you're<00:01:56.549> just

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
going to do tutting and then you're just

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:57.950 
going to do tutting and then you're just
going<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.880> do<00:01:56.969> tutting<00:01:57.270> we're<00:01:57.420> popping<00:01:57.810> and

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
going to do tutting we're popping and

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.719 
going to do tutting we're popping and
then<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:58.530> go<00:01:58.680> just<00:01:58.979> don't<00:01:59.310> try<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.579> do

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
then you go just don't try to do

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.490 
then you go just don't try to do
everything<00:01:59.909> while<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.390> once<00:02:00.689> cuz<00:02:00.930> you're<00:02:01.380> going

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
everything while I once cuz you're going

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.709 
everything while I once cuz you're going
to<00:02:01.560> wind<00:02:01.770> up<00:02:01.950> doing<00:02:02.549> whatever<00:02:02.880> moves<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.360> know

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
to wind up doing whatever moves you know

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.620 
to wind up doing whatever moves you know
then<00:02:04.320> creating<00:02:05.100> new<00:02:05.490> stuff<00:02:05.880> or<00:02:06.119> developing

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
then creating new stuff or developing

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.010 
then creating new stuff or developing
new<00:02:06.979> style<00:02:07.979> or<00:02:08.220> technique<00:02:08.250> so<00:02:09.090> forcing

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
new style or technique so forcing

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.110 
new style or technique so forcing
yourself<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.410> do<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:10.830> one<00:02:11.190> star<00:02:11.760> when<00:02:12.000> you're

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
yourself to do that one star when you're

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.880 
yourself to do that one star when you're
practicing<00:02:12.330> will<00:02:12.900> force<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:13.500> to

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
practicing will force you to

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.070 
practicing will force you to
more<00:02:14.100> creative<00:02:14.700> with<00:02:14.880> that<00:02:15.150> particular<00:02:15.480> style

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
more creative with that particular style

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.440 
more creative with that particular style
or<00:02:16.350> technique<00:02:16.620> so<00:02:17.550> think<00:02:17.760> about<00:02:17.880> that<00:02:17.970> so

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
or technique so think about that so

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.170 
or technique so think about that so
what's<00:02:19.230> a<00:02:19.500> good<00:02:19.709> guideline<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.400> practice<00:02:20.940> I

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
what's a good guideline to practice I

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.090 
what's a good guideline to practice I
would<00:02:21.540> start<00:02:21.900> out<00:02:22.020> with<00:02:22.230> this<00:02:22.380> time<00:02:22.590> I'm<00:02:22.740> music

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
would start out with this time I'm music

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.820 
would start out with this time I'm music
one<00:02:23.730> whole<00:02:24.060> song<00:02:24.390> try<00:02:24.720> to<00:02:24.780> pick<00:02:24.959> the<00:02:25.080> long<00:02:25.350> long

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
one whole song try to pick the long long

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.190 
one whole song try to pick the long long
song<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.580> then<00:02:27.090> it's<00:02:27.450> good<00:02:27.660> practice<00:02:27.840> hitting

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
song and then it's good practice hitting

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.590 
song and then it's good practice hitting
after<00:02:29.069> that<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:29.850> want<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.150> take<00:02:30.300> a<00:02:30.330> break

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
after that you want to take a break

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.900 
after that you want to take a break
taking<00:02:31.050> a<00:02:31.110> break<00:02:31.350> mean<00:02:31.620> not<00:02:31.980> sitting<00:02:32.370> down<00:02:32.400> but

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
taking a break mean not sitting down but

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.370 
taking a break mean not sitting down but
they're<00:02:33.060> not<00:02:33.300> hitting<00:02:33.780> let<00:02:33.930> your<00:02:34.050> muscle

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
they're not hitting let your muscle

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.010 
they're not hitting let your muscle
relax<00:02:34.709> maybe<00:02:35.220> do<00:02:35.459> a<00:02:35.490> little<00:02:35.580> bit<00:02:35.970> of<00:02:36.020> waving

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
relax maybe do a little bit of waving

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.150 
relax maybe do a little bit of waving
which<00:02:37.290> is<00:02:37.410> gonna<00:02:37.590> be<00:02:37.709> good<00:02:37.890> because<00:02:38.040> you're

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
which is gonna be good because you're

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.150 
which is gonna be good because you're
not<00:02:38.310> really<00:02:38.550> tensing<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:39.540> hitting<00:02:39.750> any<00:02:39.870> more

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
not really tensing and hitting any more

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.550 
not really tensing and hitting any more
after<00:02:41.160> that<00:02:41.400> my<00:02:42.090> recommendation<00:02:42.360> is<00:02:43.020> combined

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
after that my recommendation is combined

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.080 
after that my recommendation is combined
and<00:02:43.770> hitting<00:02:43.980> and<00:02:44.160> waving<00:02:44.670> so<00:02:44.819> you<00:02:44.910> get<00:02:45.060> a

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
and hitting and waving so you get a

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.410 
and hitting and waving so you get a
taste<00:02:45.390> of<00:02:45.750> what<00:02:46.200> you<00:02:46.350> just<00:02:46.590> kind<00:02:46.950> of

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
taste of what you just kind of

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.220 
taste of what you just kind of
experiment<00:02:48.420> or<00:02:48.570> whatever<00:02:48.810> with<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.020> waves

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
experiment or whatever with the waves

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.260 
experiment or whatever with the waves
with<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.590> head<00:02:49.860> and<00:02:50.070> then<00:02:50.760> take<00:02:51.060> a<00:02:51.090> little

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
with the head and then take a little

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.509 
with the head and then take a little
break<00:02:51.570> then<00:02:51.900> maybe<00:02:52.230> get<00:02:52.410> into<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.709> tutting<00:02:53.100> or

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
break then maybe get into the tutting or

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.759 
break then maybe get into the tutting or
whatever<00:02:53.940> you<00:02:54.060> want<00:02:54.239> to<00:02:54.269> do<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:54.690> then<00:02:55.260> after

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
whatever you want to do and then after

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.830 
whatever you want to do and then after
all<00:02:55.800> of<00:02:55.950> that<00:02:56.100> is<00:02:56.370> very<00:02:56.910> important<00:02:57.450> just<00:02:57.600> sit

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
all of that is very important just sit

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.350 
all of that is very important just sit
down<00:02:57.870> and<00:02:58.290> just<00:02:58.500> think<00:02:58.800> about<00:02:59.030> create<00:03:00.030> some

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
down and just think about create some

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.720 
down and just think about create some
new<00:03:00.530> concept<00:03:01.530> or<00:03:01.650> new<00:03:01.830> movement<00:03:02.489> and<00:03:02.610> with

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
new concept or new movement and with

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.850 
new concept or new movement and with
your<00:03:02.880> popping<00:03:03.360> even<00:03:03.750> though<00:03:03.930> if<00:03:04.170> it's<00:03:04.350> wack<00:03:04.590> or

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
your popping even though if it's wack or

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.229 
your popping even though if it's wack or
doesn't<00:03:05.130> matter<00:03:05.280> because<00:03:05.459> this<00:03:05.550> is<00:03:05.790> you<00:03:06.030> at

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
doesn't matter because this is you at

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.000 
doesn't matter because this is you at
home<00:03:06.420> that's<00:03:06.690> why<00:03:06.840> most<00:03:07.080> of<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.380> popping<00:03:07.830> and

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
home that's why most of the popping and

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.210 
home that's why most of the popping and
creativity<00:03:08.459> should<00:03:08.940> be<00:03:09.060> done<00:03:09.300> at<00:03:09.540> home<00:03:10.220> by

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
creativity should be done at home by

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.240 
creativity should be done at home by
yourself<00:03:11.600> not<00:03:12.600> a<00:03:12.630> group<00:03:13.110> but<00:03:13.530> at<00:03:13.650> home<00:03:13.920> by

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
yourself not a group but at home by

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.190 
yourself not a group but at home by
yourself<00:03:14.280> when<00:03:15.209> nobody<00:03:15.239> is<00:03:15.600> watching<00:03:15.660> that's

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
yourself when nobody is watching that's

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.410 
yourself when nobody is watching that's
when<00:03:16.350> you're<00:03:16.470> gonna<00:03:16.530> be<00:03:16.650> most<00:03:17.280> pure<00:03:17.790> within

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
when you're gonna be most pure within

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.759 
when you're gonna be most pure within
yourself<00:03:18.930> and<00:03:19.049> you're<00:03:19.200> not<00:03:19.320> going<00:03:19.470> to<00:03:19.530> lie<00:03:19.739> to

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
yourself and you're not going to lie to

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.350 
yourself and you're not going to lie to
yourself<00:03:20.310> you're<00:03:20.430> not<00:03:20.579> going<00:03:20.820> to<00:03:20.880> try<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.060> show

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
yourself you're not going to try to show

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.819 
yourself you're not going to try to show
off<00:03:21.570> you're<00:03:22.140> going<00:03:22.290> to<00:03:22.350> try<00:03:22.440> to<00:03:22.470> do<00:03:22.620> something

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
off you're going to try to do something

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:24.770 
off you're going to try to do something
different<00:03:22.950> so<00:03:23.790> that's<00:03:24.150> a<00:03:24.360> little<00:03:24.450> bit<00:03:24.660> of<00:03:24.750> a

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
different so that's a little bit of a

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.259 
different so that's a little bit of a
tip<00:03:25.049> on<00:03:25.230> how<00:03:25.530> to<00:03:25.560> practice<00:03:26.220> later<00:03:26.970> on<00:03:27.120> I'm

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
tip on how to practice later on I'm

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:28.699 
tip on how to practice later on I'm
going<00:03:27.299> to<00:03:27.510> try<00:03:27.630> to<00:03:27.660> explain<00:03:27.989> other<00:03:28.200> techniques

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
going to try to explain other techniques

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.280 
going to try to explain other techniques
on<00:03:28.950> what<00:03:29.700> to<00:03:29.850> do<00:03:30.030> or<00:03:30.329> just<00:03:30.360> maybe<00:03:30.720> a<00:03:30.840> little<00:03:31.049> bit

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
on what to do or just maybe a little bit

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.319 
on what to do or just maybe a little bit
of<00:03:31.410> a<00:03:31.440> different<00:03:32.040> approach<00:03:32.730> to<00:03:33.000> whatever

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
of a different approach to whatever

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.180 
of a different approach to whatever
style<00:03:33.540> but<00:03:33.840> right<00:03:33.959> now<00:03:34.140> this<00:03:34.320> is<00:03:34.440> a<00:03:34.530> good<00:03:34.709> basic

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
style but right now this is a good basic

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.329 
style but right now this is a good basic
