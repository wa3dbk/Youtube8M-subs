00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.509
 Hi, I'm Mariana again and good day 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.189
 yesterday I had uploaded a video in which 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.589
 tea bags are made in the form of 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.420
 heart to give away the people who 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:14.580
 they saw this video they told me that 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.280
 they wanted something to give to their boyfriend 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.710
 girlfriend or give a detail to whom you 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.890
 want I did a craft again 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.990
 which is the bottle of memories in this 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.200
 case is a vase can occupy 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.940
 any glass jar that does 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.500
 can you look inward because you 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.870
 flame of memories because we're going to have 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.739
 our favorite pictures within 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.530
 him and we can place it as an ornament 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.170
 room fourth or as you want and 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.300
 give it to whoever you want or who 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.480
 can this be this bottle or is it a 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.609
 florerito for our boyfriend dad or a 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.280
 Uncle Grandpa can be a jar of 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:56.149
 beer and for our friend I would 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.550
 I recommend a nice little bit of kingfisher ok 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.720
 so, come on, what I did, let's go 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.820
 start 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.160
 What I did was make a collage in 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.460
 super nice power point of the photos 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:12.390
 what I like most and well I calculated more or 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.280
 less the width and length of the bottle that 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.160
 I was going to use it really did not fit me 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.380
 perfect because I had a spare space 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.110
 worry if you have a spare space what 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.020
 they can fix putting another letter or 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.240
 putting a poem what you want 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.630
 you can fix that space that is not 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.060
 as necessary to make it perfect ok 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.820
 then the only thing we are going to do is not 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.060
 we are going to double our photographs but 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.380
 it's just going to take the shape of the neck of 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.380
 our vase ok 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.409
 there is 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.390
 ok then it was super good was 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.460
 right but you can do it from 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.799
 side or as you want to see 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.840
 the photographs also what they serve 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.869
 these jars of photos is that sometimes 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.850
 we are fat people and we want 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.310
 see the one here or we do not want to see 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.440
 totally to this and we can like fold 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.250
 the photo or cut it out or do what 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.009
 want 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:14.580
 so I decided to decorate the 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.580
 neck of the bottle to see there is 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.800
 it was with serpentine then I took three 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.250
 colors are what you want 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.250
 drink 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.310
 ok here are two and we're just going to surround the 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.700
 neck of the bottle or bottle that 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:36.500
 we are going to use it is very important that 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.500
 only make you a unique 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.310
 and it looks like super nice then there 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.560
 is the bottle adorned and if you can 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.050
 countdown come as the 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.470
 Serpentine caireles that we use 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.720
 they can choose only two colors or they can 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.090
 choose several can decorate it with 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.450
 strips with whatever you want 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.959
 Decorate the chicken in the bottle 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.510
 ok and there is now finished what 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.849
 I made for the martini glass is very 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.349
 important that the photo that we go to 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.300
 to be small 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.849
 now this picture if you have to stop it 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.470
 with something in this case I put tape 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:18.780
 white because these ways are not going to 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.400
 noticing you can be set free or what 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.010
 this is so that we do not have the 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.380
 photograph or when giving the gift 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:29.130
 can leave the photo or move a lot 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:32.420
 less ok then there is the picture what 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:37.260
 what did I do in this in this martini glass 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.950
 ok was how to put several plumitas 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.680
 colors 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.410
 that is super easy to do can 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.739
 find the pens in things for 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.420
 crafts or what you want 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.900
 so it is important that they combine 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:56.040
 the colors 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:58.019
 to make it look super nice and look 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.049
 combinable or if you want to do it from a 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:03.870
 just good color does not matter then the 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:08.420
 We are going to fill little by little 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.420
 colourful feathers 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.989
 and we're going to put them in there then we have 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.010
 and dram 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:22.010
