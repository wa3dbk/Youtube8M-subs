00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
are some chords that go with it so I'm

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.479 
are some chords that go with it so I'm
gonna<00:00:36.570> cover<00:00:36.750> those<00:00:36.989> two<00:00:37.260> now<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.950> couple<00:00:38.370> of

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
gonna cover those two now a couple of

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.049 
gonna cover those two now a couple of
things<00:00:38.670> before<00:00:38.940> we<00:00:39.180> get<00:00:39.450> started<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:40.230> were

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
things before we get started that were

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.750 
things before we get started that were
mystifying<00:00:42.059> confusing<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:43.140> me<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.760> suspect

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
mystifying confusing to me I suspect

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.319 
mystifying confusing to me I suspect
that<00:00:45.030> there<00:00:45.510> are<00:00:45.660> two<00:00:46.050> guitars<00:00:47.329> simultaneous

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
that there are two guitars simultaneous

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.690 
that there are two guitars simultaneous
on<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.780> recording<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:50.070> other<00:00:50.190> thing<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.579> I

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
on the recording the other thing is I

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.029 
on the recording the other thing is I
suspect<00:00:50.989> that<00:00:51.989> whoever<00:00:52.289> played<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.890> guitar

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
suspect that whoever played that guitar

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.729 
suspect that whoever played that guitar
part<00:00:53.760> may<00:00:54.449> have<00:00:54.480> played<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.320> with<00:00:55.500> their

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
part may have played it with their

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.150 
part may have played it with their
fingers<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.610> not<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.000> pic<00:00:57.300> okay<00:00:58.020> so<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.890> want<00:00:59.100> to

fingers and not a pic okay so I want to
put<00:00:59.280> those<00:00:59.489> disclaimers<00:01:00.149> out<00:01:00.270> there<00:01:00.449> first

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
put those disclaimers out there first

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
the actual recording so I wouldn't play

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.219 
the actual recording so I wouldn't play
it<00:01:46.490> and<00:01:47.490> then<00:01:48.060> we<00:01:48.180> go<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.630> next<00:01:48.960> chord

it and then we go to the next chord
which<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:49.710> essentially<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.759> B<00:01:51.180> major<00:01:51.869> bard

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
which is essentially a B major bard

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.480 
which is essentially a B major bard
based<00:01:53.579> on<00:01:53.759> an<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:54.180> open<00:01:54.689> okay<00:01:55.350> but<00:01:55.950> instead<00:01:56.430> of

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
based on an a open okay but instead of

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.069 
based on an a open okay but instead of
doing<00:01:56.700> all<00:01:56.939> this<00:01:57.149> business<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.719> then<00:01:57.810> trying
