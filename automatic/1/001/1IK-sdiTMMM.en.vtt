youtube and i think i've actually heard

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.849 
youtube and i think i've actually heard
this<00:00:18.390> somewhere<00:00:18.539> else<00:00:18.720> before<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:20.300> where<00:00:21.859> they

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
this somewhere else before to where they

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.189 
this somewhere else before to where they
can<00:00:22.920> block<00:00:23.310> this<00:00:23.550> flower<00:00:23.820> power<00:00:24.150> tag<00:00:24.600> cancel

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
can block this flower power tag cancel

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.140 
can block this flower power tag cancel
mix<00:00:25.410> up<00:00:25.590> just<00:00:25.830> by<00:00:25.949> holding<00:00:26.130> down<00:00:26.400> back<00:00:26.789> or<00:00:27.119> just

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
mix up just by holding down back or just

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.750 
mix up just by holding down back or just
blocking<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.410> direction<00:00:28.920> that<00:00:29.099> they<00:00:29.369> came<00:00:29.550> in

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
blocking the direction that they came in

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.790 
blocking the direction that they came in
originally<00:00:31.640> that<00:00:32.640> can<00:00:32.880> work<00:00:33.059> on<00:00:33.500> but<00:00:34.500> there's

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
originally that can work on but there's

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.220 
originally that can work on but there's
some<00:00:35.040> trickery<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.550> can<00:00:35.760> do<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.239> fuck<00:00:37.050> with

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
some trickery you can do to fuck with

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.270 
some trickery you can do to fuck with
that<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:38.250> make<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.550> not<00:00:38.640> work<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.890> the<00:00:40.890> the

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
that to make it not work and the the

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.430 
that to make it not work and the the
trick<00:00:41.489> all<00:00:42.149> right<00:00:42.329> i<00:00:42.480> did<00:00:42.750> i<00:00:43.079> just<00:00:43.110> kind<00:00:43.410> of

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
trick all right i did i just kind of

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.200 
trick all right i did i just kind of
want<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.620> explain<00:00:44.010> how<00:00:44.640> this<00:00:44.850> has<00:00:45.030> worked

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
want to explain how this has worked

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.760 
want to explain how this has worked
because<00:00:45.480> i<00:00:45.690> have<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.870> better<00:00:46.020> understanding<00:00:46.170> of

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
because i have a better understanding of

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.939 
because i have a better understanding of
it<00:00:46.890> now<00:00:47.899> so<00:00:48.899> when<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.829> do<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.129> flower<00:00:50.399> power

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
it now so when you do this flower power

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.350 
it now so when you do this flower power
the<00:00:52.949> move<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.280> designed<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:53.940> they're<00:00:54.239> in

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
the move is designed so that they're in

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.119 
the move is designed so that they're in
blocks<00:00:54.660> them<00:00:54.960> for<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.260> duration<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.949> that

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
blocks them for the duration of that

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.549 
blocks them for the duration of that
move<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:57.149> engine<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.719> programmed<00:00:58.260> in<00:00:58.469> a

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
move and the engine is programmed in a

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.650 
move and the engine is programmed in a
way<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.949> where<00:00:59.129> if<00:00:59.430> you're<00:00:59.670> in<00:00:59.910> blocks<00:01:00.329> done

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
way that where if you're in blocks done

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.880 
way that where if you're in blocks done
for<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.020> move<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:02.309> get<00:01:02.520> hips<00:01:02.820> um<00:01:03.830> i'm<00:01:04.830> not

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
for a move and you get hips um i'm not

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.890 
for a move and you get hips um i'm not
sure<00:01:05.070> if<00:01:05.339> this<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.519> just<00:01:05.670> for<00:01:06.090> this<00:01:06.210> tag<00:01:06.450> cancel

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
sure if this is just for this tag cancel

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.390 
sure if this is just for this tag cancel
but<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.290> definitely<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.950> way<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.189> works

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
but this is definitely the way it works

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.350 
but this is definitely the way it works
while<00:01:09.360> you're<00:01:09.600> in<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:10.189> block<00:01:11.189> stone<00:01:12.710> as<00:01:14.360> long

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
while you're in this block stone as long

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.090 
while you're in this block stone as long
as<00:01:15.390> you're<00:01:15.720> blocking<00:01:16.229> away<00:01:16.500> from<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.890> place

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
as you're blocking away from the place

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.679 
as you're blocking away from the place
where<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.460> originated<00:01:17.939> you're<00:01:18.420> going<00:01:18.600> to

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
where it originated you're going to

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.690 
where it originated you're going to
block<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.080> whole<00:01:19.259> thing<00:01:19.530> but<00:01:20.070> i<00:01:20.130> found<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.580> way

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
block the whole thing but i found a way

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.289 
block the whole thing but i found a way
to<00:01:20.759> get<00:01:20.939> around<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.500> um<00:01:22.850> so<00:01:23.850> i'm<00:01:23.970> just<00:01:24.000> going<00:01:24.240> to

alright<00:02:00.010> I'm<00:02:00.100> going<00:02:00.190> to<00:02:00.280> turn<00:02:00.400> on<00:02:00.490> inputs<00:02:00.910> to

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
alright I'm going to turn on inputs to

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.180 
alright I'm going to turn on inputs to
see<00:02:03.760> that<00:02:03.880> should<00:02:04.030> be<00:02:04.120> on

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
see that should be on

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:17.580 
see that should be on
okay<00:02:15.300> hold<00:02:16.300> still<00:02:16.540> waiting<00:02:16.780> on<00:02:16.930> back<00:02:17.200> Jerry

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
okay hold still waiting on back Jerry

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
crossing over not getting there um so it

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.170 
crossing over not getting there um so it
actually<00:02:21.160> is<00:02:21.370> a<00:02:21.430> matter<00:02:21.580> what<00:02:21.760> side<00:02:21.940> you're<00:02:22.120> on

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
actually is a matter what side you're on

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.060 
actually is a matter what side you're on
because<00:02:22.570> of<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:22.900> way<00:02:23.050> that<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.410> tag<00:02:23.620> cancel

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
because of the way that the tag cancel

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.640 
because of the way that the tag cancel
thing<00:02:24.220> works<00:02:24.490> um<00:02:24.760> and<00:02:25.720> even<00:02:26.320> if<00:02:26.440> you<00:02:26.560> try<00:02:26.950> to

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
thing works um and even if you try to

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.280 
thing works um and even if you try to
kind<00:02:29.650> of<00:02:29.770> do<00:02:29.920> shit<00:02:30.160> with<00:02:30.940> jury<00:02:31.240> like<00:02:31.660> attack<00:02:31.990> it

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
kind of do shit with jury like attack it

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:49.920 
kind of do shit with jury like attack it
might<00:02:32.500> not<00:02:32.680> always<00:02:32.920> work<00:02:48.330> that<00:02:49.330> whole<00:02:49.540> string

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
might not always work that whole string

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.390 
might not always work that whole string
I<00:02:50.080> should<00:02:50.320> be<00:02:50.440> able<00:02:50.530> to<00:02:50.710> block<00:02:50.920> just<00:02:51.220> by

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
I should be able to block just by

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.070 
I should be able to block just by
holding<00:02:51.550> down<00:02:51.760> back<00:02:52.180> even<00:02:52.750> though<00:02:52.840> some<00:02:53.050> of

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
holding down back even though some of

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.510 
holding down back even though some of
them<00:02:53.260> were<00:02:53.380> jumping<00:02:53.770> attacks<00:02:54.070> which<00:02:54.310> should

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
them were jumping attacks which should

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:01.720 
them were jumping attacks which should
have<00:02:54.730> to<00:02:54.850> be<00:02:54.970> blocked<00:02:55.180> over<00:02:55.390> them

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.860 

all<00:03:02.730> right<00:03:02.849> so<00:03:03.000> that<00:03:03.150> last<00:03:03.330> hit<00:03:03.510> me<00:03:03.659> that's

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
all right so that last hit me that's

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.729 
all right so that last hit me that's
that's<00:03:04.140> after<00:03:04.319> shell<00:03:04.590> leaves<00:03:04.830> so<00:03:05.959> even<00:03:06.959> if<00:03:07.080> it

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
that's after shell leaves so even if it

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.470 
that's after shell leaves so even if it
doesn't<00:03:07.980> really<00:03:08.280> fit<00:03:08.760> there's<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.060> trick<00:03:09.299> to<00:03:09.330> it

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
doesn't really fit there's a trick to it

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.240 
doesn't really fit there's a trick to it
and<00:03:10.290> it's<00:03:10.500> not<00:03:10.680> immediately<00:03:12.890> in<00:03:13.890> order<00:03:13.980> to

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
and it's not immediately in order to

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.640 
and it's not immediately in order to
block<00:03:14.549> or<00:03:14.909> in<00:03:15.060> order<00:03:15.269> to<00:03:15.360> force<00:03:15.659> them<00:03:15.900> to<00:03:15.930> block

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
block or in order to force them to block

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.130 
block or in order to force them to block
this<00:03:16.860> and<00:03:17.129> this<00:03:17.310> can<00:03:17.519> actually<00:03:17.700> almost<00:03:18.660> be

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
this and this can actually almost be

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.610 
this and this can actually almost be
unblockable<00:03:19.769> if<00:03:19.950> you<00:03:20.069> do<00:03:20.250> this<00:03:20.400> right<00:03:21.620> you

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
unblockable if you do this right you

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.100 
unblockable if you do this right you
have<00:03:22.830> to<00:03:22.980> interrupt<00:03:23.310> a<00:03:23.670> block<00:03:23.940> done<00:03:24.330> from<00:03:24.930> one

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
have to interrupt a block done from one

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.289 
have to interrupt a block done from one
of<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.290> flower<00:03:25.500> powers<00:03:25.980> with<00:03:26.849> a<00:03:26.879> move<00:03:27.120> that

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
of the flower powers with a move that

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.979 
of the flower powers with a move that
has<00:03:27.360> left<00:03:28.110> slock<00:03:28.470> stunts<00:03:28.829> and<00:03:29.629> then<00:03:30.629> hit<00:03:30.870> them

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
has left slock stunts and then hit them

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.229 
has left slock stunts and then hit them
again<00:03:31.140> our<00:03:32.069> force<00:03:32.489> them<00:03:32.670> to<00:03:32.700> change<00:03:33.030> where

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
again our force them to change where

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.449 
again our force them to change where
they're<00:03:33.360> blocking<00:03:33.569> before<00:03:34.230> when<00:03:34.980> I<00:03:35.010> Jose<00:03:35.280> hits

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
they're blocking before when I Jose hits

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:44.559 
they're blocking before when I Jose hits
comes<00:03:35.790> in<00:03:36.349> so<00:03:37.349> it<00:03:37.890> will<00:03:38.310> kind<00:03:38.640> of<00:03:38.760> like<00:03:38.940> this

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.140 

you<00:03:45.569> do<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.840> kicks<00:03:46.230> too<00:03:46.410> fast<00:03:46.760> it'll<00:03:47.760> little

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
you do the kicks too fast it'll little

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.050 
you do the kicks too fast it'll little
fuck<00:03:48.299> it<00:03:48.420> up<00:03:49.250> so<00:03:50.250> I'm<00:03:50.340> not<00:03:50.430> sure<00:03:50.489> if<00:03:50.670> I<00:03:50.819> did<00:03:50.970> it

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
fuck it up so I'm not sure if I did it

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.539 
fuck it up so I'm not sure if I did it
right<00:03:51.150> there<00:03:51.390> but<00:03:51.540> we'll<00:03:51.660> find<00:03:51.810> out<00:03:52.430> so<00:03:53.430> I'm

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
right there but we'll find out so I'm

00:03:53.549 --> 00:04:00.820 
right there but we'll find out so I'm
just<00:03:53.700> going<00:03:53.849> to<00:03:53.910> hold<00:03:54.060> down<00:03:54.180> back

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:12.900 

yeah<00:04:01.340> I<00:04:01.370> didn't<00:04:01.760> do<00:04:01.850> fast<00:04:02.150> young

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.850 

even<00:04:13.910> sure<00:04:14.090> if<00:04:14.180> I<00:04:14.240> got<00:04:14.420> it<00:04:14.510> there<00:04:14.690> it's<00:04:15.560> pretty

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
even sure if I got it there it's pretty

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.400 
even sure if I got it there it's pretty
tricky<00:04:16.450> essentially<00:04:17.450> what<00:04:17.630> is<00:04:17.870> important<00:04:18.350> to

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
tricky essentially what is important to

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.720 
tricky essentially what is important to
know<00:04:18.560> though<00:04:18.769> is<00:04:19.010> that<00:04:19.040> your<00:04:19.310> best<00:04:19.459> way<00:04:19.670> to

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
know though is that your best way to

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.120 
know though is that your best way to
fuck<00:04:19.970> people<00:04:20.000> up<00:04:20.360> if<00:04:20.840> they<00:04:21.049> show<00:04:21.769> you<00:04:21.830> that

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
fuck people up if they show you that

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:28.260 
fuck people up if they show you that
they<00:04:22.280> can<00:04:22.460> block<00:04:22.670> this<00:04:22.910> is<00:04:23.150> to<00:04:23.660> do<00:04:23.870> these<00:04:27.220> show

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
they can block this is to do these show

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:41.929 
they can block this is to do these show
I<00:04:29.270> think<00:04:30.230> I<00:04:30.290> got<00:04:30.440> a<00:04:30.470> hit<00:04:30.650> in<00:04:30.770> there<00:04:30.920> by<00:04:33.220> 11

00:04:41.929 --> 00:04:41.939 

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:45.479 

yeah<00:04:42.939> actually<00:04:43.179> I<00:04:43.769> actually<00:04:44.769> do<00:04:45.069> hit<00:04:45.249> him<00:04:45.399> but

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:45.489 
yeah actually I actually do hit him but

00:04:45.489 --> 00:04:46.619 
yeah actually I actually do hit him but
it<00:04:45.609> doesn't<00:04:45.819> go<00:04:45.909> into<00:04:46.029> the<00:04:46.149> combo<00:04:46.479> because

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:46.629 
it doesn't go into the combo because

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:49.709 
it doesn't go into the combo because
he's<00:04:46.869> still<00:04:47.079> blocking<00:04:47.349> gone<00:04:47.679> back<00:04:47.949> so<00:04:48.539> when<00:04:49.539> he

00:04:49.709 --> 00:04:49.719 
he's still blocking gone back so when he

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:51.839 
he's still blocking gone back so when he
when<00:04:49.989> you<00:04:50.079> go<00:04:50.259> into<00:04:50.499> the<00:04:50.769> tag<00:04:50.979> cancel<00:04:51.549> the

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:51.849 
when you go into the tag cancel the

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:54.449 
when you go into the tag cancel the
mechanic<00:04:52.389> safe<00:04:52.719> as<00:04:52.959> long<00:04:53.379> as<00:04:53.799> he's<00:04:54.009> in<00:04:54.039> blocks

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:54.459 
mechanic safe as long as he's in blocks

00:04:54.459 --> 00:04:55.919 
mechanic safe as long as he's in blocks
tongue<00:04:54.759> from<00:04:55.029> the<00:04:55.179> move<00:04:55.359> that<00:04:55.569> was<00:04:55.689> tag

tongue from the move that was tag
cancelled<00:04:56.429> it<00:04:57.429> doesn't<00:04:57.789> matter<00:04:57.879> where<00:04:58.269> you're

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
cancelled it doesn't matter where you're

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:00.379

hitting<00:04:58.599> him<00:04:58.869> from<00:04:59.139> he's<00:04:59.409> going<00:04:59.619> to<00:04:59.679> be<00:04:59.799> safe

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
hitting him from he's going to be safe

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:03.299 
hitting him from he's going to be safe
that<00:05:01.389> rule<00:05:01.749> breaks<00:05:02.109> as<00:05:02.409> soon<00:05:02.739> as<00:05:02.889> he<00:05:03.039> leaves

that rule breaks as soon as he leaves

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:07.109 
that rule breaks as soon as he leaves
blocks<00:05:03.879> done<00:05:04.919> for<00:05:05.919> example<00:05:06.369> from<00:05:06.609> one<00:05:06.999> of

blocks done for example from one of
Jerry's<00:05:07.419> shorts<00:05:07.839> because<00:05:08.049> if<00:05:08.679> you<00:05:08.859> hit<00:05:09.069> him

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:09.579 
Jerry's shorts because if you hit him

00:05:09.579 --> 00:05:12.239 
Jerry's shorts because if you hit him

you've let the hip of the blocks down

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:33.119 
you've let the hip of the blocks down
from<00:05:30.069> the<00:05:30.489> original<00:05:31.179> tag<00:05:31.419> cancelled<00:05:31.719> move<00:05:32.139> so

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:33.129 
from the original tag cancelled move so

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:34.619 
from the original tag cancelled move so
that's<00:05:33.309> kind<00:05:33.519> of<00:05:33.579> the<00:05:33.639> mechanics<00:05:34.179> behind<00:05:34.359> how

00:05:34.619 --> 00:05:34.629 
that's kind of the mechanics behind how

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:37.439 
that's kind of the mechanics behind how
this<00:05:34.959> works<00:05:35.289> um<00:05:35.849> it's<00:05:36.849> going<00:05:36.939> to<00:05:37.089> be<00:05:37.209> hard

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:37.449 
this works um it's going to be hard

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:39.389 
this works um it's going to be hard
against<00:05:38.109> somebody<00:05:38.349> who<00:05:38.589> knows<00:05:38.799> how<00:05:38.859> to<00:05:39.039> block

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:39.399 
against somebody who knows how to block

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:41.099 
against somebody who knows how to block
it<00:05:39.609> if<00:05:39.759> they<00:05:39.879> just<00:05:40.059> know<00:05:40.239> to<00:05:40.299> hold<00:05:40.629> down<00:05:40.779> back

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:41.109 
it if they just know to hold down back

00:05:41.109 --> 00:05:43.019 
it if they just know to hold down back
or<00:05:41.379> whatever<00:05:41.679> it's<00:05:42.309> going<00:05:42.459> to<00:05:42.549> be<00:05:42.669> hard<00:05:42.879> to

00:05:43.019 --> 00:05:43.029 
or whatever it's going to be hard to

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:46.249 
or whatever it's going to be hard to
open<00:05:43.179> them<00:05:43.449> up<00:05:43.569> but<00:05:43.929> if<00:05:44.049> you<00:05:44.139> do<00:05:44.289> these<00:05:44.469> short

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:46.259 
open them up but if you do these short

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:48.989 
open them up but if you do these short
short<00:05:47.259> strings<00:05:47.799> just<00:05:48.099> trying<00:05:48.669> to<00:05:48.759> interrupt

00:05:48.989 --> 00:05:48.999 
short strings just trying to interrupt

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:50.759 
short strings just trying to interrupt
the<00:05:49.269> box<00:05:49.479> then<00:05:49.749> you<00:05:49.869> can<00:05:50.079> open<00:05:50.379> them<00:05:50.529> up<00:05:50.589> with

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:50.769 
the box then you can open them up with

00:05:50.769 --> 00:05:53.249 
the box then you can open them up with
it<00:05:50.889> still<00:05:51.129> it's<00:05:51.969> not<00:05:52.119> totally<00:05:52.569> useless<00:05:52.599> but

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:53.259 
it still it's not totally useless but

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:54.809 
it still it's not totally useless but
it's<00:05:53.499> not<00:05:53.739> as<00:05:53.889> good<00:05:54.039> as<00:05:54.129> I<00:05:54.219> first<00:05:54.459> thought<00:05:54.579> it

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:54.819 
it's not as good as I first thought it

00:05:54.819 --> 00:05:56.339 
it's not as good as I first thought it
was<00:05:54.969> because<00:05:55.149> I<00:05:55.299> was<00:05:55.569> incorrect<00:05:56.019> in<00:05:56.199> that

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:56.349 
was because I was incorrect in that

00:05:56.349 --> 00:05:57.899 
was because I was incorrect in that
first<00:05:56.559> video<00:05:56.739> saying<00:05:57.159> that<00:05:57.339> it<00:05:57.429> matter<00:05:57.610> what

00:05:57.899 --> 00:05:57.909 
first video saying that it matter what

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:00.149 
first video saying that it matter what
side<00:05:58.149> you're<00:05:58.360> on<00:05:58.889> so<00:05:59.889> that's<00:06:00.069> a<00:06:00.129> really

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:00.159 
side you're on so that's a really

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:02.369 
side you're on so that's a really
complicated<00:06:00.819> explanation<00:06:01.779> for<00:06:02.049> why<00:06:02.319> this

00:06:02.369 --> 00:06:02.379 
complicated explanation for why this

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:03.979 
complicated explanation for why this
doesn't<00:06:02.739> work<00:06:03.009> the<00:06:03.219> way<00:06:03.249> i<00:06:03.369> thought<00:06:03.610> it<00:06:03.729> was

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:03.989 
doesn't work the way i thought it was

00:06:03.989 --> 00:06:07.979 
doesn't work the way i thought it was
working<00:06:04.989> before<00:06:05.110> but<00:06:05.769> how<00:06:06.179> but<00:06:07.179> it<00:06:07.659> is<00:06:07.809> still

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:07.989 
working before but how but it is still

00:06:07.989 --> 00:06:10.079 
working before but how but it is still
useful<00:06:08.229> especially<00:06:09.159> because<00:06:09.699> people<00:06:09.969> might

00:06:10.079 --> 00:06:10.089 
useful especially because people might

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:11.939 
useful especially because people might
not<00:06:10.239> know<00:06:10.299> that<00:06:10.689> right<00:06:10.869> away<00:06:11.019> and<00:06:11.319> there<00:06:11.829> are

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:11.949 
not know that right away and there are

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:16.019 
not know that right away and there are
ways<00:06:12.519> to<00:06:12.549> open<00:06:13.269> it<00:06:13.389> up<00:06:13.509> still<00:06:13.809> um<00:06:14.699> so<00:06:15.699> that's<00:06:15.879> it

00:06:16.019 --> 00:06:16.029 
ways to open it up still um so that's it

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:17.819 
ways to open it up still um so that's it
if<00:06:16.599> you<00:06:16.749> have<00:06:16.959> any<00:06:17.049> other<00:06:17.229> questions<00:06:17.259> or<00:06:17.769> you

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:17.829 
if you have any other questions or you

00:06:17.829 --> 00:06:20.189 
if you have any other questions or you
find<00:06:18.039> anything<00:06:18.249> else<00:06:18.489> about<00:06:18.669> this<00:06:19.199> find
