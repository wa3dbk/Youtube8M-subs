last time but after doing these

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.749 
last time but after doing these
conventional<00:01:49.110> so<00:01:49.350> much<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.740> wrecks<00:01:50.220> your<00:01:50.400> back

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759

so much if you go from conventional to
sumo<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.509> then<00:01:54.960> like<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.290> do<00:01:55.440> sooner<00:01:55.710> forever

sumo and then like you do sooner forever

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.350
