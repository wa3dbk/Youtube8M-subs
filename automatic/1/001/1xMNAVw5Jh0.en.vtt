Tex wrangle these styling will appear
and<00:03:40.420> you<00:03:40.600> can<00:03:40.750> go<00:03:40.870> div<00:03:41.170> ID<00:03:42.040> and<00:03:42.460> it<00:03:42.580> recognizes

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
and you can go div ID and it recognizes

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.870 
and you can go div ID and it recognizes
the<00:03:43.750> different<00:03:43.990> stuff<00:03:44.170> you<00:03:44.350> type<00:03:44.560> in<00:03:44.770> so<00:03:45.760> then

the different stuff you type in so then

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.410 
the different stuff you type in so then
you<00:03:45.940> can<00:03:46.090> live<00:03:46.540> and<00:03:46.900> in<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.290> body<00:03:47.560> etc<00:03:47.980> etc<00:03:48.730> so

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
you can live and in the body etc etc so

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.090 
you can live and in the body etc etc so
that<00:03:49.450> is<00:03:49.720> a<00:03:49.750> nice<00:03:49.930> coating<00:03:50.290> application<00:03:50.920> for

one of the day is to do's and basically

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:14.490 
one of the day is to do's and basically
this<00:04:13.390> is<00:04:13.450> a<00:04:13.510> very<00:04:13.600> simple<00:04:13.810> application<00:04:14.080> it

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500

basically just opens up all your

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.840 
basically just opens up all your
applications<00:04:17.260> in<00:04:17.980> a<00:04:18.040> nice<00:04:18.190> simple<00:04:18.400> window

with<00:04:19.239> a<00:04:19.270> hotkey<00:04:19.660> as<00:04:19.750> well<00:04:19.900> I<00:04:19.930> think<00:04:20.049> you<00:04:20.290> can

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
with a hotkey as well I think you can

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.580 
with a hotkey as well I think you can
specify<00:04:20.760> so<00:04:21.760> we<00:04:22.390> specify<00:04:22.840> a<00:04:22.870> hotkey<00:04:23.230> opium

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
specify so we specify a hotkey opium

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:24.960
