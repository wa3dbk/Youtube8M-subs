both sides and then get ready to cut
yeah<00:01:44.590> that<00:01:44.740> goes<00:01:46.649> so<00:01:47.649> of<00:01:47.770> course<00:01:48.009> before<00:01:48.189> we

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
yeah that goes so of course before we

materials and tools handy of course we

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.190 
materials and tools handy of course we
need<00:01:53.440> a<00:01:53.709> nice<00:01:54.340> razor<00:01:54.909> knife<00:01:55.209> frankly<00:01:55.689> I<00:01:55.720> prefer

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
need a nice razor knife frankly I prefer

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.949 
need a nice razor knife frankly I prefer
to<00:01:56.319> use<00:01:56.439> one<00:01:56.709> where<00:01:56.950> they<00:01:57.069> might<00:01:57.250> want<00:01:57.520> it<00:01:58.179> late

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
because that way you can slice with a

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.600 
because that way you can slice with a
foam<00:02:00.700> core<00:02:01.000> just<00:02:01.420> a<00:02:01.539> little<00:02:01.780> bit<00:02:01.899> better<00:02:02.049> I

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
foam core just a little bit better I

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.010 
foam core just a little bit better I
could<00:02:03.610> have<00:02:03.789> very<00:02:04.030> very<00:02:04.240> cheap<00:02:04.509> make<00:02:04.780> sure

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
could have very very cheap make sure

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.309 
could have very very cheap make sure
it's<00:02:05.259> sharp<00:02:05.349> now<00:02:06.069> a<00:02:06.509> nice<00:02:07.509> straight<00:02:07.869> edge<00:02:07.899> I

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
it's sharp now a nice straight edge I

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.600 
it's sharp now a nice straight edge I
like<00:02:08.709> a<00:02:08.739> nice<00:02:09.179> long<00:02:10.179> metal<00:02:11.140> ruler<00:02:12.069> to<00:02:12.430> work

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
like a nice long metal ruler to work

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.130 
like a nice long metal ruler to work
with<00:02:12.849> because<00:02:13.090> you<00:02:13.480> know<00:02:13.540> your<00:02:13.720> blade<00:02:13.870> can't

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
with because you know your blade can't

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.020 
with because you know your blade can't
cut<00:02:14.349> it<00:02:14.470> quite<00:02:14.769> as<00:02:14.980> easily<00:02:15.160> it<00:02:15.670> helps<00:02:15.880> keep

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:45.199 
pretty spiffy and it weighs about the

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:47.770 
pretty spiffy and it weighs about the
same<00:05:45.319> as<00:05:45.530> the<00:05:45.710> beer<00:05:45.889> speaking<00:05:46.370> of<00:05:46.460> which<00:05:46.780> they

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
same as the beer speaking of which they

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:55.029 
same as the beer speaking of which they
might<00:05:47.960> need<00:05:48.050> another<00:05:48.139> one<00:05:53.110> okay<00:05:54.110> so<00:05:54.379> I<00:05:54.620> have<00:05:55.009> a

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039

confession to make

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:00.399 
confession to make
while<00:05:57.129> working<00:05:58.129> on<00:05:58.460> the<00:05:58.759> bezel<00:05:59.000> for<00:05:59.509> the<00:05:59.719> front

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:00.409 
while working on the bezel for the front

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:04.830 
while working on the bezel for the front
of<00:06:00.560> the<00:06:00.740> arcade<00:06:01.699> top<00:06:02.979> for<00:06:03.979> the<00:06:04.069> monitor<00:06:04.460> I

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 
of the arcade top for the monitor I

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.330 
of the arcade top for the monitor I
tried<00:06:05.840> to<00:06:05.960> trim<00:06:06.229> off<00:06:06.409> a<00:06:06.440> piece<00:06:06.800> while<00:06:07.129> it<00:06:07.219> was

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.340 
tried to trim off a piece while it was

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.820 
tried to trim off a piece while it was
on<00:06:07.490> and<00:06:07.940> it<00:06:08.150> didn't<00:06:08.449> really<00:06:08.750> work<00:06:09.020> out<00:06:09.319> blade

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:09.830 
on and it didn't really work out blade

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.850 
on and it didn't really work out blade
kind<00:06:10.099> of<00:06:10.250> bent<00:06:11.030> and<00:06:11.330> I<00:06:11.509> kind<00:06:12.229> of<00:06:12.289> fucked<00:06:12.530> it<00:06:12.710> up

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
kind of bent and I kind of fucked it up

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.159 
kind of bent and I kind of fucked it up
so<00:06:13.210> only<00:06:14.210> one<00:06:14.330> thing<00:06:14.479> I<00:06:14.569> can<00:06:14.719> think<00:06:14.750> of<00:06:15.020> doing

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:15.169 
so only one thing I can think of doing

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:17.050 
so only one thing I can think of doing
to<00:06:15.409> make<00:06:15.560> it<00:06:15.710> right<00:06:15.919> and<00:06:16.219> that<00:06:16.520> is<00:06:16.729> of<00:06:16.849> course

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:17.060 
to make it right and that is of course

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:37.879 
to make it right and that is of course
to<00:06:17.840> apply<00:06:18.110> more<00:06:18.379> power

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:37.889 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:41.659
