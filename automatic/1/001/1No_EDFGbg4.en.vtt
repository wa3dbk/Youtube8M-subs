00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
I'll sure one of them off because the

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.630 
I'll sure one of them off because the
gameplay<00:01:05.560> change<00:01:05.890> is<00:01:06.009> complete<00:01:06.159> than<00:01:06.549> when

mention while it's on the top left of
the<00:02:39.260> screen<00:02:39.319> that's<00:02:39.770> basically<00:02:40.069> an<00:02:40.250> energy

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
the screen that's basically an energy

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:41.949 
the screen that's basically an energy
bar<00:02:40.700> you<00:02:41.000> want<00:02:41.360> to<00:02:41.420> be<00:02:41.510> on<00:02:41.569> the<00:02:41.660> lookout<00:02:41.900> for

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
energy when you need it obviously you

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.400 
energy when you need it obviously you
can<00:02:43.880> also<00:02:44.030> collect<00:02:44.480> them<00:02:44.660> extra<00:02:44.959> lives<00:02:45.140> at

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
can also collect them extra lives at

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:46.840 
can also collect them extra lives at
hidden<00:02:45.680> around<00:02:45.769> the<00:02:45.950> levels<00:02:46.280> of<00:02:46.459> just<00:02:46.700> like

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
hidden around the levels of just like

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.120 
hidden around the levels of just like
basically<00:02:47.300> be<00:02:47.630> little<00:02:47.930> well<00:02:48.530> if<00:02:48.860> it's

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
basically be little well if it's

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.220 
basically be little well if it's

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
a market so as I say it's a pretty cool

a market so as I say it's a pretty cool
award<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:30.900> it's<00:03:30.959> just<00:03:31.110> a<00:03:31.200> shame<00:03:31.410> that<00:03:31.470> these

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
award and it's just a shame that these

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.620 
award and it's just a shame that these
missions<00:03:32.610> aren't<00:03:32.820> actually<00:03:33.150> longer<00:03:33.390> or

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
missions aren't actually longer or

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.570 
missions aren't actually longer or
anything<00:03:33.959> because<00:03:34.140> as<00:03:35.010> you've<00:03:35.220> seen<00:03:35.370> that

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
anything because as you've seen that

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.060 
anything because as you've seen that
took<00:03:35.940> what<00:03:36.209> 15<00:03:36.690> seconds<00:03:37.020> to<00:03:37.080> do<00:03:37.170> luck<00:03:37.350> and<00:03:37.530> when

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
took what 15 seconds to do luck and when

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.260 
took what 15 seconds to do luck and when
you<00:03:38.160> get<00:03:38.280> like<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.610> bazooka<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:39.150> other

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
you get like the bazooka and other

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:40.880 
you get like the bazooka and other
things<00:03:39.570> you<00:03:39.690> can<00:03:39.780> destroy<00:03:40.110> it<00:03:40.200> in<00:03:40.320> one<00:03:40.470> hit<00:03:40.680> so

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
things you can destroy it in one hit so

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.550 
things you can destroy it in one hit so
it's<00:03:41.040> even<00:03:41.160> faster<00:03:41.480> but<00:03:42.480> anywhere<00:03:42.750> just<00:03:43.350> going

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
it's even faster but anywhere just going

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.990 
it's even faster but anywhere just going
to<00:03:43.620> quit<00:03:43.800> out<00:03:43.920> now<00:03:44.100> just<00:03:44.130> simply<00:03:44.700> because<00:03:44.970> I

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
to quit out now just simply because I

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.949 
to quit out now just simply because I
did<00:03:45.150> see<00:03:45.330> I'd<00:03:45.420> show<00:03:45.630> up<00:03:45.660> one<00:03:45.810> of<00:03:45.900> the

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959
