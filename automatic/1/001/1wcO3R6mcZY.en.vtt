the scenes of just them talking

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.270 
the scenes of just them talking
interacting<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.439> seeing<00:01:19.740> what<00:01:20.040> would<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.250> be

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
interacting of seeing what would it be

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.039 
interacting of seeing what would it be
like<00:01:20.400> if<00:01:20.640> Captain<00:01:21.060> America<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.630> Iron<00:01:21.810> Man

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
like if Captain America and Iron Man

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.870 
like if Captain America and Iron Man
were<00:01:22.170> an<00:01:22.290> argument<00:01:22.890> much<00:01:23.400> less<00:01:23.640> fighting

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
were an argument much less fighting

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.850 
were an argument much less fighting
alongside<00:01:24.210> each<00:01:24.479> other<00:01:24.750> one<00:01:25.320> fear<00:01:25.619> is<00:01:25.740> that

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
alongside each other one fear is that

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.649 
alongside each other one fear is that
with<00:01:26.009> so<00:01:26.130> many<00:01:26.220> characters<00:01:26.490> everyone<00:01:27.450> might

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
with so many characters everyone might

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.810 
with so many characters everyone might
not<00:01:27.840> get<00:01:28.020> there<00:01:28.170> do<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.590> would<00:01:28.710> say<00:01:28.979> Hawkeye

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
not get there do and I would say Hawkeye

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.460 
not get there do and I would say Hawkeye
and<00:01:30.150> some<00:01:30.360> respects<00:01:30.750> he<00:01:31.020> kind<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.290> got<00:01:31.409> the

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
and some respects he kind of got the

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.260 
and some respects he kind of got the
short<00:01:31.590> straw<00:01:31.829> here<00:01:32.369> he's<00:01:32.640> cool<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.030> what<00:01:33.150> we

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
short straw here he's cool and what we

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.030 
short straw here he's cool and what we
see<00:01:33.479> him<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.689> but<00:01:33.930> there's<00:01:34.079> not<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.290> lot<00:01:34.680> for<00:01:34.950> the

general<00:02:30.510> I<00:02:30.599> think<00:02:30.629> the<00:02:30.900> action<00:02:31.260> really

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:33.470 
general I think the action really
delivers<00:02:31.950> yes<00:02:32.549> I<00:02:32.730> think<00:02:32.940> Joss<00:02:33.120> Whedon's

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480

greatest<00:02:34.170> strength<00:02:34.409> of<00:02:34.560> all<00:02:34.680> is<00:02:34.860> his

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
greatest strength of all is his

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.830 
greatest strength of all is his
character<00:02:35.459> moments<00:02:35.610> and<00:02:35.879> dialogue<00:02:36.299> but

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
character moments and dialogue but

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.240 
character moments and dialogue but
there's<00:02:37.049> also<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.349> lot<00:02:37.440> of<00:02:37.620> great<00:02:37.769> action<00:02:37.950> here

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
there's also a lot of great action here

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.160 
there's also a lot of great action here
the<00:02:38.430> first<00:02:38.670> half<00:02:39.000> kind<00:02:39.480> of<00:02:39.599> goes<00:02:39.690> back<00:02:39.720> and

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
the first half kind of goes back and

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.990 
the first half kind of goes back and
forth<00:02:40.230> through<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.890> establishing<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.760> team

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
the last third of this movie really

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.930 
the last third of this movie really
delivers<00:02:46.799> when<00:02:47.010> you<00:02:47.099> really<00:02:47.370> see<00:02:47.519> this<00:02:47.640> team

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
delivers when you really see this team

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.610 
delivers when you really see this team
come<00:02:48.299> together<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.810> all<00:02:48.900> these<00:02:49.049> superheroes
