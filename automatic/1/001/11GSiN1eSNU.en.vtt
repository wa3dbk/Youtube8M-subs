00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
aged between I think 12 and 18 so they

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.750 
aged between I think 12 and 18 so they
were<00:00:15.540> teenagers<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.170> we<00:00:17.070> took<00:00:17.250> them<00:00:17.400> all<00:00:17.520> over

American<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.690> just<00:00:19.020> thought<00:00:19.140> I<00:00:19.199> could<00:00:19.350> do

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
American and I just thought I could do

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.900 
American and I just thought I could do
more<00:00:19.740> I<00:00:20.010> could<00:00:20.279> actually<00:00:20.430> make<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.789> difference

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
more I could actually make a difference

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.390 
more I could actually make a difference
and<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.539> could<00:00:21.840> do<00:00:21.960> more<00:00:22.170> so<00:00:22.439> it<00:00:23.039> took<00:00:23.250> me

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
and I could do more so it took me

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.279 
and I could do more so it took me
probably<00:00:23.580> two<00:00:24.180> three<00:00:24.570> years<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.900> set<00:00:25.080> up<00:00:25.170> a
