then<00:00:21.750> I'm<00:00:21.930> gonna<00:00:22.080> add<00:00:22.320> some<00:00:22.350> acai<00:00:23.340> which<00:00:24.300> is<00:00:24.420> an

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
then I'm gonna add some acai which is an

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.589 
then I'm gonna add some acai which is an
amazing<00:00:24.840> super<00:00:25.740> fruit<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:27.000> they<00:00:27.119> don't<00:00:27.330> come

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
amazing super fruit and they don't come

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.720 
amazing super fruit and they don't come
in<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.810> United<00:00:28.199> States<00:00:28.590> so<00:00:29.070> they're<00:00:29.580> too

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
in the United States so they're too

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.880 
in the United States so they're too
fragile<00:00:29.939> for<00:00:30.210> transport<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.230> it's<00:00:31.380> okay<00:00:31.830> to

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
fragile for transport so it's okay to

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.260 
fragile for transport so it's okay to
buy<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.160> right<00:00:32.279> off<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.579> shelf<00:00:32.730> it's<00:00:32.969> okay

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
buy it right off the shelf it's okay

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.220 
buy it right off the shelf it's okay
that<00:00:33.420> it's<00:00:33.450> not<00:00:33.719> fresh<00:00:34.070> so<00:00:35.070> let's<00:00:35.309> get<00:00:35.520> juicing

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
that it's not fresh so let's get juicing

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.680 
that it's not fresh so let's get juicing
we're<00:00:37.230> also<00:00:37.320> gonna<00:00:37.530> use<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.640> Breville<00:00:39.270> multi

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
we're also gonna use the Breville multi

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.130 
we're also gonna use the Breville multi
speed<00:00:39.989> juicer<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.500> juice<00:00:41.480> the<00:00:42.480> pair<00:00:42.809> at<00:00:43.020> the

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
speed juicer to juice the pair at the

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.350 
speed juicer to juice the pair at the
strawberry<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.710> these<00:00:44.160> berries<00:00:44.579> because<00:00:45.120> we

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
strawberry and these berries because we

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.670 
strawberry and these berries because we
don't<00:00:45.510> really<00:00:45.600> want<00:00:45.840> all<00:00:45.989> these<00:00:46.170> seeds<00:00:46.410> in<00:00:46.590> our

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
don't really want all these seeds in our

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.860 
don't really want all these seeds in our
teeth<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.789> best<00:00:48.300> thing<00:00:48.539> about<00:00:48.570> this

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
teeth and the best thing about this

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.930 
teeth and the best thing about this
rebel<00:00:49.079> multi<00:00:49.800> speed<00:00:50.039> juicer<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.760> there's

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
rebel multi speed juicer is that there's

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.180 
rebel multi speed juicer is that there's
a<00:00:51.149> low<00:00:51.329> speed<00:00:51.600> setting<00:00:51.930> number<00:00:52.079> one<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:52.949> that

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
a low speed setting number one so that

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.100 
a low speed setting number one so that
it<00:00:53.340> extracts<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.000> juice<00:00:54.090> but<00:00:54.570> not<00:00:54.719> too<00:00:54.960> high

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
it extracts the juice but not too high

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.260 
it extracts the juice but not too high
of<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.350> speed<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.860> way<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.460> get<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.850> most<00:00:57.000> out

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
of a speed that way you get the most out

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.090 
of a speed that way you get the most out
of<00:00:57.300> your<00:00:57.390> berry<00:00:57.690> whereas<00:00:58.379> other<00:00:58.680> blend

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
of your berry whereas other blend

of your berry whereas other blend
juicers<00:00:59.550> just<00:00:59.820> one<00:01:00.239> speed<00:01:00.629> high<00:01:01.320> move<00:01:02.219> you

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
juicers just one speed high move you

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.160 
juicers just one speed high move you
don't<00:01:02.820> even<00:01:03.030> get<00:01:03.210> anything<00:01:03.510> out<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:04.049> and

and<00:01:52.350> now<00:01:52.440> let's<00:01:52.680> turn<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.130> down<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.460> the

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
and now let's turn it down to the

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.810 
and now let's turn it down to the
low-speed<00:01:54.390> speed<00:01:54.840> number<00:01:54.990> one<00:01:55.369> since<00:01:56.369> berries

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
low-speed speed number one since berries

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.330 
low-speed speed number one since berries
are<00:01:57.060> small<00:01:57.390> I'm<00:01:57.630> gonna<00:01:57.810> turn<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.500> off<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:59.010> load

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
are small I'm gonna turn it off and load

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.490 
are small I'm gonna turn it off and load
it<00:01:59.520> right<00:01:59.700> now<00:02:02.600> put<00:02:03.600> all<00:02:03.720> these<00:02:03.840> berries<00:02:04.259> in

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
it right now put all these berries in

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:14.720 
it right now put all these berries in
here<00:02:05.750> okay<00:02:12.830> strawberries<00:02:13.830> you<00:02:13.860> can<00:02:14.010> if<00:02:14.280> it's

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
here okay strawberries you can if it's

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:15.920 
here okay strawberries you can if it's
an<00:02:14.850> option<00:02:15.209> you<00:02:15.270> could<00:02:15.390> really<00:02:15.630> blend<00:02:15.840> the

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
an option you could really blend the

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.350 
an option you could really blend the
strawberries<00:02:16.350> or<00:02:16.470> you<00:02:16.530> can<00:02:16.709> juice<00:02:16.950> them<00:02:17.360> it

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
strawberries or you can juice them it

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.030 
strawberries or you can juice them it
just<00:02:18.540> depends<00:02:18.900> on<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.170> seeds<00:02:19.470> if<00:02:19.739> you<00:02:19.860> want

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
just depends on the seeds if you want

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.550 
just depends on the seeds if you want
them<00:02:20.130> in<00:02:20.160> your<00:02:20.220> mouth<00:02:20.400> or<00:02:20.700> not<00:02:20.819> I<00:02:21.410> don't<00:02:22.410> really

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
them in your mouth or not I don't really

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.690 
them in your mouth or not I don't really
notice<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:22.980> difference

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
notice the difference

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.000 
notice the difference
I'll<00:02:23.970> do<00:02:24.269> something<00:02:24.510> up<00:02:24.690> to<00:02:25.500> show<00:02:25.709> you<00:02:25.769> that

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010
