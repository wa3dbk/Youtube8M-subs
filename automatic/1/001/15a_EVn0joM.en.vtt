00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:18.250
 pretty old so we're going to 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:22.730
 work specifically on this 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:25.940
 changing the handles because they 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:29.930
 you have are very old 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:33.070
 and changing the hinges since the one that 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.070
 have are black 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.909

 [Music] 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.769
 [Applause] 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.080
 here we can give the hinges the 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.270
 old black hinges 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.640
 at this moment we take out the door and 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.520
 After removing the door we take out the 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.740
 screws and we remove each hinge to 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:41.440
 put the new hinges of the same 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.440
 model but in steel color 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.370
 Here we are going to have to use the 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:50.890
 same holes 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.890
 we are putting the new hinges 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.830
 and we are also changing for some 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.110
 Handles with a much more modern design 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.700
 using a hole used plus a hole 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.689
 new 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:07.539
 the equipment for this kitchen a granite a 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:10.979
 black galaxy to give more personality 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.979
 we want to make a radical change 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.020

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.910

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.910

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.500
