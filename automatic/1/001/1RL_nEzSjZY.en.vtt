 now now now 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.810
 Dear viewers in this episode of medicine today we will try to find out 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.130
 something about a particular aspect of holistic medicine 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.250
 represented by integrated clinical posturology 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.340
 and here with us doctor paolo zanarella surgeon osteopath referent 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.280
 scientist of the posturology school of rome taranto and milano doctor 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.550
 welcome good morning to you and doctor viewers in what 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.700
 consists of integrated clinical posturology 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.730
 the integrated clinical dosage consists of a global evaluation approach 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.590
 specialist to the individual 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.750
 after asking questions 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.060
 and on the general state of health and the posturologist 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.140
 I begin to perform postural assessment tests 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.180
 to try to understand and what postural attitudes are 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.400
 individual 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.490
 and also the presence of what is wrong with the body 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.369
 and using posture as a kind of 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.729
 and exam screen is to be able to investigate the rest of the body and also trying to 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.080
 discover the difference between primary dysfunctions 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.600
 and adaptive dysfunctions 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.770
 doctor what is meant by the term posture 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.570
 here we mean by the term posture 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.090
 the strategy 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.270
 it is used by the system and skeletal neuromuscular 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.270
 perrelet react to stresses that remain in balance 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:00.730
 in the most economical way possible 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.840
 there is an important difference to be made between the concept of balance il 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.790
 concept of posture one can remain in balance but without maintaining one 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.960
 correct posture and that I rise I mica economic and therefore without wearing 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.260
 dysfunctions see suffering 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.900
 so the posturologist pines so interesting not of the defects 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:21.949
 balance 

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:25.119
 mad and defects of the posture of the defects of the English ones in the text of the 

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:28.119
 specialists such as the eight neurological neurologists 

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:32.290
 through other examinations the date on people who do not have 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.509
 it is the ability to stay in balance 

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:36.669
 the posturologist studies at all 

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:39.830
 the defects of posture alterations to be able to 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.449
 investigate what 

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:44.120
 it does not go to the body or to the skeletal level 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.509
 but also at other levels 

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:50.419
 doctor so we can say that the postural system behaves like one 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:55.039
 large antenna that perceives different stimuli and variations and makes the 

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:57.990
 body consequently certainly posture 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.910
 pear presents the Roman place really represents the resultant 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.389
 systemic 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:06.959
 of a set of discussions of alterations of stimuli arriving on the 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:07.579
 body 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:10.799
 enough eheh different windows 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.029
 eheh from above 

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:14.499
 and biochemical nutrition from the part 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:16.540
 hair mechanical trauma 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.600
 repeated microtraum hours 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.570
 but also from the point of view they are demoon al and psychological can arrive some 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.870
 interference that modifies the posture is a bit 'the concept of vessels 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.750
 communicating it is impossible not communicating vessel to separate the variation of 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.180
 a single part from what happens the whole body eh acts on the same 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.309
 way and everything in the end 

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:41.119
 will bring modified posture cars 

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:44.119
 but posturologist is a specialist 

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:49.009
 meanwhile we must say that in Italy it is the profession of posturologist is not one 

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:50.439
 regulated profession 

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:54.449
 but it is but we can perhaps say the opposite yesterday 

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:56.239
 while it is more and more 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.519
 hehe are activating the specialties of the super specialties for 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.330
 explore more examples in the field 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.680
 the posturologist 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.090
 as I imagine it as the model teaches it flows as in the end there 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.690
 we find 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.200
 working with our patients the posturologist is a professional from 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.179
 specialized 

00:04:15.179 --> 00:04:18.560
 renunciation of the partial sectoral aspect 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.180
 to look at the whole to look together 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.820
 on a diagnostic level to understand 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.820
 where is the cause and where the effect of a dysfunction 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.180
 I can tell you a short story about this 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.120
 concept 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.870
 and it is the difference between the dosage and the specialization at the beginning of 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:35.480
 our 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.430
 and to venture and before starting to realize the school of posturology 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.580
 and we have prison some patients and we sent them around from very valid 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.449
 specialist professionals 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:49.080
 and to be able to investigate their dysfunction 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.860
 the symptom told was always the same a series of symptoms was there is a 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.509
 cervical headache problem chewing ailment eeeh pains 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:04:59.319
 emigrants of the body 

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:01.979
 but what was not happening 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:08.330
 eg at the end each specialist proposed a specialist therapy 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.789
 specialist 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:14.110
 l were not the case given by its strict ambit division 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.530
 so we had very valid dentists 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.400
 who proposed bait orthodontic ophthalmologists who suggested 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.910
 eyeglasses to the same patient say that they suggested physical therapies 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.030
 manipulations 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.120
 l podiatrists suggesting orthotics 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.069
 is one of these lost italy specialists 

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:34.409
 the ability to observe together 

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:38.300
 and finding almost his symptoms represented the cause and which 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.099
 representing the effect this was one of the things that pushed us to open 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:45.409
 the school of posturology that can be constituted as 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:50.009
 a common language among these specialists to understand where to start 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:50.939
 to deal 

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:52.819
 a dysfunctional problem
