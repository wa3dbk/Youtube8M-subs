camera which if I double-click on will
open<00:00:21.900> in<00:00:22.050> quicktime<00:00:24.170> so<00:00:25.170> let's<00:00:25.500> pretend<00:00:25.830> we've

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
open in quicktime so let's pretend we've

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.720 
open in quicktime so let's pretend we've
watched<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.490> video<00:00:28.099> close<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.279> window<00:00:29.519> there

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
watched the video close the window there

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.089 
watched the video close the window there
and<00:00:29.970> now<00:00:30.840> i'm<00:00:30.960> done<00:00:31.170> with<00:00:31.289> this<00:00:31.410> card<00:00:31.710> so<00:00:32.070> i

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
and now i'm done with this card so i

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:39.670 
and now i'm done with this card so i
want<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.579> reject<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:33.380> so<00:00:34.610> i'll<00:00:35.610> check<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.030> card

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.010 

but<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.770> doesn't<00:00:40.980> work<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.310> says<00:00:41.840> one<00:00:42.840> or<00:00:42.930> more

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
but it doesn't work it says one or more

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.280 
but it doesn't work it says one or more
programs<00:00:43.470> may<00:00:43.830> be<00:00:43.890> using<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.400> well<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.390> don't

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
programs may be using it well I don't

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.500 
programs may be using it well I don't
have<00:00:46.470> anything<00:00:46.800> running<00:00:47.100> except<00:00:47.640> launch<00:00:48.180> bar

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
have anything running except launch bar

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.750 
have anything running except launch bar
I<00:00:48.750> don't<00:00:49.440> think<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.710> could<00:00:49.830> be<00:00:49.950> launch<00:00:50.130> bar<00:00:50.460> but

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
I don't think it could be launch bar but

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.530 
I don't think it could be launch bar but
will<00:00:50.910> quit<00:00:51.150> that<00:00:51.300> maybe<00:00:53.060> now<00:00:54.060> that<00:00:54.090> doesn't

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
will quit that maybe now that doesn't

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.660 
will quit that maybe now that doesn't
seem<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.780> have<00:00:54.900> helped<00:00:55.160> now<00:00:56.160> at<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:56.400> point

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
seem to have helped now at this point

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.210 
seem to have helped now at this point
you<00:00:57.000> might<00:00:57.690> reboot<00:00:58.140> because<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.739> think<00:00:58.980> well

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
you might reboot because you think well

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.680 
you might reboot because you think well
there's<00:00:59.850> an<00:00:59.970> applications<00:01:00.450> running

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
there's an applications running

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.380 
there's an applications running
something<00:01:01.380> must<00:01:01.530> have<00:01:01.650> gone<00:01:01.680> wrong<00:01:02.330> but<00:01:03.330> I

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
something must have gone wrong but I

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.750 
something must have gone wrong but I
wanted<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.900> find<00:01:04.080> out<00:01:04.140> what<00:01:04.290> was<00:01:04.320> going<00:01:04.440> on<00:01:04.770> we

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
wanted to find out what was going on we

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.010 
wanted to find out what was going on we
can<00:01:05.970> use<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.630> command<00:01:07.470> line<00:01:07.770> tool<00:01:08.100> called<00:01:09.020> lsof

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
can use a command line tool called lsof

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.930 
can use a command line tool called lsof
which<00:01:10.710> stands<00:01:10.979> for<00:01:11.100> list<00:01:11.580> open<00:01:12.030> files<00:01:13.550> and<00:01:14.550> I

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
which stands for list open files and I

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.480 
which stands for list open files and I
know<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.570> card<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.140> called<00:01:16.440> cam<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.369> we

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
know that the card is called cam so we

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.940 
know that the card is called cam so we
can<00:01:17.640> say<00:01:17.880> show<00:01:18.750> me<00:01:18.780> only<00:01:18.900> open<00:01:19.380> files<00:01:19.650> that

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
can say show me only open files that

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.570 
can say show me only open files that
have<00:01:20.070> cam<00:01:20.369> in<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.700> name<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:22.070> here<00:01:23.070> we<00:01:23.100> can<00:01:23.310> see

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
have cam in the name and here we can see

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.350 
have cam in the name and here we can see
at<00:01:24.300> the<00:01:24.750> end<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:25.050> the<00:01:25.170> list<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.590> my<00:01:26.580> video<00:01:26.790> open

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
at the end of the list is my video open

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.020 
at the end of the list is my video open
by<00:01:27.509> quick<00:01:27.930> time<00:01:28.460> well<00:01:29.460> that's<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.759> little<00:01:29.940> bit

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
by quick time well that's a little bit

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.210 
by quick time well that's a little bit
confusing<00:01:30.420> isn't<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.720> because<00:01:31.080> quick<00:01:32.009> times

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
confusing isn't it because quick times

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.180 
confusing isn't it because quick times
not<00:01:32.430> running<00:01:32.790> don't<00:01:33.360> see<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.600> on<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.810> dock<00:01:34.190> but

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
not running don't see it on the dock but

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.070 
not running don't see it on the dock but
we<00:01:35.280> can<00:01:35.400> check<00:01:35.640> using<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.240> activity<00:01:36.720> monitor

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
we can check using the activity monitor

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.080 
we can check using the activity monitor
this<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.500> built-in<00:01:37.920> utility<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.700> lets<00:01:38.940> us

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
this is a built-in utility that lets us

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.290 
this is a built-in utility that lets us
check<00:01:39.920> to<00:01:40.920> see<00:01:41.070> exactly<00:01:41.340> what's<00:01:41.910> running<00:01:42.119> on

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
check to see exactly what's running on

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.630 
check to see exactly what's running on
this<00:01:42.810> machine<00:01:43.080> and<00:01:45.800> there<00:01:46.800> it<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:46.920> quicktime

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
this machine and there it is quicktime

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.560 
this machine and there it is quicktime
player<00:01:49.010> so<00:01:50.010> what<00:01:50.159> you're<00:01:50.280> seeing<00:01:50.490> here<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:51.030> a

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
player so what you're seeing here is a

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.690 
player so what you're seeing here is a
new<00:01:51.840> feature<00:01:52.050> of<00:01:52.260> line<00:01:52.440> where<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.800> icons<00:01:53.460> on

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
new feature of line where the icons on

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.280 
new feature of line where the icons on
the<00:01:53.729> dock<00:01:54.060> don't<00:01:54.390> necessarily<00:01:55.110> represent

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
the dock don't necessarily represent

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.410 
the dock don't necessarily represent
what's<00:01:56.190> actually<00:01:56.490> running<00:01:58.040> icons<00:01:59.040> can<00:01:59.220> be

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
what's actually running icons can be

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.410 
what's actually running icons can be
hidden<00:02:00.420> or<00:02:01.010> in<00:02:02.010> fact<00:02:02.190> icons<00:02:02.760> can<00:02:02.970> show<00:02:03.120> that<00:02:03.150> an

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
hidden or in fact icons can show that an

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.000 
hidden or in fact icons can show that an
application<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:04.080> running<00:02:04.290> even<00:02:04.740> when<00:02:04.920> it

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
application is running even when it

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.570 
application is running even when it
isn't<00:02:05.159> it<00:02:05.430> works<00:02:05.640> both<00:02:06.360> ways<00:02:06.630> round<00:02:06.900> I<00:02:07.580> guess

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
isn't it works both ways round I guess

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.979 
isn't it works both ways round I guess
the<00:02:08.729> reason<00:02:08.850> that<00:02:08.970> Apple<00:02:09.299> have<00:02:09.390> done<00:02:09.540> this<00:02:09.720> is

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
the reason that Apple have done this is

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.390 
the reason that Apple have done this is
because<00:02:10.019> they're<00:02:10.679> trying<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.040> make<00:02:11.160> it<00:02:11.280> more

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
because they're trying to make it more

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.030 
because they're trying to make it more
like<00:02:11.459> iOS<00:02:12.450> it's<00:02:13.019> not<00:02:13.260> important<00:02:13.739> what

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
like iOS it's not important what

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.190 
like iOS it's not important what
applications<00:02:14.610> are<00:02:14.700> running<00:02:14.850> because<00:02:15.420> the
