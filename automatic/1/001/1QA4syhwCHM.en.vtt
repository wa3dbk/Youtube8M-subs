00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
dough now I probably don't want a

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.129 
dough now I probably don't want a
surface<00:01:12.819> and<00:01:12.999> I'm<00:01:13.060> going<00:01:13.240> to<00:01:13.329> knead<00:01:13.630> it<00:01:13.659> for

00:01:14.129 --> 00:01:14.139 
surface and I'm going to knead it for

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:16.679 
surface and I'm going to knead it for
about<00:01:15.069> five<00:01:15.460> minutes<00:01:15.759> and<00:01:16.270> the<00:01:16.359> way<00:01:16.479> I'm<00:01:16.569> going

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:16.689 
about five minutes and the way I'm going

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:18.899 
about five minutes and the way I'm going
to<00:01:16.780> do<00:01:16.899> it<00:01:17.020> is<00:01:17.109> with<00:01:17.259> a<00:01:17.319> slope<00:01:17.799> and<00:01:18.100> roll

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
to do it is with a slope and roll

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.749 
to do it is with a slope and roll
technique<00:01:19.299> to<00:01:19.869> start<00:01:20.200> with<00:01:20.469> until<00:01:21.459> some<00:01:21.670> of

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
technique to start with until some of

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:23.760 
technique to start with until some of
the<00:01:21.819> stickiness<00:01:22.600> has<00:01:22.810> gone<00:01:22.990> out<00:01:23.200> of<00:01:23.289> it<00:01:23.530> so

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
the stickiness has gone out of it so

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.429 
the stickiness has gone out of it so
quarter<00:01:24.670> turn<00:01:24.880> to<00:01:25.090> slap<00:01:25.389> it<00:01:25.569> down<00:01:25.600> roll<00:01:26.259> it

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
quarter turn to slap it down roll it

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:29.010 
quarter turn to slap it down roll it
over<00:01:26.560> quarter<00:01:27.340> turn<00:01:27.579> slap<00:01:28.119> it<00:01:28.270> down<00:01:28.299> roll<00:01:28.810> it

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
over quarter turn slap it down roll it

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.830 
over quarter turn slap it down roll it
over<00:01:29.139> and<00:01:29.679> having<00:01:30.399> a<00:01:30.579> plastic<00:01:30.789> scraper<00:01:31.359> kind

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
over and having a plastic scraper kind

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.940 
over and having a plastic scraper kind
of<00:01:31.959> helps<00:01:32.350> to<00:01:32.560> keep<00:01:33.219> it<00:01:33.369> all<00:01:33.549> together<00:01:33.759> -<00:01:34.270> it

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
of helps to keep it all together - it

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:44.870 
of helps to keep it all together - it
sticks<00:01:35.950> to<00:01:36.159> the<00:01:36.189> work<00:01:36.490> surface

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.249 

so<00:01:45.880> I've<00:01:45.970> been<00:01:46.119> doing<00:01:46.450> this<00:01:46.600> for<00:01:46.780> about<00:01:46.960> five

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
so I've been doing this for about five

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.710 
so I've been doing this for about five
minutes<00:01:47.590> so<00:01:47.950> he's<00:01:48.159> lost<00:01:48.340> like<00:01:49.270> a<00:01:49.299> bit<00:01:49.509> of<00:01:49.600> its

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
minutes so he's lost like a bit of its

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.710 
minutes so he's lost like a bit of its
stickiness<00:01:50.320> but<00:01:50.350> by<00:01:50.680> no<00:01:50.860> means<00:01:50.920> all<00:01:51.280> of<00:01:51.520> it<00:01:51.720> now

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
stickiness but by no means all of it now

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.850 
stickiness but by no means all of it now
I'm<00:01:52.810> going<00:01:52.990> to<00:01:53.049> spread<00:01:53.470> this<00:01:53.680> dough<00:01:53.979> out<00:01:54.009> and

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
I'm going to spread this dough out and

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.160 
I'm going to spread this dough out and
add<00:01:56.860> in<00:01:57.100> a<00:01:57.369> hundred<00:01:57.729> grams<00:01:58.149> of<00:01:58.450> softened

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
add in a hundred grams of softened

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.920 
add in a hundred grams of softened
butter<00:01:59.759> to<00:02:00.759> room<00:02:01.060> temperature

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930

butter to room temperature
you<00:02:02.799> don't<00:02:03.009> want<00:02:03.250> melted<00:02:03.880> butter<00:02:04.149> in<00:02:04.390> this

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
you don't want melted butter in this

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:05.820 
you don't want melted butter in this
otherwise<00:02:04.869> it's<00:02:05.289> going<00:02:05.409> to<00:02:05.470> become<00:02:05.649> a

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
otherwise it's going to become a

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.040

together trust me it gets worse before
it<00:02:27.910> gets<00:02:28.150> better<00:02:30.510> now<00:02:31.510> after<00:02:31.630> just<00:02:31.930> two

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
it gets better now after just two

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.830 
it gets better now after just two
minutes<00:02:32.790> it's<00:02:33.790> lost<00:02:34.150> a<00:02:34.360> lot<00:02:34.540> of<00:02:34.690> its

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
minutes it's lost a lot of its

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.840 
minutes it's lost a lot of its
stickiness<00:02:35.350> as<00:02:35.709> you<00:02:35.830> can<00:02:35.980> see<00:02:36.130> how<00:02:36.250> easily<00:02:36.670> I

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850
