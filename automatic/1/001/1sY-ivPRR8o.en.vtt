00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:11.200
If someone asks you to put an angel on
their back you can think: I don't do angels.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.480
I do dragons or fish,
but that's ridiculous.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.440
It's more interesting to find out
what this person really wants.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.840
It's not good when somebody comes in
and says: Do what you like.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.480
I need a certain amount of input.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.520
It's a studio, not a shop.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.680
We don't sell tattoos, we make them.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:44.280
Prior to making a tattoo, we talk
to the client, we communicate first.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.360
To see if we're able to translate
the client's main idea into a tattoo.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.200
The next step is a sketch,
to get a feel for the right direction.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.880
Before we make a final drawing.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.760
A rejected drawing costs us a lot of time,
a sketch is much quicker.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.400
If people want something, we have
examples of what it might end up like.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.160
It's easier to see through a sketch
when you've seen similar things.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.840
After the sketch, we get to the drawing
and now people get enthusiastic.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.000
They trust us due to the communication,
and everything we showed them...

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.800
...everything we discussed.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.160
Then it's time to transfer the drawing
to the skin.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.320
Now I have to draw the rough background,
in detail on the customer.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.400
Even now, anything can happen,
the customer also has a say in it.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.640
They look at it in the mirror
and tell me what they think.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.720
They have to look beyond it 
but it always seems to work out fine.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.920
When tattooing you try
not to wipe off the drawing.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.400
It's just drawn on
so it's easy to wipe off.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.440
It's quite a struggle
to get it on properly.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.840
That black lines are black
and grey ones are grey.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.760
Because the quality of the tattoo reduces,
you must create it...

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.760
...so that it represents the clients' idea.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.120
A painting stays the way it is
but a tattoo reduces with time.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.520
So you have to simplify it.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.480
If you make a realistic tattoo,
it will start reducing from day one.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.200
That's why it's key to make it
more simple, to take that extra hurdle.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:55.360
An abstract reality which is clearly visible
when it has reduced over time.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.040
Some clothes, and some tattoos,
are made in such a way...

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:13.040
...that they are timeless. When
you can't tell whether it's old or new.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.320
When you can't place your finger on it,
that's when I like it, that's cool.
