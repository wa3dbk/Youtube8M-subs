 Homes inc is this tiny little box 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.350
 which can be very small but 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.369
 actually very much with us 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.350
 now patrick pfaff is the 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.730
 product manager at samsung betrayed it 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.070
 but please what it has on it 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.590
 this is our new product that is 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.029
 homes inc 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.320
 new product from our mobile area 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.609
 and I would just give you that today 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.810
 like to introduce and a little bit 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.309
 explain what you can do with it 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.770
 once short of Beck so holmes are 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.850
 for dubbing so at home 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.950
 Maybe you can understand this once 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.079
 explain why the device is called so accurate 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.850
 that is, because you actually have something 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.800
 sync my can 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.110
 at home with the equipment on the way 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.579
 while he has a 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.989
 ingredient of the product that is 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.539
 for example on the road when I'm mach 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.440
 a nice photo with my smartphone 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:53.579
 then it will not just be on the 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.500
 device is saved and it will 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.280
 syncs with this box the too 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.280
 home stands with me 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.520
 the establishment of the three is 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.440
 actually super easy there is one 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.970
 nfc-chip in it means if I am now 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.000
 once smartphone got that up 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.500
 put on it because I immediately on the still 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.290
 with this app immediately opened with the 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.310
 I then this box tax is on yes 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.930
 to put it right then it will be needed 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.060
 the app is still installed and after that 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.860
 I can then use the device immediately 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.350
 because the two then easy 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.580
 pair so to say yes only with the 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.140
 phone or is it synonymous with others 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.399
 devices at the moment it goes with the s4 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.630
 but will be on others later 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.119
 Devices also work on the 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.149
 tablets and of course at some point 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.190
 with our new galaxy s 4 zoom because 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.780
 so that one is on the go also makes many 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.330
 Pictures probably and there we have 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.250
 also here enough space ok then show me 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.740
 but please a little demonstration 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.360
 we can do all of this 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.190
 Let's just do that for now 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.490
 are on the way to make a nice trip 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.860
 photo 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.229
 after this photo of you do a lot 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:06.450
 like to judge 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:08.429
 Ok and she's so the picture is taken 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.560
 now i hope that's it too 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.959
 the picture works too fast 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.400
 say upload is thus with this 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.840
 box okay that means open now there 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.489
 this app can then because the photo 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.290
 upload and then it would have to be automatic 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.970
 that too is automatic and that has 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.230
 I pretended I want that 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.060
 if I have a picture here do it 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.130
 automatically uploaded to the box 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.260
 he okay and so I have just this 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.380
 smartphone here with this control and 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.350
 It can almost serve as a mouse 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.290
 assentis has worked now then 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:42.299
 our content 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:43.859
 We do not want to do that big 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.450
 So not working so with with 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:46.920
 images but also with a video, the 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.930
 I do that on the road I can too 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.959
 Just upload it to the box at home 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.730
 can be really easy at home now 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.650
 I am watching or am traveling 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.810
 maybe they have family at home 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.900
 finally the current very short times hello 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.900
 say 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.780
 I 've just seen it 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.360
 I think that's a bit more 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.770
 wiggle 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.930
 what if the new features are what 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.520
 the thing is still accurate so it is 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.720
 not just about cloud, how about it? 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.200
 have said but also one 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.670
 mediaplayer so two products in one 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.530
 and I 've shown it for a while already 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.290
 I can then as I said with this 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.640
 Mobile phone control the device here and 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.990
 So basically we have that 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.910
 I show different areas 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.250
 just a moment 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.020
 I have an area up here 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.670
 recommendations that is to say here 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.310
 Recommendations made for new movies 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.720
 example the one on the samsung video 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.310
 You can also download then 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.350
 can borrow or buy 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.300
 I then have the area above mine 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.340
 content here so all things will be 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.440
 I also show the box 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.910
 that did not save in just synonymous 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.180
 this private area 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.710
 accessible to all and I have a the 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.120
 classic menu how to do it today 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.770
 from us from smartphones or tablets 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.840
 we know are again all apps 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.500
 currently listed on this box 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.500
 are installed 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.040
 okay you can see a whole lot of apps 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.290
 that too looks a bit like 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.210
 android I'm quite correct that 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.580
 android as we do today with us 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.870
 on the whole mobile phones and tablets 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.310
 we also have here on android 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.010
 set wanted to say simply so are 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.660
 we are the most flexible and harmonious 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.390
 easy with the other devices of 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.250
 That means that I too can be quite used to it 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.740
 as I already did the smartphone 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.450
 know autumn that are missing here today 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.580
 I would like to use for music 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.110
 to listen to videos to watch 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.670
 also install yourself again 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.870
 or just for example 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.180
 I already use familiar apps 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.830
 know how youtube for example can here 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.180
 my whole youtube videos are watching the 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.680
 I do not know and do not have to 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.060
 this little smartphone screen 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.890
 limit me but can really 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.530
 Enjoying on the couch in front of the house 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.840
 big tv makes the homestake app 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.270
 So the mobile also from what can that 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.530
 still exactly so i can like us 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.050
 have already seen with my finger 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.880
 so to speak then control the homebox and 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.020
 See it on the TV too 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.730
 but do not want to because it is for 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.660
 example too inaccurate or maybe too 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.820
 difficult to use 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.410
 It can also take the second mode 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.120
 then i can do it shortly 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.330
 show that is the so-called more 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.190
 space from what happened there 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.690
 in principle then the picture of the 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.130
 tv what i have on the tv 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:33.710
 see again on the smartphone 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:36.360
 and you can see that here 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.670
 not the tv picture and then i can 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.620
 the homebox as I am used to 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.300
 my smartphone just with my 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.100
 finger so serve bye 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.930
 remote controls bye remote control 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.040
 perfect and you could have me right away 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.990
 also the things you on the 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.190
 Handy also looks on the screen 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.600
 So you can almost see that 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.850
 bring the TV to your mobile phone 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.040
 how does it look the other way round? 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.660
 What do we call a primary ring ? 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.210
 that means I can do something to someone 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.500
 Do not just want to show privately at home 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.450
 in the living room something on my cellphone 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.190
 I can basically do the same 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.480
 this picture on the tv mirror 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:09.020
 and that we can look at us again 

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.020
 together 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:28.889
 now seen so many things 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.419
 which are almost totally innovative and this 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:31.800
 not at the market yet 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:33.120
 does it look like with the box out there 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.139
 who can already or when 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.560
 we ourselves in the living room 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:36.840
 put 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.610
 no , we do not yet exist 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.139
 but now after the ifa start that 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.490
 to bring product to market because we 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:42.870
 find it a great product and 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:46.130
 That's why you want it with everyone 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.130
 That's what I hope
