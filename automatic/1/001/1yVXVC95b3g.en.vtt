00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 davis is the administrator of this farm 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.830
 and the technical assistance 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.650
 is being planted a little 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.269
 late in the month of February and 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.660
 It would have been that she was going to be 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.390
 been planted until December because this 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.010
 late planting before afternoon which is not the case 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.340
 which we enjoy an area was 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.650
 planted in it here to make silage, right? 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.560
 so how did you make me do silage now? 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.260
 who started planting coffee at 50 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.020
 thousand seedlings made on the farm itself 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.270
 were ready for planting then no 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.969
 had another way they had to be 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.120
 planted even during the single summer in 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.090
 only a week the soil they already felt 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.879
 the effects of heat and lack of rain 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.840
 the eyes surround and lose their 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.059
 leaves until you reach the nage risk even 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.100
 to lose the change of pernambuco nor death 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.620
 groups to try to solve the problem 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.750
 drought plant producers 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.780
 using a technique chosen by gel 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.270
 irrigation the product is still little used 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.100
 farmers in the region to 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.740
 start the application the product is 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:15.119
 mixed in water and davies blended 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.189
 70 grams in the gel in 700 liters of water at 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.080
 mix takes half an hour the best 25 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.570
 to be ready that we already understand 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.659
 has been here for about 20 minutes. 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.460
 water is already getting very viscous going 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.869
 be applied in daily 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.280
 we will apply and 12 hectares is 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.200
 average 1 3 book per paper 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.020
 at first it will be an application to 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.750
 an application principle and moisturises the gel 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.409
 from five to six days until the 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.720
 rainy as a cat extended the gel does 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.030
 with which the water is retained near the 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.189
 change root for longer 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.610
 the staff comes forward opening a 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.030
 space with making it 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.820
 plant the tractor right after and behind 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.340
 the game product is applied with 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.470
 advantage of taking the gel 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.420
 now we use the gel is that in the region 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.610
 of any album at low index 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.870
 rainfall is below average in the 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.140
 south region of mines 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:13.450
 then this one already use to avoid kapon 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.000
 the plant has a stress damage 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.420
 and water with addition of damage has 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.900
 was it reduces water loss by 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:27.430
 evaporation and evaporation leaching 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:30.100
 sweat leaching beyond it will make 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.820
 better root development and 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.800
 was and with that it is to reduce the rate also 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.290
 report that has a study showing the 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.120
 cup rate fell from 10 to 2 percent 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.620
 so the labor force could 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.489
 make available to other areas of the 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.980
 farm 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.520
 We take it from here and send it to others. 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.140
 trenches 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.480
 today it also reduces the number of 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.459
 irrigation and reduces this reduced gel 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.160
 number of connections around 20 to 50 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:57.610
 for example you can increase the pitch and 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.799
 right time and the amount of irrigation 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.560
 also the seedlings are being 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:05.140
 planted on 12 hectares of land 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.110
 gel application will reduce from 20 to 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.989
 50 percent the need for irrigation 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.090
 if it is necessary to apply once 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.519
 then if it rains you do not need to apply 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.769
 more if you apply once you see it 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.269
 need to apply apply twice 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.519
 with the product then do not need to apply 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:24.310
 more only with a normal relationship with the 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:27.310
 own water and it is already active again 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.230
 product and is already the product itself. 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.750
 jah insures the penetration of water into the soil 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.640
 and water does not quickly penetrate a 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.220
 loop device 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.739
 but even with the benefits of gel the 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:42.010
 technologist of the coffee cooperative of three 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:44.890
 points out that nothing replaces the rain of 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:48.579
 The truth is that there are many situations 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:51.549
 people have used it 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:54.819
 the plant step better by these 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:56.920
 the defendant well in this function 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:00.519
 so we also work with the jet 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.980
 pilot and what is done escaped near the canopy 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:05.499
 planting is another form of 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.599
 this irrigation ideal was used here 

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:10.689
 In this case, the producer is 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:13.120
 making later planting and was made 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:15.010
 a mechanized planting then not having 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.519
 we had like the general little people in the 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.519
 planting
