00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.050
 i 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:20.730
 there is what to do when a dog 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.919
 and when he chokes or 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.750
 consume any chemical 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:27.599
 Do you know how to provide the first 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.020
 help the veterinary silvia trinity 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.020
 teaches with maggi in every situation 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.020
 check out 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.600
 is very important in this case of 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.100
 trampling the person pay 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.050
 attention to inform the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.999
 the animal has lost its 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.620
 consciousness or he fainted soon 

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:49.199
 after running over 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.899
 and if he opined and if he defecated this is 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:53.579
 nieces were just normal a saint is 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.980
 important to be very careful also to 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.539
 to manipulate this animal was run over 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.519
 He will be in pain then by 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.469
 however meek he may bite 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:02.999
 Ideally, we should love in our mouths before 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.510
 to tinker with it to our own 

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:08.460
 safety and other care is extremely 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.720
 important in handling this animal 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.060
 When we retire, he has a 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.490
 place to take to the vet or to 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.470
 house be very careful with the column 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.480
 both the trunk and the neck 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.610
 people can worsen an injury 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.770
 if we manipulate it too much 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.690
 fainted dog he'll lie down 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.430
 We will not call him, will not he? 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.140
 respond to no stimulus 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.400
 often it looks pink as well 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.770
 branquinha then so we 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.550
 to lower the eye 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.550
 very white 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.229
 when we then saw up to half 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:43.869
 Time is interesting that we induces 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.790
 vote is how we can do it 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.490
 that you can manage water 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.140
 oxygen 10 volumes would be a 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.880
 teaspoon for every five 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.409
 pounds of animal weight 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.119
 This we can do every five 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.580
 minutes two or three times to 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.960
 stimulate the volume this should not be 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.600
 made in the home in which the animal 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.000
 bleach something caustic that the 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.740
 people will burn the same esophagus 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.009
 animal and this will be worse for treating 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.009
 after 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.970
 We can do it at home and just wash the 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.590
 wound with plenty of water and also 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.060
 took as quickly as possible to the 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.540
 veterinarian because we need 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.210
 apply the antivenom serum of the snake very 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.580
 important if possible if the 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.920
 people have applied snake watching 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.320
 able to report the veterinarian as it was 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.540
 cobra and triangular head snakes in 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.250
 general are poisonous but it is important 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.230
 never comes too close to the snake 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.460
 try to kill do not try to capture for the 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.460
 our own security also 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.510
 ronaldo covers more than 20% of the body are 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.480
 considered serious burns and there the 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.340
 animal will have very much effects too 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.560
 serious and we will need rather 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.660
 hospitalization and physiotherapy has the animal 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.550
 will have a lot of liquid loss 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.380
 protein in that burn that people 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.209
 you will need to rest when the 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.160
 burn of less than 20% of the body 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.620
 main problem will only be hurt 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.720
 independent of this in all 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.090
 burn cases interesting at home 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.180
 we wash with running water and water 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.080
 cool is not cool water cool water 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.080
 during the 20 minutes 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.440
 the dog was playing with a 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.570
 ball eating a bone and starts to 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.400
 choke can not breathe 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.680
 we will need to open our mouths and 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.820
 remove the material by hand with 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.590
 a forceps 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.090
 if we can not get the dogs 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.580
 Little ones we can squeeze 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.860
 against the body and tighten the belly yes 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.900
 inside up is that maneuver that 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.250
 makes the country human being choked 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.110
 the big dogs that we do not 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.510
 able to hold on his lap it can be 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.310
 lying on the side we kneel on the side 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.900
 of the dog and with knee does this 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.010
 belly up and down 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.840
 inside too 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.700
 we often see a little animal 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.050
 coughing and believes it to be the 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.150
 choking 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.280
 It is very common for us to receive another 15 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.200
 hospital but as far as it can take 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.420
 several other causes including causes 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.710
 how heart problems need to be 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.780
 of immediate treatment 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.400
 so every little animal comes in is coughing 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.620
 enough should be taken to the veterinarian 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.620
 to be evaluated
