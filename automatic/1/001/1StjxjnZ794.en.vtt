00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
inspiration now we're so to go these two

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.950 
inspiration now we're so to go these two
because<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:13.889> like<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.490> two<00:00:14.880> players<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.330> lot<00:00:15.780> and

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
because I like the two players a lot and

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.830 
because I like the two players a lot and

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
thought combining the two would make

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.670 
thought combining the two would make
things<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.630> little<00:00:21.810> bit<00:00:22.020> more<00:00:22.170> interesting<00:00:22.380> so

can test out and see if is actually good

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.790 
can test out and see if is actually good
in<00:00:32.340> divisions<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.329> Gold<00:00:33.630> Cup<00:00:33.870> if<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.559> a

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
in divisions and the Gold Cup if is a

in divisions and the Gold Cup if is a
gold<00:00:35.130> team<00:00:35.370> so<00:00:35.730> this<00:00:36.300> team<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.960> 352<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.739> it

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
gold team so this team is a 352 and it

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.680 
gold team so this team is a 352 and it

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
because I think he scored about four

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.500 
because I think he scored about four
goals<00:04:58.900> in<00:04:59.080> around<00:04:59.919> six<00:05:00.400> to<00:05:00.550> seven<00:05:00.910> games<00:05:00.940> but

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
goals in around six to seven games but

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.110 
goals in around six to seven games but
