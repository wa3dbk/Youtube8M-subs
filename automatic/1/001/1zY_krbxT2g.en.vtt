what's up you guys people have been

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.330 
what's up you guys people have been
asking<00:00:05.339> me<00:00:05.400> how<00:00:05.819> the<00:00:06.029> hell<00:00:06.480> I've<00:00:06.750> installed<00:00:07.340> my

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
asking me how the hell I've installed my

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.480 
asking me how the hell I've installed my
system<00:00:08.730> in<00:00:08.910> my<00:00:09.120> van<00:00:10.070> keep<00:00:11.070> in<00:00:11.190> mind<00:00:11.370> this

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
system in my van keep in mind this

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.339 
system in my van keep in mind this
actually<00:00:11.820> came<00:00:11.969> off<00:00:12.179> my<00:00:12.360> Honda<00:00:12.870> before<00:00:13.230> I<00:00:13.259> got

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
actually came off my Honda before I got

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.529 
actually came off my Honda before I got
into<00:00:13.559> an<00:00:13.620> accident<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:15.980> pretty<00:00:16.980> much<00:00:17.539> it's

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
into an accident and pretty much it's

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.210 
into an accident and pretty much it's
straightforward<00:00:18.900> honestly<00:00:19.529> on<00:00:19.619> it<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:19.949> on

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
straightforward honestly on it and on

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.349 
straightforward honestly on it and on
this<00:00:20.340> man<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.550> thought<00:00:20.760> was<00:00:20.850> gonna<00:00:20.939> be<00:00:21.090> harder

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
this man I thought was gonna be harder

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.910 
this man I thought was gonna be harder
but<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:21.869> think<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.470> hardest<00:00:22.680> thing<00:00:22.800> was

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
but I think the hardest thing was

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.070 
but I think the hardest thing was
actually<00:00:23.670> knowing<00:00:24.269> what<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.630> run<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.930> power

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
actually knowing what to run the power

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.279 
actually knowing what to run the power
cable<00:00:25.560> from<00:00:26.269> what<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:27.300> did<00:00:27.449> in<00:00:27.840> this<00:00:28.410> one<00:00:28.859> is

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
cable from what I did in this one is

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.810 
cable from what I did in this one is
pretty<00:00:31.289> much<00:00:31.560> run<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.640> cable<00:00:33.540> from<00:00:34.730> under<00:00:35.730> the

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
pretty much run the cable from under the

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.630 
pretty much run the cable from under the
steering<00:00:36.090> wheel<00:00:37.040> towards<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.190> engine<00:00:38.489> bay

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
steering wheel towards the engine bay

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.549 
steering wheel towards the engine bay
and<00:00:38.820> I'll<00:00:39.480> show<00:00:39.629> you<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.989> second

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
and I'll show you that in a second

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:49.760 
and I'll show you that in a second
this<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.610> on<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.960> 2002<00:00:42.960> ford<00:00:43.260> windstar

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.380 

and<00:00:50.930> the<00:00:51.930> wiring<00:00:52.380> on<00:00:52.560> this<00:00:52.800> car<00:00:53.130> is<00:00:53.430> it's<00:00:54.060> 4

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
and the wiring on this car is it's 4

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.910 
and the wiring on this car is it's 4
gauge<00:00:54.630> 4<00:00:55.230> gauge<00:00:55.380> wiring<00:00:56.060> so<00:00:57.650> I'll<00:00:58.650> show<00:00:58.890> you

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
gauge 4 gauge wiring so I'll show you

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.440 
gauge 4 gauge wiring so I'll show you
how<00:00:59.040> how<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.400> did<00:00:59.640> it

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.450 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.560 

so<00:01:03.450> pretty<00:01:03.720> much<00:01:03.960> what<00:01:04.440> I<00:01:04.470> did<00:01:04.740> was<00:01:05.510> there's<00:01:06.510> a

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
so pretty much what I did was there's a

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.260 
so pretty much what I did was there's a
little<00:01:06.780> rubber<00:01:07.290> government<00:01:08.010> right<00:01:08.160> here<00:01:08.520> you

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
little rubber government right here you

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.350 
little rubber government right here you
can<00:01:09.420> pull<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.750> off<00:01:10.610> then<00:01:11.610> you'll<00:01:11.970> see<00:01:12.180> that

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
can pull that off then you'll see that

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.060 
can pull that off then you'll see that
it<00:01:12.660> gives<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.900> access<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.560> outside<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.950> the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
it gives you access to outside of the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.950 
it gives you access to outside of the
engine<00:01:14.430> bay<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:15.120> just<00:01:15.360> feed<00:01:15.690> the<00:01:15.780> wire

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
engine bay you just feed the wire

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.230 
engine bay you just feed the wire
through<00:01:15.990> there<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.860> they<00:01:17.760> should<00:01:17.940> go<00:01:18.060> oh

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
through there and they should go oh

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.990 
through there and they should go oh
shoot<00:01:18.660> it<00:01:18.900> should<00:01:19.620> show<00:01:20.250> up<00:01:20.400> by<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.670> engine

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
shoot it should show up by the engine

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.020 
shoot it should show up by the engine
bay<00:01:21.590> you'll<00:01:22.590> see<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:22.950> by<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.130> filter<00:01:23.760> pretty

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
bay you'll see it by the filter pretty

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.360 
bay you'll see it by the filter pretty
quickly<00:01:24.360> especially<00:01:25.320> depending<00:01:25.710> on<00:01:26.070> what

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370 
quickly especially depending on what

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.460 
quickly especially depending on what
color<00:01:26.550> your<00:01:26.760> cable<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.360> case<00:01:27.750> in<00:01:28.080> this<00:01:28.260> case

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
color your cable is in case in this case

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.120 
color your cable is in case in this case
the<00:01:28.619> mine<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:28.890> red<00:01:29.360> then<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.840> fed<00:01:31.410> then<00:01:31.830> I<00:01:31.920> fed

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
the mine is red then I fed then I fed

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.280 
the mine is red then I fed then I fed
the<00:01:32.220> wiring<00:01:32.580> through<00:01:32.910> the<00:01:33.260> through<00:01:34.260> the

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
has iPod and no not through the

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.430 
has iPod and no not through the
auxiliary<00:02:39.120> it's<00:02:39.540> actually<00:02:40.110> and<00:02:40.230> it's<00:02:40.350> an

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
auxiliary it's actually and it's an

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.130 
auxiliary it's actually and it's an
actual<00:02:40.560> iPod<00:02:41.069> and<00:02:41.280> hook<00:02:41.430> up<00:02:41.580> into<00:02:41.819> it<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:45.140> only

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
actual iPod and hook up into it the only

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.500 
actual iPod and hook up into it the only
wire<00:02:46.740> that<00:02:46.920> this<00:02:47.250> is<00:02:47.400> plugged<00:02:47.640> into<00:02:47.819> the<00:02:48.090> Onyx

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
wire that this is plugged into the Onyx

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.000 
wire that this is plugged into the Onyx
right<00:02:48.690> now<00:02:48.840> so<00:02:49.560> that's<00:02:49.709> how<00:02:49.830> I'm<00:02:49.890> getting

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
right now so that's how I'm getting

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.860 
right now so that's how I'm getting
audio<00:02:51.000> going<00:02:51.150> through<00:02:51.450> there

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.009 

and<00:02:54.620> for<00:02:55.160> the<00:02:55.220> wiring<00:02:55.610> for<00:02:56.330> the<00:02:56.390> xampp

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
and for the wiring for the xampp

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:02.470 
and for the wiring for the xampp
actually<00:02:57.519> took<00:02:58.519> this<00:02:58.819> off<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:01.370> housing<00:03:01.580> took

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
actually took this off the housing took

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.680 
actually took this off the housing took
it<00:03:02.599> off<00:03:02.720> fed<00:03:03.379> the<00:03:03.500> wiring<00:03:03.830> through<00:03:04.099> there<00:03:04.690> so

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
it off fed the wiring through there so

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.270 
it off fed the wiring through there so
the<00:03:05.900> only<00:03:06.019> cable<00:03:06.530> that<00:03:06.620> she<00:03:06.800> used<00:03:06.950> to<00:03:07.010> see<00:03:07.220> is

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
the only cable that she used to see is

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:14.740 
the only cable that she used to see is
really<00:03:07.550> this<00:03:07.760> one<00:03:08.060> that's<00:03:08.540> it<00:03:11.379> and<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:14.540> wiring

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
really this one that's it and the wiring

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.220 
really this one that's it and the wiring
the<00:03:15.620> XM<00:03:16.580> cables<00:03:17.239> you<00:03:17.360> can<00:03:17.390> feed<00:03:17.720> through<00:03:17.959> here

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
the XM cables you can feed through here

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.559 
the XM cables you can feed through here
it<00:03:19.129> should<00:03:19.400> take<00:03:19.640> you<00:03:19.760> no<00:03:19.790> longer<00:03:20.299> than<00:03:20.420> five

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
it should take you no longer than five

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.289 
it should take you no longer than five
minutes<00:03:20.629> really<00:03:21.170> then<00:03:22.129> feeding<00:03:22.640> that<00:03:22.910> there

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
minutes really then feeding that there

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.650 
minutes really then feeding that there
there's<00:03:23.590> pretty<00:03:24.590> quick<00:03:24.890> now<00:03:25.190> you<00:03:26.180> can<00:03:26.329> see

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
there's pretty quick now you can see

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:34.650 
there's pretty quick now you can see
that<00:03:28.660> you<00:03:29.660> can<00:03:29.840> see<00:03:30.049> the<00:03:30.319> X<00:03:30.530> am<00:03:31.269> is<00:03:32.269> right<00:03:32.599> there

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
that you can see the X am is right there

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.770 
that you can see the X am is right there
see<00:03:35.660> if<00:03:35.750> I<00:03:35.810> can<00:03:35.989> focus<00:03:36.140> into<00:03:36.680> that<00:03:37.239> it's<00:03:38.239> kind

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
see if I can focus into that it's kind

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:45.580 
see if I can focus into that it's kind
of<00:03:39.910> right<00:03:40.910> there's<00:03:41.120> the<00:03:41.239> X<00:03:41.360> on<00:03:41.540> McKenna<00:03:44.590> let's

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
of right there's the X on McKenna let's

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.860 
of right there's the X on McKenna let's
go<00:03:45.890> to<00:03:47.170> wish<00:03:48.170> for<00:03:48.200> you<00:03:48.860> the<00:03:49.099> wire<00:03:50.060> the<00:03:50.569> wiring

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
go to wish for you the wire the wiring

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.050 
go to wish for you the wire the wiring
is<00:03:50.989> also<00:03:51.290> right<00:03:51.500> here<00:03:51.530> to<00:03:53.019> you<00:03:54.019> feed<00:03:54.319> the<00:03:55.060> power

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
is also right here to you feed the power

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:03.849 
is also right here to you feed the power
cables<00:03:56.480> for<00:03:56.569> through<00:03:56.780> there<00:04:02.440> and<00:04:03.440> it's<00:04:03.650> hidden

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:03.859 
cables for through there and it's hidden

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:05.740 
cables for through there and it's hidden
through<00:04:04.100> there<00:04:04.250> too<00:04:04.459> you<00:04:05.150> actually<00:04:05.510> have<00:04:05.630> to

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
through there too you actually have to

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.970 
through there too you actually have to
remove<00:04:05.810> this<00:04:06.170> to<00:04:06.530> get<00:04:06.680> to<00:04:06.829> it

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:18.970 

should<00:04:11.460> be<00:04:11.580> easy<00:04:13.069> the<00:04:14.069> awesome<00:04:14.340> of<00:04:14.580> this<00:04:17.720> and

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 
should be easy the awesome of this and

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.470 
should be easy the awesome of this and
in<00:04:19.980> my<00:04:20.100> case<00:04:20.220> actually<00:04:20.670> had<00:04:21.000> showed<00:04:21.209> a<00:04:21.329> little

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
in my case actually had showed a little

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.670 
in my case actually had showed a little
wiring<00:04:21.720> because<00:04:22.079> it<00:04:22.170> was<00:04:22.260> kind<00:04:22.410> of<00:04:22.440> hard<00:04:22.620> to

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
wiring because it was kind of hard to

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.220 
wiring because it was kind of hard to
pass<00:04:22.950> it<00:04:23.130> through<00:04:23.160> there<00:04:23.460> so<00:04:24.450> that's<00:04:24.990> where

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
pass it through there so that's where

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:38.810 
pass it through there so that's where
mine<00:04:25.470> is<00:04:25.500> right<00:04:25.920> here<00:04:35.660> and<00:04:37.130> here's<00:04:38.130> my<00:04:38.340> speaker

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
mine is right here and here's my speaker

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.480 
mine is right here and here's my speaker
set<00:04:39.060> it<00:04:39.810> consists<00:04:40.350> of<00:04:40.410> two<00:04:40.590> to<00:04:40.770> two<00:04:41.250> times

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
set it consists of two to two times

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:47.930 
set it consists of two to two times
right<00:04:41.640> now<00:04:42.680> plan<00:04:43.680> on<00:04:43.830> upgrading<00:04:44.010> to<00:04:46.220> two<00:04:47.220> 15s

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
right now plan on upgrading to two 15s

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.770 
right now plan on upgrading to two 15s
hopefully<00:04:48.480> by<00:04:48.840> the<00:04:48.900> end<00:04:49.020> of<00:04:49.230> the<00:04:49.290> year<00:04:50.720> with<00:04:51.720> a

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
hopefully by the end of the year with a

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.960 
hopefully by the end of the year with a
bigger<00:04:52.080> amp<00:04:53.000> right<00:04:54.000> now<00:04:54.150> I'm<00:04:54.390> running<00:04:54.990> a

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
bigger amp right now I'm running a

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.940 
bigger amp right now I'm running a
lightning<00:04:56.970> audio<00:04:57.270> amp<00:04:57.540> and<00:04:57.960> if<00:04:58.710> you<00:04:58.800> guys

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
lightning audio amp and if you guys

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.430 
lightning audio amp and if you guys
don't<00:04:59.190> know<00:04:59.250> what<00:04:59.340> Lightning<00:05:00.270> audio<00:05:00.570> is<00:05:00.810> it's

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
don't know what Lightning audio is it's

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.409 
don't know what Lightning audio is it's
pretty<00:05:01.890> much<00:05:02.100> a<00:05:02.160> Rockford<00:05:02.610> Fosgate<00:05:02.760> amp

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
pretty much a Rockford Fosgate amp

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:08.350 
pretty much a Rockford Fosgate amp
because<00:05:05.060> Rockford<00:05:06.060> owns<00:05:06.300> that<00:05:06.510> brand<00:05:07.040> and

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
because Rockford owns that brand and

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.750 
because Rockford owns that brand and
there<00:05:09.360> goes<00:05:09.510> my<00:05:09.720> 12<00:05:10.050> gauge<00:05:10.320> wire<00:05:10.350> not<00:05:11.340> like<00:05:11.490> 12

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
there goes my 12 gauge wire not like 12

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.670 
there goes my 12 gauge wire not like 12
gauge<00:05:12.110> 4<00:05:13.110> gauge<00:05:13.350> watering<00:05:14.540> and<00:05:15.590> people<00:05:16.590> were

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
gauge 4 gauge watering and people were

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.210 
gauge 4 gauge watering and people were
asking<00:05:17.600> where<00:05:18.600> the<00:05:18.690> hell<00:05:18.840> am<00:05:19.050> I<00:05:19.229> going<00:05:19.530> for<00:05:20.130> the

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
asking where the hell am I going for the

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.870 
asking where the hell am I going for the
ground<00:05:21.200> so<00:05:22.200> what<00:05:22.350> I<00:05:22.380> had<00:05:22.590> to<00:05:22.710> do<00:05:22.890> was<00:05:23.520> you<00:05:23.790> have

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
ground so what I had to do was you have

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.350 
ground so what I had to do was you have
to<00:05:24.000> remove<00:05:24.150> the<00:05:24.330> seat<00:05:24.600> to<00:05:24.900> get<00:05:25.020> enough<00:05:25.560> access

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
to remove the seat to get enough access

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.300 
to remove the seat to get enough access
to<00:05:27.360> get<00:05:27.479> to<00:05:27.600> the<00:05:27.690> ground<00:05:27.930> and<00:05:28.140> pretty<00:05:29.130> much

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
to get to the ground and pretty much

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.200 
to get to the ground and pretty much
what<00:05:30.210> you're<00:05:30.330> gonna<00:05:30.450> do<00:05:30.660> is<00:05:31.130> see<00:05:32.130> that<00:05:32.340> see

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
what you're gonna do is see that see

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.930 
what you're gonna do is see that see
that<00:05:33.240> bolt<00:05:33.540> right<00:05:33.660> there<00:05:34.370> pretty<00:05:35.370> much<00:05:35.580> what

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
that bolt right there pretty much what
