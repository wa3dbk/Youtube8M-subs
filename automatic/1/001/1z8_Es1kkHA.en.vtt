00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.130
 even if it's winter this year 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.110
 with us car drivers are well meant 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.830
 constant spring temperatures always 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.690
 welcome 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.340
 who at rising temperatures in the 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.830
 spring still with winter tires on the way 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.210
 is expected to have longer braking distances 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.970
 Winterize with your soft 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.160
 Gum mixture on the cold season 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.840
 designed for warmer outdoor temperatures 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.550
 It can be a spongy driving experience 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.199
 and increased wear 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.820
 winter has come this year 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.470
 passed much earlier than we did 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.360
 that all expected that is for 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.559
 us car driver but also it is time to 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.360
 change summer tires 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.190
 Today we want to see if it makes sense 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.239
 does this have to do with the stockist what 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.120
 we get our money 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.129
 More and more drivers are giving up 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.649
 Tire change on your own and use 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.750
 the offer of the specialist workshops especially 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.280
 They often small money equal 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.379
 Two flies strike with one stone 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.940
 when spring is coming 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.860
 not just the winter tires and down 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.899
 the summer tires are reared 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.430
 This is also a good time 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.760
 vehicle to a thorough check too 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.699
 subject 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.199
 at a spring check we check to 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:08.460
 for example, all security relevant 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.180
 Things the brake we test all 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.799
 liquids such as 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.729
 Cooling water engine oil and brake fluid 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.530
 before the winter tires in the 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:18.820
 summer break should be sent 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.310
 check if you have one more season 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.970
 persevere or renewed if necessary 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.130
 Need to become 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.770
 of course that also applies to the now in 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.570
 action kick the summer tire the 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.280
 we investigate for damage we 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.170
 want to know or retracted 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.440
 foreign bodies and controls the age 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.479
 as well as their profile depth only mature 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.700
 with sufficient profile depth that is 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.600
 at least 3 mm offer maximum 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.729
 driving safety 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.280
 to qualify for the tire choice a bit too 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.750
 there are now easier 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.490
 Orientation A good first 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.450
 decision support brings the new 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:56.140
 eu-label what looks like three at first sight 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.940
 highlights important criteria such as 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.369
 Example with a drink tire 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.319
 the new goodyear efficient grip 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.899
 performance of the home from very good 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:06.340
 level continues to bring with it 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.470
 On-site consultation is still available 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.840
 useful because the tire label forms only 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.340
 Three criteria of a maturity based on 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.319
 the wishes and requirements of the customer 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.290
 Can he qualify say which 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.090
 mature best fits so that the 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.620
 winter tires stand over the summer book 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.209
 the specialized trade also offers the 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.640
 possibility of storage 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.050
 because only with professional bearings and 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.540
 the mature stays for the next one too 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.700
 winter prepared even when s mature 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.319
 There is always something to buy everywhere 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.090
 still sense to visit my dealer 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.769
 when it comes to the new tire or around 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.269
 the tire change because they look easy 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.590
 more than the layman and above all things 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:40.480
 have the right tool and the 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.459
 equipment to order even under the car 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.080
 So, really, you're looking at every mistake 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.080
 the entrance of the summer is corrected
