00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:07.959
 Goodmorning everyone 

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:13.110
 this short guide wants to show me how to create folders to protect 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.140
 content 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.539
 all here fait we want 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:18.810
 protect from prying eyes 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.679
 in mac os x the help 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:25.210
 laion la provides a function via id utility disco tao 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.470
 that do nothing but 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.470
 let us create an image disk 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:36.690
 but that is protected by an actor encryption system with a password a 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.340
 our choice 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.400
 the first thing to do is to create a new folder 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.740
 rename it this 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.740
 example I will call it a fordert exercise bike 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.890
 where inside we will go to 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.980
 drag place on the type of file we want to protect 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.640
 then through the spot light we look for utility discs that at this time 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.080
 since it was already there 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.090
 disk utility 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.090
 select new image 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.710
 in the first string save as we are obviously entering the name 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.320
 of our folder 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.400
 located in me where 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.510
 logically we will go and save our file 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.230
 disc image name this is our mario choice 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.210
 and now the same name 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.520
 dimensions here gives us the possibility to choose the maximum size the 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.000
 maximum capacity 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.050
 for the fact that we are going to create in practice the file that will create I was an ex 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.200
 lax mac file of mac applications which has a .dmg 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.760
 I will now lower it to 40 friend who are more than sufficient for this 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.680
 test 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.140
 what is important 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.010
 of the codification 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.210
 the coding for where we are going to select the type of encryption that 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.350
 recommended is the classic 128 bit 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.340
 instead the string format format for gay image formats or advice from 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.559
 leave it as it is set by default 

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:11.559
 so let's create 

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:16.249
 and here is where precisely the system asks us to set a password for 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:18.309
 this folder 

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:23.879
 you will see that as you say then we type your password this 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.799
 bar will become colored which will show us 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.799
 the complexity of the password they entered 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:34.459
 my believe at the moment is just enough but 

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:37.559
 now it's not okay 

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:41.099
 What was very important was to select this box 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.309
 stores the keychain password 

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:48.519
 because sine in waves very carefully selected this box 

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:55.769
 mfc will memorize our passion for key rings and whenever anyone 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:01.399
 times to return to our folder that we would like. to protect 

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:04.689
 in reality he will have no difficulty in entering it 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:09.439
 because the mac will automatically fill in the easter field 

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:14.559
 then we deselect store the keychain password and let's say you were 

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:20.589
 now on the desk 

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:23.589
 the visible 

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:26.559
 the mac created 

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:31.759
 the main cyclette folder .dmg file where it has already opened and opened 

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:34.229
 disk image I buy 

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:36.749
 we open disk imaging 

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:40.889
 that obviously empty here we can see the maximum dimension that we 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:43.799
 we have posted previously 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.799
 and let's import we are going to insert 

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:50.309
 all the files we want to protect 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:02.119
 ok they were copied we can close 

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:03.629
 excrete 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:07.059
 disk image 

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:09.029
 when we're going to open 

00:04:09.029 --> 00:04:11.279
 the main dmg files 

00:04:11.279 --> 00:04:14.279
 will ask us for the password 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.449
 we give ok 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:19.150
 that is for disk image 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.279
 open image disk compartment and here it is 

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:26.749
 our files therefore whenever we want to insert new files not 

00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:31.719
 we will do or else to open our dmg file enter the password open disk 

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:34.009
 equitrek drag image 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:35.889
 all the files we want 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:38.039
 to protect 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:41.770
 important thing to remember to delete the 

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:48.199
 the original file because otherwise it would take a copy 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:51.080
 unsecured is visible to all 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.070
 well she is still a fairly quick and simple system 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.120
 sure 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.039
 I hope you have been helpful I thank you and refer you the next
