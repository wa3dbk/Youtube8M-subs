00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:01.719
 the kidneys 

00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:05.019
 they take out the waste products of cellular activity 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.850
 by means of urine 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.470
 and also help to control the level of certain elements necessary for the 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.580
 body like water mineral salts and other substances 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.359
 when different living beings break down proteins 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.050
 nitrogen-containing wastes are produced and are poisonous 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.689
 that's why they need to eliminate those from their bodies 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.530
 A) Yes 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.380
 the fish expel them in the form of ammonia 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.050
 pouring them directly into the water where they are quickly diluted 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.620
 birds and reptiles expel these compounds in the form of uric acid with 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.770
 very little water concentration 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.000
 able to run statues or paint cars 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.690
 mammals in turn hear this waste in the form of urea to 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.690
 through urine 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.620
 I 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.440
 all and all the impurities of the blood 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.250
 keep its salinity constant 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.020
 as well as maintaining the balance of other substances vital to the 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.970
 organism are the complex missions that the kidneys deal with 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.440
 it is prodigious that these tiny organs of just 150 grams each 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.440
 follow the organism's cleansing system 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.520
 the two kidneys of the human body 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.390
 are housed in the back of the I-connected arteries with veins and 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.390
 with the tubes that lead the urine to the neighbor 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.590
 The inside of the kidney has a complex structure that allows it to 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.590
 perform your mission with a high level of efficiency 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:16.689
 they are formed by small functional units called composite nephrons 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:20.669
 by a steer of capillaries called plumer um bloc wrapped in a kind 

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:22.889
 of company mada capsule of pomán 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:25.099
 located in the cortex of the kidney 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:26.800
 and for a long u-shaped tube 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.800
 surrounded by small veins and arteries 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:37.719
 each kidney contains approximately one million more meters 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:42.510
 which are distributed in such an organized way and take advantage of 

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:44.709
 also the available space 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.909
 because if we were to hold supplies in a straight line 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:51.469
 they would have a length equivalent to that of 5 thousand cars 

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:58.769
 it was the mission of the anef round 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.790
 is to filter the blood that reaches the capillaries of number one located in the 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.479
 inside of the pomán capsule 

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:10.039
 there all the elements of the blood are absorbed except for those of 

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:14.449
 large size like red blood cells and proteins that are kept in the 

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:17.449
 blood circulation 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.450
 here we see a gomero captured with an electron microscope 

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:31.099
 ect the filtered liquid peace then running along the 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:32.159
 tube shaped 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:34.259
 although the reform 

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:38.329
 the walls of these tubes have special cells that reabsorb 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:41.149
 those substances that the body needs 

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:42.469
 like glucose 

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:46.279
 and return them to the blood in a process of selecting a precision 

00:03:46.279 --> 00:03:49.189
 amazing 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:54.089
 some substances such as water and mineral salts are reabsorbed only in 

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:57.909
 the amounts necessary to maintain the internal balance of the body 

00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:04.489
 among the substances that need to be eliminated 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.179
 There is the cellar 

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:10.399
 a compound that produces the liver as a waste product from the consumption of 

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:12.319
 proteins 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.339
 others as the drugs are only partly reabsorbed 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.739
 as elements are returned to the blood 

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:25.529
 the remaining liquid is turned into urine 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.430
 when the urine comes out of those purifying plants that are the kidneys 

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:34.650
 already contains only useless products for the organism 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:41.860
 human kidneys filter about 180 liters of water daily and most of 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.229
 it is reabsorbed 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:46.229
 just liter and a half passed the urine 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.499
 the urine comes out of the kidneys through a delegated tubes called v3 

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:55.599
 that drip it drop by drop in a tank at the bottom of the pubis 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:00.969
 where it is stored until it is expelled to the outside through the 

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:03.969
 urethra 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:10.039
 the water gains and losses of the body are continually changing 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:14.909
 and yet the concentration of their body fluids remains constant 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:18.830
 thanks to the work of partially autonomous kidneys 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.449
 but also controlled by the brain through hormones 

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:30.659
 nature would not have taken the trouble to design two organs of 

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:31.839
 filtration 

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:34.259
 if they were not of capital importance 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:37.259
 for the organism 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.110
 6 the inia 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.669
 gives 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:46.839
 usually 

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:51.229
 The kidneys function with exceptional efficiency in their difficult task of 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:54.669
 monitor the internal balance of our body fluids 

00:05:59.529 --> 00:06:03.269
 but sometimes there are faults in the elimination of urine 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:08.689
 often the salts form stones that obstruct the passage of urine in the 

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:09.400
 bladder 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.550
 or through the ubetenses and cause intense colors 

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:17.279
 it's an old problem since stones have been found in Egyptian mummies 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:23.300
 in some cases they are surgically removed 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.289
 but currently other techniques such as ultrasound and in the 

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:32.160
 be to spray the stones and restore normal urine 

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:40.580
 kidney failure is much more serious 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.780
 when the kidneys stop working 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.650
 the body can not eliminate its waste and poisoning occurs 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:48.589
 progressive organism 

00:06:48.589 --> 00:06:51.849
 because if it's not treated it inevitably leads to death 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:57.119
 in these cases, porphyria hemodialysis is used in artificial 

00:06:57.119 --> 00:07:01.339
 a device that artificially filters blood from outside the body 

00:07:01.339 --> 00:07:04.339
 imitating the work of the kidney 

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:10.939
 for it 

00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:15.309
 for two or three nights a week the patient's blood is filtered through 

00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:19.699
 of a membrane whose forums are similar to those of the capillaries of the 

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:21.210
 capsule of the anef round 

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:24.149
 and so the necessary elements are retained 

00:07:24.149 --> 00:07:27.149
 and the waste is eliminated 

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:30.110
 for these patients 

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:33.889
 there is only one way to free them from their continued dependence on 

00:07:33.889 --> 00:07:35.430
 hemodialysis 

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:38.569
 kidney transplant 

00:07:38.569 --> 00:07:42.789
 the kidney is the organ of the body that was successfully transplanted before 

00:07:42.789 --> 00:07:45.809
 and the organ that transplants most wi-fi 

00:07:45.809 --> 00:07:50.099
 The new drugs that prevent rejection have greatly increased the 

00:07:50.099 --> 00:07:53.099
 survival of these patients 

00:07:56.249 --> 00:08:00.339
 the kidneys are the regulators of fluid balance and the system of 

00:08:00.339 --> 00:08:02.849
 cleaning of our organism 

00:08:02.849 --> 00:08:07.470
 thanks to them we have been able to adapt to life outside the water where 

00:08:07.469 --> 00:08:09.369
 our ancestors left 

00:08:09.369 --> 00:08:11.249
 many millions of years ago
