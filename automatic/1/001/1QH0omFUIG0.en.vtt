00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160
 right at the end kononenko and there is one 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.880
 dissolve 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.880
 a note of 14 655 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.009
 as always the same as the jump too 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.020
 He made a tremendous decision, look at the 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:25.140
 loose that has made extended body has 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.750
 made the loose with the body followed 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.169
 that this complicates a lot more changes the 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.169
 lower 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.510
 and again 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.430
 are waiting 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.040
 since it has fallen to the rhythm 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.750
 that connection 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.750
 if it has been a bit stuck 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.679
 the one that bends on the plate 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.700
 dueling 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.360
 go loose he has done 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.790
 body extended to the pirouette complicates 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.350
 this is going to sanction things for now 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.190
 two final and in both until the 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.190
 french alize cornet 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.970
 will not be then in the same bar that 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.970
 ground 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.800
 then how it changes now is centered a 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.150
 little bit more of the band that has 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:45.050
 separated low 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.050
 to the band 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.220
 what does the change blindly also 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.860
 the position in the changes of course 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.860
 It is very correct and 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.340
 if it is permanently vertical 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.620
 they give 850 execution 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:43.060
 It also varies in the output obviously 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.590
 and seek a place on the podium me 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.470
 I imagine that the bronze nothing else because 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.940
 there is the peculiar loose I do not know if it 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.890
 the coach has touched if he has touched 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:55.650
 the coach that maybe 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.940
 that's why the note was delayed but if 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.850
 has touched the coach would have a 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.740
 address I think not but in case 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.190
 perhaps these cameras are sometimes very 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.190
 little girls 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.250
 because she has not stopped if she has not 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:11.950
 stopped his flight 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.640
 if I had noticed a lot of exercise has 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.640
 a tremendous difficulty 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:25.510
 and the 680 difficulty note the same 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.510
 note that the one to start I'm from 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:32.349
 will differentiate the execution 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:37.080
 but the difficulty of your fornet now 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:39.840
 they give it to him in 616 80 exact 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.210
 and only two years master 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.910
 experience the years he has been doing 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:47.520
 what I do not know that this girl is 17 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.780
 years and elizabeth is 25 knows how to get 9 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.780
 years of experience 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.790
 they do not give it as fixed yet something is 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.790
 deciding 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:10.310
 680 enjoy 815 dismissals 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.310
 the French 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.560
 Y 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.820
 in something that you have blocked 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.320
 computers or who want to see the 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.320
 repetition of the exercise that sometimes 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.880
 Well, we love you 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.449
 by the repetition of sustenance 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:56.229
 there they have it penalized 050 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.229
 effectively that video point
