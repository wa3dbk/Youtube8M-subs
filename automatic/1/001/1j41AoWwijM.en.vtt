00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:04.709 
pretty high and I'd like to put together

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:07.339 
pretty high and I'd like to put together
you<00:02:05.399> know<00:02:05.459> a<00:02:05.490> few<00:02:05.759> more<00:02:05.970> wins<00:02:06.149> in<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.539> row<00:02:06.569> try<00:02:07.289> to

00:02:07.339 --> 00:02:07.349 
you know a few more wins in a row try to

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:12.740 
you know a few more wins in a row try to
get<00:02:07.560> into<00:02:07.799> masters<00:02:08.190> league<00:02:11.299> first<00:02:12.299> season<00:02:12.660> I

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
get into masters league first season I

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.289 
get into masters league first season I
played<00:02:12.959> perhaps<00:02:13.530> second<00:02:14.099> season<00:02:14.670> I<00:02:14.910> played

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
played perhaps second season I played

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.740 
played perhaps second season I played
mostly<00:02:16.290> zerg<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:17.030> both<00:02:18.030> of<00:02:18.060> those<00:02:18.269> were<00:02:18.540> at

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
mostly zerg and both of those were at

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.319 
mostly zerg and both of those were at
diamond<00:02:19.260> level<00:02:19.410> so<00:02:21.349> it's<00:02:22.349> about<00:02:22.620> time<00:02:22.860> that<00:02:22.890> I

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:23.329 
diamond level so it's about time that I

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:25.660 
diamond level so it's about time that I
sit<00:02:24.329> with<00:02:24.480> my<00:02:24.599> game<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:24.870> little<00:02:24.989> bit<00:02:25.200> and

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
sit with my game a little bit and

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.229 
sit with my game a little bit and
getting<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.849> masterly<00:02:28.849> have<00:02:29.849> a<00:02:29.880> pretty<00:02:30.180> good

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
getting the masterly have a pretty good

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.780 
getting the masterly have a pretty good
understanding<00:02:31.819> of<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:35.040> game<00:02:35.190> itself<00:02:35.519> is<00:02:35.760> just

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
understanding of the game itself is just

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.210 
understanding of the game itself is just
mechanics<00:02:36.540> that<00:02:37.430> probably<00:02:38.430> keep<00:02:38.639> me<00:02:38.760> out<00:02:40.220> and

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
mechanics that probably keep me out and

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.930 
mechanics that probably keep me out and
you<00:02:41.489> know<00:02:41.549> macro<00:02:42.180> macro<00:02:42.359> macro<00:02:43.100> so<00:02:44.100> she<00:02:44.670> is<00:02:44.760> in

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
you know macro macro macro so she is in

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.210 
you know macro macro macro so she is in
the<00:02:45.329> north<00:02:45.569> I'm<00:02:45.930> going<00:02:46.170> to<00:02:46.230> go<00:02:46.350> ahead<00:02:46.380> and<00:02:46.650> sit

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
the north I'm going to go ahead and sit

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.860

really depends on positioning if you

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.869 
really depends on positioning if you
don't<00:03:14.860> do<00:03:14.980> it<00:03:15.010> immediately<00:03:15.310> after<00:03:15.790> the

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:15.879 
don't do it immediately after the

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:17.360 
don't do it immediately after the
hatchery<00:03:16.269> you<00:03:16.569> don't<00:03:16.720> really<00:03:16.959> get<00:03:17.110> the

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
hatchery you don't really get the

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.960 
hatchery you don't really get the
benefit<00:03:18.370> from<00:03:18.549> it<00:03:18.730> that<00:03:19.420> could<00:03:19.930> be<00:03:20.760> mining<00:03:21.760> for

benefit from it that could be mining for

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.970 
benefit from it that could be mining for
that<00:03:22.090> much<00:03:22.239> longer<00:03:22.269> so<00:03:23.019> if<00:03:23.170> I<00:03:23.260> forget<00:03:23.560> to<00:03:23.680> do<00:03:23.799> it

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
that much longer so if I forget to do it
