went ahead and evolved it in taking
guard<00:02:39.760> that<00:02:40.540> way<00:02:40.810> I<00:02:41.260> could<00:02:41.709> show<00:02:41.739> its<00:02:41.950> mega

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.129 
guard that way I could show its mega

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:44.910 
guard that way I could show its mega
evolution<00:02:42.610> at<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.760> end<00:02:42.970> so<00:02:43.930> anyway<00:02:44.620> it<00:02:44.769> has

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
evolution at the end so anyway it has

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.660 
evolution at the end so anyway it has
levitated<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.810> it's<00:02:47.500> docile<00:02:48.010> and<00:02:48.430> likes<00:02:48.579> to

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
levitated and it's docile and likes to

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.599 
levitated and it's docile and likes to
thrash<00:02:48.970> about<00:02:52.590> I'll<00:02:53.590> do<00:02:53.920> an<00:02:54.040> encounter<00:02:54.310> and

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
thrash about I'll do an encounter and

00:02:54.609 --> 00:03:01.080 
thrash about I'll do an encounter and
then<00:02:54.700> I'll<00:02:54.790> show<00:02:54.970> it<00:02:55.060> into<00:02:55.209> me<00:02:59.909> normal<00:03:00.909> school
