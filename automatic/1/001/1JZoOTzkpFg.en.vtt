00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:11.530
 good as it says here up 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:16.960
 this video is my first impression of 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:20.400
 be alive that for your love I do not know how to 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.400
 It is called the Mendez 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.690
 sephora for 38 dollars is one single 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.580
 this as you can see look close it seems that 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.680
 well big but very small I was 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.170
 well in one of the big boxes 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.250
 well in a single tone 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.400
 and the price I told you 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.220
 38 dollars in sephora says that fits 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:46.410
 to all types of skin to all types at all 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:50.739
 skin color has 27 solar factor 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.130
 is this drive point 35 ounces or 10 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.130
 grams 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.870
 the one they sell is to finish we 're not going 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:01.590
 because he brings them 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.810
 1.7 ounces 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.210
 I said since it costs 38 dollars and well in 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.850
 a single tone is going to be the video of 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.280
 the first impression of the bicrim I do not 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.530
 what used from mines and carla here 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.870
 they promise says here says first 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.510
 that is obviously used on the face 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:21.960
 clean and I have my moisturizer because 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.650
 I always have a moisturizer though 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.610
 I am a victim unless though 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:31.520
 even in order to show where 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.350
 by laura mercier used moisturizer 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.830
 not be a habit that I have that there 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.360
 here they say 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:44.900
 says that it gives you a finish because the dry ones 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.900
 in Spanish supposedly affirms the skin 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.760
 and the help as an Erasmus, that is, he 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:54.700
 feel more realistic more smooth with the diver 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.290
 it serves to diminish the pores the 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.590
 appearance of pores fine lines 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:03.350
 and for from here to as as all 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.260
 I lived them commit to equal the 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.440
 bull 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:12.750
 the tone then says that supposedly 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.750
 moves it long-term 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.939
 It is a natural coverage 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.050
 and that it disguises imperfections says 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:27.910
 that he applies on the skin 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:30.730
 clean and blur the finger color 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:36.450
 I already told him that only one tone is the 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.450
 thick consistency let's use it 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:42.560
 forever 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.560
 to discover with me 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:52.980
 climbing in the camera well white 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.980
 says that it adjusts skin tone 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.800
 but how we shine 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.660
 remember the clean hands so 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.660
 important 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.890
 for mom 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.319
 the regulation 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.579
 the roots 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.909
 it's important that we do not want it seems that 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:24.610
 we have a mask although I am 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:26.670
 watching and at least 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.910
 and this does not fit my skin tone 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:34.030
 for everyone as well as I am 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.520
 has double a 40 and marc so that 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.070
 use that reference 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.710
 so you know they are quite like 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.540
 I 'm like it's going to appear you have 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:47.740
 a bench even though the combo has those 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:50.080
 staff too and it looks me bounced the 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:54.270
 bounces 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.270
 like when you throw the photo 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:01.110
 let's see if it was like that 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.069
 So far it feels it and I feel 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.360
 that you have nothing 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:08.420
 face 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.380
 a little sticky but I guess it's 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.380
 by the solar factor 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.709
 and I 'm looking at the camera and I do not know 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.600
 if I see myself baby I do not see myself so 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.530
 white here but the camera how to start 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.530
 the white plenary 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.840
 I do not know if you notice those little glitter that 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:31.389
 I say but if I see them 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.389
 They are not many, but they shine like 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.230
 unlike the bicrim another peking that 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:41.200
 they are like breezes, it is not, it is like 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:44.260
 all skin worries me the people that 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.660
 they are darker more claritas than me that 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.200
 maybe as it is I do not know 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.200
 It's me 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.970
 look at my first impression first that 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:56.190
 for me I would not buy it because as 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.380
 which is a reflection something that when you see the 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.280
 video I do not look so white but reflex 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.280
 like more white 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:06.200
 you feel you feel it does not feel like 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.000
 one does not feel it feels like 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.560
 when you put a moisturizer on your skin 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.680
 it is absorbing 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.150
 does not cover 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:18.050
 does not cover 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:22.160
 it does not cover and when I look at it here it does not look 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:26.510
 the only thing that has glitter I do not know if 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:29.390
 that part of the brillito I do not love 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:32.760
 really look 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:35.940
 I spend 38 dollars 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:38.820
 for this moisturizing I do not know it's good to be 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.560
 alive and victim bicrim there is a fever of 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:44.880
 limit 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:47.630
 it scares me that the American brand and if 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.630
 you are American 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.999
 are using bicrim to cover a 

00:05:51.989 --> 00:05:56.399
 moisturizer with a little color I do not know 

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:57.869
 what do you think they leave work in the 

00:05:56.399 --> 00:06:00.019
 comments what you think there 

00:05:57.869 --> 00:06:00.019
 down 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.410
 and 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.020
 this is 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:15.430
 first impression of the voice and to live 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:21.220
 I did not like this one 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.040
 I do not know what for you I do not know I do not know 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:28.620
 I put that covers us the let's be everything 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.620
 to my first impression of 8 a 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:33.389
 two 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.180
 good 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.230
 ah
