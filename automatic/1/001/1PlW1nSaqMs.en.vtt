right this was number three the only
thing<00:00:50.789> faster<00:00:51.140> was<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.379> was<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:54.590> 435

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
thing faster was the was the 435

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
way this car rolled out of the showroom

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.580 
way this car rolled out of the showroom
and<00:02:35.790> that's<00:02:36.300> kind<00:02:36.600> of<00:02:36.660> been<00:02:36.780> preserved<00:02:37.350> that

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
and that's kind of been preserved that

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.520 
and that's kind of been preserved that
way<00:02:38.180> you<00:02:39.180> know<00:02:39.300> redline<00:02:39.870> radials<00:02:40.290> would<00:02:40.410> make

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
way you know redline radials would make

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.530 
way you know redline radials would make
it<00:02:40.680> drive<00:02:40.860> a<00:02:40.890> little<00:02:41.190> nicer<00:02:41.520> but<00:02:41.700> this<00:02:42.240> is<00:02:42.390> the

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
it drive a little nicer but this is the

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.700 
it drive a little nicer but this is the
way<00:02:42.660> it<00:02:42.780> came<00:02:42.930> out<00:02:42.990> man<00:02:43.320> that's<00:02:43.560> pretty

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
way it came out man that's pretty

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:44.300 
way it came out man that's pretty
cool-looking

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
cool-looking

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.130 
cool-looking
so<00:02:44.610> I<00:02:44.880> try<00:02:45.270> to<00:02:45.300> make<00:02:45.390> sure<00:02:45.600> I<00:02:45.630> go<00:02:45.780> down<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.020> list

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
so I try to make sure I go down the list

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.270 
so I try to make sure I go down the list
here<00:02:46.350> because<00:02:46.500> sometimes<00:02:46.650> I<00:02:46.950> missed<00:02:47.130> some

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
here because sometimes I missed some

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.580 
here because sometimes I missed some
stuff<00:02:47.370> but<00:02:47.820> I<00:02:48.210> love<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:48.990> fact<00:02:49.230> that<00:02:49.320> it<00:02:49.470> has

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
stuff but I love the fact that it has

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.960 
stuff but I love the fact that it has
the<00:02:49.740> correct<00:02:49.890> wheels<00:02:50.310> I<00:02:50.370> mean<00:02:50.520> it's<00:02:50.790> the

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
the correct wheels I mean it's the

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.910 
the correct wheels I mean it's the
wheels<00:02:51.210> only<00:02:51.480> came<00:02:51.660> on<00:02:51.810> these<00:02:51.990> lifts<00:02:52.560> off<00:02:52.710> food

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
wheels only came on these lifts off food

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.460 
wheels only came on these lifts off food
cars<00:02:53.160> I<00:02:53.400> don't<00:02:53.640> know<00:02:53.820> if<00:02:53.910> you<00:02:54.000> know<00:02:54.120> this<00:02:54.240> but

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
cars I don't know if you know this but

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.270 
cars I don't know if you know this but
they<00:02:55.470> actually<00:02:55.590> stopped<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.130> production

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
they actually stopped the production

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.240 
they actually stopped the production
line<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:57.420> build<00:02:57.600> these<00:02:57.930> lifts<00:02:58.620> off<00:02:58.770> hood<00:02:58.980> cars

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
line to build these lifts off hood cars

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.520 
line to build these lifts off hood cars
and<00:02:59.489> I'll<00:02:59.670> show<00:02:59.820> you<00:02:59.880> like<00:03:00.170> unless<00:03:01.170> you<00:03:01.290> know

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
and I'll show you like unless you know

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.290 
and I'll show you like unless you know
why<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:01.770> they're<00:03:02.280> called<00:03:02.520> liftoff<00:03:02.850> hood<00:03:03.060> cars

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
why the they're called liftoff hood cars

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.729 
why the they're called liftoff hood cars
but<00:03:03.540> we're<00:03:03.870> gonna<00:03:03.989> actually<00:03:04.260> lift<00:03:04.440> off<00:03:04.590> the

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
but we're gonna actually lift off the

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.050 
but we're gonna actually lift off the
hood<00:03:04.920> here<00:03:05.160> and<00:03:05.310> show<00:03:05.730> you<00:03:05.790> because<00:03:05.880> most

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
hood here and show you because most

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.949 
hood here and show you because most
muscle<00:03:06.420> cars<00:03:06.630> have<00:03:07.100> have<00:03:08.100> a<00:03:08.820> hood<00:03:09.209> hinges<00:03:09.360> and

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
muscle cars have have a hood hinges and

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.300 
muscle cars have have a hood hinges and
this<00:03:10.110> car<00:03:10.350> does<00:03:10.470> not<00:03:10.500> so<00:03:10.800> pretty<00:03:10.950> cool<00:03:11.190> so

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
this car does not so pretty cool so
