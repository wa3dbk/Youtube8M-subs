00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.960
 to get it 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.180
 how about cristian 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.200

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.410

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.320
 bayern by who will be sitting on the 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.910
 rival bench and why he has tell 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.950
 for that game as you see why 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.119
 you are a clairvoyant of many 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.590
 pictures that maybe holiday them 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.950
 they are deleted 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:22.270
 more soldiers and then related to 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.380
 So how do you see this template 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.329
 this confrontation in what has been 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.070
 open between pep guardiola tito 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:29.240
 vilanova to the barça a bit strange for 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.700
 all the players all this 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.329
 Well, I think the staff is at 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.710
 margin of things that happen then no 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:37.920
 the things that have happened not the truth 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.960
 what 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.850
 and they each gave his opinion 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.100
 we do not enter to value these 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.170
 issues and the match against the bayern what 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.549
 we see as one more test of 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.770
 preseason the truth that it will be a 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.750
 more demanding but good game no 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.970
 we face it equally and to prepare 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.220
 for the year that is not expected to go to 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.880
 be very hard 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.880
 and move 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:07.330

 It has all bourbon bourbon camí and there are 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.069
 any 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.020

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.080
 well and here the same illusion is to succeed 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:39.040
 here and work to the fullest to have more 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.040
 opportunities here are 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:46.010

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.910
 the new illusion continue here and at 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.410
 representative that I was here again 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.410

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.790
 last season after the tie 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.709
 against the bayern probably your ante 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.079
 the absence of messi was the forward 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.540
 It coming in the best form 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:14.340
 games we have minutes if you understood the 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.290
 decision of the coach and if at that time 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.090
 it comes to you to consider looking for a 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.209
 departure this summer 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.480
 well all the decision of the mister are 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.459
 respectable not if I do not play a minute 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.190
 some reason would have the why not me 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.420
 I'm going to consider looking for no way out 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.480
 no exit for the summer not the 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.180
 true that my dream is to be here 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.160
 work to the maximum and fight for a 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.349
 put in the eleven holder not every year 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.930
 what happens I see myself with more experience and 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:45.420
 better worked and the competition I know 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.620
 which is very hard but I like the challenge and 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.620
 I hope to get it 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.590
 4 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.490
 I would like to know your opinion about the 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.490
 path that has taken day 2 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.659
 as opposed to situations that 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.159
 you want for here surely you've 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:06.530
 listened but you have had possibilities 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:08.120
 of listening to offers he has decided to leave 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.640
 what do you think and then you tell me 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.079
 a little bit those signings that the 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.450
 madrid models i understand well you know 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:16.220
 stamped with you the selection and if you 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.269
 It seems that the duel with the whites is going to 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.000
 be quite more defined than the year 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.489
 past 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.230
 good the theme of thiago or not so a 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:27.010
 your very respectable decision from here 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:29.140
 give you my congratulations and have all the 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.850
 luck of the world the truth that is a 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.500
 great player not the truth that the 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.480
 bayern has made a spectacular signing 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.910
 but hey maybe he thought that 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.140
 here I was not going to have the minutes that 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:41.500
 you need the decision you made and good 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:43.060
 wish you good luck the signings of the 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.480
 madrid the truth that I was lucky 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.820
 play with them this European this year 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.610
 and the truth is that the players are very 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.980
 good ones that will give a leap 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:57.840
 more quality in madrid because it was a 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.840
 hard-fought match like every year 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.530
 and lusty víctor from scratch 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.590
 and prepared to compete with neymar the 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.570
 star signing 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.340
 yes very prepared good both neymar as 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:13.060
 all that is my position not all 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:15.220
 are they are great are I think this 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.660
 team has the best in my position 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.630
 the best in the world and good the 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.160
 competition is going to be very hard but as 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.710
 I have said before to work to the fullest 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.740
 this year so that the coach sees that 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:29.990
 I'm on top of that I'm well into the 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:33.890
 team and wait for many opportunities 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:35.660
 my questions no thanks 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:38.680
 the antenna that is thirsty this afternoon 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.680
 they contribute each
