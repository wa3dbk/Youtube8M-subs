00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
hey um I already did a five beat video

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.820 
hey um I already did a five beat video
I'm<00:00:06.270> pretty<00:00:06.720> sure<00:00:06.930> something<00:00:07.410> else<00:00:07.560> saw<00:00:07.799> it

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
I'm pretty sure something else saw it

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.759 
I'm pretty sure something else saw it
but<00:00:08.130> I<00:00:08.250> didn't<00:00:08.550> like<00:00:08.700> it<00:00:08.880> so<00:00:09.740> here<00:00:10.740> goes

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
but I didn't like it so here goes

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.230 
but I didn't like it so here goes
another<00:00:11.250> behind<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:12.059> back<00:00:12.269> five<00:00:12.660> beat<00:00:13.019> we've

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:14.240 
another behind the back five beat we've

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.099 
another behind the back five beat we've
video<00:00:15.240> oh<00:00:17.090> I'm<00:00:18.090> probably<00:00:18.390> still<00:00:18.510> look<00:00:18.779> it<00:00:18.930> is

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
video oh I'm probably still look it is

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.560 
video oh I'm probably still look it is
very<00:00:19.470> good<00:00:22.130> ok<00:00:23.130> this<00:00:23.400> is<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.609> behind<00:00:24.060> back<00:00:24.330> by

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
very good ok this is the behind back by

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.130 
very good ok this is the behind back by
beat<00:00:24.840> we've<00:00:29.539> okay<00:00:30.539> i'm<00:00:30.599> getting<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.840> little<00:00:30.869> bit

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
beat we've okay i'm getting a little bit

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.010 
beat we've okay i'm getting a little bit
all<00:00:31.260> right<00:00:31.289> all<00:00:32.009> right<00:00:32.540> screwed<00:00:33.540> up<00:00:33.630> justin

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
all right all right screwed up justin

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.680 
all right all right screwed up justin
said<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.410> spoke<00:00:34.739> too<00:00:34.890> soon<00:00:35.239> ok<00:00:36.239> anyway

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.049 

explain<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.780> mechanics<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:40.410> this<00:00:41.059> hopefully

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
explain the mechanics of this hopefully

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.819 
explain the mechanics of this hopefully
better<00:00:42.420> than<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:42.780> did<00:00:42.840> before<00:00:43.110> it's<00:00:43.710> probably

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
better than I did before it's probably

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.060 
better than I did before it's probably
be<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.190> same<00:00:45.320> really<00:00:46.320> I'm<00:00:46.469> only<00:00:46.649> doing<00:00:47.039> this

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
be the same really I'm only doing this

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.130 
be the same really I'm only doing this
video<00:00:47.520> again<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:48.059> y'all<00:00:48.300> can<00:00:48.329> get<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.690> visual

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
video again so y'all can get the visual

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.860 
video again so y'all can get the visual
of<00:00:49.379> me<00:00:49.620> actually<00:00:49.800> doing<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.510> better<00:00:51.510> because<00:00:51.719> I

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
of me actually doing it better because I

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.430 
of me actually doing it better because I
know<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.110> first<00:00:52.350> ones<00:00:52.620> sorry<00:00:53.780> so<00:00:54.780> hopefully<00:00:55.199> I

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
know the first ones sorry so hopefully I

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.540 
know the first ones sorry so hopefully I
can<00:00:55.559> do<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.250> little<00:00:56.370> bit<00:00:56.460> better<00:00:56.670> now<00:00:56.910> and

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
can do it a little bit better now and

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.819 
can do it a little bit better now and
get<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.730> done<00:00:59.910> for<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.530> anyways<00:01:01.530> the

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
get that done for you anyways the

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.039 
get that done for you anyways the
mechanics<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.539> probably<00:01:03.539> easiest<00:01:03.840> thing

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
mechanics of probably easiest thing

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.310 
mechanics of probably easiest thing
explain<00:01:05.000> say<00:01:06.000> you're<00:01:06.150> doing<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.570> three<00:01:07.020> beat

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
explain say you're doing a three beat

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.109 
explain say you're doing a three beat
behind<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.430> back<00:01:08.640> we've<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.479> Reverse<00:01:11.060> by<00:01:12.060> the

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
behind the back we've in Reverse by the

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.940 
behind the back we've in Reverse by the
way<00:01:12.299> I'm<00:01:12.420> teaching<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.049> five<00:01:13.260> beat<00:01:13.530> we've<00:01:13.710> in

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
way I'm teaching the five beat we've in

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.320 
way I'm teaching the five beat we've in
reverse<00:01:14.340> because<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.640> don't<00:01:14.790> know<00:01:14.880> how<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.090> do

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
reverse because I don't know how to do

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:23.660 
reverse because I don't know how to do
it<00:01:16.939> forward<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.210> anyways<00:01:19.820> um<00:01:22.280> act<00:01:23.280> like<00:01:23.549> you're

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
it forward so anyways um act like you're

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.660 
it forward so anyways um act like you're
doing<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:24.119> reverse<00:01:24.420> behind<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.259> back

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
doing a reverse behind the back

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.429 
doing a reverse behind the back
wheat-free<00:01:26.670> beat<00:01:27.210> behind<00:01:27.450> bet<00:01:27.840> week<00:01:28.049> which<00:01:28.290> is

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
wheat-free beat behind bet week which is

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.569 
wheat-free beat behind bet week which is
this<00:01:28.860> motion<00:01:29.810> now<00:01:30.810> when<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:31.710> go<00:01:31.950> on<00:01:32.040> one<00:01:32.310> side

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
this motion now when you go on one side

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.910 
this motion now when you go on one side
of<00:01:32.610> your<00:01:32.729> body<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.390> know<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.500> put<00:01:34.740> with

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
of your body you know that put with

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.100 
of your body you know that put with
unwind<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.850> your<00:01:36.000> left<00:01:36.210> goes<00:01:36.420> over<00:01:36.750> if<00:01:36.960> you're

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
unwind and your left goes over if you're

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.120 
unwind and your left goes over if you're
doing<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.350> 3d<00:01:37.820> instead<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.090> happening

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
doing a 3d instead of that happening

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.969 
doing a 3d instead of that happening
you're<00:01:41.130> going<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.869> have<00:01:42.869> your<00:01:43.229> right<00:01:43.590> hand

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
you're going to have your right hand

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.710 
you're going to have your right hand
come<00:01:44.460> over<00:01:45.020> your<00:01:46.020> left<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.680> your<00:01:46.909> left<00:01:47.909> it's

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
come over your left and your left it's

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.969 
come over your left and your left it's
going<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.960> kind<00:01:49.079> of<00:01:49.200> want<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.470> try<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.710> stay

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
going to kind of want to try to stay

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.700 
going to kind of want to try to stay
behind<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:51.060> then<00:01:51.390> your<00:01:52.290> right<00:01:52.320> hand<00:01:52.619> is<00:01:52.680> going

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
behind and then your right hand is going

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.819 
behind and then your right hand is going
to<00:01:52.829> have<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.040> kind<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.310> push<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.270> forward<00:01:54.829> to

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
to have to kind of push it forward to

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.020 
to have to kind of push it forward to
I'm<00:01:56.130> going<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.340> push<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.759> other<00:01:56.969> side

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
I'm going to push it to the other side

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.550 
I'm going to push it to the other side
and<00:01:57.659> then<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:59.159> unwind<00:01:59.640> there<00:02:00.350> and<00:02:01.350> do<00:02:01.500> the

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
and then you unwind there and do the

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.180 
and then you unwind there and do the
same<00:02:01.829> thing<00:02:02.159> but<00:02:02.369> your<00:02:02.549> left<00:02:02.820> hand<00:02:03.149> comes<00:02:04.020> over

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
same thing but your left hand comes over

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.000 
same thing but your left hand comes over
the<00:02:05.580> top<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:05.940> your<00:02:06.000> right<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.630> then<00:02:06.930> do<00:02:07.890> it

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010 
the top of your right and then do it

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:12.410 
the top of your right and then do it
that<00:02:08.369> way<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:09.680> notice<00:02:10.680> how<00:02:10.890> I'm<00:02:11.880> really

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
that way and notice how I'm really

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.500 
that way and notice how I'm really
turning<00:02:12.630> my<00:02:12.930> body<00:02:13.610> whenever<00:02:14.610> you're<00:02:14.970> doing<00:02:15.180> it

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
turning my body whenever you're doing it

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.150 
turning my body whenever you're doing it
behind<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:16.080> back<00:02:16.230> five<00:02:16.500> be<00:02:18.980> turning<00:02:19.980> your

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
behind the back five be turning your

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.110 
behind the back five be turning your
body<00:02:20.400> is<00:02:20.760> really<00:02:21.330> key<00:02:21.690> because<00:02:22.730> it's<00:02:23.730> super

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
body is really key because it's super

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.410 
body is really key because it's super
hard<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.750> be<00:02:24.900> able<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.550> do<00:02:26.550> that<00:02:26.760> in<00:02:27.030> nocturne

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
hard to be able to do that in nocturne

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.730 
hard to be able to do that in nocturne
your<00:02:27.570> body<00:02:27.720> so<00:02:27.900> really<00:02:28.350> it's<00:02:28.440> almost<00:02:28.590> like

yeah<00:03:56.040> all<00:03:56.670> right<00:03:56.940> I<00:03:57.180> think<00:03:57.450> that<00:03:57.510> worked<00:03:57.750> out

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
yeah all right I think that worked out

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.160 
yeah all right I think that worked out
better<00:03:59.000> in<00:04:00.000> my<00:04:00.180> last<00:04:00.360> video<00:04:00.600> even<00:04:01.140> though

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
better in my last video even though

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.460 
better in my last video even though
they're<00:04:01.350> probably<00:04:01.760> pretty<00:04:02.760> much<00:04:02.910> identical

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
they're probably pretty much identical

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.250 
they're probably pretty much identical
but<00:04:04.470> uh<00:04:05.150> yeah<00:04:06.150> there<00:04:06.390> goes<00:04:06.420> your<00:04:06.720> 5<00:04:06.960> beat

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
but uh yeah there goes your 5 beat

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.920 
but uh yeah there goes your 5 beat
reverse<00:04:07.980> five<00:04:08.610> feet<00:04:08.880> behind<00:04:08.910> the<00:04:09.390> back<00:04:09.920> we've
