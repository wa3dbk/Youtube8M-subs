00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:08.960
 hello hello guys now let's play the 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:12.390
 theme of pulleys and gears first 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:15.660
 we will start with gears here we have 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:18.449
 the two wheels in grenades there you see that 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.300
 rotate in opposite directions if you are already 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.230
 turning clockwise will rotate in 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.869
 counter-clockwise in opposite directions 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:31.710
 now what is the relationship we have 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.110
 to keep in mind with the wheels 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.740
 If these two wheels had the same 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:41.300
 number of teeth 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:44.600
 to see now to see if the teeth that have 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.990
 would be equal to the number of teeth that 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.840
 has b then the relationship is fulfilled 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.910
 that the velocity of a is equal to 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.450
 speed of b 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:01:00.020
 however if the number of teeth that 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:04.190
 has a is different from the number of teeth 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:07.550
 that has b then the speed of a 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:10.490
 will be different will be different to the 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:14.980
 velocity of b but what is the relation 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:19.150
 What are we interested in doing? 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:22.270
 when the wheel the clay rolls when 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:25.300
 any wheel has a number of 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.980
 teeth will have a relationship with respect 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.950
 at the speed that this wheel has 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.890
 now if the number of teeth of this 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:37.570
 wheel increases the speed of this 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:42.150
 wheel decreases if the number of teeth 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:46.480
 of this wheel decreases the speed 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:51.150
 will increase to this type of relationship will be 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:55.830
 known as inverse relationship or 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.830
 proportionally inverse 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.140
 Inverse proportionality ratio 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:12.840
 to apologize in the time it takes me 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.750
 write ready proportion ratio 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.550
 reverse now a proportion ratio 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.790
 inverse in a ratio of proportion 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.500
 Inverse, the next thing that the 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.950
 number of teeth 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.250
 that has a wheel 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.840
 multiplied 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.340
 to the speed 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.340
 speed to see 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.580
 to the speed of this wheel 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:48.599
 will be equal to a constant these are 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.470
 in this inverse proportion is the one that 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:57.799
 interesting now we return to the wheels to 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:03:03.269
 and b of the proportion that we have we can 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:08.489
 finally affirm that the number of 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:10.379
 teeth that you have to by the speed that 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.230
 has by the speed of the speed of 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:16.459
 a module for the speed that it has to is 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:21.600
 equal to the number of teeth you have 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:24.840
 because of the speed it has 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.510
 guys this is quickly remember what 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.300
 speed is a physical quantity 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.950
 vector that involves direction and 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.620
 module what are we going to take in these 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:38.850
 fields is simply the module that is the 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:41.700
 quickly simply the number with which 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.800
 they will give us a reference generally 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.900
 in the speed 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:50.659
 of the expressed 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.659
 in revolutions per minute 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.600
 ready guys this is the relationship that 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.570
 we are interested 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:01.110
 very good guys now we continue with the 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:04.810
 gear video let's know 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:07.270
 apply better what theory we have a 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.570
 exercise in which a wheel tells us 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:15.220
 has 140 teeth while the wheel 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:17.620
 of 210 teeth the biggest wheel has 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.820
 a speed of 120 revolutions per 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.450
 minute 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:26.070
 what is the speed of the wheel very well 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:32.210
 here we have a chart ready 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:35.280
 the wheels tell us that the wheel has 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:41.160
 140 teeth then the teeth of a 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:44.030
 will be 140 and that the air wheel a 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:50.790
 little bit more up already and that the wheel b 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:53.100
 has 210 teeth does not tell us the wheel 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.350
 larger has a speed of 120 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.970
 revolutions per minute we're going to 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.040
 take that the biggest wheel is the 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.500
 wheel that has the largest number of teeth 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.350
 because the teeth in both cases have 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.360
 that in gr give each other then the 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.480
 wheel of higher number of teeth will be 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:13.550
 therefore bigger then the wheel sees 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:16.470
 will turn to 100 at a speed of 120 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:19.580
 revolutions by 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:21.550
 to see now if 120 revolutions per 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.010
 minute 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.950
 now it says what is the speed of the 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:30.820
 wheel and this is what the 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:33.940
 speed of the wheel remember the 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:37.690
 proportion who 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:40.260
 who told them how many teeth 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:45.100
 of a wheel 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:48.449
 by the speed of said wheel 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:52.229
 will be equal to the amount of teeth 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:56.849
 of the wheel with which they are going to turn 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:58.650
 the speed of said wheel we apply 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:04.189
 simple way the amount of teeth 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:07.710
 that has 210 how fast should 120 

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:12.990
 revolutions per minute number of 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:14.700
 teeth of a 140 and how fast is it 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:18.920
 who ask us to find 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:21.960
 of this very complicated operation 

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:27.230
 we came to the conclusion that rice 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:27.230
 will eventually speed 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.990
 180 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:36.180
 revolutions per minute 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:39.060
 remember the speed is expressed in 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:41.430
 revolutions per minute multiply 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.280
 divide very well guys this is the 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:46.800
 answer I hope that now yes that 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:49.979
 understood this topic and any 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:53.900
 comment send it to the page that he 

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:56.449
 live here the video like our 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.380
 informative twitter and facebook 

00:06:56.449 --> 00:07:02.589
 take care a lot bye bye
