00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.780
 white 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.940
 all this is what the health cgt us 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.789
 request to be able to operate a 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.770
 water business or water sale 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.960
 purified once these 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.719
 ideal conditions to install a 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.540
 We show you the seven processes 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.360
 of purification and bottling that 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.880

 company gives to each of its clients and 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.950
 you can see how simple it is 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.810
 is to operate this plant for another type of 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.610
 plants that immaculate water sell 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.070
 have the seven processes of 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.260
 purification health agent 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.000
 demands to have an excellent water 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.890
 purified the seven processes are 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.590
 sand filter carbon filter 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.020
 filters polishers filters softener 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.090
 reverse osmosis light lamp 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.800
 ultraviolet ozone sterilization 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.570
 are the seven processes that water 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.369
 Inmaculada has in each of its 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.470
 plants to be able to have the 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.360
 certification that your water is 100% 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.240
 purified we will know closely 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.750
 these seven processes of the base plant 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.490
 of water purification and bottling 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.520
 tower connector manager 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.170
 Immaculate water marketing the 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.300
 first filtering medium by which it will 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.149
 pass our drinking water to be able to 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.009
 be purified is the filter plus the 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.429
 old filter is going to remove all the 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.790
 Large garbage that may contain water 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.799
 Leaves branches earth is removed from the filter 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.760
 of sands 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:18.319
 later the following means 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.420
 filter with which we have in 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.549
 our purification plants is the 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.680
 carbon filter the carbon filter 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:26.810
 must remove all that is the color odor 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.209
 and taste to the water since the water has to 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.680
 be in color in smell in flavor to each one 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.170
 of these processes play a role 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.719
 primordial to obtain water from 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.459
 excellent quality something immaculate has 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:40.489
 designed its plants under the rules 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:43.459
 international stricter purity 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.989
 and health with own technology the 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.629
 next purification process to 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.939
 what we count is the smoothed filter in 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:51.349
 if it is necessary for the water to have 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:53.510
 certain level of hardness 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.579
 we are going to require this element 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.290
 which is the smoothing filter the room 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:00.290
 purification process by which it goes to 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.319
 pass the water are the polishing filters 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.939
 These polishing filters contain inside 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.250
 a multi-retention filter that goes to 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:09.409
 allow to retain all the particles 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.469
 suspended in the water since it is a 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:14.299
 5 micron filter and prevents these 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:15.910
 particles continue with the process of 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:18.910
 purification 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.290
 it is multi retention the water also the 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.000
 polishing filter will also give you the 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.890
 crystallinity to water this makes the 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.440
 water will be cleaner and will be more 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.300
 crystalline the process designed by water 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.820
 immaculate to purify the vital 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.160
 liquid allows it to be used in 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:36.130
 diverse conditions such as the urban network 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.230
 the pipes or a spring guaranteeing 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.600
 that the final product is the best 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.190
 quality continuing with our process 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.680
 of purification we have our system 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.110
 of reverse osmosis we wash reverse goes to 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.750
 retain all the minerals it contains 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.610
 the water this is only necessary 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.710
 when the water has access to salts 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.500
 minerals another purification process 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.060
 with which our plants count is 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.890
 the ultraviolet light lamp the 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.110
 Ultraviolet light lamp is a 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.240
 excellent germicide since it prevents 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.610
 go through there any bacteria is 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.800
 suspended in the water the last process 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:13.150
 of purification with which the water passes 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.860
 is the ozone system in the 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.090
 sterilization by ozone us to 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.070
 through an adventure valve 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.109
 we inject ozone into the water this is going to 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.639
 give the expiration of the water allowing 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.129
 that the water does not turn green 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.199
 and prolonging more the life of the water is 

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:28.689
 stored in a reform once 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:30.400
 have our water completely purified 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:32.889
 as required by the rules of the 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.870
 health secretariat we are ready to 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:36.520
 bottling all our plants 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.379
 purifiers apart from having the 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.779
 pumps and filters needed for 

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:43.779
 purification systems have two 

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:45.370
 tables one for washing garrafones and 

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:47.379
 one for filling reasons 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.840
 Sometimes they are made of steel 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:52.029
 stainless steel are manufactured 100% here in 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.919
 mexico and we provide this 

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:56.710
 team with each of our plants 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:59.469
 purifiers guarantee both the 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.960
 water quality its processes and success 

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:04.659
 commercial that represents immaculate water 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:08.229
