together<00:02:05.520> go<00:02:06.119> ahead<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.479> chop<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:07.289> will<00:02:07.440> end

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
together go ahead and chop you will end

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:10.070 
together go ahead and chop you will end
up<00:02:07.830> with<00:02:08.070> long<00:02:08.340> thin<00:02:08.700> strips<00:02:09.149> this<00:02:09.750> is<00:02:09.929> what

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
up with long thin strips this is what

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.500 
up with long thin strips this is what
you<00:02:10.229> call<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.440> shove<00:02:10.769> the<00:02:10.890> noid<00:02:11.070> cuts<00:02:11.430> some<00:02:12.390> of

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
you call a shove the noid cuts some of

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.360 
you call a shove the noid cuts some of
the<00:02:12.600> pieces<00:02:12.840> maybe<00:02:13.260> longer<00:02:13.890> than<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.250> other

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
the pieces maybe longer than the other

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.759 
the pieces maybe longer than the other
so<00:02:14.459> it's<00:02:14.910> okay<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.239> rough<00:02:15.510> chop<00:02:15.620> this<00:02:16.620> will

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
so it's okay to rough chop this will

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.560 
so it's okay to rough chop this will
release<00:02:17.100> a<00:02:17.130> lot<00:02:17.430> of<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:17.670> Basil's<00:02:18.180> oil<00:02:18.360> which
