00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
which ones I like the most but it seems

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.390

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:37.400 
that the ones that a little bit older

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.630 
that the ones that a little bit older
are<00:00:37.820> the<00:00:38.030> ones<00:00:38.210> that<00:00:38.300> I<00:00:38.390> seem<00:00:38.629> to<00:00:38.660> like<00:00:38.839> this

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.119 

I'm<00:00:43.640> not<00:00:44.600> quite<00:00:44.960> sure<00:00:44.989> how<00:00:45.290> to<00:00:45.350> make<00:00:45.559> kimchi<00:00:45.739> I

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
I'm not quite sure how to make kimchi I

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.369 
I'm not quite sure how to make kimchi I
know<00:00:46.489> that<00:00:46.820> there's<00:00:47.000> like<00:00:47.180> some<00:00:47.449> spicy<00:00:48.140> like

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
know that there's like some spicy like

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:50.680 
know that there's like some spicy like
red<00:00:48.769> peppers<00:00:49.190> and<00:00:49.489> I<00:00:49.699> think<00:00:49.940> vinegar<00:00:50.360> as<00:00:50.480> well

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
red peppers and I think vinegar as well

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.590 
red peppers and I think vinegar as well
but<00:00:51.589> as<00:00:51.860> to<00:00:52.129> the<00:00:52.250> other<00:00:52.280> exact<00:00:52.940> ingredients

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600
