okay so the strength goes up by one
point<00:01:31.060> two<00:01:31.350> intelligence<00:01:32.350> by<00:01:32.940> point<00:01:33.940> eight

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
point two intelligence by point eight

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.420 
point two intelligence by point eight
and<00:01:34.240> agility<00:01:35.080> by<00:01:35.260> one<00:01:35.530> point<00:01:35.710> five<00:01:36.070> so<00:01:36.400> let's

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
and agility by one point five so let's

756 plus 40 strength that's added on to
I<00:01:44.050> basically<00:01:44.350> 800<00:01:44.860> strength<00:01:45.160> and<00:01:45.430> elect<00:01:46.300> 600

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
I basically 800 strength and elect 600

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:53.060 
I basically 800 strength and elect 600
agility<00:01:47.610> 1040<00:01:48.610> maximum<00:01:49.060> HP<00:01:49.620> around<00:01:50.940> 1400
