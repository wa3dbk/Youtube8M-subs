one of the most frustrating things for

one of the most frustrating things for

frustrating disappointing if see
somebody<00:00:28.000> that<00:00:28.060> gets<00:00:28.570> an<00:00:28.779> Aquos<00:00:29.050> keep

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
somebody that gets an Aquos keep

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.260 
somebody that gets an Aquos keep
ecosystem<00:00:29.800> pond<00:00:30.040> and<00:00:30.279> then<00:00:30.759> doesn't<00:00:31.000> use

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:31.270 
ecosystem pond and then doesn't use

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:32.549 
ecosystem pond and then doesn't use
products<00:00:31.779> that<00:00:31.900> are<00:00:31.990> designed<00:00:32.110> for<00:00:32.470> that

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
products that are designed for that

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:34.619 
products that are designed for that
ecosystem<00:00:32.879> yeah<00:00:33.879> it's<00:00:34.030> frustrating<00:00:34.239> to

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:34.629 
ecosystem yeah it's frustrating to

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:36.690 
ecosystem yeah it's frustrating to
everyone<00:00:35.020> because<00:00:35.350> the<00:00:35.710> problem<00:00:36.070> is<00:00:36.250> when<00:00:36.670> we

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:36.700 
everyone because the problem is when we

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.490 
everyone because the problem is when we
design<00:00:37.090> the<00:00:37.239> products<00:00:37.600> we<00:00:37.690> design<00:00:38.290> them<00:00:38.410> at

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
design the products we design them at

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.040 
design the products we design them at
the<00:00:38.590> ecosystem<00:00:38.830> and<00:00:39.250> in<00:00:39.489> line<00:00:39.790> and<00:00:40.090> it's<00:00:40.780> all

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
the ecosystem and in line and it's all

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.450 
the ecosystem and in line and it's all
designed<00:00:41.230> to<00:00:41.680> reduce<00:00:41.860> the<00:00:42.010> amount<00:00:42.430> of

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
designed to reduce the amount of

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.920 
designed to reduce the amount of
maintenance<00:00:42.640> and<00:00:43.000> work<00:00:43.150> they<00:00:43.300> have<00:00:43.449> to<00:00:43.600> put<00:00:43.809> in

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
maintenance and work they have to put in

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.509 
maintenance and work they have to put in
and<00:00:44.170> I<00:00:44.290> mean<00:00:44.500> we<00:00:44.620> try<00:00:44.860> to<00:00:44.920> make<00:00:45.100> it<00:00:45.190> easier<00:00:45.430> with

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:45.519 
and I mean we try to make it easier with

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:47.729 
and I mean we try to make it easier with
a<00:00:45.550> pump<00:00:45.790> tops<00:00:46.030> go<00:00:46.540> out<00:00:46.660> every<00:00:47.110> couple<00:00:47.350> days<00:00:47.440> and

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
a pump tops go out every couple days and

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:49.740 
a pump tops go out every couple days and
pump<00:00:48.040> pump<00:00:48.220> pump<00:00:48.400> it's<00:00:48.640> it's<00:00:48.910> pretty<00:00:49.210> easy<00:00:49.360> but

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
pump pump pump it's it's pretty easy but

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.680 
pump pump pump it's it's pretty easy but
if<00:00:50.260> you<00:00:50.320> put<00:00:50.739> a<00:00:50.980> few<00:00:51.580> minutes<00:00:51.879> in<00:00:52.030> every<00:00:52.480> day

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
if you put a few minutes in every day

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.350 
if you put a few minutes in every day
into<00:00:53.469> some<00:00:53.710> simple<00:00:54.370> maintenance<00:00:54.550> just<00:00:54.910> in<00:00:55.149> the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
into some simple maintenance just in the

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.389 
into some simple maintenance just in the
long<00:00:55.570> run<00:00:55.780> it<00:00:55.930> saves<00:00:55.960> you<00:00:56.289> you<00:00:56.739> know<00:00:56.860> hours<00:00:57.250> of

long run it saves you you know hours of

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:59.700 
long run it saves you you know hours of
shirts<00:00:57.670> and<00:00:57.940> hassle<00:00:58.660> and<00:00:58.870> and<00:00:59.020> you<00:00:59.440> get<00:00:59.590> to

why<00:01:02.890> is<00:01:02.949> my<00:01:03.430> engine<00:01:03.789> an<00:01:04.030> important<00:01:04.600> part<00:01:04.839> of

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
why is my engine an important part of

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.170 
why is my engine an important part of
creating<00:01:05.920> your<00:01:06.460> system<00:01:06.729> and<00:01:06.850> keeping<00:01:07.149> a

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
creating your system and keeping a

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.450 
creating your system and keeping a
healthy<00:01:07.270> ecosystem<00:01:07.960> it<00:01:08.500> helps<00:01:08.860> balance<00:01:09.100> the

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
healthy ecosystem it helps balance the

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.180 
healthy ecosystem it helps balance the
system<00:01:09.640> out<00:01:09.910> it<00:01:10.180> lends<00:01:10.960> itself<00:01:11.259> to<00:01:11.410> the<00:01:12.009> water

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
system out it lends itself to the water

treatments<00:01:12.670> that<00:01:13.180> we<00:01:13.240> actually<00:01:13.390> use<00:01:13.720> and<00:01:14.050> you

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
treatments that we actually use and you

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.540 
treatments that we actually use and you
know<00:01:14.440> the<00:01:14.560> I<00:01:14.619> engine<00:01:14.920> is<00:01:15.009> an<00:01:15.130> electronic

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
know the I engine is an electronic

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.730 
know the I engine is an electronic
device<00:01:15.670> you<00:01:16.090> have<00:01:16.450> to<00:01:16.600> monitor<00:01:17.170> maintain<00:01:17.590> it

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
device you have to monitor maintain it

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.950 
device you have to monitor maintain it
but<00:01:17.950> if<00:01:18.070> you<00:01:18.160> do<00:01:18.310> that<00:01:18.460> on<00:01:18.729> a<00:01:19.210> weekly<00:01:19.390> basis<00:01:19.929> and

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
but if you do that on a weekly basis and

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.810 
but if you do that on a weekly basis and
just<00:01:20.229> watch<00:01:20.410> your<00:01:20.619> levels<00:01:20.860> on<00:01:21.100> it<00:01:21.250> it's<00:01:21.640> fine

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
just watch your levels on it it's fine

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.480 
just watch your levels on it it's fine
and<00:01:22.030> it's<00:01:22.090> it's<00:01:22.720> safe<00:01:23.110> because<00:01:23.320> of<00:01:23.679> how<00:01:24.369> it

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
and it's it's safe because of how it

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.969 
and it's it's safe because of how it
trickles<00:01:25.000> in<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:25.720> the<00:01:25.930> ions<00:01:26.229> into<00:01:26.710> the<00:01:26.799> water

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
trickles in the the ions into the water

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:29.160 
trickles in the the ions into the water
obviously<00:01:27.850> anything<00:01:28.060> misused<00:01:28.630> is<00:01:28.840> not<00:01:28.990> going

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
obviously anything misused is not going

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.710 
obviously anything misused is not going
to<00:01:29.229> be<00:01:29.400> good<00:01:30.400> but<00:01:30.820> if<00:01:30.939> you<00:01:30.970> use<00:01:31.150> the<00:01:31.299> iodine

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
to be good but if you use the iodine

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.330 
to be good but if you use the iodine
properly<00:01:32.200> it's<00:01:32.409> absolutely<00:01:33.100> a<00:01:33.130> fantastic

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
properly it's absolutely a fantastic

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.160 
properly it's absolutely a fantastic
part<00:01:33.939> of<00:01:34.000> supporting<00:01:34.270> an<00:01:34.479> ecosystem<00:01:34.780> yeah

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
part of supporting an ecosystem yeah

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.240 
part of supporting an ecosystem yeah
absolutely

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
absolutely

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.370 
absolutely
in<00:01:36.310> my<00:01:36.460> ecosystem<00:01:36.939> actually<00:01:37.240> is<00:01:37.360> is<00:01:37.630> is

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
in my ecosystem actually is is is

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.510 
in my ecosystem actually is is is
balance<00:01:38.770> not<00:01:38.890> even<00:01:39.040> better<00:01:39.189> and<00:01:39.310> you<00:01:39.369> might

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
balance not even better and you might

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.580 
balance not even better and you might
plant<00:01:39.880> growth<00:01:40.150> in<00:01:40.360> my<00:01:40.479> pond<00:01:40.780> right<00:01:40.900> now<00:01:41.140> in<00:01:41.409> the

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
plant growth in my pond right now in the

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.140 
plant growth in my pond right now in the
streams<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:42.040> waterfalls<00:01:42.579> and<00:01:42.759> marginal

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
streams the waterfalls and marginal

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.480 
streams the waterfalls and marginal
plants<00:01:43.420> are<00:01:43.600> huge<00:01:44.020> and<00:01:44.290> that's<00:01:44.500> because<00:01:44.890> what

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
plants are huge and that's because what

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:46.920 
plants are huge and that's because what
the<00:01:45.610> I<00:01:45.640> engine<00:01:45.939> does<00:01:46.119> is<00:01:46.329> help<00:01:46.570> balance<00:01:46.900> that

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
the I engine does is help balance that

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.289 
the I engine does is help balance that
out<00:01:47.140> helps<00:01:47.799> get<00:01:47.950> rid<00:01:47.979> of<00:01:48.130> the<00:01:48.280> leading<00:01:48.850> factor

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
out helps get rid of the leading factor

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:51.330 
out helps get rid of the leading factor
and<00:01:49.540> allows<00:01:49.780> the<00:01:50.110> nutrients<00:01:50.590> that<00:01:50.829> we're

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
and allows the nutrients that we're

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.010 
and allows the nutrients that we're
going<00:01:51.430> elsewhere<00:01:51.640> now<00:01:51.970> to<00:01:52.030> be<00:01:52.240> used<00:01:52.420> up<00:01:52.630> by

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
going elsewhere now to be used up by

quite a question is healthy it's out

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.399 
quite a question is healthy it's out
there<00:01:55.240> partly<00:01:55.630> it's<00:01:55.720> a<00:01:55.780> fertilizer<00:01:56.170> for<00:01:56.320> your

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
there partly it's a fertilizer for your

plants all right absolutely yeah it
actually<00:01:58.570> helps<00:01:58.869> the<00:01:58.990> ecosystem<00:01:59.439> and<00:01:59.560> doesn't

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
actually helps the ecosystem and doesn't

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:01.020 
actually helps the ecosystem and doesn't
hurt<00:01:59.890> people<00:02:00.189> yeah<00:02:00.310> absolutely

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:08.819 
not fish food
Calabar<00:02:06.640> we<00:02:07.000> can<00:02:07.149> I<00:02:07.869> mean<00:02:08.170> if<00:02:08.290> you<00:02:08.410> buy<00:02:08.619> an

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:08.829 
Calabar we can I mean if you buy an

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:09.719 
Calabar we can I mean if you buy an
inexpensive

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
inexpensive

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.030 
inexpensive
fish<00:02:10.060> food<00:02:10.360> you<00:02:10.989> don't<00:02:11.200> get<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:11.410> same<00:02:11.560> results

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
fish food you don't get the same results

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.060 
fish food you don't get the same results
I<00:02:12.220> mean<00:02:12.549> the<00:02:12.790> fish<00:02:12.970> don't<00:02:13.180> grow<00:02:13.890> at<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:15.040> same

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
I mean the fish don't grow at the same

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.000 
I mean the fish don't grow at the same
rate<00:02:15.280> they<00:02:15.700> don't<00:02:15.910> grow<00:02:16.180> as<00:02:16.450> healthy<00:02:17.350> if<00:02:17.530> you

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
rate they don't grow as healthy if you

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.710 
rate they don't grow as healthy if you
just<00:02:18.250> feed<00:02:18.489> a<00:02:18.519> regular<00:02:19.000> fish<00:02:19.239> food<00:02:19.510> or

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
just feed a regular fish food or

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.750 
just feed a regular fish food or
something<00:02:20.260> that's<00:02:20.380> inexpensive<00:02:20.760> oftentimes

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
something that's inexpensive oftentimes

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.240 
something that's inexpensive oftentimes
the<00:02:22.720> fish<00:02:22.870> get<00:02:23.049> sick<00:02:23.290> and<00:02:23.560> then<00:02:24.130> we're

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
the fish get sick and then we're

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.310 
the fish get sick and then we're
medicating<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:25.329> fish<00:02:25.570> and<00:02:25.810> then<00:02:25.959> it's<00:02:26.230> a

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
medicating the fish and then it's a

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.199 
medicating the fish and then it's a
problem<00:02:26.620> with<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:26.829> ecosystem<00:02:27.100> also<00:02:28.060> the

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
problem with the ecosystem also the

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:29.680 
problem with the ecosystem also the
amount<00:02:28.510> of<00:02:28.600> waste<00:02:28.900> that<00:02:29.139> the<00:02:29.260> fish

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
amount of waste that the fish

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.380 
amount of waste that the fish
is<00:02:30.110> huge<00:02:30.740> it<00:02:30.950> absolutely<00:02:31.340> impacts<00:02:32.270> the

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
is huge it absolutely impacts the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.750 
is huge it absolutely impacts the
ecosystem<00:02:33.020> so<00:02:33.560> when<00:02:33.740> developing<00:02:34.220> our<00:02:34.370> food<00:02:34.580> I

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
ecosystem so when developing our food I

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.430 
ecosystem so when developing our food I
mean<00:02:34.910> we<00:02:35.150> spent<00:02:35.390> a<00:02:35.480> lot<00:02:35.690> of<00:02:35.720> time<00:02:36.020> and<00:02:36.200> effort

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
mean we spent a lot of time and effort

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.290 
mean we spent a lot of time and effort
to<00:02:36.590> develop<00:02:36.980> a<00:02:37.070> product<00:02:37.340> that<00:02:37.490> was<00:02:37.760> you<00:02:38.210> know

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
to develop a product that was you know

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.600 
to develop a product that was you know
perfect<00:02:38.600> to<00:02:39.470> support<00:02:39.860> the<00:02:39.950> ecosystem<00:02:40.490> what

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
perfect to support the ecosystem what

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.430 
perfect to support the ecosystem what
we're<00:02:40.730> trying<00:02:40.940> to<00:02:41.060> do<00:02:41.150> as<00:02:41.270> a<00:02:41.300> company<00:02:41.540> how<00:02:42.290> does

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
we're trying to do as a company how does

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.960 
we're trying to do as a company how does
a<00:02:42.470> consumer<00:02:42.980> know<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:43.370> difference<00:02:43.700> in<00:02:43.790> fish

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
a consumer know the difference in fish

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.610 
a consumer know the difference in fish
food<00:02:44.180> I<00:02:44.270> mean<00:02:44.390> I<00:02:44.450> heard<00:02:44.690> a<00:02:44.810> lot<00:02:44.930> about<00:02:44.990> protein

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
food I mean I heard a lot about protein

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.200 
food I mean I heard a lot about protein
levels<00:02:45.950> and<00:02:46.100> opens<00:02:46.370> a<00:02:46.430> higher<00:02:46.580> protein<00:02:46.850> level

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
levels and opens a higher protein level

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:48.880 
levels and opens a higher protein level
it's<00:02:47.450> a<00:02:47.480> good<00:02:47.660> thing<00:02:47.870> how<00:02:48.320> is<00:02:48.380> it<00:02:48.590> what<00:02:48.830> a

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
it's a good thing how is it what a

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.410 
it's a good thing how is it what a
consumer<00:02:49.250> actually<00:02:49.730> be<00:02:49.850> able<00:02:49.910> to<00:02:50.090> tell<00:02:50.300> the

consumer actually be able to tell the

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.120 
consumer actually be able to tell the
difference<00:02:50.450> between<00:02:50.810> a<00:02:51.200> good<00:02:51.620> fish<00:02:51.800> food<00:02:52.010> a

difference between a good fish food a

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.190 
difference between a good fish food a
not-so-good<00:02:52.760> fish<00:02:52.940> food<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:53.570> best<00:02:53.780> way<00:02:53.990> is

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
not-so-good fish food the best way is

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.190 
not-so-good fish food the best way is
just<00:02:54.230> to<00:02:54.470> try<00:02:54.740> it<00:02:54.770> and<00:02:55.190> it's<00:02:56.080> unbelievable<00:02:57.080> how

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
just to try it and it's unbelievable how

problem the proof is in the pudding as

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.210 
problem the proof is in the pudding as
they<00:03:13.070> say<00:03:13.220> try<00:03:14.150> the<00:03:14.210> food<00:03:14.540> and<00:03:14.840> and<00:03:15.740> you'll<00:03:16.040> see

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
they say try the food and and you'll see

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.070 
they say try the food and and you'll see
that<00:03:16.370> you'll<00:03:16.640> see<00:03:16.820> the<00:03:16.940> difference<00:03:17.240> and<00:03:17.900> it's

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
that you'll see the difference and it's

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.050 
that you'll see the difference and it's
important<00:03:18.500> that<00:03:18.530> that<00:03:19.130> we<00:03:19.460> reduce<00:03:19.850> our

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
important that that we reduce our

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.240 
important that that we reduce our
footprint<00:03:20.390> and<00:03:20.780> yeah<00:03:21.620> and<00:03:21.800> that's<00:03:21.980> something

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
footprint and yeah and that's something

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.410 
footprint and yeah and that's something
that's<00:03:22.430> important<00:03:22.820> to<00:03:22.880> us<00:03:23.000> as<00:03:23.150> a<00:03:23.180> company

that's important to us as a company
obviously<00:03:23.990> you<00:03:24.350> know<00:03:24.500> that<00:03:24.740> and<00:03:25.610> whenever

we're developing a new product we make
sure<00:03:28.130> you<00:03:28.790> know<00:03:28.880> what's<00:03:29.030> our<00:03:29.120> philosophy<00:03:29.780> it's

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:29.990 
sure you know what's our philosophy it's

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.540 
sure you know what's our philosophy it's
the<00:03:30.080> same<00:03:30.290> reason<00:03:30.620> why<00:03:30.710> why<00:03:31.100> we<00:03:31.220> don't<00:03:31.310> have<00:03:31.460> an

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
the same reason why why we don't have an

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:32.110 
the same reason why why we don't have an
algaecide

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
algaecide

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.780 
algaecide
you<00:03:32.870> know<00:03:32.990> yeah<00:03:33.380> it<00:03:33.980> works<00:03:34.220> but<00:03:34.430> it<00:03:34.550> doesn't

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
you know yeah it works but it doesn't

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:35.770 
you know yeah it works but it doesn't
work<00:03:34.880> in<00:03:35.000> a<00:03:35.060> way<00:03:35.180> that<00:03:35.360> works<00:03:35.510> with<00:03:35.660> an

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
work in a way that works with an

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.900 
work in a way that works with an
ecosystem<00:03:36.140> it's<00:03:36.739> it's<00:03:37.070> a<00:03:37.160> shot<00:03:37.400> treat<00:03:37.670> and

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
ecosystem it's it's a shot treat and

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.520 
ecosystem it's it's a shot treat and
that's<00:03:38.510> not<00:03:38.720> something<00:03:38.989> that<00:03:39.080> we<00:03:39.200> want<00:03:39.320> to<00:03:39.410> do

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
that's not something that we want to do

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.199 
that's not something that we want to do
we<00:03:39.680> want<00:03:39.709> to<00:03:39.950> create<00:03:40.190> a<00:03:40.310> well<00:03:40.550> balanced<00:03:40.910> pond

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
we want to create a well balanced pond

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.290 
we want to create a well balanced pond
and<00:03:41.480> how<00:03:41.959> can<00:03:42.020> we<00:03:42.410> come<00:03:43.100> with<00:03:43.250> a<00:03:43.310> traditional

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
and how can we come with a traditional

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.720 
and how can we come with a traditional
algaecide<00:03:44.840> that<00:03:45.110> you<00:03:45.560> know<00:03:45.680> destroys<00:03:46.520> the

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
algaecide that you know destroys the

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.729 
algaecide that you know destroys the
ecosystem<00:03:47.390> we<00:03:47.630> just<00:03:47.810> you<00:03:48.020> just<00:03:48.200> won't<00:03:48.320> do<00:03:48.500> it

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
ecosystem we just you just won't do it

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.770 
ecosystem we just you just won't do it
it's<00:03:49.100> this<00:03:49.190> longer<00:03:49.489> term<00:03:49.640> it's<00:03:50.180> gonna<00:03:50.360> be<00:03:50.570> much

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
it's this longer term it's gonna be much

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.420 
it's this longer term it's gonna be much
more<00:03:50.959> healthy<00:03:51.320> for<00:03:51.500> the<00:03:51.590> environment<00:03:51.709> to<00:03:52.220> use

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
more healthy for the environment to use

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.520 
more healthy for the environment to use
water<00:03:53.150> treatments<00:03:53.720> and<00:03:53.870> an<00:03:53.959> approach<00:03:54.290> with

water treatments and an approach with

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:55.900 
water treatments and an approach with
that<00:03:54.709> work<00:03:54.950> of<00:03:55.100> an<00:03:55.190> ecosystem<00:03:55.370> instead<00:03:55.760> of

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
that work of an ecosystem instead of

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:56.470 
that work of an ecosystem instead of
against<00:03:56.239> it

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
against it

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.509 
against it
it<00:03:56.720> might<00:03:56.930> not<00:03:57.110> be<00:03:57.290> as<00:03:57.380> quick<00:03:57.620> acting<00:03:58.010> but<00:03:58.400> it's

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
it might not be as quick acting but it's

00:03:58.519 --> 00:03:59.560 
it might not be as quick acting but it's
certainly<00:03:58.760> going<00:03:58.850> to<00:03:58.970> give<00:03:59.120> you<00:03:59.180> the<00:03:59.300> most

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
certainly going to give you the most
