00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.620 
jeremy define grinding in the gym but
what<00:00:24.689> does<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:24.810> mean<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:26.119> guess<00:00:27.119> when<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.420> see

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
what does it mean I guess when you see

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.070 
what does it mean I guess when you see
people<00:00:27.990> lift<00:00:28.199> away<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:29.130> bar<00:00:29.310> stops

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
people lift away and the bar stops

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.020 
people lift away and the bar stops
seesaw<00:00:31.470> back<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.890> forth<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.400> then<00:00:32.580> sometimes

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
seesaw back and forth and then sometimes

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.860 
seesaw back and forth and then sometimes
it<00:00:33.120> gets<00:00:33.240> going<00:00:33.450> again

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
it gets going again

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.560 
it gets going again
yeah<00:00:34.850> although<00:00:35.850> most<00:00:36.060> of<00:00:36.120> time<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.390> does<00:00:36.540> not

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
yeah although most of time it does not

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.120 
yeah although most of time it does not
yeah<00:00:37.080> and<00:00:37.260> then<00:00:37.470> they<00:00:37.560> go<00:00:37.680> again

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.130 
yeah and then they go again

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.620 
yeah and then they go again
yeah<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.460> then<00:00:38.580> they<00:00:38.640> go<00:00:38.760> again<00:00:39.000> right<00:00:39.390> and

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:39.630 
yeah and then they go again right and

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.200 
yeah and then they go again right and
that's<00:00:40.110> actually<00:00:40.680> you're<00:00:41.640> greasing<00:00:42.150> a

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
that's actually you're greasing a

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.830 
that's actually you're greasing a
sub-optimal<00:00:43.550> okay<00:00:44.550> yeah<00:00:45.390> we'll<00:00:45.510> talk<00:00:45.720> about

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
sub-optimal okay yeah we'll talk about

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.810 
sub-optimal okay yeah we'll talk about
that<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.050> second<00:00:46.380> so<00:00:46.470> grinding<00:00:47.250> once<00:00:47.430> again<00:00:47.670> is

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
that a second so grinding once again is

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.920 
that a second so grinding once again is
kind<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.059> when<00:00:48.180> you're<00:00:48.300> struggling<00:00:48.629> with<00:00:48.870> the

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
kind of when you're struggling with the

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.780 
kind of when you're struggling with the
rep<00:00:49.050> you're<00:00:49.200> not<00:00:49.290> really<00:00:49.500> in<00:00:49.620> control<00:00:49.650> the<00:00:50.610> rep

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790 
rep you're not really in control the rep

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.910 
rep you're not really in control the rep
speed<00:00:50.970> is<00:00:51.330> slowing<00:00:51.690> down<00:00:51.780> significantly

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
speed is slowing down significantly

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.890 
speed is slowing down significantly
yeah<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.000> technically<00:00:54.420> how<00:00:54.540> it<00:00:54.600> looks<00:00:54.780> it

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900 
yeah and technically how it looks it

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.850 
yeah and technically how it looks it
also<00:00:55.020> doesn't<00:00:55.290> look<00:00:55.470> good

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
also doesn't look good

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.040 
also doesn't look good
no<00:00:56.280> it's<00:00:56.610> it's<00:00:57.000> wrong<00:00:57.239> you're<00:00:57.510> greasing<00:00:58.020> the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
no it's it's wrong you're greasing the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.780 
no it's it's wrong you're greasing the
wrong<00:00:58.350> groove<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.920> are<00:00:59.040> teaching<00:00:59.280> yourself

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
wrong groove you are teaching yourself

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.570 
wrong groove you are teaching yourself
to<00:01:00.300> actually<00:01:00.780> have<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:00.989> stop<00:01:01.350> in<00:01:01.620> your<00:01:01.770> route<00:01:02.010> so

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:02.580 
to actually have a stop in your route so

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.460 
to actually have a stop in your route so
the<00:01:02.790> more<00:01:02.970> you<00:01:03.089> do<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.269> the<00:01:03.449> more<00:01:03.870> times<00:01:04.260> your

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
the more you do that the more times your

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.080 
the more you do that the more times your
brain<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.980> going<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.190> code<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.640> lift<00:01:05.850> that's

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
brain is going to code the lift that's

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.880 
brain is going to code the lift that's
not<00:01:06.570> if<00:01:06.690> the<00:01:06.810> task<00:01:07.020> you're<00:01:07.200> doing<00:01:07.440> you<00:01:07.800> were

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
not if the task you're doing you were

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.800 
not if the task you're doing you were
making<00:01:08.190> the<00:01:08.280> bar<00:01:08.490> stop<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.210> then<00:01:09.479> trying<00:01:09.750> to

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
making the bar stop and then trying to

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.480 
making the bar stop and then trying to
get<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.050> going<00:01:10.290> again<00:01:10.350> now<00:01:11.159> why<00:01:11.310> do<00:01:11.370> you<00:01:11.430> think

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
get it going again now why do you think

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.280 
get it going again now why do you think
people<00:01:11.610> do<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:11.970> just<00:01:12.180> simply<00:01:12.270> ego<00:01:12.780> or<00:01:12.990> what

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
people do that just simply ego or what

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.990 
people do that just simply ego or what
is<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.500> Jeremy<00:01:13.710> yeah<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.220> think<00:01:14.430> he<00:01:14.550> goes<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.820> huge

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
is it Jeremy yeah I think he goes a huge

is it Jeremy yeah I think he goes a huge
part<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.659> think<00:01:15.810> they<00:01:16.500> see<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.740> lot<00:01:16.950> of

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
part of it I think they see a lot of

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.440 
part of it I think they see a lot of
people<00:01:17.190> on<00:01:17.400> YouTube<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.909> they<00:01:17.970> hit<00:01:18.150> their<00:01:18.300> big

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
people on YouTube and they hit their big

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.450 
people on YouTube and they hit their big
lifts<00:01:18.810> or<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.740> know<00:01:19.830> they<00:01:20.010> see<00:01:20.070> them<00:01:20.280> in<00:01:20.370> up

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
lifts or you know they see them in up

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.980 
lifts or you know they see them in up
enemy<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.060> they're<00:01:21.150> crying<00:01:21.360> out<00:01:21.570> or<00:01:21.720> left<00:01:21.900> or

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990

enemy and they're crying out or left or
whatever<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:22.440> they<00:01:22.560> think<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:22.799> they<00:01:22.950> have<00:01:23.040> to

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
whatever so they think that they have to

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.590 
whatever so they think that they have to
do<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.370> all<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.610> time<00:01:23.760> right<00:01:24.240> but<00:01:24.450> actually

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
do that all the time right but actually

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.730 
do that all the time right but actually
that<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.170> wrong

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
that is wrong
