00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.990
 how to farm in the game clash of 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.090
 clans 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.980
 what army how to do it as much as possible 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:31.619
 I'll just show you some of my own 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:35.730
 video let's start the first video this 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:39.149
 the most elementary the simplest that you 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.660
 can do with any with any level 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.590
 the game as a beginner and the professional 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.430
 eat as you see 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:51.970
 resources lie in the collectors so wolves 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:55.000
 storing there is absolutely nothing bushes 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.650
 you just let out your best 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.420
 barbarians goblins 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:04.510
 you want a dollar to 8 there is a hollow game in 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:09.210
 the armies were going to be me no longer like that 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.210
 the army learned such played it is time for us 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:17.400
 as you have already noticed, I have already taken everything 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:23.770
 resources and now I just finish off 50 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:27.820
 percent to lose and take away 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:31.119
 a little bit this thing is absolutely yours that is 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:34.720
 if you play the cup you want to stay 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:37.090
 in a certain league you can do 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.070
 also note i haven't spent 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.030
 all their soldiers 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:47.440
 here they are still left with me do not look 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.810
 what do i have bows that level and barbarians this 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:54.030
 can do absolutely on any level 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:57.130
 This is a very effective farm strategy and 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.220
 the following video both at the same time and 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.910
 farm and play a cup relatively 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.030
 inexpensive 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:11.860
 army is army 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:16.330
 gigs bombers that is this base i size 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.460
 100 percent here pay attention to 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:23.580
 I did not notice my mistake 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.580
 this is king and 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.710
 killed him only the middle was going to be 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.590
 when you play will 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.670
 with chicks first thing you need 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:47.720
 put here 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.180
 antiquity first of all boobs at least 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.980
 her 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.980
 then lips and here 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.480
 so we can look at 4 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.850
 things are going crash body 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.319
 going in Skolkovo 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.410
 such an army 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:23.050
 average 22 minutes are made 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:25.930
 that's like the army of bows but the difference from 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:30.390
 army is that it costs about 100 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:36.340
 thousand elixir army bows cost about 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:41.410
 6000 is our sixth level and one more 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:47.430
 video there at the end a vivid example of farm 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:51.070
 black elixir as you see it very 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.710
 rich rival next what's not my 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.100
 it was the army and lied then I would take 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:04:03.090
 everything 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:05.620
 I had everything as you can see myself at the beginning I 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:09.010
 tried to deal with the characters 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:14.190
 but unsuccessful I didnâ€™t pay attention exactly 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:16.750
 don't call gone here and here too 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:20.670
 resources in the main reservoirs 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:24.270
 part but also the repository they are also available 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.270
 that's because of this 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.760
 then cleaning 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.750
 and my goal was 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:40.409
 here it is dre 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:47.099
 because I knew that in 1200 letters and 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:49.939
 as you can see to the full legal therefore 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:49.939
 if bows 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:55.600
 they 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:59.320
 on top of 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:07.800
 you see a pretty solid fat 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:11.479
 turned out this fight for today is all 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.479
