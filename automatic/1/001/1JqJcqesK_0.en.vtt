00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:07.430
 we started here in a video 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:10.110
 in a kind of how to make a 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.180
 we will need four blocks of two 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.430
 blocks of snow and a house to catch 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.809
 to make a nyon block we are four 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.230
 of snow that we can find it in 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.220
 train 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:24.170
 snow directors we just take the shovel 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.170
 and we remove with 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.290
 if we remove it by hand 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.180
 so 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.990
 since once we have block of 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.240
 snow what we get 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.790
 the snow blocks 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.510
 but here 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.510
 It's a pumpkin 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.220
 and here we will have a 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.630
 this snow but they have died because 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.920
 it's raining I think 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.130
 it may be that we have the time that is 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.130
 raining 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.420
 to see if that's why 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.840
 it is seen that it does not survive 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.909
 of rain 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.640
 if he survives with shadow 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.270
 and if it's because of the rain that does not resist 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.270
 line 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.330
