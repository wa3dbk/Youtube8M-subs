00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.799
 a new gameplay from the lego batman game 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.929
 2 I am with a vehicle unlocking 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.490
 of lego the boy is for this unlocking 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.889
 we have to go to the station 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.100
 central metro and what are we going to 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.640
 unblock is to the press helicopter 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.199
 we doubled in this street and we have 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.539
 to climb to the top of this 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.960
 building that has the giant pipe 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.390
 is 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:33.350
 and well, being here 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:35.420
 there we have the press helicopter there 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:39.489
 down we have the light of the terminal 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.489
 remote to locate it better 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.250
 ok guys here we have our 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.700
 press helicopter and we can 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.960
 buy it for 150 thousand lego coins 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.520
 Boys 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.210
 more guys here we have our 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.489
 helicopter and let's ride on it 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.890
 let's follow the monedita circuit 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:05.089
 of course and in the end they are going to 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:06.829
 bring up the block of achieved vale 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.090
 then helicopter in the ego for they are 

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:13.500
 a difficult bit of 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.500
 to drive but 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:20.010
 but well you are going to avoid 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.270
 drive you're 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.820

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:29.060
 ok we're still here 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.250
 We spend a lot 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:37.400
 I think I give it too much speed 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.400
 and I know of that mistake on the road 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.170

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.280

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.710
 our golden lego block number 213 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.200
