the<00:00:34.050> poker<00:00:34.260> world<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.829> but<00:00:35.489> basically<00:00:35.820> what

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
the poker world and but basically what

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.750 
the poker world and but basically what
it<00:00:36.149> is<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.719> when<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.050> buy<00:00:37.260> in<00:00:37.320> for<00:00:37.829> less<00:00:38.460> than

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
it is is when you buy in for less than

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.280 
it is is when you buy in for less than
the<00:00:39.000> allotted<00:00:39.270> hundred<00:00:39.719> big<00:00:39.870> blinds<00:00:40.079> in<00:00:40.260> the

the allotted hundred big blinds in the
cash<00:00:40.530> game<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.010> specifically<00:00:41.850> I'd<00:00:42.090> say<00:00:42.239> less

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
cash game and specifically I'd say less

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.360 
cash game and specifically I'd say less
than<00:00:42.780> 30<00:00:43.110> big<00:00:43.440> blinds<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:43.920> would<00:00:44.040> say<00:00:44.129> would<00:00:44.280> be

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
than 30 big blinds I would say would be

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.090

are going to be a lot simpler when you

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.459 
are going to be a lot simpler when you
when<00:00:51.239> you're<00:00:51.360> more<00:00:51.719> short<00:00:51.989> stacks<00:00:52.260> you're

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
when you're more short stacks you're

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.709 
when you're more short stacks you're
going<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.680> be<00:00:52.800> all-in<00:00:53.370> preflop<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:54.030> lot<00:00:54.239> you're

not gonna be put to tough decisions by

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.979 
not gonna be put to tough decisions by
good<00:00:56.370> players<00:00:56.640> on<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.090> turn<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.539> River<00:00:57.719> there

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
good players on the turn and River there

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.349 
good players on the turn and River there
later<00:00:58.230> streets<00:00:58.649> when<00:00:58.890> hands<00:00:59.430> can<00:00:59.699> get<00:00:59.850> complex

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
later streets when hands can get complex

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.900 
later streets when hands can get complex
but<00:01:00.989> in<00:01:01.140> my<00:01:01.320> opinion<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.920> negatives<00:01:02.579> of

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
but in my opinion the negatives of

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.640 
but in my opinion the negatives of
playing<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.329> short<00:01:03.570> stack<00:01:03.840> far<00:01:04.170> outweigh<00:01:04.470> the

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
playing a short stack far outweigh the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.859 
playing a short stack far outweigh the
positives<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.820> guess<00:01:06.180> it's<00:01:06.330> time<00:01:06.600> to

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
positives and so I guess it's time to

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.050 
positives and so I guess it's time to
look<00:01:07.110> at<00:01:07.380> what<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.189> benefits<00:01:08.549> are<00:01:08.610> playing<00:01:08.880> a

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060

for the lesser inexperienced players and

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.170 
for the lesser inexperienced players and
for<00:02:01.500> people<00:02:01.649> trying<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.399> take<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.579> shot<00:02:02.820> maybe<00:02:03.060> a

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
for people trying to take a shot maybe a

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.810 
for people trying to take a shot maybe a
higher<00:02:04.140> level<00:02:04.409> you<00:02:05.369> know<00:02:05.490> there<00:02:05.670> can<00:02:05.790> be

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
higher level you know there can be

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.670 
higher level you know there can be
opportunities<00:02:05.939> where<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:07.049> know<00:02:07.200> it's<00:02:07.619> a

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
opportunities where you know it's a

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.290 
opportunities where you know it's a
crutch<00:02:07.860> rusty<00:02:08.190> as<00:02:08.280> well<00:02:08.459> but<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:09.000> think<00:02:09.209> the

crutch rusty as well but I think the

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.820 
crutch rusty as well but I think the
main<00:02:09.569> thing<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:09.840> take<00:02:09.959> away<00:02:10.259> from<00:02:10.319> this<00:02:10.619> is
