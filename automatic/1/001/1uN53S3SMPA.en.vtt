00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.090
 m 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:12.709
 reason for this type of customer then 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:16.159
 have to worry 

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:18.880
 wardrobes for her words 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.679
 here than look like something against what 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:24.679
 the conclusion of something new 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.109
 the main idea is economic growth because 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.369
 he is convinced that work question 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:32.300
 plainly and now no one can 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.810
 First of all 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.909
 all together with the floor 

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:39.149
 there was no matter in what form it 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.209
 made on the basis of these places yet 

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:42.920
 stayed 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.660
 but generally very tiring percentage 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.660
 by 90 and universal jubilation 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.570
 the doors open are generally very noticeable 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.440
 door barrels 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.440
 we serve what sound she gives 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.160
 here is to fasten back 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.030
 this one from this side 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.420
 she stood task 820 money just decided 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.730
 never used 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.620
 from this side below it is such allow 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.620
 to myself 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.570
 future 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.330
 the company that founded 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.330
 tells me that katia time 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.640
 rub that is here I noticed he 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.880
 trying to fail 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.700
 m 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.490
 4 continues 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.860
 but even me how to pursue my 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.860
 attract 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:36.479
 that's all 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.659
 I thought I would play in the world just 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:39.930
 not 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.230
 here it started about somewhere through 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.330
 one and a half two months after use 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.270
 the temple 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.520
 these are why there is no choice no way 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.320
 that's moving very interesting 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.740
 but it's not about his rules there are many 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.590
 said in such a way that was terminated 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.619
 but here 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.910
 to the bottom book plate 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.020
 bottom and it turns out that way words 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.129
 but just when is it 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:12.519
 however just broke 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:14.639
 Kazan is also a very interesting subject. 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:17.819
 here in the middle already gone because 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.669
 oddly enough he resorted to 

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:22.759
 that's just on paper but apparently decided in 

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:25.249
 yourself ok 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:26.289
 square 

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:29.439
 company stross can even choosing 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:30.409
 it's full 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:33.549
 solving problems that are not ready 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.939
 here with which requests so 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:37.759
 according to the story 

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:40.299
 he always stood in order to raise 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.299
 plastic no words when there will be 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:46.379
 so do not save 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.279
 resignation question 

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:50.059
 will just overwhelm 

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:53.059
 or order at the moment 

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.669
