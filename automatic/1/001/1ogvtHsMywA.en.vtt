00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
wondering I got a cold my head's been

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:05.100 
wondering I got a cold my head's been
stopped<00:00:56.879> up<00:00:57.059> on<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:57.629> here<00:00:58.559> we<00:00:58.680> go

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:03:58.710 

you

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.680 

okay<00:03:59.720> so<00:03:59.780> that's<00:04:00.110> pretty<00:04:00.380> much<00:04:00.470> what<00:04:00.860> it<00:04:01.010> does

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
okay so that's pretty much what it does

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.420 
okay so that's pretty much what it does
it<00:04:02.690> does<00:04:02.870> respond<00:04:03.230> to<00:04:03.260> music<00:04:03.440> and<00:04:03.920> also<00:04:04.250> just

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
it does respond to music and also just

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.650 
it does respond to music and also just
flashes<00:04:04.910> without<00:04:05.240> music<00:04:05.600> and<00:04:06.520> I<00:04:07.520> believe<00:04:08.480> it's

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
flashes without music and I believe it's

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.240 
flashes without music and I believe it's
like<00:04:08.690> five<00:04:09.230> and<00:04:09.500> three<00:04:09.650> quarters<00:04:10.010> of<00:04:10.070> an<00:04:10.130> inch

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
like five and three quarters of an inch

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.200 
like five and three quarters of an inch
wives<00:04:10.610> almost<00:04:11.420> the<00:04:11.540> size<00:04:11.720> of<00:04:11.840> a<00:04:11.930> CD<00:04:13.000> it's<00:04:14.000> got

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:14.210 
wives almost the size of a CD it's got

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.520 
wives almost the size of a CD it's got
48<00:04:14.600> LEDs<00:04:15.170> as<00:04:15.470> eight<00:04:15.710> watts<00:04:16.150> and<00:04:17.150> it<00:04:18.049> does<00:04:18.290> hang

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
48 LEDs as eight watts and it does hang

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.940 
48 LEDs as eight watts and it does hang
on<00:04:18.680> the<00:04:18.769> wall<00:04:18.920> so<00:04:20.260> you<00:04:21.260> have<00:04:21.380> these<00:04:21.500> two<00:04:21.709> little

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
on the wall so you have these two little

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.990 
on the wall so you have these two little
holes<00:04:22.910> here<00:04:23.180> to<00:04:23.300> hang<00:04:23.450> on<00:04:23.570> the<00:04:23.630> wall<00:04:25.000> then

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
holes here to hang on the wall then

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.980 
holes here to hang on the wall then
there's<00:04:26.210> the<00:04:27.370> LEDs<00:04:28.370> right<00:04:28.550> in<00:04:28.730> there<00:04:28.940> all<00:04:29.870> the

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
there's the LEDs right in there all the

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.140 
there's the LEDs right in there all the
components<00:04:30.500> are<00:04:30.590> in<00:04:30.680> this<00:04:30.800> little

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
components are in this little

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.130 
components are in this little
good-looking<00:04:32.150> thing<00:04:32.270> right<00:04:32.450> here<00:04:32.630> that<00:04:32.690> runs

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
good-looking thing right here that runs

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.990 
good-looking thing right here that runs
it<00:04:35.680> one<00:04:36.680> of<00:04:36.830> the<00:04:36.890> things<00:04:36.950> I<00:04:37.310> really<00:04:37.580> don't<00:04:37.790> like

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
it one of the things I really don't like

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.120 
it one of the things I really don't like
about<00:04:38.240> these<00:04:38.510> is<00:04:38.570> they<00:04:39.230> have<00:04:39.410> aluminum<00:04:39.860> wiring

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
about these is they have aluminum wiring

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.160 
about these is they have aluminum wiring
and<00:04:40.700> the<00:04:40.820> wiring<00:04:41.030> is<00:04:41.240> really<00:04:41.570> small<00:04:41.870> in<00:04:42.080> them

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.170 
and the wiring is really small in them

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:48.390 
and the wiring is really small in them
and<00:04:43.160> the<00:04:43.870> plug<00:04:44.870> itself<00:04:45.290> is<00:04:45.530> also<00:04:45.830> aluminum<00:04:46.250> and

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
and the plug itself is also aluminum and

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.350 
and the plug itself is also aluminum and
really<00:04:49.400> shouldn't<00:04:49.669> eat<00:04:49.850> stuff<00:04:50.030> like<00:04:50.090> out<00:04:50.330> here

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
really shouldn't eat stuff like out here

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.730 
really shouldn't eat stuff like out here
in<00:04:50.600> the<00:04:50.660> United<00:04:50.960> States<00:04:51.260> because<00:04:51.470> of<00:04:51.590> the

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
in the United States because of the

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.420 
in the United States because of the
power<00:04:52.400> and<00:04:52.550> over<00:04:52.900> but<00:04:53.900> anyway<00:04:54.350> that's<00:04:55.160> the

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
power and over but anyway that's the

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:01.300 
power and over but anyway that's the
light<00:04:58.090> you<00:04:59.090> can<00:04:59.240> see<00:04:59.650> how<00:05:00.650> big<00:05:00.830> it<00:05:00.860> is<00:05:01.040> by<00:05:01.160> my

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
light you can see how big it is by my

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:09.130 
light you can see how big it is by my
hand<00:05:02.500> some<00:05:03.500> flower<00:05:03.710> LED<00:05:04.190> light<00:05:07.960> there<00:05:08.960> all

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.140 
hand some flower LED light there all

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.170 
hand some flower LED light there all
around<00:05:09.560> the<00:05:09.950> base<00:05:10.430> it<00:05:10.640> kinda<00:05:10.910> looks<00:05:11.030> like<00:05:11.060> a

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
around the base it kinda looks like a

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.500 
around the base it kinda looks like a
little<00:05:11.210> UFO<00:05:12.700> there<00:05:13.700> all<00:05:13.880> along<00:05:14.150> that<00:05:14.330> little

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
little UFO there all along that little

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.640 
little UFO there all along that little
base<00:05:16.510> there's<00:05:17.510> red<00:05:17.690> green<00:05:17.930> and<00:05:18.080> yellow<00:05:18.110> in<00:05:18.530> it
