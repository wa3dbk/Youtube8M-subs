00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 a rectangular over a big cardboard box 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.549
 It seems more at first sight 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.620
 not to be 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.900
 but that's behind it 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.170
 research project instant home of the tu 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.299
 darmstadt the instant home is one out 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.760
 foldable house for refugees that the 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.010
 subject areas chemistry architecture and 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.859
 mechanical engineering have developed together 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.720
 architect ariel Auslender follows with it 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:29.760
 a humanitarian goal 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:32.099
 The idea is to help so easy 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.680
 that would be me so i help a situation 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.340
 in a catastrophic situation, I advise 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.540
 fast uncomplicated and with 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:46.579
 materials that are biodegradable 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.579
 to be on the spot quickly and one 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.329
 wonderful environment pretty fast 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.239
 to build up 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.090
 a house that can be used quickly 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.859
 in catastrophic situations, it must 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.739
 are water-repellent, among other 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.799
 this is what markus beer salt deals with 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.650
 be key specialized in the 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:08.689
 Macromolecular and paper chemistry 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.000
 so we are especially concerned 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:17.030
 with coating materials for paper 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.030
 in this project like an example 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:24.090
 that's why we're especially concerned 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.290
 Strive surfaces of papers that 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.180
 to equip firmly 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.430
 that means they are water repellent 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.530
 properties 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:35.510
 Keep concepts and concepts high 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.610
 Who will give dry home 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:41.300
 the center but speak to 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.970
 but also that is a dream 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.550
 structurally preserves its integrity 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.020
 not only the material but also the structure 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.150
 play in the development of the 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.119
 Parking garage plays a decisive role 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.550
 stable it should be and still easy 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.290
 to transport 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:02.240
 engineer samuel cable ensures high 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:04.100
 Strength expresses little material russians 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.649
 a top layer with very stable 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.330
 long fibers and in the middle of these 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.900
 were structures that actually bring 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.520
 only the outer layers apart 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:16.010
 we engineers of the areas 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.200
 moment of inertia that then leads to that 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.990
 one with very little material very high 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.270
 strength gets 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.520
 the idea for this project is in one 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.500
 seminar at the department of architecture for 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.450
 created a sculptural design 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.850
 here the students had to 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.850
 especially with fall techniques 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.850
 deal with 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:42.700
 the specialists who have sensational 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.070
 stuff made in paper folded 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.280
 papers with which we have with the 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:53.620
 studying workshops made in folds 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:55.990
 thanks to the weavers a popup home 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.670
 cooperation of the three subject areas 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.020
 from the student project 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.910
 become a prototype 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.280
 Now the three involved are hoping 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.960
 professors also partner outside the 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.960
 to gain university for the project
