00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
you see that this blade tension it's

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
you see that this blade tension it's
it's<00:00:57.000> big<00:00:57.420> one<00:00:58.100> as<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.340> see<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.870> plate<00:01:00.870> is

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
it's big one as you see the plate is

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:08.300 
it's big one as you see the plate is
bigger<00:01:03.080> compared<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.580> the<00:01:05.580> compact<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:07.310> this

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
bigger compared to the compact and this

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.350 
bigger compared to the compact and this
is<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.840> problem<00:01:09.840> this<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.380> good<00:01:11.060> if<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.270> are

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
is the problem this is good if you are

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.940 
is the problem this is good if you are
outdoors<00:01:13.320> or<00:01:13.920> whatever<00:01:14.250> but<00:01:15.710> for<00:01:16.710> everyday

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
outdoors or whatever but for everyday

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.340 
outdoors or whatever but for everyday
use<00:01:17.400> this<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:18.470> pretty<00:01:19.470> stiff<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.130> open<00:01:21.350> the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
use this is pretty stiff to open the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.789 
use this is pretty stiff to open the
plate<00:01:22.590> tension<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.130> very<00:01:23.939> high

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
plate tension is very high

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.210 
plate tension is very high
expecially<00:01:25.799> these<00:01:26.220> small<00:01:27.119> ones<00:01:27.950> it's<00:01:28.950> good

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
expecially these small ones it's good

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.030 
expecially these small ones it's good
when<00:01:29.460> you're<00:01:29.729> using<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.210> but<00:01:30.740> usually<00:01:31.740> the

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
when you're using it but usually the

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.789 
when you're using it but usually the
problem<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.490> just<00:01:33.270> opening<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.960> that's<00:01:34.619> the

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
problem is just opening it that's the

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:41.660 
problem is just opening it that's the
problem<00:01:35.070> in<00:01:35.310> normal<00:01:36.049> normal<00:01:37.049> use<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:40.670> that's

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
problem in normal normal use and that's

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.170 
problem in normal normal use and that's
why<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.500> have<00:01:43.500> this<00:01:43.710> but<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.040> hardly<00:01:44.399> knavery<00:01:44.909> I

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
why I have this but I hardly knavery I

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.450 
why I have this but I hardly knavery I
just<00:01:45.570> keep<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.869> in<00:01:45.990> my<00:01:46.140> car<00:01:46.610> and<00:01:49.070> what<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.100> carry

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
just keep it in my car and what I carry

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.359 
just keep it in my car and what I carry
is<00:01:50.610> this<00:01:50.880> one<00:01:51.350> and<00:01:52.350> also<00:01:52.500> one<00:01:52.829> reason<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.340> that

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
is this one and also one reason is that

00:01:53.369 --> 00:02:01.800 
is this one and also one reason is that
the<00:01:55.880> tension<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:56.969> very<00:01:58.159> like<00:01:59.159> ease

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.510 

also<00:02:02.810> it's<00:02:03.590> much<00:02:03.770> more<00:02:04.009> versatile<00:02:04.789> and<00:02:05.710> I<00:02:06.710> want

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
also it's much more versatile and I want

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.040 
also it's much more versatile and I want
to<00:02:08.479> row

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
to row

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.640 
to row
I<00:02:09.080> don't<00:02:09.920> want<00:02:10.129> those<00:02:10.340> four<00:02:10.789> or<00:02:11.090> three<00:02:11.410> or<00:02:12.410> more

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
I don't want those four or three or more

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.309 
I don't want those four or three or more
because<00:02:13.040> I<00:02:13.190> want<00:02:13.400> it<00:02:13.580> to<00:02:13.760> be<00:02:13.940> on<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:14.989> pocket

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
because I want it to be on the pocket

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.280 
because I want it to be on the pocket
that<00:02:15.560> it's<00:02:15.769> thinner<00:02:16.280> this<00:02:16.640> way<00:02:17.140> compared<00:02:18.140> to

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
that it's thinner this way compared to

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.610 
that it's thinner this way compared to
this<00:02:18.410> way<00:02:18.680> if<00:02:19.160> you<00:02:19.370> buy<00:02:20.120> more<00:02:20.330> than<00:02:20.569> three<00:02:21.500> or

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
this way if you buy more than three or

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.759 
this way if you buy more than three or
four<00:02:22.209> you<00:02:23.209> eat<00:02:23.420> cook<00:02:23.690> carries<00:02:24.319> in<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:24.440> pocket

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
four you eat cook carries in the pocket

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.940 
four you eat cook carries in the pocket
like<00:02:24.920> this<00:02:25.840> because<00:02:26.840> it's<00:02:27.019> thinner<00:02:27.470> that<00:02:27.769> way

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
like this because it's thinner that way

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.119 
like this because it's thinner that way
and<00:02:28.569> this<00:02:29.569> is<00:02:29.690> much<00:02:29.870> more<00:02:30.080> versatile<00:02:30.680> because

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.129 
and this is much more versatile because

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:36.330 
and this is much more versatile because
I<00:02:31.519> have<00:02:31.849> scissors<00:02:32.980> and<00:02:33.980> got<00:02:34.190> my<00:02:34.400> finger<00:02:35.390> nails

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
different this has a multi multi use

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.660 
different this has a multi multi use
that<00:02:46.400> is<00:02:46.579> flat<00:02:46.849> hit<00:02:47.230> bottle<00:02:48.230> opener<00:02:48.680> and<00:02:48.950> also

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670

are separate but bottle and can but in

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.610 
are separate but bottle and can but in
this<00:02:59.420> one<00:02:59.629> they're<00:02:59.870> combined<00:03:00.440> and<00:03:01.209> easy

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620
