00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 I hope you always remember that 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:10.650
 I did the unboxing of lg what's good 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:14.099
 Well now I have another the shaft the shaft 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.170
 woods r is to say round and while I 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.730
 I prepare the review since I'm 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.160
 trying I'll explain a little bit 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:27.150
 how is this the clock that just 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:29.390
 present the axis in and factory as you see 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.099
 round super elegant and is more 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.770
 anyone would say it 's a clock 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.890
 Smart works with android wear 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.379
 how it works this is the lg watch what 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.420
 things have so they make it stand out 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.170
 Well, to start a steel box 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.079
 polished 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.449
 that borders all this part of here 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.850
 in the back we have the 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.710
 heart rate monitor that will help us to be able 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.449
 control our heart rate because 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.219
 of course also this clock we 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.620
 allows to quantify our activity 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.629
 daily you see here these pins or they sound 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.989
 so they are the same loading purposes 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.670
 that already had the drawing with which what 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.770
 The only thing we need is the backpack of 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.240
 load to be able to load it and that she to 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:15.140
 through micro usb 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.149
 13 inch screen you see this part of 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.220
 here, this part of here is the 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:21.320
 crown that makes it look like a watch 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.220
 much more more classic and more 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.960
 sports to which we are 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.450
 used but of course what 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.119
 inside is all all all intelligence 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.860
 you also see the strap these straps are 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.320
 interchangeable since the strap is 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.479
 standard right now we are in the mode 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.990
 of landscapes screen by some photos 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:41.570
 super nice that also change to 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.429
 as we go on lighting the clock 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.890
 but if what we want is a wait 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:47.869
 more traditional because we only have to 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.909
 choose between the available spheres and 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.610
 For example, let's put this one 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.350
 I put a lot in addition almost all the 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.530
 spheres are darker for you to consume 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.659
 less battery than by the way the battery 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.819
 is 410 milliamps and it gives 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.580
 approximately one autonomy of a pair 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:06.140
 of days as you see a little button here that 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.810
 It also allows us to move between 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:13.989
 menus and of course we have the already 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.989
 known or key google that would allow us 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.530
 inside 4 gigas of storage 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.930
 for national google apps 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.010
 and of course bluetooth 4.0 so that it 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.900
 can synchronize with our 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.569
 mobile device is compatible with 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.780
 any kind of android from the 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.370
 version 4.3 with what we can 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.680
 to do is simply download us from the 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.600
 play store the android wear application 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.640
 and start to mess with the 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.920
 different applications so we can 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.260
 receive all notifications 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.440
 directly in our smart world 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.750
 awards r will be available at the end of 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.160
 year in this last quarter we do not know 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.260
 still when and we do not know the 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.880
 price but like us that we have 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.300
 a very fine calculator we calculate that 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.590
 will be around 250 we go that as 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.569
 I will be handling the cards 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.310
 credit because I know perfectly price that 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.319
 will have mostly because the competition 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.110
 has about those prices and not 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.140
 you can go much higher 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:12.460
 so eclipse this has been all we 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.460
 we see in the next video bye bye
