 South of the skin is worn by personnel not deulyigo book as a singer for the album Ring

 This guy looks like he 's got a singer. 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:21.490
 There is such an emotion in the actress Kim Hyung Joong . 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:24.150
 You make us look a little relaxation so generous heart, tell him 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.660
 special 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:33.690
 I'm feeling that before the air would be a book 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:38.160
 Uh, I've been taking pictures for quite a while , 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:43.200
 So it's been over a decade. 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:47.700
 I hid things I took pictures of as a hobby. 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.650
 As you can imagine in Title 39 of this book 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.000
 I am now 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:58.950
 Gotta have that situation is beyond the heart has 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.940
 Before I get to mind , I organize my photos. 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.540
 I have lived until now, that my sort of 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:09.830
 My 3 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:12.080
 There was a need me to organize myself a bit so in a sense to organize it. 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:16.640
 I made a book . 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:19.550
 I did not really think I'd get a book at all . 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.510
 Someone does not say it's a book. 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.459
 I did it a little bit. 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:31.810
 Ah 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:34.749
 Actually, I did not know the image itself 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:39.489
 I thought a little differently. 

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:40.359
 In fact, it is so full of power that there is a lot of information to readers 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.150
 give 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:47.640
 Good and good to give 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.640
 There may be some useful books like that . 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:54.799
 Others are evoking sympathy even just to tell people just to see another 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.239
 I can comfort you. 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:05.510
 You can remind yourself of the memories you've learned, 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:08.780
 I think it's the book that has the potential to become a book. 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:13.609
 There 's nothing I can not do as a book. 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:16.920
 I thought I could be one of those infinite possibilities. 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:20.490
 Take it to Samcheok, Gangwon-do 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:23.970
 I took a picture of a streetlight on a beach street. 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:29.190
 Here we see now is going streetlight Seagull 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:33.090
 A street lamp with a shape and a 2 light streetlight with a sky The beautiful sky is even more beautiful 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:35.850
 I'm trying to figure it out so I can shoot with the sky background . 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:40.980
 A seagull is flying now 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:43.920
 I took this picture of a streetlight sitting . 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:47.170
 Maybe 2000 will be 4 years 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.260
 I thought the heart stopped. 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.730
 I thought you were walking to me. 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.640
 It will only look like this in my eyes 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:04:03.430
 There are too many people who look like you on the street today. 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:09.370
 I look at myself alone, looking at the backward look of the person who resembles you 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:11.950
 I do not know how long I've been apart from my girlfriend 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:17.829
 At the time of the aftereffects. 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:18.970
 But why break after such an experience and their loved people almost know 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:24.190
 It is. 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:28.990
 When I go on the road and look at the person's resemblance, I just get out of the way. 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:31.120
 When looking at the appearance of a seagull sitting on a lamppost Seagull chew true 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:35.360
 I think that 4 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:40.340
 Ah Version 6 also reported that street lights 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:42.950
 Whoever remembers and sees the union. 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:48.800
 This guy also loves me 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:51.560
 I think she 's parting with her. 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:55.760
 People speak many words 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:58.700
 I am now inspired by various experiences and things to start there 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.730
 You write lyrics and make your own work. 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.730
 uh 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:06.889
 Some states such that any new experience yiradeunga who inspired me the music 

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:12.829
 Whether 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:16.129
 It's precious to me. Before I take a picture, I actually experience it myself. 

00:05:12.829 --> 00:05:20.869
 Those feelings that I could not have known 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:24.079
 And the minds of other people who could not even think of it. 

00:05:20.869 --> 00:05:29.779
 Some of the others 

00:05:24.079 --> 00:05:31.159
 Experience these things and that person is just the place itself is there for me 

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:36.109
 Feelings of giving 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:36.979
 I could not think of before you take good pictures just yireongeo MD lyrics 

00:05:36.109 --> 00:05:40.639
 Write 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:44.929
 The stories I heard around that experienced one 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:47.359
 I wrote this song with lyrics and I made music to match it. 

00:05:44.929 --> 00:05:51.769
 I was taking pictures. 

00:05:47.359 --> 00:05:53.059
 I usually contemplate all those things that I could not care about 

00:05:51.769 --> 00:05:57.379
 See doedeoraguyo 

00:05:53.059 --> 00:06:04.070
 Then I felt while watching the two books one 

00:05:57.379 --> 00:06:09.170
 I could feel the senators and the happy feelings together . 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:12.230
 I hope that it will be good music and good pictures 5 

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:14.710
