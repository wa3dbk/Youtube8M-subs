00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.820
It's nothing new to the athletic community,
something known as nutrient timing.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.320
It'll make all the difference in the world
as to whether or not all the time you wasted

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.800
in the gym was well spent or if it was wasted.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.820
Because the fact of the matter is, after an
intense, hard work out and really putting

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.539
your muscles through some serious overload
and some damage, your body is starving for

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:32.689
specific nutrients and starving for specific
carbohydrates to replenish your glycogen stores

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.399
and to feed your muscles the protein that
it needs.

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.690
This is where the post-workout window comes
into play.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:46.550
You have approximately 15 minutes to about
30 to 35 minutes to feed your body specific

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.150
portions of proteins, carbs, and maybe even
specific amino acids.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.760
While some would argue that window stretches
out a little bit further and it doesn't have

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.830
to be within the first 15 minutes to 30 minutes,
the more and more they study this the more

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.720
they come out with the belief that it really
needs to be as soon as possible.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.530
And it needs to be in liquid form because
it's going to digest the fastest into your

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.530
bloodstream.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.570
So, what you want to do is you want to make
yourself a shake.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.660
You want to have it ready, already prepared,
when you get to the gym so you can just grab

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:16.660
it out of your gym bag.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.470
Or, if not, have the components ready.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.620
You can mix it all with some water, or you
can choose to use some kind of high glycemic

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.440
juice if that works well for you.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:31.260
You want to have a protein powder that's fast
acting, egg protein, whey protein is probably

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.260
best.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.430
You also want to have a high glycemic carbohydrate
powder, unless you're going to be using juice

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.990
- then the amount of carb powder you use can
obviously be brought down.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.010
The protein powder, anywhere from 25 to 35
grams of protein.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.620
You can have upwards of 40 or 45, but at some
point your body's only going to digest only

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:52.620
so much.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.070
And I'm assuming you're also maybe going to
have a meal after that following the shake

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.760
maybe an hour and a half to two hours later.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.590
So, you want to have protein 25 to 35 grams
of quality protein, whey.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.790
You want to have carbohydrate, high glycemic,
anywhere from 35, 45, maybe even 50 grams

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.539
of high quality carbohydrate powder, malto-dextrin,
dextrose powder.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:17.130
And, again, you can also get your carbohydrates
through a different type of sugar.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:23.540
It's interesting how after a workout your
body will allow you to absorb sugar better

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.730
than any other time of the day.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.810
So it's a good time after a workout to have
that sugary beverage if that is the time of

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:32.980
the day when you want to have it.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.730
Maybe use that as the base for the cocktail
that you're going to make post-workout.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.520
The last two things I would throw in there
are amino acids - branch chain amino acids,

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.150
BCAA's - and glutamine.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:53.630
BCAA's is going to help to rehydrate the muscle
cell and keep the muscle cell anabolic.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.709
At the same time glutamine is going to do
the same thing, but it's also going to help

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:02.120
force more water into the muscle as well which
is also going to help the muscle to rehydrate

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.160
and even begin to heal and recover faster.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.220
Glutamine is also going to bring down cortisol
levels which are rising pretty quickly after

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.670
an intense workout if you train correctly
and if you train heavy enough.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.280
So, glutamine, BCAA's, carbohydrate powder,
and protein powder, and maybe a little bit

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.280
of juice.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.900
Try this shake after every workout.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.849
I guarantee that you'll notice incredible
difference in your rate to recovery and your

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:26.720
muscle size and growth.
