00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.050
 between the good cries autosport and the arrivals 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.520
 of the next autumn the appetites of the 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.250
 motor enthusiasts will be 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.019
 certainly appease yourself properly in this 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.329
 2014 but if on the one hand we will have strength 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:28.429
 horizon 2 and the other drive club 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:29.599
 ubisoft has a title ready for everyone 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.400
 very different from the usual 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.689
 that the crew that wants to distance themselves from the gods 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.460
 automotive titles as we have them 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.290
 understood until today trying 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.149
 ambitiously to prove to what extent 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.040
 point can extend the horizon of a 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.690
 kind finally ready to overcome the 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.090
 barriers that technology imposed on them 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.950
 the crew is not a title suitable for one 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.320
 fair nor at a press event 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.090
 it is not a hit and run game 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.920
 a couple of races are enough to do it 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.570
 an idea on global quality and on 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.490
 state of work in progress 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.380
 it is a huge game packed 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.120
 the activities to be performed situations 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.590
 different to manage and full of 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.780
 possibility that in a short half hour 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.460
 you would never catch a glimpse for 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.560
 this is the beta on which we have 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.270
 past several hours was the solution 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.979
 better to understand what was the 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.230
 scope of this promising new ip 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.820
 which mixes the philosophy of the menu with one 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.430
 freedom of movement on four wheels 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.080
 unmatched in the crew you can 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.970
 freely traverse the united states 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.130
 of America in a map that with the due 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.810
 proportions is a scale reproduction 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.680
 I have boundless star territory 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.240
 Stripes 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.740
 just think that to move from one 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.270
 costs to the other of the uses we have 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.460
 employed something like forty 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.510
 of minutes without ever being interrupted by 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.830
 an upload 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.900
 which suggests by now 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.610
 like the bass world of the open world 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.229
 if one of the strongest points of strength 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.430
 of the entire production 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.470
 of course to get results 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.390
 some had to be found some 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.159
 technical compromises and that is why 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.820
 sometimes the depth of field is not 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.920
 of the best 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.479
 the effect is still a bit buzzing e 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.049
 graphically we are made there by 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.240
 excesses 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.280
 however, it must be said that the global system and 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.049
 enjoyable and that fluidity indeed 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.610
 it is almost never affected even when 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.049
 you are in the midst of portions of 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.880
 street where crowding is done 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:03.710
 important element not at all 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.240
 negligible if you consider the game 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.340
 is obliged to adopt a style of 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.330
 driving often very unscrupulous either 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.430
 predicts its unquestionable nature 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.420
 both because the missions themselves are 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.070
 request it loudly 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.050
 despite the considerable size 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.910
 of the game world that the amount of 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.390
 emissions secondary activities to carry 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.430
 complete 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.350
 beck does his best not to put 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.190
 in awe the player and indeed it 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.840
 accompanies gradually 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.090
 in learning without ever doing it 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.460
 feeling lost you start as always 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.900
 from below a couple of missions they give 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.970
 an overview of the situation of the 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.470
 protagonist from which one unfolds 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.760
 story that doesn't look exactly like 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.620
 more original but all in all 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.390
 we found it suitable for the context 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.850
 a text that pushes you to create a new one 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.320
 crew by adding friends on uplay and 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.030
 face the raids in this way 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.130
 cooperative demonstrating the fact 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.600
 that the multiplayer component has had 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.459
 a not inconsiderable weight during the 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.410
 project conception naturally 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.180
 you can choose to play solo 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.740
 without suffering any kind of handicap 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.570
 and even if going on the game 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.980
 becomes less lenient during 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.690
 We have no more advanced missions 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.090
 felt the need for outside help 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.860
 the progress is structured on missions 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.930
 that follow an ideal line along the 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.030
 main storyline and others on it 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.470
 branch independently by helping 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.459
 the player to increase his 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.560
 experience like a game 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.120
 the care of these go on 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.160
 addressed further for obvious reasons 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.810
 the imbalances that rival them while others 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.250
 still need certain 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.470
 characteristics of the cars for 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.330
 to be able to take part we begin a 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.130
 connect street and then go to the 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.519
 more extreme tuning or sections out 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.230
 Street 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.180
 at this point a 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.160
 very complex furniture system 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.150
 car that goes from the internal parts up to 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.850
 get to the aesthetic changes 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.220
 including decals the note of 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.930
 decrees is not only vast and also much 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.060
 full of tasks to complete 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.560
 all along the roads to go 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.600
 in addition to keeping busy during 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.769
 crossings where a certain variety that is 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.320
 adds to the diversification 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.640
 of the missions that already from this beta there 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.130
 it looked pretty good and well 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.320
 studied by racing between skids and 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.489
 abuse behind the pursuits up to 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.060
 get to the big tours and the 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.950
 police 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.720
 the crews try not to miss it 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.610
 really nothing in terms of content 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.260
 the appearance that instead needs a 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.060
 more finishing work is without 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.000
 doubt the driving model still some 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.720
 inaccurate and to balance properly 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.310
 possible to innovate with arrogance too 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.750
 good for racing to make this happen 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.520
 to happen has decided to create a model 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.130
 hybrid that seems to really work 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.260
 well the potentials are several ed 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.910
 already evident from the beta but to make of 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.290
 the tune memorable game must 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.660
 arrange different aspects again 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.670
 limping and securing players one 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:31.650
 variety and a superior global quality 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.650
 compared to what was found in life
