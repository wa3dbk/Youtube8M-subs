they had the first bike with direct
power<00:01:19.950> measurement<00:01:20.549> we<00:01:20.670> found<00:01:20.970> out<00:01:21.180> that

power measurement we found out that

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.480 
power measurement we found out that
they're<00:01:21.600> only<00:01:21.810> measuring<00:01:22.350> power<00:01:22.590> on<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.159> left

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490

they're only measuring power on the left
crank<00:01:24.000> arm<00:01:24.270> only<00:01:25.700> maybe<00:01:26.700> we'll<00:01:26.909> wait<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.180> year

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
or two and see if they're still around

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.609 
or two and see if they're still around
and<00:01:29.310> we'll<00:01:29.810> consider<00:01:30.810> carrying<00:01:31.110> them<00:01:31.380> again

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
and we'll consider carrying them again

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.100 
and we'll consider carrying them again
we've<00:01:31.770> also<00:01:31.950> I've<00:01:32.579> tested<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.450> belt<00:01:33.750> drive

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
we've also I've tested the belt drive

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.429 
we've also I've tested the belt drive

not proven free motion claims it's just

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.560 
not proven free motion claims it's just
like<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.329> chain<00:01:45.750> just<00:01:46.229> like<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.470> belt<00:01:46.829> but<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.729> find

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
like a chain just like a belt but I find

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.569 
like a chain just like a belt but I find
it<00:01:48.689> hard<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:49.020> believe<00:01:49.189> that<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.280> could<00:01:50.430> have<00:01:50.549> a

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
it hard to believe that you could have a

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.130 
it hard to believe that you could have a
belt<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:51.149> feels<00:01:51.360> like<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.600> chain<00:01:51.930> when<00:01:52.110> I

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
belt that feels like a chain when I

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.310 
belt that feels like a chain when I
wrote<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.530> at<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.829> tradeshow<00:01:53.720> I<00:01:54.720> was

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
wrote it at the tradeshow I was

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.850 
wrote it at the tradeshow I was
underwhelmed<00:01:56.310> would<00:01:56.610> be<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.990> right<00:01:58.200> word<00:01:58.500> I

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
underwhelmed would be the right word I

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.639 
underwhelmed would be the right word I
think<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.939> correct<00:02:00.210> word<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:01.170> let's<00:02:01.380> look<00:02:01.500> at

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
think the correct word so let's look at

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.740 
think the correct word so let's look at
handlebar<00:02:02.070> differences<00:02:03.560> so<00:02:04.560> this<00:02:04.799> is<00:02:05.040> the

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
handlebar differences so this is the

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.050 
handlebar differences so this is the
free<00:02:06.750> motion<00:02:06.990> handlebar<00:02:07.729> it's<00:02:08.729> actually

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
free motion handlebar it's actually

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.380 
free motion handlebar it's actually
quite<00:02:09.330> barren<00:02:09.959> and<00:02:10.110> naked<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:11.190> have<00:02:11.310> one<00:02:11.550> pipe

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
quite barren and naked you have one pipe

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.339 
quite barren and naked you have one pipe
and<00:02:13.599> the<00:02:13.810> amount<00:02:14.140> of<00:02:14.260> travel<00:02:16.049> it's<00:02:17.049> just<00:02:17.230> a

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
and the amount of travel it's just a

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:22.289 
and the amount of travel it's just a
couple<00:02:17.709> of<00:02:17.799> inches<00:02:18.840> maybe<00:02:19.840> three<00:02:20.200> inches<00:02:21.299> but

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
couple of inches maybe three inches but

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:24.809 
couple of inches maybe three inches but
that's<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.810> free<00:02:23.049> motion<00:02:23.230> handle<00:02:23.709> bar<00:02:23.860> this

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
that's the free motion handle bar this

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:30.509 
that's the free motion handle bar this
is<00:02:24.879> the<00:02:25.299> Kaiser<00:02:25.780> m3<00:02:26.590> handlebar<00:02:27.099> I<00:02:27.450> think<00:02:29.519> the

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
is the Kaiser m3 handlebar I think the
