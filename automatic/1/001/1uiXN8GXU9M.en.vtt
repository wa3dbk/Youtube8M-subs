meet other artists that my same age
that's<00:00:27.820> really<00:00:28.029> fun<00:00:28.210> because<00:00:28.330> it's<00:00:28.570> kind<00:00:28.600> of

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
that's really fun because it's kind of

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.720 
that's really fun because it's kind of
hard<00:00:28.990> to<00:00:29.050> do<00:00:29.590> that<00:00:29.740> at<00:00:29.890> school<00:00:30.130> and<00:00:30.340> not<00:00:30.460> that

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
hard to do that at school and not that

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.220 
hard to do that at school and not that
many<00:00:30.880> kids<00:00:31.150> are<00:00:31.240> interested<00:00:31.630> in<00:00:31.779> it<00:00:31.930> this

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
many kids are interested in it this

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.900 
many kids are interested in it this
morning<00:00:32.559> we<00:00:32.650> went<00:00:32.770> we<00:00:33.070> did<00:00:33.250> sketches<00:00:33.550> of<00:00:33.730> our

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
morning we went we did sketches of our

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.549 
morning we went we did sketches of our
partner<00:00:34.270> they<00:00:34.480> were<00:00:34.540> just<00:00:34.750> really<00:00:34.930> quick<00:00:35.260> and

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
partner they were just really quick and

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.250 
partner they were just really quick and
line<00:00:36.370> drawings<00:00:36.760> you<00:00:36.940> can<00:00:36.970> keep<00:00:37.330> your<00:00:37.510> mind<00:00:38.110> on

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
line drawings you can keep your mind on

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.350 
line drawings you can keep your mind on
the<00:00:38.350> page<00:00:38.559> the<00:00:38.800> entire<00:00:39.070> time<00:00:39.309> I<00:00:39.580> think<00:00:40.239> this

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
the page the entire time I think this

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.509 
the page the entire time I think this
was<00:00:40.629> in<00:00:40.840> left<00:00:41.530> hands<00:00:41.830> using<00:00:42.309> Mike<00:00:42.640> angry<00:00:43.510> marks

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:44.519 
was in left hands using Mike angry marks

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:47.219 
was in left hands using Mike angry marks
so<00:00:45.519> you<00:00:45.610> can<00:00:45.760> see<00:00:45.909> they<00:00:46.089> get<00:00:46.239> kind<00:00:46.479> of<00:00:46.570> weirder

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:47.229 
so you can see they get kind of weirder

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:48.780 
so you can see they get kind of weirder
and<00:00:47.350> weirder<00:00:47.409> to<00:00:47.890> get<00:00:48.010> less<00:00:48.190> control<00:00:48.550> over<00:00:48.580> the

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
and weirder to get less control over the

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.060 
and weirder to get less control over the
pencil<00:00:49.500> experience<00:00:50.500> what<00:00:50.650> you're<00:00:50.830> doing

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
pencil experience what you're doing

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.560 
pencil experience what you're doing
right<00:00:51.280> now<00:00:51.519> I<00:00:51.790> am<00:00:52.049> doing<00:00:53.049> an<00:00:53.199> outline<00:00:53.710> of<00:00:54.570> the

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
right now I am doing an outline of the

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.410 
right now I am doing an outline of the
model<00:00:55.900> here<00:00:56.080> and<00:00:56.500> so<00:00:57.430> when<00:00:57.610> I<00:00:57.640> paint<00:00:58.089> over<00:00:58.390> it

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
model here and so when I paint over it

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.979 
model here and so when I paint over it
in<00:00:58.600> green<00:00:58.930> these<00:00:59.710> lines<00:00:59.949> should<00:01:00.159> come<00:01:00.400> through

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
in green these lines should come through

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.539 
in green these lines should come through
so<00:01:01.989> yeah<00:01:02.619> we'll<00:01:02.769> give<00:01:02.920> me<00:01:02.979> a<00:01:03.040> good<00:01:03.159> outline<00:01:03.489> of

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:03.549 
so yeah we'll give me a good outline of

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:05.430 
so yeah we'll give me a good outline of
what<00:01:03.790> I<00:01:03.850> should<00:01:04.089> pain<00:01:04.269> when<00:01:04.600> I<00:01:04.629> start<00:01:05.199> to<00:01:05.229> do<00:01:05.379> it
