00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.149
 on the nautical base of saint viaud se 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.799
 now erect pylons and a 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:09.750
 funny machinery it's a wake 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.379
 park to practice water skiing without 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.459
 boat named nautical ski lift 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:15.780
 it's a new way finally a 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:16.800
 new that is not quite 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.420
 new that is new to the region 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.019
 in any case it's a new way of 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.820
 propose water skiing in order to 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:24.960
 ecologically economical way so we 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.330
 is really in full development 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.640
 sustainable simply because we have 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.750
 removed the big v8 that we find 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.520
 usually on ski boats 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.809
 nautical through an installation with a 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.239
 electric motor that drives 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.399
 a cable itself drives up to 6 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.680
 people at home simultaneously on the 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.000
 our cable has five hens it is 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.530
 that pulleys and obviously serve to 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.469
 make turns all the way around the 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.539
 body of water is 540 meters long 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.120
 in the past have sought to have 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.289
 ski lift which was very long 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.969
 today we come a little more to 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.350
 in reality because the good 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.239
 riders so the good practices in 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.350
 search for cables with a lot of 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.670
 tension and to have a lot of 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.649
 tensions they make that the course is 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.140
 relatively compact each round goes 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.280
 last a minute and potentially we have 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.890
 a new start every 10 seconds 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.410
 that we try to convey through 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.960
 our slogan by the way that's like 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.220
 azur rights really came as with 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.960
 the level you have with the desires 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.240
 that you have us we take care of the rest 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.620
 we are you are framed by by 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.730
 professionals when you are on site 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.560
 the very good find their account 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.110
 since we have reserved obstacles 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.250
 which are very particular to us we have 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.230
 four world exclusivity out of two 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.340
 parks two now that they are a 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.390
 little less and it was true the year 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.620
 last when we install them and 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.390
 today it sold a little bit 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.830
 more and modules that are really 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.670
 drawn by us what so what 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.670
 will find nowhere else 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.390
 ah ah 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.440
 and 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:14.859
 it's hard and May 24, 2013 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:18.760
 this wake park has seduced the elected 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:20.980
 local face is a very beautiful 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.019
 realization and equipment that is 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.450
 complementary to the tourist offer 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.519
 current and in particular to the offer around 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.379
 water recreation and already rich on 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.819
 our territory that is completely 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:32.829
 in tune with the times since sports 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.959
 are now very popular 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:36.849
 and so go all that will contribute to the 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.049
 dynamism of this municipality and more 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.700
 largely from our territory 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.250
 at first I was a little scared 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.290
 integration into the environment and 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.420
 after having worked together after midday 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.069
 about the style of people who come from 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.049
 outside to 10 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.780
 I had made a good achievement and 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:55.239
 continue we had a heart buzz 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.010
 to install these small pylons in the 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.930
 body of water to denature the site 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.470
 but a body of water that had weakened 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:05.680
 also by its lack of dynamism 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.879
 by his lack of sportsmen who were 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.859
 besides dedicated to 100 at the start 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:11.019
 and well today between satisfied with 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:12.129
 see this lake that was animated and 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.919
 that still come alive excellent die 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:16.510
 still good finally know that this 

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:19.409
 discipline to register for games 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.409
 2020 Olympic Games 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.140
 no
