but the basal ganglia I think it's a

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.800 
but the basal ganglia I think it's a
correct<00:01:41.790> term<00:01:41.910> for<00:01:41.940> the<00:01:42.210> area<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.510> his<00:01:42.600> brain

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
it made motor movement and pretty much

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.109 
it made motor movement and pretty much
every<00:02:03.630> area<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:04.770> mean<00:02:05.310> he<00:02:05.490> could<00:02:05.670> do<00:02:05.790> some<00:02:06.090> very

baby food consistency

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.099 
baby food consistency
he<00:03:13.700> couldn't<00:03:14.030> drink<00:03:14.299> juices<00:03:14.750> or<00:03:14.930> water

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
he couldn't drink juices or water

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:18.280 
he couldn't drink juices or water
straight<00:03:15.590> he<00:03:15.920> would<00:03:16.040> choke<00:03:16.280> and<00:03:16.489> throw<00:03:16.700> up<00:03:17.290> he

straight he would choke and throw up he

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.940 
straight he would choke and throw up he
would<00:03:18.500> always<00:03:19.010> throw<00:03:20.000> up<00:03:20.379> at<00:03:21.379> some<00:03:21.709> point

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
would always throw up at some point

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.289 
would always throw up at some point
during<00:03:22.160> the<00:03:22.370> day<00:03:22.400> pretty<00:03:22.849> much<00:03:22.970> an<00:03:23.180> entire

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
during the day pretty much an entire

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:25.990 
during the day pretty much an entire
meal<00:03:23.720> for<00:03:24.349> the<00:03:24.590> entire<00:03:25.069> previous<00:03:25.400> two<00:03:25.760> meals

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
meal for the entire previous two meals

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.940 
meal for the entire previous two meals
it<00:03:26.780> delayed<00:03:27.170> gastric<00:03:27.890> emptying<00:03:28.370> as<00:03:28.819> well<00:03:29.000> so

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
it delayed gastric emptying as well so

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.630 
it delayed gastric emptying as well so
feeding<00:03:30.950> him<00:03:31.099> was<00:03:31.720> pretty<00:03:32.720> tough

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
feeding him was pretty tough
