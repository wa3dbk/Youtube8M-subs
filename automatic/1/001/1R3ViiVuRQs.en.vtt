00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
excited about what's possible for forge

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.170 
excited about what's possible for forge
what<00:01:17.220> they're<00:01:17.400> going<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.640> do<00:01:17.759> with<00:01:17.880> forge

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
what they're going to do with forge

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.260 
what they're going to do with forge
because<00:01:18.540> relic<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:19.080> really<00:01:19.830> an<00:01:20.009> ideal<00:01:20.270> forge

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
because relic is really an ideal forge

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.570 
because relic is really an ideal forge
world<00:01:21.630> somewhat<00:01:22.259> like<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.590> little<00:01:22.950> island<00:01:23.189> and

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
world somewhat like a little island and

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.359 
world somewhat like a little island and
then<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.090> can<00:01:24.240> forge<00:01:24.509> out<00:01:24.750> as<00:01:24.930> far<00:01:25.290> or<00:01:25.650> as<00:01:26.130> in

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
then you can forge out as far or as in

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.359 
then you can forge out as far or as in
as<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:27.000> want<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:28.439> brings<00:01:28.829> up<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.159> lot<00:01:29.310> of

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
as you want and that brings up a lot of

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.420 
as you want and that brings up a lot of
possibilities<00:01:29.850> for<00:01:30.240> forging<00:01:30.630> but<00:01:31.100> we<00:01:32.100> see<00:01:32.280> the

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
possibilities for forging but we see the

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.609 
possibilities for forging but we see the
halo<00:01:32.759> ring<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.450> map<00:01:33.689> is<00:01:33.930> really<00:01:34.290> one<00:01:34.590> sided

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
halo ring the map is really one sided

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.980 
halo ring the map is really one sided
one<00:01:35.250> side<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:35.790> somewhat<00:01:36.240> bright<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.960> the

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
one side is somewhat bright and the

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.620 
one side is somewhat bright and the
other<00:01:37.619> side<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.040> see<00:01:38.220> this<00:01:38.340> gigantic<00:01:39.119> storm

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
other side you see this gigantic storm

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.530 
other side you see this gigantic storm
coming<00:01:40.079> in<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.860> it's<00:01:41.070> really<00:01:41.310> really<00:01:41.700> cool<00:01:41.939> the

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
coming in so it's really really cool the

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.510 
coming in so it's really really cool the
map<00:01:42.750> isn't<00:01:43.079> supposed<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.799> be<00:01:43.920> symmetrical

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520

it's<00:01:44.759> supposed<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.270> be<00:01:45.360> like<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.810> one<00:01:46.170> bomb<00:01:46.380> or

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
it's supposed to be like a one bomb or

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.760

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
one CTF kind of game so it brings up

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.010 
one CTF kind of game so it brings up
really<00:01:50.100> cool<00:01:50.310> possibilities<00:01:50.970> for<00:01:51.329> offense

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
really cool possibilities for offense
