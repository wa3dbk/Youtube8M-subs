00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.870
 we describe the events of 2 stories in which 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.720
 Garrosh was directly involved 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.550
 and begin to move slowly on his 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.550
 history in the events of the cataclysm 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:55.899
 while garrosh and bane could 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.149
 overcome their differences for the good of the horde 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:02.500
 new conflicts began to grow in 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:04.839
 times of split due to hard work 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.890
 goblins who used from the ball 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.409
 for military needs 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:12.490
 hordes there was a water supply gap 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:15.369
 orgrimmar garrosh discussed the possibility 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.250
 supply of water from Bulgar with bane 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:21.270
 their a mule it was a hard decision on 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.770
 the tauren agreed 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.140
 after that there was a conflict between 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:31.210
 taurine me is when images that 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.200
 attacked water supplies upon arrival 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.810
 in the thunder cliff 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.789
 Garrosh Meets Bane Bane 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:41.340
 proposed to resolve this issue by peaceful 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:43.750
 by but garrosh did not listen to him 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.409
 together with fifteen Crimean corr 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.240
 by wars 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.420
 Garrosh went to deal with this 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.369
 problem but was ambushed and turned out to be 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.920
 on the verge of life and death 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:58.660
 however bane and ham str with a little 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.840
 a detachment helped him Bane said that 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.819
 Hubble made a separate water source 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.610
 especially for sven images and what's more 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:08.800
 they will not attack them garrosh was 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.770
 confused because of this situation but despite 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.640
 on his concerns bane reaffirmed 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.940
 my loyalty 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.940
 or die 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.810
 shortly after the split, the garrosh personally led 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.000
 his troops to the borders of ashen vala though 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.010
 the clan of war songs has achieved significant 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.709
 success during the reign of trawl 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:34.450
 it was far away from those ambitions which 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:36.430
 set a garrosh before him he wanted 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.730
 create a huge city in the heart 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.970
 forests such that he would eclipse the strength and 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.220
 the size of the orgrimmar itself this region was 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.480
 rich in minerals and resources that 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.910
 could exalt 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.280
 horde and garrosh decided to break right 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:56.290
 through the night elf ranks and attack 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:58.690
 forpost with rib wings taking on the service 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.030
 tamed about dragons and hostages 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.720
 from the ranks of magna goods seized in 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.390
 northscale 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:09.340
 good expected to carry out his plans 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:12.819
 his attack on forpost led to 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.280
 the unconditional victory of the horde garrosh thought 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:18.069
 about how his father would become 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:22.510
 victim of ashen Valis troops praised him 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:25.000
 successes garrosh came to the conclusion that even 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.260
 trawl will not be able to ignore his prowess 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.019
 in military craft 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:33.819
 and make him a champion once and orcs and 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:36.069
 the whole horde for receiving information about 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.920
 upcoming talks between the leaders 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:43.690
 alliance he decided to strike to 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:46.480
 lure the tyrant soul sheet of wind like him and 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.269
 expected the priests arrived at the indicated place and 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:53.859
 horde released the might of magna tavr against 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:56.500
 alliance forces in the turmoil of tiranda was 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:59.319
 wounded by archers of orcs and confident 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.019
 the upcoming victory garrosh also burst 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:03.370
 to battle 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.590
 the battle was interrupted by the arrival 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.870
 reinforcements in orders under the leadership 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.269
 Variant Arina and Gennadogriva 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.049
 who were able to drop a few 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:13.049
 magna goods 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.590
 during the battle between boiled and good 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.360
 the king of the people took advantage over the orcs 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:25.370
 but wars core crown 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:27.950
 were able to separate the garrosh garrosh from the king 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:31.870
 unwittingly retreated promising the future 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.870
 kill the varian yourself 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.880
 during the split, the garrosh begins 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.940
 take a tougher stance on 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:43.190
 towards war with the alliance he sent 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.440
 his army to ravage the land ashen 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.970
 to get supplies that were 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:52.100
 his people really need 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:56.440
 the action of the garrosh made the people of the orcs 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:59.630
 ignore the hunger threatening that rotar 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:02.480
 Garrosh believed that if the blood is selfish 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:05.050
 Alliance need to give it 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:09.040
 people need the resources to survive 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.040
 mean so be it 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.640
 Garrosh climbing as leader 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.740
 was approved by the majority 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:18.380
 orcs who felt that his 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.570
 bold warrior instincts and no desire 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:23.210
 negotiate for the necessary 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:26.860
 resources more consistent with the true 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:29.630
 the image of a real orc 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.410
 good moved most of the representatives 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.140
 other races 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.610
 from the center of orgrimmar considering that only 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:37.940
 they can protect 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:40.550
 outskirts of the city despite the fact that the garage 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:43.070
 was a cruel ruler he continued 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.380
 see the value of each race and horde and 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:48.100
 best used them for 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:51.740
 your goals 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:54.620
 he later created a new army of militia 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:59.750
 city crane to deal with the problem 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:06:01.430
 centaurs nonetheless 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.650
 garrosh paid very little attention 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:06.200
 advice that expressed 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:08.420
 representatives of other races and never 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:11.240
 beat diplomatic relations with neither 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:14.260
 representatives of the alliance not even with 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.260
 members of the horde 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:20.500
 no longer trusting the other races of the horde garrosh 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:25.570
 understood that their leaders are much stronger than 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:28.050
 he assumed earlier garrosh entered into 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:31.390
 conflict with the leader of the black spear tribe 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:33.850
 Vol'gin his relationship with Vol'jin 

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:36.120
 worsened as rapidly as in 

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:39.690
 case with cairn 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:44.520
 in the end because of the peas thrust war 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:44.520
 Vol'jin began to threaten him 

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:50.590
 the consequence of this conflict was 

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:52.840
 mass care black spear trolls from 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:56.050
 orgrimmar led by embittered 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.800
 vol'jin this gap between arches and 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.480
 trolls 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:02.970
 strongly weakened never 

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.970
 concentrated military power of the horde 

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:15.810
 on this issue came to an end well and how 

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:17.910
 usually the fate of the garrosh we 

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:20.280
