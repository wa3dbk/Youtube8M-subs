crew on top of that and I don't have it
unlocked<00:01:16.880> yet<00:01:17.119> I<00:01:17.329> guess<00:01:17.539> to<00:01:17.840> do<00:01:18.109> the

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
unlocked yet I guess to do the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:19.989 
unlocked yet I guess to do the
secondaries<00:01:18.920> you<00:01:18.979> have<00:01:19.100> to<00:01:19.159> be<00:01:19.249> a<00:01:19.280> level<00:01:19.520> 10<00:01:19.850> in

00:01:19.989 --> 00:01:19.999 
secondaries you have to be a level 10 in

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:21.669 
secondaries you have to be a level 10 in
your<00:01:20.119> crew<00:01:20.359> so<00:01:20.630> keep<00:01:20.810> that<00:01:20.990> in<00:01:21.109> mind<00:01:21.319> as<00:01:21.469> well

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:21.679 
your crew so keep that in mind as well

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:23.139 
your crew so keep that in mind as well
and<00:01:22.009> then<00:01:22.249> for<00:01:22.460> the<00:01:22.549> rims<00:01:22.759> you're<00:01:22.939> going<00:01:23.090> to

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
and then for the rims you're going to

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:25.209 
and then for the rims you're going to
want<00:01:23.299> to<00:01:23.359> use<00:01:23.569> a<00:01:23.600> fluorescent<00:01:24.560> blue<00:01:24.890> and

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:25.219 
want to use a fluorescent blue and

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:27.160 
want to use a fluorescent blue and
that's<00:01:25.789> how<00:01:25.999> you<00:01:26.060> make<00:01:26.329> blue<00:01:26.600> steel<00:01:26.869> so

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
that's how you make blue steel so

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.870 
that's how you make blue steel so

this car

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.460 
this car
I<00:02:29.430> think<00:02:29.940> this<00:02:30.060> colorway<00:02:30.360> by<00:02:30.810> itself<00:02:31.200> just

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
I think this colorway by itself just

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.840 
I think this colorway by itself just
looks<00:02:31.620> it's<00:02:31.800> a<00:02:31.860> good<00:02:32.010> blend<00:02:32.160> of<00:02:32.400> colors<00:02:32.700> it

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
looks it's a good blend of colors it

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:33.920 
looks it's a good blend of colors it
looks<00:02:33.000> good<00:02:33.180> you<00:02:33.240> don't<00:02:33.420> really<00:02:33.600> need<00:02:33.780> the

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
looks good you don't really need the

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.690 
looks good you don't really need the
logo<00:02:34.260> I<00:02:34.470> think<00:02:34.920> when<00:02:35.040> people<00:02:35.070> see<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:35.550> they'll

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
logo I think when people see it they'll

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.880 
logo I think when people see it they'll
know<00:02:35.880> that<00:02:36.090> that's<00:02:36.270> Ironman<00:02:36.840> so<00:02:37.440> I<00:02:37.470> think<00:02:37.709> this

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
know that that's Ironman so I think this

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.080 
know that that's Ironman so I think this
is<00:02:37.950> really<00:02:38.130> cool<00:02:38.430> this<00:02:38.490> is<00:02:38.640> coming<00:02:38.910> in<00:02:39.000> number
