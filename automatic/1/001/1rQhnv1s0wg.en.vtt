out here or something it's a mono when
you're<00:00:55.079> interesting<00:00:55.440> like<00:00:55.590> this<00:00:55.860> there's

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
you're interesting like this there's

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.119 
you're interesting like this there's
actually<00:00:56.940> another<00:00:57.210> power<00:00:57.570> amplifier<00:00:58.129> that

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
actually another power amplifier that

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.590 
actually another power amplifier that
you<00:00:59.219> can<00:00:59.340> come<00:00:59.489> out<00:00:59.520> so<00:00:59.820> this<00:00:59.969> box<00:01:00.149> will<00:01:00.329> end<00:01:00.480> up

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
you can run actually two boxes over

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.950 
you can run actually two boxes over
there<00:01:08.280> and

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
there and

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.570

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
the line array and get more base

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.410 
the line array and get more base
coverage<00:01:12.880> everything<00:01:13.880> so<00:01:14.180> we're<00:01:14.299> pretty

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
we tilted the speakers because a lot of

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.300 
we tilted the speakers because a lot of
people<00:01:50.869> they<00:01:51.289> may<00:01:51.410> not<00:01:51.560> use<00:01:51.740> it<00:01:51.770> like<00:01:51.979> this<00:01:52.130> may

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
people they may not use it like this may

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.070 
people they may not use it like this may
actually<00:01:52.460> is<00:01:52.729> it<00:01:52.850> a<00:01:52.940> guitar<00:01:53.119> instrument<00:01:53.660> yeah

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
actually is it a guitar instrument yeah

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.639 
actually is it a guitar instrument yeah
something<00:01:54.380> like<00:01:54.410> that

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
something like that

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:56.770 
something like that
certainly<00:01:55.369> what<00:01:55.729> is<00:01:55.820> a<00:01:55.850> dispersion<00:01:56.270> L<00:01:56.509> when<00:01:56.690> it

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
certainly what is a dispersion L when it

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.480 
certainly what is a dispersion L when it
we<00:01:57.050> were<00:01:57.140> walking<00:01:57.320> around<00:01:57.530> they<00:01:57.770> were<00:01:57.830> talking

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
we were walking around they were talking

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.340 
we were walking around they were talking

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
into and it sounded incredible but it

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.109 
into and it sounded incredible but it
seemed<00:02:00.530> like<00:02:00.560> that<00:02:00.860> who<00:02:01.100> had<00:02:01.340> coverage<00:02:01.940> is

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
seemed like that who had coverage is

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:03.790 
seemed like that who had coverage is
very<00:02:02.360> very<00:02:02.509> wide<00:02:02.690> very<00:02:02.960> wide<00:02:03.229> you<00:02:03.530> get<00:02:03.679> about
