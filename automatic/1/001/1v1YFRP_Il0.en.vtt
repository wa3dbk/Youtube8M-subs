 but this picture is exactly familiar to you 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:49.160
 from the movie Jurassic Park saw 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:52.760
 head tyrannosaurus how terrible and these 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:56.440
 huge claws and such a long neck and this 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.820
 from another dinosaur this is from professor 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:03.830
 I see, you can put it together 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:06.290

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.570
 the toy has very small parts here 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.080
 it is said that you can only play with him 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:15.680
 if you are four years old 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:17.840
 what is on the back of the box here 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.429
 drawing shows us how to assemble 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:24.159
 dinosaur can use any parts 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:26.420
 can even join wings 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.960
 tyrannosaurus head velociraptors 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:36.789
 and add triceratops limb 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:36.789
 let's open to you we will get forecasts 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:48.090
 look here this part is oh so how not 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:50.820
 just build a dinosaur these set here 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:56.700
 here so we collect our indominus 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:02:09.869
 rex as we want here is our tyrannosaurus rex and 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:12.000
 ready when he lacks many more 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.489
 parts see how it opens 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.980
 jaw 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:20.040
 can wave his tail better not to him 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:24.989
 approach if we add to it these 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:30.269
 parts then it will become even worse as this 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:33.180
 claw it moves too now i'm for sure 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:36.470
 I'll put it right here, look perfect 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.470
 fits and another 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:47.700
 I think we got lame everything is not 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:51.020

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:56.490
 color does not fit let's check 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:59.250
 we can collect it as we want it 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:02.850

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:11.130

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:21.570
 red comb over here and our dinosaur 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.970
 get scared worse if 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:27.770
 add to it also the ridge will turn out with 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.770
 the place of your brother and the dragons 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:40.340
 now put another claw over here 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:43.630
 front truth we have turned 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:46.340
 eerily dinosaur 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.709
 let's take velociraptor to him now 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.920
 too lacking in many parts come 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:54.410
 collect them but we have so many parts 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.660
 spent collecting tyrannosaur I don't know 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.480
 Is it because we like velociraptor and 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.760
 his claws used let's set 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.060
 ridge 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:08.380
 bolshevat but he can scare 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:12.610
 enemies and tyrannosaurus rex 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.610
 add missing claws 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:19.820
 only have to change them 3 more 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:30.100
 fit tyrannosaurus like this change them 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:30.100
 buy in places falls off 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:36.250
 that's so great now claws 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.250
 velociraptor 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:43.930
 we put right here now he has 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.090
 both limbs on velociraptor they are very 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:52.180
 important because they help him quickly 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:05:02.440
 run now let's find him in front 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:05:05.620
 scare here he is now assembled oh he 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:09.160
 falls back ridge insert it here 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:12.160
 now he is ready to fight tyrannosaur 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.920
 be careful tyrannosaurus rex very 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.280
 is strong and velociraptor falls off 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.280
 ridge 

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:34.719
 can change his head and make of 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:39.389
 him a brachiosaurus velociraptor to me 

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:41.439
 really scary put does not wash my hair 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:46.539
 looks like the head of the Loch Ness monster 

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:48.249
 so after all here and now whether 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:51.399
 tyrannosaurus fight this new 

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:53.679
 dinosaur like a mixture 

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:55.860
 let go of cyclist and brachiosaurus 

00:05:53.679 --> 00:05:55.860
 check 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.159
 we will get thorns 

00:05:58.059 --> 00:06:02.949
 no other is better which is smaller 

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:07.739
 look see how he has changed like this 

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:11.050
 now the fight will be equal without a doubt 

00:06:07.739 --> 00:06:13.029
