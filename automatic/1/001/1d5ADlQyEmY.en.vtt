 champions today we have one of the top 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:10.250
 stronger leinders in the lane 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.719
 superior I mean ren hector and the 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.519
 crocodile has always been a selection 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.740
 solid both on stage 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.869
 competitive international 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:22.180
 qualifying games that's why 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.180
 today we will know all his secrets 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.410
 so as always we start with the 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.690
 most basic your skills your passive the 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.850
 kingdom of straight anger in general 5 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.040
 rage points with each basic attack and 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.710
 with some of his skills when the 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.360
 Fury of electrons is with 50 points or 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.950
 plus the skills of this one 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.380
 strengthen of acquire characteristics 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.559
 extras when rené contains less than the 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.540
 half of your life generates 50% more fury 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.330
 fast is passive increases healing 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.580
 of your cv the stun of tw and the damage 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.500
 of your ex the passive of rené with you must 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.450
 learn to master it you should always 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.580
 fight when you have more than half of 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.920
 Anger is something like dominating the passive 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.930
 rumble and it will give you a lot of extra damage 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.479
 to win the clashes in the 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.310
 lane let's continue with the q sacrifice to the 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.259
 weak run hector takes a spin with his 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.759
 sword inflicting physical damage to all 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.950
 the enemies that are at your 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.290
 around generating 5 points of fury 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.149
 for each enemy hit and healing a 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.850
 percentage of damage done to a 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:29.399
 maximum of 20% when this damage has been 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.440
 applied to champions and 5% when the 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:33.240
 damage is applied to subjects 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.039
 this is the basic skill of your convoy 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.060
 allows you to make a top liner with a lot 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.009
 damage and a good scare 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.079
 to hold a lot of time in the lane 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.090
 superior earning gold and experience 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.979
 we continue with the predatory w 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.750
 implacable this skill is pretty 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.119
 simple causes your next attack 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.560
 basic is enhanced and also stuns 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.360
 the goal for a brief period of 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.729
 time the next skill is the 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.770
 is cut and cut straight is thrown 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.119
 quickly in one direction inflicting 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.369
 Physical damage to all enemies 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.229
 if it manages to hit pierced one 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.789
 objective with the first activation of 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.829
 this skill gets a second 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.020
 activation to jump back towards 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.640
 another place inflicting also damage 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.410
 physical and finally we have your 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.239
 definitive real dominus then 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.730
 It strengthens with dark energies during 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.830
 15 seconds increasing its size and 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.959
 increasing your life maximum while 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.819
 this reptile this transformed infringes 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.860
 magical damage to all enemies to your 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.810
 around and also generates 5 points of 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.370
 fury for every second is final 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.230
 it's like a second life since you 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.030
 allows you to survive much longer in the 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.620
 Team battles inflict damage to 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.299
 all the enemies that surround you 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.580
 we continue with the spells of 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:37.410
 Summoner in 100% of cases must 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.330
 be with flash independent of that 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.959
 rené contains an escape included which is 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.910
 the e 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.840
 they still depend a lot on the flash for 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.670
 survive 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.530
 or just to get to the 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.239
 enemy shooter to kill him and to 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.069
 accompany the flash in most 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.349
 the cases you will take teleportation 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.090
 to have a global presence inside 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.349
 of the game but in certain cases it is 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.180
 viable you carry ignition 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:59.010
 especially against rivals who have 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.379
 powerful regeneration of life as 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.209
 doctor world sway in masters the best 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.400
 option with reggaeton is to enhance your 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.930
 defenses since with your passive and damage 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.269
 of your skills have an excellent 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.160
 base damage in the game early so 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.650
 which the most viable thing is with running tom go 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.780
 with a 921 with focus on armor and 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.790
 life to be very firm in the phase of 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.380
 lines in runas the most used with 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.060
 reflector and otherwise the ones that I 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.980
 I recommend are resistance glyphs 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.870
 magical armor seals on brands of 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.640
 armor penetration the order of 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.769
 skills that powers with run hector 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.360
 is the next you start with with level 1 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.970
 for that damage in area and that can be 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.739
 apply to several goals then the wss 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.450
 it will help you a lot to win all three of 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.579
 harm especially if your opponent wants 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.590
 fight at the low levels and finally 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.629
 and for the escape and damage after 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.970
 this maximizes scu followed by the e for 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:47.040
 finally leave the w without forgetting to give a 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.810
 point in your definitive in levels 6 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.670
 11 and 16 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.530
 now and as is characteristic of the channel 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.690
 let's talk about your purchases in the phase of 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.280
 line your main with 3 root malware 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.349
 that does not have all the tools to 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.330
 wear out and keep you controlled what 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:02.099
 same happens with vladimiro to wear you 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.930
 a lot when you try to answer the damage 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:06.180
 will throw your puddle and leave you looking at the 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.040
 heaven asking for explanations of what happened 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.080
 here but there is a little trick to 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.209
 at least have an advantage against 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.580
 these champions both characters are very 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.980
 weak before level 4 happens they are very 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.810
 high and you can easily beat them like this 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.850
 that before they reach level 5 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.680
 go to kill them or call your jungle 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.660
 for a small champion this will give you a 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.060
 important help and an advantage in this 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.160
 so complex line phase now let's continue 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.200
 with the items at this point the logic 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.330
 more viable are two damage items and three 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.040
 objects of resistance this gives you some 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.169
 balanced statistics to be able 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.450
 fight against your rivals resist a lot 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:41.340
 and otherwise perform a good damage 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.410
 to essentially eliminate the 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.120
 enemy lanes so to begin 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.580
 The most reliable phase of the line is a 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.680
 shield of dhoran fusion and added to this 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.660
 the trinket of vision this added to your 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.190
 they cultivated sustain to survive all 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.230
 the phases of lines remember that you 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.030
 definitive added to your 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.980
 a very difficult character to kill 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.050
 take advantage of this to take advantage and 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.970
 put constant pressure on your enemy 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.770
 after this you must choose your first 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.750
 item of damage the most viable is a hydra 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.670
 or the new blade allegra after 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.470
 this you start to tank and here I leave you 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.420
 all viable options with remington 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.370
 but as I always tell you, remember that 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.140
 all situational utilization and 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.360
 buy your objects by passing 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.430
 needs of your team and the game 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.560
 finally we come to the most important 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.060
 of the mechanical guide and role of the champion 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.250
 The first thing you should know is that 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.960
 send shines on one on one 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.790
 especially against champions who 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.470
 they depend a lot on impacting attacks 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.090
 basic to inflict damage 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.340
 this happens first because you are a 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.900
 tank and your victimization is with you 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.520
 generally to the champions who 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.440
 like to impact basic attacks them 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.900
 complicate those who build many 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.090
 resistors and second your combo this is 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.740
 an application makes you practically 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.720
 untouchable is clean damage and I'm going to 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.790
 teach how to use it to get everything out 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.890
 the possible benefit first you must load 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.960
 your rage bar over 50 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:57.390
 a hundred then when you have your objective spears 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.580
 lae towards him when you get to use it wy 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:01.440
 you give him a basic attack then the cv and 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.120
 you come out again with the reset of the 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.950
 due to predator control 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.780
 implacable the enemy does not reach 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:09.300
 react and you do a good damage 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:12.090
 without receiving anything against repeat this 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:15.030
 many times in the ew line phase 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.920
 basic q is to reach a point where this 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.960
 it will come out as breathing and always 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.580
 will apply this clean damage and I assure you 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.310
 that will help you win more than ever 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.410
 heading another tip to improve in the 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.480
 phase of lines is to lose subjects and 

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.890
 with straight is not so complex low the 

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.350
 life of the subjects with your attacks 

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:33.390
 basic and finish them all together with 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:35.340
 the cv in fact if you build the hydra and 

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:37.050
 the solar fire layer the waves of 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.700
 minions the pharmacies- very fast and 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:41.010
 you will have constant and sonante gold 

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:42.510
 earning an experience advantage 

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.550
 about your rival as I told you at the beginning 

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:46.320
 reelecto is not a very difficult character 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.210
 to eliminate and also a very character 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.130
 hard to win in fact if he played in 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:52.530
 enemy to Paris at your back uses 

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:54.060
 you is about him and the reset launches 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:55.740
 another immediately to put yourself 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.330
 shelter in your tower now talking about 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.100
 the battles of equipment your role vary 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.900
 three functions the first one that starts 

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.820
 Usually if your team does not have another 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.650
 initiator that responsibility will fall 

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:06.960
 mind they always start with your e 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:07.830
 applying the w one of the cars to 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.470
 then launch your 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:12.090
 to apply harm to anyone in time 

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:13.830
 another function that will be required of you in the 

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:15.690
 Team battles is to eliminate the 

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:18.300
 enemy shooter for that have many 

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:20.160
 Flash tools as well as I that 

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.230
 you will have enough damage to fight 

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.760
 against him and applied was double and those 

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:25.950
 prescribe I stopped you for the shooters 

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.900
 enemies it 's very difficult to take away a 

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:29.580
 reelecto takes advantage of that to win the 

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.260
 team battles and finally the 

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:32.910
 last function that you can fulfill in the 

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.950
 team battles is to dream your 

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:36.960
 rivals I explain many times 

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:38.820
 relection is built so tank that no 

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.800
 you can kill that one but what does 

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:42.270
 you can do is take it out of the battle of 

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:45.090
 teams take her fight a one against 

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:47.430
 one against you leaving your team without this 

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:48.630
 annoyance of having an enemy shooter and 

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:51.060
 if you can take two objectives 

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:53.100
 better this puts pressure on your team already 

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:54.690
 that you leave them fighting in a 4 versus 3 

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.800
 what is undoubtedly an advantage 

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:57.240
 important 

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.560
 good invoker is this is all for the 

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.660
