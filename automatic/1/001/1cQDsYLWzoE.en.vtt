flexible<00:01:07.799> case<00:01:08.010> it's<00:01:08.490> made<00:01:08.640> from<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.939> high

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
flexible case it's made from a high

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.660 
flexible case it's made from a high
quality<00:01:09.270> material<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.350> it's<00:01:11.010> kind<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.400> mix

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
quality material and it's kind of a mix

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.880 
quality material and it's kind of a mix
between<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:12.090> hard<00:01:12.450> case<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:13.080> soft<00:01:13.380> silicone

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.380 
between a hard case and a soft silicone
case<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.340> it's<00:01:14.490> kind<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.700> in<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.850> middle<00:01:15.030> and

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
case so it's kind of in the middle and

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.859 
case so it's kind of in the middle and
it<00:01:16.020> really<00:01:16.530> does<00:01:16.890> feel<00:01:16.920> really<00:01:17.790> good<00:01:18.509> quality

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
it really does feel really good quality

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.859 
it really does feel really good quality
and<00:01:19.820> the<00:01:20.820> design<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.299> really<00:01:21.330> good<00:01:21.720> as<00:01:21.840> well

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
and the design is really good as well

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.800 
and the design is really good as well
and<00:01:22.740> it's<00:01:23.130> not<00:01:23.310> too<00:01:23.549> thick<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.119> it's<00:01:24.540> not<00:01:24.659> too

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
and it's not too thick and it's not too

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.070

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
case protects all four corners so you

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.310 
case protects all four corners so you
don't<00:04:08.070> have<00:04:08.130> to<00:04:08.250> worry<00:04:08.400> about<00:04:08.519> it<00:04:08.850> like<00:04:09.320> when

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
don't have to worry about it like when

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.590 
don't have to worry about it like when
you<00:04:10.350> drop<00:04:10.650> it<00:04:10.830> will<00:04:11.760> protect<00:04:11.970> all<00:04:12.360> four

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
you drop it will protect all four

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.360 
you drop it will protect all four
corners<00:04:12.840> even<00:04:13.440> if<00:04:13.680> you<00:04:13.769> drop<00:04:13.920> it<00:04:14.070> face<00:04:14.340> down

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
corners even if you drop it face down

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.430 
corners even if you drop it face down
like<00:04:14.760> that<00:04:14.940> it<00:04:15.480> will<00:04:15.600> still<00:04:15.900> protect<00:04:16.080> the

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
like that it will still protect the

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.640 
like that it will still protect the
front<00:04:16.769> of<00:04:16.859> the<00:04:16.950> screen<00:04:17.160> that's<00:04:17.549> because<00:04:17.910> the

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
front of the screen that's because the

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.170 
front of the screen that's because the
edges<00:04:19.650> are<00:04:19.680> slightly<00:04:20.160> raised<00:04:20.520> so<00:04:20.849> you<00:04:20.910> could

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
edges are slightly raised so you could

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.850 
edges are slightly raised so you could
have<00:04:21.330> it<00:04:21.479> like<00:04:21.660> face<00:04:21.989> down<00:04:22.260> you<00:04:22.410> could<00:04:22.560> move<00:04:22.740> it

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
have it like face down you could move it

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:23.990 
have it like face down you could move it
about<00:04:22.950> and<00:04:23.310> you<00:04:23.370> don't<00:04:23.520> have<00:04:23.610> to<00:04:23.729> worry<00:04:23.880> about

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
about and you don't have to worry about

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.629 
about and you don't have to worry about
it

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
it

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.670 
it
scratching<00:04:24.939> a<00:04:25.030> screen<00:04:25.330> and<00:04:25.539> the<00:04:26.469> same<00:04:26.650> goes

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
scratching a screen and the same goes

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.129 
scratching a screen and the same goes
for<00:04:26.979> the<00:04:27.069> camera<00:04:27.490> it<00:04:27.729> was<00:04:27.999> slightly<00:04:28.419> raised<00:04:28.810> as

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
for the camera it was slightly raised as

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:30.779 
for the camera it was slightly raised as
well<00:04:29.349> so<00:04:29.650> don't<00:04:30.310> have<00:04:30.460> to<00:04:30.550> worry<00:04:30.699> about

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:30.789 
well so don't have to worry about

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:33.869 
well so don't have to worry about
skipping<00:04:31.360> scratches<00:04:32.289> on<00:04:32.439> your<00:04:32.520> camera<00:04:33.520> why<00:04:33.819> do

00:04:33.869 --> 00:04:33.879 
skipping scratches on your camera why do

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:37.409 
skipping scratches on your camera why do
you<00:04:33.969> have<00:04:34.090> it<00:04:34.120> face<00:04:34.419> down<00:04:34.449> or<00:04:34.900> like<00:04:35.379> this<00:04:36.419> and

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
you have it face down or like this and

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:38.969 
you have it face down or like this and
then<00:04:37.599> the<00:04:37.719> case<00:04:37.840> of<00:04:38.020> stuff<00:04:38.229> would<00:04:38.469> be<00:04:38.499> able<00:04:38.860> to

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
then the case of stuff would be able to

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:42.899 
then the case of stuff would be able to
survive<00:04:39.969> a<00:04:40.029> few<00:04:40.599> drops<00:04:40.870> and<00:04:41.639> just<00:04:42.639> be<00:04:42.729> able<00:04:42.759> to

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:42.909 
survive a few drops and just be able to

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:44.249 
survive a few drops and just be able to
drop<00:04:43.120> out<00:04:43.270> on<00:04:43.389> the<00:04:43.479> floor<00:04:43.629> and<00:04:43.749> I<00:04:43.810> think<00:04:44.050> the

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:44.259 
drop out on the floor and I think the

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:47.399 
drop out on the floor and I think the
the<00:04:45.009> case<00:04:45.490> itself<00:04:46.060> is<00:04:46.240> more<00:04:46.419> than<00:04:46.569> capable<00:04:47.020> of

00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:47.409 
the case itself is more than capable of

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:49.619 
the case itself is more than capable of
protecting<00:04:47.590> a<00:04:47.919> form<00:04:48.189> from<00:04:48.400> normal<00:04:49.330> everyday

00:04:49.619 --> 00:04:49.629 
protecting a form from normal everyday

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:51.980 
protecting a form from normal everyday
drops<00:04:50.379> and<00:04:50.680> bumps<00:04:50.740> and<00:04:51.370> stuff<00:04:51.490> like<00:04:51.759> that

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
drops and bumps and stuff like that

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.450 
drops and bumps and stuff like that
overall<00:04:52.990> it's<00:04:53.229> a<00:04:53.319> great<00:04:53.349> case<00:04:53.800> of<00:04:54.009> a<00:04:54.159> great

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
overall it's a great case of a great

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.700 
overall it's a great case of a great
design<00:04:54.849> and<00:04:55.180> I<00:04:55.599> really<00:04:55.840> do<00:04:55.990> like<00:04:56.139> the<00:04:56.319> amount

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
design and I really do like the amount

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.439 
design and I really do like the amount
of<00:04:56.740> protection<00:04:56.949> that<00:04:57.279> this<00:04:57.520> case<00:04:57.759> offers<00:04:58.029> and

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:58.449 
of protection that this case offers and

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:00.059 
of protection that this case offers and
the<00:04:58.840> variety<00:04:59.139> of<00:04:59.289> different<00:04:59.500> colors<00:04:59.949> you

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:00.069 
the variety of different colors you

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:02.040 
the variety of different colors you
could<00:05:00.219> get<00:05:00.370> it<00:05:00.490> in<00:05:00.610> and<00:05:00.819> I<00:05:01.210> think<00:05:01.270> it's<00:05:01.569> well

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
could get it in and I think it's well

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.600 
could get it in and I think it's well
worth<00:05:02.259> the<00:05:02.349> money<00:05:02.560> for<00:05:02.830> the<00:05:02.889> price<00:05:03.099> it's<00:05:03.370> only

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
worth the money for the price it's only

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.360 
worth the money for the price it's only
sixteen<00:05:04.180> dollars<00:05:04.449> 99<00:05:04.870> on<00:05:05.199> the<00:05:05.229> https<00:05:05.889> website
