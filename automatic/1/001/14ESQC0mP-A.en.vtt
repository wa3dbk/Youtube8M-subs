 I'm breaking this and putting it out in a cafe, but sometimes the flavor of t please 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.150
 I can tell you 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:26.890
 I don't feel like am t 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:32.500
 That 's why that theory was chosen St is the flavor of cocktails 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:34.490
 Expressed the taste like kocha ice tea without using any tea 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:41.120
 It is the flavor of the cocktail 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:43.379

 By the way but this is a camp 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:59.700
 Like this 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.700
 It contains the color bag of 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:07.810
 I like this Laver 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:11.770
 I think that the Roman flavor is a little less at b 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:18.730
 But quite it's perfectly there is also a 50 g When measured this 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:22.240
 Since it is fine and dense, it's a student, so just loosen it by 9 and loosen it carefully. 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.600
 At all and I'll think fluffy raised 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:29.860
 People are changing in Asia 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.860

 I think that I want to grinded 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:49.840
 It is good 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:56.859
 Good quality of the smoke is also very good I work well 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:57.340
 Smooth taste can be made The taste and smell is still close to the smell of cola 

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:03.340
 Ne 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:07.360
