00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:11.740
 new video from a pretty sloppy tweet 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.930
 useful and very very good 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.600
 it is a barrier which is going to 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.220
 get the effects when moving the 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.250

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.670

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.650
 packages once finished reloading 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.189

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.189

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:42.480

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.190
 device or springboard we press that 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:09.490
