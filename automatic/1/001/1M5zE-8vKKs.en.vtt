00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
and I then here is where I've automated

it's<00:02:53.640> actually<00:02:54.360> better<00:02:55.049> it's<00:02:55.530> just<00:02:55.709> that<00:02:55.860> I

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
it's actually better it's just that I

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.490 
it's actually better it's just that I
wasn't<00:02:56.099> producing<00:02:56.549> that<00:02:57.120> much<00:02:57.360> others<00:02:57.799> and

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
wasn't producing that much others and

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.589 
wasn't producing that much others and
everyone<00:03:01.500> knows<00:03:01.620> happening<00:03:02.069> tonight<00:03:02.430> I<00:03:05.599> think

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
everyone knows happening tonight I think

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.089 
everyone knows happening tonight I think
it's<00:03:06.750> getting<00:03:06.870> confused<00:03:07.410> with<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.769> different

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
it's getting confused with the different

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.479 
it's getting confused with the different
type<00:03:08.220> of<00:03:08.250> saplings<00:03:09.920> so<00:03:10.920> you'll<00:03:11.099> have<00:03:11.190> to<00:03:11.370> watch

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
type of saplings so you'll have to watch

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:17.930 
type of saplings so you'll have to watch
out<00:03:11.760> for<00:03:11.790> that

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:24.710 

so<00:03:18.570> after<00:03:18.750> you<00:03:19.340> follow<00:03:20.340> up<00:03:22.040> so<00:03:23.720> precision

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
so after you follow up so precision

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.590 
so after you follow up so precision
exports<00:03:25.410> gives<00:03:26.250> it<00:03:26.400> a<00:03:26.430> little<00:03:26.580> filter<00:03:26.940> options

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
exports gives it a little filter options

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.360 
exports gives it a little filter options
here<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:28.020> this<00:03:28.260> is<00:03:28.410> just<00:03:28.440> moving<00:03:28.800> by<00:03:29.070> stacks

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
here and this is just moving by stacks

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.670 
here and this is just moving by stacks
and<00:03:32.120> when<00:03:33.120> i<00:03:33.150> use<00:03:33.390> apple<00:03:33.840> juice<00:03:34.020> it's<00:03:34.290> actually

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
and when i use apple juice it's actually

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.850 
and when i use apple juice it's actually
better<00:03:35.040> than<00:03:35.190> using<00:03:35.610> water<00:03:36.500> equal<00:03:37.500> to<00:03:37.650> use

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
better than using water equal to use

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.650 
better than using water equal to use
water<00:03:38.130> equal<00:03:38.460> just<00:03:38.640> use<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:39.090> excuse<00:03:39.330> time

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
water equal just use the excuse time

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.360 
water equal just use the excuse time
night<00:03:39.900> accumulator<00:03:40.710> down<00:03:40.920> there<00:03:41.130> to<00:03:41.250> produce

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
night accumulator down there to produce

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.340 
night accumulator down there to produce
water<00:03:41.750> but<00:03:42.750> this<00:03:42.840> is<00:03:43.080> better<00:03:44.070> the<00:03:45.110> when<00:03:46.110> use

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
water but this is better the when use

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.380 
water but this is better the when use
fruit<00:03:46.800> juice<00:03:47.010> to<00:03:47.250> get<00:03:47.400> like<00:03:47.670> one<00:03:48.000> and<00:03:48.240> a<00:03:48.360> half

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
fruit juice to get like one and a half

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.920 
fruit juice to get like one and a half
times<00:03:48.570> better<00:03:49.170> than<00:03:49.260> water<00:03:50.210> and<00:03:51.210> if<00:03:51.660> you<00:03:51.810> use

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
times better than water and if you use

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.470 
times better than water and if you use
mulch<00:03:52.440> it<00:03:52.770> is<00:03:53.390> we'll<00:03:54.390> use<00:03:54.540> em<00:03:56.150> sorry<00:03:57.150> when<00:03:57.360> you

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
mulch it is we'll use em sorry when you

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.690 
mulch it is we'll use em sorry when you
fart<00:03:57.750> laser<00:03:58.050> you<00:03:58.260> get<00:03:58.470> out<00:03:58.680> a<00:03:58.830> full<00:03:59.100> cycle<00:03:59.370> of<00:03:59.610> a

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
fart laser you get out a full cycle of a

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.660 
fart laser you get out a full cycle of a
stack<00:04:00.050> I'll<00:04:01.050> get<00:04:01.700> 11.2<00:04:02.700> buckets<00:04:03.180> worth<00:04:03.540> of

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
stack I'll get 11.2 buckets worth of

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:13.600 
stack I'll get 11.2 buckets worth of
biomass<00:04:06.590> have<00:04:07.590> to<00:04:07.800> hear<00:04:08.040> to<00:04:08.160> keep<00:04:08.340> runnin<00:04:09.300> and

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.449 

yeah<00:04:14.610> so<00:04:14.910> if<00:04:15.060> i<00:04:15.180> use<00:04:15.330> mulch<00:04:15.750> I'll<00:04:15.990> get<00:04:16.459> 12,000

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
yeah so if i use mulch I'll get 12,000

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.870 
yeah so if i use mulch I'll get 12,000
many<00:04:17.970> buckets<00:04:18.330> with<00:04:18.510> just<00:04:18.690> 12<00:04:18.930> pockets<00:04:19.880> both

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
many buckets with just 12 pockets both

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.050 
many buckets with just 12 pockets both
are<00:04:21.120> not<00:04:21.269> producing<00:04:21.630> enough<00:04:21.840> apples<00:04:23.060> that

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
are not producing enough apples that

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.470 
are not producing enough apples that
might<00:04:24.240> be<00:04:24.270> it<00:04:25.520> could<00:04:26.520> always<00:04:26.820> change<00:04:27.030> it<00:04:27.270> down

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
might be it could always change it down

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.000 
might be it could always change it down
here<00:04:27.720> i<00:04:27.750> have<00:04:29.990> so<00:04:30.990> i<00:04:31.050> have<00:04:31.260> all<00:04:31.440> apple<00:04:31.860> juice

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
here i have so i have all apple juice

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.760 
here i have so i have all apple juice
come<00:04:32.220> down<00:04:32.400> or<00:04:32.610> skull<00:04:33.060> fruit<00:04:33.330> juice<00:04:33.540> and<00:04:34.380> then

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
come down or skull fruit juice and then

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:43.330 
come down or skull fruit juice and then
it's<00:04:35.190> going<00:04:35.400> in<00:04:35.580> here<00:04:39.860> indeed<00:04:40.860> your<00:04:41.040> side<00:04:41.280> here

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
it's going in here indeed your side here

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:49.850 
it's going in here indeed your side here
stay<00:04:44.340> the<00:04:44.400> water<00:04:44.700> so<00:04:47.240> yeah<00:04:48.440> fertilizer<00:04:49.440> so

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
stay the water so yeah fertilizer so

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.640 
stay the water so yeah fertilizer so
that's<00:04:50.580> pretty<00:04:50.880> much<00:04:51.000> it<00:04:51.320> and<00:04:52.320> then<00:04:52.440> i<00:04:52.590> just

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
that's pretty much it and then i just

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.560 
that's pretty much it and then i just
have<00:04:52.860> everything<00:04:53.190> going<00:04:53.340> down<00:04:53.790> along<00:04:54.300> here

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
have everything going down along here

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.760 
have everything going down along here
into<00:04:54.810> this<00:04:55.350> tank<00:04:55.680> just<00:04:56.520> biomass<00:04:57.320> but<00:04:58.320> then<00:04:58.530> i

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
into this tank just biomass but then i

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.590 
into this tank just biomass but then i
could<00:04:59.130> have<00:04:59.340> like<00:04:59.730> liquid<00:05:00.150> lipstick<00:05:00.450> on<00:05:00.570> it

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
could have like liquid lipstick on it

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:06.010 
could have like liquid lipstick on it
stills<00:05:01.440> and<00:05:02.060> then<00:05:03.060> into<00:05:03.360> a<00:05:03.390> boiler<00:05:03.810> whatever
