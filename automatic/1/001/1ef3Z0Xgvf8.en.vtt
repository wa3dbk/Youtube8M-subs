get the wine but this is made in a
crystal<00:00:36.870> bottle<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.800> legend<00:00:38.430> was

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
crystal bottle and the the legend was

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.459 
crystal bottle and the the legend was
something<00:00:39.420> along<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.750> lines<00:00:39.930> that<00:00:40.200> this<00:00:40.290> was

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
something along the lines that this was

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.650 
something along the lines that this was
Napoleon's<00:00:40.980> favorite<00:00:41.340> champagne<00:00:41.790> he<00:00:42.540> was

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
Napoleon's favorite champagne he was

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.150 
Napoleon's favorite champagne he was
afraid<00:00:42.870> someone<00:00:43.290> was<00:00:43.379> going<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.620> poison<00:00:43.829> him

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
afraid someone was going to poison him

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.069 
afraid someone was going to poison him
so<00:00:44.520> he<00:00:45.030> had<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.300> made<00:00:45.420> in<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.570> crystal<00:00:45.930> bottle

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
so he had it made in the crystal bottle

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.420 
so he had it made in the crystal bottle
so<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.410> would<00:00:46.500> be<00:00:46.559> easier<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.039> see<00:00:47.190> if<00:00:47.280> there

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
so it would be easier to see if there

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.580 
so it would be easier to see if there
were<00:00:47.520> any<00:00:47.550> impurities<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.050> bottles

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
were any impurities in in the bottles

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.040 
were any impurities in in the bottles
but<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.219> think<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.640> truer<00:00:51.030> story<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.809> he

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
but I think the truer story is that he

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.260 
but I think the truer story is that he
was<00:00:52.170> having<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.500> shipped<00:00:52.680> all<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:52.980> way<00:00:53.070> from

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
was having it shipped all the way from

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.720 
was having it shipped all the way from
Russia<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.780> shipped<00:00:55.620> into<00:00:56.070> Russia<00:00:56.250> as<00:00:56.460> he<00:00:56.610> was

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
Russia and shipped into Russia as he was

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.849 
Russia and shipped into Russia as he was
trying<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:56.969> conquer<00:00:57.329> them<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.870> falling<00:00:58.770> back

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
trying to conquer them and falling back

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.139 
trying to conquer them and falling back
and<00:00:59.070> still<00:00:59.219> drinking<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.550> lot<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.760> champagne<00:01:00.090> I

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
and still drinking a lot of champagne I

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.549 
and still drinking a lot of champagne I
think<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.510> celebrate<00:01:00.899> in<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.020> beginning<00:01:01.379> and

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
think to celebrate in the beginning and

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.560 
think to celebrate in the beginning and
