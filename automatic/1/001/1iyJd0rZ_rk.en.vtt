bit<00:00:24.119> hard<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.359> follow<00:00:24.570> so<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:25.230> sped<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.250> up<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.490> an

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
bit hard to follow so I sped it up to an

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.920 
bit hard to follow so I sped it up to an
even<00:00:26.670> five<00:00:27.000> minutes<00:00:27.210> for<00:00:27.420> you<00:00:27.539> guys<00:00:27.689> so

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
hopefully it's not too bad I

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
hopefully it's not too bad I
particularly<00:00:30.150> avani<00:00:30.449> thinking<00:00:30.869> that's<00:00:31.019> going

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
particularly avani thinking that's going

to<00:00:31.230> use<00:00:31.320> heat<00:00:31.500> wave<00:00:31.969> drag<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.360> uses<00:00:33.780> what's<00:00:34.590> it

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
to use heat wave drag it uses what's it

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.310 
to use heat wave drag it uses what's it
the<00:00:35.489> hydreigon<00:00:36.120> uses<00:00:36.570> dragon<00:00:36.870> wash<00:00:36.989> which<00:00:37.200> I

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
the hydreigon uses dragon wash which I

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.490 
the hydreigon uses dragon wash which I
did<00:00:37.530> not<00:00:37.559> expect<00:00:37.800> as<00:00:38.309> most<00:00:38.899> hi<00:00:39.899> dragons<00:00:40.350> are

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
did not expect as most hi dragons are

um<00:00:45.110> metagross<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.289> don't<00:00:46.410> know<00:00:46.500> why<00:00:46.739> used

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
um metagross I don't know why used

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.520 
um metagross I don't know why used
earthquake<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:48.030> be<00:00:48.149> honest<00:00:48.390> maybe<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.379> to

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
earthquake to be honest maybe it is to

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.869 
earthquake to be honest maybe it is to
get<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.680> bit<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:49.890> damage<00:00:50.129> on<00:00:50.430> everything

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
get a bit of damage on everything

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.209 
get a bit of damage on everything
because<00:00:51.300> Charizard<00:00:52.079> indeed<00:00:52.379> does<00:00:52.649> use<00:00:52.920> heat

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219

was meant to use Thunder Wave on the
high<00:01:01.710> drag<00:01:01.980> on<00:01:02.160> because<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:02.910> knew<00:01:03.090> their<00:01:03.210> life

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
high drag on because I knew their life

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.750 
beam as micro kernel is heavy training
special<00:02:19.490> attack<00:02:21.010> I'm<00:02:22.010> surprised<00:02:22.460> he<00:02:22.580> didn't

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
special attack I'm surprised he didn't

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.310 
special attack I'm surprised he didn't
go<00:02:22.790> for<00:02:22.910> another<00:02:23.180> meteor<00:02:23.690> mash<00:02:23.900> is<00:02:24.050> something

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
go for another meteor mash is something

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.280 
go for another meteor mash is something
like<00:02:24.440> that<00:02:24.590> knowing<00:02:24.800> he<00:02:24.980> was<00:02:25.100> faster<00:02:26.230> on<00:02:27.230> my

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
like that knowing he was faster on my

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.900 
like that knowing he was faster on my
stat<00:02:27.830> line<00:02:27.980> but<00:02:28.130> I<00:02:28.160> guess<00:02:28.340> he<00:02:28.370> wanted<00:02:28.670> to<00:02:28.790> do

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
stat line but I guess he wanted to do

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.500 
stat line but I guess he wanted to do
some<00:02:29.300> damage<00:02:29.480> to<00:02:29.630> gelatin<00:02:30.080> at<00:02:30.350> the<00:02:30.470> same<00:02:30.680> time

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
some damage to gelatin at the same time

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.000 
some damage to gelatin at the same time
so<00:02:32.510> Paul<00:02:32.720> Krager<00:02:32.960> no<00:02:33.170> doesn't<00:02:33.530> even<00:02:33.620> take<00:02:33.830> out

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
so Paul Krager no doesn't even take out

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.310 
so Paul Krager no doesn't even take out
