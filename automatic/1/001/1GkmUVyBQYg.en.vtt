00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
If voytech sell E-50, he can buy Cromwell and AT 8...

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Additionally... credits for T30 and SU-122-54 ...

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
...are enough for one tier VIII with modules and the training of the crew.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
But it takes months to finish and sell these tiers IX.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
What the fuck are you talking about? voytech wins a tier VIII money maker. Or even two. Problem solved!

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Mein Fuhrer ... WG announced the results of Catwalk Contest...

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
voytech won nothing.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
They promised him only a consolation prize.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Anyone who has in the garage tier VIII premium tank - get the fuck out.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
That's ubelieveable! That is fucked up!

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
voytech put in these videos to the contest a lot of effort!

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
He invested more time and money, both their own and friends ...

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
... than those shit tanks are worth!

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
He had a superb ideas and great performance!

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And the director's versions!

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Mein Fuhrer, the other participants also did well...

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
What the fuck did they well?!

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
They created a video, sent to the contest ...

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
They more try in the toilet, shitting on Sunday morning!

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
For fuck's sake!

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
They moved a bit in front of their mobile phone's photo camera...

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
with no idea, no balls, no interest or surprise the viewer,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
the movie's chewing gum, as the current TV series.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And acting? What fucking acting?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
After all, there can't be so handicapped or gay, as seen in the movies!

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
voytech is very dedicated to this game.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I read his Ultimate Guide, watch his YT channel, even I learned something.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
voytech still buys new tanks, just to describe them in the Guide.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
To the other players know from a reliable source, is it worth it to go a particular way.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
He has no premium account, no money maker. And he has NO SUPPORT from Wargaming.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Not only that, WG hates him for pointing out the errors and his big mouth.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Do not cry. They promised voytech a consolation prize.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Yet another fucked up contest in which WG is ridiculed.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Again won the bad movies, and in addition against the rules of the competition.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And the results... it was a political decision to punish voytech.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
voytech has no more credits for the continuation of the Guide.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
He can't afford it, not just tier X tanks, but even to buy a tier VI.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
This Contest had once and for all solve the problems with the credits.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Does this mean the end of the Guide?
