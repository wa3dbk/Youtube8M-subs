it will envelop Mars inside of its coma

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.790 
it will envelop Mars inside of its coma
and<00:05:20.659> he<00:05:20.810> believes<00:05:20.960> there<00:05:21.380> will<00:05:21.409> be<00:05:21.680> an

deviated<00:05:51.289> escholar<00:05:51.680> ad<00:05:51.919> coming<00:05:52.219> fairly<00:05:52.430> close

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:52.759 
deviated escholar ad coming fairly close

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:54.580 
deviated escholar ad coming fairly close
to<00:05:52.940> earth<00:05:53.090> when<00:05:53.479> I<00:05:53.539> say<00:05:53.719> fairly<00:05:54.020> we're<00:05:54.289> talking

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:54.590 
to earth when I say fairly we're talking

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.290 
to earth when I say fairly we're talking
about<00:05:54.680> several<00:05:55.069> astronomical<00:05:55.789> units<00:05:56.120> but

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
about several astronomical units but

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.290 
about several astronomical units but
still<00:05:56.569> if<00:05:57.349> it<00:05:57.590> changes<00:05:57.979> its<00:05:58.190> orbit<00:05:58.610> and<00:05:58.819> the

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300 
still if it changes its orbit and the

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.920 
still if it changes its orbit and the
earth<00:05:59.479> is<00:05:59.779> comes<00:06:00.380> in<00:06:00.529> proximity<00:06:00.919> to<00:06:01.130> Ison<00:06:01.940> we

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
earth is comes in proximity to Ison we

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.719 
earth is comes in proximity to Ison we
could<00:06:03.110> very<00:06:03.409> well<00:06:03.560> have<00:06:03.889> the<00:06:04.039> same<00:06:04.250> electrical

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:04.729 
could very well have the same electrical

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:06.670 
could very well have the same electrical
exchanges<00:06:05.360> that<00:06:05.389> are<00:06:05.690> predicted<00:06:06.380> to<00:06:06.409> take

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 
exchanges that are predicted to take

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.189 
exchanges that are predicted to take
place<00:06:06.919> between<00:06:07.130> Mars<00:06:07.550> and<00:06:07.699> ice<00:06:07.969> on<00:06:08.240> okay<00:06:09.020> let

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:09.199 
place between Mars and ice on okay let

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:10.269 
place between Mars and ice on okay let
me<00:06:09.289> ask<00:06:09.409> and<00:06:09.680> let<00:06:09.710> me<00:06:09.830> go<00:06:09.949> back<00:06:10.099> and

agree<00:06:25.849> disagree<00:06:26.449> with<00:06:26.930> what<00:06:26.960> Robert<00:06:27.440> just

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620 
agree disagree with what Robert just

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.620 
agree disagree with what Robert just
said<00:06:27.949> is<00:06:28.279> planet<00:06:28.819> ice<00:06:28.940> and<00:06:29.180> something<00:06:29.509> we

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:29.630 
said is planet ice and something we

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.469 
said is planet ice and something we
should<00:06:29.810> be<00:06:29.900> watching<00:06:30.050> do<00:06:30.680> you<00:06:30.860> watch<00:06:31.159> what<00:06:32.090> I

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479 
should be watching do you watch what I

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:34.240 
should be watching do you watch what I
said<00:06:32.659> I'm<00:06:32.810> sorry<00:06:32.870> yeah<00:06:33.620> it<00:06:33.710> is<00:06:33.830> a<00:06:33.860> sungrazer

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.250 
said I'm sorry yeah it is a sungrazer

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.459 
said I'm sorry yeah it is a sungrazer
and<00:06:34.759> certainly<00:06:35.659> it's<00:06:36.050> worth<00:06:36.259> watching

00:06:36.459 --> 00:06:36.469 
and certainly it's worth watching

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:38.529 
and certainly it's worth watching
because<00:06:36.889> if<00:06:37.159> it<00:06:37.279> does<00:06:37.430> trigger<00:06:37.699> a<00:06:38.029> coronal

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:38.539 
because if it does trigger a coronal

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:39.290 
because if it does trigger a coronal
mass<00:06:38.599> ejection

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:39.300 
mass ejection

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.749 
mass ejection
of<00:06:39.509> large<00:06:40.259> magnitude<00:06:40.830> or<00:06:41.069> a<00:06:41.129> player<00:06:41.430> in<00:06:41.669> our

00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:41.759 
of large magnitude or a player in our

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:44.930 
of large magnitude or a player in our
direction<00:06:41.990> your<00:06:42.990> planet<00:06:43.319> Earth<00:06:43.669> this<00:06:44.669> could

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:44.940 
direction your planet Earth this could

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.790 
direction your planet Earth this could
cause<00:06:45.150> a<00:06:45.180> lot<00:06:45.569> of<00:06:45.780> things<00:06:46.110> that<00:06:46.259> the<00:06:46.500> biblical

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 
cause a lot of things that the biblical

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.680 
cause a lot of things that the biblical
prophecies<00:06:47.520> that<00:06:47.669> book<00:06:47.849> revelation<00:06:48.270> talk

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:48.690 
prophecies that book revelation talk

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:50.360 
prophecies that book revelation talk
about<00:06:48.960> what<00:06:49.139> the<00:06:49.259> Sun<00:06:49.470> as<00:06:49.650> far<00:06:49.889> as<00:06:50.009> it<00:06:50.039> getting

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:50.370 
about what the Sun as far as it getting

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:54.559 
about what the Sun as far as it getting
hot<00:06:50.550> and<00:06:50.879> burning<00:06:51.659> trees<00:06:52.110> and<00:06:53.330> burning<00:06:54.330> you're

00:06:54.559 --> 00:06:54.569 
hot and burning trees and burning you're

00:06:54.569 --> 00:06:55.909 
hot and burning trees and burning you're
boiling<00:06:54.780> the<00:06:55.050> fish<00:06:55.259> and<00:06:55.500> a<00:06:55.530> third<00:06:55.740> of<00:06:55.860> the

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:55.919 
boiling the fish and a third of the

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:57.800 
boiling the fish and a third of the
planet<00:06:56.370> which<00:06:56.849> would<00:06:57.000> be<00:06:57.090> about<00:06:57.210> the<00:06:57.449> surface

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:57.810 
planet which would be about the surface

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.749 
planet which would be about the surface
area<00:06:58.110> that<00:06:58.440> would<00:06:58.530> be<00:06:58.650> affected<00:06:58.740> if<00:06:59.460> something

00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 
area that would be affected if something

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:01.939 
area that would be affected if something
like<00:06:59.849> that<00:06:59.909> happens<00:07:00.419> rapidly<00:07:00.720> while<00:07:01.710> the

00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:01.949 
like that happens rapidly while the

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:05.240 
like that happens rapidly while the
earth<00:07:02.190> was<00:07:02.490> turning<00:07:02.930> anyway<00:07:03.930> yeah<00:07:04.770> the

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:05.250 
earth was turning anyway yeah the

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.460 
earth was turning anyway yeah the
electro<00:07:06.000> discharge<00:07:06.180> could<00:07:07.020> well<00:07:07.199> occur<00:07:07.440> i

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:07.470 
electro discharge could well occur i

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.469 
electro discharge could well occur i
agree<00:07:07.889> with<00:07:07.919> velikovsky<00:07:08.699> that<00:07:08.849> and<00:07:09.060> then<00:07:09.270> with

00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:09.479 
agree with velikovsky that and then with

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:11.809 
agree with velikovsky that and then with
McKenney<00:07:09.810> and<00:07:09.870> others<00:07:10.169> that<00:07:10.199> the<00:07:10.819> solar

00:07:23.149 --> 00:07:23.159 
in you know ever being this could have

been a comment Dora an incoming body

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.820 
been a comment Dora an incoming body
that<00:07:26.550> jump<00:07:26.879> orbits<00:07:27.840> and<00:07:28.080> down<00:07:28.349> into<00:07:28.530> where<00:07:28.740> it

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:28.830 
that jump orbits and down into where it

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:30.529 
that jump orbits and down into where it
is<00:07:28.919> now<00:07:29.099> and<00:07:29.129> it's<00:07:29.550> the<00:07:29.699> only<00:07:29.879> glad<00:07:30.090> that<00:07:30.300> spins

00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:30.539 
is now and it's the only glad that spins

00:07:30.539 --> 00:07:34.459 
is now and it's the only glad that spins
backwards<00:07:31.020> very<00:07:31.409> slowly<00:07:32.629> yeah<00:07:33.629> that's<00:07:34.379> a

00:07:34.459 --> 00:07:34.469 
backwards very slowly yeah that's a

00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:36.140 
backwards very slowly yeah that's a
whole<00:07:34.620> discussion<00:07:34.800> and<00:07:35.400> I<00:07:35.460> think<00:07:35.699> the<00:07:35.819> comet

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:36.150 
whole discussion and I think the comet

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:40.790 
whole discussion and I think the comet
ison<00:07:37.129> could<00:07:38.129> affect<00:07:38.580> the<00:07:38.699> sudden<00:07:39.150> now<00:07:39.800> because

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:40.800 
ison could affect the sudden now because
