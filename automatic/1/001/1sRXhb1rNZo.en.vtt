there<00:03:14.740> that<00:03:15.190> looks<00:03:15.430> better<00:03:15.670> set<00:03:16.420> it<00:03:16.540> aside<00:03:16.720> and

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
there that looks better set it aside and

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.470 
there that looks better set it aside and

two<00:03:34.540> side<00:03:34.810> together<00:03:35.020> it<00:03:35.590> should<00:03:35.890> neatly<00:03:36.280> form

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
two side together it should neatly form

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.060 
two side together it should neatly form
into<00:03:37.390> a<00:03:37.420> smaller<00:03:37.870> square<00:03:40.350> fold<00:03:41.350> the<00:03:41.590> square<00:03:41.860> to

the opposite side to form a triangle

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.250 
the opposite side to form a triangle
think<00:03:45.520> of<00:03:45.670> it<00:03:45.820> as<00:03:46.000> if<00:03:46.270> you're<00:03:46.480> trying<00:03:46.780> to<00:03:46.900> cut

think of it as if you're trying to cut

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.740 
think of it as if you're trying to cut
half<00:03:47.620> of<00:03:47.650> a<00:03:48.100> heart<00:03:50.760> so<00:03:51.760> when<00:03:51.940> you<00:03:52.060> open<00:03:52.420> it<00:03:52.540> it

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
half of a heart so when you open it it

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.180 
half of a heart so when you open it it
look<00:03:52.990> like<00:03:53.200> a<00:03:53.230> four<00:03:53.620> heart<00:03:53.920> forming<00:03:54.400> together

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
look like a four heart forming together

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.830 
look like a four heart forming together
now<00:03:57.190> the<00:03:57.250> glue<00:03:57.550> that<00:03:57.580> should<00:03:58.060> be<00:03:58.180> dry<00:03:58.480> we're

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
now the glue that should be dry we're

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.560 
now the glue that should be dry we're
gonna<00:03:58.960> pull<00:03:59.320> the<00:03:59.500> heart<00:03:59.770> together<00:04:00.270> take<00:04:01.270> a<00:04:01.300> pen

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
gonna pull the heart together take a pen

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.900 
gonna pull the heart together take a pen
and<00:04:01.690> a<00:04:01.720> pencil<00:04:01.900> mark<00:04:02.470> at<00:04:02.770> the<00:04:02.980> center<00:04:03.340> cut<00:04:03.880> a

and a pencil mark at the center cut a

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.960 
and a pencil mark at the center cut a

the bottom we're gonna cut from the top

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.990 
the bottom we're gonna cut from the top
remember<00:04:11.320> to<00:04:11.590> cut<00:04:11.800> a<00:04:11.830> little<00:04:12.160> bit<00:04:12.310> past<00:04:12.760> the
