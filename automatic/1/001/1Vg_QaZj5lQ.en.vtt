 Y 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:19.160
 good youtube here I bring you a 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.730
 tutorial on how to put your bike or laptop 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.870
 fast in just three steps ok 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.420
 super simple this 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:31.840
 so we want to put our track 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.910
 quick or laptop for games or for 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.360
 when you go to either go online 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:41.050
 faster and that payment explains step to 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:44.580
 step first step let's go here we go 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.580
 where says 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.040
 are configured and we give right click him 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:55.270
 we give properties 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.150
 and we give you advanced system settings 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.860
 we give and then you send me 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.150
 performance we observe here we give 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:06.160
 settings 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:10.900
 we give you here to the third box you 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:13.840
 we take to adopt for better 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:18.250
 performance we give here to the third 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:21.430
 after that we go we give to play 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.730
 your desk that will change completely 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:28.360
 but it would get faster for the 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:31.020
 videogames and basic we give ok ok 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.750
 then we're out of here then 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.540
 next step 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.920
 the next step we are going to meet the 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.110
 we click right 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.660
 we go by properties we go where it says 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.570
 performance information if before as 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:52.670
 there 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:54.500
 where it says opendisc in the fast and 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.900
 Automatically ease and cow 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:01.060
 we hope you finish sailing 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:05.800
 and what are we doing with this we are 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:08.320
 cleaning the hard disk that disk 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.050
 space that we do not need in our 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.470
 computer, let's hope that you 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.470
 I finished 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.050
 we hope we wait 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:33.920
 I recommend you that these of disc that 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:37.670
 do not do this often, so each 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.490
 once they go they will use the 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.520
 computer 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:45.040
 or elba so I recommend that you 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.200
 open up and do this I 'm 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.890
 doing that then when this 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.950
 there will be candles come on here there are no fans 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.020
 we give it there and they are already cleaning 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.820
 all the failures of those things that do not 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.830
 that our 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.590
 computer then well that we're going to 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.720
 We give ok and I would already be saving the 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.060
 things that we do not need that are 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.740
 taking quiet command space that 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.050
 they are not going to save anyone important 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.220
 only what is not necessary in the 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.510
 computer ok 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.290
 Well, let's go to the next step 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:20.770
 would be the game booster and that fools them 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:23.380
 I have a video that I'm going to put there 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.390
 so they go so they know how 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.050
 download it sail to download it 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.920
 free ok 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:33.290
 We give you here to be boost and what do you do in 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.330
 booster improves the performance of our 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.080
 computer or it gets faster 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:41.390
 when entering the internet or for the 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.370
 same videos I can ok if you want 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.310
 wait for these seconds and not hit the x 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.980
 it does not matter good up here this 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:52.640
 tutorial I hope you serve this video 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.900
 tutorial for how is putting your judgment the 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.140
 fast act 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.390
 in three simple steps candles and these three 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.270
 simple steps will help them a lot 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.980
 they have helped me a lot for the 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.660
 videogame or for the eggs that I carry 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.300
 here 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:11.960
 on the computer I do not expect anything to be 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:14.290
 subscribe to give the video and chau us 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.290
