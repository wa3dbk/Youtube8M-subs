00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.330
 no desire to drive then get it now 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:22.690
 gold old accounts or leveling for 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:24.550
 your favorite mmo just fun run and 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.680
 With that, dear people welcome you to one 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.080
 more video here from the test series with 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.020
 the patch 6.2 yes, after I left you 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.780
 already showed the construction of the shipyard 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.180
 I would like to show you how we do now 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.560
 our first ship is building around her 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.600
 maybe remember we had 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:45.460
 yes, the builder bauer architects 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.980
 shipbuilders more or less freed 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:52.899
 from the clutches of iron hordes above 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:56.680
 in dortmund and now it just means 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:59.530
 Let's learn to build a ship 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.610
 we now here the small template 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:05.009
 you are sitting here in the video to print 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.250
 So we are building a transportation 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:11.650
 troop transporter we in the course 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:15.520
 of patch 6.2 of course also for 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.140
 need our marine mission and the 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.360
 Talking with so attracts to the construction 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.310
 a transport ship to start that 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.990
 Of course we do it now 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.990
 this is also on the side of the horde 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.799
 transporter 150 garnison resources 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.150
 costs a ship or the 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.460
 troop ship 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.280
 we just stop in and have a look 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.909
 how long because the little p us 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:46.320
 should not work here now 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:50.590
 take so long stands up for 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:54.539
 no time or so and yes it will us 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.539
 then added to the ship's collection 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.740
 So it takes a few minutes 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:06.210
 I now just wait times and looks 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.979
 meanwhile stupid in the laundry corsa 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.110
 but what it was not for a long time 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.209
 possible on the side of the horde really 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.370
 here with the construction of the transporter and 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:19.140
 so then with the actual 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.340
 invasion in the firs and continue 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.980
 or continue 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.810
 as has indeed blizzard the first to 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.810
 but I prefer the side of the alliance 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.340
 Unfortunately I can have alliance 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.910
 so do not show 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.920
 but now with the last ptr images in 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.840
 the night of monday was on tuesday 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.250
 that was not at all played by 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.299
 Tuesday to Wednesday we have today 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.530
 have wednesdays and ice tables finished 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:48.430
 here we just the possibility 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.989
 to learn our troop-carrier and 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.120
 You see, you are building a new ship here 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.799
 that are used at marine mission 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.840
 can 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:59.019
 here below, though, is destroyer 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.720
 and it is also in alliance sail the fub 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.310
 So it does not seem quite so 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.120
 to be finished 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.859
 we'll just take a look 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.310
 interact only now again with 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:15.609
 the good one attracts the iron one 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:18.310
 shipbuilder and he says now we 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:21.459
 should meet us with katar just to 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.930
 with the invasion internal 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.880
 continue I have here just 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.359
 once a ship is built that's easy 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:31.150
 again the same video and the 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:33.130
 abomination called the ship saw the 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:37.370
 was suspicious of alliance 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:39.110
 in any case allianz flag 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:47.090
 there you have to see so it has 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:48.980
 allianz sail here in front stands kaka and 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.980
 yes our means of transport is ready the 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:55.900
 invasion of firs can begin 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:58.640
 durethan, the frost wolves are ready 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.190
 seemingly not I say now times because 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:05.390
 he says nothing 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:07.579
 well it does not seem ready yet 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.670
 I'll look if I'm here with Draka 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:12.230
 can interact 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.209
 I will attack you from the sea 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.049
 accompany and protect you 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.199
 while we have a support point internal 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.780
 scout 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:22.610
 ok i can unfortunately the invasion as well 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.820
 It does not seem to start yet 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:28.539
 Just take a look at our frost 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.910
 Wolf throws what we may still here 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:33.500
 did not show or what here 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.780
 maybe new and i have on the 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:42.950
 the other side our transport ship 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:50.270
 but that was maybe good 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:53.470
 ready now has no desire so the 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:56.840
 cross-country skier not ready yet 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:59.660
 that's what we rely on 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.870
 the horde leads to you commander 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.849
 victory says here and here right 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:09.110
 we have our transport ship with us 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:11.510
 sailors the alliance friends of the v6 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.720
 sailor and seaman alliance this 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:18.229
 Clockwork rome over such mark 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:20.060
 see if I can not do what would 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:21.460
 I say okay first, escape a lot 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.530
 Well 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:27.130
 I jump ship once again seaman 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.130
 the alliance 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:34.300
 just take a look 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:35.520
 I hope I hope that's possible at all 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.580
 I'm not sure 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:43.720
 I think that's not a hp sinks 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:47.650
 Also very suspicious are many max and 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:49.780
 That's why I'm good at escaping 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.570
 you are six minutes to death 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.610
 release I say so it is still 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.380
 not as far as I would like and 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.440
 Of course you would like to have shown 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.880
 but at least we have the first 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.470
 transport ship built that I could 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.960
 show you and i would say im 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:07.330
 next video I show you as we do 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:10.900
 along with the red and the frost 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:13.570
 start the invasion from tan on 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:17.400
 and yes, until then, I'll say until 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:17.400
 next does the good job
