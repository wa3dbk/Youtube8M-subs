00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.690
 hello friends and youtube subscribers in 

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:07.330
 this video will teach you how to make a 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:11.440
 chocolate coffee the ingredients that 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:14.860
 we need are a cup of milk a 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:18.279
 common coffee cup this is to your 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:21.410
 ice preference 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:23.550
 chocolate can be in liquid or in 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.910
 bar 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.630
 and sugar to taste 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:32.860
 well what we do next will be 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.860
 invest the milk in the blender 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.150
 the coffee 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.010
 a little sugar 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.250
 Heavens 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:03.720
 and the chocolate remember that if they have 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.720
 in bar they will only put the bar 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.119
 well and then liquefying emos 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.220
 well once liquefied will have that 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.560
 consistency 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.370
 I recommend that after liquefying it 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:27.690
 try it and if you need sugar what 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.880
 add and then liquefy it again 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.240
 well at the moment of serving what we will do 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.620
 is to take a plate 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.480
 Y 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.720
 if you like they can put a little 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.720
 chocolate 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.470
 and what we will do is discard 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.909
 the glass nozzle with chocolate 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.760
 well and we will stay this way 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.180
 and finally we will serve our drink 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.550
