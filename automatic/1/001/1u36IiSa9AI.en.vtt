00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.320

 finally comes petersberg strengthened 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.800
 out of the cabin 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.020
 just the sv drives a super counter yet 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:20.520
 Adrian von Pascal covers the ball 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.570
 well before then the 55 minute runs as it 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.790
 first rang 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.530
 the free kick of Patrick Wingenfeld 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.060

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.180
 Extend scorer Boris Aschenbrücker 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.560

 shot of philip tiedemann is out 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.210
 short distance much too harmless seven 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.460
 minutes later petersberg makes 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.950
 Finally, the bag to last as a man 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.650

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.030
 Andreas shot ice cold 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.770
 Now bronnzell completely collapses 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.289
 in the 73 minute straight 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:08.220
 Substitutes every mm village to the 13 0 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:09.600
 for petersberg same can in the 77 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.910
 minute increase at the same time 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.440
 but only hits the post while 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.300
 the hosts completely give up 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.700
 adrian von patzak even scored 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.600
 shot is still deflected the 4 0 in 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.600
 the 78 minute 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.240

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:41.870
 calmly 10 to 5 from the view of 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:43.190
 Host to the game today is natural 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.540
 quite unhappy believe in the end 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.620
 we were against the game after 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.090
 künzell made a lot 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.200
 because the teams are really good 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.650
 Performance on the attitude 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.600
 brought 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.850
 we are relatively good game 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.200
 have come in the first 15 20 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.950
 minutes' rooms have made very effectively 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.340
 well moved 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.470
 those who have turned off determined by 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.490
 then we have some stupid action 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:24.170
 lost thread 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:36.310
 then falls had he would have determined 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:36.310
 to teach the tuned a bit 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.540
 just stay tuned 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.850
 we have the time again very much 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.040
 played efficiently 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:48.020
 break 0 0 a little dissatisfied 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.920
 Seitenhalt the first half I think 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.100
 I already have some dominance 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:57.410
 had some chances but still exercised 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:04:01.520
 close to this must continue 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:03.620
 Actually we have been very diligent 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.510
 Second half also very efficient 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.190
 Team works next 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.760
 time wonderful so I 'm happy for 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.189
 each 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.439
 flowers under the strokes even for the 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:14.610
 training operation for that too and 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:16.530
 in the end that is really now 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:20.060
 wonderful what we are now for a first 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.060
 have started
