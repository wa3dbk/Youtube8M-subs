percent of that came from the ocean you
use<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.020> same<00:01:31.229> line<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.860> it's<00:01:32.100> like<00:01:32.400> why

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
use the same line and it's like why

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.550 
use the same line and it's like why
should<00:01:33.299> we<00:01:33.630> mess<00:01:33.840> with<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.170> we<00:01:34.320> should<00:01:34.500> be

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
should we mess with that we should be
