00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.530
 segob and the nor represented the company corn and cosmetics in Argentina 

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:09.530
 in this opportunity I'm going to show you a video with the techniques for thermos 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.590
 pimenta ar eyebrows with the system the port 

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:28.859
 The first thing we have to do is remove the anesthetic cream that 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.090
 we let act between 20 and 30 minutes 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.090
 i proceed to pillar 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.910
 so ja to optimize the way 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.960
 it is convenient 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.090
 leave as much of the patient's hair 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.910
 within what is going to constitute the design so that they are still boasting 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.910
 more natural 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.760
 we removed from the lower area 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.020
 the shape 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.930
 giving it more breadth 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.930
 in the outer area of ​​the eyebrow 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.040
 the inclination so that the inner part 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.930
 get lower 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.930
 and make us an eye make 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.460
 contrary to what is believed 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.460
 you can ventilate the brow of the upper area 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.290
 once finished 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.290
 the right eyebrow 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.890
 let's move on 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.890
 on the left 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.620
 equaling or at least approaching as much as possible 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.970
 to the shape of the afternoon 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.360
 from the left hand 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.050
 and we are ready 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.029
 then 

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:10.659
 start designing 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:12.109
 with the brush 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:13.539
 and the pigment 

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:16.539
 what are we going though maybe 

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:18.629
 fundamental 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.109
 is to take into account 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:23.079
 what the patient should be sure 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:28.040
 who wants to get the job done before we proceed to depilate 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:36.839
 next we will see how the design on paper is posed then a 

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:41.879
 practice on synthetic and finally work directly on the 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.409
 patient 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:51.589
 let's go from there an ideal face that unfortunately lacks eyebrows oo 

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:55.389
 that has as man in many cases an eyebrow is presented 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:58.729
 sparsely populated with a way of saying nothing 

00:02:58.729 --> 00:03:01.429
 the first that we have to do 

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:06.339
 based on ideal face measurements yes this usually 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:08.409
 it does 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:10.839
 with a brush measures are taken 

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:12.170
 i by brand 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.179
 where should we 

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:16.329
 place the new eyebrow
