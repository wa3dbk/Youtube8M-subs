00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.229 
destroyed by those guys alright so this
game<00:00:48.719> i'm<00:00:48.840> actually<00:00:49.020> using<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.579> an-94<00:00:50.579> with

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
game i'm actually using the an-94 with

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.660 
game i'm actually using the an-94 with
select<00:00:51.780> fire<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.829> good<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.309> actually

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
select fire and this good is actually

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.729 
select fire and this good is actually
very<00:00:53.699> very<00:00:54.120> unique<00:00:54.690> with<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.170> select<00:00:55.530> fire

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
very very unique with the select fire

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.880 
very very unique with the select fire
because<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:57.000> two-round<00:00:57.870> burst<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.710> you

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
because it is a two-round burst and you

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.010 
because it is a two-round burst and you
might<00:00:59.039> be<00:00:59.070> thinking<00:00:59.160> two-round<00:00:59.820> burst<00:01:00.020> why

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
might be thinking two-round burst why

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.360 
might be thinking two-round burst why
the<00:01:01.079> fuck<00:01:01.350> would<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.559> want<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.890> use<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.160> two

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
the fuck would you want to use the two

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.640 
the fuck would you want to use the two
round<00:01:02.640> burst<00:01:02.940> well<00:01:03.239> there<00:01:04.199> actually<00:01:04.320> are

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
round burst well there actually are

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.679 
round burst well there actually are
quite<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.949> few<00:01:05.010> benefits<00:01:05.369> for<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.510> with

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
quite a few benefits for it and with

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.179 
quite a few benefits for it and with
this<00:01:06.810> gun<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.200> actually<00:01:07.439> really<00:01:07.680> makes<00:01:07.890> sense

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
this gun and actually really makes sense

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.390 
this gun and actually really makes sense
i'll<00:01:08.340> explain<00:01:08.729> why<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:10.049> an-94<00:01:10.530> actually

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
i'll explain why so the an-94 actually

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.850 
i'll explain why so the an-94 actually
when<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:11.729> put<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.180> when<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.260> put<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.560> select

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
when you put the when you put the select

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.100 
when you put the when you put the select
fire<00:01:14.100> on<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.880> accuracy<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.479> gonna<00:01:15.750> go<00:01:15.930> up

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
fire on it the accuracy is gonna go up

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.840 
fire on it the accuracy is gonna go up
on<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.500> for<00:01:16.740> whatever<00:01:17.009> reason<00:01:17.340> they<00:01:17.430> put<00:01:17.790> that

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
on it for whatever reason they put that

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.460 
on it for whatever reason they put that
in<00:01:18.090> if<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.270> have<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.540> burst<00:01:18.750> if<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.200> burst

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
in if you have the burst if you burst

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.260 
in if you have the burst if you burst
fire<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.830> guns<00:01:20.009> they<00:01:20.250> uh<00:01:20.280> they<00:01:20.939> make<00:01:21.150> the

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
fire the guns they uh they make the

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.520 
fire the guns they uh they make the
accuracy<00:01:21.750> better<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.280> it<00:01:23.280> puts<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.049> the<00:01:25.049> rate

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
accuracy better and it puts the the rate

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.840 
accuracy better and it puts the the rate
of<00:01:25.560> fire<00:01:25.890> up<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.340> might<00:01:26.460> be<00:01:26.490> thinking<00:01:26.580> how

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
of fire up and you might be thinking how

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.429 
of fire up and you might be thinking how
the<00:01:26.880> fuck<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.330> but<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.600> rate<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.780> fire<00:01:28.049> up<00:01:28.259> if

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
the fuck is but the rate of fire up if

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.590 
the fuck is but the rate of fire up if
you're<00:01:28.920> just<00:01:29.100> putting<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:30.000> know<00:01:30.119> putting<00:01:30.420> it

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
you're just putting you know putting it

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.819 
you're just putting you know putting it
into<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.869> select-fire<00:01:31.229> let<00:01:31.560> shouldn't<00:01:31.740> that

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
into a select-fire let shouldn't that

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.950 
into a select-fire let shouldn't that
make<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.189> rate<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.460> fire<00:01:32.700> go<00:01:32.939> lower<00:01:33.150> well<00:01:33.810> the

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
make the rate of fire go lower well the

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.780 
make the rate of fire go lower well the
an-94<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.740> actually<00:01:34.979> very<00:01:35.009> unique<00:01:35.549> in<00:01:35.670> the

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
an-94 is actually very unique in the

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.390 
an-94 is actually very unique in the
first<00:01:36.030> two<00:01:36.299> shots<00:01:36.600> are<00:01:36.930> faster<00:01:37.530> than<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.250> rest

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
first two shots are faster than the rest

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.190 
first two shots are faster than the rest
of<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.670> shots<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.240> if<00:01:39.270> your<00:01:39.600> full<00:01:39.780> auto<00:01:39.990> for

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
of the shots so if your full auto for

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.710 
of the shots so if your full auto for
example<00:01:40.560> it's<00:01:40.680> like<00:01:40.829> it's<00:01:41.310> like<00:01:41.340> Papa<00:01:42.329> Papa

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
example it's like it's like Papa Papa

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.300 
example it's like it's like Papa Papa
and<00:01:42.899> just<00:01:43.079> slows<00:01:43.409> down<00:01:43.439> but<00:01:44.040> when<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.280> have

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310

warships<00:02:57.990> on<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.650> same<00:02:58.890> light<00:02:59.100> but<00:02:59.310> what

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
warships on the same light but what

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.920 
warships on the same light but what
sucked<00:02:59.700> was<00:02:59.820> they<00:02:59.940> have<00:03:00.060> somebody<00:03:00.450> put<00:03:00.660> one<00:03:00.840> of

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
sucked was they have somebody put one of

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.780 
sucked was they have somebody put one of
those<00:03:01.020> stealth<00:03:01.800> choppers<00:03:02.310> in<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.430> air<00:03:02.520> and<00:03:02.730> I

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
those stealth choppers in the air and I

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.760 
those stealth choppers in the air and I
couldn't<00:03:03.030> call<00:03:03.300> the<00:03:03.480> warship<00:03:03.930> in<00:03:04.170> and<00:03:04.590> wound

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
couldn't call the warship in and wound

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.800 
couldn't call the warship in and wound
up<00:03:04.860> getting<00:03:05.010> another<00:03:05.310> warship<00:03:05.910> before<00:03:06.570> I<00:03:06.600> can

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
up getting another warship before I can

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.540 
up getting another warship before I can
use<00:03:07.050> that<00:03:07.260> one<00:03:07.530> as<00:03:07.560> you<00:03:07.890> guys<00:03:08.040> know<00:03:08.070> it's<00:03:08.490> just

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
use that one as you guys know it's just

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.190 
use that one as you guys know it's just
like<00:03:08.670> modern<00:03:08.910> warfare<00:03:09.180> 3<00:03:09.300> if<00:03:09.600> you<00:03:09.720> recycle

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
like modern warfare 3 if you recycle

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.750 
like modern warfare 3 if you recycle
your<00:03:10.350> streets<00:03:10.620> before<00:03:10.770> you<00:03:10.980> before<00:03:11.370> you<00:03:11.550> use

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
your streets before you before you use

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.030 
your streets before you before you use
them<00:03:11.940> it<00:03:12.209> just<00:03:12.630> goes<00:03:12.810> away<00:03:12.990> so<00:03:13.680> even<00:03:13.920> though<00:03:13.950> I

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
them it just goes away so even though I

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.010 
them it just goes away so even though I
earn<00:03:14.250> to<00:03:14.520> veto<00:03:14.730> warships<00:03:15.209> I<00:03:15.300> only<00:03:15.540> was<00:03:15.720> able<00:03:15.810> to

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
earn to veto warships I only was able to

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.810 
earn to veto warships I only was able to
actually<00:03:16.200> use<00:03:16.680> one<00:03:16.980> which<00:03:17.220> is<00:03:17.430> kind<00:03:17.760> of

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
actually use one which is kind of

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.490 
actually use one which is kind of
unfortunate<00:03:17.940> because<00:03:18.540> I<00:03:18.870> could<00:03:19.410> have

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
unfortunate because I could have

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.840 
unfortunate because I could have
probably<00:03:19.590> been<00:03:19.830> a<00:03:19.890> really<00:03:20.130> really<00:03:20.340> big<00:03:20.580> game

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
probably been a really really big game

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.940 
probably been a really really big game
but<00:03:21.330> actually<00:03:22.050> my<00:03:22.140> worship<00:03:22.500> I'm<00:03:22.709> preacher

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
but actually my worship I'm preacher

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.550 
but actually my worship I'm preacher
gets<00:03:23.190> shot<00:03:23.610> down<00:03:23.900> pretty<00:03:24.900> quickly<00:03:25.200> and<00:03:25.470> I

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
gets shot down pretty quickly and I

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.140 
gets shot down pretty quickly and I
probably<00:03:26.040> thank<00:03:26.310> Adam<00:03:26.640> for<00:03:26.820> that<00:03:26.940> because

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
probably thank Adam for that because

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.000 
probably thank Adam for that because
Adam<00:03:27.480> was<00:03:27.510> destroying<00:03:28.019> them<00:03:28.320> with<00:03:28.470> a<00:03:28.500> warship

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
Adam was destroying them with a warship

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.759 
Adam was destroying them with a warship

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
double points while they're up in the

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.280 
double points while they're up in the

air instead of getting ten points for
the<00:03:55.440> assisting<00:03:55.739> at<00:03:55.830> 20<00:03:56.100> then<00:03:56.220> all<00:03:56.310> these<00:03:56.400> point

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
the assisting at 20 then all these point

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.449 
the assisting at 20 then all these point
stacking<00:03:57.120> up<00:03:57.239> he's<00:03:57.810> got<00:03:58.070> 145<00:03:59.070> points<00:03:59.250> off

stacking up he's got 145 points off

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.250 
stacking up he's got 145 points off
assists<00:03:59.940> that's<00:04:00.180> fantastic<00:04:00.989> i'm<00:04:01.110> gonna

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
assists that's fantastic i'm gonna

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.259 
assists that's fantastic i'm gonna
fast-forward<00:04:01.560> this<00:04:01.950> up<00:04:02.220> warship<00:04:03.000> cuz<00:04:03.150> it

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
fast-forward this up warship cuz it

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:04.340 
fast-forward this up warship cuz it
wasn't<00:04:03.450> in<00:04:03.540> the<00:04:03.630> air<00:04:03.750> for<00:04:03.900> all<00:04:03.989> that<00:04:04.110> long

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
wasn't in the air for all that long

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.110 
wasn't in the air for all that long
anyway<00:04:04.830> so<00:04:04.890> might<00:04:05.340> as<00:04:05.400> well<00:04:05.549> just<00:04:05.670> speed<00:04:05.940> it<00:04:05.970> up

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
anyway so might as well just speed it up

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.550 
anyway so might as well just speed it up
look<00:04:06.390> I'm<00:04:06.540> think<00:04:07.049> I'm<00:04:07.110> gonna<00:04:07.170> get<00:04:07.350> shot<00:04:07.500> down

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
look I'm think I'm gonna get shot down

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
look I'm think I'm gonna get shot down
like<00:04:07.769> you're<00:04:08.010> right<00:04:08.130> about<00:04:08.250> now<00:04:08.519> yes<00:04:08.910> I<00:04:09.090> just

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
like you're right about now yes I just

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.340 
like you're right about now yes I just
transitioned<00:04:11.580> off<00:04:11.700> it<00:04:11.910> so<00:04:12.420> this<00:04:12.600> a<00:04:12.750> and<00:04:12.900> 94

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
transitioned off it so this a and 94

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.600 
transitioned off it so this a and 94
guys<00:04:13.560> honestly<00:04:13.950> I<00:04:14.190> think<00:04:14.280> you<00:04:14.430> guys<00:04:14.580> should

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
guys honestly I think you guys should

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.120 
guys honestly I think you guys should
give<00:04:14.850> it<00:04:14.910> a<00:04:14.970> try<00:04:15.000> work<00:04:15.510> it<00:04:15.660> up<00:04:15.810> to<00:04:16.080> the<00:04:16.410> to<00:04:17.100> the

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
give it a try work it up to the to the

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.949
