and that just carried my entire life so
I<00:00:14.280> want<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.670> do<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.880> really<00:00:15.330> nice<00:00:15.540> job<00:00:15.599> of<00:00:16.289> this

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
I want to do a really nice job of this

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.519 
I want to do a really nice job of this
so<00:00:17.580> some<00:00:18.000> of<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.180> things<00:00:18.390> you<00:00:18.570> could<00:00:18.779> have<00:00:19.320> on

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
so some of the things you could have on

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.380 
so some of the things you could have on
hand<00:00:19.890> is<00:00:20.180> red<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.480> black<00:00:21.689> electrical<00:00:22.680> tape<00:00:22.740> I

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
hand is red and black electrical tape I

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.089 
hand is red and black electrical tape I
grew<00:00:24.390> up<00:00:24.420> on<00:00:24.689> electrical<00:00:25.289> tape<00:00:25.500> that'd<00:00:25.859> be<00:00:26.039> an

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
grew up on electrical tape that'd be an

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.500 
grew up on electrical tape that'd be an
electrician<00:00:26.550> we<00:00:26.880> used<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.210> for<00:00:27.240> everything

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
electrician we used it for everything

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.259 
electrician we used it for everything
batt<00:00:28.170> handles<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:29.910> know<00:00:30.029> just

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
batt handles and you know just

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.600 
batt handles and you know just
everything<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.720> can<00:00:30.990> imagine<00:00:31.500> but<00:00:32.219> there's<00:00:32.550> a

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
everything you can imagine but there's a

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.160 
everything you can imagine but there's a
new<00:00:32.790> thing<00:00:33.000> on<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.239> market<00:00:33.390> -<00:00:33.780> it's<00:00:34.020> called

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
new thing on the market - it's called

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.400 
new thing on the market - it's called
liquid<00:00:34.610> electrical<00:00:35.610> tape<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:37.050> will<00:00:37.260> be

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
liquid electrical tape and this will be

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.369 
liquid electrical tape and this will be
maybe<00:00:37.860> if<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.399> know<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.809> solenoids

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
maybe if I know that the the solenoids

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.010 
maybe if I know that the the solenoids
in<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.739> really<00:00:41.070> wet<00:00:41.309> location<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.329> might<00:00:42.540> use<00:00:42.840> it

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
in a really wet location I might use it

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.080 
in a really wet location I might use it
on<00:00:43.170> some<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.620> connections<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.399> protect

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
on some of the connections to protect

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.520 
on some of the connections to protect
them<00:00:45.300> but<00:00:46.079> have<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.289> on<00:00:46.649> hand<00:00:47.420> then<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:49.020> ends

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
them but have that on hand then the ends

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.700 
them but have that on hand then the ends
of<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.890> cable<00:00:50.100> ties<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:50.969> that's<00:00:51.210> where<00:00:51.449> you're

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
of the cable ties so that's where you're

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.170 
of the cable ties so that's where you're
susceptible<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.739> water<00:00:53.190> getting<00:00:53.699> in<00:00:53.850> and

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
susceptible to water getting in and

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.880 
susceptible to water getting in and
corrosion<00:00:54.930> so<00:00:55.649> I've<00:00:55.980> got<00:00:56.160> these<00:00:56.340> shrink

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
corrosion so I've got these shrink

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.349 
corrosion so I've got these shrink
things<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:59.190> don't<00:00:59.399> forget<00:00:59.670> what<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.969> real<00:01:00.149> name

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
things I don't forget what the real name

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.560 
things I don't forget what the real name
of<00:01:00.570> them<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:00.870> heat<00:01:01.379> shrink<00:01:01.739> tubing<00:01:02.129> sleeves

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
of them is heat shrink tubing sleeves

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.920 
of them is heat shrink tubing sleeves
and<00:01:03.570> these<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.890> course<00:01:05.129> everything<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:06.030> red

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
and these of course everything is red

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.929 
and these of course everything is red
and<00:01:07.170> black<00:01:07.409> when<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:07.950> comes<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.430> car<00:01:09.439> stuff<00:01:10.439> and

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
and black when it comes to car stuff and

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:13.490 
and black when it comes to car stuff and
the<00:01:11.939> red<00:01:12.180> being<00:01:12.450> positive<00:01:13.020> black<00:01:13.170> being

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
the red being positive black being

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.429 
the red being positive black being
negative<00:01:14.060> but<00:01:15.060> these<00:01:15.210> have<00:01:15.420> adhesive<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:16.229> them

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
negative but these have adhesive in them

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.130 
negative but these have adhesive in them
so<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:17.549> put<00:01:17.790> these<00:01:17.939> right<00:01:18.270> near<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.720> cable

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
so you put these right near the cable

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.929 
so you put these right near the cable
ends<00:01:19.500> we'll<00:01:20.100> see<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:20.430> later<00:01:20.490> when<00:01:20.880> we

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
ends we'll see this later when we

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.679 
ends we'll see this later when we
actually<00:01:21.360> do<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.520> then<00:01:23.520> heat<00:01:24.030> them<00:01:24.180> up<00:01:24.360> and

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
actually do it and then heat them up and

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.990 
actually do it and then heat them up and
they<00:01:24.960> shrink<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.950> adhesive<00:01:26.280> inside

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
they shrink and the adhesive inside

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.880 
they shrink and the adhesive inside
shrinks<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:27.900> makes<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.200> waterproof<00:01:28.860> seal

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
shrinks that makes a waterproof seal

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.670 
shrinks that makes a waterproof seal
right<00:01:29.430> there<00:01:29.700> at<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.880> end<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.479> cable<00:01:31.259> and

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
right there at the end of the cable and

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.219 
right there at the end of the cable and
another<00:01:32.610> thing<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.030> don't<00:01:33.060> have<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.540> shown<00:01:33.840> here

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
another thing I don't have it shown here

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.450 
another thing I don't have it shown here
but<00:01:34.439> it's<00:01:35.009> possible<00:01:35.640> I'll<00:01:36.650> heat<00:01:37.650> up<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:38.040> ends

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
but it's possible I'll heat up the ends

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.660 
but it's possible I'll heat up the ends
of<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.729> cable<00:01:39.210> also<00:01:39.979> any<00:01:40.979> copper<00:01:41.490> that's

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
of the cable also any copper that's

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.690 
of the cable also any copper that's
sticking<00:01:41.939> out<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.570> solder<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.500> even<00:01:44.280> more

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
sticking out and solder it to even more

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.770 
sticking out and solder it to even more
make<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.360> great<00:01:46.159> seal<00:01:47.159> there<00:01:47.430> now<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.450> do<00:01:48.600> this

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
make a great seal there now to do this

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.060 
make a great seal there now to do this
you<00:01:49.020> have<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.320> have<00:01:49.380> some<00:01:49.590> type<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:49.799> heat

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
you have to have some type of heat

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.940 
you have to have some type of heat
source<00:01:50.369> so<00:01:50.729> this<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.470> inexpensive<00:01:52.470> heat<00:01:52.680> gun

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
source so this is a inexpensive heat gun

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.219 
source so this is a inexpensive heat gun
I<00:01:53.220> mean<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.060> could<00:01:54.210> use<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.390> torch<00:01:54.810> but<00:01:55.140> you

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
I mean you could use a torch but you

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.639 
I mean you could use a torch but you
have<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.439> be<00:01:55.560> careful<00:01:55.950> burning<00:01:56.369> stuff<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:57.390> this

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
have to be careful burning stuff so this

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.230 
have to be careful burning stuff so this
you<00:01:58.649> know<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:58.890> is<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.100> think<00:01:59.490> this<00:01:59.759> is<00:01:59.850> 20

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
you know this is I think this is 20

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.020 
you know this is I think this is 20
bucks<00:02:00.450> or<00:02:00.659> something<00:02:00.840> for<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.259> heat<00:02:01.469> gun<00:02:02.030> now

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
bucks or something for a heat gun now

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.090 
bucks or something for a heat gun now
this<00:02:03.420> isn't<00:02:03.659> really<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.770> kind<00:02:04.979> of

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
this isn't really the the kind of

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.850 
this isn't really the the kind of
Loctite<00:02:05.460> I'm<00:02:05.670> going<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:05.939> use<00:02:06.149> this<00:02:06.649> you<00:02:07.649> want

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
Loctite I'm going to use this you want

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.969 
Loctite I'm going to use this you want
the<00:02:08.069> Loctite<00:02:09.030> blue<00:02:09.420> which<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:10.080> removable<00:02:10.619> but

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
the Loctite blue which is removable but

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.030 
the Loctite blue which is removable but
this<00:02:11.220> will<00:02:11.489> be<00:02:11.520> when<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:11.970> screw<00:02:12.660> the

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
this will be when I screw the

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.589 
this will be when I screw the
solenoid<00:02:14.819> into<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:16.310> inner<00:02:17.310> fender<00:02:17.819> well<00:02:17.849> I'll

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
solenoid into the inner fender well I'll

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.479 
solenoid into the inner fender well I'll
put<00:02:18.989> some<00:02:19.140> Loctite<00:02:19.380> on<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:20.010> so<00:02:20.190> it<00:02:20.310> doesn't

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
put some Loctite on it so it doesn't

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.660 
put some Loctite on it so it doesn't
shake<00:02:20.849> loose<00:02:21.060> on<00:02:21.360> me<00:02:21.950> but<00:02:22.950> this<00:02:23.160> is<00:02:23.340> not<00:02:23.520> the

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
shake loose on me but this is not the

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.630 
shake loose on me but this is not the
right<00:02:23.819> one<00:02:24.060> that'll<00:02:24.360> be<00:02:24.450> locked<00:02:24.930> tight<00:02:25.140> blue

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
right one that'll be locked tight blue

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.010 
right one that'll be locked tight blue
now<00:02:26.640> these<00:02:27.270> are<00:02:28.520> what<00:02:29.520> they<00:02:29.640> call<00:02:30.020> wire

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
now these are what they call wire

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.920 
now these are what they call wire
conduit<00:02:31.739> flame-retardant<00:02:32.600> so<00:02:33.600> of<00:02:33.750> course

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
conduit flame-retardant so of course

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.290 
conduit flame-retardant so of course
I've<00:02:34.170> got<00:02:34.410> red<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:34.709> black<00:02:35.130> again<00:02:35.640> so<00:02:35.970> for<00:02:36.150> the

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
I've got red and black again so for the

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.930 
I've got red and black again so for the
positive<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:36.959> negative<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:37.830> it's<00:02:38.580> split

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
positive and negative and it's split

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.130 
positive and negative and it's split
down<00:02:39.569> the<00:02:39.630> middle

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
down the middle

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.170 
down the middle
so<00:02:40.470> I<00:02:40.500> can<00:02:40.890> get<00:02:41.069> the<00:02:41.220> cable<00:02:41.670> in<00:02:41.819> there<00:02:42.000> that

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
so I can get the cable in there that

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.410 
so I can get the cable in there that
even<00:02:42.330> comes<00:02:42.720> with<00:02:42.870> a<00:02:43.280> we<00:02:44.280> get<00:02:44.730> this<00:02:44.880> over<00:02:45.239> here

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
even comes with a we get this over here

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.140 
even comes with a we get this over here
there's<00:02:45.720> a<00:02:45.870> up<00:02:46.080> a<00:02:46.470> little<00:02:47.280> tool<00:02:47.519> that<00:02:47.790> makes<00:02:47.940> it

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
there's a up a little tool that makes it

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.470 
there's a up a little tool that makes it
easy<00:02:48.390> for<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:49.260> to<00:02:49.350> slide<00:02:49.590> cable<00:02:50.330> into<00:02:51.330> this

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
easy for you to slide cable into this

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.100 
easy for you to slide cable into this
thing<00:02:52.489> but<00:02:53.489> I<00:02:53.910> have<00:02:54.330> to<00:02:54.450> actually<00:02:54.780> learn<00:02:54.900> how

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
thing but I have to actually learn how

and this will make a really nice job and

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.870 
and this will make a really nice job and
protect<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.910> cables<00:03:03.450> that<00:03:04.019> we're<00:03:04.440> using<00:03:04.880> to

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
protect the cables that we're using to

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.600 
protect the cables that we're using to
run<00:03:06.060> from<00:03:06.450> one<00:03:06.750> battery<00:03:07.170> to<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.620> solenoid<00:03:08.220> and

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
run from one battery to the solenoid and

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.460 
run from one battery to the solenoid and
across<00:03:09.060> from<00:03:09.330> the<00:03:09.420> other<00:03:09.540> batteries<00:03:10.140> as<00:03:10.350> you

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
across from the other batteries as you

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.650 
across from the other batteries as you
see<00:03:10.680> a<00:03:10.709> little<00:03:10.890> later<00:03:11.090> then<00:03:12.090> of<00:03:12.239> course<00:03:12.480> we're

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
see a little later then of course we're

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.300 
see a little later then of course we're
going<00:03:12.780> to<00:03:12.840> hold<00:03:13.019> them<00:03:13.170> in<00:03:13.290> with<00:03:13.470> zip<00:03:13.680> ties<00:03:13.920> so

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
going to hold them in with zip ties so

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.039 
going to hold them in with zip ties so
they<00:03:14.459> don't<00:03:14.670> flop<00:03:14.970> around<00:03:15.180> in<00:03:15.630> the<00:03:15.750> engine

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
they don't flop around in the engine

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.259 
they don't flop around in the engine
compartment<00:03:16.280> that's<00:03:17.280> what<00:03:17.519> those<00:03:17.700> are<00:03:18.030> and

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
compartment that's what those are and

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.130 
compartment that's what those are and
then<00:03:18.620> here<00:03:19.620> this<00:03:19.829> is<00:03:19.890> what's<00:03:20.280> left<00:03:20.519> of<00:03:20.880> the

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
then here this is what's left of the

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.220 
then here this is what's left of the
universal<00:03:22.280> battery<00:03:23.280> hold-down<00:03:23.700> kit<00:03:24.209> I<00:03:24.239> got<00:03:24.570> at

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
universal battery hold-down kit I got at

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.460 
universal battery hold-down kit I got at
autozone<00:03:26.239> where<00:03:27.239> you<00:03:27.450> put<00:03:27.989> a<00:03:28.019> little<00:03:28.109> rubber

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
autozone where you put a little rubber

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.380 
autozone where you put a little rubber
block<00:03:28.950> at<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.400> bottom<00:03:29.730> of<00:03:29.820> the<00:03:29.880> battery<00:03:30.090> and

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
block at the bottom of the battery and

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.300 
block at the bottom of the battery and
that's<00:03:30.630> what<00:03:30.870> I<00:03:30.900> needed<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.470> long<00:03:31.650> extension

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
that's what I needed the long extension

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.460 
that's what I needed the long extension
for<00:03:32.910> to<00:03:33.030> go<00:03:33.150> down<00:03:33.329> and<00:03:33.600> tighten<00:03:33.930> it<00:03:33.989> down<00:03:34.049> to

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
for to go down and tighten it down to

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.849 
for to go down and tighten it down to
hold<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:35.160> secondary<00:03:35.730> battery<00:03:36.180> in<00:03:36.359> so<00:03:37.079> this<00:03:37.799> is

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
hold the secondary battery in so this is

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.680 
hold the secondary battery in so this is
these<00:03:38.489> are<00:03:38.670> the<00:03:38.760> kinds<00:03:39.090> of<00:03:39.150> things<00:03:39.420> didn't

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
these are the kinds of things didn't

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.140 
these are the kinds of things didn't
cost<00:03:39.870> a<00:03:40.109> lot<00:03:40.230> of<00:03:40.290> extra<00:03:40.709> money<00:03:40.739> to<00:03:41.670> make<00:03:42.120> a

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
cost a lot of extra money to make a

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.300 
cost a lot of extra money to make a
really<00:03:42.720> really<00:03:42.750> nice<00:03:43.230> job<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:43.980> I<00:03:44.040> try<00:03:44.250> to
