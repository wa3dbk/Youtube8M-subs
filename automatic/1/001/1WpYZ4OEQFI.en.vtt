PC<00:00:34.640> 4000<00:00:35.539> and<00:00:35.719> has<00:00:35.960> a<00:00:35.989> CES<00:00:36.590> of<00:00:37.120> 2.5<00:00:38.120> with<00:00:38.780> a

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
PC 4000 and has a CES of 2.5 with a

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.549 
PC 4000 and has a CES of 2.5 with a
complete<00:00:39.350> memory<00:00:39.620> timing<00:00:40.190> of<00:00:40.390> 2.5<00:00:41.390> for<00:00:42.019> four

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
complete memory timing of 2.5 for four

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.779 
complete memory timing of 2.5 for four
and<00:00:42.890> eight<00:00:43.399> now<00:00:43.969> what<00:00:44.149> does<00:00:44.359> DDR<00:00:45.109> and<00:00:45.410> CS<00:00:46.250> mean

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
and eight now what does DDR and CS mean

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:49.720 
and eight now what does DDR and CS mean
DDR<00:00:47.780> f<00:00:47.899> stands<00:00:48.140> for<00:00:48.320> double<00:00:49.010> data<00:00:49.219> rate<00:00:49.339> and

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
DDR f stands for double data rate and

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.729 
DDR f stands for double data rate and
that<00:00:49.969> means<00:00:50.239> it<00:00:50.510> doubles<00:00:50.989> the<00:00:51.050> bandwidth<00:00:51.530> of

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
that means it doubles the bandwidth of

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.220 
that means it doubles the bandwidth of
the<00:00:51.800> memory<00:00:52.309> by<00:00:52.429> transferring<00:00:53.030> data<00:00:53.329> twice<00:00:53.899> as

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
the memory by transferring data twice as

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.380 
the memory by transferring data twice as
fast<00:00:54.440> on<00:00:54.739> both<00:00:55.010> the<00:00:55.219> rising<00:00:55.789> and<00:00:55.969> the<00:00:56.359> falling

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
fast on both the rising and the falling

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.860 
fast on both the rising and the falling
of<00:00:56.929> the<00:00:57.019> clock<00:00:57.499> cycle<00:00:57.980> CS<00:00:58.670> stands<00:00:59.030> for<00:00:59.329> column

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
of the clock cycle CS stands for column

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.979 
of the clock cycle CS stands for column
access<00:01:00.320> select<00:01:00.679> or<00:01:01.030> column<00:01:02.030> accessed<00:01:02.600> robe

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
access select or column accessed robe

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.170 
access select or column accessed robe
and<00:01:03.289> that<00:01:03.710> essentially<00:01:04.070> means<00:01:04.220> the<00:01:04.730> number<00:01:04.760> of

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
and that essentially means the number of

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.150 
and that essentially means the number of
cycles<00:01:05.449> for<00:01:05.930> the<00:01:06.080> memory<00:01:06.350> to<00:01:06.530> get<00:01:06.740> information

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
cycles for the memory to get information

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.690 
cycles for the memory to get information
and<00:01:07.640> then<00:01:08.210> process<00:01:08.870> that<00:01:09.440> information<00:01:09.700> also

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
and then process that information also

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.300 
and then process that information also
keep<00:01:10.850> in<00:01:11.030> mind<00:01:11.090> that<00:01:11.510> a<00:01:11.660> lower<00:01:11.960> CS<00:01:12.590> is<00:01:12.830> much

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
keep in mind that a lower CS is much

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.480 
keep in mind that a lower CS is much
better<00:01:13.940> than<00:01:14.150> a<00:01:14.210> higher<00:01:14.600> CES<00:01:15.200> for<00:01:15.830> example<00:01:16.340> a

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
better than a higher CES for example a

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.960 
better than a higher CES for example a
CES<00:01:17.210> of<00:01:17.420> two<00:01:17.720> will<00:01:18.260> result<00:01:18.710> in<00:01:18.920> better<00:01:19.370> memory

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
CES of two will result in better memory

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.100 
CES of two will result in better memory
performance<00:01:20.120> than<00:01:20.870> 2.5<00:01:21.860> or<00:01:22.250> three<00:01:23.180> so<00:01:23.660> try<00:01:23.990> and

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
performance than 2.5 or three so try and

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.950 
performance than 2.5 or three so try and
keep<00:01:24.170> the<00:01:24.470> CES<00:01:24.890> as<00:01:25.130> low<00:01:25.520> as<00:01:25.700> possible<00:01:25.960> when

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
keep the CES as low as possible when

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.650 
keep the CES as low as possible when
overclocking<00:01:27.590> this<00:01:28.160> memory<00:01:28.550> is<00:01:28.790> dual<00:01:29.240> channel

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
overclocking this memory is dual channel

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.510 
overclocking this memory is dual channel
which<00:01:29.990> means<00:01:30.230> better<00:01:30.530> overall<00:01:31.040> memory

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
which means better overall memory

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.540 
which means better overall memory
bandwidth<00:01:31.940> resulting<00:01:32.600> in<00:01:32.780> superior

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
bandwidth resulting in superior

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.670 
bandwidth resulting in superior
performance<00:01:34.550> but<00:01:34.820> in<00:01:35.390> order<00:01:35.840> to<00:01:35.930> benefit<00:01:36.500> from

which means they have a 128 bit memory
interface<00:01:55.040> now<00:01:55.610> this<00:01:55.790> memory<00:01:56.210> will<00:01:56.480> work<00:01:56.930> in<00:01:57.200> a

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:03.219 
look at where all these LEDs are there

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:07.440 
look at where all these LEDs are there
are<00:03:03.430> a<00:03:03.459> lot<00:03:04.230> first<00:03:05.230> of<00:03:05.469> all<00:03:05.620> on<00:03:05.919> the<00:03:06.730> base<00:03:07.060> of

each side at the camera adjust itself

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.270 
each side at the camera adjust itself
here<00:03:16.120> for<00:03:16.329> focus<00:03:16.719> and<00:03:16.959> I'll<00:03:17.650> show<00:03:17.919> you<00:03:17.950> them

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
here for focus and I'll show you them

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.759 
here for focus and I'll show you them
there<00:03:19.090> is<00:03:19.239> one<00:03:19.569> right<00:03:19.930> here<00:03:20.909> here<00:03:22.650> here<00:03:23.650> and

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
there is one right here here here and

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.680 
there is one right here here here and
here<00:03:25.229> same<00:03:26.229> for<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.709> other<00:03:26.949> side<00:03:27.549> so<00:03:28.449> you<00:03:28.479> get

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
here same for the other side so you get

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.240 
here same for the other side so you get
a<00:03:28.720> blue<00:03:29.400> ground<00:03:30.400> effect<00:03:31.239> on<00:03:31.540> each<00:03:32.439> memory

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
a blue ground effect on each memory

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.580 
a blue ground effect on each memory
module<00:03:33.819> there<00:03:34.419> are<00:03:34.540> also<00:03:34.750> 16<00:03:35.790> active<00:03:36.810> LEDs<00:03:37.810> at

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
module there are also 16 active LEDs at

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.819 
module there are also 16 active LEDs at
the<00:03:39.370> top<00:03:39.639> and<00:03:40.239> what<00:03:40.389> I<00:03:40.449> mean<00:03:40.599> by<00:03:40.659> active<00:03:41.260> is<00:03:41.620> as

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
the top and what I mean by active is as

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:45.390 
the top and what I mean by active is as
the<00:03:42.639> memory<00:03:42.970> goes<00:03:43.209> under<00:03:43.689> more<00:03:44.049> load<00:03:44.650> they

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
the memory goes under more load they

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.399 
the memory goes under more load they
will<00:03:45.609> increase<00:03:46.090> in<00:03:46.269> speed<00:03:46.659> what<00:03:47.259> you're

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:47.409 
will increase in speed what you're

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:50.249 
will increase in speed what you're
looking<00:03:47.500> at<00:03:47.829> here<00:03:47.889> is<00:03:48.340> the<00:03:48.909> memory<00:03:49.419> as<00:03:49.870> the

00:03:50.249 --> 00:03:50.259 
looking at here is the memory as the

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:54.629 
looking at here is the memory as the
system<00:03:51.009> boots<00:03:51.669> up<00:03:52.150> you<00:03:52.870> can<00:03:53.049> see<00:03:53.349> it<00:03:53.639> going

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:54.639 
system boots up you can see it going

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:58.099 
system boots up you can see it going
through<00:03:54.909> its<00:03:55.060> cycle<00:03:55.509> here<00:03:55.689> not<00:03:56.169> very<00:03:56.549> fast<00:03:57.549> and

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
through its cycle here not very fast and

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.319 
through its cycle here not very fast and
now<00:03:59.109> you're<00:03:59.409> looking<00:03:59.739> at<00:03:59.949> it<00:04:00.129> when<00:04:00.879> it's<00:04:01.030> just

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
now you're looking at it when it's just

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.879 
now you're looking at it when it's just
idling<00:04:01.930> opening<00:04:02.859> a<00:04:02.919> few<00:04:03.099> programs<00:04:03.609> in<00:04:03.939> windows

idling opening a few programs in windows

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:09.479 
idling opening a few programs in windows
not<00:04:05.889> again<00:04:06.310> a<00:04:06.340> lot<00:04:06.669> of<00:04:06.729> activity<00:04:07.409> however<00:04:08.489> look

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
not again a lot of activity however look

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.089 
not again a lot of activity however look
at<00:04:09.669> it<00:04:09.849> now<00:04:10.509> this<00:04:11.139> is<00:04:11.199> actually<00:04:11.470> running<00:04:11.829> a

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 
at it now this is actually running a

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:16.319 
at it now this is actually running a
benchmark<00:04:12.909> memory<00:04:13.900> program<00:04:14.680> certainly<00:04:15.639> taxes

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
benchmark memory program certainly taxes

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.120 
benchmark memory program certainly taxes
the<00:04:16.539> memory<00:04:16.930> and<00:04:17.109> puts<00:04:17.590> it<00:04:17.650> on<00:04:17.739> a<00:04:17.799> tremendous

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
the memory and puts it on a tremendous

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.999 
the memory and puts it on a tremendous
load<00:04:18.759> and<00:04:19.209> you<00:04:19.389> can<00:04:19.570> certainly<00:04:19.810> see<00:04:20.289> how

00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:21.009 
load and you can certainly see how

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:23.459 
load and you can certainly see how
active<00:04:21.609> it<00:04:21.729> is<00:04:21.820> now<00:04:22.090> and<00:04:22.419> now<00:04:23.080> let's<00:04:23.289> have<00:04:23.440> a

look<00:04:23.740> at<00:04:23.830> it<00:04:23.889> when<00:04:24.039> the<00:04:24.700> system<00:04:24.940> is<00:04:25.289> shutting

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:26.289 
look at it when the system is shutting

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:27.960 
look at it when the system is shutting
down

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
down

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.810 
down
well<00:04:28.180> again<00:04:28.960> become<00:04:29.440> very<00:04:29.920> inactive<00:04:30.400> and

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
well again become very inactive and

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.170 
well again become very inactive and
finally<00:04:31.600> turn<00:04:32.050> off<00:04:32.400> also<00:04:33.400> you<00:04:33.460> noticed<00:04:33.940> the

finally turn off also you noticed the

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.620 
finally turn off also you noticed the
ground<00:04:34.810> effect<00:04:35.410> blue<00:04:35.770> on<00:04:35.800> the<00:04:35.950> bottom<00:04:36.630> very
