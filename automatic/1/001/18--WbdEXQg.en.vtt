thx<00:00:07.740> to<00:00:08.280> discuss<00:00:08.639> some<00:00:08.849> fascinating<00:00:09.420> new

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
thx to discuss some fascinating new

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.879 
thx to discuss some fascinating new
technology<00:00:09.990> that<00:00:10.019> has<00:00:10.170> been<00:00:10.290> developed<00:00:10.800> here

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
technology that has been developed here

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.160 
technology that has been developed here
which<00:00:11.130> I<00:00:11.730> think<00:00:11.910> it's<00:00:12.389> designed<00:00:12.719> to<00:00:12.840> address<00:00:13.019> a

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
which I think it's designed to address a

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.539 
which I think it's designed to address a
certain<00:00:13.710> number<00:00:13.769> of<00:00:13.920> factors<00:00:14.280> but<00:00:14.400> let's

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
certain number of factors but let's

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.189 
certain number of factors but let's
start<00:00:14.759> with<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:15.059> problem<00:00:15.420> sweet<00:00:15.719> spot<00:00:15.960> Laurie

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
start with the problem sweet spot Laurie

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.950 
start with the problem sweet spot Laurie
a<00:00:16.460> sweet<00:00:17.460> spot<00:00:17.670> used<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.060> be<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.210> very<00:00:18.449> small<00:00:18.750> one

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
a sweet spot used to be a very small one

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.929 
a sweet spot used to be a very small one
just<00:00:18.990> in<00:00:19.380> front<00:00:19.590> of<00:00:19.770> you<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:20.430> what's<00:00:20.640> happened

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
just in front of you and what's happened

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.240 
just in front of you and what's happened
as<00:00:21.029> families<00:00:21.510> become<00:00:22.170> more<00:00:22.320> social<00:00:22.769> now<00:00:23.100> they

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
as families become more social now they

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.070 
as families become more social now they
want<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.460> sit<00:00:23.670> anywhere<00:00:23.939> so<00:00:24.630> what<00:00:24.720> we've<00:00:24.930> done

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
want to sit anywhere so what we've done

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.529 
want to sit anywhere so what we've done
is<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.769> create<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:26.160> technology<00:00:26.519> that<00:00:27.300> wherever

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
is to create a technology that wherever

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.560 
is to create a technology that wherever
you<00:00:27.960> sit<00:00:28.019> we<00:00:28.680> can<00:00:29.189> bring<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.550> music<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.939> you

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
you sit we can bring the music to you

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.930 
you sit we can bring the music to you
the<00:00:31.140> base<00:00:31.260> is<00:00:31.410> addressing<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.920> fact<00:00:32.130> that<00:00:32.189> at

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
the base is addressing the fact that at

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.310 
the base is addressing the fact that at
the<00:00:33.000> television<00:00:33.510> becomes<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.899> center<00:00:34.200> of

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
the television becomes the center of

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.389 
the television becomes the center of
someone's<00:00:34.800> home

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
someone's home

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.330 
someone's home
everyone's<00:00:36.149> sitting<00:00:36.329> there<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:37.110> only<00:00:37.680> in<00:00:38.040> the

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
everyone's sitting there and only in the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.850 
everyone's sitting there and only in the
old<00:00:38.489> way<00:00:38.640> they<00:00:39.510> see<00:00:39.570> this<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.050> middle<00:00:40.200> sweet

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
old way they see this the middle sweet

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.260 
old way they see this the middle sweet
spot<00:00:41.100> we're<00:00:41.579> gonna<00:00:41.700> get<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:41.940> best<00:00:42.120> sound

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
spot we're gonna get the best sound

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.430 
spot we're gonna get the best sound
everyone<00:00:42.629> else<00:00:42.750> with<00:00:42.840> basically<00:00:43.110> can<00:00:43.350> hear

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
everyone else with basically can hear

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.860 
everyone else with basically can hear
compromise<00:00:43.890> effectively<00:00:44.489> it's<00:00:45.120> partly<00:00:45.480> as

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
compromise effectively it's partly as

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:46.880 
compromise effectively it's partly as
part<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.260> fact<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:46.440> don't<00:00:46.680> want

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
part of the fact you don't want

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.279 
part of the fact you don't want
necessarily<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.789> listen<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.180> what<00:00:48.329> somebody

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
necessarily to listen to what somebody

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.350 
necessarily to listen to what somebody
else<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.620> listening<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.820> with<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.149> you're

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
else is listening to so with this you're

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.939 
else is listening to so with this you're
able<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.809> do<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.230> we<00:00:52.379> can<00:00:52.559> direct<00:00:52.800> these

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
able to do that we can direct these

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.459 
able to do that we can direct these
sound<00:00:53.640> beams<00:00:53.879> towards<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.750> have<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.110> not

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
sound beams towards you and have it not

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.750 
sound beams towards you and have it not
have<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:56.160> can<00:00:56.309> be<00:00:56.399> different<00:00:56.730> things

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
have it it can be different things

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.180 
have it it can be different things
different<00:00:57.239> programs<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.379> sort<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.859> have<00:00:59.010> what

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
different programs and sort of have what

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.099 
different programs and sort of have what
you<00:00:59.309> want<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.609> sort<00:00:59.879> of<00:00:59.969> ultimate<00:01:00.359> selfish<00:01:00.960> it

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
you want is sort of ultimate selfish it

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.020 
you want is sort of ultimate selfish it
experience<00:01:01.739> but<00:01:01.949> without<00:01:02.280> upsetting<00:01:02.579> other

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
experience but without upsetting other

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.880 
experience but without upsetting other
people<00:01:03.420> okay<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.530> guess<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.769> first

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
people okay so I guess the first

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.620 
people okay so I guess the first
question<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.369> how<00:01:05.729> do<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:05.909> achieve<00:01:06.030> this<00:01:06.390> then

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
question is how do you achieve this then

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.109 
question is how do you achieve this then
basically<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:07.619> about<00:01:07.650> steering<00:01:08.250> sound<00:01:08.760> and

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
basically is about steering sound and

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.399 
basically is about steering sound and
we've<00:01:09.240> known<00:01:09.479> about<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:09.810> for<00:01:10.020> some<00:01:10.380> time

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
we've known about that for some time

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.100 
we've known about that for some time
they've<00:01:11.130> been<00:01:11.159> obstacles<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.270> if<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.869> want<00:01:13.049> to

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
they've been obstacles to if you want to

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.600 
they've been obstacles to if you want to
steer<00:01:13.320> sound<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.770> have<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.040> have<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.189> perfect

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
steer sound you have to have a perfect

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.820 
steer sound you have to have a perfect
source<00:01:15.049> normally<00:01:16.049> they're<00:01:16.229> either<00:01:16.320> too<00:01:16.619> big

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
source normally they're either too big

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.590 
source normally they're either too big
or<00:01:16.860> too<00:01:17.100> small<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.909> we've<00:01:18.060> come<00:01:18.299> up<00:01:18.330> with<00:01:18.570> a

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
or too small and we've come up with a

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.120 
or too small and we've come up with a
way<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.869> doing<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.290> by<00:01:19.500> taking<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.920> round

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
way of doing that by taking a round

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.399 
way of doing that by taking a round
source<00:01:20.549> like<00:01:20.850> this<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.630> turning<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.110> into<00:01:22.259> a

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
source like this and turning it into a

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.679 
source like this and turning it into a
narrow<00:01:22.680> slot<00:01:23.070> don't<00:01:23.790> lose<00:01:24.030> anything<00:01:24.360> on<00:01:24.540> this

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
narrow slot don't lose anything on this

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.690 
narrow slot don't lose anything on this
um<00:01:24.930> what<00:01:25.259> we<00:01:25.380> do<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:25.650> do<00:01:26.220> three<00:01:26.490> things

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
um what we do is do three things

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.700 
um what we do is do three things
essentially<00:01:27.420> we<00:01:27.720> can<00:01:27.840> make<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.110> smaller<00:01:28.409> we

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
essentially we can make it smaller we

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.920 
essentially we can make it smaller we
can<00:01:29.250> change<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.970> packaging<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.570> design

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
can change the packaging and design

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.420 
can change the packaging and design
options<00:01:31.470> but<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.009> probably<00:01:32.310> more

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
options but and probably more

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.249 
options but and probably more
importantly<00:01:32.939> we<00:01:33.119> control<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.780> way<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.900> sound

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
importantly we control the way the sound

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.020 
importantly we control the way the sound
comes<00:01:34.650> out<00:01:34.829> so<00:01:35.159> let's<00:01:35.369> say<00:01:35.490> we<00:01:35.579> had<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.729> slot

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
comes out so let's say we had a slot

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.050 
comes out so let's say we had a slot
like<00:01:36.210> this<00:01:36.270> for<00:01:36.720> example<00:01:40.369> these<00:01:41.369> individual

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
like this for example these individual

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.330 
like this for example these individual
elements<00:01:42.479> here<00:01:42.689> are<00:01:42.899> omnidirectional<00:01:43.770> in

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
elements here are omnidirectional in

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.730 
elements here are omnidirectional in
this<00:01:44.490> way<00:01:44.670> this<00:01:45.240> way<00:01:45.450> there's<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.170> same<00:01:46.380> sound

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
this way this way there's the same sound

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.060 
this way this way there's the same sound
because<00:01:47.340> they're<00:01:47.549> small<00:01:47.790> in<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.659> way<00:01:49.070> the

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
because they're small in this way the

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.100 
because they're small in this way the
directionality<00:01:50.759> now<00:01:51.210> depends<00:01:51.899> on

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
directionality now depends on

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.679 
directionality now depends on
essentially<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.860> couple<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.399> things<00:01:53.610> how<00:01:54.450> long

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
essentially a couple of things how long

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.840 
essentially a couple of things how long
the<00:01:54.869> line<00:01:55.049> is<00:01:55.259> what<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.979> spacing<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.579> is<00:01:56.700> so

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
the line is what the spacing is is so

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.630 
the line is what the spacing is is so
forth<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.479> longer<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.110> make<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.469> line<00:01:58.649> the

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
forth the longer you make the line the

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.700 
forth the longer you make the line the
lower<00:01:59.939> frequency<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:00.630> can<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:01.140> can<00:02:01.350> direct

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
lower frequency you can you can direct

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.280 
lower frequency you can you can direct
direct<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.399> sound<00:02:02.689> their<00:02:03.689> closer<00:02:03.960> together

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
direct the sound their closer together

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.230 
direct the sound their closer together
you<00:02:04.649> make<00:02:04.890> them<00:02:05.100> then<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.520> higher<00:02:05.670> frequency

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
you make them then the higher frequency

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.749 
you make them then the higher frequency

go higher or lower the important thing
here<00:02:15.790> is<00:02:15.819> that<00:02:15.970> you<00:02:16.180> can<00:02:16.420> do<00:02:16.540> what<00:02:16.720> you<00:02:16.840> want<00:02:17.080> so

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
here is that you can do what you want so

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:18.990 
here is that you can do what you want so
this<00:02:17.680> one<00:02:17.860> allows<00:02:18.099> you<00:02:18.310> to<00:02:18.430> do<00:02:18.550> this<00:02:18.760> for

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
this one allows you to do this for

whatever you want to do is just find

whatever you want to do is just find
grannies<00:02:35.739> in<00:02:35.769> the<00:02:35.980> corner<00:02:36.340> she<00:02:36.940> what<00:02:37.060> she

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
grannies in the corner she what she

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:38.280 
grannies in the corner she what she
doesn't<00:02:37.390> want<00:02:37.569> to<00:02:37.660> hear<00:02:37.750> what<00:02:37.870> you're<00:02:38.019> hearing

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
doesn't want to hear what you're hearing

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.680 
doesn't want to hear what you're hearing
she<00:02:38.530> doesn't<00:02:38.920> have<00:02:39.069> to<00:02:39.280> so<00:02:39.910> we<00:02:40.060> can<00:02:40.239> swing<00:02:40.569> it

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
she doesn't have to so we can swing it

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.660 
she doesn't have to so we can swing it
right<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.260> way<00:02:41.290> over<00:02:41.590> to<00:02:41.709> there<00:02:41.890> right<00:02:42.549> the

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
right the way over to there right the

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.089 
right the way over to there right the
way<00:02:42.760> over<00:02:42.970> to<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.209> other<00:02:43.239> side<00:02:43.630> I<00:02:43.959> think<00:02:44.410> the

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 
way over to the other side I think the

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:46.650 
way over to the other side I think the
most<00:02:45.250> difficult<00:02:45.489> thing<00:02:45.819> we<00:02:46.060> haven't<00:02:46.329> solved

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
most difficult thing we haven't solved

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.289 
most difficult thing we haven't solved
with<00:02:46.780> this<00:02:46.930> was<00:02:47.790> amplification<00:02:48.790> empathize<00:02:49.269> a

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
with this was amplification empathize a

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:52.559 
with this was amplification empathize a
big<00:02:49.630> heavy<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:51.459> good<00:02:51.610> ones<00:02:51.790> are<00:02:51.940> anyway<00:02:52.329> and

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
big heavy the good ones are anyway and

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.319 
big heavy the good ones are anyway and
they<00:02:53.349> give<00:02:54.250> out<00:02:54.400> a<00:02:54.430> lot<00:02:54.610> of<00:02:54.640> heat<00:02:54.910> so<00:02:55.090> we<00:02:55.180> came

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
they give out a lot of heat so we came

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:56.610 
they give out a lot of heat so we came
up<00:02:55.390> with<00:02:55.599> a<00:02:55.660> brand<00:02:55.930> new<00:02:55.989> amplifier

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
up with a brand new amplifier

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.580 
up with a brand new amplifier
essentially<00:02:57.310> which<00:02:57.489> is<00:02:57.700> its<00:02:58.599> analog<00:02:58.900> and

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
essentially which is its analog and

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.650 
essentially which is its analog and
Long's<00:02:59.860> absolutely<00:03:00.849> fine<00:03:01.090> but<00:03:01.269> we<00:03:01.510> overcame

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
Long's absolutely fine but we overcame

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.619 
Long's absolutely fine but we overcame
the<00:03:02.230> limitations<00:03:03.190> of<00:03:03.310> analog<00:03:03.640> by<00:03:03.819> making<00:03:04.480> one

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:04.629 
the limitations of analog by making one

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:06.780 
the limitations of analog by making one
with<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:04.840> tracking<00:03:05.099> supplies<00:03:06.099> such<00:03:06.489> that

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
with the tracking supplies such that

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.940 
with the tracking supplies such that
when<00:03:07.510> it's<00:03:07.660> doing<00:03:07.900> nothing<00:03:08.260> it<00:03:08.470> takes<00:03:08.739> nothing

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
when it's doing nothing it takes nothing

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.740 
when it's doing nothing it takes nothing
so<00:03:09.459> it<00:03:09.519> probably<00:03:09.670> has<00:03:09.970> one<00:03:10.000> of<00:03:10.299> the<00:03:10.390> lowest

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
so it probably has one of the lowest

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.360 
so it probably has one of the lowest
standing<00:03:11.230> dissipations<00:03:11.890> of<00:03:12.069> any<00:03:12.190> amplifier

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
standing dissipations of any amplifier

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.490 
standing dissipations of any amplifier

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.590 
another circuit techniques and we have a
patent<00:03:20.019> pending<00:03:21.010> on<00:03:21.340> this<00:03:21.489> and<00:03:22.150> you<00:03:22.299> can<00:03:22.450> see

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
patent pending on this and you can see

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.580 
patent pending on this and you can see
for<00:03:22.690> yourself<00:03:23.019> how<00:03:23.200> it's<00:03:23.319> done<00:03:23.410> but

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
for yourself how it's done but

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.729 
for yourself how it's done but
essentially<00:03:24.190> it<00:03:24.430> matches<00:03:25.269> the<00:03:25.480> demand<00:03:25.989> of<00:03:26.380> the

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
essentially it matches the demand of the

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.979 
essentially it matches the demand of the
of<00:03:27.069> the<00:03:27.340> of<00:03:27.579> the<00:03:27.849> program<00:03:28.299> the<00:03:28.569> amplifier<00:03:28.959> to

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
of the of the program the amplifier to

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.839 
of the of the program the amplifier to
the<00:03:29.230> demand<00:03:29.470> of<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:29.680> program<00:03:30.040> in<00:03:30.220> the<00:03:30.639> same

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
the demand of the program in the same

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:32.009 
the demand of the program in the same
way<00:03:31.030> we're<00:03:31.180> trying<00:03:31.329> to<00:03:31.480> match<00:03:31.630> the<00:03:31.870> music

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
way we're trying to match the music

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.170 
way we're trying to match the music
delivery<00:03:32.650> to<00:03:32.950> the<00:03:33.069> demands<00:03:33.400> of<00:03:33.609> the<00:03:33.670> customer

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
delivery to the demands of the customer

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.509 
delivery to the demands of the customer
so<00:03:34.420> it's<00:03:34.540> not<00:03:34.630> about<00:03:34.810> us<00:03:34.870> pushing<00:03:35.380> something<00:03:36.250> -

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
so it's not about us pushing something -

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.280 
so it's not about us pushing something -
it's<00:03:36.819> about<00:03:37.060> us<00:03:37.299> giving<00:03:37.750> them<00:03:37.989> what<00:03:38.139> they<00:03:38.170> want

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
it's about us giving them what they want

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.589 
it's about us giving them what they want
it's<00:03:38.769> instant<00:03:39.250> it's<00:03:39.459> now<00:03:39.669> and<00:03:40.000> it's<00:03:40.239> simple

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 
it's instant it's now and it's simple

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:41.819 
it's instant it's now and it's simple
okay

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
okay

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:44.729 
okay
that's<00:03:42.700> the<00:03:42.910> amplification<00:03:43.329> and<00:03:43.989> the<00:03:44.290> speaker

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
that's the amplification and the speaker

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.220 
that's the amplification and the speaker
array<00:03:44.980> how<00:03:45.730> is<00:03:45.880> it<00:03:45.970> all<00:03:46.120> controlled<00:03:46.540> well

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
array how is it all controlled well

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.920 
array how is it all controlled well
basically<00:03:47.410> the<00:03:47.739> system<00:03:48.099> that<00:03:48.220> we<00:03:48.370> use<00:03:48.639> is<00:03:49.030> we

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
basically the system that we use is we

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.629 
basically the system that we use is we
run<00:03:50.349> all<00:03:50.500> the<00:03:50.620> software<00:03:50.980> is<00:03:51.099> straightforward

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:51.639 
run all the software is straightforward

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:54.330 
run all the software is straightforward
PC<00:03:52.000> software<00:03:52.239> but<00:03:52.690> it<00:03:52.780> said<00:03:53.530> it<00:03:53.709> is<00:03:53.859> a<00:03:53.889> network

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
PC software but it said it is a network

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.339 
PC software but it said it is a network
system<00:03:54.819> so<00:03:55.239> if<00:03:55.389> we<00:03:55.480> look<00:03:55.630> at<00:03:55.720> this<00:03:55.840> board<00:03:56.079> here

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 
system so if we look at this board here

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:59.699 
system so if we look at this board here
for<00:03:56.380> example<00:03:57.030> and<00:03:58.030> we<00:03:58.120> look<00:03:58.239> at<00:03:58.359> this<00:03:58.450> for

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
for example and we look at this for

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.699 
for example and we look at this for
it'll<00:04:00.370> be<00:04:00.489> alright<00:04:00.579> okay<00:04:01.180> this<00:04:01.780> is<00:04:01.959> one<00:04:02.500> of<00:04:02.530> the

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
it'll be alright okay this is one of the

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.229 
it'll be alright okay this is one of the
boards<00:04:03.069> within<00:04:03.280> this<00:04:03.489> particular<00:04:03.849> system

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
boards within this particular system

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.960 
boards within this particular system
it's<00:04:04.480> got<00:04:04.569> 92<00:04:04.989> channels<00:04:05.590> this<00:04:06.069> is<00:04:06.250> one<00:04:06.730> board

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
it's got 92 channels this is one board

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.420 
it's got 92 channels this is one board
which<00:04:07.269> has<00:04:07.299> a<00:04:07.780> twenty<00:04:08.230> form<00:04:08.439> we<00:04:08.590> use<00:04:08.620> 23<00:04:09.129> of

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
which has a twenty form we use 23 of

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.410 
which has a twenty form we use 23 of
them<00:04:09.689> what<00:04:10.689> you<00:04:10.720> see<00:04:11.049> on<00:04:11.200> this<00:04:11.379> is<00:04:11.739> is<00:04:12.150> each<00:04:13.150> one

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
them what you see on this is is each one

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.869 
them what you see on this is is each one
of<00:04:13.540> these<00:04:13.629> represents<00:04:13.930> an<00:04:14.470> output<00:04:14.829> stage<00:04:15.159> so

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:15.879 
of these represents an output stage so

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:18.330 
of these represents an output stage so
the<00:04:15.970> 24<00:04:16.449> of<00:04:16.570> those<00:04:16.690> each<00:04:17.019> one<00:04:17.229> of<00:04:17.320> these<00:04:17.440> is<00:04:17.949> a

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
the 24 of those each one of these is a

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.090 
the 24 of those each one of these is a
tracking<00:04:18.820> supply<00:04:19.359> that<00:04:20.289> whole<00:04:20.440> board<00:04:20.799> there

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
tracking supply that whole board there

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.060 
tracking supply that whole board there
will<00:04:21.370> give<00:04:21.549> out<00:04:21.729> a<00:04:21.759> peak<00:04:22.539> output<00:04:22.750> by<00:04:23.530> peak<00:04:23.830> I

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
will give out a peak output by peak I

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.790 
will give out a peak output by peak I
mean<00:04:24.340> as<00:04:24.550> long<00:04:25.240> as<00:04:25.300> any<00:04:25.720> program<00:04:26.440> would

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
mean as long as any program would

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.529 
mean as long as any program would
requires<00:04:27.190> on<00:04:27.430> about<00:04:27.639> same<00:04:27.940> ways<00:04:28.150> it's<00:04:28.389> about

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:28.539 
requires on about same ways it's about

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:31.650 
requires on about same ways it's about
program<00:04:29.110> and<00:04:29.520> so<00:04:30.520> this<00:04:30.699> board<00:04:30.940> actually<00:04:31.509> can

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
program and so this board actually can

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.990 
program and so this board actually can
deliver<00:04:31.930> 2400<00:04:32.800> watts<00:04:33.010> and<00:04:33.340> there<00:04:33.610> are<00:04:33.699> four<00:04:33.970> of

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
deliver 2400 watts and there are four of

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.540 
deliver 2400 watts and there are four of
these<00:04:34.300> in<00:04:34.360> the<00:04:34.690> system<00:04:35.139> the<00:04:36.070> interesting

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
these in the system the interesting

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:37.920 
these in the system the interesting
thing<00:04:36.729> about<00:04:36.760> it<00:04:37.180> is<00:04:37.300> that<00:04:37.330> all<00:04:37.750> the

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
thing about it is that all the

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.420 
thing about it is that all the
components<00:04:38.229> here<00:04:38.620> are<00:04:38.680> very<00:04:38.860> simple<00:04:39.280> there

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
components here are very simple there

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.029 
components here are very simple there
are<00:04:39.520> no<00:04:39.750> electric<00:04:40.750> capacitors<00:04:41.560> there<00:04:41.830> are<00:04:41.919> no

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:42.039 
are no electric capacitors there are no

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:44.730 
are no electric capacitors there are no
inductors<00:04:42.580> so<00:04:43.030> it's<00:04:43.180> very<00:04:43.300> thin<00:04:43.740> three

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
inductors so it's very thin three

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.330 
inductors so it's very thin three
millimeters<00:04:45.310> again<00:04:45.729> it's<00:04:46.270> about<00:04:46.570> packaging

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
millimeters again it's about packaging

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.680 
millimeters again it's about packaging
but<00:04:48.340> the<00:04:48.460> most<00:04:48.610> important<00:04:49.150> thing<00:04:49.240> is<00:04:49.360> it<00:04:49.510> runs

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
but the most important thing is it runs

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.510 
but the most important thing is it runs
cool<00:04:50.020> as<00:04:50.139> a<00:04:50.169> cucumber<00:04:50.289> which<00:04:50.889> means<00:04:51.160> we<00:04:51.370> don't

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
cool as a cucumber which means we don't

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.159 
cool as a cucumber which means we don't
need<00:04:51.699> big<00:04:51.910> heat<00:04:52.120> sinks<00:04:52.510> and<00:04:52.690> you<00:04:52.750> can<00:04:52.870> put<00:04:53.050> it

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
need big heat sinks and you can put it

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.170 
need big heat sinks and you can put it
in<00:04:53.260> rec<00:04:53.530> and<00:04:53.770> serve<00:04:53.949> them<00:04:54.039> so<00:04:54.190> that<00:04:54.340> it's<00:04:54.820> it's

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
in rec and serve them so that it's it's

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.180 
in rec and serve them so that it's it's
supposed<00:04:55.660> to<00:04:55.780> be<00:04:55.960> what<00:04:56.380> people<00:04:56.740> want<00:04:56.979> these

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
supposed to be what people want these

can think of with lights modes and

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:21.980 
can think of with lights modes and

settings you can do with this so now you

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.140
