00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:10.710
 despite the almost general distrust 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.679
 around one more pro evolution soccer 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.299
 of konami shows that there are still letters in the 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.359
 manga to regain the public 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:23.310

 look here the presence of the fox and indigenous

 undoubtedly the great enhancement of the game 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.809
 game has become more compelling in 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.899
 various aspects with players 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.820
 moving more realistically 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:47.370
 even the goalkeepers move toward the 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.530
 ball in a less robotic way 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.820
 essential to improve the experience of 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.070
 game 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.920
 In addition, athletes are more 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.079
 smart people, they better 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.420
 available field spaces left 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.650
 the opposing team and even give 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.420
 a trolley to cut crosses 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.750
 so you have an environment conducive to

 the good football with 2014 feet achieving 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.830
 to reproduce the dynamism of football 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:18.180
 with the appropriate limitations is 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.820
 clear before you even start a match 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.070
 you will notice a beautiful novelty the 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.470
 boys are simpler without so many 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.680
 options but that the game can 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.079
 offer beyond that now you choose 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.299
 your heart team and it will decorate the 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:38.280

 news for pro football fans 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.490

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.579
 more demanding game if you want the 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.380
 new in-depth pass options 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:52.590
 cross-country and goal kick can 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.509
 such actions - automatic requiring more 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.390
 player but also providing 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.340
 more precision for those who want just the 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.590
 simply return to normal mode. 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.450
 and you have the same system 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.370
 always at your disposal 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.790
 If you like to attend stadiums of 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.210
 football to feel at home on foot 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.190
 2014 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.650
 a good news is the increase in 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.780
 number of custom corners that you 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.570
 probably heard in the bleachers 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.690
 while accompanying your heart team 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.760
 in addition the rich and tracks also more 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.660
 personalized greatly enhance the 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.660
 game atmosphere 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.270
 we can not stop talking about the function 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.820
 hart that will make your athletes 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.250
 become more or less motivated 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.960
 as they hit or is bad during a 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.670
 match 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:48.650
 is more a pinch of realism and feet 2014 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.360
 South American fans who already had the 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.820
 and the teams of the 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.730
 Brazilian championship will win two more 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:58.490
 news the Argentine and Chilean leagues 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.800
 are officially licensed and 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.950
 South America is again highlighted in the 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.950
 game 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.959
 as has been common in other years 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.300
 again the konami was not able to 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.160
 to license some of the major clubs and 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.590
 world selections 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.260
 in the case of uniform clubs and also 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.940
 names are changed something that does not 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.140
 makes gaming unfeasible 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:32.000
 but takes a little bit of the degree of realism 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.860
 furthermore the problem with casts 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.570
 outdated without negotiations 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.860
 carried out in the last month for 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:41.810
 also it appears normally takes pes 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.100
 to launch a package to update the 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.690
 casts which is also a little frustrating 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.480
 It looks like the game is coming 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.780
 to the limit of the current generation 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.820
 graphic gains are remarkable but the 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.190
 fall in the number of staff in some 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.380
 Moments is especially glaring 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.630
 during some replays this takes a 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.560
 little of the brightness of the game and should be targeted 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:09.260
 of criticism from quite a few people 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.900
 the online pass part is not bad but it is 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.600
 poor there are not many game options and 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.010
 You will still suffer from leds even with 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.690
 quick connections 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.220
 This is one more problem. 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.420
 accompanied the game over the last few 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:25.730
 and has not yet been resolved 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.290
 to play online anyway you're already going 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.870
 need to install a 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.460
 update because it seems the game 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.530
 out of the oven without being totally 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:37.540
 ready in this respect 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.540
 negative point until 2014 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:51.740
 if you liked feet 2013 migrate to 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.050
 2014 is a natural process especially 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.310
 because the current game is better than the 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.710
 his predecessor 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.080
 those who distrusted may be the 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.910
 time to give konami a chance again 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.370
 a good job was done in several 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.630
 aspects 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.730
 despite failures that were not 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.340
 corrected as is the case of online mode 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:13.400
 limited and block rate falls 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.560
 during the 2014 game shows that 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.410
 his producer got his hands on to create 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.990
 a good football game a half term 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:23.150
 between cage simulation with realism and 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.250
 intelligence enough to amuse 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.320
 you and your friends 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:31.330

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.330
