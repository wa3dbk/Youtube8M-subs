00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.010 
these things but I just want to share my
experience<00:00:32.579> with<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:33.120> think<00:00:33.390> that's<00:00:33.690> what

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
experience with it I think that's what

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.080 
experience with it I think that's what
people<00:00:34.200> care<00:00:34.530> about<00:00:34.590> more<00:00:34.980> than<00:00:35.040> anything<00:00:35.250> is

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
people care about more than anything is

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.470 
people care about more than anything is
just<00:00:36.840> does<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.350> work<00:00:37.500> or<00:00:37.710> not<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:38.399> don't<00:00:39.360> know

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
just does it work or not I don't know

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.150 
just does it work or not I don't know
yet<00:00:39.719> if<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:40.050> works<00:00:40.230> because<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.680> just<00:00:40.890> went<00:00:41.010> in

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
yet if it works because I just went in

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.420 
yet if it works because I just went in
one<00:00:41.399> time<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.570> was<00:00:42.719> not<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:43.620> long<00:00:43.860> ago<00:00:43.890> so

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
one time and it was not that long ago so

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.010 
one time and it was not that long ago so
it<00:00:44.550> takes<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.820> while<00:00:44.850> for<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.239> fat<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.600> actually

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
it takes a while for the fat to actually

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.709 
it takes a while for the fat to actually
flush<00:00:46.320> out<00:00:46.530> of<00:00:46.739> your<00:00:46.860> body<00:00:47.070> basically<00:00:47.969> I'm

of<00:03:36.610> working<00:03:36.760> I<00:03:37.180> don't<00:03:37.630> know<00:03:37.810> yeah<00:03:38.350> I<00:03:38.380> think<00:03:38.590> it

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
of working I don't know yeah I think it

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.500 
of working I don't know yeah I think it
takes<00:03:38.980> more<00:03:39.190> time<00:03:39.400> for<00:03:39.459> me<00:03:39.760> to<00:03:39.880> completely<00:03:40.239> get

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
takes more time for me to completely get

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.090 
takes more time for me to completely get
rid<00:03:40.540> of<00:03:40.750> things<00:03:40.930> out<00:03:41.260> of<00:03:41.320> my<00:03:41.560> body<00:03:41.739> so<00:03:42.040> I'm

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
rid of things out of my body so I'm

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.740 
rid of things out of my body so I'm
trying<00:03:42.340> to<00:03:42.400> drink<00:03:42.910> a<00:03:42.970> ton<00:03:43.090> of<00:03:43.150> water<00:03:43.269> which<00:03:43.630> I

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
trying to drink a ton of water which I

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.330 
trying to drink a ton of water which I
always<00:03:43.930> do<00:03:44.110> and<00:03:44.380> eat<00:03:44.650> a<00:03:44.680> little<00:03:44.860> cleaner

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
always do and eat a little cleaner

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.759 
always do and eat a little cleaner
um<00:03:46.410> but<00:03:47.459> more<00:03:48.459> than<00:03:48.580> anything<00:03:49.410> it's<00:03:50.410> a<00:03:50.590> very

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
um but more than anything it's a very

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.289 
um but more than anything it's a very
targeted<00:03:51.040> area<00:03:51.610> and<00:03:51.850> it's<00:03:51.970> somewhere<00:03:52.239> that

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
targeted area and it's somewhere that

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.199 
targeted area and it's somewhere that
normally<00:03:53.250> cumulates<00:03:54.250> fat<00:03:54.580> and<00:03:54.850> you<00:03:54.940> can't

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
normally cumulates fat and you can't

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:56.610 
normally cumulates fat and you can't
necessarily<00:03:55.360> when<00:03:56.019> you're<00:03:56.170> losing<00:03:56.500> weight

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
necessarily when you're losing weight

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.160 
necessarily when you're losing weight
like<00:03:56.769> spot<00:03:57.130> reduce<00:03:57.430> so<00:03:58.000> that's<00:03:58.299> why<00:03:58.570> you<00:03:58.630> can't

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
like spot reduce so that's why you can't

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.590 
like spot reduce so that's why you can't
kind<00:03:59.410> of<00:03:59.530> tell<00:03:59.739> if<00:04:00.010> this<00:04:00.190> works<00:04:00.430> versus<00:04:00.940> other

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
kind of tell if this works versus other

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.920
