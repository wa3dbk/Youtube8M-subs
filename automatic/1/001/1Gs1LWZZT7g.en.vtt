right so I don't confuse everyone now
you<00:00:33.450> can<00:00:33.600> connect<00:00:33.989> them<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.290> know<00:00:34.380> how<00:00:34.530> you

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
you can connect them you know how you

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.139 
you can connect them you know how you
connect<00:00:34.980> them<00:00:35.100> like<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:35.430> if<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:35.790> connect

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
connect them like this if you connect

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.590 
connect them like this if you connect
them<00:00:36.239> like<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.719> like<00:00:36.989> if<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.350> have<00:00:38.600> to

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
them like that like if you have to

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.220 
them like that like if you have to
already<00:00:40.050> connected<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.280> then<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.700> have<00:00:41.879> like

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
already connected and then you have like

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.770 
already connected and then you have like
one<00:00:43.230> close<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.070> like<00:00:44.250> really<00:00:45.030> close<00:00:45.329> like

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
one close to it like really close like

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.090 
one close to it like really close like
and<00:00:47.629> so<00:00:48.629> this<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:49.020> closed<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.620> can<00:00:49.770> connect

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
and so this is closed so you can connect

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.619 
and so this is closed so you can connect
it<00:00:50.190> like<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.700> you'll<00:00:50.850> see<00:00:51.090> why<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.360> has

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
it like that and you'll see why it has

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.200 
it like that and you'll see why it has
to<00:00:51.750> be<00:00:51.809> closed<00:00:52.199> because<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.489> know<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.940> can't

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
to be closed because you know you can't

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.819 
to be closed because you know you can't
replace<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.780> with<00:00:54.870> an<00:00:54.989> unsub<00:00:55.379> lawyer<00:00:55.620> because

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
replace it with an unsub lawyer because

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.500 
replace it with an unsub lawyer because
there's<00:00:56.190> no<00:00:56.340> one<00:00:56.489> solved<00:00:56.789> bladers<00:00:57.090> up<00:00:57.270> there

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
there's no one solved bladers up there

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.369 
there's no one solved bladers up there
what<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.350> got<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.530> do<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:59.300> got<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.449> put<00:01:00.690> an

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
what you got to do is got to put an

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.939 
what you got to do is got to put an
unsub<00:01:02.010> like<00:01:02.250> up<00:01:02.879> there<00:01:03.329> from<00:01:03.870> here<00:01:04.290> like<00:01:04.619> that

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
unsub like up there from here like that

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.210 
unsub like up there from here like that
and<00:01:05.309> then<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.360> connect<00:01:06.920> what<00:01:07.920> does<00:01:08.070> enhance

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
and then you connect what does enhance

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.039 
and then you connect what does enhance
be<00:01:08.460> close<00:01:08.640> okay<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.090> then<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.330> connect<00:01:09.750> yours

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
be close okay so then you connect yours

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.469 
be close okay so then you connect yours
say<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:10.950> have<00:01:11.189> edge<00:01:11.430> start<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.119> then<00:01:12.180> like

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
say you have edge start and then like

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.270 
say you have edge start and then like
the<00:01:12.659> other<00:01:12.840> ones<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.140> just<00:01:13.170> replace<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:13.950> with

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
the other ones you just replace it with

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.719 
the other ones you just replace it with
the<00:01:14.460> unsub<00:01:15.030> layer<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.950> fix<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.100> centers<00:01:17.460> like

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
the unsub layer and fix the centers like

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.539 
the unsub layer and fix the centers like
that<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:19.170> fit<00:01:19.350> up<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.500> salt<00:01:19.979> but<00:01:20.280> really

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
that and you fit up to salt but really

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.660 
that and you fit up to salt but really
you<00:01:20.670> only<00:01:20.759> got<00:01:21.090> one<00:01:21.979> just<00:01:22.979> got<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.250> replace

who are these two are set up and this

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.030 
who are these two are set up and this
need<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.700> be<00:01:38.850> going<00:01:39.000> right<00:01:39.420> here<00:01:40.040> remember

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
what you got to do is to place the top

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.560 
what you got to do is to place the top
with<00:01:43.079> an<00:01:43.170> unsolved<00:01:43.740> way<00:01:43.860> like<00:01:44.189> that<00:01:44.570> connect

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
with an unsolved way like that connect

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.450 
with an unsolved way like that connect
them<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:47.869> do<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:48.990> like<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.170> would<00:01:49.439> go<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.070> end

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
them and do it like you would go to end

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.999 
them and do it like you would go to end
sunlight<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.210> then<00:01:51.869> fix<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.439> centers<00:01:52.770> and

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
sunlight and then fix the centers and

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.410 
sunlight and then fix the centers and
then<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.220> can<00:01:53.399> only<00:01:53.490> have<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:54.350> UM<00:01:55.350> oh<00:01:56.270> well<00:01:57.270> on

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
then you can only have to UM oh well on

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.959 
then you can only have to UM oh well on
salt<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.079> this<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:58.950> explained<00:01:59.369> in<00:01:59.399> part<00:01:59.700> 3
