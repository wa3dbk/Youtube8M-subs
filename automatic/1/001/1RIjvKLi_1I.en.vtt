it<00:01:52.880> but<00:01:53.210> I<00:01:53.240> think<00:01:53.270> there's<00:01:53.539> some

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
it but I think there's some

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.410 
it but I think there's some
organizations<00:01:54.560> that<00:01:55.030> they're<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.179> reason

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
organizations that they're the reason

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.389 
organizations that they're the reason
why<00:01:56.750> it's<00:01:57.049> so<00:01:57.229> distant<00:01:57.679> you<00:01:57.859> know<00:01:57.979> I<00:01:58.100> think

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
why it's so distant you know I think

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.609 
why it's so distant you know I think
some<00:01:58.579> people<00:01:58.880> feel<00:01:59.090> like<00:01:59.270> it's<00:01:59.750> an<00:01:59.899> obligation

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
some people feel like it's an obligation

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.099 
some people feel like it's an obligation
that<00:02:00.649> you<00:02:00.890> have<00:02:01.039> to<00:02:01.219> speak<00:02:01.460> to<00:02:01.490> me<00:02:01.899> I'm<00:02:02.899> not

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:03.109 
that you have to speak to me I'm not

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:05.109 
that you have to speak to me I'm not
going<00:02:03.320> to<00:02:03.380> say<00:02:03.500> hi<00:02:03.649> to<00:02:03.710> you<00:02:03.829> or<00:02:04.159> if<00:02:04.579> I<00:02:04.700> say<00:02:04.850> hi<00:02:05.060> to

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
going to say hi to you or if I say hi to

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.910 
going to say hi to you or if I say hi to
you<00:02:05.240> it's<00:02:05.479> half<00:02:05.719> the<00:02:05.749> time<00:02:06.140> and<00:02:06.409> then<00:02:06.710> when<00:02:06.829> I'm

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
you it's half the time and then when I'm

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.980 
you it's half the time and then when I'm
with<00:02:07.039> my<00:02:07.070> clique<00:02:07.460> of<00:02:07.609> friends<00:02:07.640> I'm<00:02:08.210> I'm<00:02:08.810> not

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
with my clique of friends I'm I'm not

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.050 
with my clique of friends I'm I'm not
going<00:02:09.200> to<00:02:09.289> speak<00:02:09.500> so<00:02:10.070> I<00:02:10.130> think<00:02:10.220> a<00:02:10.490> lot<00:02:10.520> of<00:02:10.700> that

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
going to speak so I think a lot of that

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.150 
going to speak so I think a lot of that
is<00:02:11.410> just<00:02:12.410> the<00:02:12.650> reason<00:02:13.160> why<00:02:13.340> we're<00:02:13.940> so<00:02:14.210> distant

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
is just the reason why we're so distant

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.100 
is just the reason why we're so distant
separated<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:15.970> I<00:02:16.090> think<00:02:16.330> women<00:02:16.720> have<00:02:16.900> a

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
separated and I think women have a

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.170 
separated and I think women have a
tendency<00:02:17.200> to<00:02:17.890> just<00:02:18.070> not<00:02:18.250> like<00:02:18.520> another<00:02:18.880> female

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
tendency to just not like another female

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.270 
tendency to just not like another female
for<00:02:19.600> another<00:02:19.810> reason<00:02:20.110> that's<00:02:20.920> just<00:02:21.100> random

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
for another reason that's just random

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.220 
for another reason that's just random
for<00:02:21.820> talking<00:02:22.150> to<00:02:22.300> their<00:02:22.450> guy<00:02:22.660> friend<00:02:23.110> or

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
for talking to their guy friend or

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.940 
for talking to their guy friend or
whatever<00:02:23.440> and<00:02:24.090> I<00:02:25.090> just<00:02:25.420> think<00:02:25.660> that<00:02:25.950> people

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
whatever and I just think that people

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.710 
whatever and I just think that people
need<00:02:27.100> to<00:02:27.130> just<00:02:27.340> put<00:02:27.550> all<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:27.820> personal

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
need to just put all the personal

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.780 
need to just put all the personal
private<00:02:29.500> stuff<00:02:29.740> aside<00:02:30.040> and<00:02:30.340> just<00:02:30.370> get<00:02:30.640> to<00:02:30.670> know

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
private stuff aside and just get to know

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.150 
private stuff aside and just get to know
people<00:02:31.150> for<00:02:31.300> just<00:02:31.450> who<00:02:31.570> they<00:02:31.720> are<00:02:32.160> we've

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
people for just who they are we've

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.890 
people for just who they are we've
always<00:02:33.340> been<00:02:33.670> segregated<00:02:34.240> and<00:02:35.310> stratified

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
always been segregated and stratified

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.200 
always been segregated and stratified
there's<00:02:37.900> hierarchy<00:02:38.890> that<00:02:38.920> exists<00:02:39.490> within<00:02:39.670> the

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
there's hierarchy that exists within the

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.250 
there's hierarchy that exists within the
black<00:02:40.480> community<00:02:42.570> freshmen<00:02:43.570> come<00:02:43.840> into<00:02:44.140> it

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
black community freshmen come into it

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.410 
black community freshmen come into it
they're<00:02:44.500> very<00:02:44.710> standoffish<00:02:45.310> sometimes<00:02:46.150> I

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
they're very standoffish sometimes I

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.750 
they're very standoffish sometimes I
mean<00:02:46.750> it's<00:02:46.870> natural<00:02:47.230> tendency<00:02:47.680> to<00:02:47.760> gravitate

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
mean it's natural tendency to gravitate

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.480 
mean it's natural tendency to gravitate
towards<00:02:49.420> what<00:02:49.600> you<00:02:49.810> are<00:02:49.870> familiar<00:02:50.500> with<00:02:50.800> so

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
towards what you are familiar with so

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.780 
towards what you are familiar with so
you<00:02:51.550> often<00:02:51.790> see<00:02:52.120> what<00:02:52.330> people<00:02:52.630> do<00:02:52.810> is<00:02:53.790> people

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
you often see what people do is people

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.700 
you often see what people do is people
from<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.180> same<00:02:55.360> city<00:02:55.630> will<00:02:56.440> hang<00:02:56.590> out

from the same city will hang out

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.180 
from the same city will hang out
together<00:02:58.290> different<00:02:59.290> things<00:02:59.320> like<00:02:59.620> that<00:02:59.920> you

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
together different things like that you

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.490 
together different things like that you
know<00:03:00.640> you<00:03:00.790> kind<00:03:01.540> of<00:03:01.630> find<00:03:01.810> what<00:03:02.080> he's<00:03:02.200> a<00:03:02.230> group

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
know you kind of find what he's a group

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.710 
know you kind of find what he's a group
in<00:03:02.650> yourself<00:03:03.010> with<00:03:03.280> certain<00:03:03.700> people<00:03:04.030> but<00:03:04.690> I

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
in yourself with certain people but I

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.020 
in yourself with certain people but I
also<00:03:05.020> feel<00:03:05.380> like<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.740> community<00:03:06.250> here<00:03:06.670> has

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
also feel like the community here has

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.300 
also feel like the community here has
kind<00:03:07.720> of<00:03:07.840> turned<00:03:08.410> into<00:03:08.770> a<00:03:08.800> breeding<00:03:09.190> ground

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
kind of turned into a breeding ground

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.340 
kind of turned into a breeding ground
for<00:03:10.980> Greek<00:03:11.980> prospects<00:03:12.790> in<00:03:13.000> a<00:03:13.360> way<00:03:13.510> it<00:03:14.020> seems

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
for Greek prospects in a way it seems

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.260 
for Greek prospects in a way it seems
like<00:03:14.500> the<00:03:14.800> ultimate<00:03:15.130> goal<00:03:15.490> within<00:03:15.820> the<00:03:16.060> black

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
like the ultimate goal within the black

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.230 
like the ultimate goal within the black
community<00:03:16.300> is<00:03:17.020> to<00:03:17.710> get<00:03:17.890> within<00:03:18.160> that<00:03:18.520> crop<00:03:18.820> we

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240 
community is to get within that crop we

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.580 
community is to get within that crop we
don't<00:03:19.360> even<00:03:19.540> have<00:03:19.810> an<00:03:19.930> organization<00:03:20.500> on
