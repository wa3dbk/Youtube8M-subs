00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.700
 very good friends and friends of 5 x 1 who 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.650
 As you are, I bring you the analysis to 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.290
 mussi an application that you are going to 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.120
 find for free the appstore 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:17.240
 with which you will be able to listen to music 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.280
 in streaming just taken from youtube 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.260
 totally free form and without having 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.689
 to pay fees as they ask for services 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.460
 of music as spotify and so on let's 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.980
 get into muse and the first thing is 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.269
 register once to register one 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.849
 your account that was previously created 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.470
 you can access this menu if we give it 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:34.670
 in mus and we can see the options that 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.649
 gives us the application 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.140
 we will navigate quickly without 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.260
 delve into a lot of detail each menu 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.219
 the moore menu is for logically 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.410
 modify everything that concerns the 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:48.480
 options of our account the menu 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.059
 inbox I do not know specifically what it's for 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.710
 the friends menu is a menu with which 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.690
 we will be able to see the contacts that 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.270
 they also have an account with music to 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.500
 see his music I suppose et cetera and the 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.180
 main music screen where 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.370
 we can here see the songs 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.720
 that we have and the playlist button where 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.729
 we can create our lists 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.530
 of reproduction to order all 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.330
 our music, here we can 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.290
 create a playlist I for example I'm going to 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.210
 create a d 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.790
 for example bisbal let's put the 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.290
 main and once we believe this 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.090
 playlist in this way completely 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.830
 simple as you are seeing the only thing that 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.330
 we have to do is start now 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.009
 add music as we do 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.990
 we come to this menu and just 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.250
 we have to find the song that 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.539
 we want I'm not going to look for any 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.660
 song in particular but I will search 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:32.070
 the artist we give to look and I now 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.350
 Here I will give for example mismamente 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.700
 this song I give to the menu of at and this 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.130
 song has been added to my list 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.960
 main songs of agreement here 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.910
 he simply selected it and we could 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.289
 see how is the playback menu that 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.110
 it's aesthetically pretty nice where 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:48.720
 we have the menu to move forward and backward 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.429
 even less to share one if this 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.690
 song we want to pass to a 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:53.550
 list that we have created as per 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.659
 example of bisbal we simply have 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.060
 what to give there 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.119
 there would be to edit the liter here and 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.710
 just here in the import bar 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.689
 songs we simply have to choose 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.200
 what song or songs do we want 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.609
 to import 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.049
 I'm going to for example select this 

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:08.429
 that is some but we could care 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.349
 several at a time do not need to 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.910
 let's go 1 we give to import and 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.709
 automatically that song would come out 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.230
 in our list of bisbal that we just 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.629
 to create as you see is an application 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.060
 I think simple useful but that is going to 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.769
 like many that you like that of 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.900
 listen to music on the street since this 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.670
 it will simply consume your data 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.870
 mobile as you see also works 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.549
 perfectly in multitasking and 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.040
 we can control from our control 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.239
 center because it is an application that 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.650
 they like it also because as I said 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.450
 at the beginning it's an application that you go 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.799
 to find for free in the app 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.599
 store in the description I leave you the 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.709
