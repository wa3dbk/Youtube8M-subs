 strong wind a lot of kiters 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.140
 and in general this place is perfect for 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.260
 kitesurfing all over the world is the most 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.060
 popular place because here because 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.580
 this season will be a very strong wind without 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.710
 change and here is shallow 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.650
 if you ride you can not know 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.900
 flowed reefs or you and you will be all 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.170
 just to the waist a very safe place and 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.270
 the wind is constantly blowing but there is 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.570
 reef as if because we break 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:38.600
 the waves I may need to tidy up there 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:42.170
 is the depth of the belt on 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.150
 somewhere here quietly standing here like 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.159
 a train 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.110
 there on the mountain is such a gorgeous 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:47.590
 villas can be filmed about them with video 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.840
 anwar 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.610
 walked showed only worth how there 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:57.280
 all inside the video you can see here 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:59.140
 here along the coastline of this beach 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.159
 stretched numerous small 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.040
 otelchiki 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:06.010
 and there are also restaurants here and 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.060
 bars but mostly there is a lot of space 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.060
 occupy kite school 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.160
 there is a series of schools many kiters and 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:21.270
 lies like this they are folded here scooter 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:25.380
 schools and small small buildings 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.380
 instructor's boards are sitting 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.210
 here I am a nato girl 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.860
 she starts learning from her very small 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.900
 kite look at all 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.240
 the little one had to learn to manage 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.940
 them by 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.420
 fell remember which palm trees were on white 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.420
 beach 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.670
 look what they do not cut here 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.040
 over above the beach but rather almost straight 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.740
 because the wind is very, very strong 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.550
 straightens like this instructor help 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.550
 run kaydy 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:20.500
 here we are gone the end of the beach here 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:25.260
 significantly less kiters here fits 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:27.510
 By the end, and in general when they were in Mui 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.430
 he is no technique there either 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.250
 a lot of them but not so strong there 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:35.220
 the wind was when we were there and we were there 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.110
 You can take training as which 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.060
 girl skated recently you show 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.690
 he trained a little pony there and fell 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.910
 water that's all that managed to do it 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.830
 test from the boy and the fluidity 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.730
 manage and then the whole week was gone 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:52.530
 wind so we did not have time to learn 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:55.590
 if you want to learn kitesurfing then 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:58.620
 you have at least one week 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:03.330
 that the course lasts about 8 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:06.200
 hours a day it's about an hour and a half and on 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.200
 it will take a whole week 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.139
 and this 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:23.270
 apparatus 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:25.479
 we have reached the end of the beach 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.479
 hysterical 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:29.800
 and now we come to this rock i 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:34.060
 some we have not been 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:35.080
 there is some song like this 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:39.960
 lives on this 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:43.710
 the house is worth it is written that the entrance costs 50 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.710
 entrance fee verte 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:53.919
 Here is such a wonderful view 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:56.190
 Help me this all blows over the whole 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:06:00.400
 gusty guy 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:02.319
 huge beach a lot of hackers there hotel and 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.349
 By the way, here you are 

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:07.750
 there are guys right on the belt and very 

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:09.879
 far from shore as we said it 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:12.310
 one of the reasons why this beach believe myself 

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:15.009
 best for kite surfing 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:17.669
 also we all windsurfers rides on 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:17.669
 sails 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:28.020
 if reality or wind is not easy 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:29.610
 often that all surrender probably air so 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.810
 I do not believe that on the other side of the island 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.770
 there is a white beach 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:39.150
 no wind at all sunbathe swim 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:41.720
 here is unrealistic extreme ah 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:45.410
 you can relax 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:51.570
 gambok is hanging on this 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:55.700
 like this we do it blows well with the breeze 

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:55.700
 and lie down rest 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.919
 we are coming to the very end to the very 

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:11.250
 the edge of this this small island 

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:11.250
 look how beautiful 

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:21.060
