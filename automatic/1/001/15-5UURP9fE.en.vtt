00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.060
 now 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.080
 no way 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.840
 nothing else 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.689
 we are in the famous mouse trading in 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.950
 west hollywood just to one side 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.050
 of sunset boulevard in los angeles 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.880
 california to handle one of the 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.650
 latest releases of the brand 's 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.450
 blue oval we've been waiting for 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.800
 this for several months since the year 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.480
 last we saw the first pictures 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.949
 we had an approach and a 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.870
 very interesting approach to the new 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:41.460
 master but just now came the 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.989
 time to manage what we do 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.239
 us because we are going to handle all the 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.650
 day the two versions of the monsters and 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.019
 there are going to be very interesting things here 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.699
 in the angels the sixth generation of 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.500
 this succulent coupe arrives to follow 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.210
 conquering customers especially if 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.760
 we consider that at the moment they have more 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.729
 musts 9.2 million sold in 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.339
 More than 120 countries around the world 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:04.019
 also this 2014 show with 350 years 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:05.760
 in the market and celebrates it with a 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.860
 special edition of introduction of the 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.690
 new model in the gt variant that 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.600
 maintains the same of 8 of 5 liters but 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.670
 now with 435 horses and with option to 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.310
 a manual or automatic box of 6 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.260
 speeds however the novelty is not 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.090
 the most powerful version or the known b6 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.070
 of 300 horses but the new model 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.210
 intermediate of the range the first four 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.680
 cylinders in the monster since 1969 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.910
 mexico and in fact it is thought to 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.070
 meet the strict standards of 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.660
 emissions in europe is not about 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.330
 four cylinder common is the novel 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.100
 what turbo bus of 2.3 liters and 310 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.900
 same horsepower that we have 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.280
 tested on other models so the 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.900
 behavior of this new plant 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.250
 power is outstanding but we must 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.470
 admit that our sound that we 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.180
 it fascinates to hear how much they were 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.950
 had to resort to improving this 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.990
 roar through the horns of 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.760
 sound equipment so that when driving not 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.900
 we lack this character that at least 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.120
 psychologically we are always 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.260
 looking will also be for the first time 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.270
 the history the rear suspension 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.460
 independent which results in a 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.840
 Better quality of walking comfort and 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.880
 greater stability the step by curve 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.040
 meanwhile the interior improves 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.540
 radically in finishes and materials and 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.010
 the level of equipment is much higher 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.870
 to any mustang seen with 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.430
 prior the complete system of 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.380
 Infotainment includes modes of 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.660
 driving configuration both the track 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.550
 apps like the selector the drive mode that 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.200
 can be set in the nou web mode 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.480
 that is to say for a wet road or with 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.040
 snow in track mode for a track in 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.990
 sport plus mode for the best performance 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.000
 dynamic and of course in a mode of 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.709
 normal driving these options are 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.620
 configurable and management according to the 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.569
 circumstances 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.549
 and also has a new launch system 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.260
 control that allows us to start as 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:39.730
 if it were a competition circuit 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.650
 the line system what can block 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.849
 the front discs to burn 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.860
 rims without forcing the rear brakes 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.360
 in this way we get the best 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.220
 temperature for the rear tires 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.260
 and try to get the best times 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.239
 in a snatch for example in the 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.159
 quarter mile and generate the management is 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.200
 pretty balanced responsive and very 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:57.340
 agile while smaller the engine better 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.079
 the curves react 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.150
 but in general it is the mustang that best 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.590
 it handles history and so 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.629
 We finished our management program 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.910
 new bring people here in west 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.829
 hollywood in los angeles california a 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.629
 very interesting car that left us with 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:12.700
 excellent sensations in this version 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:15.190
 v8 and show people at the top of the range 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.629
 but above all more attractive and 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.010
 interesting the four version 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:21.760
 turbo cylinders with the new ecoboost 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.900
 2.3 liters of 310 horsepower a 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.609
 car 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.200
 much better done better quality good 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:28.480
 handling feels light even in 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.310
 four- cylinder version if what 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.190
 you are looking for is a sports car 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.519
 a striking current attractive coupe and 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.049
 that can even save fuel 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:40.859
 we are definitely going to 2015 is 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:40.859
 an option to consider
