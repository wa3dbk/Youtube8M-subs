00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 vicente padilla launched an entry and two 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.700
 thirds to sign up their first 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.350
 victory of the campaign since the medias 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.240
 Reds of Boston defeated 6 races 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.160
 for 4 to the rays of tampa bay 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.290
 vicente entered the game at the top 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.969
 of the sixth episode replacing 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.770
 code atkinson that he had left 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.050
 runners in first and second with a 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.000
 out the first batter he faced 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.070
 padilla went to desmond jennings and what 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.930
 he shot in this way to mark the 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.130
 second out of the inning after Carlos 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.439
 cliffs fail in this fly to the garden 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.849
 right and so vicente padilla dominated 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.830
 the two batters he faced in 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.719
 this inning the chinandegano launched the 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.880
 seventh episode and immediately dominated 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.010
 with this fly to the central garden to evan 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.690
 longoria later jeff keppinger 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.640
 he connected to this unhappy and is the 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.260
 short stops then he thought that he 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.180
 he connected this hit that hit the 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.190
 Nicaraguan but that was stopping at the hands of 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.050
 from Adrian Gonzalez this happened quickly 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.250
 the second base for without marking the 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.289
 second year 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.789
 the nica closed the episode by giving him 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.530
 this luke scott punch 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.449
 in this way padilla would close its 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.399
 acting from the mound since not 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.960
 it came out in the eighth episode but before 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.309
 the Red Sox had 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.860
 I managed to score a run in the 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.470
 bottom of the seventh episode with this 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.570
 quadrangular 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.730
 throughout the central garden of the 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.590
 maya avilés para díaz I remain with balance 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.830
 of a victory zero defeats with a 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.090
 luxurious effectiveness of 1.50 other 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.340
 Nicaraguan who saw action in the 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.350
 big leagues was wilton lopez who 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.180
 threw two tickets and two thirds in the 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.760
 Defeat of the Stars of Houston 5 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.620
 races for 4 against the marlins of miami 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.660
 wilton entered the game in the bottom 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.640
 the eighth replacing 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.680
 wesley wright who had left emilio 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.480
 bonifacio on first base the first 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.280
 hitter Lopez faced was halle 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.020
 ramírez that received it with this 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.729
 quadrangular all over garden 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.470
 central so that the team of 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.690
 marlins de miami will tie in the 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.700
 I find four annotations however 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.010
 the Nicaraguan this he replaced when prescribing 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.050
 this punch by shooting the fourth part of 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.729
 the marlins giancarlos stanton then 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.979
 dominated with this fly at the hands of the garden 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.200

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.880

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.930
 but the nica closed the eighth episode 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.540
 dominating with this hit to the third 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.100
 base gaby sanchez worship would begin the 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.440
 dover episode dominating with this hit 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.330

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.130
 lopez dominated chris coghlan with this one 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.780
 ground ball to second baseman 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.850

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.730
 master the way of strikes to jean 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.410
 Carlos is so much to get the first and 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.330
 the last batter he faced was 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.190
 omar infant here in dominoes with this 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.990

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.450
 give the mound of heart attacks to 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.400
 dedicate ignite the Nicaraguan left 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.380
