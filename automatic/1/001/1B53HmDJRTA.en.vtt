and by the way I'm gonna be doing them

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.580 
and by the way I'm gonna be doing them
on<00:00:19.859> mattresses<00:00:20.869> yeah<00:00:21.869> this<00:00:22.140> one's<00:00:22.289> upside

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
on mattresses yeah this one's upside

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.790 
on mattresses yeah this one's upside
down<00:00:22.740> I<00:00:23.039> took<00:00:23.550> them<00:00:23.640> off<00:00:23.730> my<00:00:23.939> bed<00:00:24.560> as<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:25.650> can

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
down I took them off my bed as you can

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.019 
down I took them off my bed as you can
see<00:00:25.980> these<00:00:26.400> are<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.609> boards

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
see these are the boards

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.939 
see these are the boards
that's<00:00:27.330> why<00:00:27.630> because<00:00:28.050> if<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:28.320> jump<00:00:28.590> on<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.800> bed

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
that's why because if I jump on the bed

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.690 
that's why because if I jump on the bed
these<00:00:29.160> boards<00:00:29.490> are<00:00:29.580> snapping<00:00:29.910> up<00:00:30.050> so<00:00:31.050> okay<00:00:31.700> sit

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
these boards are snapping up so okay sit

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:55.720 
these boards are snapping up so okay sit
straight

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.209 

a<00:00:56.730> lot<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:57.989> learn<00:00:58.320> when<00:00:58.649> you're<00:00:58.770> little

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
a lot of you learn when you're little

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.420 
a lot of you learn when you're little
kids<00:00:59.629> but<00:01:00.629> if<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.230> don't<00:01:01.410> know<00:01:01.559> how<00:01:01.829> this<00:01:02.190> is

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
kids but if you don't know how this is

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.320 
kids but if you don't know how this is
what<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:03.890> whoa<00:01:04.890> that's<00:01:05.729> all<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.090> have<00:01:06.180> to

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
what it is whoa that's all you have to

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.690 
what it is whoa that's all you have to
do<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:07.409> just<00:01:08.250> rolling<00:01:08.820> why<00:01:09.750> do<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.960> do<00:01:10.080> sums<00:01:10.350> up

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
do so just rolling why do you do sums up

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.350 
do so just rolling why do you do sums up
okay<00:01:12.229> the<00:01:13.229> next<00:01:13.680> step<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:14.159> after<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:15.180> get

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
okay the next step is after you get

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.280 
okay the next step is after you get
yourself<00:01:16.049> back<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:17.070> step<00:01:17.280> 2<00:01:17.630> you<00:01:18.630> do<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:18.990> front

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
yourself back to step 2 you do a front

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.429 
yourself back to step 2 you do a front
handspring<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.640> this<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.600> demonstration<00:01:21.990> of

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
handspring so this is a demonstration of

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.710 
handspring so this is a demonstration of
a<00:01:22.920> front<00:01:23.159> handspring<00:01:26.420> that's<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.540> front

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
a front handspring that's a front

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.690 
a front handspring that's a front
handspring<00:01:28.080> I'm<00:01:28.439> not<00:01:28.650> too<00:01:28.799> bad<00:01:29.009> because<00:01:29.369> I

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
handspring I'm not too bad because I

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.910 
handspring I'm not too bad because I
don't<00:01:29.759> practice<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.479> lot<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:31.020> just<00:01:31.290> it's

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
don't practice this a lot I just it's

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.260 
don't practice this a lot I just it's
just<00:01:31.979> something<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.460> know<00:01:32.520> how<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.820> do<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:34.020> yeah

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
just something I know how to do so yeah

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.719 
just something I know how to do so yeah
and<00:01:36.270> then<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.600> third<00:01:36.869> step<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.470> do<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:38.159> front

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
and then the third step is to do a front

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.090 
and then the third step is to do a front
flip<00:01:39.020> without<00:01:40.790> hitting<00:01:41.790> any<00:01:42.240> type<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.689> bounce

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
flip without hitting any type of bounce

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.399 
flip without hitting any type of bounce
so<00:01:45.439> what's<00:01:46.439> in<00:01:46.590> our<00:01:46.680> hands

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
so what's in our hands

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.380 
so what's in our hands
so<00:01:49.340> that's<00:01:50.119> the<00:01:50.360> third<00:01:50.570> step<00:01:50.899> and<00:01:52.149> the<00:01:53.149> fourth

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
so that's the third step and the fourth

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.380 
so that's the third step and the fourth
step<00:01:53.719> is<00:01:54.200> to<00:01:54.500> do<00:01:54.649> it<00:01:54.799> with<00:01:55.159> bounce<00:01:55.460> without

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
step is to do it with bounce without

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.310 
step is to do it with bounce without
pants

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
pants

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.389 
pants
so<00:01:58.180> in<00:01:59.180> the<00:01:59.299> bounce<00:01:59.509> and<00:01:59.840> if<00:02:00.710> you<00:02:00.950> want<00:02:01.159> to<00:02:01.280> go

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
so in the bounce and if you want to go

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.160 
so in the bounce and if you want to go
when<00:02:01.610> I'm<00:02:01.700> bouncing<00:02:02.119> on<00:02:02.210> I'm<00:02:02.570> not<00:02:02.750> bouncing<00:02:03.079> on

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
when I'm bouncing on I'm not bouncing on

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.859 
when I'm bouncing on I'm not bouncing on
the<00:02:03.890> mattresses<00:02:04.399> I'm<00:02:05.060> bouncing<00:02:05.450> on<00:02:05.570> an
