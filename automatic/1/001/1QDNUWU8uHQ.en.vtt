black<00:01:45.039> leather<00:01:45.399> and<00:01:45.880> back<00:01:46.479> then<00:01:46.780> i<00:01:47.050> wore<00:01:47.289> a<00:01:47.319> lot

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
black leather and back then i wore a lot

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.539 
black leather and back then i wore a lot
of<00:01:48.240> silver<00:01:49.240> and<00:01:49.479> white<00:01:49.780> gold<00:01:50.050> now<00:01:50.710> I'm<00:01:50.950> are<00:01:51.399> you

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
of silver and white gold now I'm are you

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:53.490 
of silver and white gold now I'm are you
typically<00:01:52.000> wear<00:01:52.180> yellow<00:01:52.479> gold<00:01:52.840> but<00:01:53.200> back<00:01:53.470> then

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
typically wear yellow gold but back then

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.490 
typically wear yellow gold but back then
I<00:01:53.740> was<00:01:53.979> always<00:01:54.100> wearing<00:01:54.399> silver<00:01:55.240> so<00:01:55.780> that's

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
I was always wearing silver so that's

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.560 
I was always wearing silver so that's
why<00:01:56.680> I<00:01:56.710> got<00:01:56.890> that<00:01:57.100> color<00:01:57.340> combination<00:01:58.090> I<00:01:58.329> think

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
why I got that color combination I think

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.389 
why I got that color combination I think
if<00:01:58.659> I<00:01:58.780> was<00:01:58.930> to<00:01:59.079> buy<00:01:59.200> this<00:01:59.259> bag<00:01:59.619> again<00:02:00.040> right<00:02:00.369> now

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
if I was to buy this bag again right now

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:02.130 
if I was to buy this bag again right now
I<00:02:00.579> would<00:02:01.000> definitely<00:02:01.149> go<00:02:01.509> with<00:02:01.540> yellow<00:02:01.810> gold

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
I would definitely go with yellow gold

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.170 
I would definitely go with yellow gold
but<00:02:02.469> it<00:02:02.979> doesn't<00:02:03.340> really<00:02:03.399> bother<00:02:03.520> me<00:02:03.850> much

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
but it doesn't really bother me much

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.179 
but it doesn't really bother me much
anymore<00:02:04.390> that<00:02:04.869> I<00:02:04.899> do<00:02:04.990> wear<00:02:05.350> yellow<00:02:05.500> gold<00:02:05.860> and

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
anymore that I do wear yellow gold and

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.789 
anymore that I do wear yellow gold and
then<00:02:06.719> use<00:02:07.719> this<00:02:07.899> bad<00:02:08.140> just<00:02:08.410> because<00:02:08.530> I<00:02:08.769> feel

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:08.799 
then use this bad just because I feel

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:11.100 
then use this bad just because I feel
like<00:02:08.979> it's<00:02:09.160> such<00:02:09.310> a<00:02:09.340> classic<00:02:09.579> and<00:02:10.060> you<00:02:10.959> can

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
like it's such a classic and you can

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.100 
like it's such a classic and you can
always<00:02:11.380> mix<00:02:11.590> metals<00:02:12.010> so<00:02:12.630> that's<00:02:13.630> the<00:02:13.750> story<00:02:13.930> on

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
always mix metals so that's the story on

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.680 
always mix metals so that's the story on
that<00:02:14.140> it's<00:02:14.620> actually<00:02:14.980> a<00:02:15.010> fairly<00:02:15.250> big<00:02:15.640> bag<00:02:16.180> I
