other pension benefit programs i just

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.270 
other pension benefit programs i just
keep<00:02:28.240> interest<00:02:28.600> rates<00:02:28.690> at<00:02:28.900> zero<00:02:28.930> which<00:02:29.920> is<00:02:29.950> the

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
keep interest rates at zero which is the

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.250 
keep interest rates at zero which is the
same<00:02:30.430> thing<00:02:30.490> they<00:02:31.000> don't<00:02:31.180> need<00:02:31.270> to<00:02:31.510> formally

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
same thing they don't need to formally

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.110 
same thing they don't need to formally
get<00:02:32.710> rid<00:02:32.980> of<00:02:33.010> these<00:02:33.220> programs<00:02:33.460> they<00:02:33.850> just<00:02:34.000> keep

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
get rid of these programs they just keep

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.120 
get rid of these programs they just keep
interest<00:02:34.420> rates<00:02:34.510> at<00:02:34.750> zero<00:02:34.780> so<00:02:35.680> that<00:02:35.920> the

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
interest rates at zero so that the

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.410 
interest rates at zero so that the
amount<00:02:36.520> of<00:02:36.610> interest<00:02:36.850> being<00:02:37.060> paid<00:02:37.240> out<00:02:37.390> by

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
amount of interest being paid out by

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.060 
amount of interest being paid out by
these<00:02:37.570> programs<00:02:37.960> is<00:02:38.080> zero<00:02:38.440> so<00:02:38.710> it's

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
these programs is zero so it's

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.530 
these programs is zero so it's
effectively<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.550> same<00:02:39.580> thing<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:40.240> people

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
effectively the same thing the people

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.390 
effectively the same thing the people
are<00:02:40.600> going<00:02:40.720> to<00:02:40.840> be<00:02:40.960> deprived<00:02:41.380> of<00:02:41.400> income

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.790 
are going to be deprived of income
enough<00:02:43.240> to<00:02:43.390> keep<00:02:43.510> themselves<00:02:43.750> a<00:02:44.230> living<00:02:44.650> to
