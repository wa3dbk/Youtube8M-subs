it's nice and big so i decided to go
with<00:01:37.619> this<00:01:37.950> case<00:01:38.280> because<00:01:38.790> it's<00:01:39.030> not<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.240> hard

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
with this case because it's not a hard

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.480 
with this case because it's not a hard
case<00:01:39.840> I've<00:01:40.170> had<00:01:40.439> our<00:01:40.590> cases<00:01:40.920> on<00:01:41.009> phones<00:01:41.280> before

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
case I've had our cases on phones before

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.920 
case I've had our cases on phones before
and<00:01:42.030> it'll<00:01:42.420> scratch<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.200> edges<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.740> phone

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
and it'll scratch the edges of the phone

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.270 
and it'll scratch the edges of the phone
so<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:45.990> went<00:01:46.140> with<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.320> softer<00:01:46.770> case<00:01:46.979> so<00:01:47.250> it

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
so I went with a softer case so it

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.770 
so I went with a softer case so it
didn't<00:01:47.610> scratch<00:01:47.970> out<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.149> edges<00:01:48.299> of<00:01:48.509> my<00:01:48.540> phone

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
didn't scratch out the edges of my phone

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.810 
didn't scratch out the edges of my phone
so<00:01:48.990> much<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.890> here's<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.130> close<00:01:50.430> look<00:01:50.640> at<00:01:50.790> the

so much so here's a close look at the
case<00:01:51.119> has<00:01:51.630> this<00:01:52.020> pixilation<00:01:52.920> on<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.640> back<00:01:53.850> for

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.810 
case has this pixilation on the back for
extra<00:01:54.450> grip<00:01:54.659> I<00:01:55.049> know<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.680> iPhone<00:01:55.979> 5<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.219> pretty

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
extra grip I know the iPhone 5 is pretty

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.560 
extra grip I know the iPhone 5 is pretty
slick<00:01:57.799> so<00:01:58.799> this<00:01:58.979> gives<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.399> some<00:02:00.030> nice<00:02:00.180> extra

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
slick so this gives it some nice extra

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.050 
slick so this gives it some nice extra
grip<00:02:00.750> so<00:02:01.680> let<00:02:01.770> me<00:02:01.799> go<00:02:01.920> ahead<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.159> just<00:02:02.250> set<00:02:02.939> my

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
grip so let me go ahead and just set my

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.639 
grip so let me go ahead and just set my
iphone<00:02:03.509> inside<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.469> case<00:02:05.960> okay<00:02:06.960> hey<00:02:07.469> that

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
iphone inside the case okay hey that

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.609 
iphone inside the case okay hey that
went<00:02:07.799> in<00:02:07.890> very<00:02:08.160> easily<00:02:09.080> so<00:02:10.080> as<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.259> can<00:02:10.410> see

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
went in very easily so as you can see

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.460 
went in very easily so as you can see
here<00:02:11.069> it's<00:02:11.610> raised<00:02:12.120> around<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.629> edges

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
here it's raised around the edges

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.130 
here it's raised around the edges
so<00:02:13.590> that<00:02:13.710> way<00:02:13.800> you<00:02:13.860> can<00:02:14.040> sit<00:02:14.250> your<00:02:14.400> iphone<00:02:14.730> down

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
so that way you can sit your iphone down

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.900 
so that way you can sit your iphone down
face<00:02:16.140> down<00:02:16.170> without<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.130> screen<00:02:17.490> touching

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
face down without the screen touching

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.760 
face down without the screen touching
whatever<00:02:18.180> surface<00:02:18.450> you<00:02:18.720> set<00:02:18.990> it<00:02:19.140> down<00:02:19.260> on<00:02:20.360> so

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
whatever surface you set it down on so

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.790 
you keep your app in and now that I have
an<00:03:04.500> egg<00:03:04.680> in<00:03:04.709> a<00:03:04.980> case<00:03:05.870> but<00:03:06.870> yeah<00:03:07.050> I<00:03:07.080> really<00:03:07.680> like

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
an egg in a case but yeah I really like

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.180 
an egg in a case but yeah I really like
this<00:03:08.070> case<00:03:08.310> actually<00:03:09.350> the<00:03:10.350> edges<00:03:10.709> right<00:03:10.860> here

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
this case actually the edges right here

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.970 
this case actually the edges right here
there's<00:03:11.970> that<00:03:12.180> kind<00:03:12.390> of<00:03:12.510> lip<00:03:12.690> on<00:03:12.870> there<00:03:13.080> so<00:03:13.860> it

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
there's that kind of lip on there so it

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.479 
there's that kind of lip on there so it
actually<00:03:14.130> covers<00:03:15.110> this<00:03:16.110> diagonal<00:03:17.040> part<00:03:17.280> this

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
actually covers this diagonal part this

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.540 
actually covers this diagonal part this
trim<00:03:18.120> around<00:03:18.330> the<00:03:18.540> phone<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:19.370> then<00:03:20.370> that

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
trim around the phone and then that

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.550 
trim around the phone and then that
actually<00:03:21.060> provides<00:03:21.540> extra<00:03:22.050> grip<00:03:22.260> for<00:03:22.470> the

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
actually provides extra grip for the

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.979 
actually provides extra grip for the
case<00:03:22.769> it<00:03:23.459> actually<00:03:23.670> kind<00:03:24.030> of<00:03:24.239> curves<00:03:24.870> around

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
case it actually kind of curves around

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.620 
case it actually kind of curves around
your<00:03:25.260> phone<00:03:25.470> a<00:03:25.500> little<00:03:25.860> bit<00:03:26.209> well<00:03:27.209> yeah<00:03:27.360> that's

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630
