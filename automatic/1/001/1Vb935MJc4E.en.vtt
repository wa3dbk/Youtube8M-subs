00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:14.880
 muslim new mobile hard drive today 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:18.630
 based on the ifa and new is that we 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.390
 for the first time a 1 tbyte hard disk 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:25.470
 a metal city ​​cham 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.400
 that means worse than my father and 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:33.660
 my normal with my passport that is 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:35.790
 212 3 millimeters and of course that 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.219
 An extra protection for the metal 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.530
 hard disk is me of course 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.300
 with our latest 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:46.500
 Data backup software to the benchmark 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:49.140
 before and with each time do not happen 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.010
 only an automatic data backup 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.020
 set up 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.020
 You can also do one of the backup 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.640
 set up on a dock sound and 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.059
 conversely , one can also draw 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.690
 Set up potential here 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.549
 exactly and naturally you can do it with 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.210
 a password protect password 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.420
 protect 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:14.500
 that means he has 256 bits in klitzschen 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:18.930
 encrypted means no access 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.980
 knowing the data without the word 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:26.260
 and maybe an example of 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:28.570
 I have this software interface 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.480
 could also simply here 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.570
 my ipod 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:36.120
 bad to keep the data secure 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:42.210
 but as I said opposite I can here 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:45.560
 for example the boxee box us player 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.330
 I can choose now, too 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.930
 somehow here on one of these 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.030
 devices save the data backup and 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.010
 with her and it's just three 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.500
 and you have an automatic one 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.220
 continuous macbook or 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.220
 data security set up 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:26.630
 You do not necessarily have to do it 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:32.110
 maybe make a windows 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.110
 system additionally also the data
