00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.440 
Jaguar down pipe that goes on a European
Jaguar<00:02:17.599> we<00:02:18.409> weld<00:02:18.680> it<00:02:18.890> in<00:02:19.040> oxygen<00:02:19.819> sensor<00:02:20.209> bugs

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
Jaguar we weld it in oxygen sensor bugs

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.660 
Jaguar we weld it in oxygen sensor bugs
here<00:02:20.959> and<00:02:21.170> that's<00:02:21.530> where<00:02:21.680> our<00:02:21.709> oxygen<00:02:22.250> sensors

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
here and that's where our oxygen sensors

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.020 
here and that's where our oxygen sensors
are<00:02:22.879> and<00:02:23.780> we<00:02:23.900> come<00:02:24.110> back<00:02:24.430> we've<00:02:25.430> wrapped<00:02:25.700> back

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
are and we come back we've wrapped back

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.750 
are and we come back we've wrapped back
to<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.299> cat<00:02:26.540> keep<00:02:26.989> it<00:02:27.140> cool<00:02:27.799> and<00:02:28.159> we<00:02:28.610> have<00:02:28.730> a

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
to the cat keep it cool and we have a

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:36.520 
to the cat keep it cool and we have a
pot<00:02:29.060> coming<00:02:29.360> back<00:02:29.569> to<00:02:29.720> the<00:02:29.840> cat's<00:02:35.530> catalytic

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
pot coming back to the cat's catalytic

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.080 
pot coming back to the cat's catalytic
converters<00:02:37.069> we<00:02:37.340> put<00:02:37.549> a<00:02:38.049> crossover<00:02:39.049> pipe<00:02:39.379> here

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
converters we put a crossover pipe here

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.319 
converters we put a crossover pipe here
and<00:02:41.290> then<00:02:42.290> we<00:02:42.470> have<00:02:42.709> dumps<00:02:43.549> here<00:02:43.819> where<00:02:44.030> we<00:02:44.180> can

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
and then we have dumps here where we can

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.710 
and then we have dumps here where we can
run<00:02:44.510> it<00:02:44.890> open<00:02:45.890> exhaust<00:02:46.280> if<00:02:46.519> we'd<00:02:46.670> like<00:02:46.849> to<00:02:47.090> and

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
run it open exhaust if we'd like to and

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.220 
run it open exhaust if we'd like to and
then<00:02:47.900> we<00:02:47.989> go<00:02:48.109> back<00:02:48.139> to<00:02:48.349> stock<00:02:48.799> up<00:02:49.099> over<00:02:50.230> and

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
then we go back to stock up over and

then we go back to stock up over and
we've<00:02:51.500> got<00:02:51.650> stock<00:02:51.920> mufflers<00:02:52.400> so<00:02:52.579> the<00:02:52.700> only

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
we've got stock mufflers so the only

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:54.430 
we've got stock mufflers so the only
mufflers<00:02:53.329> we<00:02:53.450> got<00:02:53.629> are<00:02:53.750> their<00:02:53.870> resonators<00:02:54.409> and

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
mufflers we got are their resonators and

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.050 
mufflers we got are their resonators and
it's<00:02:54.769> still<00:02:54.950> pretty<00:02:54.980> quiet<00:02:55.459> it's<00:02:55.700> got<00:02:55.849> a<00:02:55.879> nice
