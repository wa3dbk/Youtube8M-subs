at<00:00:37.760> how<00:00:37.880> to<00:00:37.940> set<00:00:38.210> this<00:00:38.329> drill<00:00:38.600> up<00:00:38.780> you're<00:00:39.739> going

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
at how to set this drill up you're going

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:41.470 
at how to set this drill up you're going
to<00:00:39.890> start<00:00:40.160> by<00:00:40.220> taking<00:00:40.610> all<00:00:40.820> the<00:00:40.970> straps<00:00:41.239> and

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
to start by taking all the straps and

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.540 
to start by taking all the straps and
cinching<00:00:41.840> them<00:00:41.989> completely<00:00:42.470> down<00:00:42.829> you<00:00:43.399> want

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
cinching them completely down you want

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.950 
cinching them completely down you want
to<00:00:43.640> get<00:00:43.760> it<00:00:43.880> all<00:00:44.120> the<00:00:44.300> way<00:00:44.329> as<00:00:44.540> tight<00:00:44.780> as<00:00:44.930> you

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
to get it all the way as tight as you

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.549 
to get it all the way as tight as you
possibly<00:00:45.050> can<00:00:49.780> once<00:00:50.780> you<00:00:50.929> secure<00:00:51.350> those

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
possibly can once you secure those

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:53.069 
possibly can once you secure those
shoulder<00:00:51.949> straps<00:00:52.219> as<00:00:52.399> tight<00:00:52.579> as<00:00:52.730> they'll<00:00:52.910> go

restrictive<00:01:22.909> valve<00:01:23.090> up<00:01:23.270> here<00:01:23.540> what<00:01:23.990> I<00:01:24.020> do<00:01:24.170> is

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
restrictive valve up here what I do is

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.440 
restrictive valve up here what I do is
open<00:01:24.680> it<00:01:24.890> completely<00:01:25.460> on<00:01:25.640> the<00:01:26.060> bypass<00:01:26.390> valve

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
and suck in on the regulator to

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.910 
and suck in on the regulator to
disengage<00:01:28.700> that<00:01:28.729> valve<00:01:29.619> when<00:01:30.619> you<00:01:30.710> hear<00:01:30.890> it
