00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.590
 all of them 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.490
 as soon as 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.530
 that is today 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.600
 we'll talk about those few kilos that 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.360
 we took during the same one 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:21.240
 that I read what I read that I see in 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.270
 In other words, now there are no armed safeguards 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.669
 I eat larger from today on a strict diet 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.430
 ferra no this is wrong 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:31.050
 above all what we could have 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.120
 take it could be some water that 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.070
 I advise you to dispose of by eliminating 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.830
 maybe the salt is the fat you are 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.470
 accumulated and relatively little because 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.330
 in 2 3 days we can't 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.440
 increase in fat then like 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.269
 behave 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.489
 for example we can take in the morning 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:50.159
 glass of water with lemon though 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.600
 using a straw and do not sell 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:52.769
 directly so otherwise we go to 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.479
 ruin your teeth 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:57.619
 on the other hand important as I say 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:01:00.479
 always have breakfast and try to 

00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:01.799
 feed at least four five times 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:03.420
 per day 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:05.909
 then maybe someone thinks about eliminating 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.770
 completely pasta and carbohydrates of 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.560
 reduce because I have eaten 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.880
 so no carbohydrates go anyway 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.619
 taken maybe we have not pasta but 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.159
 other types of carbohydrates and I make you a 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.609
 example 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.320
 this is the aquino millet rice 

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:24.830
 complete and read the description 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.380
 because then I leave you anyway 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.280
 news in francs instead regarding the 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.500
 protein solution of the board of 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.370
 assume that of vegetable origin e 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.780
 maybe decrease red meat 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.400
 replacing it with white meat 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.640
 an example of vegetable proteins 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.640
 could be these pages of 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.680
 yours we go out if I show you 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.830
 black beans , vegetables and fruit 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.430
 they must never fail to be detached 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.870
 from main meals in such a way as to 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.010
 going to fill those holes in that 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.740
 we have during the day 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:03.140
 another product I can give you 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.350
 recommend the show and this one 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.619
 you see at multiple properties then one 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.980
 cup of green tea a day maybe at 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:16.160
 afternoon does very well by now you should 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.650
 know how the water drink so much water during 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.020
 the day when you feel not 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.000
 forced however the advice that 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.530
 I can give a little bottle in small 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.170
 born to sip during the day 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.150
 such as to dispose of those 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.209
 so that we took during these 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.950
 holidays physical activity we have been 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:38.180
 sitting we passed by a relative 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.470
 the other we are sitting so could 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.050
 be the starting point for or to start over 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.780
 to do to do activity 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.690
 physics that does not mean falling out of 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.239
 exercises now immediately a month I owe myself 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.760
 I have to settle it is not enough too 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.890
 go down for a walk 30 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.080
 minutes of walking per day sign up 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.590
 at the gym though doing things always 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.890
 gradually without killing the whole thing is 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:07.370
 immediately it never goes well and capitulates 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:10.340
 so what then is the activity to do 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.800
 physically eating at least regularly 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.610
 six meals a day drink plenty of water and 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.860
 don't get caught up in the lust for wanting 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.900
 lose weight and lose these pounds and in the 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.330
 a short time slowly i 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.860
 results will be obtained I hope to have 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.750
 said it all if I forgot 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.760
 something read the description as 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.980
