00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
punishments for that and so I decided to

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.020 
punishments for that and so I decided to
get<00:04:52.630> up<00:04:52.750> on<00:04:52.900> my<00:04:52.930> little<00:04:53.169> mouse<00:04:53.410> legs<00:04:53.740> and<00:04:54.070> go

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
tell this person and that resulted in

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.140 
tell this person and that resulted in
strangling<00:04:59.340> friends<00:05:00.340> and<00:05:00.460> a<00:05:00.490> family<00:05:00.729> was
