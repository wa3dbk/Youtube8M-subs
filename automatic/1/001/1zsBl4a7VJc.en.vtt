00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.800
My name is Kim Stanish

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.000
Courtney Odell

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.100
Christopher Quilici

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.400
and I'm a major here in Theatre

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.600
Studio Art

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.840
Music Ed Degree

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.080
I'm a BFA in Dance and a BA in Design

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.940
although originally I came as a science major

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.260
I wasn't happy and I was taking dance
classes on the side and finally my junior

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.280
year I switched to a Dance major
and my life changed

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.119
Western has a lot of options for
out-of-state students as far as

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:38.800
scholarships go and so I came here
and I've loved it ever since

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.890
class sizes are not tiny but
they're small enough that everyone

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.730
is seen and heard
I mean, when your dance classes have 20 people

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.710
and your Design classes have 20 people
you build a community every quarter

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.649
in your class.
I love how many opportunities we have

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.260
for performance. We have the opera
production, we have opera scenes, aria

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.760
competitions. We have so many chances
to succeed.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.080
[operatic singing]

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.740
I submitted a show to "STP" - which stands
for

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.560
Student Theatre Productions - which is a
completely student run organization on campus.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.249
Our purpose is to provide more opportunities
for

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:23.529
students in this community.
Last year's production of Midsummer Night's Dream

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:25.929
we had the dance people involved,

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:32.319
we had the orchestra and voice kids,
design kids - it was great to just all come

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:34.619
together to create this awesome thing.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.980
What I think is instilled here is you learn through the doing.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:44.300
The more doing you do
the more you will learn.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.729
It's so exciting when you find a solution
When you've been in the Design studio and

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.229
you're working so hard and nothing's looking good
and nothing's working, and then all of a sudden

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.529
you shift one thing and it all comes together.

00:01:57.529 --> 00:02:00.920
That moment is so perfect.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.799
Discovering my own voice is something
that would define my experience here -

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:08.759
because that's what all the teachers want
you to do. They don't really want you to say

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.510
what's already been said. They want you to
find basically what you're passionate about,

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.080
and how you can pursue that in your art.
Ultimately, prepare you for the art world

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.400
when
you graduate.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.140
Don't worry so much if you don't know yet.
But, be ready to find your passion.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.500
So long as you're doing what you love,
and you're going to work hard at it,

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.790
and be serious about it, then there's not
anything else quite as satisfying.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.760
You'll have a good time.
And, it's a great city - really pretty.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:46.300
It's just the best. It really is.
It has absolutely blown my mind,

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.570
I am very happy I'm here
