to<00:00:29.939> call<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.210> this<00:00:30.660> tree<00:00:30.929> cannot<00:00:31.289> continue<00:00:31.800> to

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
to call it this tree cannot continue to

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.880 
to call it this tree cannot continue to
grow<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.700> way<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.600> have<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.500> choice

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
grow the way that it is I have a choice

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.330 
grow the way that it is I have a choice
of<00:00:35.190> training<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.000> branches<00:00:36.450> down<00:00:36.750> or<00:00:37.340> pruning

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
of training the branches down or pruning

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.549 
of training the branches down or pruning
them<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.270> thought<00:00:39.420> about<00:00:39.690> both<00:00:39.989> methods

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
them and I thought about both methods

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.650 
them and I thought about both methods
and<00:00:40.770> since<00:00:41.460> I'm<00:00:41.610> gonna<00:00:41.730> have<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.090> many<00:00:42.180> plants

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
and since I'm gonna have so many plants

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.560 
and since I'm gonna have so many plants
going<00:00:42.840> into<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.200> small<00:00:43.950> room<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.820> think<00:00:45.360> what<00:00:45.480> I'm

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
going into a small room I think what I'm

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.180 
going into a small room I think what I'm
gonna<00:00:45.690> do<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.110> I'm<00:00:46.230> going<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.440> prune<00:00:46.649> this<00:00:46.860> down

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
gonna do is I'm going to prune this down

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.380 
gonna do is I'm going to prune this down
and<00:00:47.550> keep<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.660> like<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.079> compact<00:00:50.000> shorter<00:00:51.000> tree

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
and keep it like a compact shorter tree

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.910 
and keep it like a compact shorter tree
I'm<00:00:51.539> not<00:00:51.690> going<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.899> prune<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.230> way<00:00:52.350> down<00:00:52.590> and

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
I'm not going to prune it way down and

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.490 
I'm not going to prune it way down and
have<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.460> bush<00:00:53.789> I'm<00:00:54.360> gonna<00:00:54.570> prune<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:54.960> down<00:00:55.170> and

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
have a bush I'm gonna prune it down and

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.069 
have a bush I'm gonna prune it down and
have<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.160> short<00:00:56.579> compact<00:00:57.000> tree<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.930> other

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
have a short compact tree the other

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.260 
have a short compact tree the other
Coco's<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.129> I'm<00:00:59.250> growing<00:00:59.489> I'm<00:00:59.820> gonna<00:01:00.059> have

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
Coco's that I'm growing I'm gonna have

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.240 
Coco's that I'm growing I'm gonna have
those<00:01:00.510> as<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.899> bush<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.770> still<00:01:02.070> going<00:01:02.190> to

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
those as a bush this is still going to

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.520 
those as a bush this is still going to
be<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.430> tree<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:02.910> have<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.270> figure<00:01:03.480> out<00:01:03.629> how<00:01:04.500> I

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
be a tree so I have to figure out how I

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.550 
be a tree so I have to figure out how I
want<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.010> prune<00:01:05.220> this<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:06.150> up<00:01:06.720> close<00:01:07.049> if<00:01:07.409> you

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
want to prune this and up close if you

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.780 
want to prune this and up close if you
look<00:01:07.740> at<00:01:07.890> this<00:01:07.979> actually<00:01:08.369> why<00:01:08.460> don't<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.640> come

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
look at this actually why don't you come

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.190 
look at this actually why don't you come
on<00:01:08.850> over<00:01:08.909> here<00:01:09.299> up<00:01:09.450> close<00:01:09.479> I'll<00:01:09.840> show<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.080> what

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
on over here up close I'll show you what

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.010 
on over here up close I'll show you what
it<00:01:10.290> looks<00:01:10.470> like<00:01:10.640> normally<00:01:11.640> on<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.180> cocoa<00:01:12.990> tree

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
it looks like normally on a cocoa tree

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.560 
it looks like normally on a cocoa tree
on<00:01:13.799> each<00:01:13.950> branch<00:01:14.400> you're<00:01:14.880> gonna<00:01:15.030> have<00:01:15.240> leaves

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
on each branch you're gonna have leaves

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.390 
on each branch you're gonna have leaves
let<00:01:16.110> me<00:01:16.200> try<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.439> I'm<00:01:16.710> trying<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.100> hold<00:01:17.220> the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
let me try and I'm trying to hold the

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.490 
let me try and I'm trying to hold the
camera<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:17.790> point<00:01:18.240> at<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.450> same<00:01:18.630> time<00:01:18.869> see

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
camera and point at the same time see

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.109 
camera and point at the same time see
just<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.070> regular<00:01:20.340> leaf<00:01:20.520> coming<00:01:20.759> out<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.030> a

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
just a regular leaf coming out of a

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.300 
just a regular leaf coming out of a
branch<00:01:21.390> well<00:01:22.170> since<00:01:22.500> I've<00:01:22.619> been<00:01:22.770> pruning<00:01:23.159> this

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
branch well since I've been pruning this

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.179 
branch well since I've been pruning this
so<00:01:23.580> hard<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.720> keep<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.020> from<00:01:25.140> getting<00:01:25.290> too<00:01:25.439> tall

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
so hard to keep it from getting too tall

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.140 
so hard to keep it from getting too tall
most<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.390> these<00:01:27.869> branches<00:01:28.590> here<00:01:29.040> don't<00:01:29.970> have

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
most of these branches here don't have

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.230 
most of these branches here don't have
just<00:01:30.450> leaves<00:01:30.689> take<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.200> look<00:01:31.409> at<00:01:31.530> this<00:01:31.970> each<00:01:32.970> one

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
just leaves take a look at this each one

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.289 
just leaves take a look at this each one
of<00:01:33.420> these<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:33.960> growing<00:01:34.290> tip<00:01:34.680> holy<00:01:35.400> Moses

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
of these is a growing tip holy Moses

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.990 
of these is a growing tip holy Moses
yep<00:01:36.540> so<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.829> don't<00:01:38.070> have<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.280> problem<00:01:38.850> with

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
yep so I don't have a problem with

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.460 
yep so I don't have a problem with
pruning<00:01:39.360> this<00:01:39.479> back<00:01:39.720> because<00:01:40.049> anywhere<00:01:40.439> I

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
pruning this back because anywhere I

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.170 
pruning this back because anywhere I
prune<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.890> back<00:01:40.920> there's<00:01:41.880> going<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.119> be

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
prune it back there's going to be

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.149 
prune it back there's going to be
growing<00:01:42.479> tips<00:01:42.810> all<00:01:43.020> over<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.380> place<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.920> if<00:01:44.070> I

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
growing tips all over the place and if I

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.460 
growing tips all over the place and if I
put<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.430> back<00:01:44.460> heavily<00:01:45.000> it's<00:01:45.659> got<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.290> much

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
put it back heavily it's got so much

prune<00:02:04.469> will<00:02:04.979> get<00:02:05.250> stronger<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:06.060> thicker<00:02:06.299> same

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
prune will get stronger and thicker same

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.529

okay<00:02:16.750> let's<00:02:17.049> talk<00:02:17.290> more<00:02:17.500> chopping<00:02:18.010> I'm<00:02:18.760> gonna

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:18.969 
okay let's talk more chopping I'm gonna

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:21.899 
okay let's talk more chopping I'm gonna
want<00:02:19.269> to<00:02:19.420> leave<00:02:19.569> these<00:02:19.980> approximately<00:02:20.980> I'd

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
want to leave these approximately I'd

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.030 
want to leave these approximately I'd
say<00:02:22.209> a<00:02:22.239> foot<00:02:22.540> long<00:02:22.780> so<00:02:23.500> I'm<00:02:23.620> going<00:02:23.739> to<00:02:23.769> trim<00:02:23.980> it

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
say a foot long so I'm going to trim it

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.780 
say a foot long so I'm going to trim it
here<00:02:24.430> I<00:02:25.709> don't<00:02:26.709> think<00:02:26.890> you<00:02:27.159> can<00:02:27.310> route<00:02:27.579> these

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
here I don't think you can route these

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.509 
here I don't think you can route these
but<00:02:28.150> I'm<00:02:28.359> really<00:02:28.599> not<00:02:28.870> sure<00:02:29.189> this<00:02:30.189> one's<00:02:30.400> going

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
but I'm really not sure this one's going

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.259 
but I'm really not sure this one's going
to<00:02:30.579> be<00:02:30.670> about<00:02:30.909> a<00:02:30.970> foot<00:02:31.150> oh<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:33.250> since<00:02:33.819> I'm<00:02:34.060> five

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
to be about a foot oh and since I'm five

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:35.940 
to be about a foot oh and since I'm five
foot<00:02:34.540> six<00:02:34.900> five<00:02:35.200> foot<00:02:35.409> seven

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
foot six five foot seven

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.129 
foot six five foot seven
I<00:02:36.099> still<00:02:36.459> got<00:02:36.670> quite<00:02:37.329> a<00:02:37.359> bit<00:02:37.629> that<00:02:37.780> this<00:02:37.930> can

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:38.139 
I still got quite a bit that this can

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:40.920 
I still got quite a bit that this can
grow<00:02:38.379> and<00:02:38.889> I'm<00:02:39.099> gonna<00:02:39.370> allow<00:02:39.909> it<00:02:39.939> to<00:02:40.209> grow<00:02:40.599> out

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
grow and I'm gonna allow it to grow out

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.250 
grow and I'm gonna allow it to grow out
in<00:02:41.829> and<00:02:42.310> around<00:02:43.180> but<00:02:43.510> I'm<00:02:43.629> not<00:02:43.659> gonna<00:02:43.959> let<00:02:44.230> it

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
in and around but I'm not gonna let it

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.470 
in and around but I'm not gonna let it
grow<00:02:44.590> too<00:02:45.189> awful<00:02:45.579> much<00:02:45.819> it's<00:02:46.150> gonna<00:02:46.269> be

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
grow too awful much it's gonna be

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.990 
grow too awful much it's gonna be
creative<00:02:47.019> pruning<00:02:47.470> for<00:02:47.709> sure<00:02:47.980> but<00:02:48.730> I<00:02:48.790> think

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
creative pruning for sure but I think

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.349 
creative pruning for sure but I think
I'm<00:02:49.269> up<00:02:49.420> to<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:49.659> task<00:02:50.819> it's<00:02:51.819> not<00:02:51.970> gonna<00:02:52.150> look

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:52.359 
I'm up to the task it's not gonna look

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:54.110 
I'm up to the task it's not gonna look
very<00:02:52.419> good<00:02:52.720> right<00:02:52.959> away<00:02:53.439> but<00:02:53.680> then<00:02:53.829> again

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
very good right away but then again

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.949 
very good right away but then again

that I make here myself I took good care
of<00:04:54.660> him<00:04:54.840> gave<00:04:54.990> plenty<00:04:55.200> of<00:04:55.380> light<00:04:55.530> gave<00:04:56.070> the

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
of him gave plenty of light gave the

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.680 
of him gave plenty of light gave the
right<00:04:56.370> amount<00:04:56.610> of<00:04:56.670> water<00:04:56.820> and<00:04:57.150> eventually<00:04:57.600> we

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
right amount of water and eventually we

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.330 
right amount of water and eventually we
got<00:04:57.780> little<00:04:58.200> tiny<00:04:58.410> shoots<00:04:58.740> coming<00:04:59.010> out<00:04:59.190> of

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
got little tiny shoots coming out of

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.030 
got little tiny shoots coming out of
them<00:04:59.460> and<00:04:59.640> they<00:05:00.000> did<00:05:00.150> fine<00:05:00.419> I<00:05:00.720> decided<00:05:01.560> that<00:05:01.770> on

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
them and they did fine I decided that on

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.920 
them and they did fine I decided that on
one<00:05:02.250> of<00:05:02.280> them<00:05:02.520> I'm<00:05:02.669> gonna<00:05:02.760> let<00:05:03.000> it<00:05:03.030> go<00:05:03.150> wild<00:05:03.750> and

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
one of them I'm gonna let it go wild and

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.960 
one of them I'm gonna let it go wild and
so<00:05:04.110> I<00:05:04.140> left<00:05:04.680> it<00:05:04.770> at<00:05:04.890> full<00:05:05.070> height<00:05:05.310> about<00:05:05.669> maybe

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
so I left it at full height about maybe

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.909 
so I left it at full height about maybe
three<00:05:06.300> and<00:05:06.390> a<00:05:06.419> half<00:05:06.540> feet<00:05:06.690> tall<00:05:06.750> this<00:05:07.620> one<00:05:07.890> I

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
three and a half feet tall this one I

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.550 
three and a half feet tall this one I
decided<00:05:08.370> I<00:05:08.700> wanted<00:05:08.880> it<00:05:09.150> to<00:05:09.360> be<00:05:09.480> a<00:05:09.510> short<00:05:10.050> Bush<00:05:10.320> I

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
decided I wanted it to be a short Bush I

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.220 
decided I wanted it to be a short Bush I
like<00:05:10.919> variety<00:05:11.100> and<00:05:11.790> so<00:05:12.600> what<00:05:12.720> I<00:05:12.870> did<00:05:12.930> was<00:05:13.140> I

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
like variety and so what I did was I

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.760 
like variety and so what I did was I
prune<00:05:13.440> it<00:05:13.590> back<00:05:13.620> and<00:05:14.010> I<00:05:14.430> forced<00:05:14.850> some<00:05:15.390> of<00:05:15.510> the

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
prune it back and I forced some of the

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.500
