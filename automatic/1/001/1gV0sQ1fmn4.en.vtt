00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.260
 university actors since they sport 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:22.950
 but territory 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:25.270
 [Music] 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.640
 lime-new crowd of great days for 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.439
 the Nordic combined world cup at 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.660
 this opportunity French athletes have 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.520
 received a nice gift back from edge 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.080
 offer in Germany the brand new 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.970
 waxing truck of France teams 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.100
 Nordic ski was for the first time 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.480
 times in France on a competition 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.800
 each team now a big 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.530
 team for all a truck since 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.150
 a few years already and we actually 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.890
 this bet actually to have a model 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.470
 a bit special a little special it's 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.970
 not 39 tons it's also a real 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.440
 advantage for runners there is a 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.960
 psychological aspect is obvious 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.200
 to have come out with 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.660
 feel how to say with a beautiful truck 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.340
 that comes to help the logistics an effect 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.040
 psychological that can be read in 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.540
 eyes ten athletes it's still 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.479
 it's still the class on occasion 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.680
 of sharing here in new lime we are the 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:13.990
 first team in the Nordic combined 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.670
 to have a truck like that so that's 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.090
 great for sure we have the chance 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.460
 to have this waxing truck with the 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.710
 structure of the interior to make 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.709
 work right now on the ground and 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.030
 I hope it will pay 

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:30.130
 at the level of the thigh but they make the 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.679
 good job and I think my neck with 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.280
 that in addition it gives even more the 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:35.890
 motivation 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.410
 yes it's true that for us it's the 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.490
 weight class if you really like 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.740
 Super beautiful 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.829
 inside they are the technicians 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.350
 the factors really have a month of 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:49.090
 gear to married men for strong they 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.850
 are they going to have working conditions 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.869
 who are really great yes that allows 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.670
 especially compared to biathlon and ski 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.799
 of background to follow the wagon because he 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.780
 there are already 6 2 7 6 7 trucks on the cut 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.490
 the world so we want to say to 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.649
 wagon and Nordic combined suites 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.119
 it's downright mean of Vence January 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:05.710
 because it's the first truck 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.019
 Official coming out on the circuit 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.330
 a trailer 16 meters long by 4 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:12.670
 may 30 wide thanks to a very 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.769
 ingenious drawer the waxing gun 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.239
 is equipped with six positions and includes 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.170
 also the happy structure a machine 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.390
 numerically controlled 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.610
 formerly stationed at premanon there we are in 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.650
 paraffin train and a six that the 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.620
 structure is this morning in the truck 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.060
 so already it's a big advantage to have 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.890
 the happy structure here that we're going 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.450
 ability to work on all sites 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.430
 of world cup so that's it really 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.350
 the big plus then the second 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.900
 advantage is a little what we see there 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.120
 there so the irons are directly 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.000
 plugged into aspirations so for the 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.390
 health of technicians it's a big 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.730
 more 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.070
 which also has all the comfort we have 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.840
 place to work there six positions of 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.630
 work so we can work 1,6 at the same 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.150
 good time we combine electro so 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.510
 but it's really super great tool 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.310
 job 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.780
 design a waxing truck it was 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.550
 an extraordinary project for the 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.810
 bodywork delberghe install the rock 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.300
 on foron in Haute Savoie 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.430
 this original project she led in 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.810
 close liaison with the teams from 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.150
 National Nordic Ski Center 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.980
 premanon the most difficult at the level of 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.459
 the design is the semi 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.920
 trailer who is behind who is on 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.239
 a base of semi trailers 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.150
 as if they were refrigerated with 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.890
 insulated panels and extensions of 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.920
 each hydraulic side that allow 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:32.010
 to enlarge the width of the vehicle for 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.390
 I would say brought the specificity of a 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.130
 wider workshop truck 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.900
 as you see it inside big 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.700
 designers in there is still 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.829
 Gregory deschamps so that's the boss 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.360
 of the glide of the biathlon him during 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:44.040
 two years because they were also on 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.170
 a circuit where there was already a lot of 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.130
 German seedlings Norwegian and so of 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.530
 Following could visit them 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.250
 it's a small idea then revisit the 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.829
 French fashionable concept is actually 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.900
 history for example drawers of 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:00.000
 extensions of which a convenience to 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.260
 the interior which is really top what the 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.209
 QuÃ©ment waxing and colors 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.769
 general council of the jura who contributed 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.340
 to its financing with the company 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:10.049
 hydro stadium a subsidiary of the edf group 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.670
 departmental communities reinforces 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:14.130
 so his presence in the Nordic 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.260
 french them for me the jura was the 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.510
 land I would say Nordic skiing and 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.070
 cross-country skiing and we wish 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.850
 communicate to make people want 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.740
 large number 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.120
 come in our department and he we 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.250
 seemed in the relationship that we have 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.230
 with the France team with the 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.240
 French ski federation and although 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.280
 this partnership around this truck 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.320
 was good complement what we have 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.180
 already it is an equipment that will show 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.100
 that the jura which is a small department 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:43.259
 can play in the big leagues 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.259
 [Music] 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:52.340
 [Music] 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:05:03.770
