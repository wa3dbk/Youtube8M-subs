00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.349
 this is the app cruz kate das 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:18.150
 is a fingerboard skate game 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:20.310
 and yes, most people have problems 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.590
 so in this indoor skatepark 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.320
 unlock because you can namely in the 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.279
 buy German app store or somehow 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.949
 Unlock different 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.330
 Some may be doing an apk 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.099
 download and have directly the 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.890
 skatepark takes everything as possible 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.540
 say but had other again 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.920
 it does not work and I show 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.090
 Now how he gets this to work 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.610
 or 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.660
 would one of the numbers pk I have to 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.910
 download area in the 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.620
 description of our country so I open 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.719
 now once explorer so that you too in the 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:01.070
 video so the video in the game can see 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.070
 and open russ kate 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:12.560
 You can see I'm already in the middle of now 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:14.360
 indoor skatepark yes ok we catch carries 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.660
 yes we have to do the tutorials now 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.020
 go and here we have one stop 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.020
 problem 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.340
 I know very well in the map in it 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.150
 that means we go now once 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:42.190
 turn on the menu once 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:44.210
 Take a look at the options 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.740
 Here you can easily screen 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.200
 already put visitors high 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:52.009
 and now we have to set ourselves once 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:56.720
 session marca go and go here now 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:58.130
 on Beck so what did that bring us 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.560
 can now reset a 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.140
 We're back to the same point 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.330
 hope you can do it later, too 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:20.420
 just hold down here but now 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:22.610
 is that so now we come to the problem 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.769
 and we do not know what to do 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.790
 Finally, here is a map would be yes 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.080
 by now on state i would just 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.060
 fall down and not at all on the floor 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.190
 come and therefore sit down once 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.390
 back and am now, so to speak, on the 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:43.450
 place where we started I do 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.450
 now here are the top five shots 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:52.790
 and then I can do that too 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.790
 start driving, so to speak 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.970
 so 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:14.520
 it also has adverse namely course 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.890
 we can not now from the beginning the 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.380
 do mission because the holders of 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.960
 other parks with me I'm still three times 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.530
 work the new innovations 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:31.530
 somehow reinsert though 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:32.880
 It does not look good because then I do 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.260
 I thank you for watching 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.520
 I wish you much fun in the interpark yes 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.930
 and I will do some more videos 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:44.280
 upload at the latest two days you have 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.210
 again a new video and that goes 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:50.010
 therefore install this 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.360
 when installing an error too 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.130
 get by not enough 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.130
 memory space would have been enough though 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.000
 had 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.360
 however, that needed from a root 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.780
 right so eisler was a lot of fun and 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.780
 pure skin
