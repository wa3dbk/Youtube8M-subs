brining<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.670> turkey<00:00:08.700> involves<00:00:09.450> soaking<00:00:09.809> in

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
brining the turkey involves soaking in

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.629 
brining the turkey involves soaking in
an<00:00:09.990> assault<00:00:10.290> solution<00:00:10.800> until<00:00:11.130> it<00:00:11.219> absorbs

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
an assault solution until it absorbs

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.580 
an assault solution until it absorbs
some<00:00:11.849> of<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:12.000> moisture<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:12.630> salts<00:00:13.139> so<00:00:13.440> that

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
some of the moisture and salts so that

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.169 
some of the moisture and salts so that
after<00:00:13.830> you've<00:00:13.950> roasted<00:00:14.429> it<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.759> turkey<00:00:15.059> is

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
after you've roasted it the turkey is

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.930 
after you've roasted it the turkey is
moister<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:15.809> more<00:00:16.410> flavorful<00:00:16.830> it's<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:17.730> pretty

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
moister and more flavorful it's a pretty

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:18.830 
moister and more flavorful it's a pretty
simple<00:00:18.180> process

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
simple process

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.109 
simple process
the<00:00:19.080> only<00:00:19.230> real<00:00:19.529> trick<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:20.640> finding<00:00:21.029> a

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
the only real trick to it is finding a

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.670 
the only real trick to it is finding a
container<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.600> put<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.900> turkey<00:00:22.170> in<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.439> brine

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
container to put the turkey in the brine

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.250 
container to put the turkey in the brine
in<00:00:23.070> there's<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.119> few<00:00:24.330> options<00:00:24.720> for<00:00:24.960> that<00:00:25.050> and

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
in there's a few options for that and

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.660 
in there's a few options for that and
we'll<00:00:25.350> get<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.560> those<00:00:25.710> in<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.920> few<00:00:26.130> minutes<00:00:26.430> but

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
we'll get to those in a few minutes but

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.640 
we'll get to those in a few minutes but
first<00:00:26.730> let's<00:00:27.090> make<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.300> brine<00:00:27.599> you<00:00:28.380> make<00:00:28.529> the

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
first let's make the brine you make the

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.519 
first let's make the brine you make the
brine<00:00:28.890> first<00:00:29.760> start<00:00:30.090> with<00:00:30.330> two<00:00:31.019> quarts<00:00:31.439> of

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
brine first start with two quarts of

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.130 
brine first start with two quarts of
water<00:00:31.969> you<00:00:32.969> need<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.239> use<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.390> vessel<00:00:33.960> that's

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
water you need to use a vessel that's

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.170 
water you need to use a vessel that's
quite<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.559> bit<00:00:34.710> bigger<00:00:34.890> than<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.250> amount<00:00:36.030> of

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
quite a bit bigger than the amount of

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.360 
quite a bit bigger than the amount of
salt<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.200> water<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.770> you're<00:00:37.890> starting<00:00:38.190> with

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
salt and water that you're starting with

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.560 
salt and water that you're starting with
because<00:00:38.790> we're<00:00:38.910> going<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.090> be<00:00:39.180> adding<00:00:39.450> more

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
because we're going to be adding more

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.299 
because we're going to be adding more
water<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.110> afterwards<00:00:40.800> what<00:00:40.920> we're<00:00:41.070> doing

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
water to it afterwards what we're doing

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.979 
water to it afterwards what we're doing
here<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.579> really<00:00:41.610> just<00:00:41.850> making<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.390> brine<00:00:42.629> base

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
here is really just making a brine base

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.680 
here is really just making a brine base
so<00:00:43.739> two<00:00:43.829> quarts<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.309> water<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.879> one<00:00:45.329> cup<00:00:45.360> of

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
so two quarts of water and one cup of

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.490 
so two quarts of water and one cup of
salts<00:00:46.050> this<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:46.890> kosher<00:00:47.100> salt<00:00:48.020> if<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.289> were<00:00:49.410> to

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
salts this is kosher salt if you were to

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.990 
salts this is kosher salt if you were to
use<00:00:49.620> regular<00:00:50.100> salt<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.610> would<00:00:50.730> need<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:50.969> use

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
use regular salt you would need to use

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.959 
use regular salt you would need to use
less<00:00:51.180> maybe<00:00:52.079> about<00:00:52.410> 3/4<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.489> cup<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.670> salt

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
less maybe about 3/4 of a cup of salt

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.240 
less maybe about 3/4 of a cup of salt
because<00:00:54.870> kosher<00:00:55.320> salt<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.739> fluffier<00:00:56.160> and

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
because kosher salt is fluffier and

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.099 
because kosher salt is fluffier and
there's<00:00:56.699> less<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.449> in<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.570> cup<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.050> then

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
there's less of it in a cup and then

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.639 
there's less of it in a cup and then
this<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> quarter<00:00:59.579> cup<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.820> sugar<00:01:00.140> so<00:01:01.140> the

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
this is a quarter cup of sugar so the

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.229 
this is a quarter cup of sugar so the
next<00:01:01.829> step<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.370> just<00:01:02.489> dissolve<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.030> salt

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
next step is to just dissolve the salt

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.240 
next step is to just dissolve the salt
and<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.480> sugar<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.019> water<00:01:04.049> if<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.010> wanted

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
and the sugar in the water if you wanted

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.620 
and the sugar in the water if you wanted
to<00:01:05.309> add<00:01:05.430> more<00:01:05.640> flavor<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.030> your<00:01:06.119> Brian<00:01:06.420> you

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
to add more flavor to your Brian you

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.270 
to add more flavor to your Brian you
could<00:01:06.780> add<00:01:06.869> some<00:01:07.110> herbs<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.439> spices<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:07.979> that

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
could add some herbs and spices and that

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.980 
could add some herbs and spices and that
would<00:01:08.369> be<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.520> good<00:01:08.670> time<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:08.909> do<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.330> I'm<00:01:09.869> gonna

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
would be a good time to do it I'm gonna

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.719 
would be a good time to do it I'm gonna
put<00:01:10.080> this<00:01:10.290> on<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.530> stove<00:01:10.619> over<00:01:11.250> medium-high

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
put this on the stove over medium-high

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.780 
put this on the stove over medium-high
heat<00:01:12.170> and<00:01:13.170> just<00:01:13.409> warm<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.920> stirring<00:01:14.310> every<00:01:14.670> now

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
heat and just warm it stirring every now

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.310 
heat and just warm it stirring every now
and<00:01:14.970> again<00:01:15.000> until<00:01:15.720> it's<00:01:15.840> with<00:01:15.960> salt<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.290> sugar

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
and again until it's with salt and sugar

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.640 
and again until it's with salt and sugar
is<00:01:16.680> disolved<00:01:18.020> I'm<00:01:19.020> going<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.229> take<00:01:19.350> your<00:01:19.500> brine

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
is disolved I'm going to take your brine

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.620 
is disolved I'm going to take your brine
off<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.979> stove<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.700> let<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.210> cool<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.479> room

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
off the stove and let it cool to room

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.570 
off the stove and let it cool to room
temperature

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
temperature

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.649 
temperature
once<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.729> brine<00:01:23.939> is<00:01:23.970> cool<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.540> room

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
once the brine is cool to room

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:25.910 
once the brine is cool to room
temperature<00:01:24.689> you're<00:01:25.350> going<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.500> add<00:01:25.650> another

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
temperature you're going to add another

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.310 
temperature you're going to add another
two<00:01:26.159> quarts<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.610> liquid<00:01:27.060> this<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.600> water<00:01:27.869> but

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
two quarts of liquid this is water but

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.870 
two quarts of liquid this is water but
you<00:01:28.500> could<00:01:28.650> also<00:01:28.770> add<00:01:29.130> another<00:01:29.400> kind<00:01:29.790> of

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
you could also add another kind of

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.399 
you could also add another kind of
liquid<00:01:30.210> that's<00:01:30.420> more<00:01:30.630> flavorful<00:01:31.229> that's

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
liquid that's more flavorful that's

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.020 
liquid that's more flavorful that's
another<00:01:31.650> way<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:31.860> get<00:01:32.100> water<00:01:32.340> over<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.820> your

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
another way to get water over to your

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.710 
another way to get water over to your
brine<00:01:33.270> like<00:01:33.900> apple<00:01:34.229> cider<00:01:34.409> or<00:01:34.619> even<00:01:34.920> coffee

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
brine like apple cider or even coffee

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.969 
brine like apple cider or even coffee
now<00:01:36.720> I'm<00:01:36.780> gonna<00:01:36.930> put<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.439> fridge<00:01:37.710> and

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
now I'm gonna put this in the fridge and

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.550 
now I'm gonna put this in the fridge and
