00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:07.529
 Welcome to the job pay tv i 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.940
 am johannes keller and answer today 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.639
 I ask the question why why why 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.480
 what with the ground leg press on to 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.920
 has to do that is super German and 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.090
 Although I have quite a lot and quite a lot 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.070
 ask already get to both 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.510
 press and why why and 45 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.830
 degree at the press and what can you mine 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.869
 note tape press and here below us 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.340
 and i'm supposed to make a video about the weinpresse 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.240
 do 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:33.690
 this is now my video too 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:36.630
 press but we have no press that 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.000
 means with the leg press you can super 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.219
 move a lot of weight 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.379
 but it is like everyone else 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.879
 you do not need a machine either 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.920
 body control you do not need any 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.140
 Body coordination nothing at all 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.770
 you can just put in there and that 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.360
 Move weight because that's the machine 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.920
 because of the guided movement everything 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.410
 for you up to the power to 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.440
 produce and produce power 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.210
 relatively just the whole thing 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.070
 functional framework also on the point 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.540
 to bring and get in free space 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.460
 then move is a completely different one 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.740
 history 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:15.920
 lately we had a guy from the saints 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:19.650
 jim get 170 180 kilo karenz man 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.200
 and he came in and wanted jim and 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.210
 you came in 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.220
 you have no equipment with manja 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.189
 baumann is all there to decent 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.890
 can not train at all 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.439
 leg press because and make my teeth 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.680
 series with 250 kilo he press and 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.659
 I've said get him the barbell 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.460
 on the back and have said 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.270
 a squat and the saarland follows 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.549
 He had the weight on his back 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.229
 only ten centimeters done and then 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.970
 are already the knee after he got there 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.560
 is collapsed in the back and the hack 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.360
 are yet come to he has not yet 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.329
 more able to sit down and 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.369
 provided him with something useful here ten series 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.719
 with 240 juliana anna wine press if you 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.490
 Do not sit down sometimes without injury 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.009
 You can already do that 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.350
 extreme example what shows that one 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.330
 when outdoors in the open nature if 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.819
 you can sit down again with and 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.020
 as in the barbell with 20 kilos 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.050
 apparently does not permit if 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.990
 240 km / h main press does but how much 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.460
 this leg press far away from reality 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.780
 of course I could not 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.710
 judge how he made the leg press 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:29.190
 which also includes a sum but was model 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:31.680
 yes fact is with the leg press I think 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.510
 whatever else is what 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.000
 for bodybuilders to match those 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.830
 Leg muscles again to burn out 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.530
 bring or in particular foot 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.090
 positions certain muscles more 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.320
 to claim and continue 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.290
 work out 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:49.310
 but honest guys if you do not 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.570
 plans to go to the stage 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.490
 then let the two press away 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.190
 and the split training plan away and 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.930
 various masch rabbit away let yourself 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.510
 decently instruct and then do the 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.400
 Body weight training and what he is 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.090
 somehow gymnastics and a bit with 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.380
 free dumbbells have a squat just 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.230
 much as much larger 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.940
 Advantages on the one hand you can in asia 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.590
 just use the toilets and 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.600
 shit because it's easy there 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.100
 time to sit down there you put it 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.300
 our footsteps are pure and then 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.850
 Here you can do it alone 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.350
 it still pure or you can him 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.940
 play with your children accordingly 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.920
 Just take you in the main thus 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.810
 a child play does or you are 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.820
 somehow in Asia or works socially 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.450
 even in this position or just 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.260
 quite banal you just sit in 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.160
 many of them can not even more so 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:40.260
 sit down without completely collapsing 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.180
 so far what has it with the 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.990
 Legs care nothing if you 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.780
 did not want to go to the stage and 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.520
 bodybuilder since fuck on the press 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.720
 and did squats if that 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.340
 Squats do not get decent 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.250
 found with out progressed beginning with 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.650
 porsche so it can only part movement 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.170
 the squat or anything and 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.340
 works on the squat works on 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.500
 child labor in their agility 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.570
 or find out what's on first 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.000
 your squat just shit book 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:08.760
 by a trainer and take that first 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.709
 apart before somehow to the 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.020
 leg press goes and press at 240 kilos 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.810
 can or can push or scoff 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.040
 but can not sit down 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.770
 without complete 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:25.300
 to have the collapse in the body yes that 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:29.110
