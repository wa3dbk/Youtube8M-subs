00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.800
 hello music lovers and welcome to this 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.710
 video test today we crown the twin 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.270
 costa lab compressor your in 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.550
 costa compressor goes well a pedal 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.830
 double is a double compressor that there 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.960
 allows you to switch between two of the 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.400
 mode with compressor between sounds 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.620
 compressor that made history 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.590
 of the modern guitar here we have the 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.600
 ros mode and the doe mode a 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.000
 small hint that we will hear it 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.310
 cross mode is a sound of 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.850
 and a softer compression 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.800
 slower release and doe mode 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.050
 instead it allows us to have an attack 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.900
 more ready and a shorter release 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.090
 let's hear a little start then with the 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.210
 ros how we feel before our 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.210
 team 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:03.479
 the attack is really very very round 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.880
 soft and this slow release leaves the 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:15.150
 notes a bit like they were a bit 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:18.030
 fatigued we try now from 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.459
 amplify a bit its stand him 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:36.840
 we raise up to two thirds and see that 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:37.650
 kind of sound gives us do it 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.450
 resent clean 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.450
 just to feel the difference 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:52.680
 obviously the notes take a lot more 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.110
 body are more supported by ours 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.359
 hospital with the deer instead with the 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.760
 mode doe we can experience ad 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:02.790
 example of the most ready sound more 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.840
 funky for example let's see clean first 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.840
 and then with the compressor 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.840
 let's try the same sound with the same 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.990
 time with a little more support for two 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.990
 third 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.210
 the to in complex behaves a lot 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:11.700
 also good on the sounds more related to 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.090
 pop world where the arpeggiated parts 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.160
 clean 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.560
 we need to have especially in 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.269
 study of the sounds that are within 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.250
 a specific dynamic range of its own 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.670
 to not go to disturb the item or 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.920
 other arrangement tools first 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.900
 we try it without a compressor and then col 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.590
 compressor both red and in mode 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.590
 by the nar 

00:04:58.059 --> 00:05:02.499
 now with the doe mode 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.170
 finally beyond all the working methods 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:29.500
 of this compressor on the clean 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:32.200
 it is very effective even when 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.640
 goes to taste the preamplifier of one 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.220
 valve head 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:38.080
 this is the sound we say I don't have 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:45.070
 worked by the compressor a compressor 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:48.840
 turned off his m1 and let's go to 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.840
 add compressor with red now 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.830
 no 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.220
 well the music lovers here we are at the end of 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.170
 this video test your in compressor 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.240
 of costa lab is definitely a tool 

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:21.070
 which can also be used for purposes 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.990
 creative as well as doing his job well 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:25.420
 of compressor especially for that 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.040
 which concerns the clean business 

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:30.870
 where we need an adjustment 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:32.980
 it is a leveling of all dynamics 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:35.050
 especially for studio work for 

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.710
 the activity of a shift worker has us a lot 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.230
 hit it 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:41.470
 how it affects how it goes to 

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:44.290
 emphasize the sound of a headboard 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:45.190
 tube already packed in a state of 

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:47.620
 drive 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:51.220
 this because it keeps high and increases 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:53.350
 still its stand of the sound we are 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.510
 using that moment improves his 

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:57.820
 disability under the fingers and allows us to 

00:06:55.510 --> 00:07:00.640
 get out a little better inside the mix 

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:02.770
 without pindarici flights that can be 

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.660
 however, give volume, etc., etc. 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:07.390
 between the two modes I personally echo a 

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:10.360
 little personal opinion I prefer 

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:11.860
 the red one because it is more suitable just for 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.990
 this sound we played at 

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:17.410
 end this sound that comes out of the mix 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:19.590
 this one just so big and packed 

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:23.500
 I find the daina comp version very much 

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:25.480
 very precise very composed and goes 

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:27.160
 very well for example those clean parts 

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:29.890
 in style, I do for parts too 

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.660
 arpeggiated in pop style well see you 

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:34.320
 the next review is with 

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.320
 the mesic off video
