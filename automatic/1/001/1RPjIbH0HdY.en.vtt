00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
so you can do most lightweight yarns

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.780 
so you can do most lightweight yarns
some<00:01:14.340> bulky<00:01:14.790> ones<00:01:15.000> but<00:01:15.299> not<00:01:15.479> too<00:01:15.810> thick<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.790> to

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
some bulky ones but not too thick so to

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.789 
some bulky ones but not too thick so to
begin<00:01:18.150> your<00:01:18.330> icord<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:19.049> want<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.320> take<00:01:19.560> your

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
begin your icord you want to take your

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.230 
begin your icord you want to take your
yarn<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.460> you're<00:01:20.610> going<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.790> feed<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.210> through

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
yarn and you're going to feed it through

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:37.930 
yarn and you're going to feed it through
this<00:01:21.720> hole<00:01:22.049> right<00:01:22.080> here

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.000 

then<00:01:38.540> you'll<00:01:38.690> have<00:01:38.870> this<00:01:39.170> groove<00:01:39.560> right<00:01:39.890> at

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
then you'll have this groove right at

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.670 
then you'll have this groove right at
the<00:01:40.130> top<00:01:40.370> and<00:01:40.760> you're<00:01:41.150> going<00:01:41.420> to<00:01:41.480> lay<00:01:41.840> over

you<00:04:39.540> get<00:04:39.750> the<00:04:39.930> link<00:04:40.140> that<00:04:40.260> you<00:04:40.470> want<00:04:43.669> here's<00:04:44.669> a

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
you get the link that you want here's a

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.200 
you get the link that you want here's a
closer<00:04:45.090> view<00:04:45.510> and<00:04:45.750> you<00:04:45.810> can<00:04:45.840> see<00:04:46.230> how<00:04:46.470> the<00:04:46.530> pegs

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
closer view and you can see how the pegs

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.830 
closer view and you can see how the pegs
open<00:04:48.210> and<00:04:48.360> close<00:04:49.790> grabbing<00:04:50.790> the<00:04:51.210> yarn<00:04:51.240> and

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
open and close grabbing the yarn and

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:58.230 
open and close grabbing the yarn and
creating<00:04:52.290> your<00:04:52.440> eye<00:04:52.500> chord

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.779 

this<00:04:58.840> is<00:04:59.050> a<00:04:59.080> lot<00:04:59.410> faster<00:05:00.069> than<00:05:00.099> your<00:05:00.550> normal

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789 
this is a lot faster than your normal

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:03.210 
this is a lot faster than your normal
way<00:05:01.150> of<00:05:01.180> making<00:05:01.690> i-cords<00:05:02.259> with<00:05:02.440> either<00:05:02.889> the

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
way of making i-cords with either the

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.379 
way of making i-cords with either the
double<00:05:03.550> pointed<00:05:03.819> needles<00:05:04.210> are<00:05:04.479> some<00:05:04.840> of<00:05:04.960> those

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
double pointed needles are some of those

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:09.930 
double pointed needles are some of those
those<00:05:07.389> knitting<00:05:07.780> bee<00:05:08.169> kits<00:05:08.590> with<00:05:08.860> the<00:05:09.130> crochet

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
those knitting bee kits with the crochet

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.570 
those knitting bee kits with the crochet
hook<00:05:10.150> and<00:05:10.180> stuff<00:05:10.740> so<00:05:11.740> this<00:05:11.889> you<00:05:12.099> can<00:05:12.250> get<00:05:12.400> your

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
hook and stuff so this you can get your

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.219 
hook and stuff so this you can get your
eye<00:05:12.610> cord<00:05:13.030> done<00:05:13.210> in<00:05:13.419> no<00:05:13.630> time

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:14.229 
eye cord done in no time

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:16.980 
eye cord done in no time
and<00:05:14.699> you<00:05:15.699> can<00:05:15.880> just<00:05:16.060> zip<00:05:16.300> through<00:05:16.330> it<00:05:16.720> and<00:05:16.900> it

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
and you can just zip through it and it

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:29.800 
and you can just zip through it and it
is<00:05:17.080> super<00:05:17.470> fun

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.400 

so<00:05:30.350> then<00:05:30.500> once<00:05:30.710> your<00:05:31.630> once<00:05:32.630> your<00:05:32.780> i-cord<00:05:33.230> gets

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
so then once your once your i-cord gets

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.080 
so then once your once your i-cord gets
long<00:05:33.650> enough<00:05:33.920> that<00:05:34.160> it'll<00:05:34.310> start<00:05:34.639> coming<00:05:34.970> out

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
long enough that it'll start coming out

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:40.060 
long enough that it'll start coming out
at<00:05:35.210> the<00:05:35.270> bottom<00:05:35.450> of<00:05:35.690> your<00:05:35.750> device<00:05:36.200> and<00:05:39.070> I'm

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
at the bottom of your device and I'm

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.040 
at the bottom of your device and I'm
going<00:05:40.190> to<00:05:40.250> show<00:05:40.400> you<00:05:40.430> how<00:05:40.790> to<00:05:40.850> finish<00:05:41.480> off<00:05:41.780> your

going to show you how to finish off your

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.650 
going to show you how to finish off your
I<00:05:42.080> chord<00:05:42.669> so<00:05:43.669> once<00:05:43.820> you<00:05:43.940> get<00:05:44.030> the<00:05:44.240> links<00:05:44.600> that

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
I chord so once you get the links that

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.370 
I chord so once you get the links that
you<00:05:44.780> want<00:05:45.260> you're<00:05:46.160> just<00:05:46.370> going<00:05:46.760> to<00:05:47.200> cut<00:05:48.200> your

you want you're just going to cut your
yarn<00:05:48.440> and<00:05:52.900> up<00:05:53.900> here<00:05:54.350> you're<00:05:54.919> going<00:05:55.160> to<00:05:55.690> pick<00:05:56.690> up

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
yarn and up here you're going to pick up

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.080 
yarn and up here you're going to pick up
your<00:05:57.020> yarn<00:05:57.260> so<00:05:57.590> that<00:05:57.620> the<00:05:58.010> hooks<00:05:58.250> do<00:05:58.580> not<00:05:58.790> grab

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090 
your yarn so that the hooks do not grab

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.690 
your yarn so that the hooks do not grab
it<00:05:59.300> and<00:05:59.620> you<00:06:00.620> just<00:06:00.740> want<00:06:00.919> to<00:06:00.980> rotate<00:06:01.190> until

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
and then you're just going to pull it

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.440 
and then you're just going to pull it
down<00:06:06.110> the<00:06:06.530> center<00:06:07.030> so<00:06:08.030> now<00:06:08.120> you<00:06:08.180> just<00:06:08.300> want<00:06:08.419> to

tapestry needle and the last loop that

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.710 
tapestry needle and the last loop that
your<00:06:15.169> yarn<00:06:15.410> is<00:06:15.590> sticking<00:06:16.040> out<00:06:16.190> of<00:06:16.510> you<00:06:17.510> want<00:06:17.690> to

you

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:38.680 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:45.270 

then<00:06:39.580> go<00:06:39.729> through<00:06:39.759> your<00:06:40.120> final<00:06:40.449> loop<00:06:43.110> and<00:06:44.280> pull

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:51.970 
cord and that is how easy it is to make

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:54.080 
cord and that is how easy it is to make
an<00:06:52.120> eye<00:06:52.270> cord<00:06:52.600> with<00:06:52.810> this<00:06:53.050> knitting<00:06:53.380> machine

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:54.090 
an eye cord with this knitting machine

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:57.210 
an eye cord with this knitting machine
so<00:06:55.090> this<00:06:55.240> is<00:06:55.479> just<00:06:55.750> your<00:06:55.930> standard<00:06:56.289> four<00:06:56.919> ply
