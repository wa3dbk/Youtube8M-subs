00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.790 
the kind of string effect and I love how
this<00:02:58.330> turns<00:02:58.600> out<00:02:58.750> every<00:02:59.350> time<00:02:59.560> that<00:02:59.680> I<00:02:59.740> try<00:02:59.830> it

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.820 

this<00:03:05.800> is<00:03:06.100> how<00:03:06.340> it<00:03:06.489> turned<00:03:06.730> out

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
this is how it turned out

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.940 
this is how it turned out
remember<00:03:08.830> les<00:03:09.670> makes<00:03:10.540> it<00:03:10.750> even<00:03:10.930> look<00:03:11.350> better

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
remember les makes it even look better

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.640 
remember les makes it even look better
so<00:03:12.610> the<00:03:12.730> less<00:03:12.940> if<00:03:13.150> you<00:03:13.239> put<00:03:13.480> on<00:03:13.660> the<00:03:14.170> better<00:03:14.440> it

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
so the less if you put on the better it

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.479 
so the less if you put on the better it
looks<00:03:15.660> now<00:03:16.660> it's<00:03:17.110> time<00:03:17.380> to<00:03:17.500> paint<00:03:17.709> all<00:03:17.920> of<00:03:18.370> the

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
looks now it's time to paint all of the

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:31.230 
looks now it's time to paint all of the
nails<00:03:18.700> with<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.239> feather

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.380 

now<00:03:32.240> it's<00:03:32.510> time<00:03:32.750> for<00:03:33.080> the<00:03:33.410> ring<00:03:33.590> finger<00:03:34.040> I

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
now it's time for the ring finger I

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.210 
now it's time for the ring finger I
would<00:03:35.390> love<00:03:35.630> to<00:03:35.780> color<00:03:36.020> it<00:03:36.260> blue<00:03:36.530> instead<00:03:37.070> of

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
would love to color it blue instead of

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:50.400 
would love to color it blue instead of
pink<00:03:37.880> for<00:03:38.270> it<00:03:39.080> to<00:03:39.230> look<00:03:39.410> even<00:03:39.860> more<00:03:40.010> edgier

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.870 

now<00:03:51.410> that<00:03:51.650> we're<00:03:51.800> done<00:03:52.010> with<00:03:52.220> all<00:03:52.400> the<00:03:52.490> colors

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
now that we're done with all the colors

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.830 
now that we're done with all the colors
it's<00:03:53.150> time<00:03:53.450> for<00:03:53.720> the<00:03:53.810> white<00:03:54.020> as<00:03:55.420> you<00:03:56.420> can<00:03:56.600> see

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
it's time for the white as you can see

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.800 
it's time for the white as you can see
this<00:03:57.080> nail<00:03:57.320> polish<00:03:57.560> is<00:03:58.130> old<00:03:58.580> so<00:03:59.330> it's<00:03:59.480> kind<00:03:59.720> of

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
this nail polish is old so it's kind of

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.710 
this nail polish is old so it's kind of
drying<00:04:00.080> up<00:04:00.430> so<00:04:01.430> I'll<00:04:01.670> be<00:04:01.850> using<00:04:02.240> this<00:04:02.450> to<00:04:02.690> make

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
drying up so I'll be using this to make

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.200 
drying up so I'll be using this to make
a<00:04:03.050> kind<00:04:03.290> of<00:04:03.440> string<00:04:03.770> effect<00:04:04.280> which<00:04:04.760> makes<00:04:04.970> it

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.210 
a kind of string effect which makes it

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.250 
a kind of string effect which makes it
very<00:04:05.420> easy<00:04:05.570> because<00:04:06.140> it<00:04:06.920> is<00:04:06.950> almost<00:04:07.790> dry<00:04:08.260> the

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
very easy because it is almost dry the

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.960 
very easy because it is almost dry the
dryness<00:04:09.530> is<00:04:09.980> the<00:04:10.100> one<00:04:10.280> that<00:04:10.370> makes<00:04:10.580> it<00:04:10.760> a<00:04:10.820> bit

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
dryness is the one that makes it a bit

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:25.990 
dryness is the one that makes it a bit
good<00:04:12.310> repeat<00:04:13.310> this<00:04:13.580> with<00:04:14.030> all<00:04:14.270> the<00:04:14.420> nail<00:04:25.000> now

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000
