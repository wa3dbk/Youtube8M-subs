00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.580
 and greet everyone knows this no 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.990
 how are you listening to me for my 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.820
 Otherwise really great 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.380
 so here is everything new 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.360
 video on my channel as you may have 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.070
 see in title and nature we will 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.380
 find on scolasse so the famous 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.230
 veteran prison boss at the level 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.910
 35 so I'm really happy to 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.170
 propose you to propose this 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.730
 video car wood moors kahn has a lot 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.290
 from among them that they were waiting for him who 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.510
 were waiting for the little strategy etc 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.860
 because bolloc'h certainly there is a very very 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.450
 big community youtube hours draws 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.440
 so we're not a lot but the 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.030
 most have a very very big 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.590
 community but we do not have all the same 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.879
 so that's why today is why 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.500
 I propose this little video so 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.000
 as you will see in front of your eyes 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.309
 right now I'm anti time 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.859
 so I have the role of the guy who is really going 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.969
 take the big sweat school so this 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.140
 that will not really take the big 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.110
 sweat month earlier he's really going to 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.030
 focus almost all the time so on 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.710
 this little video so late on this little 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.870
 earlier gameplay we were crazy about 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.850
 heat at level 365 so back up to 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.050
 background so I took a little day to 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.010
 up to the bottom of my guys so here it 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.170
 there is he really is a fund did 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.370
 really more the castanier well as he 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.720
 so unfortunately there is just one 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.579
 little trick that has put us at a disadvantage 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.619
 it's the famous one sense it's the famous 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:24.210
 inventory on ps3 it's really very 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.619
 very long that's why we also 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.180
 did it so many times so 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.439
 honestly we really spent four 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.869
 hours or even five hours on 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.790
 you will see at the end so 199 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.920
 minutes I let you calculate so 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.210
 so so finally how to say in the end we 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.920
 was really upset honestly no one 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.840
 could really more I had my two 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.579
 pals so galaxy and ghost so two 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.049
 Members of the Mont Blanc that prevailed 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.250
 which they said we're going we're not going to 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.680
 sleep until we have done so 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.820
 we finished it at 3:30 in the morning so the 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.259
 poor honestly I pity them 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.180
 really they go cozy tomorrow morning 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.469
 but good so a huge thank you to you 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.539
 so after so much hard work we have 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:56.640
 finally managed to do it so like you 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:58.170
 could have seen it I was downstairs 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.570
 stairs so with my bubble for 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.740
 really that scola are taking the 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.689
 big on me then my two colleagues 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.590
 were just to my left so upstairs 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.700
 stairs behind the small ones 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.039
 platforms to avoid getting 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.330
 focus because that's really a 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.250
 very good strategy they mark 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.480
 really a lot after really needs to 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.160
 take the right timing simply 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.440
 after if you are on PS3 as I 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.420
 say the inventory is really very very 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.490
 very long it's really it's really 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.020
 relook but good so here I have 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.850
 really looking forward to being on ps4 for at 20 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.840
 for having these inventory bugs for 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.459
 could have 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.620
 this latency as one might say 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.760
 so so in the water clearly 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.989
 today it's really with a big 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.370
 honor that I offer you this video 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.560
 I really hope you like it 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.120
 I hope she will help you so if 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.470
 this is the case say the self in the 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.239
 comments so I know that my tutorial 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.440
 a rox helped some of my 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.660
 subscribers because he sent me a message 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.150
 thank you so I galley and it is so I 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.190
 think of all those criminals who were in 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.780
 rock this for four hours that makes 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.340
 that it did not happen the past I 'm going 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.599
 send my video in advance and then ten 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.310
 minutes after he sent me thank you I 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.140
 managed to beat it like that your video 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.730
 so that really made me 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.799
 great fun so I really hope that 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.150
 this video allow you to achieve 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.190
 these bumps anyway if that's the case 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.329
 it makes me really happy 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.640
 so let's leave you on the 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.959
 defusing the mines so in passing the 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.090
 first mine to defuse I you 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.920
 really advises the layman that the 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.239
 person who must defuse this mini 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.980
 haye a little bit early because 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.150
 it's really pile hair we really 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.230
 the times so as you may have the 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.989
 see we really have some progress 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.650
 the second close and then after so you 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.150
 make your mines really safe so with 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.920
 with tranquility a tranquility 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.519
 Total 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.470
 then you will see that we have 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.450
 rendered in the airlock so happy so 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.829
 we were really proud of ourselves and 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.180
 who got a huge bullshit 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:36.420
 So it is expected in the airlock is 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.310
 was waiting for the opening of this famous 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.810
 this famous room where there is treasure 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.010
 downstairs then we teleported in full 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.090
 middle of the map honestly we do not have 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.470

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.000

 why it happens to us that etc 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.150
 then in the end we could go into 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.750
 the airlock and have access to this prison 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.040
 finally enough to have access to this to those 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.900
