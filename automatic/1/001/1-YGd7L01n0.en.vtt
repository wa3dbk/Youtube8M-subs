external<00:02:27.360> safety<00:02:27.830> I<00:02:28.830> mean<00:02:29.310> it's<00:02:29.490> going<00:02:29.580> to<00:02:29.640> be

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
external safety I mean it's going to be

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.400 
external safety I mean it's going to be
pretty<00:02:29.940> hard<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.270> get<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.720> holster<00:02:31.050> inside

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
pretty hard to get the holster inside

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.720 
pretty hard to get the holster inside
the<00:02:31.620> trigger<00:02:32.660> but<00:02:33.660> if<00:02:33.930> that<00:02:34.200> did<00:02:34.440> happen<00:02:34.730> you'd

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
the trigger but if that did happen you'd

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.640 
the trigger but if that did happen you'd
you'd<00:02:36.540> definitely<00:02:36.690> rather<00:02:37.020> that<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.380> gun<00:02:37.530> was

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
you'd definitely rather that the gun was

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.860 
you'd definitely rather that the gun was
unloaded<00:02:37.850> but<00:02:38.850> you<00:02:39.090> can<00:02:39.240> see<00:02:39.540> just<00:02:39.810> from

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
unloaded but you can see just from

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.500 
unloaded but you can see just from
having<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.320> holster<00:02:40.770> in<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.970> gun<00:02:42.090> holster

this holster about a week ago
the<00:03:05.220> gun<00:03:05.400> would<00:03:05.610> barely<00:03:05.910> slide<00:03:06.300> in<00:03:06.450> here<00:03:06.630> I'd

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
the gun would barely slide in here I'd

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.230 
the gun would barely slide in here I'd
have<00:03:06.840> to<00:03:06.960> push<00:03:07.200> really<00:03:07.620> hard<00:03:07.860> and<00:03:08.730> when<00:03:08.880> I<00:03:08.910> did

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
have to push really hard and when I did

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.350 
have to push really hard and when I did
it<00:03:09.750> would<00:03:09.960> actually<00:03:10.860> bring<00:03:11.520> the<00:03:11.670> slide<00:03:11.970> back<00:03:12.330> a

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
it would actually bring the slide back a

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.750 
it would actually bring the slide back a
little<00:03:12.810> bit<00:03:12.960> it<00:03:13.140> was<00:03:13.260> that<00:03:13.470> tight<00:03:13.800> and<00:03:14.460> now<00:03:14.700> you

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
little bit it was that tight and now you

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.670 
little bit it was that tight and now you
can<00:03:15.060> see<00:03:15.360> that<00:03:15.660> I<00:03:15.870> still<00:03:16.020> have<00:03:16.140> to<00:03:16.230> push<00:03:16.440> pretty

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
can see that I still have to push pretty

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.120 
can see that I still have to push pretty
hard<00:03:16.770> to<00:03:17.070> holster<00:03:17.550> but<00:03:18.650> the<00:03:19.650> slides<00:03:20.310> perfectly

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
hard to holster but the slides perfectly

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.800

engaged and locked with the rest of the
pistol<00:03:25.760> but<00:03:26.760> eventually<00:03:27.360> it<00:03:27.780> will<00:03:27.960> have<00:03:28.230> a<00:03:28.260> lot

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
pistol but eventually it will have a lot

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.190 
pistol but eventually it will have a lot
better<00:03:29.040> fit<00:03:29.490> a<00:03:29.910> lot<00:03:30.240> looser<00:03:30.450> fit<00:03:30.840> but<00:03:30.990> it<00:03:31.080> will

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
better fit a lot looser fit but it will

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.840 
better fit a lot looser fit but it will
still<00:03:31.500> have<00:03:31.740> much<00:03:31.950> more<00:03:32.190> attention<00:03:32.490> than<00:03:32.700> the

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
bell clip is positioned so high on the

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.730 
bell clip is positioned so high on the
holster<00:04:24.970> that<00:04:25.630> it's<00:04:26.110> almost<00:04:26.380> going<00:04:26.590> to<00:04:26.650> have

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
holster that it's almost going to have

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.070 
holster that it's almost going to have
the<00:04:26.830> entire<00:04:27.250> handle<00:04:27.790> down<00:04:27.940> inside<00:04:28.540> my<00:04:28.810> waist

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
the entire handle down inside my waist

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.800 
the entire handle down inside my waist
bit<00:04:29.320> so<00:04:30.040> I<00:04:30.340> mean<00:04:30.520> it<00:04:30.880> could<00:04:31.150> be<00:04:31.300> better<00:04:31.510> for<00:04:31.630> a

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
bit so I mean it could be better for a

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.900 
bit so I mean it could be better for a
concealment<00:04:32.170> depending<00:04:32.740> on<00:04:32.860> which<00:04:33.280> position

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
concealment depending on which position

in your body you actually wear it or it

in your body you actually wear it or it
