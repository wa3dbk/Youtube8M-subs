or Specter or mp5 and then there's the
other<00:02:32.099> way<00:02:32.310> which<00:02:32.700> is<00:02:32.730> camping<00:02:33.510> in<00:02:33.629> the<00:02:33.750> back

do<00:03:48.299> is<00:03:48.510> rush<00:03:49.139> up<00:03:49.440> into<00:03:50.010> the<00:03:50.129> back<00:03:50.250> of<00:03:50.400> this

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
do is rush up into the back of this

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.020 
do is rush up into the back of this
spawn<00:03:50.760> and<00:03:51.120> work<00:03:51.389> from<00:03:51.569> the<00:03:51.750> back<00:03:51.989> up<00:03:53.030> so

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
spawn and work from the back up so

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.119 
spawn and work from the back up so
you'll<00:03:54.329> clear<00:03:54.690> out<00:03:54.870> people<00:03:55.500> and<00:03:55.650> you'll<00:03:55.949> never

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.129 
you'll clear out people and you'll never

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:00.009 
you'll clear out people and you'll never
miss<00:03:56.459> anyone<00:03:56.930> this<00:03:57.930> way<00:03:58.169> you<00:03:58.980> won't<00:03:59.699> go<00:03:59.970> past

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
miss anyone this way you won't go past

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.990 
miss anyone this way you won't go past
people<00:04:01.019> you<00:04:01.199> won't<00:04:01.379> go<00:04:01.500> past<00:04:01.530> claymores<00:04:02.370> you

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
people you won't go past claymores you

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.030 
people you won't go past claymores you
clear<00:04:03.329> them<00:04:03.449> all<00:04:03.629> out<00:04:03.660> as<00:04:04.019> you<00:04:04.500> go<00:04:04.530> you<00:04:04.709> won't

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
clear them all out as you go you won't

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.430 
clear them all out as you go you won't
tend<00:04:05.370> to<00:04:05.489> miss<00:04:05.699> any<00:04:05.940> opportunities<00:04:06.900> for<00:04:07.199> kills

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
tend to miss any opportunities for kills

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.789 
tend to miss any opportunities for kills
unless<00:04:08.340> of<00:04:08.549> course<00:04:08.579> you<00:04:09.000> do<00:04:09.150> die<00:04:09.419> which<00:04:10.199> you'll

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
unless of course you do die which you'll

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.009 
unless of course you do die which you'll
see<00:04:11.040> a<00:04:11.069> couple<00:04:11.310> of<00:04:11.430> times<00:04:11.579> in<00:04:11.760> this<00:04:11.910> video<00:04:12.090> but

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
see a couple of times in this video but

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.500 
see a couple of times in this video but
i<00:04:13.230> do<00:04:13.319> get<00:04:13.680> 16<00:04:14.220> kills<00:04:14.489> in<00:04:14.669> the<00:04:14.790> process<00:04:15.209> so

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
i do get 16 kills in the process so

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.949 
i do get 16 kills in the process so
that's<00:04:15.870> a<00:04:16.019> 5<00:04:16.349> point<00:04:16.769> something<00:04:17.099> KD<00:04:17.669> and<00:04:17.959> i

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
that's a 5 point something KD and i

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.050 
that's a 5 point something KD and i
reckon<00:04:19.260> that's<00:04:19.409> pretty<00:04:19.680> good<00:04:19.829> for<00:04:19.890> for<00:04:20.849> a

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
reckon that's pretty good for for a

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.480 
reckon that's pretty good for for a
search-and-destroy<00:04:21.510> match<00:04:21.979> after<00:04:22.979> just

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
search-and-destroy match after just

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:24.530 
search-and-destroy match after just
prestiging

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
prestiging

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.620 
prestiging
so<00:04:24.950> this<00:04:25.950> is<00:04:26.280> a<00:04:26.340> very<00:04:26.730> very<00:04:26.910> quick<00:04:27.450> way<00:04:27.600> to

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
so this is a very very quick way to

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.510 
so this is a very very quick way to
prestige<00:04:28.140> place<00:04:28.620> search<00:04:28.890> and<00:04:29.040> destroy<00:04:29.160> all

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
prestige place search and destroy all

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.000 
prestige place search and destroy all
that<00:04:29.580> long<00:04:30.150> and<00:04:30.360> like<00:04:31.230> even<00:04:31.470> for<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:31.830> highest

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
that long and like even for the highest

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.370 
that long and like even for the highest
level<00:04:32.400> of<00:04:32.430> the<00:04:32.640> high<00:04:32.910> 40<00:04:33.300> you'll<00:04:33.870> only<00:04:34.110> need

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
level of the high 40 you'll only need

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.470 
level of the high 40 you'll only need
for<00:04:34.770> good<00:04:35.070> matches<00:04:35.460> of<00:04:35.580> snd<00:04:35.940> to<00:04:36.150> go<00:04:36.270> through

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
for good matches of snd to go through

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.740 
for good matches of snd to go through
one<00:04:36.720> level<00:04:37.050> and<00:04:37.200> if<00:04:37.980> you<00:04:38.190> win<00:04:38.640> say<00:04:39.000> for<00:04:39.480> Neil

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
one level and if you win say for Neil

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.600 
one level and if you win say for Neil
that<00:04:39.960> could<00:04:40.170> be<00:04:40.290> like<00:04:40.650> five<00:04:40.980> minutes<00:04:41.250> if

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
that could be like five minutes if

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.820 
that could be like five minutes if
you're<00:04:42.090> rushing<00:04:42.510> a<00:04:42.630> five<00:04:43.230> minute<00:04:43.530> match<00:04:43.680> of

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
you're rushing a five minute match of

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.980 
you're rushing a five minute match of
SMD<00:04:44.190> tons<00:04:44.490> for<00:04:44.760> that's<00:04:45.000> 20<00:04:45.360> minutes<00:04:45.630> for<00:04:45.840> one

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
SMD tons for that's 20 minutes for one

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.580 
SMD tons for that's 20 minutes for one
level<00:04:46.380> and<00:04:47.480> they're<00:04:48.480> there<00:04:49.020> the<00:04:49.200> average

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
level and they're there the average

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.650 
level and they're there the average
games<00:04:49.830> average<00:04:50.250> games<00:04:50.520> you<00:04:50.700> might<00:04:50.850> earn<00:04:51.150> eight

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
games average games you might earn eight

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.560 
games average games you might earn eight
kills<00:04:52.050> maybe<00:04:52.380> and<00:04:52.710> so<00:04:53.670> that's<00:04:54.120> just<00:04:54.270> a<00:04:54.540> quick

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
kills maybe and so that's just a quick

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.680 
kills maybe and so that's just a quick
way<00:04:54.960> to<00:04:54.990> level<00:04:55.260> up<00:04:55.530> for<00:04:56.190> you<00:04:56.280> guys<00:04:56.540> pro<00:04:57.540> tip
