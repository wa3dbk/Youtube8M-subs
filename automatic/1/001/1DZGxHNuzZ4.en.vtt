00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
and maybe I ate but that was all I did I

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.280 
and maybe I ate but that was all I did I
didn't<00:00:38.670> see<00:00:38.730> any<00:00:38.940> more<00:00:39.059> now<00:00:39.239> okay<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:39.899> lied

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
didn't see any more now okay I lied

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.660 
didn't see any more now okay I lied
maybe<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.680> had<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.860> glass<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.100> milk<00:00:41.399> with<00:00:41.520> my

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
maybe I had a glass of milk with my

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.319 
maybe I had a glass of milk with my
cookies

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
cookies

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.170 
cookies
it<00:00:42.750> was<00:00:42.870> hard<00:00:43.219> over<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.309> past<00:00:44.340> few<00:00:44.789> weeks<00:00:44.850> I

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
it was hard over the past few weeks I

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.090 
it was hard over the past few weeks I
haven't<00:00:45.360> felt<00:00:45.600> any<00:00:45.870> healthier<00:00:46.410> really<00:00:46.829> I

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
haven't felt any healthier really I

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.860 
haven't felt any healthier really I
think<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.700> biggest<00:00:47.910> issue<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.719> have

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
think the biggest issue is that I have

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.040 
think the biggest issue is that I have
not<00:00:49.079> been<00:00:49.140> exercising<00:00:49.950> enough<00:00:50.370> like<00:00:51.050> not

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
not been exercising enough like not

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.010 
not been exercising enough like not
really<00:00:52.500> at<00:00:52.620> all<00:00:52.739> I'm<00:00:53.190> really<00:00:53.399> starting<00:00:53.910> to

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
really at all I'm really starting to

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.410 
really at all I'm really starting to
resent<00:00:55.020> these<00:00:55.530> challenges<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:56.879> think<00:00:57.180> I

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
resent these challenges so I think I

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.610 
resent these challenges so I think I
need<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.600> make<00:00:57.780> them<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:58.020> little<00:00:58.230> bit<00:00:58.350> easier

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
need to make them a little bit easier

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.790 
need to make them a little bit easier
and<00:00:58.859> just<00:00:58.949> force<00:00:59.879> myself<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.629> work<00:01:00.899> out<00:01:01.079> so

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
and just force myself to work out so

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.830 
and just force myself to work out so
that<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:01.980> start<00:01:02.219> feeling<00:01:02.489> healthier<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.629> more

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
that I start feeling healthier and more

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.380 
that I start feeling healthier and more
energized<00:01:04.580> so<00:01:05.580> this<00:01:06.180> upcoming<00:01:06.360> week<00:01:06.810> will<00:01:07.080> be

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
energized so this upcoming week will be

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.370 
energized so this upcoming week will be
null<00:01:09.390> fried<00:01:09.720> fooled<00:01:11.720> it's<00:01:12.720> kind<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.049> generic

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
null fried fooled it's kind of generic

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.260 
null fried fooled it's kind of generic
and<00:01:13.680> it's<00:01:13.770> not<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.100> hard<00:01:14.340> if<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:14.939> make<00:01:15.119> the

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
and it's not that hard if I make the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.820 
and it's not that hard if I make the
challenge<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.630> little<00:01:15.720> bit<00:01:15.960> easier<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.439> feel

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
like I won't resent it as much and I

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.030
