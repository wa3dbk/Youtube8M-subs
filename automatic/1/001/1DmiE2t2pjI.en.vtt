wood-burning many years ago as you can
also<00:00:34.489> see<00:00:34.640> that<00:00:34.789> there's<00:00:35.059> two<00:00:35.120> aluminum

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
also see that there's two aluminum

also see that there's two aluminum
ductwork<00:00:35.929> one<00:00:36.199> would<00:00:36.350> be<00:00:36.440> the<00:00:36.559> intake<00:00:36.890> a

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
ductwork one would be the intake a

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.919 
ductwork one would be the intake a
moment<00:00:37.250> maybe<00:00:37.339> output<00:00:37.820> as<00:00:38.000> well<00:00:38.510> as<00:00:38.629> a<00:00:38.660> gas

00:00:38.919 --> 00:00:38.929 
moment maybe output as well as a gas

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:42.729 
moment maybe output as well as a gas

unit<00:00:43.129> that<00:00:43.190> we've<00:00:43.309> actually<00:00:43.460> installed<00:00:44.030> here

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
unit that we've actually installed here

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:45.970 
unit that we've actually installed here
previous<00:00:44.690> to<00:00:44.839> our<00:00:44.989> current<00:00:45.230> renovation<00:00:45.769> so

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
previous to our current renovation so

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.009 
previous to our current renovation so
there<00:00:46.159> we<00:00:46.640> will<00:00:46.820> be<00:00:46.969> reusing<00:00:47.329> the<00:00:47.539> fireplace

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019 
there we will be reusing the fireplace

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:49.989 
there we will be reusing the fireplace
we've<00:00:48.230> just<00:00:48.379> taking<00:00:48.679> it<00:00:48.800> out<00:00:48.909> during<00:00:49.909> the

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:49.999 
we've just taking it out during the

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:51.310 
we've just taking it out during the
construction<00:00:50.210> process<00:00:50.539> as<00:00:50.960> you<00:00:51.050> can<00:00:51.170> see

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
construction process as you can see

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.899 
construction process as you can see
everything's<00:00:51.589> under<00:00:51.800> work<00:00:51.980> here<00:00:52.249> but

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:52.909 
everything's under work here but

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:55.209 
everything's under work here but
basically<00:00:53.420> the<00:00:53.600> key<00:00:53.809> points<00:00:54.260> to<00:00:54.440> realize<00:00:54.859> are

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
basically the key points to realize are

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:57.729 
basically the key points to realize are
that<00:00:55.839> everything<00:00:56.839> in<00:00:57.109> a<00:00:57.260> fireplace

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
that everything in a fireplace

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:58.809 
that everything in a fireplace
especially<00:00:58.280> when<00:00:58.370> it's<00:00:58.489> a<00:00:58.519> wood-burning

00:00:58.809 --> 00:00:58.819 
especially when it's a wood-burning

00:00:58.819 --> 00:01:01.689 
especially when it's a wood-burning
fireplace<00:00:59.530> needs<00:01:00.530> to<00:01:00.769> be<00:01:00.949> non<00:01:01.309> combustible

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
fireplace needs to be non combustible

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:03.759 
fireplace needs to be non combustible
material<00:01:02.390> so<00:01:02.989> what<00:01:03.140> they<00:01:03.229> do<00:01:03.289> is<00:01:03.530> they<00:01:03.620> have

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
material so what they do is they have

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:05.290 
material so what they do is they have
all<00:01:03.949> the<00:01:04.070> special<00:01:04.280> fire<00:01:04.670> brick<00:01:04.940> that<00:01:05.090> runs

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
all the special fire brick that runs

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.330 
all the special fire brick that runs
around<00:01:05.480> on<00:01:05.930> all<00:01:06.320> fours<00:01:06.380> they're<00:01:06.890> all<00:01:07.010> three

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
around on all fours they're all three

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.400 
around on all fours they're all three
sides<00:01:07.580> as<00:01:07.760> well<00:01:07.940> as<00:01:08.060> the<00:01:08.150> bottom<00:01:08.330> and<00:01:09.290> they

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:09.410 
sides as well as the bottom and they

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.610 
sides as well as the bottom and they
have<00:01:09.590> the<00:01:09.830> damper<00:01:10.760> up<00:01:10.880> top<00:01:11.150> to<00:01:12.110> allow<00:01:12.290> all<00:01:12.470> the

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:12.620 
have the damper up top to allow all the

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.670 
have the damper up top to allow all the
the<00:01:12.980> fumes<00:01:13.700> to<00:01:13.880> escape<00:01:14.210> when<00:01:14.840> we<00:01:15.020> do<00:01:15.200> a<00:01:15.230> gas

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
the fumes to escape when we do a gas

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.070 
the fumes to escape when we do a gas
fireplace<00:01:16.070> conversion<00:01:17.060> however<00:01:17.480> we<00:01:17.660> actually

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
fireplace conversion however we actually

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.080 
fireplace conversion however we actually
have<00:01:18.200> to<00:01:18.350> put<00:01:18.380> a<00:01:18.560> special<00:01:18.830> aluminum<00:01:19.670> liner

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
have to put a special aluminum liner

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.600 
have to put a special aluminum liner
right<00:01:20.930> up<00:01:21.110> the<00:01:21.260> chimney<00:01:21.530> and<00:01:21.860> that's<00:01:22.400> what

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
right up the chimney and that's what

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.800 
right up the chimney and that's what
these<00:01:22.700> two<00:01:22.760> aluminum<00:01:23.300> duct<00:01:23.450> works<00:01:23.660> actually

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
these two aluminum duct works actually

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.750 
these two aluminum duct works actually
run<00:01:24.080> up<00:01:24.170> inside<00:01:24.530> so<00:01:24.740> it's<00:01:24.920> not<00:01:25.100> just<00:01:25.460> the<00:01:25.580> bare

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
run up inside so it's not just the bare

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.280 
run up inside so it's not just the bare
brick<00:01:26.030> like<00:01:26.210> it<00:01:26.330> would<00:01:26.450> have<00:01:26.540> been<00:01:26.660> an<00:01:26.870> old<00:01:26.990> gas

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
brick like it would have been an old gas

brick like it would have been an old gas
fireplace<00:01:27.830> there's<00:01:28.400> a<00:01:28.460> special<00:01:29.090> liner<00:01:29.270> that

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:29.480 
fireplace there's a special liner that

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.420 
fireplace there's a special liner that
runs<00:01:29.660> up<00:01:29.870> that's<00:01:30.620> the<00:01:30.800> first<00:01:31.010> thing<00:01:31.190> to<00:01:31.280> point

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
runs up that's the first thing to point

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:32.680 
runs up that's the first thing to point
out<00:01:31.520> the<00:01:31.640> other<00:01:31.790> thing<00:01:31.970> to<00:01:32.060> point<00:01:32.240> out<00:01:32.330> is<00:01:32.510> that

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
out the other thing to point out is that

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.000 
out the other thing to point out is that
because<00:01:32.750> this<00:01:33.200> is<00:01:33.260> all<00:01:33.500> non<00:01:33.680> combustible

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
because this is all non combustible

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.030 
because this is all non combustible
material<00:01:34.580> inside<00:01:35.060> to<00:01:35.750> meet<00:01:35.930> code<00:01:36.320> we<00:01:36.620> actually

material inside to meet code we actually

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.980 
material inside to meet code we actually
have<00:01:37.190> to<00:01:37.370> make<00:01:37.520> non<00:01:37.790> combustible<00:01:38.210> material<00:01:38.810> on

have to make non combustible material on
the<00:01:39.110> outside<00:01:39.220> so<00:01:40.220> what<00:01:40.370> that's<00:01:40.520> going<00:01:40.790> to

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
the outside so what that's going to

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.590 
the outside so what that's going to
require<00:01:41.030> is<00:01:41.600> as<00:01:41.900> right<00:01:42.080> now<00:01:42.110> we<00:01:42.290> just<00:01:42.560> have<00:01:43.130> the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
require is as right now we just have the

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.270 
require is as right now we just have the
floor<00:01:44.600> joist<00:01:44.870> running<00:01:45.320> perpendicular<00:01:45.620> to<00:01:46.130> the

floor joist running perpendicular to the

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.320 
floor joist running perpendicular to the
fireplace<00:01:46.490> and<00:01:46.940> we've<00:01:47.060> got<00:01:47.210> our

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
fireplace and we've got our

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.540 
fireplace and we've got our
three-quarter<00:01:47.840> inch<00:01:47.960> plywood<00:01:48.550> running

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
three-quarter inch plywood running

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.570 
three-quarter inch plywood running
continuous<00:01:50.000> across<00:01:50.270> to<00:01:50.930> make<00:01:51.080> this<00:01:51.440> meet<00:01:52.250> code

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
continuous across to make this meet code

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.100 
continuous across to make this meet code
what<00:01:52.820> we<00:01:52.910> actually<00:01:53.060> have<00:01:53.390> to<00:01:53.420> do<00:01:53.690> is<00:01:53.840> we<00:01:53.960> have

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
what we actually have to do is we have

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.340 
what we actually have to do is we have
to<00:01:54.140> cut<00:01:54.500> back<00:01:54.530> the<00:01:54.980> plywood<00:01:55.460> on<00:01:55.580> either<00:01:55.820> side

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
to cut back the plywood on either side

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.620 
to cut back the plywood on either side
to<00:01:57.350> match<00:01:57.830> our<00:01:58.040> minimum<00:01:58.460> of<00:01:58.640> 16<00:01:59.090> inches<00:01:59.360> from

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
to match our minimum of 16 inches from

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.590 
to match our minimum of 16 inches from
the<00:01:59.780> nearest<00:02:00.110> point<00:02:00.320> of<00:02:00.830> combustion<00:02:01.490> so<00:02:02.300> about

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
the nearest point of combustion so about

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.960 
the nearest point of combustion so about
six<00:02:02.840> inches<00:02:03.170> that<00:02:03.380> way<00:02:03.560> and<00:02:04.070> 16<00:02:04.550> inches<00:02:04.760> that

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
six inches that way and 16 inches that

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.180 
six inches that way and 16 inches that
way<00:02:05.120> as<00:02:05.360> well<00:02:05.540> as<00:02:05.690> 16<00:02:06.080> inches<00:02:06.200> out<00:02:06.530> in<00:02:06.740> front

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
way as well as 16 inches out in front

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.240 
way as well as 16 inches out in front
remove<00:02:07.790> the<00:02:08.000> plywood<00:02:08.570> and<00:02:08.750> then<00:02:09.290> on<00:02:09.800> top<00:02:10.100> of

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
remove the plywood and then on top of

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.310 
remove the plywood and then on top of
the<00:02:10.340> joist<00:02:10.550> we<00:02:10.880> have<00:02:11.030> to<00:02:11.180> lay<00:02:11.300> a<00:02:11.330> layer<00:02:12.080> of

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
the joist we have to lay a layer of

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.100 
the joist we have to lay a layer of
special<00:02:13.070> galvanized<00:02:13.970> sheet<00:02:14.000> metal<00:02:14.570> which

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
special galvanized sheet metal which

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.600 
special galvanized sheet metal which
will<00:02:15.260> may<00:02:15.410> write<00:02:15.590> across<00:02:15.800> the<00:02:16.070> joists<00:02:16.280> which

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
will may write across the joists which

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.280 
will may write across the joists which
is<00:02:16.760> again<00:02:17.000> non<00:02:17.240> combustible<00:02:17.540> material<00:02:18.110> and

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
is again non combustible material and

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.600 
is again non combustible material and
then<00:02:18.710> on<00:02:18.830> top<00:02:18.980> of<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.160> sheet<00:02:19.340> metal<00:02:19.520> we

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
then on top of the sheet metal we

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.120 
then on top of the sheet metal we
actually<00:02:19.910> place<00:02:20.560> half-inch<00:02:21.560> cement<00:02:21.920> board

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
actually place half-inch cement board

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.010 
actually place half-inch cement board
which<00:02:22.310> again<00:02:22.550> non<00:02:22.760> combustible<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:23.810> that

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
which again non combustible and that

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.560 
which again non combustible and that
adds<00:02:24.320> a<00:02:24.710> proper<00:02:25.130> barrier<00:02:25.550> of<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:26.090> heat<00:02:26.360> and

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
adds a proper barrier of the heat and

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.390 
adds a proper barrier of the heat and
everything<00:02:26.990> in<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.230> fireplace<00:02:27.680> from<00:02:27.980> from

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
everything in the fireplace from from

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.150 
everything in the fireplace from from
turning<00:02:29.120> anything<00:02:29.680> outside<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:30.740> the

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
turning anything outside the the

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.900 
turning anything outside the the
fireplace<00:02:31.820> into<00:02:32.060> firewood<00:02:32.600> so<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:34.310> key<00:02:34.520> thing

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
fireplace into firewood so the key thing

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.690 
fireplace into firewood so the key thing
here<00:02:34.940> is<00:02:35.330> that<00:02:35.360> we<00:02:35.600> have<00:02:35.840> to<00:02:36.280> basically<00:02:37.280> make

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
here is that we have to basically make

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.070 
here is that we have to basically make
everything<00:02:37.970> out<00:02:38.300> front<00:02:38.750> of<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:38.870> gas

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
everything out front of the gas

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.750 
everything out front of the gas
fireplace<00:02:39.380> non<00:02:39.770> combustible<00:02:40.070> the<00:02:40.340> reason

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
fireplace non combustible the reason

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.730 
fireplace non combustible the reason
being<00:02:40.940> not<00:02:41.360> so<00:02:41.540> much<00:02:41.690> because<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:42.590> gas

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
being not so much because the gas

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.590 
being not so much because the gas
fireplace<00:02:43.100> itself<00:02:43.760> could<00:02:44.030> set<00:02:44.210> this<00:02:44.330> all<00:02:44.510> on

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
fireplace itself could set this all on

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.870 
fireplace itself could set this all on
fire<00:02:44.840> because<00:02:45.170> really<00:02:45.350> those<00:02:45.590> gas<00:02:46.310> fireplaces

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
fire because really those gas fireplaces

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.640 
fire because really those gas fireplaces
don't<00:02:47.270> actually<00:02:47.450> put<00:02:47.840> out<00:02:47.960> as<00:02:48.170> much<00:02:48.320> heat

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
don't actually put out as much heat

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.920 
don't actually put out as much heat
outward<00:02:49.280> as<00:02:49.460> a<00:02:49.760> wood-burning<00:02:50.150> fireplace<00:02:50.330> does

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
outward as a wood-burning fireplace does

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.430 
outward as a wood-burning fireplace does
the<00:02:51.470> concern<00:02:51.920> is<00:02:52.130> that<00:02:52.310> if<00:02:52.730> somebody<00:02:53.480> if<00:02:54.260> the

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
the concern is that if somebody if the

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.930 
the concern is that if somebody if the
house<00:02:54.620> if<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:55.010> homeowner<00:02:55.310> decided<00:02:55.670> at<00:02:55.880> a

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
house if the homeowner decided at a

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.120 
house if the homeowner decided at a
later<00:02:56.120> date<00:02:56.360> to<00:02:56.570> remove<00:02:57.440> the<00:02:57.560> gas<00:02:57.740> fireplace

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
later date to remove the gas fireplace

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.100 
later date to remove the gas fireplace
and<00:02:58.460> turn<00:02:58.880> this<00:02:59.000> back<00:02:59.210> into<00:02:59.240> a<00:02:59.660> wood-burning

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
and turn this back into a wood-burning

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.230 
and turn this back into a wood-burning
fireplace<00:03:00.260> or<00:03:00.920> if<00:03:01.400> they<00:03:01.520> sold<00:03:01.790> a<00:03:01.850> house<00:03:02.000> and

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
fireplace or if they sold a house and

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.000 
fireplace or if they sold a house and
the<00:03:02.300> future<00:03:02.630> owners<00:03:02.960> decide<00:03:03.290> to<00:03:03.410> do<00:03:03.530> so<00:03:03.770> if

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
the future owners decide to do so if

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.680 
the future owners decide to do so if
they<00:03:04.610> wanted<00:03:04.970> to<00:03:05.090> use<00:03:05.330> this<00:03:05.510> as<00:03:05.570> a

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
they wanted to use this as a

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.870 
they wanted to use this as a
wood-burning<00:03:05.960> fireplace<00:03:06.110> again<00:03:07.040> this<00:03:07.520> front

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
wood-burning fireplace again this front

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.430 
wood-burning fireplace again this front
area<00:03:08.210> would<00:03:08.450> need<00:03:08.630> to<00:03:08.750> would<00:03:09.020> need<00:03:09.140> to<00:03:09.290> meet

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
area would need to would need to meet

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.470 
area would need to would need to meet
code<00:03:09.770> so<00:03:10.160> they<00:03:10.700> would<00:03:10.850> have<00:03:10.970> to<00:03:11.120> be<00:03:11.239> all<00:03:11.300> non

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
code so they would have to be all non

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.150 
code so they would have to be all non
combustible<00:03:11.780> that's<00:03:12.200> the<00:03:12.380> primary<00:03:12.800> concern

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
combustible that's the primary concern

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.310 
combustible that's the primary concern
we<00:03:13.310> can't<00:03:13.550> just<00:03:13.850> assume<00:03:14.330> that<00:03:14.810> it<00:03:14.959> will<00:03:15.080> always

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
we can't just assume that it will always

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.290 
we can't just assume that it will always
be<00:03:15.620> a<00:03:15.650> gas<00:03:15.860> fireplace<00:03:16.400> and<00:03:16.430> that's<00:03:16.730> why<00:03:16.970> you're

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
be a gas fireplace and that's why you're

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.510 
be a gas fireplace and that's why you're
okay<00:03:17.750> to<00:03:17.810> have<00:03:18.020> any<00:03:18.350> combustible<00:03:19.160> material

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520 
okay to have any combustible material

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.760 
okay to have any combustible material
out<00:03:19.580> here<00:03:19.790> so<00:03:20.030> the<00:03:20.930> key<00:03:21.140> points<00:03:21.530> to<00:03:21.650> consider

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
out here so the key points to consider
