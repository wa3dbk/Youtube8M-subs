00:01:04.290 --> 00:02:20.500 

I<00:01:05.180> have<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.330> manually<00:01:06.720> set<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.380> z-axis

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:27.230 

and<00:02:21.510> that's<00:02:21.870> that<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:23.690> lucky<00:02:24.690> pattern<00:02:26.240> the

and that's that the lucky pattern the

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.420 
and that's that the lucky pattern the
love<00:02:27.420> you<00:02:27.540> pattern<00:02:30.260> it's<00:02:31.260> not<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.830> greatest

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
love you pattern it's not the greatest

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.520 
love you pattern it's not the greatest
resolution<00:02:33.360> in<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.510> world<00:02:33.720> but<00:02:33.990> I'm<00:02:34.080> working

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
resolution in the world but I'm working

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.840 
resolution in the world but I'm working
on<00:02:34.650> it<00:02:34.710> got<00:02:35.580> a<00:02:35.610> few<00:02:35.850> things<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:36.840> iron<00:02:37.110> out<00:02:37.410> and

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
on it got a few things to iron out and

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.300 
on it got a few things to iron out and
of<00:02:38.850> course<00:02:39.090> build<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.420> z-axis<00:02:39.600> and<00:02:40.350> that<00:02:41.220> is

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
of course build the z-axis and that is

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.700 
of course build the z-axis and that is
when<00:02:41.490> I<00:02:41.520> will<00:02:41.820> add<00:02:42.030> my<00:02:42.390> cheap<00:02:43.110> rotary<00:02:43.530> tool

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
when I will add my cheap rotary tool

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.150 
when I will add my cheap rotary tool
from<00:02:43.950> Harbor<00:02:44.250> Freight<00:02:44.450> just<00:02:45.450> cost<00:02:45.720> all<00:02:45.930> of

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
from Harbor Freight just cost all of

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.560 
from Harbor Freight just cost all of
three<00:02:47.160> and<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:47.430> half<00:02:47.610> dollars<00:02:49.370> a<00:02:50.370> tire<00:02:51.030> project

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
three and a half dollars a tire project

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.530 
three and a half dollars a tire project
it<00:02:51.690> cost<00:02:51.960> about<00:02:52.140> 90<00:02:52.620> bucks<00:02:52.910> so<00:02:53.910> hopefully<00:02:54.510> I

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
it cost about 90 bucks so hopefully I

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.830 
it cost about 90 bucks so hopefully I
can<00:02:54.750> do<00:02:55.290> something<00:02:55.560> with<00:02:55.800> it
