actually<00:01:46.100> no<00:01:46.580> I<00:01:46.790> think<00:01:47.180> I<00:01:47.390> can<00:01:47.630> see<00:01:47.899> a<00:01:47.930> spot<00:01:48.290> for

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
actually no I think I can see a spot for

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.969 
actually no I think I can see a spot for
it<00:01:50.860> and<00:01:51.860> they<00:01:52.460> go<00:01:52.899> perfect<00:01:53.899> spot<00:01:54.259> just<00:01:54.710> here

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
it and they go perfect spot just here

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.420 
it and they go perfect spot just here
big<00:01:55.970> Road

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.520 

now<00:02:00.060> what<00:02:00.420> we're<00:02:00.540> going<00:02:00.660> to<00:02:00.690> do<00:02:00.870> is<00:02:00.990> change<00:02:01.260> the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
now what we're going to do is change the

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.380 
now what we're going to do is change the
rotation<00:02:02.270> which<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.300> that<00:02:03.660> one<00:02:03.810> right<00:02:04.910> to<00:02:05.910> 180

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
rotation which is that one right to 180

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.350 
rotation which is that one right to 180
that<00:02:06.780> isn't<00:02:07.170> enough<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:08.070> we'll<00:02:08.220> try<00:02:08.430> 200<00:02:09.210> we

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
that isn't enough so we'll try 200 we

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:20.200 
that isn't enough so we'll try 200 we
want<00:02:09.570> straight<00:02:12.020> so<00:02:13.020> you'll<00:02:13.260> have<00:02:13.380> to<00:02:13.590> be<00:02:13.740> 190

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.559 

so

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
so

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.209 
so
but<00:02:23.110> this<00:02:23.290> is<00:02:23.469> a<00:02:23.500> bit<00:02:23.980> slide<00:02:25.079> G<00:02:26.079> for<00:02:26.409> grab<00:02:26.739> to

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:27.219 
but this is a bit slide G for grab to

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:32.699 
but this is a bit slide G for grab to
grab<00:02:27.489> it<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:27.819> push<00:02:28.030> it<00:02:28.060> back<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:32.200> there<00:02:32.379> we<00:02:32.530> go

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
grab it and push it back and there we go

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:41.839 
grab it and push it back and there we go
I<00:02:33.430> would<00:02:34.709> yeah<00:02:35.739> so<00:02:36.549> which

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:46.619 

so<00:02:43.430> good

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:49.800 

or<00:02:46.959> place<00:02:47.290> that<00:02:47.879> just<00:02:48.879> add<00:02:49.269> a<00:02:49.299> couple<00:02:49.629> of<00:02:49.749> more

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
or place that just add a couple of more

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.199 
or place that just add a couple of more
so<00:02:50.349> we<00:02:50.620> want<00:02:50.799> it<00:02:50.859> as<00:02:51.040> close<00:02:51.340> as<00:02:51.370> straight<00:02:52.060> as

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
so we want it as close as straight as

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.099 
so we want it as close as straight as
possible

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:03:01.559 

let's<00:02:56.109> try<00:02:56.409> one<00:02:56.680> nine<00:02:56.950> two<00:02:57.340> I<00:02:59.790> see<00:03:00.790> that's<00:03:01.329> the

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
let's try one nine two I see that's the

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:06.000 
let's try one nine two I see that's the
problem<00:03:01.810> with<00:03:02.079> this<00:03:02.909> item<00:03:03.909> here<00:03:04.680> it's<00:03:05.680> not

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
problem with this item here it's not

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.550 
problem with this item here it's not
always<00:03:06.430> gonna<00:03:06.670> fit<00:03:07.030> that<00:03:07.389> perfect<00:03:08.079> but<00:03:08.379> we<00:03:08.530> can

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
always gonna fit that perfect but we can

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:17.740 
always gonna fit that perfect but we can
make<00:03:08.709> it<00:03:09.069> first<00:03:09.370> as<00:03:09.519> possible

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.410 

and<00:03:18.290> there<00:03:18.530> you<00:03:18.650> go<00:03:18.830> it's<00:03:19.040> placed<00:03:19.370> now<00:03:20.150> what

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
and there you go it's placed now what

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.820 
and there you go it's placed now what
we're<00:03:20.570> gonna<00:03:20.690> do<00:03:20.930> is<00:03:21.230> I'm<00:03:21.440> going<00:03:21.530> to<00:03:21.620> quickly

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
we're gonna do is I'm going to quickly

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:28.540 
we're gonna do is I'm going to quickly
just<00:03:23.680> make<00:03:24.680> it<00:03:26.170> look<00:03:27.170> as<00:03:27.350> if<00:03:27.380> this<00:03:27.740> is<00:03:28.340> off<00:03:28.520> a

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
just make it look as if this is off a

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.250 
just make it look as if this is off a
pathway<00:03:29.000> it's<00:03:29.360> not<00:03:29.570> going<00:03:29.810> it's<00:03:30.050> not<00:03:30.230> a

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
pathway it's not going it's not a

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.190 
pathway it's not going it's not a
pathway<00:03:30.560> it's<00:03:30.890> just<00:03:31.040> I<00:03:31.450> add<00:03:32.450> a<00:03:32.510> bit<00:03:32.660> of<00:03:32.840> realism

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
pathway it's just I add a bit of realism

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:42.180 
pathway it's just I add a bit of realism
to<00:03:33.620> this

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.100 

so<00:03:43.190> with<00:03:43.490> this<00:03:43.640> we<00:03:43.880> just<00:03:43.910> spread<00:03:44.420> it<00:03:44.480> all<00:03:44.780> the

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
so with this we just spread it all the

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.170 
so with this we just spread it all the
way<00:03:45.230> around<00:03:45.380> just<00:03:46.190> to<00:03:46.310> cover<00:03:46.550> all<00:03:46.850> these

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
way around just to cover all these

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.490 
way around just to cover all these
bottom<00:03:48.050> in<00:03:48.140> the<00:03:48.230> car<00:03:48.560> place<00:03:49.840> so<00:03:50.840> people<00:03:51.080> will

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
bottom in the car place so people will

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.800 
bottom in the car place so people will
want<00:03:51.710> to<00:03:51.740> water<00:03:51.920> on<00:03:52.190> back<00:03:52.640> just<00:03:53.090> make<00:03:53.510> sure

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
want to water on back just make sure

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:00.520 
want to water on back just make sure
every<00:03:54.380> root<00:03:54.620> is<00:03:54.830> covered

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.570 

so<00:04:01.340> I<00:04:02.110> have<00:04:03.110> all<00:04:03.410> of<00:04:03.560> that<00:04:03.590> covered<00:04:04.190> now<00:04:04.520> the

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
so I have all of that covered now the

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.320 
so I have all of that covered now the
front<00:04:05.090> side<00:04:05.420> is<00:04:05.600> the<00:04:05.720> most<00:04:05.930> important<00:04:07.330> bigger

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
front side is the most important bigger

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.110 
front side is the most important bigger
the<00:04:08.540> better<00:04:08.750> more<00:04:09.200> the<00:04:10.040> more<00:04:10.310> better<00:04:10.610> effect

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
the better more the more better effect

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.790 
the better more the more better effect
in<00:04:11.390> my<00:04:11.570> opinion<00:04:12.020> anyway<00:04:12.820> so<00:04:14.020> mass<00:04:15.020> a<00:04:15.260> building

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
in my opinion anyway so mass a building

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.979 
in my opinion anyway so mass a building
placed<00:04:16.310> in<00:04:17.350> and<00:04:18.350> now<00:04:18.950> what<00:04:19.760> we<00:04:19.910> can<00:04:19.940> do<00:04:20.540> it's

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
placed in and now what we can do it's

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.910 
placed in and now what we can do it's
not<00:04:21.170> necessary<00:04:21.769> but<00:04:23.770> it's<00:04:24.770> go<00:04:25.010> back<00:04:25.870> go<00:04:26.870> to

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
not necessary but it's go back go to

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.300 
not necessary but it's go back go to
utilities<00:04:27.920> which<00:04:28.640> is<00:04:28.820> under<00:04:29.510> object<00:04:30.080> so<00:04:30.560> for

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
utilities which is under object so for

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.800 
utilities which is under object so for
