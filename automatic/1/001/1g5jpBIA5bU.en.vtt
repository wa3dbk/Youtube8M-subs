 1.4 points well what we are going to do is 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.779
 go to the page that I put the 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:25.440
 description of the mod and we download 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.540
 this file well 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.380
 at a level like we are lately and channel 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:33.890
 that I only put tutorials but in short 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.829
 I will be putting 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.050
 other things for my leaders regarding 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:42.840
 those that you are not that you are so much we go 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:47.100
 to focus on 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:50.090
 in the installation today I am here 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.780
 jump advertising we download it 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.780
 I enclose this 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.680
 you have to see a little bit here and now 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.800
 we are going here the page that I will put to you 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:06.200
 description these charges in minecraft 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.560
 there are many versions of minecraft force 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.630
 but this for the 1.4 point is the one that 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.880
 has served many others downloaded from 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.420
 which are more recent and everything but I do not 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:20.780
 has worked in order is my work 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.530
 people are what works well and 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.530
 we closed this 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.300
 we can close all this well before 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.159
 continue I want to warn that for this 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.530
 world we need to have the minecraft without 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.390
 mods since to remove the montalban 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.460
 key is so easy common to go to minecraft 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.409
 when we put this vice we give to 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.110
 strong debate and we entered well I have it 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.550
 without motorcycle and when you are going to install it 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.009
 you have to know that you do not have to have 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.690
 no way if you install it and you already have 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.920
 a way then it will not work 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.740
 in any case I always recommend you 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.380
 make a backup in case 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.290
 perhaps once I said this I say 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.479
 because many times I've been through a lot 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.710
 people complain that if it's my fault 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.190
 works 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.300
 minecraft him 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.300
 but to all these people 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.780
 I say it 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.060
 it is I just changed the main 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:19.450
 nail 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.930
 the windows of the original theme because in 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.819
 end let's go 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.469
 here we give percentage to pepe data 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:32.810
 percentage those that you have installed 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:35.060
 many many many will be fed up 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.880
 to see 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.890
 as we always do the same in the 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.890
 six new ones for you 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.049
 and so I know you go in good as 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:49.120
 there is entered point minecraft and wine 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:51.159
 It is worth now that we take the file that 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.930
 puts minecraft file chat 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:54.519
 we are going to open with our program 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.250
 decompressor some will have the winrar 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:59.920
 others the wing zip and others 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.330
 different programs more used 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.610
 we could say that it is the winrar 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.060
 but finally other programs 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.010
 file compressors also this what 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.620
 we send this we can lose it like this for 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.590
 that was asphalted in this I'm going to put 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.920
 so now we take the mental folder and the 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:22.209
 we eliminate 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:25.260
 and they are eliminated to accept now we are going 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.260
 where we have been saved 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:32.080
 file ie downloads 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.280
 It was this 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.280
 this we had here 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:43.900
 and now we open the one that says 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:47.799
 minecraft force already 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.569
 we had it here and now we take everything 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:51.610
 that we have here with control to be done 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:54.849
 ok is that I have everything selected 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:59.939
 yes that easy because we entered and what 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:59.939
 we passed it that simple 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.570
 it just happened 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.850
 it's already nine 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.240
 sack of things well now we have to 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.370
 close all 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.760
 initial brother the oldest we can not 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:20.220
 install 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:22.270
 This is what we always have to do 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.790
 I imagine it is a mistake that in the future 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.960
 will correct it promptly this is what 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.960
 we have to always do 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.100
 yes because we need the fox 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.850
 with any mode this we have to 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.850
 do as vice 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:42.569
 we have the minecraft fox and the model of 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:45.870
 that used to be used more before but as she 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:48.460
 Take the force, it's super delphi 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:52.389
 we go back again what we had here 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.919
 there was 9 closed to minecraft we become 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:57.610
 backwards as it is now they will have 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:05:00.310
 created a few folders we entered 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:03.340
 in the mods folder and here we come 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:07.479
 as you can see there is nothing but we are what 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:10.249
 in our file of loss is xl 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:12.829
 universal 3.3 

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:16.099
 this we can save for others 

00:05:12.829 --> 00:05:19.409
 many but anyway if you can not eliminate 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:22.889
 perfectly now we enter 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:28.849
 and we will check that the mode has been 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:28.849
 correctly installed in oysters 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:37.030
 much better being we are here we will see 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.400
 extremely what is all the 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:42.790
 information as we isolate could be 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:45.430
 installed there we're going to make sure 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:49.570
 that all this has been installed 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:51.370
 correctly because there may be failures 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:54.130
 how not 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:56.230
 and so let's check that everything 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:59.320
 this is correct 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:04.540
 I do not know which one my computer can ok 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:07.060
 but it says version 1.4 points 2 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:10.080
 Minecraft costs more to create worlds 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:15.050
 I do not know if they have improved it 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.050
 or what they have done but we are 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:19.690
 is that now it cost me more to load 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:23.949
 worlds how is it good this would already be a 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:26.139
 new video more would say yes and as you see 

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:28.530
 let's check effectively that 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:28.530
 we have 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:34.400
 new trees and we got here we're going to 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.400
 give us bow 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:43.009
 and effectively here you have a tree 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:45.979
 new that we do not know with everything and good 

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:48.320
 So far the tutorial has arrived 

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:51.080
 that you liked it if it's like that 

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:53.479
 so and give the live for being riding 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:55.860
 an egg and if it has served you 

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:58.860
 install 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:01.919
 this, I would appreciate it if you subscribe 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:04.860
 which always motivates me a lot because 

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:08.819
 people write 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:11.009
 nothing more to tell you what I expect from 

00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:16.159
 true that you liked it until the 

00:07:11.009 --> 00:07:16.159
 next you already know you subscribe god
