00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.529
 today I come to give some data of a 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:07.839
 research that are really 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:11.019
 impressive data that affirm 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:14.110
 the problems that consumption can bring 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:17.080
 excessive salt and that the vast majority 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:20.290
 from us we throw too much salt to the 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.720
 food and we salt food that 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:26.500
 Most of the cases already come with 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:31.060
 salt with which consumption is exceeded 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:33.940
 salt daily for about 3 or 4 times what 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.969
 effects causes this this in our 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.219
 health because quite serious effects that 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:41.769
 can lead to risk of heart attack and 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:44.530
 hypertension those who have more danger 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:47.379
 without doubts are the teenagers who 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.949
 often abuse fast foods that 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.629
 mcdonald fast and different 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:54.609
 fast food establishments and that 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:58.030
 they also abuse they abuse the 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:01:01.329
 precooked cooked and frozen 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.399
 that carry large amounts of salt like this 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.880
 like the bags of rufles potatoes 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:08.710
 doritos in short all this takes great 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.130
 from salt that can cause 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:15.189
 quite important damages and that is 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:18.130
 according to this study that according to the study 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:20.619
 that he mentioned there would be a greater risk in 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.100
 those people who consume more salt 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:26.549
 of suffering from hypertension in the future and 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:32.619
 of dying from a heart attack 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:34.539
 specifically 43% more risk the 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.270
 sodium intake the salt intake has 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:39.369
 that go down to about 1,500 milligrams 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:44.020
 while most teenagers 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:47.560
 they take about 3,800 4000 milligrams of salt 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.840
 a day with which it is not uncommon to see 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.229
 many people today dying 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.259
 of heart attacks each one is responsible for 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.509
 what he does with his body and if in the in 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.520
 early ages we have eaten 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.740
 a lot of salt 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.079
 the most normal thing is that in the future 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.979
 we have heart problems and the 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:10.209
 hypertension usually leaves sequels 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.819
 apart from that you have to follow a 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.150
 treatment and constantly have the 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:18.090
 guarded body 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.670
 at any time there may be a 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.730
 episode of strong hypertension and can 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.430
 get to die from a heart attack like that 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.310
 that it's not about foolishness trying 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.609
 stalk as little salt as possible 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.590
 foods and try to preserve the flavor 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:37.019
 original of the food because as I already 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.849
 I say most of the food that is 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.849
 they sell already come with salt
