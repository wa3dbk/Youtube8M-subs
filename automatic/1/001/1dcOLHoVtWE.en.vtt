14 million dollars this year he's a
3-point<00:00:22.619> shooter<00:00:22.980> so<00:00:23.160> when<00:00:23.279> he's<00:00:23.369> knocking

now not knocking down the three

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.320 
now not knocking down the three
he's<00:00:25.380> very<00:00:25.590> ineffective<00:00:26.160> Ben<00:00:26.760> Wallace<00:00:27.060> a

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
he's very ineffective Ben Wallace a

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.910 
he's very ineffective Ben Wallace a
rebounder<00:00:28.019> so<00:00:28.260> when<00:00:28.380> he's<00:00:28.470> not<00:00:28.619> getting

rebounds he can't really help your team
Anderson<00:00:31.230> Varejao<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:32.040> think<00:00:32.369> he's<00:00:32.489> more<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:32.759> a

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
Anderson Varejao I think he's more of a

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.580 
Anderson Varejao I think he's more of a
backup<00:00:33.270> power<00:00:33.480> forward<00:00:33.960> in<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.200> starting

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
backup power forward in the starting

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.139 
backup power forward in the starting
power<00:00:34.739> forward<00:00:34.890> he's<00:00:35.460> gonna<00:00:35.670> bring<00:00:35.880> energy

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
power forward he's gonna bring energy

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.610 
power forward he's gonna bring energy
but<00:00:36.809> not<00:00:36.960> much<00:00:37.230> else

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
but not much else

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.470 
but not much else
and<00:00:37.739> it's<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.890> Jonas<00:00:38.219> Ilgauskas<00:00:38.579> I've<00:00:39.210> made

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
and it's the Jonas Ilgauskas I've made

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.940 
and it's the Jonas Ilgauskas I've made
sure<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.750> look<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.170> see<00:00:40.320> how<00:00:40.440> old<00:00:40.680> he<00:00:40.920> was

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
sure I look to see how old he was

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.979 
sure I look to see how old he was
because<00:00:41.610> compared<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.210> White<00:00:42.390> House<00:00:42.629> I

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
because compared to the White House I

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.900 
because compared to the White House I
thought<00:00:43.290> he<00:00:43.379> was<00:00:43.530> older<00:00:43.829> than<00:00:43.950> 33<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.700> way<00:00:44.850> he

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
thought he was older than 33 the way he

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.580 
thought he was older than 33 the way he
was<00:00:45.059> moving<00:00:45.390> up<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.600> down<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.780> court<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.289> the

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
was moving up and down the court and the

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.319 
was moving up and down the court and the
last<00:00:46.829> thing<00:00:47.160> what<00:00:47.640> are<00:00:47.730> they<00:00:47.820> gonna<00:00:48.000> do<00:00:48.210> with

last thing what are they gonna do with

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.580 
last thing what are they gonna do with
their<00:00:48.480> backcourt<00:00:48.719> they<00:00:49.020> have<00:00:49.140> two<00:00:49.350> guys<00:00:49.559> that
