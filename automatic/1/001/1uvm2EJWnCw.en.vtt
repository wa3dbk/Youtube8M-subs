here to play because it's better to go

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.970 
here to play because it's better to go
somewhere<00:02:28.600> and<00:02:28.720> be<00:02:28.810> recognized<00:02:29.410> and<00:02:29.770> booed

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
and do that then have nobody recognized

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.130 
and do that then have nobody recognized
or<00:02:33.069> care<00:02:33.220> about<00:02:33.250> you<00:02:33.550> at<00:02:33.670> all<00:02:33.760> because

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
or care about you at all because

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.850 
or care about you at all because
actually<00:02:35.140> I<00:02:35.200> must<00:02:35.410> have<00:02:35.560> been<00:02:35.709> doing

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
actually I must have been doing

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.770 
actually I must have been doing
something<00:02:35.980> right<00:02:36.310> where<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.209> team<00:02:37.390> was<00:02:37.540> doing

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
something right where the team was doing

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:38.910 
something right where the team was doing
something<00:02:37.990> right<00:02:38.230> and<00:02:38.440> we<00:02:38.560> had<00:02:38.680> a<00:02:38.709> great

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
something right and we had a great

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.800 
something right and we had a great
rivalry<00:02:39.160> with<00:02:39.670> bamberg<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:40.360> bond<00:02:40.510> in<00:02:40.720> the

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
rivalry with bamberg and bond in the

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.580 
rivalry with bamberg and bond in the
past<00:02:41.250> so<00:02:42.250> I<00:02:42.640> think<00:02:43.140> this<00:02:44.140> is<00:02:44.319> always<00:02:44.500> a

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
past so I think this is always a

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.809 
past so I think this is always a
question<00:02:44.830> of

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
question of

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
guys are seeing that and sometimes you

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.920 
guys are seeing that and sometimes you
just<00:03:56.079> have<00:03:56.489> lucky<00:03:57.489> bounces<00:03:58.000> one<00:03:58.209> way<00:03:58.389> and<00:03:58.689> not

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
just have lucky bounces one way and not

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.420 
just have lucky bounces one way and not
so<00:03:59.109> lucky<00:03:59.259> bounces<00:03:59.709> the<00:03:59.829> other<00:03:59.979> way<00:04:00.159> when<00:04:00.310> it

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
so lucky bounces the other way when it

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.089 
so lucky bounces the other way when it
comes<00:04:00.639> to<00:04:00.849> some<00:04:01.540> of<00:04:01.569> the<00:04:01.720> games<00:04:01.930> we've<00:04:02.109> had<00:04:02.139> but

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
there's no excuses we like I said we put

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.280 
there's no excuses we like I said we put
ourselves<00:04:06.340> in<00:04:06.699> the<00:04:06.790> situation<00:04:07.079> now<00:04:08.079> we<00:04:08.139> have

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.199 
ourselves in the situation now we have
to<00:04:08.409> try<00:04:08.620> and<00:04:08.769> dig<00:04:09.280> ourselves<00:04:09.430> out<00:04:09.790> of<00:04:09.849> it<00:04:10.090> and

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
to try and dig ourselves out of it and

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.110 
to try and dig ourselves out of it and
yeah<00:04:11.109> we<00:04:11.650> just<00:04:11.799> have<00:04:11.949> to<00:04:12.099> deal<00:04:12.669> with<00:04:12.819> it<00:04:12.970> now<00:04:13.060> in

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
yeah we just have to deal with it now in

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.939 
yeah we just have to deal with it now in
the<00:04:13.239> last<00:04:13.419> six<00:04:13.629> weeks<00:04:13.780> and<00:04:14.079> go<00:04:14.620> on<00:04:14.739> from<00:04:14.859> there

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:14.949 
the last six weeks and go on from there

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:17.960 
the last six weeks and go on from there
we<00:04:15.879> had<00:04:16.000> a<00:04:16.030> good<00:04:16.180> performance<00:04:16.989> in<00:04:17.079> oldenburg

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
we had a good performance in oldenburg

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.759 
we had a good performance in oldenburg
and<00:04:18.970> against<00:04:19.299> Russell<00:04:19.509> to<00:04:19.690> uh<00:04:19.720> against<00:04:20.590> by

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
and against Russell to uh against by

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.060 
and against Russell to uh against by
roid<00:04:20.979> so<00:04:21.579> I<00:04:22.030> think<00:04:22.240> if<00:04:22.720> we<00:04:22.870> can<00:04:23.020> carry<00:04:23.289> and<00:04:23.860> can

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
roid so I think if we can carry and can

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.930 
roid so I think if we can carry and can
continue<00:04:24.520> this<00:04:24.669> this<00:04:25.419> fighting<00:04:25.900> and<00:04:26.940> attitude

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
continue this this fighting and attitude

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.999 
continue this this fighting and attitude
and<00:04:28.180> I<00:04:28.270> think<00:04:28.479> we'll<00:04:29.409> have<00:04:29.500> some<00:04:29.710> good<00:04:29.740> chances

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:30.009 
and I think we'll have some good chances

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:32.270 
and I think we'll have some good chances
