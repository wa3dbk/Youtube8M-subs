00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:21.860
 front 1 2 3 4 we repeat that jump for 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.610
 let them see how it is and now 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.610
 one 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:36.660
 4 5 6 7 8 we put our hands together and repeat 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.090
 this last step for them to see again 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:46.009
 How is it 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:48.560
 and we take steps to the front 3 4 5 6 and 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:52.640
 we move the hip we put one foot 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.930
 go ahead and we make this move another 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.620
 time but faster 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:02.030
 now pay attention to the hands and 16 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:05.930
 movements 7 8 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.870
 12 now slower 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:12.240
 one 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:16.910
 2 3 4 5 6 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:22.880
 7 8 12 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:25.220
 we put one foot forward and 12 another 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.140
 time for them to see how it is then we give a 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.220
 jump counting the feet move the 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:36.160
 shoulders and from side to side 1 2 3 4 this already 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.160
 it's free advance as you want, you know 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:46.860
 tun tun tun tun tun we put on 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.600
 profile and we bend the leg well 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.640
 in front of whoever doubles her so much but 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:55.370
 see how it is in the original is bent 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.790
 then we do the movements with the 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.790
 hand 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.350
 and we started looking at our hip in 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.180
 our chest 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.660
 I make the movement of my hands so that 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:13.530
 see more or less how it moves 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:18.540
 and we continue with the doll and 123 and go down 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.540
 45 now from side to side 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.439
 we're almost done like this 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.299
 we started this other step see that a 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:30.380
 hand is the one that goes forward and another 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.270
 hand is the one that gives that field 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.310
 practice many steps because to me 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.310
 I was also very confused at the beginning 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.440
 two 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.310
 4 and see how the feet slide 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.200
 after that nothing else is again 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:51.080
 movement with the hand 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.390
 and again pay attention there I'm going to 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:04:00.510
 zoom in so you can see it well 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:03.890
 you will see we paint our hands 3 4 5 6 and 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.930
 we move the hip again 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.550
 we're almost done now we put together the 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.250
 arms we recharged our weight in a 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.290
 We were already the other leg and there you see 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:20.380
 how does the position of the arms change in 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:22.810
 two steps on each side 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.080
 then we see the deadlines from one side to another 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:29.050
 we slide and again it repeats 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.520
 same girls do not feel that not that 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.130
 explains the tutorials well but good 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.290
 I try to keep more what they see in the 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:39.270
 video that my voice so repeat the 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.270
 times they want and then we finish 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.670
 help sabina soy prima mariana ruiz a
