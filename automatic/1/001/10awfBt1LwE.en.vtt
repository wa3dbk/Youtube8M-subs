00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:06.540
 only just nine months has since 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.780
 last formula 1 game f1 2014 lasted 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.549
 there already appears f1 2015 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.709
 this should be less of a gap filler 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:14.610
 Feel more like a complete one 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:16.710
 new game 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.690
 To succeed , sets codemasters 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.340
 among other things on a new engine and 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.380
 several detail improvements 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:28.830
 if that continues the series again 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:31.470
 brings forward, we now reveal the 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.030
 chic simple main menu from f1 2015 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.250
 Uses the different 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.080
 racing modes in addition to a championship 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.850
 are also the new season mode 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.800
 to retrace the time trial 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.930
 compulsory multiplayer mode or 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.590
 an option for personal preference 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.600
 for optional 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.250
 a career mode in which we are still in the 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.410
 last year a driver to the 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.660
 Formula 1 allowed ran peak is missing in 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.570
 the 2015 acquisition, however, completely 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.070
 just like a basketball championship 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.960
 normal championship relieve this 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.210
 loss is a bit, but still 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.950
 only standard food we determine before 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.019
 season whether the short normal or 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.909
 want to drive complete race weekends 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.539
 There should be something for everyone 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.609
 his 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:10.499
 Nevertheless, it remains incomprehensible why one 

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:11.789
 Do not make any fine adjustments and yourself 

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:14.100
 the race long after own gusto 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:16.049
 can put together a complete 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.289
 qualifying is actually only at 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.119
 the complete race distance possible thanks 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:22.889
 The complete F1 license is again 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.679
 All driver teams and track as well 

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:27.869
 on board, for example, the parc fermÃ© 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:29.939
 regulations his return to the 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.010
 formula 1 circus celebrates after 23 years 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.570
 the great price of mexico 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.070
 the track is a great addition and 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.790
 is one of the fastest slopes 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.790
 at all 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.909
 in nice addition is also the 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.800
 Integration of the 2014 season 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.630
 So who is vettel again with sebastian 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.830
 want to start in the red bull 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.950
 do that here 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.990
 on the track itself is f1 2015 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.850
 pretty strong that is mainly due to 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.680
 overworked ride and the right one 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.180
 Precise control with both 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.770
 controller as well as the steering wheel 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.210
 We control the bolides well 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.250
 the body feels in comparison 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.820
 to the last part a bit heavier 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.989
 that makes it a little less active 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.530
 There are problems at first only with the 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.569
 curve output 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.800
 there can be too much gas in the back already 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.750
 break out easily 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.580
 the handling is definitely a step 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.780
 in the right direction if not 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.780
 real revolution 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.459
 that the races are mostly correct 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.049
 is exciting but also s.der 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.510
 good if usually a little too 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:37.129
 aggressive ki being the though 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.989
 usually only in the course of a race 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.190
 The first thing that really stands out is that they thunder 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.349
 opponents mostly like pulling the strings 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.629
 through the curves act something 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.610
 robotic in the later course if that 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:48.200
 field more shreds shows the k but 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.700
 your strengths block overtaking maneuvers 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.860
 clever or pull out of the 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.330
 wind shadow past us is beautiful 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.579
 also that the opponents sometimes the 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.840
 one or two burners or horseback riding 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:58.840
 to afford the pebble bed 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.840
 and where we already at the beautiful things 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.490
 are also the improved interaction 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.120
 I like annika team 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.890
 pretty good 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.210
 that's why it's still running 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.680
 better tips for strategies 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.030
 during a race there are under 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.130
 other updates to our current 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.510
 tire status or gasoline filling 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.100
 on request we can in the 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.390
 console versions even voice commands 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.700
 give if we have a specific one 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.020
 want to have information on the pc 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.980
 this function hopefully still 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.200
 submitted 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.880
 by the given quantity of gasoline and in the 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.320
 reasonably realistic 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.270
 Consumption also comes a nice 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.959
 tactical note in the game it always too 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.959
 note applies 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:42.330
 By contrast, the criminal system is pretty much falling 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.950
 grow out of the entire caution 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.500
 and flag concept is indeed in the game 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.110
 However, plenty of half-baked one 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.250
 safety-car is even completely missing 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.530
 For example, we can provide a few positions 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.240
 bend curves with impunity while das 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.980
 that happened several times during the test 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.570
 we fierce from a computer driver 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.180
 but were rammed even the 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.980
 time penalty got that can then straight in 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.260
 the full race distances to 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.239
 cause frustration attacks 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.040
 depending on how high 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.170
 who is at one is completely after 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.950
 do you have a lot of driving aids to or 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.140
 switch off 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.790
 the learning curve is quite pleasant but 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.380
 we can only recommend for 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.479
 quiet the first test championships 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.350
 sometimes stability control or abs too 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.690
 deactivate 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.430
 that makes the whole trickier the 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.889
 joy after a good placement is 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.689
 but much higher 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:29.520
 For all Cologne codemasters has the 

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:31.379
 professional season mode integrated 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.419
 He forces us over the full race distance 

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:35.699
 the cockpit perspective is fixed 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.770
 Turn off all driving aids and ads 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:40.469
 and the manual circuit a 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.270
 even if f1 2015 no complete 

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:44.009
 simulation is here but on 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.740
 I feel like playing one 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:48.360
 Overall, that is a good addition to whether 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.729
 But it has its own mode 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.080
 We would have needed, especially since we needed 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:55.639
 all settings even with the normal 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.639
 championship 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:02.599
 f1 2015 runs on a new engine 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.860
 more precisely on the ego engine 4.0 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:06.120
 and yes in comparison to last year 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.610
 makes the optics already a decent 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.150
 jump without us but from the stool to 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.099
 tear 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.689
 especially the vehicle models and the 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:14.340
 Detailed routes are well done 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:16.199
 also effects such as weather changes 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.000
 sparking when putting undercut 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:19.740
 or the heat flickering behind the 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.479
 Boliden as well as the constant worry 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.210
 Frame rate of 60 pictures in seconds 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:26.639
 for a good if somewhat sterile 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.949
 visual impression as well was 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:30.689
 finally honing their presentation 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:32.159
 Before a race we see for example 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:33.779
 short scenes from the boxes 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:35.669
 There's also one after a race 

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:37.589
 award ceremony that ensures much more 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:39.629
 atmosphere than last year 

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:40.949
 Welcome the more about the qualifying 

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:43.159
 for the big price of australia 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:45.180
 should go any moment 

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:46.830
 Soon we will experience that 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.279
 Boliden really on the track 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.639
 can 

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:51.750
 what awaits us in the upcoming qualifying 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:54.300
 The same applies to the commentator 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.770
 duo heiko water and stefan rÃ¶mer sees 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.360
 Although before a race a decent 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.669
 make an introduction and the current 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.699
 happen well but pick something up 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:04.740
 unmotivated and listless act the 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:06.330
 engine noise also fell as in f1 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.279
 2014 something the power 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:11.039
 codemasters should be here next time 

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:12.719
 Part necessarily correct neat 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:15.180
 has already improved codemasters at 

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:17.069
 the pc version was the start 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.629
 plagued by a number of bugs it was under 

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:21.139
 other problems with the storage of 

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:22.949
 set ups as well as complete crashes 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:27.289
 Meanwhile, the biggest problems are 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:27.289
 but fixed thanks to a larger patch 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:34.450
 f1 2015 has become a good race game 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.280
 On the route you have thanks good ki 

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.720
 many options and the ordinary 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.400
 driving a lot of fun 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.020
 the races are exciting and thanks to the 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.180
 official license and the improved 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:46.300
 presentation also agrees the atmosphere 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:48.520
 Nevertheless, as with f1 2014 remains 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.169
 schaler taste especially because of 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.600
 Errors in the criminal system and the 

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:54.940
 small extent why there is to 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.750
 for example, no career mode where is that 

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.310
 safety car 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:59.650
 why was the split screen mode 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:01.540
 deleted only a few examples for 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:03.310
 Things are a good game with the 

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:05.710
 new engine again clearly 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:08.020
 can upgrade like a completely new 

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:10.600
 game feels like 1 2015 because of that 

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:14.220
 not rather as a solid basis for 

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.220
 come the f1 parts
