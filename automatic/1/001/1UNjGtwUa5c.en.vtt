 the marisa fidelis 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.059
 I'm 23 years old and my beauty blog 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.550
 Inside I started it two years ago 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.949
 ago when I realized like 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.960
 makeup I found it cool to tell who 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.740
 do not know so much and even more mills 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.970
 have my skin tone 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.529
 in the previous month people can 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.560
 Finding Pretty Thing About Makeup 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.020
 the main focus is makeup I give 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.309
 some tips products I make reviews 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.750
 about some shade lipstick releases and 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.969
 sometimes takes the choir away from 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.770
 Makeup teaches girls how to 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.649
 make up things leggy and that people 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.930
 You can use it every day, I like it 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.760
 I started to like makeup when I 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.640
 I saw my mother if she was a maid she likes 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.350
 a lot of makeup is very vain then 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.390
 She was kind of my reference to me. 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.800
 example so every time she 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.809
 makeup asked for the word and makeup 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.489
 also put her lipstick on the 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.890
 Her stuff so that 's what I 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.540
 I wanted my love for makeup and now 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.460

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.280

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.900

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.650

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.869
 Dark I'm going to use a shadow brush 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.270
 and volume of square seal will become more 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.840

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.759
 high flicker 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:51.960

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.680

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.780

00:01:52.680 --> 00:02:01.830

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:03.330

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.430

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.250
 Now we'll snack on it. 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.210
 a patient will accuse the color that does not have 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.370
 brightness 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.620

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:19.100
 lipsticks to match this makeup 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.100

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.870
 this option of girls who do not like 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.680
 very use and prefer to use the eye 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:31.020
 marked and a more muted mouth 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.030
