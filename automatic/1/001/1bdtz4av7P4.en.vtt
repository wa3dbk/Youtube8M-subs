00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
tuning today we're going to show you how

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.859 
tuning today we're going to show you how
to<00:00:15.559> replace<00:00:15.860> the<00:00:16.130> insert<00:00:16.490> or<00:00:16.850> damper<00:00:17.330> and<00:00:17.600> your

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
to replace the insert or damper and your

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.080 
to replace the insert or damper and your
coil<00:00:18.050> over<00:00:18.350> again<00:00:18.590> at<00:00:19.310> the<00:00:19.400> end<00:00:19.490> side<00:00:19.730> of<00:00:19.820> FK

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
coil over again at the end side of FK

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.660 
coil over again at the end side of FK
coil<00:00:20.450> overs<00:00:20.750> and<00:00:21.170> you<00:00:21.529> notice<00:00:21.800> that<00:00:21.830> the<00:00:22.189> coil

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
coil overs and you notice that the coil

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.810 
coil overs and you notice that the coil
over<00:00:22.850> itself<00:00:23.420> may<00:00:23.810> be<00:00:23.869> leaking<00:00:24.140> some<00:00:24.470> oil

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820 
over itself may be leaking some oil

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.339 
over itself may be leaking some oil
there's<00:00:25.820> no<00:00:25.970> need<00:00:26.150> to<00:00:26.180> rebuild<00:00:26.599> these<00:00:26.869> you<00:00:27.230> can

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
there's no need to rebuild these you can

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:28.929 
there's no need to rebuild these you can
actually<00:00:27.680> just<00:00:27.829> buy<00:00:27.980> a<00:00:28.009> new<00:00:28.040> insert<00:00:28.640> which

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
actually just buy a new insert which

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.390 
actually just buy a new insert which
looks<00:00:29.150> just<00:00:29.329> like<00:00:29.509> this<00:00:29.840> and<00:00:30.250> replace<00:00:31.250> it

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:31.400 
looks just like this and replace it

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.860 
looks just like this and replace it

yourself and today I'm going to show you
how<00:00:33.020> easy<00:00:33.320> that<00:00:33.440> is<00:00:33.670> so<00:00:35.020> first<00:00:36.020> off<00:00:36.230> you're

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
how easy that is so first off you're

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.140 
how easy that is so first off you're
going<00:00:36.470> to<00:00:36.530> take<00:00:36.590> the<00:00:36.800> coil<00:00:37.010> over<00:00:37.160> kit<00:00:37.310> off<00:00:37.850> your

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.150 
going to take the coil over kit off your

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.790 
going to take the coil over kit off your
bar<00:00:38.360> for<00:00:39.079> the<00:00:39.140> coil<00:00:39.320> over<00:00:39.620> that's<00:00:39.770> leaking

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
bar for the coil over that's leaking

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:53.860 
bar for the coil over that's leaking
disassemble<00:00:42.800> it

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.150 

okay<00:00:54.870> now<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.290> you're<00:00:55.560> down<00:00:55.650> to<00:00:55.830> this<00:00:55.920> point

okay now that you're down to this point
you're<00:00:56.340> going<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.520> see<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.790> there's<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.060> cap

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
you're going to see that there's a cap

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.060 
you're going to see that there's a cap
here<00:00:57.630> this<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.170> what<00:00:58.320> actually<00:00:58.680> holds<00:00:59.010> a

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
here this is what actually holds a

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.740 
here this is what actually holds a
damper<00:00:59.490> or<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.760> insert<00:01:00.090> inside<00:01:00.450> the<00:01:00.570> coil

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
damper or the insert inside the coil

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.900 
damper or the insert inside the coil
oversleep<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:02.100> let's<00:01:02.220> see<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.520> do<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.790> get

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
oversleep so let's see the do to get

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.900 
oversleep so let's see the do to get
this<00:01:03.030> cap<00:01:03.270> up<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.840> need<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.020> pin<00:01:04.290> rent<00:01:04.700> pinch<00:01:05.700> it

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:05.910 
this cap up you need a pin rent pinch it

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.150 
this cap up you need a pin rent pinch it
has<00:01:06.060> two<00:01:06.330> little<00:01:06.630> pins<00:01:06.840> on<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.200> up<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.650> toss<00:01:07.860> you

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.160 
has two little pins on it up to toss you

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.740 
has two little pins on it up to toss you
can<00:01:08.310> see<00:01:08.490> there's<00:01:08.700> two<00:01:08.850> holes<00:01:09.210> right<00:01:09.390> here<00:01:09.660> on

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
can see there's two holes right here on

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.400 
can see there's two holes right here on
the<00:01:09.840> cap<00:01:10.050> which<00:01:10.830> easily<00:01:11.870> goes<00:01:12.870> in<00:01:13.050> just<00:01:13.260> like

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410 
the cap which easily goes in just like

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.550 
the cap which easily goes in just like
that<00:01:13.470> give<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.310> few<00:01:14.430> twists<00:01:14.790> around<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.600> it

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
that give it a few twists around and it

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.890 
that give it a few twists around and it
should<00:01:16.800> a<00:01:16.830> hawk<00:01:17.160> so<00:01:17.520> once<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.450> got<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.690> cap

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
should a hawk so once you got the cap

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.290 
should a hawk so once you got the cap
off<00:01:19.200> do<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.130> pull<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.490> old<00:01:20.670> insert<00:01:21.150> that's

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
off do you pull the old insert that's

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.760 
off do you pull the old insert that's
leaking<00:01:21.750> out<00:01:23.630> now<00:01:24.630> before<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.140> put<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.440> new

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
leaking out now before you put the new

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.990 
leaking out now before you put the new
insert<00:01:26.310> in<00:01:26.990> when<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.050> get<00:01:28.200> your<00:01:28.350> FK<00:01:29.000> insert
