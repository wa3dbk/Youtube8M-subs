00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
all right on this I model first thing to

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.889 
all right on this I model first thing to
know<00:00:04.920> there's<00:00:05.700> a<00:00:05.759> covering<00:00:06.150> on<00:00:06.240> the<00:00:06.270> eye<00:00:06.390> and

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
know there's a covering on the eye and

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.440 
know there's a covering on the eye and
located<00:00:07.680> right<00:00:07.799> up<00:00:07.950> here<00:00:08.120> within<00:00:09.120> this

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
located right up here within this

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.350 
located right up here within this
covering<00:00:10.050> is<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:11.250> lacrimal<00:00:11.730> gland<00:00:12.000> it's<00:00:12.300> a

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
covering is the lacrimal gland it's a

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.240 
covering is the lacrimal gland it's a
very<00:00:12.570> glandular<00:00:13.530> constructure

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
very glandular constructure

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.609 
very glandular constructure
that<00:00:15.150> produces<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.719> tears<00:00:16.049> they<00:00:16.289> go<00:00:16.410> across

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
that produces the tears they go across

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.070 
that produces the tears they go across
the<00:00:16.949> eye<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.550> exit<00:00:18.359> through<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.630> lockable

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
the eye and exit through the lockable

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.429 
the eye and exit through the lockable
bone<00:00:19.260> in<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.529> other<00:00:19.650> corner<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.220> eye<00:00:21.439> so

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
bone in the other corner of the eye so

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.840 
bone in the other corner of the eye so
important<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:23.010> know<00:00:23.189> about<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.670> lack<00:00:23.820> of

important to know about the lack of
mobile<00:00:24.210> I'm<00:00:25.279> sorry<00:00:26.279> laughs<00:00:26.640> no<00:00:26.820> but<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.029> eye

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
mobile I'm sorry laughs no but the eye

mobile I'm sorry laughs no but the eye
is<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.230> optic<00:00:28.680> nerve<00:00:29.449> looking<00:00:30.449> there<00:00:30.599> the

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
is the optic nerve looking there the

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.749 
is the optic nerve looking there the
optic<00:00:31.199> nerve<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.380> rather<00:00:31.710> simple<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.340> see

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
optic nerve is rather simple to see

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.150 
optic nerve is rather simple to see
especially<00:00:32.969> in<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.360> model<00:00:33.660> like<00:00:33.780> this<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.980> see

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
especially in a model like this you see

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.530 
especially in a model like this you see
the<00:00:35.280> optic<00:00:35.489> nerve<00:00:35.640> coming<00:00:35.969> out<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.360> back

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
the optic nerve coming out of the back

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.340 
the optic nerve coming out of the back
of<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.840> eye<00:00:38.570> however<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.629> also<00:00:39.809> have<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.110> see

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
of the eye however you also have to see

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.190 
of the eye however you also have to see
is<00:00:40.590> back<00:00:41.370> here<00:00:41.760> when<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.940> optic<00:00:42.780> nerve<00:00:42.930> comes

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
is back here when the optic nerve comes

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.760 
is back here when the optic nerve comes
out<00:00:43.550> you<00:00:44.550> see<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:44.940> Y<00:00:45.360> shape<00:00:45.719> this<00:00:46.410> actually

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
out you see this Y shape this actually

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.500 
out you see this Y shape this actually
connects<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.190> another<00:00:47.340> eye<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:48.300> other<00:00:48.329> eye

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
connects to another eye the other eye

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.049 
connects to another eye the other eye
over<00:00:48.930> here<00:00:49.079> on<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.230> other<00:00:49.320> side<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:50.059> this

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
over here on the other side and this

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.990 
over here on the other side and this
point<00:00:51.420> right<00:00:51.539> here<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:52.500> called<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.489> optic

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
point right here is called the optic

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.040 
point right here is called the optic
chiasm<00:00:54.660> where<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.320> two<00:00:55.590> optic<00:00:56.070> pictures<00:00:56.460> meet

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
chiasm where the two optic pictures meet

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.229 
chiasm where the two optic pictures meet
and<00:00:58.250> then<00:00:59.539> f<00:01:00.539> as<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.289> eye<00:01:01.590> as<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.760> nerve<00:01:02.969> goes

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
and then f as the eye as the nerve goes

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.570 
and then f as the eye as the nerve goes
off<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:03.809> way<00:01:04.049> towards<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.589> brain<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:05.129> is

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
off this way towards the brain it is

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:14.359 
off this way towards the brain it is
known<00:01:05.729> as<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.939> optic<00:01:06.479> tract<00:01:13.040> if<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.100> look<00:01:14.250> at

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
known as the optic tract if you look at

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.450 
known as the optic tract if you look at
least<00:01:14.549> two<00:01:14.760> large<00:01:15.560> large<00:01:16.560> but<00:01:16.860> relatively

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
least two large large but relatively

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.609 
least two large large but relatively
large<00:01:17.670> structures<00:01:18.450> here<00:01:18.810> these<00:01:19.350> are<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.560> two

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
large structures here these are the two

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.179 
large structures here these are the two
optic<00:01:20.189> nerves<00:01:20.430> coming<00:01:20.850> in<00:01:21.060> towards<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.450> brain

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
optic nerves coming in towards the brain

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.940 
optic nerves coming in towards the brain
right<00:01:23.189> in<00:01:23.400> this<00:01:23.610> area<00:01:24.380> they<00:01:25.380> merged<00:01:25.710> together

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
right in this area they merged together

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.060 
right in this area they merged together
this<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:26.759> your<00:01:26.880> optic<00:01:27.360> chiasm<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:30.409> then<00:01:31.409> as

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
this is your optic chiasm and then as

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.130 
this is your optic chiasm and then as
you<00:01:32.250> follow<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.610> after<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.630> leaves<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.900> optic

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
you follow the after it leaves the optic

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.080 
you follow the after it leaves the optic
chiasm<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.650> can<00:01:34.770> actually<00:01:35.009> follow<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.729> optic

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
chiasm you can actually follow the optic

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.499 
chiasm you can actually follow the optic
tract<00:01:36.439> all<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.710> way<00:01:37.829> around<00:01:38.250> as<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:39.090> goes<00:01:39.240> into

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
tract all the way around as it goes into

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.929 
tract all the way around as it goes into
the<00:01:39.810> midbrain<00:01:40.460> this<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.549> your<00:01:41.670> optic<00:01:42.030> nerve

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
the midbrain this is your optic nerve

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
all right some things you have to know

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:07.109 
all right some things you have to know
about<00:01:57.380> the<00:01:57.799> I<00:02:00.280> rebuild<00:02:01.280> this<00:02:01.429> thing<00:02:01.610> here<00:02:05.289> okay

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
about the I rebuild this thing here okay

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.600 
about the I rebuild this thing here okay
for<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.360> superior<00:02:09.019> oblique<00:02:09.049> muscle<00:02:09.349> you<00:02:10.340> see

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
for the superior oblique muscle you see

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.140 
for the superior oblique muscle you see
it<00:02:10.700> here<00:02:11.000> you<00:02:11.980> notice<00:02:12.980> that<00:02:13.160> it<00:02:13.430> comes<00:02:13.640> off<00:02:13.910> and

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
it here you notice that it comes off and

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:20.050 
it here you notice that it comes off and
then<00:02:14.750> it<00:02:15.019> cuts<00:02:15.290> across<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.739> top<00:02:16.280> of<00:02:16.459> the<00:02:16.580> eye

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.270 

well<00:02:20.660> muscles<00:02:21.319> don't<00:02:21.440> normally<00:02:21.799> want<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.069> just

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
well muscles don't normally want to just

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.949 
well muscles don't normally want to just
change<00:02:22.549> directions<00:02:23.060> rapidly<00:02:23.750> without

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
change directions rapidly without

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.199 
change directions rapidly without
anything<00:02:24.500> holding<00:02:24.680> them<00:02:24.980> therefore<00:02:25.819> if<00:02:26.090> you

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
anything holding them therefore if you

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.600 
anything holding them therefore if you
look<00:02:26.329> right<00:02:26.599> in<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:26.750> corner<00:02:27.140> here<00:02:27.489> you<00:02:28.489> can

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
look right in the corner here you can

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:29.680 
look right in the corner here you can
see<00:02:28.700> actually<00:02:28.790> see<00:02:29.150> there's<00:02:29.420> a<00:02:29.480> little

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
see actually see there's a little

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.440 
see actually see there's a little
membrane<00:02:30.170> right<00:02:30.799> in<00:02:30.950> the<00:02:31.040> corner<00:02:31.400> that<00:02:31.819> holds

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
membrane right in the corner that holds

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.259 
membrane right in the corner that holds
a<00:02:32.540> superior<00:02:33.230> oblique<00:02:33.500> in<00:02:34.010> this<00:02:34.160> place<00:02:34.430> this<00:02:35.090> is

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
a superior oblique in this place this is

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.170 
a superior oblique in this place this is
known<00:02:35.480> as<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.780> trochlea<00:02:36.519> it's<00:02:37.519> just<00:02:37.700> a<00:02:37.790> little

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
known as the trochlea it's just a little

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.160 
known as the trochlea it's just a little
hoop<00:02:39.079> that<00:02:39.799> holds<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:41.209> superior<00:02:41.720> oblique<00:02:41.780> in
