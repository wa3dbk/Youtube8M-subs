00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
blush I tried it just because I have it

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.250 
blush I tried it just because I have it
it<00:05:30.620> is<00:05:30.890> so<00:05:31.190> pigmented<00:05:31.940> and<00:05:32.360> usually<00:05:32.720> that's<00:05:32.990> a

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
it is so pigmented and usually that's a

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.140 
it is so pigmented and usually that's a
really<00:05:33.560> good<00:05:33.710> thing<00:05:33.980> but<00:05:34.160> for<00:05:34.400> a<00:05:34.460> blush<00:05:34.760> it's

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
really good thing but for a blush it's

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.420 
really good thing but for a blush it's
so<00:05:35.360> pigmented<00:05:35.840> it<00:05:36.170> actually<00:05:36.560> works<00:05:36.950> against

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
so pigmented it actually works against

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.400 
so pigmented it actually works against
it<00:05:37.550> it's<00:05:37.790> hard<00:05:38.480> to<00:05:38.630> work<00:05:38.810> with<00:05:38.990> because<00:05:39.140> it

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
it it's hard to work with because it

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:40.900
