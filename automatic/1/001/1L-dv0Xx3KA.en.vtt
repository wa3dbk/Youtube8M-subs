just the base only and you'd use those
as<00:03:45.060> a<00:03:45.090> maybe<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.810> kids<00:03:45.959> get<00:03:46.109> older<00:03:46.139> but<00:03:46.500> we'd

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
as a maybe the kids get older but we'd

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:47.809 
as a maybe the kids get older but we'd
always<00:03:46.799> recommend<00:03:46.919> you<00:03:47.519> know<00:03:47.579> you're<00:03:47.699> the

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
always recommend you know you're the

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.610 
always recommend you know you're the
safest<00:03:48.449> position<00:03:48.569> is<00:03:48.930> have<00:03:49.109> a<00:03:49.139> high-back

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
safest position is have a high-back

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.920 
safest position is have a high-back
booster<00:03:49.859> that<00:03:50.370> does<00:03:50.760> making<00:03:51.030> sure<00:03:51.329> in<00:03:51.540> that

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
booster that does making sure in that

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.210 
booster that does making sure in that
case<00:03:52.169> there's<00:03:52.379> nothing<00:03:52.530> making<00:03:52.919> sure<00:03:53.069> the

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
case there's nothing making sure the

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.069 
case there's nothing making sure the
seat<00:03:53.459> belt<00:03:53.639> is<00:03:53.760> coming<00:03:54.060> across<00:03:54.180> correctly<00:03:54.870> so

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
seat belt is coming across correctly so

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.259 
seat belt is coming across correctly so
you'd<00:03:55.620> have<00:03:55.650> to<00:03:55.829> do<00:03:56.370> that<00:03:56.549> check<00:03:56.760> in<00:03:56.910> this<00:03:57.000> case

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
you'd have to do that check in this case

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:58.909 
you'd have to do that check in this case
we've<00:03:57.690> got<00:03:57.720> adjusters<00:03:58.379> and<00:03:58.410> make<00:03:58.620> sure<00:03:58.769> that

00:03:58.909 --> 00:03:58.919
