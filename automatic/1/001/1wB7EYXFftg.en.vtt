00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:12.990
 wow pow pow on the other hand excuse me but 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:14.790
 I know that given the jaws of the thing you 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.580
 are you going to tell me to do the wrong thing mach a 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.350
 bazaar but the purpose of the thing was to 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.240
 do something that looked like 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.439
 the eternal reward by thinking that 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.180
 the army had to be good for the young 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.410
 player to lower than that weapons in 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.720
 foam that will serap people tap that's the 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.010
 more or less successful challenge except that I do not 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.590
 will not use it to hit on 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:37.110
 someone no the moose crumbles of 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.430
 everywhere they break macha bazaar 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.070
 at jallet you stick them to several 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.720
 even right no I will not use for 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.150
 to hit someone other than myself 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.620
 but it sounds like the one that's worth to me 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.820
 I'm stupid so I hit myself 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.089
 that's it, and I know that 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.089
 pleases 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.100
 as usual I leave a picture 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.750
 found on the internet before launching me 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.920
 in the manufacture of the paper pattern 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.570
 for the blade 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.070
 I needed three pieces of foam 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.320
 cut with a scalpel that I should 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.980
 bunk and stick with glue 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.930
 neoprene 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.520
 you have to make a cut in the room 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.000
 from the middle to the carbon rod to 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.160
 interior 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.229
 note that I left a good length 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.060
 of carbon exceed that will be the part 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.280
 in the world it remains only 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.300
 paste everything with neoprene glue 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.830
 apply it on both surfaces 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.560
 wait 15 minutes then assemble the 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:28.540
 since it's a more contact glue 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.540
 you better tap that will hold 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.460
 after painting the blade of several 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.140
 layers of latex that's the result 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.140
 it only remains to paint the grounds 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.870
 for the guard I just and cut the 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.760
 forms in a DVD box to 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.370
 scissors since them and painted black 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.500
 before several layers of walleye for the 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.220
 I just took a handle 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.970
 broom I have bed but fucking 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.170
 now that the video is 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.150
 completed I will be able to tackle 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.750
 something else and I think you know 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.370
 already what I am going to tackle 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.480
 yes but good this one already you've seen 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.650
 the time it took me to do the 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.120
 ternary compensates for the eternal 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.570
 reward is a small weapon to say 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:46.420
 not that it's u2 a weapon and sleep at 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.920
 close but hey it's just that I am 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.410
 really pretend that I'm everything 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.570
 only to do this kind of stuff 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.840
 So here is the minigun of heavy I 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.900
 asked if it was not better than 15 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.110
 micro shit so I was thinking of 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:05.590
 do or facebook page with weapons 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:08.140
 that I made photo bazaar with 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.120
 links to the course course where I 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.730
 would put the advancement of weapons underway 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.820
 So like that you see where do 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.820
 I am and it could be more 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:21.280
 allow to discuss with me big I 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.380
 am co because instead of you 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.800
 to wait while I do not know me 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.330
 two three four five months maybe and 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.270
 without seeing the progress of the handover so 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.350
 I see that it's disturbing even me 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.200
 see that the arm is not moving forward 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.910
 la rochelle 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.680
 I work there on mende when 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.390
 tomorrow I would like to know your reactions 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.440
 precisely because of that because I 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.030
 thought it was not bad 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.610
 idea personally finally good I'm going 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.260
 not stay on it and the comments 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.550
 are there tomorrow will be so this is this 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.680
 video is finally over I'm going to be able 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.800
 to go to the thing that is behind me 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.230
 could always see the wpt above 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.569
 above me I would fart on me a 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.069
 little link on the wp to show you 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:08.040
 how to do it so the thing is it 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:09.180
 summarize to charles that's how I've been to 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.340
 the billion is not long ago 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.860
 so it was in March to mid March yes I 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.450
 speak that ben jawad 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.729
 I made some purchases that I 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:22.109
 loved the first thing I have 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:23.790
 bought ben it was this I saw that I 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.070
 done to I must take it so 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.479
 I lend directly so do not ask me 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.790
 not to do the good Belgian Catholic where 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:32.250
 I have one I would put you maybe 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:38.479
 the link to the site that sells this genre 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:40.590
 of stuff and I bought I bought this 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:43.169
 so this thing does not ask us to 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.849
 do it either I will not get there 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.889
 will absolutely not arrive 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:50.050
 I'm sure you've seen that before 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:52.899
 also strings that's all for 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.369
 the moment bomb by then I'm not telling you
