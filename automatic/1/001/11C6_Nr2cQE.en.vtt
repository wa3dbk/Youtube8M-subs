everything when he left that round
instead<00:04:51.800> he<00:04:52.220> lost<00:04:52.460> points<00:04:52.729> and<00:04:53.120> he<00:04:53.780> lost<00:04:54.139> some

instead he lost points and he lost some
momentum<00:04:54.740> and<00:04:54.889> lost<00:04:55.070> a<00:04:55.190> little<00:04:55.310> bit<00:04:55.490> of

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
momentum and lost a little bit of

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.820 
momentum and lost a little bit of
confidence<00:04:56.030> so<00:04:56.270> the<00:04:56.419> question<00:04:56.810> was<00:04:56.960> how<00:04:57.199> is<00:04:57.650> he

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
confidence so the question was how is he

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.350 
confidence so the question was how is he
gonna<00:04:57.919> rebound<00:04:58.370> will<00:04:58.580> he<00:04:58.729> be<00:04:58.849> able<00:04:58.940> to<00:04:59.150> dig

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
gonna rebound will he be able to dig

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:06.840 
gonna rebound will he be able to dig
himself<00:04:59.599> out<00:04:59.990> of<00:05:00.050> that<00:05:00.490> hole<00:05:01.490> that<00:05:01.729> he's<00:05:01.849> in
