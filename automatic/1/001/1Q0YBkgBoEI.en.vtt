chemistry and it's apparently technology
in<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.320> mix<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.830> beautiful<00:01:14.280> combined

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729

well<00:01:16.830> hey<00:01:17.100> what<00:01:17.700> did<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:17.880> got<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.210> what<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.689> does

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
well hey what did I got it what it does

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.109 
well hey what did I got it what it does
is<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.140> stops<00:01:19.590> vibrating<00:01:19.920> stuff<00:01:20.610> from<00:01:20.820> making

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
is it stops vibrating stuff from making

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.080 
is it stops vibrating stuff from making
noise<00:01:21.330> yeah<00:01:22.009> and<00:01:23.009> that's<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.340> really<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.820> stops

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
noise yeah and that's it really it stops

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.899 
noise yeah and that's it really it stops
vibrating<00:01:24.330> stuff<00:01:24.840> for<00:01:24.990> making<00:01:25.290> noise<00:01:25.320> and

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
vibrating stuff for making noise and

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:27.770 
vibrating stuff for making noise and
talking<00:01:26.909> about<00:01:26.939> breaking<00:01:27.390> things<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.689> make

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
talking about breaking things that make

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.630 
talking about breaking things that make
noise<00:01:27.900> you've<00:01:28.140> gotta<00:01:28.320> do<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.710> like<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.250> by

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
noise you've gotta do it like is by

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.300 
noise you've gotta do it like is by
example<00:01:30.000> if<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.450> take<00:01:30.479> two<00:01:30.900> zeros<00:01:31.350> here<00:01:31.650> when

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
example if you take two zeros here when

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.960 
example if you take two zeros here when
I<00:01:32.340> hit<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.850> symbol<00:01:33.329> for<00:01:34.140> 14-inch<00:01:34.799> crash<00:01:35.130> 101

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
I hit this symbol for 14-inch crash 101

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.300 
I hit this symbol for 14-inch crash 101
brunoise<00:01:36.390> from<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.960> single<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.590> basically

motive<00:04:39.229> environment<00:04:39.860> the<00:04:39.949> last<00:04:40.160> thing<00:04:40.370> you

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
motive environment the last thing you

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.100 
motive environment the last thing you
want<00:04:40.669> is<00:04:40.789> something<00:04:40.970> that<00:04:41.240> involved<00:04:41.600> absorb

water<00:04:42.289> and<00:04:42.830> this<00:04:43.340> basically<00:04:43.699> goes<00:04:44.630> on<00:04:44.840> top<00:04:45.110> of

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
water and this basically goes on top of

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.439 
water and this basically goes on top of
the<00:04:45.650> extreme<00:04:46.190> product<00:04:46.699> then<00:04:47.060> we<00:04:47.150> stick<00:04:47.419> this

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:47.449 
the extreme product then we stick this

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:49.650 
the extreme product then we stick this
on<00:04:47.780> top<00:04:48.050> and<00:04:48.530> when<00:04:48.680> your<00:04:48.770> couple<00:04:49.100> two<00:04:49.370> together

on top and when your couple two together

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.390 
on top and when your couple two together
this<00:04:50.660> will<00:04:50.900> stop<00:04:51.020> a<00:04:51.169> panel<00:04:51.590> from<00:04:51.770> resonating

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
this will stop a panel from resonating

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.430 
this will stop a panel from resonating
and<00:04:52.940> if<00:04:53.030> you<00:04:53.150> have<00:04:53.300> a<00:04:53.330> noisy<00:04:53.840> exhaust<00:04:54.200> the

and if you have a noisy exhaust the

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.379 
and if you have a noisy exhaust the

other side of this panel you still might

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:58.029 
other side of this panel you still might
hear<00:04:56.720> the<00:04:56.930> exhaust<00:04:57.289> there<00:04:57.560> although<00:04:57.800> you've

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
hear the exhaust there although you've

00:04:58.039 --> 00:04:59.830 
hear the exhaust there although you've
stopped<00:04:58.250> the<00:04:58.370> resonance<00:04:58.849> from<00:04:59.060> this<00:04:59.300> or<00:04:59.539> to

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
stopped the resonance from this or to

not car restorers like Aston Martin for
example<00:05:24.740> there<00:05:24.949> a<00:05:24.979> problem<00:05:25.340> that<00:05:25.610> when<00:05:25.729> they

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:25.849 
example there a problem that when they

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:27.490 
example there a problem that when they
restore<00:05:26.210> these<00:05:26.330> vehicles<00:05:26.570> they<00:05:26.960> look<00:05:27.260> great

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
restore these vehicles they look great

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.409 
restore these vehicles they look great
they<00:05:27.560> run<00:05:27.949> great<00:05:28.250> they<00:05:28.699> still<00:05:28.970> feel<00:05:29.150> like<00:05:29.300> an

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
they run great they still feel like an

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:31.300 
they run great they still feel like an
old<00:05:29.570> car<00:05:29.810> and<00:05:30.050> they<00:05:30.110> get<00:05:30.260> really<00:05:30.650> really<00:05:30.949> hot

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
old car and they get really really hot

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.430 
old car and they get really really hot
in<00:05:31.520> the<00:05:31.610> summer<00:05:31.849> inside<00:05:32.300> and<00:05:32.630> that's<00:05:33.050> the<00:05:33.229> heat

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
in the summer inside and that's the heat

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.890 
in the summer inside and that's the heat
transfer<00:05:34.039> that<00:05:34.580> comes<00:05:34.880> from<00:05:35.150> the<00:05:35.360> engine<00:05:35.750> and

transfer that comes from the engine and

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.870 
transfer that comes from the engine and
the<00:05:35.960> gearbox<00:05:36.020> through<00:05:36.650> into<00:05:36.889> the<00:05:37.010> cabin<00:05:37.370> you

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
the gearbox through into the cabin you

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.879 
the gearbox through into the cabin you
put<00:05:38.120> this<00:05:38.270> on<00:05:38.510> here<00:05:38.720> with<00:05:39.080> the<00:05:39.110> dynamat<00:05:39.680> and

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:39.889 
put this on here with the dynamat and

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:41.680 
put this on here with the dynamat and
we've<00:05:40.280> proved<00:05:40.610> it<00:05:40.789> time<00:05:40.970> and<00:05:41.150> time<00:05:41.210> again<00:05:41.300> that

you<00:05:42.229> get<00:05:42.440> over<00:05:42.889> sixty<00:05:43.490> percent<00:05:43.580> drop<00:05:44.000> of<00:05:44.360> the

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 
you get over sixty percent drop of the

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.150 
you get over sixty percent drop of the
thermal<00:05:45.020> transfer<00:05:45.349> of<00:05:45.560> heat<00:05:45.650> from<00:05:45.800> the<00:05:46.070> engine

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 
thermal transfer of heat from the engine

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.219 
thermal transfer of heat from the engine
