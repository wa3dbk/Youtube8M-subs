00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:02.629 
know why would either of us have thought

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.800 
know why would either of us have thought
a<00:03:02.660> thing<00:03:02.959> about<00:03:03.109> it<00:03:03.470> while<00:03:04.160> we<00:03:04.190> ordered<00:03:04.849> it<00:03:05.030> but

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
much different opinion and what they

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.210 
much different opinion and what they
tried<00:03:11.390> to<00:03:11.420> base<00:03:11.780> their<00:03:12.079> case<00:03:12.349> on<00:03:12.590> was<00:03:13.190> a

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
tried to base their case on was a

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.089 
tried to base their case on was a
material<00:03:13.910> transfer<00:03:14.420> agreement<00:03:15.170> which<00:03:15.890> at

material transfer agreement which at

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.580 
material transfer agreement which at
best<00:03:16.599> even<00:03:17.599> if<00:03:17.750> we<00:03:17.900> broke<00:03:18.169> it<00:03:18.410> which

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
best even if we broke it which

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.979 
best even if we broke it which
apparently<00:03:18.829> we<00:03:19.250> did<00:03:19.459> not<00:03:19.669> but<00:03:20.540> even<00:03:20.840> if<00:03:20.959> we

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
apparently we did not but even if we

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.170 
apparently we did not but even if we
broke<00:03:21.380> a<00:03:21.440> material<00:03:22.040> transfer<00:03:22.430> agreement<00:03:23.030> the

broke a material transfer agreement the
worst<00:03:23.359> that<00:03:23.540> should<00:03:23.780> happen<00:03:23.959> would<00:03:24.319> be<00:03:24.349> a

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
worst that should happen would be a
