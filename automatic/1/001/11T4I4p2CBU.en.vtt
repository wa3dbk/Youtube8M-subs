you notice I only go once over my skin

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.390 
you notice I only go once over my skin
you<00:02:44.580> can<00:02:44.940> go<00:02:45.270> twice<00:02:45.600> if<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.650> wish<00:02:46.920> to<00:02:47.190> do<00:02:47.370> so

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
you can go twice if you wish to do so

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.780 
you can go twice if you wish to do so
but<00:02:47.670> I<00:02:48.239> only<00:02:48.450> go<00:02:48.660> once<00:02:49.010> please<00:02:50.010> do<00:02:50.250> not<00:02:50.370> go<00:02:50.580> more

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
but I only go once please do not go more

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.520 
but I only go once please do not go more
than<00:02:50.820> twice<00:02:51.209> because<00:02:51.540> your<00:02:51.750> skin<00:02:51.989> will<00:02:52.350> burn

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
than twice because your skin will burn

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.009 
than twice because your skin will burn
you<00:02:52.739> have<00:02:52.920> to<00:02:53.100> remember<00:02:53.340> that<00:02:53.550> this<00:02:53.820> is

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
you have to remember that this is

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.479 
you have to remember that this is
basically<00:02:55.019> removing<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.680> first<00:02:55.950> layer<00:02:56.220> off

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
basically removing the first layer off

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.790 
basically removing the first layer off
your<00:02:56.700> skin<00:02:57.120> so<00:02:57.780> if<00:02:57.870> you<00:02:57.959> go<00:02:58.080> more<00:02:58.110> than<00:02:58.440> twice

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
your skin so if you go more than twice

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.580 
your skin so if you go more than twice
it's<00:02:59.100> very<00:02:59.550> very<00:02:59.910> risky<00:03:00.570> and<00:03:00.780> I<00:03:01.170> just<00:03:01.350> would

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
it's very very risky and I just would

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.280 
it's very very risky and I just would
not<00:03:01.800> recommend<00:03:02.310> that<00:03:02.400> at<00:03:02.640> all<00:03:02.989> since<00:03:03.989> you<00:03:04.170> are

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
not recommend that at all since you are

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.140 
not recommend that at all since you are
removing<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.920> first<00:03:05.160> layer<00:03:05.430> off<00:03:05.670> your<00:03:05.910> skin

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
removing the first layer off your skin

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.550 
removing the first layer off your skin
