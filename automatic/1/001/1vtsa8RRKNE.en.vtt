00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.510
 a very interesting dish and that 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.780
 quinoa buffer on paprika was good which 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.559
 ingredients tomorrow we quinoa paprika us 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:52.040
 have sunflower oil vegetable stock here 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:53.450

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.710
 pepper and onions 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.930
 First of all we should take the water 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.379
 bring to a boil and quinoa in it 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.790
 Cook 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.550
 The water is a bit too 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:13.970
 with vegetable broth , what will you do then? 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:15.619
 the children about band the cinema now 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.790
 cooks we prepare best fits 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.729
 paprika in front 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.840
 We cut the onions first since 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.280
 we do fall out though 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.280
 exactly the dice was 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.970
 the onions are now cut the 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.799
 can go back to the shell then 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.440
 even if it's just a clove of garlic whole 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.220
 finely chopped and the paprika we would have 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.220
 Then also finely dice 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:16.410
 we have to go to the cinema for a moment 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:18.360
 pour off the sweat because now the 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.610
 onions equal and also equip the 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.209
 paprika likes to delete it then with 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.600
 leprosy then comes africa and noble 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.600
 also to 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:57.120
 We'll continue with the ticket office 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:57.120
 for the buffer of two only need 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.780
 had to cool because of that 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.680
 that would stop then right now 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.190
 if we put that in there 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:16.420
 that's right, it's good in there spice up the whole 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:17.739
 can still like with salt and pepper too 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.870
 a bit of vegetables probably in the powder yet 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.980
 turn it on 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.590
 although that is already in the boiling water 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:31.390
 was inside 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:35.069
 then we lose the whole thing around them 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:38.769
 advise a banner 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:41.829
 For this you take sunflower seed in height 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:44.829
 We'll give you a small trowel here 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:47.859
 quinoa mass in the pan or something 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:54.850
 Swivel small thaler little small heaps 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:58.019
 through again and then we can 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.019
