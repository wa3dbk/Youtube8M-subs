 welcome nessi this week 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.070
 we obviously had some news 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.160
 who bombed in the nerd universe and we here 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.880
 Let's discuss some of them for you. 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:24.390
 which logically you have already seen which are 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.420
 a title of this video and let's start 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.660
 talking on teaser trailer leaked from 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.610
 catholic 3 civil war that many are 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.340
 speaking it is false but I honestly 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.670
 in my humble opinion I believe that the 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.829
 video sim is light sale interrupted in 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.570
 our schedule to advertise trail 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.730
 of captain america is false so the 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.620
 persist the symptoms of electrons in 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.030
 Whats up, we warn you 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.860
 that this video was recorded with 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.600
 advance and affection law adopted in 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.750
 case of suspected dengue 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.750
 doctor 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.530
 in the second point it is about the series of 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.020
 demolisher 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.220
 according to the site latino review who in 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:11.010
 live the second season villain edson 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:13.290
 is in the esthete hodgson last film 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.020
 he was fast and furious is cooler 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:20.400
 is that they want the actor alive 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:22.470
 mercenary the hero of marvel 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.210
 following a select eye is also 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.759
 in this new season the second season 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.610
 will be practically the same training as 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.610
 we see in the Breaker movie in 2003 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.660
 Would you like to see divisions made as 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.479
 mercenary in the demolisher series 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:48.149
 comment below and last we go 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:52.110
 talk about the suicide squad joker at 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.899
 scary joker scary joker 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.850
 scott if your child is the client and this 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.530
 will play a role that still 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.080
 unknown in the movie squad if so 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.110
 the point is that during an interview the 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.830
 actor revealed that the entire cast had 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.890
 a fear of waking up straight when he 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.680
 was incarnating fear joker 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.900
 Imagine if he did not take this action to 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.380
 Serious or what we can expect 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.930
 is that it is something different from 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.930
 jack nicolson this new joker has a 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.870
 personality is scary 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.209
 somber a laugh of his own 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.430
 way and I honestly think it's 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.670
 exactly what will happen 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.849
 And you think of a gardener will make a 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:42.720
 good joker in theaters 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:44.550
 I think so, but every hour will be 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.680
 a lot for amanda come 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.900
