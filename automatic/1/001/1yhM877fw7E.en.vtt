a guy's mind when he's got to sit there
in<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.369> stands<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:17.789> watch<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.359> then<00:00:18.750> no<00:00:18.869> is

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020

tournaments<00:00:19.350> over<00:00:19.410> well<00:00:20.010> you<00:00:20.730> realize<00:00:20.820> you

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
tournaments over well you realize you

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.580 
tournaments over well you realize you
don't<00:00:21.119> have<00:00:21.270> control<00:00:21.480> anymore<00:00:21.810> so<00:00:22.260> your

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
don't have control anymore so your

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.679 
don't have control anymore so your
future<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.039> in<00:00:23.250> hands<00:00:23.609> for<00:00:24.060> example<00:00:24.420> Trent's

Paulsen futures in the hands up spyridon
off<00:00:27.150> from<00:00:27.750> Kazakhstan<00:00:28.349> so<00:00:28.769> Kazakhstan<00:00:29.250> has<00:00:29.279> to

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
off from Kazakhstan so Kazakhstan has to

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.040 
off from Kazakhstan so Kazakhstan has to
beat<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.939> Iran<00:00:30.179> Ian<00:00:30.390> for<00:00:30.630> him<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.900> have<00:00:30.990> a

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
beat the Iran Ian for him to have a

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
chance to potentially move on so I think

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.270 
chance to potentially move on so I think
it<00:00:33.300> has<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.989> be<00:00:34.110> just<00:00:34.350> real<00:00:34.770> frustrating

countries<00:01:34.409> they<00:01:34.979> just<00:01:35.189> spend<00:01:35.430> way<00:01:35.640> more<00:01:35.670> time

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
countries they just spend way more time

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.210 
countries they just spend way more time
there<00:01:36.479> than<00:01:36.720> we<00:01:37.170> do<00:01:37.380> because<00:01:37.619> in<00:01:37.860> college

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
there than we do because in college

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.800 
there than we do because in college
right<00:01:38.369> we<00:01:38.579> build<00:01:38.790> up<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:38.970> maybe<00:01:39.360> just<00:01:39.509> happen

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
right we build up that maybe just happen

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.440 
right we build up that maybe just happen
one<00:01:39.990> time<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.530> whole<00:01:40.979> entire<00:01:41.189> match<00:01:41.460> we're

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
one time and a whole entire match we're

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.179 
one time and a whole entire match we're
freestyle<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.350> happens<00:01:43.710> usually<00:01:43.860> almost

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
freestyle it happens usually almost

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.429 
freestyle it happens usually almost
every<00:01:44.430> single<00:01:44.729> time<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.909> period<00:01:45.420> so<00:01:46.079> we<00:01:46.259> just

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
every single time a period so we just

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.260 
every single time a period so we just
need<00:01:46.530> we<00:01:46.979> need<00:01:47.009> more<00:01:47.490> time<00:01:47.670> Russell<00:01:48.119> from

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
need we need more time Russell from

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.630 
need we need more time Russell from
situations<00:01:48.869> or

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
situations or

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.460 
situations or
what<00:01:50.270> about<00:01:50.360> parterre<00:01:50.810> work<00:01:50.990> it<00:01:51.140> didn't<00:01:51.350> seem

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
what about parterre work it didn't seem

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.800 
what about parterre work it didn't seem
like<00:01:51.530> when<00:01:52.370> us<00:01:52.850> thrusters<00:01:53.150> got<00:01:53.300> on<00:01:53.420> top<00:01:53.600> they

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
like when us thrusters got on top they

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.630 
like when us thrusters got on top they
were<00:01:53.870> really<00:01:54.140> effective<00:01:55.130> at<00:01:55.220> scoring<00:01:55.460> from

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
were really effective at scoring from

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.010 
were really effective at scoring from
the<00:01:55.760> top<00:01:55.940> what<00:01:56.210> needs<00:01:56.360> to<00:01:56.420> be<00:01:56.510> done<00:01:56.540> there<00:01:56.720> I

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
the top what needs to be done there I

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.810 
the top what needs to be done there I
think<00:01:57.650> we<00:01:57.740> need<00:01:57.800> to<00:01:57.890> continue<00:01:58.159> drill<00:01:58.490> on<00:01:58.640> top

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
think we need to continue drill on top

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.550 
think we need to continue drill on top
but<00:01:59.060> i<00:01:59.119> think<00:01:59.630> you<00:01:59.659> know<00:01:59.780> we<00:01:59.930> didn't<00:02:00.200> we<00:02:00.409> have<00:02:00.530> a

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
but i think you know we didn't we have a

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.410 
but i think you know we didn't we have a
loss<00:02:00.740> to<00:02:00.890> period<00:02:01.220> today<00:02:01.970> because<00:02:02.240> we<00:02:02.330> got

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
turned and that's for more because we

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.880 
turned and that's for more because we
didn't<00:02:05.360> get<00:02:05.450> a<00:02:05.510> turn<00:02:05.720> per<00:02:05.900> se<00:02:06.080> I<00:02:06.259> mean<00:02:06.619> we<00:02:06.740> lost

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
I'd say he's won the top four five best

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.350 
I'd say he's won the top four five best
guys<00:02:55.280> in<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.489> world<00:02:55.549> you<00:02:55.970> know<00:02:56.060> a<00:02:56.090> trend

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
guys in the world you know a trend

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.479 
guys in the world you know a trend
adding<00:02:56.630> beat<00:02:56.780> I<00:02:56.959> think<00:02:57.170> that<00:02:57.320> trans<00:02:57.769> just<00:02:58.040> real

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
adding beat I think that trans just real

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.100 
adding beat I think that trans just real
smaller<00:02:58.850> details<00:02:59.180> I<00:02:59.480> think<00:02:59.660> for<00:02:59.780> him<00:02:59.900> is<00:03:00.079> just

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
smaller details I think for him is just

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.259 
smaller details I think for him is just
getting<00:03:00.440> better<00:03:00.530> at<00:03:01.160> keeping<00:03:01.400> guys<00:03:01.700> off<00:03:01.760> his

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
getting better at keeping guys off his

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:03.550 
getting better at keeping guys off his
legs<00:03:02.480> I<00:03:02.660> think<00:03:02.840> he<00:03:02.930> feels<00:03:03.049> really<00:03:03.350> comfortable

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
legs I think he feels really comfortable

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.280 
legs I think he feels really comfortable
in<00:03:04.310> that<00:03:04.340> for<00:03:04.549> a<00:03:04.610> headlock<00:03:04.820> position<00:03:05.299> on<00:03:05.810> any<00:03:06.200> I

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
in that for a headlock position on any I

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.050 
in that for a headlock position on any I
think<00:03:06.650> because<00:03:06.980> he<00:03:07.010> scores<00:03:07.400> so<00:03:07.579> many<00:03:07.760> points

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
think because he scores so many points

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.479 
think because he scores so many points
there<00:03:08.180> special<00:03:08.570> United<00:03:08.870> States<00:03:09.140> he<00:03:10.100> lets<00:03:10.280> guys

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
there special United States he lets guys

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.400 
there special United States he lets guys
getting<00:03:11.420> his<00:03:11.510> legs<00:03:11.720> a<00:03:11.840> little<00:03:11.900> too<00:03:12.079> often

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
getting his legs a little too often

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:13.630 
getting his legs a little too often
because<00:03:12.500> he<00:03:12.680> scores<00:03:12.980> a<00:03:13.040> lot<00:03:13.130> of<00:03:13.220> points<00:03:13.489> there

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
because he scores a lot of points there

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.220 
because he scores a lot of points there
so<00:03:14.060> I<00:03:14.120> thinking<00:03:14.420> beat<00:03:14.600> ninety-five<00:03:15.140> percent

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
so I thinking beat ninety-five percent

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.470 
so I thinking beat ninety-five percent
of<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:15.500> world<00:03:15.709> there<00:03:16.010> but<00:03:16.970> the<00:03:17.180> other<00:03:17.269> five

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
of the world there but the other five

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.970 
of the world there but the other five
percent<00:03:17.810> that's<00:03:17.900> who's<00:03:18.200> in<00:03:18.350> this<00:03:18.470> arena<00:03:18.709> right

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
percent that's who's in this arena right

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.620 
percent that's who's in this arena right
now<00:03:19.190> so<00:03:19.730> he's<00:03:19.880> gonna<00:03:20.000> have<00:03:20.120> to<00:03:20.269> get<00:03:20.360> a<00:03:20.420> little

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
now so he's gonna have to get a little

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.120 
now so he's gonna have to get a little
bit<00:03:20.720> better<00:03:20.840> sprawling<00:03:21.350> stuffing<00:03:21.920> the<00:03:21.980> guy's

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
bit better sprawling stuffing the guy's

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.640 
bit better sprawling stuffing the guy's
head<00:03:22.340> 1911<00:03:23.060> gets<00:03:23.299> his<00:03:23.450> legs<00:03:23.720> if<00:03:24.019> they<00:03:24.380> fight

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
head 1911 gets his legs if they fight

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.380 
head 1911 gets his legs if they fight
the<00:03:24.799> rear<00:03:24.980> up<00:03:25.100> to<00:03:25.220> get<00:03:25.340> there<00:03:25.489> then<00:03:25.820> he<00:03:26.090> can<00:03:26.239> go

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
the rear up to get there then he can go

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.449 
the rear up to get there then he can go
to<00:03:26.450> bring<00:03:26.720> a<00:03:26.780> lot<00:03:26.959> but<00:03:27.470> just<00:03:27.650> a<00:03:27.829> little<00:03:28.010> bit<00:03:28.190> I

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
to bring a lot but just a little bit I

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.370 
to bring a lot but just a little bit I
think<00:03:28.910> better<00:03:29.150> baseline<00:03:29.690> defense<00:03:30.079> for<00:03:30.260> him

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
think better baseline defense for him

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.840 
think better baseline defense for him
and<00:03:30.590> that's<00:03:30.860> the<00:03:31.040> difference<00:03:31.220> maker<00:03:31.519> for<00:03:31.700> him

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
and that's the difference maker for him

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.370 
and that's the difference maker for him
I'm<00:03:32.239> he<00:03:32.420> went<00:03:32.600> out<00:03:32.690> there<00:03:32.810> you<00:03:32.930> had<00:03:33.049> to<00:03:33.170> get<00:03:33.290> to

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
I'm he went out there you had to get to

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.110 
I'm he went out there you had to get to
take<00:03:33.560> down<00:03:33.709> in<00:03:34.130> the<00:03:34.220> first<00:03:34.400> proof<00:03:34.610> he<00:03:34.730> got<00:03:34.940> it

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
take down in the first proof he got it

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.430 
take down in the first proof he got it
he<00:03:35.269> had<00:03:35.480> to<00:03:35.630> get<00:03:35.690> that<00:03:35.810> take<00:03:36.019> down<00:03:36.170> the<00:03:36.290> third

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
he had to get that take down the third

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.770 
he had to get that take down the third
period<00:03:36.590> he<00:03:36.739> got<00:03:36.950> it<00:03:37.160> also<00:03:37.610> single<00:03:38.090> eggs<00:03:38.239> but

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
period he got it also single eggs but

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.660 
period he got it also single eggs but
