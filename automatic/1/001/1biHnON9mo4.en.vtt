beauty<00:00:35.040> they<00:00:35.160> just<00:00:35.450> just<00:00:36.450> go<00:00:36.660> right<00:00:36.840> here

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
beauty they just just go right here

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.810 
beauty they just just go right here
actually<00:00:37.680> i<00:00:37.710> didn't<00:00:37.950> see<00:00:38.070> this<00:00:38.190> before<00:00:38.280> i<00:00:38.640> use

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
actually i didn't see this before i use

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.930 
actually i didn't see this before i use
my<00:00:39.440> teleport<00:00:40.440> earlier<00:00:41.040> but<00:00:41.430> you're<00:00:41.760> just

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
my teleport earlier but you're just

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.299 
my teleport earlier but you're just
going<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.120> want<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.360> walk<00:00:42.540> down<00:00:42.780> here<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.440> think

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
going to want to walk down here I think

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.850 
going to want to walk down here I think
this<00:00:44.430> one's<00:00:44.690> probably<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.989> bit<00:00:46.289> easier<00:00:46.649> than

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
this one's probably a bit easier than

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.639 
this one's probably a bit easier than
the<00:00:47.039> last<00:00:47.280> one<00:00:47.750> hopefully<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:48.809> won't<00:00:48.930> fail<00:00:49.440> this

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
the last one hopefully I won't fail this

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.869 
the last one hopefully I won't fail this
time<00:00:49.890> um<00:00:51.590> alright<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:52.949> started<00:00:53.399> on<00:00:53.489> here

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
time um alright so you started on here

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.990 
time um alright so you started on here
and<00:00:54.590> it's<00:00:55.590> pretty<00:00:55.860> simple<00:00:56.430> just<00:00:58.370> jump<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.609> don't

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
and it's pretty simple just jump I don't

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.650 
and it's pretty simple just jump I don't
know<00:01:00.289> this<00:01:01.609> that's<00:01:02.609> probably<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.300> hardest

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
know this that's probably the hardest

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.429 
know this that's probably the hardest
part<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.799> just<00:01:05.760> tiny<00:01:06.450> landing<00:01:06.930> spot<00:01:07.260> you

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
part of it just tiny landing spot you

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.390 
part of it just tiny landing spot you
have<00:01:07.590> but<00:01:08.369> even<00:01:08.610> that's<00:01:08.880> not<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.270> bad<00:01:10.250> jump<00:01:11.250> to

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
have but even that's not so bad jump to

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.310 
have but even that's not so bad jump to
there<00:01:12.229> to<00:01:13.229> there<00:01:14.780> something<00:01:15.780> else<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:16.110> learned

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
there to there something else I learned

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.280 
there to there something else I learned
um<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:17.130> think<00:01:17.189> all<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.180> loot<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.659> get<00:01:18.930> from

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
um I think all the loot you get from

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.770 
um I think all the loot you get from
mobs<00:01:19.590> anything<00:01:20.490> scales<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.119> your<00:01:21.240> level<00:01:21.920> so

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
mobs anything scales to your level so

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.380 
mobs anything scales to your level so
you<00:01:24.780> might<00:01:25.020> want<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.380> save<00:01:25.619> these<00:01:25.920> for<00:01:26.520> until

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
you might want to save these for until

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.960 
you might want to save these for until
you're<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.600> high<00:01:27.840> level<00:01:28.259> higher<00:01:28.560> level<00:01:29.070> just

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
you're a high level higher level just

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.080 
you're a high level higher level just
because<00:01:30.590> if<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.920> get<00:01:32.100> gear<00:01:32.400> from<00:01:32.549> this<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.000> it

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
because if you get gear from this and it

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.810 
because if you get gear from this and it
scales<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.659> let's<00:01:33.840> say<00:01:33.990> 80<00:01:34.549> obviously<00:01:35.549> it's

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
scales to let's say 80 obviously it's

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.950 
scales to let's say 80 obviously it's
going<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.030> be<00:01:36.150> worth<00:01:36.360> more<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:38.509> better<00:01:39.509> for

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
going to be worth more and better for

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.000 
going to be worth more and better for
you

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
you

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.040 
you
and<00:01:41.550> it's<00:01:41.850> like<00:01:42.000> an<00:01:42.120> easier<00:01:42.420> way<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.600> getting

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
and it's like an easier way of getting

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.370 
and it's like an easier way of getting
gear<00:01:43.800> for<00:01:44.070> your<00:01:44.220> level<00:01:44.720> which<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.840> really<00:01:46.080> like

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
gear for your level which I really like

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.730 
gear for your level which I really like
how<00:01:46.800> it<00:01:46.860> scales<00:01:47.570> and<00:01:48.570> then<00:01:48.810> once<00:01:49.500> you're<00:01:49.650> up

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
how it scales and then once you're up

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.790 
how it scales and then once you're up
here<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:49.980> got<00:01:50.190> tricked<00:01:50.520> up<00:01:50.760> here<00:01:51.200> just<00:01:52.200> get<00:01:52.500> you

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
here I got tricked up here just get you

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.680 
here I got tricked up here just get you
don't<00:01:53.010> go<00:01:53.130> through<00:01:53.340> there<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.550> jump<00:01:54.450> right

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
don't go through there you jump right

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.800 
don't go through there you jump right
onto<00:01:54.930> here<00:01:55.910> that's<00:01:56.910> it<00:01:57.710> you're<00:01:58.710> up<00:01:58.830> here<00:01:59.810> it's

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
onto here that's it you're up here it's

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:09.540 
onto here that's it you're up here it's
all<00:02:00.930> pretty<00:02:01.170> simple<00:02:01.560> from<00:02:01.770> here

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.910 

I'm<00:02:10.060> going<00:02:10.210> to<00:02:10.270> keep<00:02:10.479> you<00:02:10.630> guys<00:02:10.750> posted<00:02:10.810> on<00:02:11.440> as

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
I'm going to keep you guys posted on as

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.480 
I'm going to keep you guys posted on as
many<00:02:12.280> of<00:02:12.460> these<00:02:12.550> I<00:02:12.760> find<00:02:13.090> um<00:02:14.050> I<00:02:14.770> might<00:02:15.280> actually

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
many of these I find um I might actually

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.930 
many of these I find um I might actually
start<00:02:15.940> saving<00:02:16.420> some<00:02:17.310> like<00:02:18.310> I<00:02:18.430> said<00:02:18.640> until<00:02:18.880> a

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
start saving some like I said until a

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.850 
start saving some like I said until a
higher<00:02:19.180> level<00:02:19.540> but<00:02:20.020> I'll<00:02:20.140> definitely<00:02:20.290> if<00:02:20.740> I

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
higher level but I'll definitely if I

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.320 
higher level but I'll definitely if I
see<00:02:21.100> 1<00:02:21.280> i'll<00:02:21.310> show<00:02:21.580> you<00:02:21.640> how<00:02:21.730> to<00:02:21.850> get<00:02:22.060> to<00:02:22.210> that

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
see 1 i'll show you how to get to that

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.960 
see 1 i'll show you how to get to that
and<00:02:22.690> then<00:02:23.440> once<00:02:23.770> you<00:02:23.890> get<00:02:24.040> up<00:02:24.130> here<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:24.670> chest

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
and then once you get up here the chest
