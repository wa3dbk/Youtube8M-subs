00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
here in the screen I see bare wood here

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.029 
here in the screen I see bare wood here
in<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.050> middle<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.440> stripe<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.860> green

right here and a stripe of green right
here<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:51.949> can<00:00:52.949> definitely<00:00:53.160> make<00:00:53.520> out<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.730> little

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
here I can definitely make out a little

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.299 
here I can definitely make out a little
bit<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.120> pinstriping<00:00:54.719> on<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:55.110> I'm<00:00:55.440> seeing

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
bit of pinstriping on this I'm seeing

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.099 
bit of pinstriping on this I'm seeing
greens<00:00:57.199> like<00:00:58.199> right<00:00:58.410> there<00:00:59.570> I've<00:01:00.570> seen<00:01:00.840> some

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
greens like right there I've seen some

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.579 
greens like right there I've seen some
lay<00:01:01.590> off<00:01:01.890> that's<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.160> blue<00:01:03.290> well<00:01:04.290> what<00:01:04.409> color

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
lay off that's a blue well what color

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.109 
lay off that's a blue well what color
that<00:01:04.799> would<00:01:04.949> have<00:01:05.070> been<00:01:05.220> it's<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:05.580> FEA<00:01:05.880> it's

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
that would have been it's so FEA it's

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.640 
that would have been it's so FEA it's
hard<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.390> tell<00:01:06.600> if<00:01:06.750> that's<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.080> color<00:01:07.320> would

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
hard to tell if that's the color would

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.630 
hard to tell if that's the color would
have<00:01:07.799> been<00:01:08.040> or<00:01:08.340> if<00:01:08.700> it's<00:01:09.150> just<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.420> faded<00:01:09.689> out

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640

have been or if it's just a faded out
maybe<00:01:11.640> faded<00:01:12.180> out<00:01:12.299> green<00:01:12.689> I'm<00:01:12.869> not<00:01:12.990> exactly

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
is enough pieces here where I should be

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.809 
is enough pieces here where I should be
able<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.439> reproduce<00:02:07.860> them<00:02:08.099> all<00:02:08.280> about<00:02:08.640> too

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
able to reproduce them all about too

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.839 
able to reproduce them all about too
much<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.149> problem

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
much of a problem

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.580 
much of a problem
see<00:02:11.849> all<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.150> insides<00:02:12.630> are<00:02:12.870> here<00:02:13.110> let<00:02:13.349> me<00:02:13.440> move

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
see all the insides are here let me move

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.250 
see all the insides are here let me move
my<00:02:13.770> light<00:02:14.239> this<00:02:15.239> here<00:02:15.480> mounts<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:15.959> the<00:02:16.050> top

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
my light this here mounts to the top

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.220 
my light this here mounts to the top
this<00:02:16.500> is<00:02:16.560> where<00:02:16.770> you<00:02:16.860> feed<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.190> corn<00:02:17.430> in

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
this is where you feed the corn in

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.870 
this is where you feed the corn in
there's<00:02:19.230> a<00:02:19.290> little<00:02:19.410> chute<00:02:19.709> and<00:02:20.430> what<00:02:20.640> it<00:02:20.730> does

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
there's a little chute and what it does

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.610 
there's a little chute and what it does
is<00:02:21.060> it<00:02:21.180> rubs<00:02:21.360> against<00:02:21.660> these<00:02:21.959> gears<00:02:22.290> in<00:02:22.470> here

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
is it rubs against these gears in here

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.510 
is it rubs against these gears in here
and<00:02:22.709> I'll<00:02:22.770> show<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:22.980> how<00:02:23.069> that<00:02:23.099> works<00:02:23.280> in<00:02:23.430> a

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
and I'll show you how that works in a

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.890 
and I'll show you how that works in a
second<00:02:24.260> missing<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.349> front<00:02:25.530> panel<00:02:25.950> here

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
second missing the front panel here

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.090 
second missing the front panel here
there<00:02:27.900> would<00:02:28.020> be<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.140> panel<00:02:28.620> right<00:02:28.739> here<00:02:28.950> going

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
there would be a panel right here going

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.860 
there would be a panel right here going
across<00:02:29.220> like<00:02:29.900> this<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:33.300> corn<00:02:33.569> would<00:02:33.690> just

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
across like this and the corn would just

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.390 
across like this and the corn would just
drop<00:02:34.110> down<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.620> bottom<00:02:34.650> I<00:02:34.980> think<00:02:35.010> you'd<00:02:35.280> be

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
drop down to the bottom I think you'd be

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.600 
drop down to the bottom I think you'd be
a<00:02:35.430> hole<00:02:35.819> I<00:02:36.120> don't<00:02:36.900> think<00:02:37.290> this<00:02:37.440> whole<00:02:37.650> gizmo

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
a hole I don't think this whole gizmo

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.130 
a hole I don't think this whole gizmo
here<00:02:38.819> is<00:02:38.940> original<00:02:39.390> it<00:02:39.480> could<00:02:39.510> be<00:02:39.840> but<00:02:39.989> I<00:02:40.080> don't

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
here is original it could be but I don't

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.140 
here is original it could be but I don't
think<00:02:40.349> it<00:02:40.530> is<00:02:40.700> she<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.730> think<00:02:41.819> there<00:02:42.030> was<00:02:42.120> a

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
think it is she I think there was a

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.000 
think it is she I think there was a
panel<00:02:42.540> right<00:02:42.690> here<00:02:42.890> and<00:02:43.890> I<00:02:44.010> believe<00:02:44.310> that<00:02:44.610> this

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
panel right here and I believe that this

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.430 
panel right here and I believe that this
might<00:02:47.010> have<00:02:47.160> been<00:02:47.660> added<00:02:48.660> on<00:02:48.780> later<00:02:48.810> after

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
might have been added on later after

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.360 
might have been added on later after
that<00:02:49.560> panel<00:02:49.860> fell<00:02:50.100> out<00:02:51.739> y:real<00:02:52.739> appears<00:02:53.069> to<00:02:53.220> be

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
that panel fell out y:real appears to be

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.630 
that panel fell out y:real appears to be
in<00:02:53.880> good<00:02:54.030> shape<00:02:54.090> just<00:02:54.630> a<00:02:54.959> little<00:02:55.110> rusty

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
in good shape just a little rusty

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.900 
in good shape just a little rusty
nothing<00:02:56.640> I<00:02:56.700> can't<00:02:56.940> fix<00:02:57.890> let<00:02:58.890> me<00:02:58.950> move<00:02:59.069> my<00:02:59.130> light

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.190 

what<00:03:02.910> we<00:03:03.000> got<00:03:03.150> going<00:03:03.450> on<00:03:03.540> here<00:03:03.780> this<00:03:03.900> cage

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
what we got going on here this cage

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.100 
what we got going on here this cage
looking<00:03:04.590> thing<00:03:05.569> I'll<00:03:06.569> show<00:03:06.780> you<00:03:06.870> how<00:03:06.959> that

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
looking thing I'll show you how that

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.229 
looking thing I'll show you how that
works<00:03:07.200> in<00:03:07.440> just<00:03:07.470> a<00:03:07.650> second<00:03:08.010> come<00:03:09.000> around<00:03:09.120> to

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
works in just a second come around to

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.940 
works in just a second come around to
this<00:03:09.360> side<00:03:10.459> okay<00:03:11.459> here's<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.790> gears<00:03:12.090> that

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
this side okay here's the gears that

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.360 
this side okay here's the gears that
operate<00:03:13.950> from<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.489> hand<00:03:14.700> crank<00:03:16.130> what<00:03:17.130> it<00:03:17.190> does

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
operate from the hand crank what it does

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.449 
operate from the hand crank what it does
is<00:03:17.549> it<00:03:17.670> transistor<00:03:18.209> thing<00:03:18.329> right<00:03:18.540> here<00:03:19.459> when

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
is it transistor thing right here when

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.039 
is it transistor thing right here when
the<00:03:20.489> corn<00:03:20.820> goes<00:03:21.000> down<00:03:21.269> that<00:03:21.510> chute<00:03:21.810> right

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
the corn goes down that chute right

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.520 
the corn goes down that chute right
there<00:03:23.060> it<00:03:24.060> rubs<00:03:24.359> against<00:03:24.780> this<00:03:24.930> thing<00:03:25.230> here

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
there it rubs against this thing here

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.289 
there it rubs against this thing here
which<00:03:26.220> pulls<00:03:26.609> the<00:03:26.880> kernels<00:03:27.359> off<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:28.440> cob

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
which pulls the kernels off the cob

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.080 
which pulls the kernels off the cob
these<00:03:30.299> things<00:03:30.630> here<00:03:30.840> cause<00:03:31.370> it's<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.910> cause

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
these things here cause it's the cause

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.050 
these things here cause it's the cause
of<00:03:33.120> cob<00:03:33.510> to<00:03:33.660> rotate<00:03:34.109> against<00:03:34.739> that<00:03:34.920> as<00:03:35.250> they're

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
of cob to rotate against that as they're

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.509 
of cob to rotate against that as they're
pulling<00:03:36.390> the<00:03:36.480> kernels<00:03:36.840> off<00:03:37.310> when<00:03:38.310> all<00:03:38.400> the

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
pulling the kernels off when all the

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.210 
pulling the kernels off when all the
kernels<00:03:38.760> get<00:03:39.060> removed<00:03:39.420> this<00:03:40.109> is<00:03:40.170> has<00:03:40.769> a<00:03:40.799> spring

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
kernels get removed this is has a spring

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.479 
kernels get removed this is has a spring
in<00:03:41.250> it<00:03:41.430> which<00:03:41.579> pushes<00:03:41.910> it<00:03:42.180> against<00:03:42.600> that<00:03:43.489> and

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
in it which pushes it against that and

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.960 
in it which pushes it against that and
pulls<00:03:45.030> it<00:03:45.180> down<00:03:45.209> in<00:03:45.570> as<00:03:46.079> it's<00:03:46.320> spinning<00:03:46.650> and<00:03:46.970> as

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
pulls it down in as it's spinning and as

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.220 
pulls it down in as it's spinning and as
the<00:03:48.060> crowns<00:03:48.299> get<00:03:48.480> pulled<00:03:48.660> off<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:48.870> cob<00:03:49.049> the

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
the crowns get pulled off the cob the

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.660 
the crowns get pulled off the cob the
cob<00:03:49.410> will<00:03:49.560> drop<00:03:49.829> down<00:03:50.100> into<00:03:50.250> that<00:03:50.400> cage

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
cob will drop down into that cage

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:51.979 
cob will drop down into that cage
looking<00:03:51.000> thing<00:03:51.209> right<00:03:51.359> there<00:03:51.540> I'm<00:03:51.660> shining<00:03:51.900> my

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
looking thing right there I'm shining my

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.009 
looking thing right there I'm shining my
light<00:03:52.489> and<00:03:53.489> the<00:03:53.819> bare<00:03:54.000> cob<00:03:54.269> will<00:03:54.450> pop<00:03:54.660> out<00:03:54.810> this

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
light and the bare cob will pop out this

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.069 
light and the bare cob will pop out this
hole<00:03:55.200> here<00:03:56.269> so<00:03:57.269> the<00:03:57.390> kernels<00:03:57.750> have<00:03:57.840> dropped

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
hole here so the kernels have dropped

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:00.949 
hole here so the kernels have dropped
down<00:03:58.260> at<00:03:58.650> the<00:03:58.799> bottom<00:03:59.540> underneath<00:04:00.540> into<00:04:00.870> a

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
down at the bottom underneath into a

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.140 
down at the bottom underneath into a
bucket<00:04:01.230> and<00:04:01.980> then<00:04:02.220> these<00:04:02.370> will<00:04:02.609> just<00:04:02.760> the<00:04:02.940> cob

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
bucket and then these will just the cob

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.670 
bucket and then these will just the cob
will<00:04:03.359> pop<00:04:03.510> out<00:04:03.660> this<00:04:03.930> side<00:04:04.200> and<00:04:04.380> they'll<00:04:04.470> pile

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
will pop out this side and they'll pile

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.220 
will pop out this side and they'll pile
or<00:04:04.890> something<00:04:05.250> so<00:04:05.840> they're<00:04:06.840> a<00:04:06.870> pretty

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
or something so they're a pretty

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.590 
or something so they're a pretty
efficient<00:04:07.680> machine<00:04:08.040> and<00:04:08.569> they<00:04:09.569> help<00:04:09.810> farmers

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
efficient machine and they help farmers

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.180 
efficient machine and they help farmers
drastically<00:04:12.600> increase<00:04:13.410> their<00:04:13.650> speed<00:04:13.889> of

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
drastically increase their speed of

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.390 
drastically increase their speed of
shell<00:04:14.880> and<00:04:15.030> korn<00:04:15.919> instead<00:04:16.919> of<00:04:17.010> doing<00:04:17.220> it<00:04:17.280> by

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
shell and korn instead of doing it by

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.550 
shell and korn instead of doing it by
hand<00:04:17.820> it's<00:04:18.570> a<00:04:18.630> really<00:04:18.840> old<00:04:18.959> fashioned<00:04:19.380> way

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
hand it's a really old fashioned way

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.440 
hand it's a really old fashioned way
you'd<00:04:20.340> use<00:04:20.519> this<00:04:20.669> machine<00:04:20.909> and<00:04:21.269> it<00:04:21.330> would

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
you'd use this machine and it would

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.659 
you'd use this machine and it would
really<00:04:21.630> speed<00:04:21.989> up<00:04:22.019> their<00:04:22.260> production

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
really speed up their production

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.740 
really speed up their production
so<00:04:24.669> I<00:04:24.730> believe<00:04:24.940> this<00:04:25.060> will<00:04:25.210> turn<00:04:25.389> into<00:04:25.480> a<00:04:25.540> nice

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
so I believe this will turn into a nice

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.600 
so I believe this will turn into a nice
restoration<00:04:26.260> project<00:04:26.980> I<00:04:27.100> mean<00:04:27.250> there's<00:04:27.400> not

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
restoration project I mean there's not

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.110 
restoration project I mean there's not
here<00:04:27.880> to<00:04:28.000> work<00:04:28.180> with<00:04:28.919> it<00:04:29.919> is<00:04:30.100> pretty<00:04:30.460> rough<00:04:30.669> but

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
here to work with it is pretty rough but

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.330 
here to work with it is pretty rough but
I<00:04:31.360> think<00:04:32.050> I<00:04:32.229> can<00:04:32.380> say<00:04:32.590> that<00:04:32.800> makes<00:04:33.010> something

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
I think I can say that makes something

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.140 
I think I can say that makes something
nice<00:04:33.520> out<00:04:33.729> of<00:04:33.790> it

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
nice out of it

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.900 
nice out of it
