00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.710
 boring I do not want to know, will I come? 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:24.440

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.900
 one point here is the r7 it comes along 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:50.590
 No, we are going to follow the invoice that I 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:53.090

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.910
 Interesting people here, nice people. 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.700
 even in seven years 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.500
 it is not seen that there are no 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.570
 accessories here in Brazil for you 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.570
 buy xbox wine 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.550
 At least I did not think the 1 is precarious 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:12.470
 but it is what has for us today so it's 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:17.180
 It's interesting to get away, everything is 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:20.360
 here is the infamous control that came 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.730
 with several update exits including 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.200
 Ask me, I'll go through all this with 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.950
 much calmer we do not stay 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:32.920
 calm is to see with standing again at last 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:37.850
 this is more sensitive of the button of the 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:40.700
 shoulders here they are more economical 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:43.460
 in theory and this is the control of xbox 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:47.990
 huai'an battery of it lasts a week 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:50.020
 theoretically this is the next hdmi cable 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:53.450
 along with Guarani and compatibility to 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:58.760

 I do not know how to speak Portuguese 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.760
 Only that is what John is that you have to 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.550
 have a little space in the prison while not 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:15.950

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:18.229
 Now, my dear, now it's that 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.609
