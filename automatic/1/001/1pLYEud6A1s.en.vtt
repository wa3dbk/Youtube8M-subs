00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:08.889
 talk is not that me and jim and people are the 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:13.929
 I came to bring a video next. 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:16.660
 information about a video that 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:22.840
 left a while a while ago for a 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:26.590
 possible movie is the gospel is the 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:31.660
 name is gospel the note tie and by 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:34.019
 which I've seen seems quite a teaser in the 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.019
 hour 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:39.100
 so I did not find anything about it 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.090
 no news wants to say or try 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.890
 browse right 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.690
 I only saw the video recently and it 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.969
 make a comment 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.579
 I did not see anything about it on this 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:50.800
 video wants to receive news about 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:54.250
 this video but I think it kind 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:57.039
 I think it would be part I think it would be 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:03.969
 a project of a new film in itself geai 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:06.820
 of the gospel would be like a part of a 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:09.570
 initial scene of the new toy movie 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.310
 the movie 4 that leaked on the internet 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.350
 Good if you have any more information. 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.479
 want to share can put us in 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.549
 comments because I did not take traveling 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:23.439
 in this news I saw it very fucking 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:26.500
 because I'll leave portions of the trailer 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:30.100
 You see, it's really fucking expensive, it's a lot. 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:34.869
 of the hour and I how was the gospel face 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:36.720
 almost teila had a once and nerdy face 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.600
 because the guy 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.409
 the graph is very cool so kind to 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:47.200
 a company that tests carniv animation 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:50.619
 spend an exorbitant money money 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:56.020
 do only one teaser and have nothing is 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:59.380
 A lot of stupid or not, because a 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:03.009
 effort every wheel but in kind was a 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.610
 team that made no technical specifications 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:11.230
 in this business then 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:13.090
 then okay and type ii displays in the 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.960
 train is also a very off thing 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.780
 also 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.040
 You can fit these scenes as 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.050
 an event 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.670
 after the hard is what's happening 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:26.620
 during the fourth film and understanders 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.330
 understood that what happened during 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.790
 the other three in the gospel who do not 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.150
 assisted recommended that there are many 3 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:38.650
 to 1 and current what is called rebuild bope 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:41.230
 I advise you a lot. 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:46.360
 the ancient series the ancient anime of the 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:48.730
 gospel is very good indeed kind 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.800
 end I only recommend that they accept final 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.670
 of the series saw a type from 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:57.400
 when to start getting boring end i 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:01.000
 back advice that you watch a 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:04.180
 nf gospel movie that the end of the 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.860
 series is the end of the good gift is just this 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.060
 I wanted to inform them a message 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.410
 fast 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:13.600
 remembering that tomorrow tomorrow after 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.560
 betting on this video is betting on 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.140
 gameplay 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.630
 and in that same gameplay I'll speak the 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.300
 that will happen with one that is 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.580
 happening promise of what I said one 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.250
 time ago a video ago that I was going to 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:30.070
 bring the review of the gay kit I'm still going 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.140
 bring but I'll let them know 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:36.550
 during the mp so beauty I hope that 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:38.560
 you like and stay with a trailer will 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.170
 have the train link have so much that 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.180
 There are a lot of guys in there who have a lot on a video. 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.130
 next, so I can not find a video 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.570
 whole because it's always with music 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:51.010
 covered over because I think the 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:53.740
 business of tutorials I do not know what has 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:04:00.150
 shown business is very recent 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:04:06.040
 so if it works out I will not take freg 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:08.260
 Are you listening now, then, beauty? 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.460
 vadim share and sign in 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.460
