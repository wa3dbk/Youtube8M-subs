00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:09.350
 to undo disaster 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.400
 in 2012 the third came to the market 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.580
 generation of the audi a3 a car that 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.770
 when it was launched in 1996 it occupied a niche 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.210
 of the market of the premium compact 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.369
 that until then there was no 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.540
 worried to the rest of builders and 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.540
 the idea was a success 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.760
 the range 3 has been growing over the years 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.949
 and now it's composed of variants of 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.379
 body with three doors five 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:41.899
 doors or sportback four doors or 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.850
 sedan and cabrio or cabriolet 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.190
 In addition, in normal versions, 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.879
 add the sports ones so that the 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.879
 offer is very broad 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.680
 the sedan body arrived at the market 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:02.040
 in autumn 2013 and this of greater 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:06.960
 length of the a3 range with 446 meters 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:09.440
 It is 180 meters wide and 142 meters wide 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.440
 Tall 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.540
 yes 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.610
 the next step in tamayo within 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.799
 the audi range is occupied by the a4, which is 25 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.400
 four centimeters longer and quite 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:23.400
 clearer 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.619
 to reduce the weight they are used 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.600
 light materials like aluminum in 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.280
 different elements for example in the 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.280
 bonnet and fins 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.700
 the traditional large grill 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.250
 dimensions with the top corners 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.170
 oblique and hexagonal shape dominates the 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.149
 Front headlights maintain the style of 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.259
 the brand and may include day lights 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.259
 with led technology 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.930
 under the front field is mounted on 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.659
 transverse position a turbo engine 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.909
 it could be the 2.0 tdi of four 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.709
 inline cylinders and 16 valves the 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.080
 turbocharger is variable geometry 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.459
 and is coupled to an intercooler that is 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.980
 It is responsible for cooling the compressed air 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.959
 before admission to increase your 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.300
 density and oxygen content 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.819
 necessary for efficient combustion of 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.069
 diesel the maximum power is 150 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.410
 horses that reach only 3,500 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:29.460
 revolutions per minute and they are maintained 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.770
 up to 4,000 revolutions per minute 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.470
 meanwhile the abundant torque of push 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.480
 reaches its maximum value at 1750 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.640
 revolutions per minute and it stays 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.640
 up to 3,000 revolutions per minute 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.360
 these figures indicate that it is a 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.580
 very elastic propeller capable of 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.860
 provide a nice push from 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.690
 very low regime allowing fast 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.690
 overtaking without recoveries 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.830
 the available driving force is 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.750
 moves to the front wheels by 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:12.390
 means an automatic gearbox 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.390
 double clutch s tronic with 6 gears 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.960
 with a weight of one thousand three hundred ninety and 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.640
 five kilograms the three have been 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.490
 tested can accelerate from 0 to 100 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.070
 kilometers per hour in 83 seconds and 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:30.880
 reach a maximum speed of 224 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.880
 kilometers per hour 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.840
 the average consumption approved by audi is 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:42.239
 4.4 liters per 100 kilometers and in 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.620
 our test we have measured 62 liters 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.780
 every 100 kilometers 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.890
 It is not difficult to lose 6 liters each 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.090
 100 kilometers 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.170
 but the consumptions are always 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.170
 over the approved ones 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.550
 the cabin offers capacity for 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.920
 four seats quite comfortable though 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:05.010
 the backs do not stand out because of their height 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.080
 free to the roof the rear central square 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.260
 It is narrow and uncomfortable and the windows 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.690
 backs do not go down completely in the squares 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.290
 rear air outlet adjustable 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.290
 of the conditioner 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:25.110
 the trunk volume is 425 liters 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:27.979
 so that he removes 45 liters at 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.389
 sportback and 60 liters to three doors 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:33.919
 under the floor series account with a 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:33.919
 emergency spare wheel 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.840
 Yes Yes 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.590
 the posture at the wheel that in the unit 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.140
 proven was the sports one is the option to 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.600
 with a price of 130 euros and flattened 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.250
 down is good with some seats that 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.250
 They hold the body well and a great 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.990
 support for the left foot the change 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.150
 center knicks can be operated from 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.010
 sequential manual mode with some cams 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.050
 what's on the steering wheel and it works well in 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.690
 general although sometimes it's a bit slow 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.460
 of reaction is the address has 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.230
 electrical assistance depending on the 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.180
 speed and the brakes offer a good 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:10.840
 touch and they show powerful and 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.840
 dosable 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.060

 Multibrazo back and serial is counted 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.180
 with the audi drive select that allows 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.950
 choose among several programs 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.260
 driving the test unit counted 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.750
 with the sports suspension s line that 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:35.370
 costs 405 euros and goes down in about 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.370
 millimeters the center of gravity 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.230
 the car offers a very behavioral 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.120
 dynamic and looks very flat in the curves 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:48.570
 without becoming uncomfortable for the 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.150
 occupiers stand out for their agility and for 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.590
 your test high speeds 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.040
 providing remarkable confidence to the

 to your email 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.320
 what we liked most was the 

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:00.710
 road behavior and volume 

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.710
 of the trunk 

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.010
 what we liked the least was in 

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:12.360
 the back central square and politics 

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:12.360
 of options that the brand follows
