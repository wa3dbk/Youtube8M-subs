 do it that we separate we used 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.059
 our diamond ep on this beautiful it 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.380
 so what if he is if he is not 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.320
 not complicated in europe and at the same time 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.200
 Too bad what annoys me a little 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.030
 I would not take a chance I 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.190
 would not want to take risks stupidly 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.010
 it would be really stupid used a 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.559
 joker whereas while I have all the 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.520
 ways not to knock 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.969
 that's if you did not understand me 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.809
 talk about these if I need a 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.039
 new sword quickly hop she is there 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.380
 that's good it's ok my country 

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:09.569
 was going so can go there we can go 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.979
 so maybe we'll just light up a 

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:13.560
 little because here I realize that it is 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.670
 still not glory then there by 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.679
 against there is a very interesting thing 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.359
 is that there is the fleet and that it 

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:21.779
 feel the fight very very easy since 

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:26.369
 I'll just have to push the boss into the 

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:29.279
 fleet and she burst what has 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.259
 write here you have aces and you can 

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:32.549

 at the hall swayed in the fleet and 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.909
 then after I think she can even 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:44.399
 not go back down there is not 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.789

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.560

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.590

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.090
 that you lose points of life yes you 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.630
 lose life points I have 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.040
 printing in order to leave them to 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:27.610
 the witness spirit I will go back up my 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:30.400
 hunger bar they are void they 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.630
 can not get enough of that 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.930
 me who aims more good go there 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.440

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.750
 we go back there, we'll get them out 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.430
 that's perfect perfect perfect shot 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.269
 what wrote because I know 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:46.569
 that you are a chest here I do not dream but 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.920
 you are well co there yet and then 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.130
 remote shooting is terrible 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.630
 actually they really hurt 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.910
 go we take the diamond countries is going 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.989
 try to sort it out quickly 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.269
 it should not make it pop 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.370
 new wave will try to the 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.450
 maintain that way it's perfect I can 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.430
 keep me long that there's no 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.780
 worries I hope my sword can hold 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.100
 for a long time also here 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.859
 by cons I'm not finished ouch 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.250
 that happened at the fine push 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:16.660
 in the fire I'm suspicious of her like me 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.060
 what worries me more is its wave of 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.500
 pop of monsters what worries me too 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.200
 it's my diamond sword that for the 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:28.600
 blow is going to be totally destroyed at 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:30.609
 the outcome of this fight soon reaches the 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.790
 50% the bar of hunger it's the same time 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:35.859
 I can climb something to 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.480
 able to go up my 90th end bar of 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:39.670
 someone like that you calm yourself ok 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.380
 its pop its pop and there it is very feared 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.600
 on the other hand go to the sprint we pretend 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.370
 sprint we're going to put up there up the 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.980
 that's where I think we're safe 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.980
 do not let me have peace let me have peace 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:54.329
 here come off me me what is this me here 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.329
 we will all go up the hunger bar 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:04.440
 and then we'll go back 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:04.440
 just ok let's go back 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.310
 I use my bar of iron bars 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.810
 I had to say we are not doing 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.160
 the impression that it causes him 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.040
 exactly the same damage as in 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.660
 diamond so at the limit long 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.860
 benefited to take this one is the host 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.330
 he is watching and this is the party 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.910
 slip but look he wii 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.229
 made numbers recessed accounts 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.419
 who is not you going to pass right after 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:32.979
 but this configuration where do not me 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:38.770
 do not dislike to there is finally he has 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:39.720
 obviously kabush 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.949
 cleared cleared 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.260
 here it is valdinguer in the air 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:46.780
 she has an ability that is pushing 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.389
 in the air at this one do not go 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.889
 redo a small sequence 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:52.000
 normally normally if I plate it 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:52.960
 when the wall I should be able to tuque 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.300
 quickly it's back sooner 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.840
 so I can easily do the cuvÃ©e 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.910
 do not move too much 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.860
 stay like that it's perfect she has 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.260
 surely still make a wave of pop 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.789
 of monsters what should not 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.560
 represent big difficulties then 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:09.039
 then we will be able to kill him all 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.080
 just here to use 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:12.160
 the whole of our ep in doing our 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:17.110
 ep in diamond will have taken a big 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:18.370
 also slap and then we will not forget 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.919
 to take the safe that I found 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.120
 totally by chance 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:23.740
 Come on let's go we go we go we go 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.510
 soon killed him that's good it should 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:29.889
 make 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:31.150
 ok it's perfect no does not pop is 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:33.490
 just in the end he showed 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:37.210
 stuff that's it I saw him I froze him 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:39.360
 had no worries, no worries 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.360
 rids 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.669
 this is perfect go up the bar of 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:47.229
 hungry and sees the duck victory then 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:49.479
 it's the piece of compass number 6 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:52.060
 perfect I have more than two left 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:53.159
 so find boss boss rather easy 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.479
 eh good for me 

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:56.800
 no no we're where in there because I 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:58.810
 know that you 're going to look here 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.940
 ah ah, it's disgusting to me 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.050
 to do that it's really disgusting but 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.970
 is there going to be a little diamond 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:07.210
 in the corner it would be nice to have a 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:08.440
 diamond in there suspense in Japan must 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:13.060
 can go up no must not go up 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:14.919
 by that, what are you slapping 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.330
 aces and you can acquire it heal 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:18.789
 kof but what are you kidding me 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:21.780
 you guys have aces and you can 

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:21.780
 acquire this kof 

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:25.690
 it's a joke, get away with me there's no 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.580
 nothing at all in your rotten couch 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:30.130
 regard there is nothing else 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:31.750
 secret to the old scam super the 

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:34.080
 good two ball box it does not matter 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:36.969
 go mission accomplished we managed to 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.380
 get this piece of compass he me 

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:39.460
 remains more than two of the blow we're going 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.659
 stop there the episode today 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.969
 since we have largely exceeded 

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:44.440
 our quota mission accomplished for 

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:46.120
 amazon is what we will do is we 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.310
 will then surely move towards the 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.990
 cube of bermuda and then we will end up on 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:52.060
 the ice island 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.560
 and then after then after that we 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.780
 will bring together all the pieces of compass 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.039
 direction the fatal final test of 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.690
 this season for now it's happening 

00:06:57.039 --> 00:07:01.469
 very well I hope it will continue to 

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.469
 the next hi to all
