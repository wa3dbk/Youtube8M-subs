00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.329
 or 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.760
 good evening it snowed as expected on a 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.259
 large part of the country this sunday 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.450
 fairly consistent snowfall between 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:20.759
 the center of the country and the northern regions 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.990
 this afternoon tonight at the snow is in 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:23.520
 shifting to the regions of 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.590
 northeast where freezing rain is 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.150
 fell this afternoon so the snow 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.619
 falls on icy soils be 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.420
 especially cautious at night 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.500
 next and tomorrow morning when you 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.150
 take the road besides the 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.129
 vigilance is maintained between the east of 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.839
 burgundy and alsace lorraine in 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:38.489
 going through the free county to 

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:40.170
 snowfall continue on these 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.850
 regions tonight they 'll be done 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.770
 during the night but the soil will remain 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.850
 particularly and slippery and by 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.710
 elsewhere it's not over 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.059
 a new snowy episode goes to us 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.079
 to reach through the northern quarter 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.030
 west next night 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.800
 snowfall will begin on the 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.120
 north of brittany at the end of the night and 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.859
 they will shift tomorrow morning between 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.390
 Normandy the northern countries of the 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:58.770
 north of the central region and 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.590
 the west of the Paris basin 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.629
 so again we wait between 1 and 3 cm 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.910
 locally 5 to 6 cm of fresh snow 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.570
 so be particularly careful about 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.820
 all these regions 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.229
 let's see together the forecasts for 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.460
 your monday morning we're going 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.670
 find our new disruption 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.659
 who will stretch from the Pyrenees 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.850
 to the sides of the sleeve in the 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.930
 part where you is from this last is 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.610
 well it's the snow that will fall 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.470
 down to the level of the plain so a 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.540
 snow that should flow between the 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.579
 burgundy and normandy it's mostly 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.990
 between the north of Brittany the 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:29.579
 Normandy the northern countries of the Loire 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.810
 and the center region that falls from 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.340
 snow are the most important 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.990
 with a layer of several centimeters 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.030
 which will therefore hold on the ground 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.590
 be particularly vigilant 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.119
 once in the eastern regions a 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.530
 drier and variable weather with still 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.460
 some flakes near the borders of 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.930
 north and north-east 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.670
 and then a time also drier but 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.990
 very windy for the basin of the 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.460
 Mediterranean also notes that the wind 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.299
 will blow very significantly on the 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.310
 Atlantic coast 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.899
 in the afternoon the disturbance is going 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.219
 slowly progressed to the regions of 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.360
 north and east it will concern the 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:56.549
 two-thirds of the territory 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.049
 if the reasons for benelux and the sector 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.579
 extending between the Lyon region and 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.229
 the Mediterranean basin should remain 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.329
 dry anywhere else will require 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.009
 rely on rainfall under 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.750
 rainy form between Brittany and the 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.269
 pyrenees but often in form 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.079
 snowy going towards normandy 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.579
 probably the northern countries of the 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:12.900
 north of the central region for 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:14.880
 probably also on the basin 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.169
 Parisian with several centimeters of 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.019
 snow to fall so on all these 

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:21.060
 regions between 1 and 3 cm on average but 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.480
 locally we can go up to 5 to 6 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.709
 cents 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.760
 this will be the case in particular 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.739
 Norman hills so be 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.780
 particularly cautious between the north 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.190
 from the island of france picardie la 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.260
 champagne lorraine there it will rather 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.640
 generally light snowfall 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.190
 and that will certainly arrive in class 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.019
 evening temperatures for your 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.220
 Monday morning they stay 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.690
 winter on two thirds of the 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.040
 territory still unfreeze on the 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.780
 northern and eastern regions minus 4 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.340
 degrees for the minimum to Lille hamon 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.500
 wants him more degrees to the reverse side 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.239
 from the basque country -1 degree to paris 0 degree 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.680
 to reindeer and then in the afternoon they 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.150
 stand in values â€‹â€‹that 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.400
 are below the normal of season 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.200
 in the northern two-thirds of the territory 0 Â° 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.030
 no more on the benelux we will climb 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.470
 still between 11 and 14 degrees on the 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.549
 basin of the Mediterranean and you 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.260
 see no more than one degree in the 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.269
 capital 2 degrees to strasbourg 3 degrees 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.109
 at cherbourg 4 for reindeer at five to 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.540
 nantes or 6 degrees in lyon and the 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.440
 next she is not really anymore 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.160
 encouraging since we are going to have 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.019
 the arrival of a new disturbance 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.849
 for the day of Tuesday she goes 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.230
 to extend from Aquitaine 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.549
 going back to the northern agents 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.410
 again when the latter 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.579
 will meet the cold art one could 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.150
 have some snow or snow 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.829
 melting 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.840
 in the northernmost regions there is 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:25.980
 will obviously come back tomorrow night to 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.180
 the back a trolling sky is going 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.230
 to settle in the regions of the quarter 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.030
 north west and then drier weather 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.169
 still expected on the regions 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.169
 from the east with all the same 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:35.400
 temperatures that will remain low 

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:36.900
 wednesday now so you see that 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.849
 the map with always a winter weather 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.380
 on most regions can be 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:41.849
 still some residual flakes on 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.650
 the regions of the far north same thing 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:45.060
 in the center-east enough rains 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.470
 supported between the Riviera and the 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.049
 Corsican with snow on the Alps of the 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.340
 south from 600 meters and over 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:52.349
 more also that will flow between 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.700
 brittany and aquitaine no 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:54.780
 slippery phenomena this time with 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.340
 so temperatures that will be 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.930
 positive but generally speaking 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.819
 covers note that temperatures are going 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.139
 stay below the normal of season 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.079
 this will be especially the case in the regions 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:05.549
 of the northern half and the eastern half 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:06.810
 Thursday and Friday the trend remains 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.340
 winter temperatures are going even 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.870
 go back down so that the 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.430
 thaw will again be very difficult 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.870
 in the northern and eastern regions 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.160
 rainy Thursday so south of the 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.870
 everywhere else a time rather 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.000
 dry with maybe a few flakes here 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.289
 and there a time also brighter 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.479
 on the north-east quarter regions but 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:23.190
 again we will have temperatures that 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:25.050
 will be well base Friday a gray weather 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.820
 on most regions but a priori 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.180
 no rush can be a few 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.680
 flakes 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.969
 here and there to the level of the plains 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.020
 but not large quantities a time 

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:32.310
 brighter anyway between the 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.260
 Pyrenees lion and the Gulf 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.640
 temperatures that will be at the lowest 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.650
 finally the next weekend that could 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.300
 be marked by a more frank redoux 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.040
 with the arrival of a Saturday disturbance 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.900
 by Brittany that could reach 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.850
 cross the whole country Sunday 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.900
 so with a return to the key and again 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.130
 once when the latter has 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.680
 met their franc could fear 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.570
 a new freezing or snowy episode 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.860
 obviously we need to specify rats this to the 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.510
 approach of the deadline but we do not have 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.890
 not yet finished with winter and so 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.930
 the coming week will be another 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.200
 times is cold and winter on 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.640
 most French regions 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.140
 so this is a reminder 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.610
 vigilance is maintained on the 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.680
 northeastern quarter regions until tomorrow 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.960
 morning because of slippery phenomena it 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.590
 will snow under icy soils on 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.880
 all these regions 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.080
 and then new snowfall 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.310
 are expected from the end of 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.600
 night on the north of brittany they are 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.580
 will then shift to the hills 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.050
 Normandy and the north of the central region 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.300
 to then reach the west of the basin 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.770
 Parisian in the morning so be 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.690
 careful several inches of snow 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.090
 are expected on all these regions 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.890
 tomorrow we will know Monday, January 21st 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.040
 you will celebrate the agnes the sun will be 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.210
 get up at 8:33 and go to bed at 5:30 pm 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.750
 tidal coefficients as for them are 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.460
 at the lowest 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.540
 I will find you with pleasure tomorrow 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.440
 evening 10 and the addition wishes a 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.420
 excellent evening 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.860
 again be very careful if 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.860
 you take the road good evening
