00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.139
 olano simple welcome one more day to 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.480
 my channel this time I bring you a 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.410
 video a bit different because it's about 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.970
 of a bouquet 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.250
 as you know now it is very fashionable 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:28.720
 between the Spanish blocks and in addition 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:31.680
 many make videos of these book tags and 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:35.200
 good is something that I think is fantastic 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.790
 because I have always seen them in 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.620
 English blogs from the United States 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:43.870
 etcetera and I was wondering why not here 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.300
 these things happened it is true that many 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.839
 Sometimes I have thought to bring some in Spanish 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.840
 but good or for lack of time or for 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:55.149
 laziness or because you do not know how to do it in 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.030
 reality and gives you a little there for the 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:59.680
 end never makes them want anything after 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.780
 from this roll I'm going to take a computer 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.879
 of the temporary and that I need 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.729
 if you see any real change or framing 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.410
 of camera of it is that good not only 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.020

 a video the tag that I bring you today 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.660
 called search for the lost book that is 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.149

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.649
 of the blog fuego de nieve the book taco 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.350
 original I will not say the name because 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:27.400
 It's a bit weird and I do not want to laugh 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:31.150
 this original book tag was created by 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.470
 the library of sarah and well then to 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.780
 final has come up 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.460
 the chaquito basically what it deals with is 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.620
 that give you a series of guidelines and you 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:43.730
 you have to find books that meet 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:46.490
 those guidelines or conditions we started to 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.670
 see the first condition is find a 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.410

 I guess this is a key does not have 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.620
 that interest a law but 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.960
 Find something on your shelf that does not 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.960
 be a book with books 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.580

 problem 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.209

 the book that has only words is that 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.939
 this is a little weird because all the 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.569
 books have words memories of a 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:33.000

 this a little but good has drawings 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:50.190
 an airplane finds a book with letters 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.190

 so I think the only newspaper that I have 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.700
 this is anna frank's diary 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.740

 some will have but 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.520
 Well, I'll have to repeat an author 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:27.510
 who has already named Galician laura 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.340
 García Laura and Garcia are a name and a 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.870
 respectively very common 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.270
 Find a book that has a first 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.110
 plane of something on its cover 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:39.090
 that there is none of that 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.939
 efe then I'll say it's a megan novel 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.069
 Maxwell who gets a girl like that in 

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:47.629
 close-up with her finds a book 

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:47.629
 that is set in an ancient era 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.210
 the heretic of miguel delibes encounter

 are these books that I like very much with 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:11.340
 more than 12 or 13 years I saw it as five 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:13.860
 times in a year and well I love me 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.880
 I loved I do not know now what opinion will 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.860
 of the 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.680
 but I do not have much affection for this 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.800
 book finds a tour book that is 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.210
 pride and prejudice of jane austen that 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.800
 is the only place that yes since I have 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.930
 here I find the book you have 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.480
 stars so close and finally 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.400
 I find book that is not game and in 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.690
 instead of teaching your adult book that 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.450
 then that will be what you are waiting for 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.820
 I'm going to teach you a children's book 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:41.520
 ebook a whole year 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:43.500
 from arnold lobel that this book that I 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.500
 they sent when I was little and in fact 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.600
 since six years and I like them a lot and 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.670
 in fact then how we liked the book to 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.110
 everyone sent us is you stay 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:55.260
 here you can separable is that your 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:57.120
 second part or good I do not know if they go which 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.380
 goes first which the second in 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.570
 reality 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.760
 but well I remember it with a lot 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:05.190
 love of my childhood and we were already 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.720
 finished the tag as you see also 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:10.800
 I wanted to make it a little dynamic like 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:12.120
 did the classroom but logically already after 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.130
 of having seen some questions already 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.780
 she had and was no longer a book 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.790
 I prepared but I thought as 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.520
 physio because raised several times already to 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:22.580
 pick up books but well I hope that you 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.580
 like 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:27.440
 that feels light because good 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.090
 lifted up and made a splendid sun and 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.030
 I say I will record the work that there is not 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:34.090
 nobody is sun 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:36.340
 and it's nullifying and shit that we 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:38.110
 we see soon it is surely serious 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.030
 also some for the month of January already 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.410
 I'm so good to upload two videos 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:44.770
 those that I come out with the most clothes in the 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:46.600
 mast removed as evidently is for 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:49.300
 I do not expect you to have enjoyed that 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.730
 and I hope more people will be encouraged to do 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.660
 these tags on all is a video 

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:55.360
 because I think they are much more 

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.920
 fun like that before anything else 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.100
 tell you that good never respond to 

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:02.080
 your comments or rarely 

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:03.620
 Excuse me, I really read them all or 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.150
 at least 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.040
 I think I read them all but surely 

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:09.080
 some escape to me because many good 

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:11.960
 notifications I receive them by hotmail 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:14.860
 but after not twitter many times 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:16.840
 I forgot to look at it 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.789
 what connects then does not stretch 

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.729
 someone has named me more retweeted 

00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:24.069
 forgive me anyway for 

00:07:21.729 --> 00:07:26.789
 twitter is more active and there yes that 

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:28.719
 I usually respond faster so good 

00:07:26.789 --> 00:07:31.840
 thank you very much for all of you 

00:07:28.719 --> 00:07:33.759
 Real comments that I read them and 

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.740
 I appreciate them very much and if I see that I need 

00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:37.479
 answer that I do not answer is worth but 

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.430
 I do not have as much general lines 

00:07:37.479 --> 00:07:43.719
 time to walk responding to all 

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:47.460
 the messages and everything so nothing 

00:07:43.719 --> 00:07:47.460
 we see in the next video a little kiss
