 it's not a beach this is a pool like 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.590
 the ones you see or the ones that do not have 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.690
 nothing to envy to the beaches of 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.860
 our coastline is an alternative for 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.260
 all those people who obviously 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.260
 they are far away 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.549
 the beaches both south of the north and 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.780

00:05:26.869 --> 00:05:33.729
 this oppressive heat invites the public to 

00:05:29.269 --> 00:05:33.729
