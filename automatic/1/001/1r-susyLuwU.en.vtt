00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.350 
your dolls or doll on vacation with you
I<00:00:49.039> don't<00:00:50.039> mean<00:00:50.340> like<00:00:50.489> if<00:00:50.670> you're<00:00:50.820> camping

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
I don't mean like if you're camping

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.060 
I don't mean like if you're camping
because<00:00:51.629> if<00:00:52.140> you're<00:00:52.320> camping<00:00:52.739> you're<00:00:52.890> going

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
because if you're camping you're going

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.770 
because if you're camping you're going
to<00:00:53.250> get<00:00:53.399> dirty<00:00:53.820> or<00:00:54.780> broken<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:56.480> you're<00:00:57.480> not

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
to get dirty or broken and you're not

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.240 
to get dirty or broken and you're not
really<00:00:57.960> going<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.260> play<00:00:58.530> with<00:00:58.859> them<00:00:59.070> because

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
really going to play with them because

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.279 
really going to play with them because
usually<00:00:59.910> when<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.329> go<00:01:00.449> camping<00:01:00.629> you're<00:01:01.109> busy

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
usually when you go camping you're busy

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.830 
usually when you go camping you're busy
doing<00:01:01.620> other<00:01:01.770> things<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:03.049> taking<00:01:04.049> hikes<00:01:04.530> and
