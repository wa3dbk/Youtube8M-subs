00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.929
 and today I bring you what I promised you 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.070
 last week what you expected with 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:17.099
 you crave the second edition of the acca ncap 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.710
 that for those who do not know is a 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:22.169
 the League of Legends tournament this 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.919
 time it will be on the map the crack of the 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:28.229
 invoker of 5 against 5 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:30.749
 well followed by this I will explain 

00:00:28.229 --> 00:00:34.140
 the bases and the rules that the 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:38.309
 tournament in the tournament will participate a 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:42.179
 maximum of 16 teams which should 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:46.589
 be formed by at least 5 

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:49.170
 people plus a joker is to say the 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:51.870
 wildcard is in case any of 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.100
 the five people fail to put that 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:01:00.359
 person and so be five instead of four 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:05.309
 Each team can place a maximum of three 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:08.369
 wildcards that is five more people 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.430
 three others who sign up in case they 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.920
 someone is missing and they need someone else 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.229
 to play 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.259
 also say that if at the time of 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:20.420
 party to a team has failed people 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.360
 minimum of players to play a 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.700
