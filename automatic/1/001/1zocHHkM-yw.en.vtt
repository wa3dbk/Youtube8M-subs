00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:05.970
 hey people maybe turn on 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.890
 Welcome to this video 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.780
 Today we want that samsung 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.490
 only look at the archive better 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.740
 said the processing the design 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.870
 view there are any positives 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.139
 or negative things that are mentioned 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.720
 should 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.700
 We start with the front side look 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.990
 So let's start with the design 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.090
 processing etc 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.680
 the next thing we look at is 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.690
 the bottom because there we have two 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.330
 capacitive keys and in the middle one 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.070
 fresh design really very very good 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.289
 pressure point and reacts very well 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.539
 you see, maybe it's a little bit 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:38.280
 piece on the edge out and you feel it 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:38.749
 even if you do not look very much 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.920
 Well 

00:00:38.749 --> 00:00:42.420
 otherwise you might still have to 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.760
 watch that they have their own little ones 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.949
 color has and also like the whole 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.449
 Housing this clear and look 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:50.670
 you know the design a bit 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.949
 already from samsung galaxy s3 or the 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.289
 note 2 here too it will at least be up 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.999
 the front left out why 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.789
 the case we see this silver 

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:01.710
 frame on the side of course 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.870
 goes on and on the back in 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.350
 this syllable, however, ends the same 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.240
 more 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.490
 is there anything you notice? 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.220
 when we move over the frame 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.290
 everything very smooth feels very nice 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.440
 however, we have below here you can see 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.840
 that's how a third of a millimeter I became 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.270
 could collect dust that could be 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.250
 be stupid times when the housing around 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.560
 we see a small gap everywhere 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.970
 if there is any accumulation I know it 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.010
 but could not be 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.600
 Now we are on the top and what 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.460
 Of course you can see it here again 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.500
 the frame and the earpiece this 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.780
 is also, I believe such a 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.230
 millimeter out and here too 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.210
 could collect dust well but needs 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.410
 not and here you can see the again 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.410
 silver frame around the 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.120
 complete housing draws apropos today 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.560
 chance the side and what we here 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:54.390
 Of course, the volume is noticeable 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.880
 seesaw shakes it very very minimal 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.830
 You can tell that they are very light 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.930
 headroom has particularly large but it is 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.120
 not the low point is very soft 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.910
 Nevertheless, it is very good if you are me 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.360
 asks further we go here we see 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.859
 nothing on the bottom we see the 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.420
 micro-usb connection there is not 

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:13.300
 much to say he is open there 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.120
 Nothing 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.470
 what that is covered but now too 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.170
 no waterproof mobile phone where you can get that 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.430
 might need more there is to 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.230
 not really to say 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.450
 let's change on this side we have 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.190
 the camera button is also available 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.180
 a bit more than a piece out 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.070
 the power button 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.870
 That's because it's two-tiered 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.700
 Press once to the camera 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.510
 Focus to press once more 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.890
 trigger 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:41.620
 Here, too, we'll take a closer look 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.030
 you knew what or not you see 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.210
 a bit of a jiggle and you have it 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.960
 of course a bit of a game outside 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:51.430
 as you would with a power button 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.650
 but this one has a little play, too 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.220
 wonderful pressure point works so well 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.960
 as it should be in 3.5 millimeters 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.640
 you do not have to jack connection now 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.410
 Great talk there is nothing 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.480
 what you could say he is not 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.260
 He honestly hides it where it is 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.390
 should lie 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.580
 So let's go back and over 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.920
 I personally like them very much 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.900
 good not only because of this industry - 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.610
 style what we said but others 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.410
 already know each other but because we are so 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.420
 we put a little accent 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.070
 I take it down the chrome frame 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.900
 Of course, this time it's all plastic 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.270
 unfortunately this is still down here 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.400
 covers and thus a small yes me 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.540
 say a child gives up to the device 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.610
 generally speaking and we have this 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.750
 broad speakers, however 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.160
 maybe you can see that when you are 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.530
 accurate hinguckt now you can see that 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.150
 only here really is that 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.020
 that simply means a design element 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.750
 just like this backside one can 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.980
 to really melt on the tongue 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.140
 Melt it looks nice here 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.700
 the samsung lettering you can yes 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.470
 So good is not on it 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.370
 printed on it but not calibrated 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.350
 sticks or something 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.630
 and then we come to the camera included 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.600
 lightning, of course, this is one 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.709
 Pieces out now you can see it all 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.540
 Well it is a millimeter 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.160
 but you can tell that when you look at the 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.450
 back then it wobbles 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.560
 very little bit 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:12.940
 if we do it all up 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:15.120
 we have this flop here alone 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.440
 can draw look at 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.560
 the back one knows that from samsung 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.320
 would the ammersee really and therefore 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.470
 I should also say stable now 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.720
 say stable 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.000
 Here we have the access to the battery for 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.770
 micro sd and to the micro sim card we what 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.060
 Of course you can get stuck here and 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.940
 Now we see the camera again 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.530
 completely natural here we see 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.910
 I have to screw some screws here 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.620
 not much to say here you can see that 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.480
 speaker again as he in the 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.430
 so small size is really like him 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:47.240
 is put on those hooks the 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:52.190
 backward ones then go with them once 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.540
 love over it all works so knaps 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.670
 out everything and now you see 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.960
 Maybe it is not here 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.240
 Great countries are where 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.570
 could sell something if it were 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.490
 right in it is like sitting now 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.160
 Bombproof does not slip 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.210
 Out of the way, somehow 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.550
 because you have to really his finger clean 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.470
 and well what we already have to design 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.150
 have a complete plastic housing 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.310
 even if it is a little metal country 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.960
 It looks like it does not matter naturally 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.360
 the led for that the device 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.940
 is relatively easy with 135 degrees and 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.340
 Generally it has a good hand size 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.890
 I 'll tell you if you have big hands 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.360
 has it like I already like it very much 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.560
 good with smaller hands with one 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.780
 maybe the second hand to help 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.490
 and band works is better 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.110
 Well that should have been there in any case 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.390
 how did you look at the details 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.070
 processing and so on that was that 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:43.390
 samsung has the design and the 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.390
 Processing thanks to his time
