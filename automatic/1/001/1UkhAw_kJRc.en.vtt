 has only two holes in the wood 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.660
 usually on guitar points of this 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.700
 Like you have four holes that means 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.660
 you have much more time than in 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.370
 normal guitars 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.379
 besides the material of which it is made 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.929
 in aluminum that provides a lot of 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:43.089
 the more you have in the sound you will play 

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:44.620
 Another interesting thing we have is 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:48.519

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.620
