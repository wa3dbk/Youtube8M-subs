most<00:01:00.170> of<00:01:00.260> the<00:01:00.379> developers<00:01:00.770> don't<00:01:00.920> like<00:01:01.129> it<00:01:01.309> I

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
most of the developers don't like it I

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.310 
most of the developers don't like it I
hope<00:01:01.699> that<00:01:01.910> we<00:01:02.059> will<00:01:02.090> undo<00:01:02.780> that<00:01:04.840> okay<00:01:05.840> if<00:01:06.080> you

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
hope that we will undo that okay if you

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.679 
hope that we will undo that okay if you
swipe<00:01:06.799> up<00:01:06.830> you<00:01:07.369> can<00:01:07.549> see<00:01:07.729> the<00:01:07.909> date<00:01:08.119> in<00:01:08.330> caramel

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
swipe up you can see the date in caramel

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:10.210

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
starting the device so which is very

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.460 
starting the device so which is very
irritating<00:02:23.290> and<00:02:23.640> especially<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:26.080> bug<00:02:26.290> which

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
irritating and especially the bug which

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.080 
irritating and especially the bug which
I've<00:02:26.970> seen<00:02:29.280> while<00:02:30.280> you<00:02:30.430> are<00:02:30.520> using<00:02:30.640> an<00:02:30.940> app

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
I've seen while you are using an app

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.080 
I've seen while you are using an app
like<00:02:31.930> I'm<00:02:32.410> using<00:02:32.709> the<00:02:32.860> weather<00:02:33.010> app<00:02:33.250> and<00:02:33.550> if

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
like I'm using the weather app and if

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.630 
like I'm using the weather app and if
you<00:02:34.209> minimize<00:02:34.510> it<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:35.650> content<00:02:36.069> may<00:02:36.580> be

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
you minimize it the content may be

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.170 
you minimize it the content may be
distorted<00:02:37.120> like<00:02:37.480> this<00:02:38.190> so<00:02:39.190> it<00:02:39.640> will<00:02:39.819> be<00:02:39.970> fixed

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
distorted like this so it will be fixed

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.420 
distorted like this so it will be fixed
in<00:02:40.330> the<00:02:40.480> original<00:02:41.440> issue<00:02:41.590> but<00:02:41.860> in<00:02:42.130> the<00:02:42.220> beta
