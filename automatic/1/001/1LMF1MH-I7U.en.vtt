00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.120
 interesting fact in the description of the skill 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.070
 said the spell can be applied on 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.110
 enemies driven by deezer 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.660
 communities but in reality during the action 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.370
 deezer communities that can not be the most 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.270
 common bunch is peace on 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.970
 pluses yes have Dima

 tasks wounds get warmed eron then 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.470
 there is an arrow at the moment when the action 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.090
 diffraction will end preferably 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.190
 will release the secret and roll with the most 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.380
 long distance so time 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.810
 the stun and damage the target was 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.910
 more advise you to collect force staff 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.400
 for greater mobility or for greater 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.070
 probabilities with and his allies for example

 can hide 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.400
 puja and push out for allied staff 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.830
 so that he did not receive damage from the mouth also 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.500
 a good acquisition will be show you guar 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.900

 armor and has excellent slowing 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.520
 active ability to do this is not a sinner 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.890
 Add this artifact as street scepter 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:04.570
 with which you can force yourself 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:06.940
 or for control of an enemy but as Shadow 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:13.239
 the demon looked in the first dota and called him 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:16.150
 and sobbed the most remarkable language of 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:19.000
 all start your spoken language 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:22.690
 the demon on it say the shadow demon the doom

 Shadow Finn He is rich in sounds Well he still 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.229
 relatively simple 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.300
 and the words in it have many meanings 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:31.000
 most often this language uses shadow 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.430
 daemon in second place shadow find on 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.560
 the third doom that uses it to 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.690
 talk with fellow demons Shadow 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.240
 the demon has a huge dislike for 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.770
 thought and shadow hindu because nevermore 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.169

 combined their most powerful spells 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.850
 to destroy the cult 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.920
 the creation of which shadow demon 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.530
 spent a century like these cues 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:05:02.610
 can be heard from demon shadow I thought 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:08.790

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:15.960
