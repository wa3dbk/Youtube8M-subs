00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.960
 poker friends a greeting from Alberto 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.860
 granda beautifull Russian well-found ad hoc 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.080
 online poker show 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.150
 also this week we talk about 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.629
 sunday special for accuracy e 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.460
 that of April 21st that he collected 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:41.879
 2077 players unique in the money of 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.650
 team april paolo fabretti the legendary pier 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.110
 paolo fabretti as you are used to 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.670
 to hear him named during the european 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.850
 poker tour 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.949
 here it is the 50,000 payout before 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.210
 coin and this is the chipcount commanded 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.890
 by mister ciak 19 0 89 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.460
 then as always we go goodbye 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.070
 all final table eliminations a 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.810
 starting from the ninth classified for the 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.690
 which we must not wait long 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.940
 in fact, as we can see, four are enough 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:17.280
 hands to watch the first 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:19.710
 elimination fold everyone and get to 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.110
 button pop music which is the shortest 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.860
 of all and decides to risk it all 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.929
 for everything with jack 9 but there's salmon 81 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.910
 in the big blind with ace 7 he didn't see 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:30.720
 it's time to do everything smoothly with the flop 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:36.929
 irregular 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:38.550
 it takes a jack or a 9 but I take off and give 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.039
 and her imerys un 6 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.830
 so few music started the short e 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:44.160
 after four hands he immediately returns to 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.250
 home 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:50.160
 however there are 3 thousand euros for his 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.619
 let's call it a consolation prize 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.910
 we continue in 8 while a rhythm of 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.729
 pressing game and relegates fortebracci 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:01.679
 to the last position in terms of stack 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.720
 in fact it started as early as eighth then then 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:08.849
 after the elimination of their music is 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:12.180
 remained there has really little 296,000 more o 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:16.069
 minus and everything is played at all 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:19.050
 this 70 30 against still salmon 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:23.160
 then we need a runner runner nothing 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.720
 only the soap k remains 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.730
 would deliver the two pair with the 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.670
 better kicker but then a name comes 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.970
 fortebracci 4,800 euros for ours 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.970
 player 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.440
 another round another race we get the hand 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.130
 the number 24 and is atypical this time to 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.320
 go all in 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:50.170
 he puts them all inside with ace woman 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.820
 queen of 66 will be the queen of hearts 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.030
 I really know that I don't 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:58.270
 the letters of Reggio Calabria were enough 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.940
 glue and it does clearly seen that a 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:04.870
 ace ace and in addition a nice flop arrives 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:07.440
 that also takes away the thought of one 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.440
 woman of hearts 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.450
 everything smooth and regular is atypical there 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.510
 leaves in seventh player position of 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.100
 wedge with the same parts of alessio 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.740
 isaiah great other player 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:24.850
 atypical in the money and also in the tq 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:31.209
 Event 20 will remain in six people but not 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:33.390
 number 45 and we have locos 78 which goes all 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.890
 in 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.440
 he puts them all after she was there 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.930
 the opening of some decides to defend 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:45.100
 his big blind with ace ten dominated 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:47.010
 however from the asana of some a locus 78 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:52.600
 who had also won the sunday evening 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:55.000
 last year is here and the kun moves to 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.430
 home another piece of loot that 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:04.320
 greatly strengthens its role as 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:07.560
 chip leader and leads to almost 4 million 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:10.480
 stayed in five and the final table 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.370
 he continues say let's radicalize a little 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.220
 Stack differences in bringing 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:19.959
 first three temporary positions and the kun 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:24.080
 mister ciak queen of salmon 81 and no 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:28.520
 name to 855 softer tones 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:31.729
 and there is the all in name no. 855 in 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.849
 flip against salmon 81 that just one 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:40.550
 clash between the poor we say clash that 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:43.280
 but in the end salmon wins 81 us but 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.650
 leaves us in which it is not sorry us 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:50.300
 leaves fifth player position 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:52.310
 9.450 group differences for him however 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.620
 how easy it was to imagine the trio 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.469
 of head it takes off still in the 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.210
 course of the game and salmon 81 remains at 

00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:03.229
 post and decides to put everything inside 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:05.210
 with ace 6, the kun takes care of himself 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:09.469
 the trouble to do with and to do too 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:20.419
 full to tar our greeting at 81 is the 

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:22.219
 wind at remaining three takes the deal e 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:24.379
 the comparison of the last three survivors 

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:26.840
 at the beginning he sees the kun in his head 

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:29.509
 winner also of mini need for speed 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.300
 of 15 May 2012 but the situation is 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:35.419
 fore and here in hand number 129 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:39.740
 in fact the chipleader is queen dic 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:42.289
 66 while the show is just the kun 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.029
 and here we are in a fight at the last 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:47.089
 coin flip between the two 

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:49.639
 todd os 7 and then reggina dic 

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:52.569
 it eliminates and the kun that however in virtue of the 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:55.009
 deal takes home a slice 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:57.669
 29,500 euros 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:06:01.729
 and we are at the zap the moment of truth 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:04.159
 where reggina enjoys descent mind of a 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:07.930
 clear advantage over the coach 

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:11.680
 ciak you end here at hand number 134 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:14.629
 where is this clash in coin flip 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.180
 comes the topper insult to mister shock 

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:18.770
 because there is also the bottom set for 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.910
 reggina dic 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:26.629
 drawing of our mister chuck will have to 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:30.169
 be satisfied with the 29,500 euros that 

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:35.300
 arrive by virtue of the deal we go to 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:38.539
 hear him say hello and play up 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:42.229
 PokerStars with thin and research at 19 

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:44.569
 0 89 I just left the tournament is 

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:47.960
 been a little hard towards the last coin 

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:49.699
 however the same is fine and in any case the 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.530
 most important result I did 

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:53.419
 in my short poker career 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:56.120
 since the game for just a year 

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:58.550
 I am a student and therefore my own 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:01.220
 hobby maybe we hope it will become 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:03.080
 something more over time for now goes 

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.509
 well as part of this win 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.190
 I think he considered a good ten collapse 

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:09.409
 to play online 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:11.960
 and then with once I wanted to dedicate myself a 

00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:15.080
 little live tournaments and experience below 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:16.849
 this view remained in 18 

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.919
 found a little less difficulty maybe 

00:07:16.849 --> 00:07:21.620
 because we cp lite for so I could 

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:23.659
 to attack they played very closed 

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.509
 no one hindered perna table 

00:07:23.659 --> 00:07:28.250
 final then took some fish 

00:07:25.509 --> 00:07:31.039
 someone who gave a little thread from 

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:32.690
 twist and then it was taken to china 

00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:35.389
 when they are but always a nice amount 

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:36.529
 of chips put online count in 

00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:38.569

 while the first classified will be the one 

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.870
 that 33 will have gained less than 27,900 

00:07:48.919 --> 00:07:52.639
 euro but it will also be the only one that can 

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:54.279
 say to have brought home a nice one
