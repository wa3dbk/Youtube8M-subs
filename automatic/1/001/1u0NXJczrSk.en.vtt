00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
John say it would be a little hard to

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.159 
John say it would be a little hard to
walk<00:03:21.730> in<00:03:21.790> and<00:03:22.299> to<00:03:22.389> reach<00:03:22.569> things<00:03:22.840> and<00:03:22.959> anything

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.509 
we're going to put a raised bed right in
the<00:03:28.930> middle<00:03:29.109> here<00:03:29.199> so<00:03:29.560> both<00:03:29.799> of<00:03:29.829> these<00:03:30.129> trees

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
the middle here so both of these trees

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.250 
the middle here so both of these trees
are<00:03:30.549> going<00:03:30.909> to<00:03:30.970> be<00:03:31.030> in<00:03:31.269> the<00:03:31.479> raised<00:03:31.659> bed<00:03:31.959> and
