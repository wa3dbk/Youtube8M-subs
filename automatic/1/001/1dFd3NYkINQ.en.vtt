these<00:00:01.500> are<00:00:01.680> my<00:00:01.829> kilns<00:00:02.429> this<00:00:02.760> kiln<00:00:03.120> is<00:00:03.449> a<00:00:03.480> really

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
these are my kilns this kiln is a really

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.019 
these are my kilns this kiln is a really
huge<00:00:04.170> one<00:00:04.529> and<00:00:04.830> because<00:00:05.400> my<00:00:05.640> work<00:00:05.819> is<00:00:06.000> so

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
huge one and because my work is so

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.049 
huge one and because my work is so
little<00:00:06.569> I<00:00:06.779> don't<00:00:07.259> fire<00:00:07.620> it<00:00:07.649> this<00:00:08.130> one<00:00:08.370> fires<00:00:08.670> on

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
little I don't fire it this one fires on

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.020 
little I don't fire it this one fires on
220<00:00:09.349> but<00:00:10.349> this<00:00:10.530> is<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:10.740> small<00:00:10.980> electric<00:00:11.759> kiln

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
220 but this is a small electric kiln

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.580 
220 but this is a small electric kiln
that<00:00:12.179> actually<00:00:12.750> fires<00:00:13.019> on<00:00:13.349> household<00:00:14.340> current

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:15.590 
that actually fires on household current

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.170 
that actually fires on household current
the<00:00:16.590> way<00:00:16.740> that<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.100> kiln<00:00:17.490> works

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
the way that a kiln works

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.630 
the way that a kiln works
is<00:00:18.240> that<00:00:20.480> it<00:00:21.740> porcelain<00:00:22.740> fires<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.609> a

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
is that it porcelain fires to a

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.230 
is that it porcelain fires to a
temperature<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:24.300> cone<00:00:24.750> 6<00:00:25.230> which<00:00:25.560> is<00:00:25.590> around

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
temperature of cone 6 which is around

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.380 
temperature of cone 6 which is around
2,600<00:00:27.240> degrees<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:28.980> use<00:00:29.730> one<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.090> these

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
2,600 degrees so I use one of these

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.630 
2,600 degrees so I use one of these
little<00:00:30.920> bars<00:00:32.030> which<00:00:33.030> is<00:00:33.180> called<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.570> cone<00:00:33.870> and

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
little bars which is called a cone and

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.069 
little bars which is called a cone and
when<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.850> gets<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.480> proper<00:00:36.630> temperature

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.270 

this<00:00:40.079> little<00:00:40.620> bar<00:00:41.030> inside<00:00:42.030> will<00:00:42.510> melt<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:43.280> put

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
this little bar inside will melt I put

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:51.920 
this little bar inside will melt I put
it<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:45.030> put<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.420> cone<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:46.219> like<00:00:47.219> this<00:00:50.930> holder

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
it in I put the cone in like this holder

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.819 
it in I put the cone in like this holder
and<00:00:52.340> this<00:00:53.340> little<00:00:53.699> switch<00:00:54.260> goes<00:00:55.260> back<00:00:55.590> and

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
and this little switch goes back and

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.139 
and this little switch goes back and
forth<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.399> when<00:00:56.730> this<00:00:57.530> melts<00:00:58.789> it'll<00:00:59.789> then

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
forth and when this melts it'll then

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.130 
forth and when this melts it'll then
trigger<00:01:00.539> this<00:01:00.899> latch<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:02.280> go<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:03.359> go<00:01:03.510> down<00:01:03.809> and

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
trigger this latch to go to go down and

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.800 
trigger this latch to go to go down and
turn<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.920> kiln<00:01:05.220> off<00:01:05.430> automatically<00:01:06.180> account

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
turn the kiln off automatically account

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.250 
turn the kiln off automatically account
I<00:01:07.080> put<00:01:07.500> my<00:01:08.100> porcelain<00:01:08.670> in<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.689> turn<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.170> on

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
I put my porcelain in and I turn it on

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.670 
I put my porcelain in and I turn it on
low<00:01:10.560> for<00:01:10.590> about<00:01:11.010> an<00:01:11.369> hour<00:01:12.020> with<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.530> is

asbestos like material
the<00:02:15.400> shoulder<00:02:15.880> plate<00:02:16.210> I<00:02:16.420> have<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:17.020> profit

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
the shoulder plate I have the profit

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.640 
the shoulder plate I have the profit
stuffed<00:02:17.950> inside<00:02:18.220> because<00:02:19.000> if<00:02:19.330> I<00:02:19.960> just<00:02:19.990> had<00:02:20.500> it

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
stuffed inside because if I just had it

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.670 
stuffed inside because if I just had it
in<00:02:20.770> the<00:02:20.920> kiln<00:02:21.220> like<00:02:21.430> this<00:02:21.960> when<00:02:22.960> it<00:02:23.080> gets<00:02:23.320> hot

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
in the kiln like this when it gets hot

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.570 
in the kiln like this when it gets hot
it<00:02:24.010> it<00:02:24.250> would<00:02:24.880> tend<00:02:25.240> to<00:02:25.590> want<00:02:26.590> to<00:02:26.680> close<00:02:27.100> down

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
it it would tend to want to close down

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.970 
it it would tend to want to close down
and<00:02:28.030> break<00:02:28.870> at<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.320> shoulders<00:02:29.890> so<00:02:30.190> I<00:02:30.270> put<00:02:31.270> this

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
and break at the shoulders so I put this

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.870 
and break at the shoulders so I put this
cottony<00:02:32.980> profit<00:02:33.780> stuff<00:02:34.780> inside<00:02:35.380> to<00:02:35.880> support

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
cottony profit stuff inside to support

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.100 
cottony profit stuff inside to support
it<00:02:37.030> during<00:02:37.960> the<00:02:38.110> firing<00:02:39.420> when<00:02:40.420> it<00:02:40.570> goes<00:02:40.780> in

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
it during the firing when it goes in
