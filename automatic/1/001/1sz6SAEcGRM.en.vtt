00:00:00.509 --> 00:00:03.509
 what are you exactly in the locker room after 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.300
 well it's hard to find the words but hey 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.060
 laval simply you'll have to put this game is to forget 

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.019
 to all 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:13.669
 and then if it's just that to start the same nonsense 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:16.669
 because it's true that i livity that night we cracked 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:19.369
 the nerves have dropped a dog in some 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.289
 in the Breton club 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.609
 we want to play at the level of sapad already not by this kind of match of which you 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:26.669
 arrive you have to remember 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:28.169
 not answered the convocations 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:31.659
 even if the referee stopped one way tonight but hey 

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:34.890
 it's not serious Eurobarometer in travel time and 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.180
 we hope 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.680
 while our place 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.700
 attention he felt a little bit before 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.400
 during the match itself did not take place 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.180
 these clashes 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.890
 he thought we were little more on the fire 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:47.880
 brabant 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.950
 a bit of a light visa retracing more to the race I had attended without a vote 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.610
 on the fact that we with hate provoking so I had asked to 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.450
 each to do a job for four years and I want it to be even 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.350
 we can recall the conditions and facts of the match with the arbitration 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.410
 therefore the glacis difficult to control 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.450
 but beautiful but that's fine it will serve me for rock for the future husband 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.740
 and you do not know it's sorry it ends like that because good morale has 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.060
 favorite witch 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.980
 in an other way 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.220
 and also the match for third place the you try to 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.270
 to bounce dr house for this game will go from bouncing back very quickly to what 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.020
 will arrive quickly 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.620
 you have to recover 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.610
 karlovic setbacks it must appear there this match for the third 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.130
 square 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.500
 besides the two Nigerians it will not be the same atmosphere that you have tried 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.700
 to have to concentrate alone on board and how 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.310
 that's already well we'll rest well and when we try to focus on 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.710
 be 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.830
 praia - tanseau will pass that's what these cases and egypt algeria 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:38.970
 consumers 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.130
 we have a problem I think 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.590
 3 24th place in h-cup less pressure maybe some 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.590
 arrive not yet completed at the press ste 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.110
 we are happy and proud of my career 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.970
 to talk about a heat do you know sql 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.760
 as are more physical you say we will try to play on our qualities 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.329
 to see in the focus is a very physical team 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:00.270
 we know we know a few times this season 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.050
 it's okay, it's going really fast 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.050
 on the other hand messier farce so his back was not happening by chance so 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.070
 we will find his way 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.899
 on the customers 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.969
 we are more nuanced but hey it's especially his taste must focus 

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:16.109
 as I take ruckus deposits and to properly recover and empty 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:18.550
 these results pleasure to the fans we saw 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.980
 today the Algerian fans to brushard we will try to finish in 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.300
 beauty because the program on leaving college 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.000
 a little difficult but we will try to get back to really stand 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.780
 at this rate of fire
