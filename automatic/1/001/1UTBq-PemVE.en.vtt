these<00:01:32.009> dreams<00:01:32.310> where<00:01:32.460> you're<00:01:32.610> kind<00:01:32.729> of

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
these dreams where you're kind of

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.100 
these dreams where you're kind of
floating<00:01:33.150> above<00:01:33.329> yourself<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.930> see

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
floating above yourself and you see

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.859 
floating above yourself and you see
yourself<00:01:34.470> down<00:01:34.680> there<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.869> the

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
yourself down there and and the

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:37.910 
yourself down there and and the
interesting<00:01:37.320> thing<00:01:37.439> about<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.770> though<00:01:37.890> is

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
interesting thing about it though is

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.460 
interesting thing about it though is
that<00:01:38.630> people<00:01:39.630> we've<00:01:39.960> been<00:01:40.079> talking<00:01:40.380> about

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
that people we've been talking about

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.380 
that people we've been talking about
this<00:01:40.680> at<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.009> show<00:01:41.189> as<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.369> third-person<00:01:41.880> game

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
this at the show as a third-person game

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.030 
this at the show as a third-person game
but<00:01:42.840> it's<00:01:42.960> almost<00:01:43.079> not<00:01:43.470> really<00:01:43.740> a

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
but it's almost not really a

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.380 
but it's almost not really a
third-person<00:01:44.369> game<00:01:44.610> because<00:01:44.850> when<00:01:45.270> you're

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
third-person game because when you're

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.569 
third-person game because when you're
playing<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:46.079> don't<00:01:46.259> feel<00:01:46.530> like<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.950> am<00:01:47.369> the

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
playing it you don't feel like I am the

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.340 
playing it you don't feel like I am the
character<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:48.240> feel<00:01:48.450> like<00:01:48.570> you're<00:01:48.810> still<00:01:49.079> you

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
character you feel like you're still you

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.749 
character you feel like you're still you
because<00:01:49.649> that's<00:01:49.770> what<00:01:49.890> virtuality<00:01:50.220> does<00:01:50.579> it

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
because that's what virtuality does it

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.130 
because that's what virtuality does it
makes<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.030> feel<00:01:51.210> like<00:01:51.329> you're<00:01:51.570> there<00:01:51.869> and

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
makes you feel like you're there and

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.069 
makes you feel like you're there and
lucky<00:01:52.799> is<00:01:52.920> almost<00:01:53.250> like<00:01:53.460> this<00:01:53.729> toy<00:01:54.720> that

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
little things in the game to kind of

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.399 
little things in the game to kind of
enhance<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.689> like<00:02:00.840> when<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.049> looked<00:02:01.259> at<00:02:01.380> it

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
delivery of the game so that it's kind

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.770 
delivery of the game so that it's kind
of<00:02:17.070> the<00:02:17.130> same<00:02:17.370> we've<00:02:17.670> been<00:02:17.850> doing<00:02:18.120> this<00:02:18.210> for<00:02:18.450> a

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
of the same we've been doing this for a

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.090 
of the same we've been doing this for a
number<00:02:18.810> of<00:02:19.110> years<00:02:19.320> now<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.560> game<00:02:19.830> that<00:02:20.010> we

number of years now the game that we

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.620 
number of years now the game that we
actually<00:02:20.370> made<00:02:20.520> before<00:02:20.850> this<00:02:21.030> was<00:02:21.240> words<00:02:21.480> with

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
actually made before this was words with

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.410 
actually made before this was words with
friends<00:02:21.660> and<00:02:22.440> then<00:02:22.800> yeah<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:23.580> then<00:02:23.700> we<00:02:23.850> I<00:02:24.090> know

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
friends and then yeah and then we I know

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.060 
friends and then yeah and then we I know
it's<00:02:24.630> kind<00:02:24.780> of<00:02:24.810> like<00:02:24.900> what's<00:02:25.110> one<00:02:25.860> of<00:02:25.890> those

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
it's kind of like what's one of those

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.310 
it's kind of like what's one of those
have<00:02:26.310> in<00:02:26.550> common<00:02:26.700> but<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.600> reason<00:02:27.900> is<00:02:28.020> when<00:02:28.230> we

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
have in common but the reason is when we

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.170 
have in common but the reason is when we
first<00:02:28.470> saw<00:02:28.710> an<00:02:28.800> iPhone<00:02:29.220> we<00:02:29.430> just<00:02:29.610> we<00:02:29.850> just<00:02:29.880> held

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
first saw an iPhone we just we just held

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.160 
first saw an iPhone we just we just held
it<00:02:30.300> in<00:02:30.360> our<00:02:30.420> hands<00:02:30.570> we<00:02:30.720> thought<00:02:30.870> this<00:02:31.020> is<00:02:31.110> the

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
it in our hands we thought this is the

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.480 
it in our hands we thought this is the
coolest<00:02:31.500> thing<00:02:31.620> we<00:02:31.680> have<00:02:31.800> to<00:02:32.010> make<00:02:32.130> games<00:02:32.310> for

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
coolest thing we have to make games for

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.460 
coolest thing we have to make games for
this<00:02:32.580> it<00:02:33.420> was<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:33.660> same<00:02:33.870> thing<00:02:33.900> for<00:02:34.080> virtual

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
this it was the same thing for virtual

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.960 
this it was the same thing for virtual
reality<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.800> moment<00:02:35.190> I<00:02:35.250> saw<00:02:35.460> it<00:02:35.490> I<00:02:35.790> was<00:02:35.940> just

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
reality the moment I saw it I was just

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.580 
reality the moment I saw it I was just
like<00:02:36.210> this<00:02:36.510> is<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.810> coolest<00:02:37.110> they<00:02:37.260> have<00:02:37.410> ever

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
like this is the coolest they have ever

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.770 
like this is the coolest they have ever
seen<00:02:37.710> this<00:02:37.980> is<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.130> future<00:02:38.670> of<00:02:38.700> games<00:02:39.420> I<00:02:39.630> have

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
seen this is the future of games I have

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.750 
seen this is the future of games I have
to<00:02:39.900> make<00:02:40.020> games<00:02:40.230> for<00:02:40.290> this<00:02:40.500> how<00:02:41.280> did<00:02:41.460> you<00:02:41.550> plan

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
to make games for this how did you plan

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.520 
to make games for this how did you plan
that<00:02:42.030> I<00:02:42.330> mean<00:02:42.690> it's<00:02:42.870> it's<00:02:43.050> like<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.380> new

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
that I mean it's it's like a new

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.420 
that I mean it's it's like a new
frontier<00:02:44.040> of<00:02:45.170> enjoying<00:02:46.170> games<00:02:46.530> so<00:02:47.010> what

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430

assumptions<00:02:55.050> because<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:56.190> things<00:02:56.520> that

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
assumptions because the things that

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.010 
assumptions because the things that
first<00:02:56.880> come<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.150> mind<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:57.600> you<00:02:57.660> think<00:02:57.840> about

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
first come to mind and you think about

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.890 
first come to mind and you think about
VR<00:02:58.380> are<00:02:58.710> you<00:02:59.460> know<00:02:59.580> I<00:02:59.610> probably<00:03:00.240> like<00:03:00.510> shooters

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
VR are you know I probably like shooters

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.750 
VR are you know I probably like shooters
and<00:03:01.290> driving<00:03:01.800> games<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:02.370> those<00:03:02.460> kinds<00:03:02.730> of

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
and driving games and those kinds of

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.340 
and driving games and those kinds of
things<00:03:02.850> and<00:03:03.180> we<00:03:03.630> really<00:03:03.900> wanted<00:03:04.110> to<00:03:04.200> try

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
things and we really wanted to try

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.440 
things and we really wanted to try
something<00:03:04.710> new<00:03:04.890> so<00:03:05.190> we<00:03:05.460> tried<00:03:05.700> we<00:03:05.880> built<00:03:06.090> a<00:03:06.180> lot

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
something new so we tried we built a lot

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.760 
something new so we tried we built a lot
of<00:03:06.600> different<00:03:06.870> prototypes<00:03:07.140> everything<00:03:07.650> from

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
of different prototypes everything from

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.890 
of different prototypes everything from
like<00:03:07.920> an<00:03:08.070> aquarium<00:03:08.700> simulator<00:03:09.390> to<00:03:09.720> like<00:03:09.870> a

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
like an aquarium simulator to like a

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.690 
like an aquarium simulator to like a
dancing<00:03:10.560> game<00:03:10.770> to<00:03:11.040> I<00:03:11.070> mean<00:03:11.220> we<00:03:11.280> just<00:03:11.430> tried<00:03:11.580> all

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
dancing game to I mean we just tried all

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.730 
dancing game to I mean we just tried all
these<00:03:11.850> different<00:03:12.150> ideas<00:03:12.270> and<00:03:12.660> when<00:03:13.440> we<00:03:13.530> built

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
these different ideas and when we built

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.460 
these different ideas and when we built
this<00:03:13.860> third<00:03:14.130> person<00:03:14.550> game<00:03:14.730> it<00:03:15.120> just<00:03:16.020> clicked

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
this third person game it just clicked

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.020 
this third person game it just clicked
like<00:03:16.739> it<00:03:16.980> is<00:03:17.100> this<00:03:17.250> moment<00:03:17.459> where<00:03:17.700> you<00:03:17.850> look

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
look across and you see the whole level

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.449 
look across and you see the whole level
just<00:03:25.440> stretching<00:03:25.800> out<00:03:25.920> there<00:03:26.100> and<00:03:26.280> it's<00:03:26.400> like

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
just stretching out there and it's like

oh that is the coolest thing at the

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.610 
oh that is the coolest thing at the
moment<00:03:29.280> we<00:03:29.580> kind<00:03:30.030> of<00:03:30.150> had<00:03:30.780> that<00:03:30.810> we<00:03:31.260> saw<00:03:31.440> that

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
moment we kind of had that we saw that

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.140 
moment we kind of had that we saw that
that<00:03:31.800> magic<00:03:32.250> we<00:03:32.459> knew<00:03:32.640> we<00:03:32.760> had<00:03:32.790> to<00:03:32.910> make<00:03:33.060> this

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
that magic we knew we had to make this

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.910 
that magic we knew we had to make this
game<00:03:33.330> the<00:03:33.600> interesting<00:03:34.200> thing<00:03:34.410> about<00:03:34.440> this<00:03:34.739> is

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
game the interesting thing about this is

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.350 
game the interesting thing about this is
you<00:03:35.040> it's<00:03:35.280> like<00:03:35.489> putting<00:03:35.760> your<00:03:35.790> head<00:03:36.030> into<00:03:36.330> a

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
you it's like putting your head into a

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.990 
you it's like putting your head into a
dome<00:03:36.660> because<00:03:37.170> you<00:03:37.290> can<00:03:37.530> see<00:03:37.770> full<00:03:38.640> range<00:03:38.880> of

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
dome because you can see full range of

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.970 
dome because you can see full range of
motion<00:03:39.180> around<00:03:39.630> you<00:03:39.930> down<00:03:40.440> and<00:03:40.770> look<00:03:40.860> around

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
know I expected my foot to be there

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.090 
know I expected my foot to be there
because<00:03:44.940> I'm<00:03:45.180> not<00:03:45.330> used<00:03:45.600> to<00:03:45.720> this<00:03:45.900> yet<00:03:46.170> so<00:03:46.560> how

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
because I'm not used to this yet so how

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.130 
because I'm not used to this yet so how
do<00:03:47.160> you<00:03:47.280> design<00:03:47.430> in<00:03:47.790> a<00:03:48.060> world<00:03:48.270> that<00:03:48.510> that<00:03:48.840> has

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
do you design in a world that that has

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.620 
do you design in a world that that has
that<00:03:49.440> lack<00:03:50.130> of<00:03:50.370> limitation<00:03:50.910> even<00:03:51.150> well<00:03:51.510> the

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
that lack of limitation even well the

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.300 
that lack of limitation even well the
thing<00:03:51.810> is<00:03:51.840> like<00:03:52.170> well<00:03:52.650> you<00:03:52.920> know<00:03:53.010> when<00:03:53.190> we're

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
thing is like well you know when we're

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.040 
thing is like well you know when we're
making<00:03:53.400> games<00:03:53.730> for<00:03:53.850> a<00:03:53.970> TV<00:03:54.209> we<00:03:54.630> can<00:03:54.780> do<00:03:54.930> all

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
making games for a TV we can do all

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.810 
making games for a TV we can do all
these<00:03:55.170> tricks<00:03:55.380> like<00:03:55.709> I've<00:03:56.280> never<00:03:56.489> had<00:03:56.730> to

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
these tricks like I've never had to

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.460 
these tricks like I've never had to
worry<00:03:57.000> about<00:03:57.060> what's<00:03:57.390> behind<00:03:57.630> you<00:03:58.080> in<00:03:58.230> a<00:03:58.320> game

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
worry about what's behind you in a game

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.740 
worry about what's behind you in a game
before<00:03:58.860> but<00:03:59.040> in<00:03:59.130> virtual<00:03:59.459> reality<00:03:59.660> you<00:04:00.660> have

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
before but in virtual reality you have

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.570 
before but in virtual reality you have
to<00:04:00.900> eat<00:04:01.140> the<00:04:01.320> whole<00:04:01.350> world<00:04:01.860> has<00:04:02.100> to<00:04:02.130> be<00:04:02.280> fully

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
to eat the whole world has to be fully

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.340 
to eat the whole world has to be fully
realized<00:04:02.850> because<00:04:03.540> you<00:04:03.660> can<00:04:03.810> literally<00:04:04.080> look

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
realized because you can literally look

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.350 
realized because you can literally look
everywhere<00:04:04.800> and<00:04:04.860> see<00:04:05.130> anything<00:04:05.580> and<00:04:05.790> you<00:04:06.270> know

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
everywhere and see anything and you know

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.030 
everywhere and see anything and you know
everything<00:04:06.750> has<00:04:06.870> to<00:04:07.019> have<00:04:07.140> like<00:04:07.440> just<00:04:07.890> the

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
everything has to have like just the

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.430 
everything has to have like just the
right<00:04:08.160> level<00:04:08.340> of<00:04:08.459> detail<00:04:08.550> and<00:04:09.239> because<00:04:10.200> your

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
right level of detail and because your

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.229 
right level of detail and because your
brain<00:04:10.680> is<00:04:10.890> so<00:04:11.070> sensitive<00:04:11.700> to<00:04:11.820> those<00:04:11.940> things

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
brain is so sensitive to those things

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:13.610 
brain is so sensitive to those things
when<00:04:12.450> you're<00:04:12.570> literally<00:04:13.019> feel<00:04:13.350> like<00:04:13.380> you're

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
when you're literally feel like you're

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.530 
when you're literally feel like you're
in<00:04:13.739> another<00:04:13.800> world<00:04:14.070> you<00:04:14.700> know<00:04:14.820> do<00:04:15.390> you<00:04:15.480> think

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
in another world you know do you think

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.080 
in another world you know do you think
this<00:04:15.810> will<00:04:15.930> make<00:04:16.109> people<00:04:16.549> well<00:04:17.549> we're<00:04:17.910> just

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
this will make people well we're just

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.990
