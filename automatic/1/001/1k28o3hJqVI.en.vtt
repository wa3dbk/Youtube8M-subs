dry system and pretty much wear black

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.520 
dry system and pretty much wear black
just<00:01:35.729> tries<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.119> use<00:01:36.390> this<00:01:36.570> poem<00:01:36.869> structure<00:01:37.380> to

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
just tries to use this poem structure to

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.530 
just tries to use this poem structure to
control<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.100> movement<00:01:38.520> for<00:01:38.549> white<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.090> it's

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
control the movement for white and it's

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.000 
control the movement for white and it's
difficult<00:01:39.930> for<00:01:40.020> white<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.320> gain<00:01:40.650> an<00:01:40.830> advantage

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010

that's<00:01:41.880> my<00:01:42.090> many<00:01:42.330> players<00:01:42.659> play<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.080> CARICOM

that's my many players play the CARICOM

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.249 
that's my many players play the CARICOM
so<00:01:45.920> the<00:01:46.920> next<00:01:47.070> move<00:01:47.310> for<00:01:47.340> for<00:01:48.210> white<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.689> d<00:01:49.020> for

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
so the next move for for white is d for

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.420 
so the next move for for white is d for
obtaining<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.460> perfect<00:01:50.820> center<00:01:52.430> occupying
