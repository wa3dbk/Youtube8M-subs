milestone to me it's it's more about the
team<00:02:03.820> and<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:04.570> guys<00:02:04.780> that<00:02:04.810> I've<00:02:05.110> played<00:02:05.350> with

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
team and the guys that I've played with

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.580 
team and the guys that I've played with
their<00:02:06.850> unselfishness<00:02:07.480> you<00:02:08.080> see<00:02:08.260> me<00:02:08.380> making

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
their unselfishness you see me making

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.710 
their unselfishness you see me making
shots<00:02:08.890> but<00:02:09.160> people<00:02:09.760> don't<00:02:09.850> necessarily<00:02:10.060> see

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
shots but people don't necessarily see

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.150 
shots but people don't necessarily see
what<00:02:10.930> goes<00:02:11.110> into<00:02:11.320> that<00:02:11.470> and<00:02:11.770> the<00:02:11.830> teamwork

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
what goes into that and the teamwork

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.400 
what goes into that and the teamwork
that's<00:02:12.370> involved<00:02:12.700> in<00:02:12.940> making<00:02:13.870> those<00:02:14.110> shots

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
that's involved in making those shots

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.050 
that's involved in making those shots
it's<00:02:14.650> you<00:02:15.040> know<00:02:15.160> it's<00:02:15.310> really<00:02:15.520> is<00:02:15.700> a<00:02:15.730> team

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
it's you know it's really is a team

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.730 
it's you know it's really is a team
effort<00:02:16.210> and<00:02:16.630> it's<00:02:16.930> something<00:02:17.170> that<00:02:17.320> Open

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
effort and it's something that Open

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.700 
effort and it's something that Open
University<00:02:17.890> can<00:02:18.370> be<00:02:18.400> proud<00:02:18.640> of
