00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:08.360
 Yes, prepare one belly 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.360
 adhesive 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.530
 Scissors 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.670
 Hmm 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:21.990
 Please prepare at high school nori 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:23.200
 At this time, I will use glue instead of using plaster. 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.230
 Then 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:30.440
 We will separate the rose petals and jaw 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.910
 I will explain from the middle of things 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:36.840
 One piece of petal like this 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.840
 I will take 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.289
 Let's take it and get it 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:56.950
 The sound also cuts from the middle, not from the root 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:01:00.660
 Please use it like this for later . Please keep it without throwing it away . 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.660
 If the wall is 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:08.520
 I cut it while drawing the lower strike 4 in a little semicircle 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:13.140
 me too 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.110
 Make a semicircular cut like this in all 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.650
 Immediately in 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:23.700
 I will make it bloom 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.700
 Please arrange the petal from small to large . 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.539
 With plenty of glue 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.470
 I will flower to push it up from below 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:45.020
 Put plenty 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:45.020
 Change the place a little and finish the piece from the bottom 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.680
 It seems to push up from the bottom 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.299
 It's like this 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.800
 And shift slightly again 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.120
 Raw shifted little by little 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:22.819
 Bloom 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.819
 I will create an image 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.770
 So 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.110
 I will do the wisdom of the wood to push up 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.360
 Well Kochirako It is here 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.180
 It blooms nicely 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.550
 Ah 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.380
 Do you say 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.959
 Since the adhesive is good only at the bottom 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.820
 Do you see it getting bigger ? 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:10.200
 It became the last one 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:13.519
 This time I made one rose flower, but if I want to make it bigger I use 2 belly to make it bigger 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.519
 You can also 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:24.980
 It was possible to flower like this 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.980
 I have taken it earlier 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:32.280
 Plenty dipped towards the Are You the owner shop Studies of the school district back 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:44.980
 For the amount of the cut behind 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:47.430
 Together 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.430
 Turn on 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:03.010
 Attach each and every amount 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:09.580
 How in the form of the finish 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:10.419
 Also visible in the volume up by first small was roses bloom in Fu say large 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.160
