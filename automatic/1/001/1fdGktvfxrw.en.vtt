00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.609
 I have asked all of them here in the next and probably most important phase of the 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:18.749
 Explain operation 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:20.919
 the spacecraft is in orbit 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:23.960
 the telescope installed and checked 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.960
 with the Palace 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:28.869
 if the part 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.430
 Problem is one and «4» on a flight ball, they are now the one with the 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.200
 Probe is complementary 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.460
 if we succeed we can do the performance in the 1 14 Euro 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.460
 activate and set to the tempo and set 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.460
 Of course that requires exactly the planning for the interceptors 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.940
 we did a computer survey on and especially flights 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.860
 marked under usual course 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.269
 I hope it is clear to him 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:55.960
 Materna because it has set a schedule for the interceptors 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.530
 but nevertheless decisions will have to be taken on a case by case basis 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.510
 means that it must be improvised the actors 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.700
 is not that dangerous there is a certain risk involved 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.900
 let's say a calculated one 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.010
 With all precision you have to deal with human and technical failure 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.010
 count 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.910
 so now we have nothing to do but wait for Alu 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.090
 to somehow get involved in saying no 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.170
 so be 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.170
 We trek on the tent project catholic 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.220
 I would like to thank him for the work you have done in this case 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.270
 had taken over 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.750
 for the many hours she sacrificed but what about her 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.210
 I think they always take over a bit 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.650
 they afford to know that 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.450
 the work of a man 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.009
 but they just want to do better if they are a woman 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.330
 Do not forget about all the work 1 you are a very pretty girl 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.569
 Thanks for the Coffee 

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:19.769
 serve 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.769
 percent 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.599
 Jane Foster 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:29.619
 then fly yes 

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:32.619
 Tomorrow come 18 clock 

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:35.829
 Percent 4 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:38.549
 because we give them life advice 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.029
 judge a situation at the end of a conversation
