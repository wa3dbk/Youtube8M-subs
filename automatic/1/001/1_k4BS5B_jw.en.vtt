 [Music] 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.700
 we can rarely listen to those who 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:15.010
 they know the illegal occupation of 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.770
 Palestinian territories first-hand 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:21.070
 the Israeli soldiers themselves because 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:23.140
 it is they who exercise this young man 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.990
 former soldier has gathered in a book 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.180
 hundreds of testimonies from colleagues who 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.340
 dismantle the notion that the army 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.039
 Israeli is defending its 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.649
 citizens rather shows a 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:38.230
 offensive army that practices 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:40.530
 arbitrary detentions punishments 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.540
 Collective revenge operations 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.840
 blockages of entire neighborhoods registers 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.870
 night robberies in houses and infinity of 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:53.730
 abuses against the Palestinian population 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.730
 all in the name of the security of israel 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.120
 at this very moment for example in the 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.860
 city ​​of hebron there are patrols walking 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.050
 down the street they do it from 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.089
 September 2000 the orders that 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.549
 have the soldiers is that they should be done 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.409
 present as we do we enter 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:10.030
 any house we put to the 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.640
 men to the left women to the 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.450
 right we identify them we record the 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.030
 home 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.700
 and then we go to another one like this six or 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.860
 seven houses every night this photo by 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.200
 example shows soldiers who 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.270
 they locked up a Palestinian family in 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.420
 a room while they are 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.970
 they dedicated to watch a football game the 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.860
 objective that the NGO seeks breaking the 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.920
 silence is to show society 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:39.990
 Israeli the reality of the occupation 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.250
 military of the Palestinian territories 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.439
 what we are doing is putting a 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.240
 mirror in front of our society and 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:48.130
 teaching the reality that supposes 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.319
 control a people by force 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.390
 and what made us born as soldiers 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:54.520
 in our organization we are in 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.500
 against martial law what we want 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.450
 is to put an end to this idea that we can 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.610
 control a whole people through the 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.560
 force and continue with our lives as 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.450
 if nothing had happened the occupation 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.599
 illegal of the Palestinian territories 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.179
 lasts more than 40 years and every year the 

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:12.730
 illegal settlements continue to grow 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.799
 for now peace and justice for the 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.489
 Palestinian people are still 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:22.019
 too far josé manuel rodríguez
