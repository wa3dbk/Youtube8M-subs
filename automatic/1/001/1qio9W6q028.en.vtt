00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
it looks fantastic but I still don't get

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.899 
it looks fantastic but I still don't get
how<00:01:21.210> do<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.540> make<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:21.840> thin<00:01:22.259> well<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.340> take

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
how do you make it so thin well you take

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.840 
how do you make it so thin well you take
out<00:01:24.090> parts<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.990> real<00:01:25.259> trick<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.950> making<00:01:26.159> that

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
out parts the real trick is making that

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.020 
out parts the real trick is making that
whole<00:01:27.350> LCD<00:01:28.350> wafer<00:01:28.770> as<00:01:28.920> thin<00:01:29.189> as<00:01:29.220> possible<00:01:29.520> so

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
whole LCD wafer as thin as possible so

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.969 
whole LCD wafer as thin as possible so
we're<00:01:30.180> using<00:01:30.360> glass<00:01:30.840> we're<00:01:31.500> using<00:01:31.650> high-tech

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
we're using glass we're using high-tech

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.190 
we're using glass we're using high-tech
manufacturing<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:33.150> put<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.450> all<00:01:33.570> together<00:01:33.780> in

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
manufacturing to put it all together in

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.170 
manufacturing to put it all together in
a<00:01:34.560> really<00:01:35.009> smooth<00:01:35.369> design<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.820> has<00:01:35.850> almost

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
a really smooth design that has almost

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.240 
a really smooth design that has almost
no<00:01:36.479> bezel<00:01:36.900> at<00:01:37.020> all<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.470> that's<00:01:37.860> really

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
no bezel at all and that's really

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.499 
no bezel at all and that's really
incredible<00:01:38.369> because<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:39.060> have<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.329> put<00:01:39.479> the

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
incredible because you have to put the

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.359 
incredible because you have to put the
light<00:01:39.780> somewhere<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.590> delight<00:01:41.100> up<00:01:41.250> the

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
light somewhere to delight up the

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.160 
light somewhere to delight up the
pitcher<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:42.270> make<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.450> all<00:01:42.659> fit<00:01:42.960> in<00:01:43.140> that

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
pitcher and to make it all fit in that

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.109 
pitcher and to make it all fit in that
form<00:01:43.560> factor<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.220> then<00:01:44.369> still<00:01:44.640> be<00:01:44.759> able<00:01:44.850> to

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
form factor and then still be able to

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.030 
form factor and then still be able to
design<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.720> with<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.320> included<00:01:46.590> mount<00:01:46.890> that

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
design it with the included mount that

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.100 
design it with the included mount that

that's<00:01:51.720> like<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:51.930> prototype<00:01:52.530> that's<00:01:52.829> gonna

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
that's like a prototype that's gonna

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.469 
that's like a prototype that's gonna
come<00:01:53.130> out<00:01:53.250> in<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.399> future<00:01:53.700> or<00:01:53.909> will<00:01:54.119> we<00:01:54.299> see
