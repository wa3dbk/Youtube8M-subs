00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
was and it's really about doing what the

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
rather than trying to be fancy and

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.020 
rather than trying to be fancy and
glorious<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.520> you<00:00:41.520> know<00:00:41.610> taking<00:00:41.910> out<00:00:41.969> your

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
glorious and you know taking out your

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.819 
glorious and you know taking out your
opponent<00:00:42.540> at<00:00:42.629> every<00:00:42.960> turn<00:00:43.200> when<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.559> have<00:00:43.680> the

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
opponent at every turn when you have the

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.889 
opponent at every turn when you have the
opportunity<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:45.090> great<00:00:45.120> example<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.809> this

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
opportunity and a great example of this

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.569 
opportunity and a great example of this
actually<00:00:46.079> happened<00:00:46.620> in<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.800> recent<00:00:47.160> game<00:00:47.309> and

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
actually happened in a recent game and

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.889 
actually happened in a recent game and
I'm<00:00:47.670> using<00:00:47.850> kind<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.329> some<00:00:48.480> proxies<00:00:48.870> but

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
I'm using kind of some proxies but

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.260 
I'm using kind of some proxies but
you'll<00:00:49.200> get<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.440> general<00:00:49.710> idea<00:00:49.940> I<00:00:50.940> was

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
you'll get the general idea I was

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.360 
you'll get the general idea I was
playing<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.570> Rick<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.020> Rick's<00:00:52.559> it's<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.070> really

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
playing a Rick and Rick's it's a really

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.410 
playing a Rick and Rick's it's a really
good<00:00:53.489> player<00:00:53.730> he's<00:00:53.940> probably<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.390> best

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
good player he's probably the best

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.910 
good player he's probably the best
player<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:54.840> we<00:00:55.050> have<00:00:55.199> here<00:00:55.559> at<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.710> store

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
player that we have here at the store

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.939 
player that we have here at the store
and<00:00:56.879> he<00:00:56.940> was<00:00:57.300> playing<00:00:57.449> Touhou<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.350> as<00:00:58.859> you

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
and he was playing Touhou and as you

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.200 
and he was playing Touhou and as you
guys<00:00:59.039> know<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.399> hawk<00:00:59.609> can<00:00:59.760> be<00:00:59.879> really

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
guys know to hawk can be really

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.330 
guys know to hawk can be really
terrifying<00:01:01.050> but<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.320> was<00:01:01.469> doing<00:01:01.710> quite<00:01:01.829> well<00:01:01.949> my

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
terrifying but I was doing quite well my

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.270 
terrifying but I was doing quite well my
first<00:01:02.609> turn<00:01:02.850> was<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.989> good<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.860> was<00:01:04.949> one<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.220> the

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
first turn was so good it was one of the

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.859 
first turn was so good it was one of the
best<00:01:05.430> turns<00:01:05.640> infinity<00:01:06.119> I've<00:01:06.240> ever<00:01:06.420> taken<00:01:06.659> I

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
best turns infinity I've ever taken I

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.000 
best turns infinity I've ever taken I
captured<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.290> was<00:01:07.409> playing<00:01:07.590> lifeblood<00:01:07.920> I

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
captured it was playing lifeblood I

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.980 
captured it was playing lifeblood I
captured<00:01:08.490> like<00:01:08.640> three<00:01:09.240> objective<00:01:09.689> points

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
captured like three objective points

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.140 
captured like three objective points
that<00:01:10.110> turn<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.590> got<00:01:10.770> my<00:01:10.920> link<00:01:11.130> team<00:01:11.369> back<00:01:11.850> into

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
that turn and got my link team back into

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.450 
that turn and got my link team back into
Cup<00:01:12.479> like<00:01:12.720> full<00:01:13.080> cover<00:01:13.380> there<00:01:13.950> was<00:01:14.070> nothing

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
Cup like full cover there was nothing

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.980 
Cup like full cover there was nothing
that<00:01:14.490> Rick<00:01:14.790> could<00:01:14.909> do<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.210> kind<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.420> exploit<00:01:15.840> my

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
that Rick could do to kind of exploit my

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.109 
that Rick could do to kind of exploit my
weakness<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:16.470> his<00:01:16.619> first<00:01:16.830> turn<00:01:17.130> was<00:01:17.820> moving

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
weakness so his first turn was moving

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.730 
weakness so his first turn was moving
his<00:01:18.240> forces<00:01:18.630> up<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.869> side<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.259> board<00:01:19.470> and

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
his forces up the side of the board and

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.740 
his forces up the side of the board and
he<00:01:20.040> got<00:01:20.159> like<00:01:20.310> maybe<00:01:20.430> one<00:01:20.759> or<00:01:20.939> two<00:01:20.970> points<00:01:21.540> and

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
he got like maybe one or two points and

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.719 
he got like maybe one or two points and
was<00:01:22.020> kind<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.259> positioned<00:01:22.740> he<00:01:23.130> took<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.340> shot<00:01:23.580> at

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
was kind of positioned he took a shot at

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.550 
was kind of positioned he took a shot at
one<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:23.939> my<00:01:24.000> guys<00:01:24.180> knocked<00:01:24.780> him<00:01:24.960> out<00:01:25.049> no<00:01:25.439> big

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
one of my guys knocked him out no big

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.210 
one of my guys knocked him out no big
deal<00:01:25.770> now<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:27.180> it's<00:01:27.810> it's<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.320> proxy<00:01:29.009> for

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
deal now this is a it's it's a proxy for

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.140 
deal now this is a it's it's a proxy for
like<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.400> Gao

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
like a Gao

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.090 
like a Gao
rail<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.780> think<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.079> what<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.290> call<00:01:31.500> Gale<00:01:31.770> Rao

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
rail I think is what you call Gale Rao

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.100 
rail I think is what you call Gale Rao
or<00:01:32.460> however<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.360> toha<00:01:33.659> pronounced<00:01:33.990> a

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
or however the the toha pronounced a

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.140 
or however the the toha pronounced a
they<00:01:34.380> probably<00:01:34.530> have<00:01:34.710> like<00:01:34.860> 20<00:01:34.890> tongues<00:01:35.369> but

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
they probably have like 20 tongues but

get a physical I can't quite remember I

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:46.900 
get a physical I can't quite remember I
think<00:02:45.860> we<00:02:45.920> looked<00:02:46.130> it<00:02:46.250> up<00:02:46.340> and<00:02:46.489> I<00:02:46.580> rolled<00:02:46.790> it

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
think we looked it up and I rolled it

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.020 
think we looked it up and I rolled it
and<00:02:47.840> so<00:02:48.019> this<00:02:48.200> guy's<00:02:48.410> stuck<00:02:48.819> which<00:02:49.819> was

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
and so this guy's stuck which was

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.120 
and so this guy's stuck which was
unnecessary<00:02:50.660> completely<00:02:51.500> unnecessary

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
unnecessary completely unnecessary

he can't even cover this side of the

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
board like he he's really cut off from

board like he he's really cut off from
his<00:02:59.090> options<00:02:59.510> so<00:02:59.930> that<00:02:59.959> unit<00:03:00.410> isn't<00:03:00.620> really

his options so that unit isn't really
probably<00:03:01.130> gonna<00:03:01.340> do<00:03:01.580> a<00:03:01.610> lot<00:03:01.880> in<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.120> future<00:03:02.299> of

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
probably gonna do a lot in the future of

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.360 
probably gonna do a lot in the future of
this<00:03:02.540> game<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:02.989> instead<00:03:03.650> I<00:03:03.890> took<00:03:04.099> a<00:03:04.130> chance

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
this game and instead I took a chance

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.070 
this game and instead I took a chance
there's<00:03:04.640> a<00:03:04.700> very<00:03:04.880> high<00:03:05.090> probability<00:03:05.390> chance

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
there's a very high probability chance

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.650 
there's a very high probability chance
but<00:03:06.680> it<00:03:06.769> also<00:03:06.980> opened<00:03:07.430> me<00:03:07.519> up<00:03:07.549> to<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:08.060> risk<00:03:08.360> of

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
but it also opened me up to the risk of

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.180 
but it also opened me up to the risk of
like<00:03:08.840> that<00:03:09.019> five<00:03:09.319> to<00:03:09.590> ten<00:03:09.769> percent<00:03:10.130> chance

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
like that five to ten percent chance

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.339 
like that five to ten percent chance
that<00:03:10.970> I<00:03:11.000> was<00:03:11.150> going<00:03:11.360> to<00:03:11.450> lose<00:03:11.660> that<00:03:11.900> role<00:03:12.140> and

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:12.349 
that I was going to lose that role and

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.370 
that I was going to lose that role and
get<00:03:13.130> a<00:03:13.160> guy<00:03:13.340> stuck<00:03:13.610> for<00:03:13.940> no<00:03:14.030> reason<00:03:14.360> and<00:03:14.720> so

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
get a guy stuck for no reason and so

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.289 
get a guy stuck for no reason and so
then<00:03:15.530> my<00:03:15.560> next<00:03:16.010> move<00:03:16.190> was<00:03:16.489> when<00:03:16.790> I<00:03:16.880> was<00:03:17.120> mad

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
then my next move was when I was mad

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.630 
then my next move was when I was mad
about<00:03:17.450> it<00:03:17.720> I'm<00:03:18.109> not<00:03:18.140> actually<00:03:18.500> angry<00:03:18.920> but<00:03:19.489> like

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
about it I'm not actually angry but like

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.130 
about it I'm not actually angry but like
I<00:03:19.850> was<00:03:20.000> I<00:03:20.209> was<00:03:20.450> upset

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
I was I was upset

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.650 
I was I was upset
and<00:03:21.230> so<00:03:21.769> I<00:03:21.799> moved<00:03:22.070> this<00:03:22.910> other<00:03:23.060> guy<00:03:23.239> since<00:03:23.510> my

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
and so I moved this other guy since my

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.449 
and so I moved this other guy since my
link<00:03:23.870> team<00:03:24.049> is<00:03:24.230> still<00:03:24.709> technically<00:03:25.130> a<00:03:25.220> thing

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
link team is still technically a thing

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.580 
link team is still technically a thing
and<00:03:25.670> I<00:03:25.850> think<00:03:26.239> he<00:03:26.420> was<00:03:26.540> over<00:03:26.750> here<00:03:26.780> and<00:03:27.140> I<00:03:27.470> think

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
and I think he was over here and I think

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.349 
and I think he was over here and I think
we<00:03:27.799> allowed<00:03:28.040> cover<00:03:28.340> there's<00:03:28.850> something<00:03:29.180> and<00:03:29.299> I

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
we allowed cover there's something and I

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:31.630 
we allowed cover there's something and I
took<00:03:29.450> another<00:03:29.720> shot<00:03:29.989> and<00:03:30.200> he<00:03:30.319> crit<00:03:30.620> again<00:03:31.220> on

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
took another shot and he crit again on

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.729 
took another shot and he crit again on
that<00:03:32.030> it<00:03:32.180> he<00:03:32.299> adhesive<00:03:32.780> launcher<00:03:33.079> again<00:03:33.260> the

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
that it he adhesive launcher again the

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.190 
that it he adhesive launcher again the
second<00:03:34.100> time<00:03:34.280> with<00:03:34.819> this<00:03:34.970> guy<00:03:35.180> this<00:03:35.840> little

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
second time with this guy this little

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.990 
second time with this guy this little
guy<00:03:36.319> this<00:03:36.380> is<00:03:36.620> like<00:03:36.709> a<00:03:36.739> 30-point<00:03:37.310> model<00:03:37.730> who<00:03:37.970> is

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
guy this is like a 30-point model who is

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.420 
guy this is like a 30-point model who is
now<00:03:38.269> stuck<00:03:38.660> like<00:03:38.870> over<00:03:39.350> 60<00:03:39.709> or<00:03:39.799> 70<00:03:40.100> points

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
now stuck like over 60 or 70 points

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.340 
now stuck like over 60 or 70 points
worth<00:03:40.549> of<00:03:40.640> my<00:03:40.760> stuff<00:03:41.060> because<00:03:41.959> of<00:03:42.260> the

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
worth of my stuff because of the

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.890 
worth of my stuff because of the
decisions<00:03:42.680> that<00:03:42.829> I<00:03:43.040> made<00:03:43.310> so<00:03:44.090> I<00:03:44.120> opened<00:03:44.750> myself

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
decisions that I made so I opened myself

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.979 
decisions that I made so I opened myself
up<00:03:45.290> to<00:03:45.560> this<00:03:45.799> possibility<00:03:46.100> happening<00:03:47.000> for<00:03:47.720> no

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
up to this possibility happening for no

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.410 
up to this possibility happening for no
great<00:03:48.380> tactical<00:03:48.950> reason<00:03:49.280> and<00:03:49.670> I<00:03:50.120> wanted<00:03:50.299> to

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
great tactical reason and I wanted to

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.610 
great tactical reason and I wanted to
kind<00:03:50.569> of<00:03:50.630> demonstrate<00:03:51.079> that<00:03:51.170> because<00:03:51.350> I<00:03:51.500> think

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
kind of demonstrate that because I think

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.309 
kind of demonstrate that because I think
that's<00:03:51.889> where<00:03:52.510> getting<00:03:53.510> better<00:03:53.690> and<00:03:53.900> infinity

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
that's where getting better and infinity

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.559 
that's where getting better and infinity
really<00:03:54.920> begins<00:03:55.280> it's<00:03:55.880> starting<00:03:56.150> to<00:03:56.239> look<00:03:56.420> at

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
really begins it's starting to look at

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.360 
really begins it's starting to look at
the<00:03:56.660> board<00:03:56.870> and<00:03:57.079> evaluate<00:03:57.650> those<00:03:57.799> decisions

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
the board and evaluate those decisions

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.090 
the board and evaluate those decisions
and<00:03:58.639> realize<00:03:59.450> that<00:03:59.480> yes<00:03:59.959> this<00:04:00.410> is<00:04:00.590> an<00:04:00.709> option

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
and realize that yes this is an option

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.490 
and realize that yes this is an option
that<00:04:01.130> I<00:04:01.250> can<00:04:01.579> take<00:04:01.910> and<00:04:02.180> the<00:04:02.600> risk<00:04:02.840> is<00:04:03.079> fairly

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
that I can take and the risk is fairly

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.039 
that I can take and the risk is fairly
low<00:04:03.829> but<00:04:04.579> what's<00:04:04.819> the<00:04:04.940> reward<00:04:05.150> ultimately<00:04:05.780> and

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
low but what's the reward ultimately and

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:08.410 
low but what's the reward ultimately and
how<00:04:06.470> is<00:04:06.620> it<00:04:06.799> better<00:04:07.040> than<00:04:07.340> just<00:04:07.700> advancing<00:04:08.269> up

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
how is it better than just advancing up

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.449 
how is it better than just advancing up
the<00:04:08.450> board<00:04:08.750> getting<00:04:09.410> more<00:04:09.680> objectives<00:04:10.220> and

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
the board getting more objectives and

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:11.800 
the board getting more objectives and
putting<00:04:10.850> even<00:04:11.000> more<00:04:11.150> pressure<00:04:11.329> on<00:04:11.660> my

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
putting even more pressure on my

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.539 
putting even more pressure on my
opponent<00:04:12.230> second<00:04:12.560> turn<00:04:12.709> so<00:04:13.220> that<00:04:13.310> he<00:04:13.370> doesn't

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
opponent second turn so that he doesn't

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:15.220 
opponent second turn so that he doesn't
have<00:04:13.609> the<00:04:13.730> luxury<00:04:13.910> to<00:04:14.720> place<00:04:14.900> those<00:04:15.079> guys

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
have the luxury to place those guys

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.770 
have the luxury to place those guys
exactly<00:04:15.859> where<00:04:15.980> he<00:04:16.070> wants<00:04:16.310> to<00:04:16.510> so<00:04:17.510> that's<00:04:17.690> the

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
exactly where he wants to so that's the

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.539 
exactly where he wants to so that's the
basis<00:04:18.049> of<00:04:18.109> the<00:04:18.229> thing<00:04:18.410> and<00:04:18.650> the<00:04:19.130> only<00:04:19.340> other

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
basis of the thing and the only other

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.240 
basis of the thing and the only other
thing<00:04:19.639> that<00:04:19.789> all<00:04:20.000> in<00:04:20.150> with<00:04:20.359> is<00:04:20.890> this<00:04:21.890> story<00:04:22.159> is

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
thing that all in with is this story is

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.500 
thing that all in with is this story is
even<00:04:22.310> sadder

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
even sadder

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.080 
even sadder
you<00:04:23.870> thought<00:04:24.080> it<00:04:24.200> was<00:04:24.380> because<00:04:25.130> I've<00:04:25.940> been

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
you thought it was because I've been
