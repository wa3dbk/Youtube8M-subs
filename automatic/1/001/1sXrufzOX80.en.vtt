you<00:06:12.570> see<00:06:12.750> in<00:06:12.900> southern<00:06:13.320> Indiana<00:06:14.040> or<00:06:14.220> Kentucky

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:14.940 
you see in southern Indiana or Kentucky

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.550 
you see in southern Indiana or Kentucky
right<00:06:15.390> and<00:06:15.660> there<00:06:16.020> you<00:06:16.169> know<00:06:16.260> there's<00:06:16.410> some

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
right and there you know there's some

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.020 
right and there you know there's some
places<00:06:16.740> with<00:06:16.980> roots<00:06:17.220> for<00:06:17.370> the<00:06:17.669> most<00:06:17.850> part

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:18.030 
places with roots for the most part

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:19.730 
places with roots for the most part
that's<00:06:18.419> not<00:06:18.630> really<00:06:18.870> a<00:06:18.900> major<00:06:19.110> issue<00:06:19.380> at<00:06:19.650> all

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 
that's not really a major issue at all

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.270 
that's not really a major issue at all
so<00:06:20.130> it's<00:06:20.340> a<00:06:20.580> runnable<00:06:21.360> course<00:06:21.660> and<00:06:22.140> I'm<00:06:23.100> really

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280
