 hey I'm all access alex and are 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:09.540
 the basket crash i'm really good 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.280
 In killing people that's supposed to be barack 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.809
 obama at least last year to his 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.490
 to discuss in a conversation over the 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.199
 drone war have said anyway 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.060
 claim that the journalists marc 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.160
 Author and John Heilemann in their book 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.990
 double down obama this incisive 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.340
 sentence really said or not 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.990
 unanswered the debate over the 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.760
 drone war is through this quote 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.650
 but rekindled since 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.300
 years put the usa remotely controlled 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.279
 fighting drones against islamists and 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.290
 followers of al qaida one concerned 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.360
 Countries include Afghanistan 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.250
 the yemen and pakistan it is appreciated 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.420
 that in such missions already several 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.309
 a thousand people died 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.690
 including many civilians only in the 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.399
 may this year had obama 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.320
 announced the use of combat drones 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.579
 to reduce and regulate more strictly 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.110
 one week ago there was one 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.430
 American drone attack on the 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.980
 dare the taliban leader hakimullah 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.570
 mehsud were doing mesut himself and 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.980
 Four of his employees killed the 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.809
 Action from in the Pakistani 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.609
 tribal region north waziristan city 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.079
 unfavorably were the same day 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.550
 peace negotiations between the 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.739
 Pakistani government and the 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.420
 Taliban leadership had previously stated 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.159
 the Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.260
 Sharif Barack Obama in Washington 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.640
 personally asked the 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.390
 drone attacks temporarily 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.409
 adjust 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.030
 this had the desire but 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.830
 obviously ignored by pages 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.790
 pakistan then said after the attack 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.650
 also that washington the 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.180
 purposely ruin peace efforts 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.610
 Total wanted is the military 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.049
 use of drones since 2011 clearly 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.610
 that is why she is afraid of that 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.560
 armament industry now also immense 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.000
 losses if the military market 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.560
 namely , only the break away remains 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.030
 civilian market for the drone manufacturers 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.740
 Finally, not only will threaten 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.420
 Kill people used to help them 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.680
 also in the education and security 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.720
 from war zones you can to 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.579
 Find example scattering 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.680
 then the soldiers on the ground then warned 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.000
 In addition, threats will often be to 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.409
 surveillance of the civilian space is 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.549
 used more options 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.409
 are for example the 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.149
 forest fire fighting the archaeological 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.530
 research and maintenance of 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.329
 Infrastructure the use of 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.860
 Battle Drones will be in Germany anyway 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.390
 very critically a problem for 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.520
 The civilian use is that it hardly 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.200
 uniform international regulations 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.820
 for drones in aviation is there 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.409
 This can be created for years 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.579
 passing another problem is the 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.069
 lack of social acceptance 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.179
 threaten mostly as killermaschinen 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.950
 or as a threat to the 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.360
 Privacy viewed the German 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.400
 may after the debacle around 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.990
 euro hawk of drones of any kind 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.520
 anyway, first have the nose full 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.930
 this one had hundreds of millions 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.640
 Taxes devoured with the 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.290
 result that the project is discontinued 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.940
 was not and the drone until today 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.980
 is functional in the production 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.320
 smaller models like the tactical and 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.020
 micro-usb it belongs to germany but too 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.910
 the market leaders are called anm and every 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.620
 week and is another name for 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.210
 made a drone for a few weeks 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.220
 a member of the pirate party at one 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.290
 election campaign by angela merkel for 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.480
 Look up by droning a small one 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.040
 right in front of the podium device after flight 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.570
 his own statement he wanted the chancellor 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.640
 show how it is under 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.390
 observation has the nsa 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.390
 but got better 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.989
 you should use the use of combat drones 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.700
 in war zones for moral 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.050
 acceptable and what do you think about that 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.670
 use of drones in the civilian area 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.600
