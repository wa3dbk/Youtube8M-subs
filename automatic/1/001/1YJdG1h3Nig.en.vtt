of Duty and Activision so pretty much

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:36.970 
of Duty and Activision so pretty much

the PlayStation 4 and the PlayStation 3

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.550 
the PlayStation 4 and the PlayStation 3
now<00:00:43.520> the<00:00:43.610> problem<00:00:44.120> here<00:00:44.150> is<00:00:44.510> I<00:00:44.720> really<00:00:45.320> don't

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:45.560 
now the problem here is I really don't

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.920 
now the problem here is I really don't
think<00:00:45.650> that<00:00:46.010> the<00:00:46.130> black<00:00:46.310> ops<00:00:46.610> 3<00:00:46.970> beta<00:00:47.180> is<00:00:47.570> going

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
think that the black ops 3 beta is going

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.860 
think that the black ops 3 beta is going
to<00:00:48.050> start<00:00:48.380> one<00:00:48.800> month<00:00:49.160> later<00:00:49.489> on<00:00:49.880> the<00:00:50.090> Xbox<00:00:50.540> one

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
to start one month later on the Xbox one

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.530 
to start one month later on the Xbox one
and<00:00:51.170> the<00:00:51.350> PC<00:00:51.860> I<00:00:52.070> think<00:00:52.670> it's<00:00:52.820> going<00:00:53.090> to<00:00:53.149> be<00:00:53.300> very

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
and the PC I think it's going to be very

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.350 
and the PC I think it's going to be very
similar<00:00:53.989> to<00:00:54.340> Destiny's<00:00:55.340> beta<00:00:55.760> so<00:00:55.940> pretty<00:00:56.180> much

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
similar to Destiny's beta so pretty much

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.350 
similar to Destiny's beta so pretty much
it's<00:00:56.989> gonna<00:00:57.230> start<00:00:57.710> on<00:00:57.920> the<00:00:58.460> PlayStation<00:00:59.210> and

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
it's gonna start on the PlayStation and

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.860 
it's gonna start on the PlayStation and
then<00:01:00.170> one<00:01:00.680> week<00:01:00.950> later<00:01:00.980> it<00:01:01.969> will<00:01:02.180> start<00:01:02.570> on<00:01:02.750> the

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
then one week later it will start on the

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.800 
then one week later it will start on the
Xbox<00:01:03.350> one<00:01:03.500> and<00:01:03.950> the<00:01:04.129> PC<00:01:04.670> alright<00:01:05.540> so<00:01:05.659> let's

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
Xbox one and the PC alright so let's

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.780 
Xbox one and the PC alright so let's
just<00:01:05.840> go<00:01:06.049> ahead<00:01:06.079> and<00:01:06.590> jump<00:01:06.950> right<00:01:07.159> into<00:01:07.430> this

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
just go ahead and jump right into this

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.050 
just go ahead and jump right into this
so<00:01:08.119> the<00:01:08.509> black<00:01:08.750> ops<00:01:09.020> 3<00:01:09.350> beta<00:01:09.619> will<00:01:10.369> start<00:01:10.850> on

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
so the black ops 3 beta will start on

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.010 
so the black ops 3 beta will start on
August<00:01:11.540> 19th<00:01:12.290> and<00:01:12.560> that<00:01:12.890> is<00:01:13.310> a<00:01:13.639> Wednesday<00:01:14.450> on

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
August 19th and that is a Wednesday on

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.219 
August 19th and that is a Wednesday on
PlayStation<00:01:15.829> 4<00:01:15.859> and<00:01:16.429> then<00:01:16.999> one<00:01:17.479> week<00:01:17.749> later<00:01:18.079> I

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
PlayStation 4 and then one week later I

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.190 
PlayStation 4 and then one week later I
think<00:01:18.439> it<00:01:18.799> will<00:01:18.889> start<00:01:19.249> on<00:01:19.520> Xbox<00:01:20.329> one<00:01:20.479> and<00:01:20.899> PC

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
think it will start on Xbox one and PC

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.800 
think it will start on Xbox one and PC
so<00:01:22.039> I<00:01:22.069> think<00:01:22.579> it's<00:01:22.700> either<00:01:22.819> going<00:01:23.090> to<00:01:23.299> start<00:01:23.630> on

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
so I think it's either going to start on

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.959 
so I think it's either going to start on
Tuesday<00:01:24.289> August<00:01:24.770> 25th<00:01:25.670> or<00:01:26.259> Wednesday<00:01:27.259> August

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:27.969 
Tuesday August 25th or Wednesday August

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:33.160 
Tuesday August 25th or Wednesday August
26<00:01:28.969> on<00:01:29.359> at<00:01:29.630> the<00:01:29.749> Xbox<00:01:30.170> one<00:01:30.469> and<00:01:30.679> the<00:01:31.369> PC<00:01:32.119> now<00:01:32.749> if

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
26 on at the Xbox one and the PC now if

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.840

say it's probably going to be Tuesday

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.160 
say it's probably going to be Tuesday
August<00:01:39.049> 25th<00:01:39.979> just<00:01:40.909> because<00:01:41.299> most<00:01:41.659> stuff<00:01:41.990> for

Call<00:01:42.349> of<00:01:42.380> Duty<00:01:42.799> on<00:01:43.009> Xbox<00:01:43.819> is<00:01:44.029> always<00:01:44.659> released

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
Call of Duty on Xbox is always released

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.249 
Call of Duty on Xbox is always released
on<00:01:45.859> a<00:01:45.889> Tuesday<00:01:46.700> now<00:01:47.389> I<00:01:47.420> hate<00:01:47.719> to<00:01:47.869> say<00:01:48.049> this

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
on a Tuesday now I hate to say this

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.199 
on a Tuesday now I hate to say this
guy's<00:01:48.439> but<00:01:48.469> there<00:01:48.920> is<00:01:49.099> the<00:01:49.399> possibility<00:01:49.579> that

00:01:50.199 --> 00:01:50.209 
guy's but there is the possibility that

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:54.010 
guy's but there is the possibility that
it<00:01:50.569> could<00:01:50.840> come<00:01:51.170> out<00:01:51.319> 30<00:01:51.979> days<00:01:52.130> later<00:01:52.759> on<00:01:53.149> the

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
it could come out 30 days later on the

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.260 
it could come out 30 days later on the
Xbox<00:01:54.469> one<00:01:54.799> and<00:01:55.099> the<00:01:55.789> PC<00:01:56.659> now<00:01:56.919> I<00:01:57.919> would<00:01:58.549> say<00:01:58.819> this

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
Xbox one and the PC now I would say this

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.629 
Xbox one and the PC now I would say this
is<00:01:59.450> very<00:01:59.749> slim<00:02:00.289> it's<00:02:00.499> probably<00:02:01.039> not<00:02:01.219> going<00:02:01.429> to

00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:01.639 
is very slim it's probably not going to

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:03.849 
is very slim it's probably not going to
happen<00:02:01.939> but<00:02:02.090> if<00:02:02.240> it<00:02:02.419> does<00:02:02.689> happen<00:02:02.719> I<00:02:03.319> would

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:03.859 
happen but if it does happen I would

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:05.499 
happen but if it does happen I would
think<00:02:04.039> it's<00:02:04.249> either<00:02:04.490> going<00:02:04.729> to<00:02:04.849> come<00:02:05.119> out<00:02:05.299> on

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
think it's either going to come out on
