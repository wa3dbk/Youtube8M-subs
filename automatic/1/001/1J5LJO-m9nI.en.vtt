a bit in the back offers so much
information<00:00:27.300> is<00:00:27.689> gathered<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.080> when<00:00:28.529> we

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
information is gathered and when we

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.710 
information is gathered and when we
interpret<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:29.429> accurately<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.210> we<00:00:30.539> use

information

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.200 

are<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.720> tests<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.140> we<00:01:46.260> do<00:01:46.410> do<00:01:46.640> we<00:01:47.640> have

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
are the tests that we do do we have

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.390 
are the tests that we do do we have
players<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.570> start<00:01:48.960> at<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.350> accept<00:01:49.860> 8<00:01:50.070> years

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
players that start at I accept 8 years

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.920 
players that start at I accept 8 years
old<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.790> that's<00:01:51.090> before<00:01:51.300> they've<00:01:51.690> hit

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
old and that's before they've hit

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.230 
old and that's before they've hit
puberty<00:01:52.110> or<00:01:52.350> what<00:01:53.010> we<00:01:53.190> turn<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.580> growth<00:01:53.850> spurt

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
puberty or what we turn the growth spurt

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
puberty or what we turn the growth spurt
so<00:01:55.020> we<00:01:55.140> measure<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.890> markers<00:01:56.850> or<00:01:57.260> indicators

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
so we measure and markers or indicators

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.170 
so we measure and markers or indicators
that<00:01:58.290> will<00:01:58.620> tell<00:01:58.800> us<00:01:58.830> when<00:01:59.160> is<00:01:59.310> an<00:01:59.400> athlete<00:01:59.760> in

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
that will tell us when is an athlete in

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.000 
that will tell us when is an athlete in
his<00:02:00.570> growth<00:02:00.810> spurt<00:02:01.140> which<00:02:01.440> means<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.830> is

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
his growth spurt which means that is

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.770 
his growth spurt which means that is
growing<00:02:02.400> the<00:02:02.520> most<00:02:02.760> and<00:02:03.090> Viserys

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
growing the most and Viserys

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.560 
growing the most and Viserys
coordination<00:02:04.530> will<00:02:04.650> be<00:02:04.800> out<00:02:05.760> and<00:02:06.150> we<00:02:06.420> can

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
coordination will be out and we can

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.139 
coordination will be out and we can
