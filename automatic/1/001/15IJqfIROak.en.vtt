00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
the cards off the table and then back on

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.530 
the cards off the table and then back on
here<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:34.760> except<00:00:35.760> for<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:35.940> top<00:00:36.149> left<00:00:36.390> one

here and except for that top left one
that's<00:00:37.200> actually<00:00:37.790> here's<00:00:38.790> another<00:00:39.059> piece<00:00:39.270> a

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
that's actually here's another piece a

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.389 
that's actually here's another piece a
return<00:00:39.750> they've<00:00:40.350> been<00:00:40.559> on<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.860> ball<00:00:41.040> I've<00:00:41.219> got

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
return they've been on the ball I've got

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.459 
return they've been on the ball I've got
like<00:00:41.550> three<00:00:41.790> returns<00:00:42.090> back<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.570> this<00:00:42.690> past<00:00:42.989> two

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
like three returns back in this past two

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.069 
like three returns back in this past two
weeks<00:00:43.969> I'm<00:00:44.969> probably<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.360> PS<00:00:45.629> they<00:00:45.780> returned

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
weeks I'm probably the PS they returned

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.389 
weeks I'm probably the PS they returned
first<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.559> then<00:00:46.649> I'll<00:00:46.770> start<00:00:46.980> in<00:00:47.129> on<00:00:47.250> that

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
first and then I'll start in on that

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.639 
first and then I'll start in on that
series<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:48.600> those<00:00:48.840> eight<00:00:49.050> boxes<00:00:49.469> that's

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
series in those eight boxes that's

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:50.959 
series in those eight boxes that's
probably<00:00:49.920> only<00:00:50.039> half<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.460> what's<00:00:50.610> coming<00:00:50.789> in

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
probably only half of what's coming in

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.150 
probably only half of what's coming in
but<00:00:51.809> I'm<00:00:52.079> going<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.289> show<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:52.949> video

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
but I'm going to show you in this video

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.180 
but I'm going to show you in this video

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
Mach packs now if you look this looks

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.190 
Mach packs now if you look this looks
really<00:01:07.950> similar<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.640> blister<00:01:11.990> but<00:01:12.990> it's

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
really similar to a blister but it's

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.600 
really similar to a blister but it's
actually<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.619> mean<00:01:13.799> it's<00:01:13.950> not<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.159> don't<00:01:14.460> know<00:01:14.549> if

actually I mean it's not I don't know if
you<00:01:14.729> can<00:01:14.880> tell<00:01:15.060> but<00:01:15.119> it's<00:01:15.360> kind<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.020> different

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
you can tell but it's kind of different

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.950 
you can tell but it's kind of different
fabric<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.159> haven't<00:01:17.700> examined<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.750> back

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
fabric to it I haven't examined the back

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.249 
fabric to it I haven't examined the back

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
to see if it's exactly like the other

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.350 
to see if it's exactly like the other
one<00:01:22.470> is<00:01:22.799> definitely<00:01:23.280> not<00:01:23.400> in<00:01:23.549> color<00:01:23.759> I'm<00:01:24.119> sure

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
was in color you see from the side it's

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.550 
was in color you see from the side it's
uh<00:01:32.369> it's<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.820> different<00:01:33.180> type<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.329> material<00:01:33.960> and

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
uh it's a different type of material and

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.069 
uh it's a different type of material and
the<00:01:35.189> packs<00:01:35.460> they<00:01:35.880> may<00:01:36.030> look<00:01:36.299> exactly<00:01:36.689> like<00:01:36.930> a

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
the packs they may look exactly like a

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.380 
the packs they may look exactly like a
real<00:01:37.290> pack<00:01:37.530> but<00:01:37.799> they're<00:01:38.040> not<00:01:38.159> select<00:01:38.670> this<00:01:39.240> is

then the next Mach pack that I'm going

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.760 
then the next Mach pack that I'm going
to<00:01:47.520> show<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.720> was<00:01:48.720> actually<00:01:48.990> something<00:01:49.619> that

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
to show you was actually something that

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.679 
to show you was actually something that
was<00:01:49.950> presented<00:01:50.280> by<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.700> design<00:01:51.240> team<00:01:51.540> and

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
was presented by the design team and

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.899 
was presented by the design team and
then<00:01:52.500> when<00:01:52.799> they<00:01:52.890> presented<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.490> if<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.759> was

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
then when they presented it if it was

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.219 
then when they presented it if it was
approved<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.570> went<00:01:54.780> straight<00:01:55.079> into

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
approved it went straight into

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.100 
approved it went straight into
production<00:01:55.700> and<00:01:56.700> as<00:01:56.850> we<00:01:57.000> know<00:01:57.180> from<00:01:57.899> looking

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
production and as we know from looking

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.319 
production and as we know from looking
at<00:01:58.380> this<00:01:58.619> pack<00:01:58.860> in<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.159> pack<00:01:59.430> this<00:02:00.090> was

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
at this pack in that pack this was

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.080 
at this pack in that pack this was
actually<00:02:00.540> an<00:02:00.869> approved<00:02:01.259> design<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:02.159> what's

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
actually an approved design and what's

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.959 
actually an approved design and what's
pretty<00:02:03.719> cool<00:02:03.780> about<00:02:04.020> these<00:02:04.290> is<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.740> can<00:02:05.040> throw

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
pretty cool about these is you can throw

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.580 
pretty cool about these is you can throw
here<00:02:06.149> this<00:02:06.270> isn't<00:02:06.570> just<00:02:07.020> like<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.140> wrapping

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
here this isn't just like a wrapping

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.410 
here this isn't just like a wrapping
around<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:08.160> real<00:02:08.369> pack<00:02:08.580> there<00:02:08.789> is<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:09.030> real<00:02:09.239> pack

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
around a real pack there is a real pack

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.360 
around a real pack there is a real pack
in<00:02:09.599> here<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:09.929> don't<00:02:10.379> this<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:11.129> just<00:02:11.280> the

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
in here I don't this is just the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.530 
in here I don't this is just the
wrapping<00:02:11.550> that<00:02:11.790> goes<00:02:11.910> around<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.360> on<00:02:12.450> the

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
wrapping that goes around it on the

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.960 
wrapping that goes around it on the
outside

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
outside

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.440 
outside
there's<00:02:13.180> one<00:02:13.300> over<00:02:13.330> here<00:02:13.510> too<00:02:14.820> it<00:02:15.820> may<00:02:16.000> be<00:02:16.060> hard

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
there's one over here too it may be hard

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.830 
there's one over here too it may be hard
to<00:02:16.570> tell<00:02:17.490> but<00:02:18.490> that's<00:02:18.850> actually<00:02:19.180> a<00:02:19.240> Magic<00:02:19.690> the

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
to tell but that's actually a Magic the

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.440 
to tell but that's actually a Magic the
Gathering<00:02:19.870> pack<00:02:20.500> in<00:02:20.860> that<00:02:21.100> one<00:02:21.310> and<00:02:22.090> then<00:02:22.210> over

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
Gathering pack in that one and then over

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.860 
Gathering pack in that one and then over
here<00:02:22.480> it<00:02:23.350> looks<00:02:23.530> like<00:02:23.590> a<00:02:23.680> jungle<00:02:24.070> pack<00:02:24.870> now

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
here it looks like a jungle pack now

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.600 
here it looks like a jungle pack now
there's<00:02:26.080> I've<00:02:26.800> actually<00:02:27.040> tried<00:02:27.280> getting

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
there's I've actually tried getting

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.720 
there's I've actually tried getting
these<00:02:27.760> out<00:02:27.940> and<00:02:28.180> they<00:02:28.600> don't<00:02:28.780> come<00:02:28.960> out<00:02:28.990> but

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
these out and they don't come out but

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.310 
these out and they don't come out but
well<00:02:30.730> I'm<00:02:31.420> sure<00:02:31.630> they<00:02:31.750> would<00:02:31.930> if<00:02:32.020> I<00:02:32.110> rip

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
well I'm sure they would if I rip

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.300 
well I'm sure they would if I rip
something<00:02:32.620> up<00:02:32.710> but<00:02:32.800> I<00:02:32.890> wouldn't<00:02:33.070> want<00:02:33.190> to<00:02:33.220> take

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
something up but I wouldn't want to take

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.010 
something up but I wouldn't want to take
them<00:02:33.490> out<00:02:33.550> anyways<00:02:33.940> because<00:02:34.060> I<00:02:34.210> like<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.840> fact

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
them out anyways because I like the fact

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.360 
them out anyways because I like the fact
that<00:02:35.110> they're<00:02:35.320> in<00:02:35.470> there<00:02:35.680> in<00:02:35.920> this<00:02:36.100> little

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
that they're in there in this little

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.140 
that they're in there in this little
display<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:38.730> actually<00:02:39.730> come<00:02:39.910> with<00:02:40.060> the

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
display and actually come with the

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.730 
display and actually come with the
little<00:02:40.360> plastic<00:02:40.720> piece<00:02:40.960> that<00:02:41.290> went<00:02:41.440> over<00:02:41.560> it

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
little plastic piece that went over it

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:42.450 
little plastic piece that went over it
like<00:02:41.920> that

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
like that

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.950 
like that
so<00:02:42.970> I'm<00:02:43.030> guessing<00:02:43.330> they<00:02:43.420> punched<00:02:43.690> a<00:02:43.780> hole<00:02:43.930> in

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
so I'm guessing they punched a hole in

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.840 
so I'm guessing they punched a hole in
up<00:02:44.290> top<00:02:44.470> right<00:02:44.650> there<00:02:44.800> put<00:02:45.040> it<00:02:45.130> on<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.280> hanger

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.310 

so<00:02:48.850> even<00:02:49.090> though<00:02:49.180> this<00:02:49.360> one<00:02:49.570> was<00:02:49.810> an<00:02:49.990> approved

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
so even though this one was an approved

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.250 
so even though this one was an approved
copy<00:02:50.620> because<00:02:51.130> it<00:02:51.910> looks<00:02:52.090> exactly<00:02:52.270> like<00:02:52.720> the

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
copy because it looks exactly like the

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.949 
copy because it looks exactly like the
actual<00:02:53.590> pack<00:02:53.920> that<00:02:54.190> was<00:02:54.400> approved<00:02:55.150> but<00:02:55.870> of

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
actual pack that was approved but of

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.840 
actual pack that was approved but of
course<00:02:56.170> this<00:02:56.350> is<00:02:56.530> a<00:02:56.560> a<00:02:56.830> wrapper<00:02:57.280> instead<00:02:57.730> of

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
course this is a a wrapper instead of

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.160 
course this is a a wrapper instead of
just<00:02:58.090> something<00:02:58.360> that<00:02:58.390> was<00:02:58.540> probably<00:02:58.720> printed

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
just something that was probably printed

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.170 
just something that was probably printed
out<00:02:59.290> with<00:03:00.100> I<00:03:00.220> think<00:03:00.430> he<00:03:00.520> said<00:03:00.730> they<00:03:00.850> used<00:03:01.060> to

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
out with I think he said they used to

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.410 
out with I think he said they used to
photoshop<00:03:01.690> back<00:03:01.930> then<00:03:02.970> so<00:03:03.970> I'm<00:03:04.060> gonna<00:03:04.180> set

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
photoshop back then so I'm gonna set

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.150 
photoshop back then so I'm gonna set
this<00:03:04.570> one<00:03:04.750> up<00:03:04.810> in<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:05.500> background

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
this one up in the background

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.520 
this one up in the background
hopefully<00:03:06.790> it<00:03:06.850> stays<00:03:07.150> right<00:03:07.540> there<00:03:07.780> and<00:03:07.990> then

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
hopefully it stays right there and then

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:15.210 
hopefully it stays right there and then
the<00:03:08.680> next<00:03:08.709> one<00:03:09.160> this<00:03:09.700> one's<00:03:09.940> really<00:03:10.209> cool<00:03:14.220> this

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
the next one this one's really cool this

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.240 
the next one this one's really cool this
is<00:03:15.280> a<00:03:15.430> little<00:03:15.730> bit<00:03:15.850> older<00:03:16.209> Mach<00:03:16.450> pack<00:03:17.130> if<00:03:18.130> you

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
is a little bit older Mach pack if you

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.590 
is a little bit older Mach pack if you
go<00:03:18.340> to<00:03:18.400> the<00:03:18.550> top<00:03:18.760> you<00:03:18.790> can<00:03:19.000> see<00:03:19.269> where<00:03:19.420> it<00:03:19.510> says

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
go to the top you can see where it says

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.540 
go to the top you can see where it says
can<00:03:19.900> you<00:03:19.989> catch<00:03:20.260> all<00:03:20.530> the<00:03:21.340> jungle<00:03:21.880> cards<00:03:23.550> and

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
can you catch all the jungle cards and

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.150 
can you catch all the jungle cards and
then<00:03:24.760> you'll<00:03:24.880> find<00:03:25.120> 48<00:03:25.600> new<00:03:25.750> Pokemon<00:03:26.290> and<00:03:26.590> so

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
then you'll find 48 new Pokemon and so

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.949 
then you'll find 48 new Pokemon and so
forth<00:03:27.430> and<00:03:27.610> reads<00:03:28.269> all<00:03:28.390> the<00:03:28.480> way<00:03:28.570> down<00:03:28.720> through

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
forth and reads all the way down through

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.710 
forth and reads all the way down through
there<00:03:29.170> again<00:03:29.970> it's<00:03:30.970> not<00:03:31.120> in<00:03:31.239> color<00:03:31.420> on<00:03:31.630> the

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
there again it's not in color on the

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.390 
there again it's not in color on the
back<00:03:32.430> you<00:03:33.430> can<00:03:33.459> see<00:03:34.530> like<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.739> material<00:03:36.250> is

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
back you can see like the material is

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.910 
back you can see like the material is
definitely<00:03:36.820> not<00:03:36.989> what<00:03:37.989> you<00:03:38.140> see<00:03:38.350> you<00:03:38.620> know<00:03:38.739> in

the three cover arsons as you can see

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.710 
the three cover arsons as you can see
this<00:04:00.350> is<00:04:00.500> a<00:04:00.530> Jolteon<00:04:01.120> what's<00:04:02.120> even<00:04:02.390> cooler<00:04:02.570> I

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
this is a Jolteon what's even cooler I

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
the bottom just like the first edition

base<00:04:10.490> at<00:04:10.700> PAX<00:04:10.970> which<00:04:11.300> we<00:04:11.660> all<00:04:11.780> know<00:04:11.930> was

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
base at PAX which we all know was

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.490 
base at PAX which we all know was
changed<00:04:12.650> over<00:04:12.950> as<00:04:13.250> soon<00:04:13.490> as<00:04:13.550> the<00:04:13.730> first

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
changed over as soon as the first

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.780 
changed over as soon as the first
shadowless<00:04:15.500> print<00:04:15.800> run<00:04:15.980> was<00:04:16.010> completely<00:04:16.610> done

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
shadowless print run was completely done

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.090 
shadowless print run was completely done
well<00:04:17.269> I'm<00:04:17.360> not<00:04:17.540> it<00:04:17.690> was<00:04:17.900> change<00:04:18.110> over<00:04:18.290> during

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
well I'm not it was change over during

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.280 
well I'm not it was change over during
that<00:04:19.250> print<00:04:19.489> runners<00:04:19.870> right<00:04:20.870> after<00:04:21.230> it

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
that print runners right after it

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:22.480 
that print runners right after it
because<00:04:21.530> you<00:04:21.680> know<00:04:21.799> some<00:04:22.010> of<00:04:22.100> the<00:04:22.160> shadowless

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
because you know some of the shadowless

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.050 
because you know some of the shadowless
cards<00:04:23.200> were<00:04:24.200> some<00:04:24.440> of<00:04:24.530> the<00:04:24.620> shallows<00:04:25.060> print

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
cards were some of the shallows print

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.330 
cards were some of the shallows print
packs<00:04:26.390> had<00:04:26.870> regular<00:04:27.470> shadow<00:04:27.680> cards<00:04:28.040> in<00:04:28.130> it<00:04:28.220> so

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
packs had regular shadow cards in it so

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.820 
packs had regular shadow cards in it so
probably<00:04:28.850> a<00:04:29.090> little<00:04:29.840> bit<00:04:30.020> after<00:04:30.170> the<00:04:30.440> shadows

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
probably a little bit after the shadows

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.270 
probably a little bit after the shadows
print<00:04:31.420> run<00:04:32.420> but<00:04:33.260> so<00:04:33.530> that<00:04:33.680> means<00:04:33.830> this<00:04:33.980> was<00:04:34.160> in

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
print run but so that means this was in

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.700 
print run but so that means this was in
the<00:04:34.370> making<00:04:34.580> during<00:04:35.180> the<00:04:35.600> very<00:04:35.840> first<00:04:35.990> part<00:04:36.560> of

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
the making during the very first part of

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.880 
the making during the very first part of
the<00:04:36.800> base<00:04:36.980> set<00:04:37.280> and<00:04:38.080> of<00:04:39.080> course<00:04:39.440> it<00:04:39.560> was<00:04:39.740> not

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:39.890 
the base set and of course it was not

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:44.350 
the base set and of course it was not
approved<00:04:40.780> but<00:04:41.920> what's<00:04:42.920> in<00:04:43.100> here<00:04:43.400> from<00:04:44.150> what<00:04:44.330> I

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
approved but what's in here from what I

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.210 
approved but what's in here from what I
can<00:04:44.480> make<00:04:44.660> out<00:04:45.020> it's<00:04:45.320> actually<00:04:45.470> like<00:04:45.800> a<00:04:45.830> base

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
can make out it's actually like a base

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.870 
can make out it's actually like a base
set<00:04:46.490> pack<00:04:46.790> in<00:04:47.030> there<00:04:47.210> I<00:04:47.390> don't<00:04:48.200> know<00:04:48.410> what<00:04:49.400> set

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
set pack in there I don't know what set

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.970 
set pack in there I don't know what set
or<00:04:50.150> like<00:04:50.360> if<00:04:50.510> its<00:04:50.690> first<00:04:51.050> edition<00:04:51.290> or<00:04:51.680> shadows

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
or like if its first edition or shadows

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.650 
or like if its first edition or shadows
or<00:04:52.160> anything<00:04:52.340> like<00:04:52.970> you<00:04:53.180> probably<00:04:53.330> can't<00:04:53.600> even

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
or anything like you probably can't even

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.659 
or anything like you probably can't even
see<00:04:53.810> so<00:04:54.410> your<00:04:54.560> tell<00:04:54.740> what<00:04:54.919> it<00:04:55.010> is<00:04:55.130> from<00:04:55.400> the

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669 
see so your tell what it is from the

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:57.790 
see so your tell what it is from the
video<00:04:55.970> you<00:04:56.600> can<00:04:56.630> probably<00:04:57.140> see<00:04:57.440> a<00:04:57.470> little<00:04:57.620> bit

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
video you can probably see a little bit

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.840 
video you can probably see a little bit
of<00:04:57.980> the<00:04:58.070> yellow<00:04:58.250> on<00:04:58.669> the<00:04:58.850> bottom<00:04:59.180> right<00:04:59.330> there

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
of the yellow on the bottom right there

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.370 
of the yellow on the bottom right there
but<00:05:01.850> I'm<00:05:01.940> almost<00:05:02.150> positive<00:05:02.330> this<00:05:02.810> a<00:05:02.840> base<00:05:03.140> set

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
but I'm almost positive this a base set

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.470 
but I'm almost positive this a base set
packing<00:05:03.770> here<00:05:03.980> and<00:05:04.160> if<00:05:04.669> I<00:05:04.820> were<00:05:04.940> to<00:05:05.000> guess<00:05:05.240> this

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.480 
packing here and if I were to guess this

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.440 
packing here and if I were to guess this
is<00:05:05.630> gonna<00:05:05.750> be<00:05:05.930> a<00:05:05.960> first<00:05:06.260> edition<00:05:06.530> or<00:05:07.450> maybe

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
is gonna be a first edition or maybe

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.240 
is gonna be a first edition or maybe
even<00:05:08.570> unlimited<00:05:09.200> just<00:05:09.380> regular<00:05:09.830> shadow<00:05:10.070> the

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
even unlimited just regular shadow the

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:16.510 
even unlimited just regular shadow the
space<00:05:10.460> that<00:05:10.669> pack<00:05:12.130> but<00:05:13.130> um<00:05:15.340> other<00:05:16.340> than<00:05:16.400> that

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
space that pack but um other than that

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.850 
space that pack but um other than that
I'm<00:05:16.730> not<00:05:17.110> too<00:05:18.110> sure<00:05:18.260> there's<00:05:18.470> much<00:05:18.650> more

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
I'm not too sure there's much more

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.190 
I'm not too sure there's much more
information<00:05:19.100> out<00:05:19.550> out<00:05:19.820> there<00:05:20.030> on<00:05:20.180> it<00:05:20.210> I<00:05:20.510> think

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
information out out there on it I think

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.540 
information out out there on it I think
it's<00:05:21.470> really<00:05:21.650> cool<00:05:21.860> cuz<00:05:22.010> I<00:05:22.040> mean<00:05:22.190> it<00:05:22.250> is<00:05:22.370> one<00:05:22.490> of

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
it's really cool cuz I mean it is one of

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.010 
it's really cool cuz I mean it is one of
the<00:05:22.640> original<00:05:22.700> blisters<00:05:23.330> and<00:05:23.360> it's<00:05:23.780> still

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
the original blisters and it's still

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.380 
the original blisters and it's still
attached<00:05:24.350> very<00:05:24.740> well<00:05:24.980> most<00:05:25.880> of<00:05:26.000> the<00:05:26.090> blizzards

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
attached very well most of the blizzards

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.000 
attached very well most of the blizzards
from<00:05:26.540> that<00:05:26.660> time<00:05:26.870> didn't<00:05:27.470> even<00:05:27.560> manage<00:05:27.770> this

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.010 
from that time didn't even manage this

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:29.409 
from that time didn't even manage this
farm<00:05:28.250> it<00:05:28.400> does<00:05:28.580> have<00:05:28.760> some<00:05:28.910> tape<00:05:29.150> right<00:05:29.360> here

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
farm it does have some tape right here

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:34.150 
farm it does have some tape right here
from<00:05:29.720> where<00:05:29.750> they<00:05:30.050> used<00:05:30.290> it<00:05:30.470> but<00:05:30.980> uh<00:05:33.160> looks

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 
from where they used it but uh looks

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.800 
from where they used it but uh looks
like<00:05:34.250> cheap<00:05:34.610> tape<00:05:34.910> on<00:05:35.120> something<00:05:35.480> I<00:05:35.510> figured

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
like cheap tape on something I figured

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.470 
like cheap tape on something I figured
it<00:05:35.870> would<00:05:35.960> have<00:05:36.050> come<00:05:36.200> off<00:05:37.120> but<00:05:38.120> this<00:05:38.270> was

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:38.480 
it would have come off but this was

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.230 
it would have come off but this was
saved<00:05:38.690> by<00:05:38.930> the<00:05:38.990> the<00:05:39.710> designer<00:05:40.100> that<00:05:40.400> brought

I'm<00:06:05.720> just<00:06:05.930> gonna<00:06:06.110> go<00:06:07.030> slowly<00:06:08.030> over<00:06:08.420> the<00:06:08.450> entire

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 
I'm just gonna go slowly over the entire

I'm just gonna go slowly over the entire
front<00:06:09.230> of<00:06:09.290> it<00:06:09.440> and<00:06:09.740> the<00:06:10.370> back<00:06:10.840> so<00:06:11.840> that<00:06:11.870> anyone

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:12.320 
front of it and the back so that anyone

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:18.160 
front of it and the back so that anyone
who's<00:06:12.470> looking<00:06:12.830> at<00:06:13.010> this<00:06:16.810> and<00:06:17.810> they<00:06:17.900> see

who's looking at this and they see
something<00:06:18.620> that<00:06:18.740> I<00:06:18.770> missed<00:06:19.160> that<00:06:19.400> would<00:06:19.730> be

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 
something that I missed that would be

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.980 
something that I missed that would be
good<00:06:20.210> for<00:06:20.390> the<00:06:20.510> football<00:06:21.200> world<00:06:21.410> to<00:06:21.560> know

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990 
good for the football world to know

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:37.790 
good for the football world to know
could<00:06:23.990> maybe<00:06:24.140> share<00:06:24.410> it

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.700 

which<00:06:38.520> we<00:06:38.669> also<00:06:38.900> assist<00:06:39.900> in<00:06:40.139> tradable<00:06:40.560> game

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:40.710 
which we also assist in tradable game

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:41.869 
which we also assist in tradable game
cards<00:06:41.039> I<00:06:41.129> guess<00:06:41.250> that<00:06:41.460> was<00:06:41.580> something<00:06:41.849> that

00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:41.879 
cards I guess that was something that

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:43.999 
cards I guess that was something that
they<00:06:42.120> were<00:06:42.180> experimenting<00:06:43.169> with<00:06:43.379> doing<00:06:43.650> and

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:44.009 
they were experimenting with doing and

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:45.170 
they were experimenting with doing and
of<00:06:44.099> course<00:06:44.340> we<00:06:44.490> know<00:06:44.639> that<00:06:44.669> didn't<00:06:45.150> happen

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180 
of course we know that didn't happen

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.649 
of course we know that didn't happen
because<00:06:46.080> all<00:06:46.590> that<00:06:47.520> mean<00:06:47.759> the<00:06:47.879> jungle<00:06:48.180> had<00:06:48.300> 11

00:06:48.649 --> 00:06:48.659 
because all that mean the jungle had 11

00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:51.499 
because all that mean the jungle had 11
cards<00:06:48.900> per<00:06:49.050> pack<00:06:49.289> just<00:06:49.500> like<00:06:50.210> you<00:06:51.210> know<00:06:51.300> base

00:06:51.499 --> 00:06:51.509 
cards per pack just like you know base

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:55.490 
cards per pack just like you know base
set<00:06:51.780> and<00:06:51.990> was<00:06:52.680> fossil<00:06:53.069> did<00:06:53.220> thereafter<00:06:54.500> maybe

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:55.500 
set and was fossil did thereafter maybe

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.529 
set and was fossil did thereafter maybe
that<00:06:55.650> was<00:06:55.800> for<00:06:55.979> money<00:06:56.490> or<00:06:56.669> whatever<00:06:56.940> but<00:06:57.479> I

00:06:57.529 --> 00:06:57.539 
that was for money or whatever but I

00:06:57.539 --> 00:06:59.570 
that was for money or whatever but I
mean<00:06:57.810> I<00:06:57.930> was<00:06:58.020> told<00:06:58.259> during<00:06:58.830> this<00:06:59.159> time<00:06:59.430> when

00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.580 
mean I was told during this time when

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.040 
mean I was told during this time when
they<00:06:59.729> were<00:06:59.789> transitioning<00:07:00.780> from<00:07:00.900> the

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.050 
they were transitioning from the

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.290 
they were transitioning from the
shadowless<00:07:01.470> to<00:07:01.710> the<00:07:01.830> unlimited<00:07:02.759> that<00:07:03.150> they

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:03.300 
shadowless to the unlimited that they

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.700 
shadowless to the unlimited that they
actually<00:07:03.389> went<00:07:03.659> back<00:07:03.840> and<00:07:04.080> printed<00:07:04.409> another

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:04.710 
actually went back and printed another

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:09.290 
actually went back and printed another
first<00:07:05.069> edition<00:07:05.580> run<00:07:06.419> a<00:07:06.449> base<00:07:06.840> set<00:07:08.270> because<00:07:09.270> of

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:09.300 
first edition run a base set because of

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.330 
first edition run a base set because of
money<00:07:09.599> so<00:07:09.870> I<00:07:09.900> mean<00:07:10.110> I<00:07:10.199> can<00:07:10.349> see<00:07:10.530> there<00:07:11.009> why<00:07:11.159> they

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:11.340 
money so I mean I can see there why they

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.330 
money so I mean I can see there why they
would<00:07:11.460> be<00:07:11.550> going<00:07:11.789> to<00:07:11.970> ten<00:07:12.180> cards<00:07:12.889> at<00:07:13.889> that<00:07:14.099> time

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:14.340 
would be going to ten cards at that time

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:18.800 
would be going to ten cards at that time
or<00:07:14.580> they<00:07:14.669> were<00:07:14.729> thinking<00:07:15.090> about<00:07:15.300> it<00:07:17.539> alright<00:07:18.539> I

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:18.810 
or they were thinking about it alright I

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:24.080 
or they were thinking about it alright I
