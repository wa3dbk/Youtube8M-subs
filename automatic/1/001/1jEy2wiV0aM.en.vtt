00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.060 
this additional radiation put out there
in<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.420> ocean<00:01:03.830> has<00:01:04.830> seen<00:01:06.229> seal<00:01:07.229> populations

so<00:01:13.619> it's<00:01:14.490> widespread<00:01:14.939> they've<00:01:15.900> even<00:01:16.110> gone<00:01:16.409> to

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
so it's widespread they've even gone to

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.859 
so it's widespread they've even gone to
certain<00:01:17.220> levels<00:01:17.580> here<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.659> try<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.930> engineer
