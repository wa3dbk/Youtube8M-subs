00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.500
 I Reggae Rastafary Zigans on a frilans 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:12.000
 This song is dedicated to Jah who is present in all of us! Thanks! 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.000
 I Jah, I smoked! 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 I Jah, I drank! 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.600
 Yo Jah, I ate a gay, 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.000
 full of whipped cream! 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.000
 Yo, Jah, I was a freak, 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.000
 and walked with a bag! 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.000
 Without alms I bought a jeep, 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 I got it for the cudgel! 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.000
 I Jah, I was happy, 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.000
 when the girlfriend gave me money. 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.000
 Now that Jah does not give, 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.000
 I had to become the baker! 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.500
 I Jah, I smoked! 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 I Jah, I drank! 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.000
 Yo Jah, REGGAE, Reggae Reguei, 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.000
 a homeless whose name was Tim! 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 I Jah do not eat fish, Jah just like tuna, 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 Refuge mixed with nestum! Jah I fucked (bis) ... 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.200
 In fasting. 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.500
 I wore underwear and did not wash because it is common! 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.800
 I Jah drank wine from my Jahrrican! 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 Jah cooked bread with chorizo, rice and beans! 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.200
 Jah I had a dog that emotion, what joy! 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.000
 without Maria it was me who licked me! 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.800
 Brothers 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 whoever made this song was Jahrdineiro! 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.700
 and Jahrdineiro we are noizes ... 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.000
 The trees are noizes .. 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.000
 bla bla bla wiskas sachets 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.700
 ... L ‡ L ‡ L ‡ sparrows to the nest ... ... 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.600
 And the Jahrdineiro ... 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 Jah ate pipis, Jah ate salsisha, 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.300
 Jah I was very happy to put my whole hand in the chip, 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.000
 Jah ate alpista and a climber, 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.800
 Jah I wore glasses without glasses because of the sight, 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.800
 Jah I got chickenpox from a dog! 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.000
 Jah I had gonorrhea because I washed myself with a mop! 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.300
 Jah I had lice, Jah had tapeworm, Jah had tick, tummy ache, 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.700
 Jah I got 50 annoying with a friend! 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.700
 Jah drank beer, Jah drank champagne! 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.800
 Jah I stuck a cherry in the eye of a stranger! 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.700
 And in a herd I have slept night and day, 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 to eat my aunt's mule! 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.000
 I've been to Church, I've been to Miss! 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.700
 Jah I had a priest eat my tongue, 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.000
 Because the Chorizo ​​I offered him he did not want, 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.000
 He said it was crap! 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.700
 Never ends this song, 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.300
 the trumpet that played after the chorus, 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.800
 Jah passed and ended up with a lot of magic, 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.500
 This song is a joy! 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.600
 I Jah, I smoked! 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.700
 I Jah, I drank! 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.000
 Yo Jah ate a gay, 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.000
 full of whipped cream! Yo JAAAHhhh!
