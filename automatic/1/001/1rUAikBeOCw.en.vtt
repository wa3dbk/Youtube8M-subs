 us when we are bored 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.170
 we started doing anything either 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.390
 look at a fixed point in the ceiling take us 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.550
 the snot in men will begin to 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.950
 scratching the fruit bowl women do not know 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.140
 of anything or imagine things 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.360
 that will never happen but be that 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.040
 moment of action when many of 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.050
 we never occur ideas 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.370
 really cool that same has not 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.110
 to have passed a boy from england 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.820
 that for three years began to be removed 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.460
 photographs of yourself with something very 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.079
 special made timelapse singing 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.079
 a well-known song the queen 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.829
 How are you 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.920
 sells a river you never know when you can 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.780
 come that spark of such an idea 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.330
 bored of taking out her four for a thousand 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.620
 101 days but the idea can be boring 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.540
 the mere fact of taking the time to 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.520
 take your picture day after day but your 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.350
 head the idea was bright and clear 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.420
 back that finally compiled in video 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.729
 it went from being a boring idea to an idea 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.380
 surprisingly great no longer does 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.270
 lack being a nuclear scientist for 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.560
 have some great even of them 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.290
 they have their best good ideas are 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.150
 bored and even you could specify 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.190
 that crazy and great idea that is 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.770
 expressing while you're bored and 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.690
 taking out a few others and also from 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.160
 bored what many of us do is lose 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.990
 the time in these social networks that 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.520
 they are made to waste time 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.380
 hours and hours and there is a very 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.810
 particular we find you are 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.940
 tips that are repeated over and over and over 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:53.460
 time it makes us enter a small 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:55.050
 transit and give some hypnotized 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.330
 life is something but you would be watching 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.670
 how are we going gif like that yes and I 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.500
 I would also do it like xe bolts like 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.070
 that and we can very much like gears 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.070
 entertained 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:18.600
 and they are just great 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:33.080
 both looking to do it I cheated you 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.069
 again and others that are simply 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.069
 hypnotics 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.940
 i 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.310

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.860
 time I leave you eternal 2015 that for sure 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.600

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.200
 doing a promotion in and there's always the 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.220
 tele but even TV gets 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.080
 bored of the only thing you can 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.030
