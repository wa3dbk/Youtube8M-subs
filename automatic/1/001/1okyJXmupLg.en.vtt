continue on and in the fact that there

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.410 
continue on and in the fact that there
are<00:02:50.800> no<00:02:50.920> guarantees<00:02:51.460> that<00:02:51.490> just<00:02:52.000> because<00:02:52.300> you

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
are no guarantees that just because you

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.300 
are no guarantees that just because you
work<00:02:52.600> hard<00:02:52.870> doesn't<00:02:53.560> mean<00:02:53.709> you're<00:02:53.950> gonna<00:02:54.040> be<00:02:54.280> a

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
work hard doesn't mean you're gonna be a

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.680 
work hard doesn't mean you're gonna be a
champion<00:02:54.610> doesn't<00:02:55.150> mean<00:02:55.240> you're<00:02:55.360> gonna<00:02:55.420> have

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
success and and I think that that's an

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.360 
success and and I think that that's an
important<00:02:58.240> lesson<00:02:58.450> in<00:02:59.440> sports<00:02:59.950> and<00:03:00.130> it's<00:03:00.280> an

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
important lesson in sports and it's an

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.430 
important lesson in sports and it's an
important<00:03:00.790> lesson<00:03:00.820> in<00:03:01.240> life<00:03:01.450> so<00:03:02.020> I<00:03:02.320> think

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440
