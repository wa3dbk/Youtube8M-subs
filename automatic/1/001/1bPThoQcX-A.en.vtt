00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
courtesy um I think I actually think

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.020 
courtesy um I think I actually think
dynamic<00:02:45.540> is<00:02:46.050> gonna<00:02:46.260> win<00:02:46.440> I<00:02:47.280> didn't<00:02:47.670> toss<00:02:47.820> has

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
dynamic is gonna win I didn't toss has

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.960 
dynamic is gonna win I didn't toss has
more<00:02:48.300> of<00:02:48.360> like<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.570> well-rounded<00:02:49.130> I'd<00:02:50.130> say<00:02:50.370> game

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
more of like a well-rounded I'd say game

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.310 
more of like a well-rounded I'd say game
and<00:02:51.240> they've<00:02:51.570> been<00:02:51.600> a<00:02:51.720> longer<00:02:51.930> team<00:02:52.170> together

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
and they've been a longer team together

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.310 
and they've been a longer team together
but<00:02:52.970> dynamic<00:02:53.970> just<00:02:54.270> got<00:02:54.390> unintended<00:02:54.900> back<00:02:55.140> and

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
but dynamic just got unintended back and

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.660 
but dynamic just got unintended back and
his<00:02:55.410> way<00:02:55.680> he's<00:02:55.800> jungles<00:02:56.100> in<00:02:56.160> a<00:02:56.190> way<00:02:56.280> that<00:02:56.430> is<00:02:56.520> so

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
his way he's jungles in a way that is so

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.190 
his way he's jungles in a way that is so
offensive<00:02:56.760> early<00:02:57.360> I<00:02:57.510> think<00:02:57.810> I<00:02:57.840> might<00:02:57.990> give<00:02:58.170> the

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
offensive early I think I might give the

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.320 
offensive early I think I might give the
curveball<00:02:58.890> that<00:02:59.040> they<00:02:59.160> need<00:02:59.370> to<00:02:59.820> actually<00:03:00.090> be

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
curveball that they need to actually be

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.830 
curveball that they need to actually be
