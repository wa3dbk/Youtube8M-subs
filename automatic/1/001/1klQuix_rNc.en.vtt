a great weekend current temperatures all
across<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.790> area<00:01:11.820> in<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.540> sixties<00:01:13.110> 68

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
across the area in the sixties 68

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.609 
across the area in the sixties 68
degrees<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.460> Indianapolis<00:01:15.210> 59<00:01:15.930> Mount<00:01:16.229> Vernon

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
degrees in Indianapolis 59 Mount Vernon

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.200 
degrees in Indianapolis 59 Mount Vernon
they're<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.830> little<00:01:17.040> bit<00:01:17.220> cooler<00:01:17.460> because<00:01:18.090> they

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
they're a little bit cooler because they

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.240 
they're a little bit cooler because they
don't<00:01:18.360> have<00:01:18.540> as<00:01:18.630> much<00:01:18.780> fog<00:01:19.080> down<00:01:19.350> there<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.799> so

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
don't have as much fog down there and so

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.310 
don't have as much fog down there and so
the<00:01:20.430> daytime<00:01:20.729> heating<00:01:21.030> from<00:01:21.240> yesterday<00:01:21.750> is

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
the daytime heating from yesterday is

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.910 
the daytime heating from yesterday is
allowing<00:01:22.909> the<00:01:23.930> temperature<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.380> drop

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
allowing the temperature to drop

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.950 
allowing the temperature to drop
dew<00:01:26.490> points<00:01:26.850> all<00:01:26.939> across<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.390> area<00:01:27.420> are<00:01:27.930> a

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
dew points all across the area are a

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.350 
dew points all across the area are a
little<00:01:28.290> high<00:01:28.619> compared<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.579> temperature

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
little high compared to the temperature

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.010 
little high compared to the temperature
right<00:01:30.630> now<00:01:30.900> however<00:01:31.680> they're<00:01:32.640> still<00:01:33.090> under<00:01:33.299> 65

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
right now however they're still under 65

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.249 
right now however they're still under 65
degrees<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.610> means<00:01:35.850> I'm<00:01:36.720> expecting

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
degrees so that means I'm expecting

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.870 
degrees so that means I'm expecting
these<00:01:37.380> temperatures<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.490> dew<00:01:38.610> point

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
these temperatures the dew point

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.310 
these temperatures the dew point
temperatures<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.479> decrease<00:01:39.900> when<00:01:40.110> it's<00:01:40.259> a

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
temperatures to decrease when it's a

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.429 
temperatures to decrease when it's a
buddy<00:01:40.560> rises<00:01:41.490> in<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.670> sky<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.659> means<00:01:42.899> we

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
buddy rises in the sky and that means we

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.280 
buddy rises in the sky and that means we
will<00:01:43.619> not<00:01:43.799> have<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.430> much<00:01:44.790> humidity<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:46.020> high

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
will not have that much humidity so high

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.260 
will not have that much humidity so high
pressure<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.979> still<00:01:47.399> in<00:01:47.460> control<00:01:47.700> sitting
