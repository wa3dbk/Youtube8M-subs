as my retail backup smoked glass
ultimate<00:01:59.100> droid<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.700> now<00:02:00.600> there's<00:02:01.409> going<00:02:01.649> to

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
ultimate droid and now there's going to

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.880 
ultimate droid and now there's going to
be<00:02:02.009> froyo<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.729> haven't<00:02:03.600> done<00:02:03.719> this<00:02:03.930> so<00:02:04.439> just

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
be froyo I haven't done this so just

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.180 
be froyo I haven't done this so just
bear<00:02:05.070> with<00:02:05.100> me<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:06.469> hopefully<00:02:07.469> should<00:02:07.799> be

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
bear with me and hopefully should be

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.860 
bear with me and hopefully should be
working

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.869 

I'm<00:02:15.260> going<00:02:15.709> to<00:02:15.920> put<00:02:16.129> this<00:02:16.159> into<00:02:16.489> different

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
I'm going to put this into different

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:19.030 
I'm going to put this into different
parts<00:02:17.090> because<00:02:17.840> as<00:02:18.230> a<00:02:18.290> right<00:02:18.739> now<00:02:18.890> it's

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
parts because as a right now it's

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.580 
parts because as a right now it's
already<00:02:19.280> nine<00:02:19.489> minutes<00:02:22.870> so<00:02:23.870> essentially<00:02:24.290> this

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
already nine minutes so essentially this

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.949

you<00:04:46.970> do<00:04:47.090> a<00:04:47.120> wipe<00:04:47.720> cache<00:04:48.020> partition<00:04:48.250> that's<00:04:49.250> the

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
you do a wipe cache partition that's the

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.560 
you do a wipe cache partition that's the
next<00:04:49.610> one<00:04:49.820> down<00:04:51.940> I'm<00:04:52.940> just<00:04:53.030> going<00:04:53.210> to<00:04:53.270> format

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
next one down I'm just going to format

you<00:05:43.189> don't<00:05:43.339> check<00:05:43.520> any<00:05:43.729> of<00:05:43.879> that<00:05:43.969> you<00:05:44.210> just

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:44.389 
you don't check any of that you just

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:45.939 
you don't check any of that you just
leave<00:05:44.569> it<00:05:44.719> how<00:05:44.869> it<00:05:44.899> is<00:05:45.139> and<00:05:45.199> you<00:05:45.529> just<00:05:45.800> to

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:45.949 
leave it how it is and you just to

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:49.170 
leave it how it is and you just to
choose<00:05:46.249> our<00:05:46.520> you<00:05:46.909> just<00:05:47.119> do<00:05:47.210> perform<00:05:47.719> restore

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
choose our you just do perform restore

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.480 
choose our you just do perform restore
and<00:05:50.469> now<00:05:51.469> it's<00:05:51.619> going<00:05:51.710> to<00:05:51.770> restore<00:05:52.189> the<00:05:52.339> whole

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
and now it's going to restore the whole

00:05:52.490 --> 00:06:01.450 
and now it's going to restore the whole
thing<00:05:52.789> and<00:05:53.119> I<00:05:59.379> guess<00:06:00.379> I'll<00:06:00.529> cut<00:06:00.740> it<00:06:00.770> short<00:06:01.159> here

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460 
thing and I guess I'll cut it short here

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.329 
thing and I guess I'll cut it short here
and<00:06:01.669> then<00:06:02.059> return<00:06:02.389> when<00:06:02.629> it<00:06:03.009> goes<00:06:04.009> back

00:06:04.329 --> 00:06:04.339 
and then return when it goes back

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:06.579 
and then return when it goes back
because<00:06:05.119> I<00:06:05.300> have<00:06:05.479> no<00:06:05.629> idea<00:06:05.809> how<00:06:05.990> long<00:06:06.319> this<00:06:06.529> is

00:06:06.579 --> 00:06:06.589 
because I have no idea how long this is

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:09.099 
because I have no idea how long this is
going<00:06:06.800> to<00:06:06.889> take
