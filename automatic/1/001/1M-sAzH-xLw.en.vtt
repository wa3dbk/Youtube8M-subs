00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
experience that we have from every game

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.200 
experience that we have from every game
that<00:02:18.260> we<00:02:18.500> had<00:02:18.710> is<00:02:18.860> being<00:02:19.100> so<00:02:19.310> close<00:02:19.550> and<00:02:19.730> we

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
that we had is being so close and we

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.510 
that we had is being so close and we
always<00:02:20.390> stick<00:02:20.750> it<00:02:20.870> out<00:02:20.990> and<00:02:21.230> I'm<00:02:21.380> we<00:02:21.950> fight<00:02:22.220> and

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.670 
always stick it out and I'm we fight and
then<00:02:22.850> we<00:02:23.060> got<00:02:23.209> hurt<00:02:23.390> I<00:02:23.660> mean<00:02:23.930> we<00:02:24.080> got<00:02:24.260> eleven

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
then we got hurt I mean we got eleven

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.699 
then we got hurt I mean we got eleven
three<00:02:24.890> then<00:02:25.250> three<00:02:25.280> three<00:02:26.150> three<00:02:26.260> so<00:02:27.260> I<00:02:27.560> think

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
three then three three three so I think

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.830 
three then three three three so I think
my<00:02:27.980> math<00:02:28.190> right<00:02:28.430> I<00:02:28.490> think<00:02:28.640> that's<00:02:28.790> 24<00:02:29.360> you<00:02:29.720> know

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
my math right I think that's 24 you know

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.750 
my math right I think that's 24 you know
for<00:02:30.110> us<00:02:30.230> to<00:02:30.350> get<00:02:30.470> eight<00:02:30.709> more<00:02:30.980> threes<00:02:31.310> and<00:02:31.580> then

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
for us to get eight more threes and then

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.880 
for us to get eight more threes and then
I<00:02:32.090> mean<00:02:32.510> that's<00:02:32.630> kind<00:02:32.900> of<00:02:33.080> you<00:02:33.290> know<00:02:33.410> balanced

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
I mean that's kind of you know balanced

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.590 
I mean that's kind of you know balanced
everything<00:02:34.160> out<00:02:34.520> with<00:02:34.700> us<00:02:34.820> getting<00:02:35.090> beat<00:02:35.570> on

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
everything out with us getting beat on

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.120 
everything out with us getting beat on
the<00:02:35.840> boards<00:02:36.290> and<00:02:36.410> they<00:02:36.500> shoot<00:02:36.740> more<00:02:36.980> free

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
the boards and they shoot more free

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.510 
the boards and they shoot more free
throws<00:02:37.490> and<00:02:37.910> also<00:02:38.600> they're<00:02:38.780> shooting<00:02:39.110> 49%<00:02:39.740> so

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
throws and also they're shooting 49% so

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.400 
throws and also they're shooting 49% so
we<00:02:41.000> got<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.270> do<00:02:41.360> something<00:02:41.600> we<00:02:41.900> get<00:02:42.080> back<00:02:42.260> to

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
we got to do something we get back to

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.930 
we got to do something we get back to
the<00:02:42.530> drawing<00:02:42.740> board<00:02:42.860> we<00:02:43.160> get<00:02:43.310> back<00:02:43.490> in<00:02:43.640> a<00:02:43.730> lab

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
the drawing board we get back in a lab

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.120 
the drawing board we get back in a lab
and<00:02:44.270> get<00:02:44.360> ready<00:02:44.540> for<00:02:44.630> Maine<00:02:44.990> but<00:02:45.320> I<00:02:45.590> love<00:02:46.010> this
