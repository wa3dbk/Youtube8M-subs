00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.859
 it's a beginning of the consumers already in place and chicks 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:25.460

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.100
 but it tells the passion of times that the time is good for no one to 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.530
 to face the worsening of the times 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:52.730
 Baradar 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.730
 it is not certain that if my years 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.020
 comrades 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.390
 some analysts are evoking balances this year a soldier of the great 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.700
 clearance sale 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.729
 but they do not go out a shy in certain types of behaviors 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.160
 what makes you think of 100% loaded links 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.689
 a certain typology 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:15.379
 certainly not a fire 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:16.400
 Palestinian 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.400
 I worry about people with a moment a second time some moment they 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.940
 can not find their place 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.940
 not me anyway I'm pretty instinctive early 

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:28.309
 my instinct at this time is dangerous 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:30.759
 a shame that being comfortable in an era that 

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:34.539
 they urge I start to instinctively recover I can not 

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:36.399
 express it fully 

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:37.970
 they have everything for the pockets 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.359
 the time is dangerous for me 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:44.359
 otherwise I still think to be satisfied 

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:50.729
 it's moral because from what one lives an era mans a surprise 

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:53.879
 these are only the good shots 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:57.840
 I respect and almost nothing I am super paradoxical chain in the 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.389
 paradox game in the contradiction the audois cause this blog all these 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:06.149
 things 

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:07.569
 we are overwhelmed 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.789
 and already put to his credit 

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:13.029
 and we too did all that ben ali wanted to clear the pockets and if the 

00:03:13.029 --> 00:03:16.629
 discount the time is not made for that you have to ask him questions the 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:19.439
 star hated paradox 

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:22.439
 morality tests 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:25.289
 helped by his franchises on the touch 

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:28.749
 it is especially the franchisee it is especially that which bothers me it is the 

00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:29.889
 franchisor 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:32.679
 the race 

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:34.799
 the franchise is no longer livable 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.799
 that's what's on everyone's lips 

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:43.579
 photo p and then 38 smoke throws 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:45.799
 Thursday phelps 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.799
 it's a bit of frankness it becomes almost an act of delinquency 

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:55.949
 I am to feed 

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:59.059
 the romance the speeches
