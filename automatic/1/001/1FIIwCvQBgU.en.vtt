00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
time with that so we'll move on to the

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.209 
time with that so we'll move on to the
Camrys<00:02:24.799> that's<00:02:25.069> what<00:02:25.250> we're<00:02:25.400> searching<00:02:25.790> for

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:27.219 
Camrys that's what we're searching for

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:33.220 
Camrys that's what we're searching for
and<00:02:28.219> here<00:02:28.700> we<00:02:28.879> have<00:02:29.150> a<00:02:30.010> Camry<00:02:31.010> that<00:02:32.230> suffers

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
and here we have a Camry that suffers

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.550 
and here we have a Camry that suffers
from<00:02:33.349> the<00:02:33.530> same<00:02:34.209> problem<00:02:35.209> that<00:02:35.239> the<00:02:36.140> first<00:02:36.379> one

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
from the same problem that the first one

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.619 
from the same problem that the first one
has<00:02:36.769> in<00:02:36.980> there<00:02:37.129> so<00:02:37.340> if<00:02:37.489> you<00:02:37.670> look<00:02:37.939> at<00:02:38.120> this<00:02:38.299> you

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
has in there so if you look at this you

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:41.289 
has in there so if you look at this you
see<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:39.340> license<00:02:40.340> plate<00:02:40.400> has<00:02:40.730> been<00:02:40.760> blotted

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
see the license plate has been blotted

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.099 
see the license plate has been blotted
out<00:02:41.650> same<00:02:42.650> thing<00:02:42.890> on<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:43.159> back<00:02:44.049> now<00:02:45.049> the

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:45.109 
out same thing on the back now the

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:47.860 
out same thing on the back now the
question<00:02:45.620> is<00:02:45.709> why<00:02:46.099> do<00:02:46.159> they<00:02:46.639> do<00:02:46.700> this

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
question is why do they do this

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.750 
question is why do they do this
the<00:02:50.079> brokers<00:02:51.079> or<00:02:51.439> more<00:02:51.950> commonly<00:02:52.370> kerb

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
the brokers or more commonly kerb

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.270 
the brokers or more commonly kerb
stoners<00:02:53.180> are<00:02:53.359> doing<00:02:53.810> this<00:02:53.989> because<00:02:54.220> this<00:02:55.220> is

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
stoners are doing this because this is

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.140 
stoners are doing this because this is
hiding<00:02:55.939> the<00:02:56.629> license<00:02:57.409> plate<00:02:57.709> number<00:02:57.980> which<00:02:58.730> is

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
hiding the license plate number which is

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.949 
hiding the license plate number which is
trackable<00:03:00.139> with<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:00.680> DMV<00:03:00.950> and<00:03:01.760> they<00:03:02.540> do<00:03:02.599> not

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
trackable with the DMV and they do not

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.399 
trackable with the DMV and they do not
want<00:03:03.319> the<00:03:03.680> DMV<00:03:03.950> to<00:03:04.189> be<00:03:04.340> tracking<00:03:04.669> them<00:03:05.030> so<00:03:05.810> they

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:08.409 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:11.890 

so<00:03:09.409> you<00:03:09.439> don't<00:03:10.099> waste<00:03:10.489> time<00:03:10.700> with<00:03:11.389> ads<00:03:11.629> like

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
so you don't waste time with ads like

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.929 
so you don't waste time with ads like
this<00:03:12.139> because<00:03:12.530> brokers<00:03:13.220> and<00:03:13.430> Kurt<00:03:13.579> stoners

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:13.939 
this because brokers and Kurt stoners

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:17.050 
this because brokers and Kurt stoners
are<00:03:14.090> not<00:03:14.359> going<00:03:14.720> to<00:03:14.840> know<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:16.340> history<00:03:16.760> of<00:03:16.849> the

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
are not going to know the history of the

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.210 
are not going to know the history of the
