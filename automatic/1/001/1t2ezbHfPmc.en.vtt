00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
this is probably the best four packs of

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.070 
this is probably the best four packs of
opened<00:03:59.690> in<00:03:59.810> a<00:03:59.900> row<00:04:00.080> I<00:04:00.489> mean<00:04:01.489> normally<00:04:01.959> you<00:04:02.959> get

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
opened in a row I mean normally you get

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.789 
opened in a row I mean normally you get
 i'd<00:04:04.519> say<00:04:05.150> about<00:04:05.750> thirty<00:04:06.200> percent<00:04:06.320> of<00:04:06.709> my

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
 i'd say about thirty percent of my

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:10.539 
 i'd say about thirty percent of my
pack<00:04:07.040> openings<00:04:07.580> I<00:04:08.709> bump<00:04:09.709> that<00:04:09.920> up<00:04:09.950> to<00:04:10.100> forty

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
pack openings I bump that up to forty

forty<00:04:10.910> percent<00:04:11.239> successful<00:04:13.180> these<00:04:14.180> four

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
forty percent successful these four

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.979 
forty percent successful these four
hundred<00:04:15.260> percent<00:04:15.620> successful<00:04:16.510> or<00:04:17.510> I<00:04:17.570> think

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
hundred percent successful or I think

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.569
