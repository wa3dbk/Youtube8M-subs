00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
functions of the remote as you see you

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.540 
functions of the remote as you see you
have<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:44.219> play<00:00:44.789> button<00:00:45.180> stop<00:00:46.020> button<00:00:46.550> the

have the play button stop button the

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.729 
have the play button stop button the
favorite<00:00:48.090> auxilary<00:00:48.960> button<00:00:49.350> which<00:00:49.469> I'll<00:00:49.590> talk

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
favorite auxilary button which I'll talk

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.889 
favorite auxilary button which I'll talk
about<00:00:49.800> in<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.129> second<00:00:50.579> channel<00:00:51.360> button<00:00:51.629> up<00:00:51.750> and

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
about in a second channel button up and

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.420 
about in a second channel button up and
down<00:00:52.050> which<00:00:52.289> allows<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.800> scroll<00:00:53.039> through

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
down which allows you to scroll through

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.160 
down which allows you to scroll through
the<00:00:54.059> different<00:00:54.180> calls<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.750> are<00:00:54.840> on<00:00:54.930> there

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
the different calls that are on there

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.170 
the different calls that are on there
the<00:00:55.559> volume<00:00:55.860> button<00:00:56.160> which<00:00:56.280> obviously<00:00:56.699> allows

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
the volume button which obviously allows

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.819 
the volume button which obviously allows
you<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.480> change<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.780> volume<00:00:57.930> on<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.289> call<00:00:58.530> and

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
you to change the volume on the call and

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.950 
you to change the volume on the call and
then<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.670> back<00:00:59.820> like<00:01:00.059> button<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:00.660> if<00:01:00.750> you're

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
then the back like button so if you're

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.119 
then the back like button so if you're
hunting<00:01:01.079> in<00:01:01.320> low-light<00:01:01.680> err<00:01:01.710> at<00:01:01.980> night<00:01:02.899> okay

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
hunting in low-light err at night okay

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.630 
hunting in low-light err at night okay
so<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.700> basics<00:01:06.240> on<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.830> call<00:01:08.100> on<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.460> call

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
so the basics on this call on the call

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.750 
so the basics on this call on the call
itself<00:01:09.060> on<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.049> back<00:01:10.229> we<00:01:10.799> have<00:01:11.010> external

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
itself on the back we have external

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.929 
itself on the back we have external
speaker<00:01:12.299> if<00:01:12.960> for<00:01:13.590> some<00:01:13.619> reason<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.310> desire<00:01:14.790> to

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
speaker if for some reason you desire to

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.969

and then you have the SD card slot which

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.389 
and then you have the SD card slot which
is<00:01:48.299> what<00:01:48.450> we're<00:01:48.600> going<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.750> talk<00:01:48.930> about
