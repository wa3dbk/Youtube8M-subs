world<00:01:06.150> made<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.570> like<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.900> blow<00:01:07.110> or<00:01:07.290> something

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
world made it like to blow or something

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.160 
world made it like to blow or something
like<00:01:07.740> low<00:01:08.430> though<00:01:08.670> actual<00:01:09.180> minecraft<00:01:09.930> world

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
like low though actual minecraft world

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.380 
like low though actual minecraft world
that's<00:01:10.979> not<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.159> case<00:01:11.250> it's<00:01:11.670> actually<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:12.119> I

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
that's not the case it's actually it I

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.780 
that's not the case it's actually it I
think<00:01:12.750> it's<00:01:12.840> what<00:01:13.020> does<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.200> say<00:01:13.670> why<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:15.180> 70

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
think it's what does it say why is 70

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.840 
think it's what does it say why is 70
yeah<00:01:17.790> it's<00:01:17.939> 65<00:01:18.570> so<00:01:19.049> it's<00:01:19.830> not<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.189> case<00:01:20.549> we're

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
yeah it's 65 so it's not the case we're

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.999 
yeah it's 65 so it's not the case we're
not<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:21.240> don't<00:01:21.930> know<00:01:21.990> just<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.409> server<00:01:22.680> will

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009
