00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.450
 steel 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:19.560
 stylez reliable and beautiful stainless 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.489
 steel has been used for many years in 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.230
 we make excellent watches 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:28.650
 creating apple watch we use alloy 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:33.300
 stainless steel and very durable and 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:40.070
 resilient corrosion then the perry series 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:42.690
 heats and treatments makes it even harder 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.190
 while the metal is in the molten 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.129
 seeing his condition carefully 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.170
 controlled that allows you to get rid 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.350
 from impurities and provide the necessary 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.350
 hardness 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:05.950
 then follow the cold stamping tab 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:10.619
 metal becomes 80 percent harder 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.619
 and resistant to cracks and scratches 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.750
 then the workpiece is processed at 12 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.060
 positional foot from his milling machine 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.479
 which guarantees flawless exterior 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.479
 view 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:34.260
 and polished to a mirror finish for 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.210
 getting the color black space to steel 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.910
 Apply a layer of diamond like 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.070
 carbon coating which adds 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.170
 durability and gives brilliant external 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:48.960
 kind of no less attention we pay 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:52.790
 straps each block bracelet consists 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.790
 more than 140 parts 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.020
 milanese mesh bracelet produced 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.180
 from steel links 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:03.680
 woven into a thin network resembling 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.680
 cloth there butt feel 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.720
 beats you are stainless steel we gave 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.280
 traditional material 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.280
 new expressiveness
