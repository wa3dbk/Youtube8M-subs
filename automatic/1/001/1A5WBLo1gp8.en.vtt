riding<00:00:56.510> in<00:00:56.629> the<00:00:56.719> fall<00:00:56.959> and<00:00:57.109> winter<00:00:57.350> when<00:00:57.679> you

00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:57.799 
riding in the fall and winter when you

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:00.399 
riding in the fall and winter when you
need<00:00:57.949> backlight<00:00:58.429> and<00:00:58.729> it<00:00:59.329> also<00:00:59.510> has<00:00:59.839> an<00:01:00.019> ETA

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:00.409 
need backlight and it also has an ETA

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:02.680 
need backlight and it also has an ETA
feature<00:01:00.799> so<00:01:01.190> you<00:01:01.249> can<00:01:01.459> program<00:01:01.760> in<00:01:02.149> your

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
feature so you can program in your

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.229 
feature so you can program in your
typical<00:01:02.959> commute<00:01:03.559> distance<00:01:04.010> from<00:01:04.309> home<00:01:05.030> to

typical commute distance from home to

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.330 
typical commute distance from home to
the<00:01:05.330> office<00:01:05.449> and<00:01:05.990> it'll<00:01:06.740> do<00:01:07.040> a<00:01:07.070> calculation

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
the office and it'll do a calculation

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.810 
the office and it'll do a calculation
based<00:01:08.060> on<00:01:08.240> your<00:01:08.420> current<00:01:09.200> speed<00:01:09.560> and<00:01:10.010> distance

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
based on your current speed and distance

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.120 
based on your current speed and distance
covered<00:01:11.060> and<00:01:11.420> give<00:01:11.900> you<00:01:11.990> an<00:01:12.110> ETA<00:01:12.440> time<00:01:12.740> so

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
covered and give you an ETA time so

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.290 
covered and give you an ETA time so
it'll<00:01:13.460> tell<00:01:13.640> you<00:01:13.760> if<00:01:13.850> you<00:01:13.940> need<00:01:13.970> to<00:01:14.150> ride

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
it'll tell you if you need to ride

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.840 
it'll tell you if you need to ride
faster<00:01:14.720> to<00:01:14.870> get<00:01:14.990> to<00:01:15.080> the<00:01:15.170> office<00:01:15.500> on<00:01:15.650> time<00:01:15.860> and

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
faster to get to the office on time and

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.460 
faster to get to the office on time and
then<00:01:17.300> another<00:01:17.420> computer<00:01:18.110> that<00:01:18.230> we<00:01:18.320> have

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
motorists so we're really excited about

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.020 
motorists so we're really excited about
this<00:02:20.159> light<00:02:20.459> and<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:22.019> reflex<00:02:22.920> Auto<00:02:23.189> will<00:02:23.700> also

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
this light and the reflex Auto will also

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.339 
this light and the reflex Auto will also
have<00:02:24.299> a<00:02:25.340> motion<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:26.579> a<00:02:26.909> light<00:02:27.150> sensor<00:02:27.840> so<00:02:28.139> that

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
have a motion and a light sensor so that

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.080 
have a motion and a light sensor so that
it<00:02:28.499> will<00:02:28.709> sense<00:02:29.069> when<00:02:29.280> it's<00:02:29.430> dark<00:02:29.609> out<00:02:29.849> and

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
it will sense when it's dark out and

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.910 
it will sense when it's dark out and
when<00:02:30.629> the<00:02:30.780> bike<00:02:30.959> is<00:02:30.989> in<00:02:31.139> motion<00:02:31.439> and<00:02:31.769> it'll

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
when the bike is in motion and it'll

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.470 
when the bike is in motion and it'll
automatically<00:02:32.459> turn<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.849> light<00:02:33.000> on<00:02:33.150> for<00:02:33.180> you

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
automatically turn the light on for you

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.740 
automatically turn the light on for you
