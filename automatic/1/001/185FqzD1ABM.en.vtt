00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:09.039 

spit<00:00:06.649> 99s<00:00:07.129> is<00:00:07.339> the<00:00:07.549> Wilson<00:00:08.389> steam<00:00:08.629> with<00:00:08.840> spin

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:09.049 
spit 99s is the Wilson steam with spin

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:11.350 
spit 99s is the Wilson steam with spin
effect<00:00:09.349> technology<00:00:09.590> so<00:00:10.549> the<00:00:10.639> whole<00:00:10.820> idea<00:00:11.150> here

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:11.360 
effect technology so the whole idea here

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.730 
effect technology so the whole idea here
it's<00:00:11.510> the<00:00:11.629> first<00:00:11.660> racket<00:00:12.260> produced<00:00:12.530> with

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740 
it's the first racket produced with

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.560 
it's the first racket produced with
fewer<00:00:12.980> cross<00:00:13.340> strings<00:00:13.700> than<00:00:14.030> main<00:00:14.210> strings

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
fewer cross strings than main strings

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.480 
fewer cross strings than main strings
and<00:00:15.200> what<00:00:15.320> that's<00:00:15.469> allowing<00:00:15.919> the<00:00:16.040> racket<00:00:16.400> to

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.490 
and what that's allowing the racket to

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.700 
and what that's allowing the racket to
do<00:00:16.640> is<00:00:16.820> the<00:00:17.090> main<00:00:17.270> strings<00:00:17.540> can<00:00:17.750> move<00:00:17.930> more<00:00:18.230> you

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
do is the main strings can move more you

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.529 
do is the main strings can move more you
get<00:00:18.830> more<00:00:19.040> snap<00:00:19.340> back<00:00:19.580> and<00:00:19.820> as<00:00:19.880> a<00:00:19.939> result<00:00:20.330> to<00:00:20.509> be

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:20.539 
get more snap back and as a result to be

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:22.210 
get more snap back and as a result to be
able<00:00:20.689> to<00:00:20.840> put<00:00:20.990> some<00:00:21.200> more<00:00:21.320> spin<00:00:21.649> and<00:00:21.829> power<00:00:21.950> on

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
able to put some more spin and power on

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.460 
able to put some more spin and power on
the<00:00:22.309> ball<00:00:22.489> so<00:00:25.869> what<00:00:26.869> we<00:00:26.960> can<00:00:27.079> do<00:00:27.169> is<00:00:27.290> have<00:00:27.439> all

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
the ball so what we can do is have all

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.049 
the ball so what we can do is have all
these<00:00:27.680> kids<00:00:27.950> playing<00:00:28.520> and<00:00:28.730> hanging<00:00:28.910> some

00:00:29.049 --> 00:00:29.059 
these kids playing and hanging some

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:30.880 
these kids playing and hanging some
tennis<00:00:29.300> balls<00:00:29.540> with<00:00:29.899> the<00:00:30.110> with<00:00:30.410> the<00:00:30.529> Wilson

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
tennis balls with the with the Wilson

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.530 
tennis balls with the with the Wilson
steam<00:00:31.399> 99s<00:00:31.969> versus<00:00:32.899> Babolat<00:00:33.710> AeroPro<00:00:33.920> and<00:00:34.730> the

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
steam 99s versus Babolat AeroPro and the

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.450 
steam 99s versus Babolat AeroPro and the
head<00:00:35.690> speed<00:00:36.020> and<00:00:36.260> the<00:00:36.320> idea<00:00:36.649> is<00:00:36.860> to<00:00:37.280> measure

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
head speed and the idea is to measure

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.250 
head speed and the idea is to measure
how<00:00:37.730> the<00:00:37.760> kids<00:00:38.090> are<00:00:38.180> hitting<00:00:38.360> to<00:00:39.020> see<00:00:39.170> if

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
how the kids are hitting to see if

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.230 
how the kids are hitting to see if
they're<00:00:39.380> hitting<00:00:39.590> you<00:00:39.770> know<00:00:39.890> more<00:00:40.670> rpms<00:00:41.090> with

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:41.240 
they're hitting you know more rpms with

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.300 
they're hitting you know more rpms with
one<00:00:41.390> racket<00:00:41.750> force<00:00:41.930> another<00:00:42.140> speed<00:00:42.650> height

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:43.310 
one racket force another speed height

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.819 
one racket force another speed height
and<00:00:43.550> where<00:00:43.820> the<00:00:43.910> balls<00:00:44.090> landing<00:00:44.420> on<00:00:44.480> the<00:00:44.570> court

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.880 

so<00:00:48.829> Trackman<00:00:49.370> is<00:00:49.670> it's<00:00:50.450> it's<00:00:50.810> a<00:00:50.989> doppler<00:00:51.860> radar

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
so Trackman is it's it's a doppler radar

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.280 
so Trackman is it's it's a doppler radar
device<00:00:52.489> that<00:00:52.790> can<00:00:52.970> measure<00:00:53.180> all<00:00:53.840> sorts<00:00:54.230> of

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
device that can measure all sorts of

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.270 
device that can measure all sorts of
different<00:00:54.560> things<00:00:54.739> it<00:00:54.860> can<00:00:54.950> measure<00:00:55.070> the

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
different things it can measure the

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.440 
different things it can measure the
weather<00:00:55.400> if<00:00:55.640> we<00:00:55.760> wanted<00:00:56.000> to<00:00:56.090> know<00:00:56.239> what<00:00:56.360> the

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
weather if we wanted to know what the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.060 
weather if we wanted to know what the
temperature<00:00:56.600> was<00:00:56.870> up<00:00:57.170> but<00:00:57.350> specifically<00:00:57.860> to

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
temperature was up but specifically to

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.700 
temperature was up but specifically to

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:11.520 

and<00:01:10.000> what<00:01:10.270> I<00:01:10.299> found<00:01:10.600> exciting<00:01:10.960> was<00:01:11.259> all<00:01:11.409> the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
and what I found exciting was all the

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.459 
and what I found exciting was all the
kids<00:01:11.740> were<00:01:11.860> really<00:01:12.039> interested<00:01:12.789> in<00:01:13.380> some<00:01:14.380> of

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:14.469 
kids were really interested in some of

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:16.859 
kids were really interested in some of
the<00:01:14.560> results<00:01:15.130> of<00:01:15.250> you<00:01:16.090> know<00:01:16.180> where<00:01:16.450> balls<00:01:16.659> were

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
the results of you know where balls were

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:18.060 
the results of you know where balls were
landing<00:01:17.170> on<00:01:17.229> the<00:01:17.320> court<00:01:17.530> they<00:01:17.619> all<00:01:17.740> wanted<00:01:17.950> to

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
landing on the court they all wanted to

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.800 
landing on the court they all wanted to
know<00:01:18.159> how<00:01:18.310> hard<00:01:18.549> they<00:01:18.729> hit<00:01:18.759> what<00:01:19.240> their<00:01:19.390> rpms

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
know how hard they hit what their rpms

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.510 
know how hard they hit what their rpms
were<00:01:20.079> and<00:01:20.409> where<00:01:20.979> they<00:01:21.100> were<00:01:21.130> hitting<00:01:21.429> the

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
were and where they were hitting the

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.669 
were and where they were hitting the
ball<00:01:21.670> on<00:01:21.789> the<00:01:21.880> court<00:01:22.149> I<00:01:22.479> think<00:01:23.170> what<00:01:23.289> I'd<00:01:23.439> take

00:01:23.669 --> 00:01:23.679 
ball on the court I think what I'd take

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:26.460 
ball on the court I think what I'd take
away<00:01:23.979> from<00:01:24.610> today<00:01:24.909> is<00:01:24.939> that<00:01:25.630> as<00:01:25.869> you<00:01:26.079> went<00:01:26.289> up

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
away from today is that as you went up

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.309 
away from today is that as you went up
in<00:01:26.649> level<00:01:26.979> of<00:01:27.100> player<00:01:27.369> you<00:01:28.030> saw<00:01:28.329> some<00:01:28.659> really

00:01:29.309 --> 00:01:29.319 
in level of player you saw some really

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:31.230 
in level of player you saw some really
kind<00:01:29.770> of<00:01:29.829> exciting<00:01:30.310> numbers<00:01:30.610> one<00:01:30.759> kid<00:01:30.970> hit<00:01:31.119> up

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
kind of exciting numbers one kid hit up

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.359 
kind of exciting numbers one kid hit up
two<00:01:31.689> balls<00:01:31.899> in<00:01:32.079> a<00:01:32.140> row<00:01:32.170> 102<00:01:32.829> miles<00:01:33.039> an<00:01:33.250> hour

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
two balls in a row 102 miles an hour

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.370 
two balls in a row 102 miles an hour
that's<00:01:33.610> pretty<00:01:33.939> pretty<00:01:34.329> fun<00:01:34.539> that's<00:01:34.750> that's

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
that's pretty pretty fun that's that's

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.080 
that's pretty pretty fun that's that's
pretty<00:01:35.679> wicked<00:01:35.799> number<00:01:38.159> when<00:01:39.159> I<00:01:39.189> switched<00:01:39.579> to

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
pretty wicked number when I switched to

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.830 
pretty wicked number when I switched to
the<00:01:40.450> steam<00:01:40.689> racket<00:01:41.140> I<00:01:41.590> could<00:01:41.950> definitely<00:01:42.099> tell

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
the steam racket I could definitely tell

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.510 
the steam racket I could definitely tell
the<00:01:43.840> ball<00:01:44.020> coming<00:01:44.259> off<00:01:44.409> the<00:01:44.470> racket<00:01:44.950> was<00:01:45.220> a<00:01:45.280> lot

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
the ball coming off the racket was a lot

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.130 
the ball coming off the racket was a lot
higher<00:01:45.759> the<00:01:46.060> trajectory<00:01:46.539> much<00:01:46.689> easier<00:01:46.990> to<00:01:47.080> hit

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
higher the trajectory much easier to hit

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.800 
higher the trajectory much easier to hit
higher<00:01:47.380> than<00:01:47.709> it<00:01:48.179> but<00:01:49.179> the<00:01:49.299> biggest<00:01:49.479> thing<00:01:49.720> I

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
higher than it but the biggest thing I

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.050 
higher than it but the biggest thing I
saw<00:01:49.990> was<00:01:50.200> the<00:01:50.619> ball<00:01:50.799> stays<00:01:51.069> on<00:01:51.369> the<00:01:51.520> string<00:01:51.909> bed

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
saw was the ball stays on the string bed

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.419 
saw was the ball stays on the string bed
longer<00:01:52.299> and<00:01:52.599> you<00:01:52.750> can<00:01:52.929> generate<00:01:53.289> a<00:01:53.530> lot<00:01:54.099> at

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
longer and you can generate a lot at

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:55.499 
longer and you can generate a lot at
least<00:01:54.670> I<00:01:54.789> couldn't<00:01:55.060> generate<00:01:55.329> a<00:01:55.360> lot<00:01:55.479> more

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
least I couldn't generate a lot more

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.919 
least I couldn't generate a lot more
spin<00:01:55.989> I<00:01:56.939> noticed<00:01:57.939> right<00:01:58.000> away<00:01:58.119> the<00:01:58.479> amount<00:01:58.750> I

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
spin I noticed right away the amount I

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:01.020 
spin I noticed right away the amount I
had<00:01:59.140> so<00:01:59.319> much<00:01:59.439> more<00:01:59.649> spin<00:01:59.890> on<00:02:00.009> the<00:02:00.099> ball<00:02:00.220> and<00:02:00.520> it

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
had so much more spin on the ball and it

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.969 
had so much more spin on the ball and it
was<00:02:01.149> just<00:02:01.329> effortless<00:02:01.750> I<00:02:02.020> also<00:02:02.560> was<00:02:02.770> about

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
was just effortless I also was about

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.130 
was just effortless I also was about
four<00:02:03.280> miles<00:02:03.459> an<00:02:03.610> hour<00:02:03.729> faster<00:02:04.239> and<00:02:04.479> it<00:02:04.989> just

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
four miles an hour faster and it just

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.979 
four miles an hour faster and it just
really<00:02:05.319> made<00:02:05.530> a<00:02:05.560> difference<00:02:05.649> right<00:02:06.039> away<00:02:06.989> I've

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:07.989 
really made a difference right away I've

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:09.960 
really made a difference right away I've
been<00:02:08.140> doing<00:02:08.289> this<00:02:08.349> for<00:02:08.530> 17<00:02:08.829> years<00:02:09.190> and<00:02:09.549> any

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
been doing this for 17 years and any

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.640 
been doing this for 17 years and any
demo<00:02:10.329> event<00:02:10.630> that<00:02:10.899> we've<00:02:11.019> done<00:02:11.140> I<00:02:11.200> mean<00:02:11.470> over

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
demo event that we've done I mean over

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.380 
demo event that we've done I mean over
the<00:02:11.739> years<00:02:12.040> you<00:02:12.760> know<00:02:12.819> it's<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.030> same<00:02:13.209> old

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
the years you know it's the same old

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.150 
the years you know it's the same old
thing<00:02:13.599> here's<00:02:13.930> a<00:02:13.989> racket<00:02:14.500> let's<00:02:14.859> hit<00:02:15.010> some

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
thing here's a racket let's hit some

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.740 
thing here's a racket let's hit some
balls<00:02:15.340> tell<00:02:15.760> me<00:02:15.850> what<00:02:16.000> you<00:02:16.090> think<00:02:16.269> of<00:02:16.389> it<00:02:16.540> maybe

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
balls tell me what you think of it maybe

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:17.940 
balls tell me what you think of it maybe
you<00:02:16.840> have<00:02:16.959> a<00:02:17.019> speed<00:02:17.319> gun<00:02:17.560> out<00:02:17.680> there<00:02:17.829> to

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
you have a speed gun out there to

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.770 
you have a speed gun out there to
measure<00:02:18.130> this<00:02:18.790> is<00:02:18.970> really<00:02:19.299> neat<00:02:19.450> it's<00:02:19.569> so

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
measure this is really neat it's so

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.020 
measure this is really neat it's so
unique<00:02:20.079> and<00:02:20.410> to<00:02:20.829> see<00:02:21.010> them<00:02:21.220> they<00:02:21.489> all<00:02:21.639> very

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030
