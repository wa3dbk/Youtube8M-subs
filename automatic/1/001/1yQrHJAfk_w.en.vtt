00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:07.170
 hello everyone today I bring you a new 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.340
 gameplay of we can edition of x and this 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:14.280
 it's going to be like a tutorial for 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:16.529
 teach the new method of jane and hunter 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.720
 how would you say not the chinese box 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.060
 new that has been discovered in this 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.800
 sixth generation consisting of the 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.120
 chain of crystals because some 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.870
 examples 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:33.150
 this is simply fishing to fish 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:33.510
 It does not matter if it comes out what 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.510
 out 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.900
 no matter if you get different is 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.720
 pretty easy 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:45.860
 so let's be able to record voucher 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:48.710
 the only thing that needs to be done is 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.360
 move from the site as you fish in 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.280
 the site I do not have is going to go because there is 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.120
 when the chain breaks or neither 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.710
 throw before or after knowing how to collect 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.130
 the entrance later but pick it up in the 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.790
 moment 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:06.980
 in theory every time the chain goes 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:09.230
 making longer ever 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.220
 Well the probability of Chinese goes 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:14.150
 increasing 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.150
 following 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.100
 supposedly 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:24.159
 there is more probability between the race of 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.619
 20 between 20 and 40 per there are out there 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.259
 although good I can also ignore 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.630
 that he arrives earlier like for example 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:34.390
 I'm going to show it to me I got a 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:39.689
 cork an hour ago they would not be 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.689
 frozen and worth fourteen or fifteen 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.370
 and well this is a matter of luck 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:54.290
 because for example this morning 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:59.080
 I started with the jaén box and made a 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:03.070
 202 chain and did not leave me like that 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:05.960
 normal console rositas 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:11.690
 and nothing 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:14.650
 I already say this , you can leave a 14 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:19.959
 like you go out at 80 to 120 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.959
 but normal is from 20 to 40 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:29.260
 the thing is not to move from the site and about 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:33.879
 all patience although good to me when 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:37.579
 I was around 150 I do not think it comes out 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:41.180
 because I went to what the fishermen me 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:44.370
 it left awesome you have not made a 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.540
 202 cache or something like that 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.510
 and from there I went to the blue fence 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:54.120
 I wanted to find a the one for me 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:57.170
 tree to xining at 24 and then I 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:00.650
 greetings by yourself at 14 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:03.380
 I recommend bringing in the team because 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:07.239
 It can be that without itching or without 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:10.430
 give you anything you're going to founder 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:12.020
 so then I recommend a pokémon with 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.900
 windy skill like it can be for 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:18.819
 example never I his evolution or a 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:21.140
 innkeeper who left the 35 in addition to that 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:25.100
 I equate it with ball as because 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:27.440
 clear now as you can see the fresh ones 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.660
 do with super rods to the duty 35 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.550
 then it can always ignore 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.550
 as it has happened to me before contest those that 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.890
 that you have difficulties to finish 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:45.800
 and that's the only thing you know now 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.750
 same about this new box of jaén or 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.390
 be this new method is also something 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:54.260
 have to roll other sides supposedly 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:04:00.740
 they can also appear in the mixed area 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:04.730
 of the aggregates here because you get a 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:08.050
 safari with us we can start what 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.570
 worth 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.870
 and sometimes it will be the case that it appears 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.870
 been 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.329
 and nothing 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.359
 for now 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:23.099
 we do not know anything said before you know 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.490
 If I know that somewhere there is more 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:31.830
 probability of others but for example 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:36.389
 the console of route 12 and the blue does 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:41.430
 nothing tried to send 20 has left and 37 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:47.960
 of chains and here is where I made 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:51.500
 202 did not leave me from Alicante 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:54.130
 and so on until I get out if I see that I get 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.930
 one or something then manages to see the Khmers 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.740
 meanwhile this is all see you 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.740
 until next time
