00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.359 
is 600 to 1 the response time is 8
milliseconds<00:01:04.199> that's<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.890> amount<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.159> time

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
milliseconds that's the amount of time

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.160 
milliseconds that's the amount of time
it<00:01:05.400> will<00:01:05.610> take<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:06.030> single<00:01:06.450> pixel<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.900> go<00:01:07.020> from

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
it will take a single pixel to go from

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.740 
it will take a single pixel to go from
gray<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.640> required<00:01:09.330> color<00:01:09.570> or
