we've<00:00:09.050> been<00:00:09.200> making<00:00:09.350> labels<00:00:09.889> to<00:00:10.040> report<00:00:10.370> a

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:10.430 
we've been making labels to report a

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.420 
we've been making labels to report a
cultural<00:00:10.880> mining<00:00:11.420> industries<00:00:12.230> for<00:00:12.440> over<00:00:13.160> 40

cultural mining industries for over 40
years<00:00:13.459> now<00:00:13.700> so<00:00:14.539> we<00:00:14.629> know<00:00:14.750> a<00:00:14.780> lot<00:00:14.959> about<00:00:14.990> labels

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:15.680 
years now so we know a lot about labels

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.310 
years now so we know a lot about labels
we<00:00:16.430> also<00:00:16.610> know<00:00:17.150> a<00:00:17.180> lot<00:00:17.390> about<00:00:17.420> digital

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
we also know a lot about digital

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.060 
we also know a lot about digital
printers<00:00:18.740> and<00:00:18.949> I<00:00:19.850> want<00:00:20.240> to<00:00:20.330> show<00:00:20.570> you<00:00:20.630> the<00:00:21.530> okie

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:28.430 
digital printer that we use for our DIY

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.420 
digital printer that we use for our DIY
print<00:00:29.330> systems<00:00:29.840> that<00:00:30.080> enable<00:00:30.740> you<00:00:31.039> to<00:00:31.070> print

your own labels tags signage and so on

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.899 
your own labels tags signage and so on
the<00:00:36.410> reason<00:00:36.680> we<00:00:36.829> went<00:00:36.980> with<00:00:37.100> an<00:00:37.280> Okie<00:00:37.550> brenda

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:37.909 
the reason we went with an Okie brenda

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:40.810 
the reason we went with an Okie brenda
is<00:00:38.269> that<00:00:38.420> we<00:00:38.570> found<00:00:38.780> the<00:00:38.960> okie<00:00:39.409> to<00:00:40.100> be<00:00:40.249> 'miami

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
is that we found the okie to be 'miami

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.040 
is that we found the okie to be 'miami
reliable<00:00:41.690> robust<00:00:42.999> cost-effective<00:00:44.050> not

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
reliable robust cost-effective not

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.709 
reliable robust cost-effective not
extremely<00:00:45.710> expensive<00:00:46.269> it's<00:00:47.269> not<00:00:47.449> a<00:00:47.480> cheap

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
extremely expensive it's not a cheap

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:50.020 
extremely expensive it's not a cheap
bremen<00:00:48.140> but<00:00:48.379> it's<00:00:48.530> a<00:00:48.739> very<00:00:49.069> very<00:00:49.399> good<00:00:49.640> printer

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
bremen but it's a very very good printer

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.029 
bremen but it's a very very good printer
the<00:00:50.420> reason<00:00:50.780> that's<00:00:50.870> a<00:00:50.989> very<00:00:51.170> good<00:00:51.289> printer<00:00:51.620> is

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
the reason that's a very good printer is

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:55.000 
the reason that's a very good printer is
that<00:00:52.339> it<00:00:52.429> will<00:00:52.550> handle<00:00:52.789> the<00:00:53.710> substrates<00:00:54.710> that

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
that it will handle the substrates that

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.700 
that it will handle the substrates that
we<00:00:55.670> use<00:00:55.969> now<00:00:56.210> our<00:00:56.449> substrates<00:00:57.019> are<00:00:57.289> very<00:00:57.530> very

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
we use now our substrates are very very

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:58.270 
we use now our substrates are very very
tough

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
tough

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.379 
tough
that's<00:00:59.229> 0.3<00:01:00.229> of<00:01:00.319> a<00:01:00.409> millimeter<00:01:00.800> that's<00:01:01.389> where

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:02.389 
that's 0.3 of a millimeter that's where

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:03.939 
that's 0.3 of a millimeter that's where
our<00:01:02.420> cocktails<00:01:03.019> we<00:01:03.199> have<00:01:03.350> a<00:01:03.379> whole<00:01:03.589> range<00:01:03.620> of

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
our cocktails we have a whole range of

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.840 
our cocktails we have a whole range of
puck<00:01:04.159> tags<00:01:04.420> hang<00:01:05.420> tags<00:01:05.860> stamp<00:01:06.860> sheets<00:01:07.220> die-cut

puck tags hang tags stamp sheets die-cut
sheets<00:01:08.150> and<00:01:08.500> some<00:01:09.500> that<00:01:09.830> the<00:01:10.700> printer<00:01:11.060> has<00:01:11.210> to

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
sheets and some that the printer has to

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.650 
sheets and some that the printer has to
be<00:01:11.540> tough<00:01:12.050> to<00:01:12.080> handle<00:01:12.560> this<00:01:12.680> again<00:01:12.980> oh<00:01:13.660> he

the color is magnificent the really good
feature<00:01:22.160> we<00:01:22.340> have<00:01:22.400> the<00:01:22.550> ID<00:01:22.850> printer<00:01:23.180> is<00:01:23.390> if

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
feature we have the ID printer is if

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.730 
feature we have the ID printer is if
it's<00:01:23.660> a<00:01:23.780> single<00:01:24.080> pass<00:01:24.410> printer<00:01:25.930> you<00:01:26.930> can<00:01:27.230> feed

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
it's a single pass printer you can feed

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.250 
it's a single pass printer you can feed
a<00:01:28.100> rigid<00:01:28.790> sheet<00:01:29.030> through<00:01:29.360> from<00:01:29.960> the<00:01:30.080> front

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260

it's<00:01:36.440> very<00:01:36.500> very<00:01:36.830> quick<00:01:37.190> and<00:01:37.600> cost-effective

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
it's very very quick and cost-effective

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.360 
it's very very quick and cost-effective
by<00:01:38.750> the<00:01:38.810> way<00:01:39.020> they<00:01:39.740> are<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:39.980> really<00:01:40.160> good

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
look that would support a rigid machine

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.720 
look that would support a rigid machine
built<00:02:16.300> for<00:02:17.170> robust<00:02:17.620> condition<00:02:18.160> so<00:02:18.340> it<00:02:18.550> does

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
built for robust condition so it does

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
our work very very well it ticks all the

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.430 
our work very very well it ticks all the
boxes<00:02:23.650> for<00:02:24.040> us<00:02:24.250> because<00:02:25.050> not<00:02:26.050> only<00:02:26.110> does<00:02:26.380> it

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
boxes for us because not only does it
