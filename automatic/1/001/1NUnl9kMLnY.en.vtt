00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
working with my makeup sponge is a lot

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.830 
working with my makeup sponge is a lot
faster<00:02:18.950> and<00:02:19.670> of<00:02:20.060> course<00:02:20.300> when<00:02:20.480> you<00:02:20.570> apply

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
faster and of course when you apply

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.390 
faster and of course when you apply
foundation<00:02:21.020> you<00:02:21.590> just<00:02:21.770> want<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:21.980> blend<00:02:22.220> it

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
foundation you just want to blend it

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.570 
foundation you just want to blend it
down<00:02:22.670> to<00:02:23.450> your<00:02:23.540> neck<00:02:26.830> then<00:02:27.830> I<00:02:27.980> can<00:02:28.160> already<00:02:28.340> see

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
down to your neck then I can already see

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.520 
down to your neck then I can already see
that<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:28.880> color<00:02:29.090> is<00:02:29.180> blending<00:02:29.840> in<00:02:29.870> quite<00:02:30.500> well

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
that the color is blending in quite well

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.080 
that the color is blending in quite well
now<00:02:30.950> earlier<00:02:31.400> I<00:02:31.490> thought<00:02:31.670> it<00:02:31.790> was<00:02:31.880> a<00:02:31.910> little

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
now earlier I thought it was a little

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.510 
now earlier I thought it was a little
bit<00:02:32.330> dark<00:02:32.600> but<00:02:32.690> it's<00:02:33.680> blending<00:02:34.130> in<00:02:34.310> together

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
bit dark but it's blending in together

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.260 
bit dark but it's blending in together
very<00:02:35.000> nicely<00:02:35.270> and<00:02:36.050> it<00:02:36.200> is<00:02:36.410> drying<00:02:36.830> up<00:02:37.010> to<00:02:37.280> a<00:02:37.310> not

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
very nicely and it is drying up to a not

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.380 
very nicely and it is drying up to a not
duty<00:02:38.780> but<00:02:38.930> more<00:02:39.140> of<00:02:39.260> a<00:02:39.380> satin<00:02:39.650> finish<00:02:40.130> so<00:02:40.580> this

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
duty but more of a satin finish so this

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.210 
duty but more of a satin finish so this
is<00:02:41.510> what<00:02:41.660> the<00:02:41.750> foundation<00:02:42.080> looks<00:02:42.500> like<00:02:42.710> on<00:02:42.920> as

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
is what the foundation looks like on as

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.610 
is what the foundation looks like on as
you<00:02:43.340> can<00:02:43.550> see<00:02:43.760> it<00:02:43.880> has<00:02:44.090> a<00:02:44.240> really<00:02:44.510> dewy<00:02:44.900> slush

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
you can see it has a really dewy slush

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.710 
you can see it has a really dewy slush
satin<00:02:46.100> finish<00:02:46.520> and<00:02:46.790> it<00:02:47.210> feels<00:02:47.420> really

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
satin finish and it feels really

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.320 
satin finish and it feels really
lightweight<00:02:48.080> and<00:02:48.740> nice<00:02:49.610> on<00:02:49.820> the<00:02:49.970> skin<00:02:50.120> it

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
lightweight and nice on the skin it

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.180 
lightweight and nice on the skin it
doesn't<00:02:50.600> feel<00:02:50.810> thick<00:02:51.170> and<00:02:51.380> cakey<00:02:51.560> at<00:02:51.830> all<00:02:51.950> and

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
doesn't feel thick and cakey at all and

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.800 
doesn't feel thick and cakey at all and
it<00:02:52.250> doesn't<00:02:52.430> look<00:02:52.730> cakey<00:02:52.940> in<00:02:53.240> real<00:02:53.390> life<00:02:53.600> it

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
it doesn't look cakey in real life it

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.720 
it doesn't look cakey in real life it
just<00:02:53.840> looks<00:02:54.230> like<00:02:54.320> skin<00:02:54.800> one<00:02:55.190> of<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.370> things<00:02:55.610> I

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
just looks like skin one of the things I

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:56.950 
just looks like skin one of the things I
read<00:02:55.880> earlier<00:02:56.000> says<00:02:56.450> that<00:02:56.570> it<00:02:56.660> offers

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
read earlier says that it offers

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.170 
read earlier says that it offers
hydration<00:02:57.590> and<00:02:57.830> I<00:02:58.070> do<00:02:58.130> agree<00:02:58.550> with<00:02:58.610> that<00:02:58.760> claim

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
hydration and I do agree with that claim

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.990 
hydration and I do agree with that claim
because<00:02:59.390> my<00:02:59.750> skin<00:03:00.020> does<00:03:00.260> feel<00:03:00.470> hydrated<00:03:00.740> and<00:03:01.250> I

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
because my skin does feel hydrated and I

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.450 
because my skin does feel hydrated and I
also<00:03:02.210> have<00:03:02.570> some<00:03:02.960> dry<00:03:03.590> patches<00:03:03.890> a<00:03:04.100> weaker<00:03:04.280> and

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460 
also have some dry patches a weaker and

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.770 
also have some dry patches a weaker and
I<00:03:04.520> notice<00:03:04.790> that<00:03:04.910> the<00:03:05.030> foundation<00:03:05.510> didn't

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
I notice that the foundation didn't

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.170 
I notice that the foundation didn't
cling<00:03:06.020> on<00:03:06.200> to<00:03:06.410> it<00:03:06.560> so<00:03:06.740> that's<00:03:06.890> a<00:03:07.100> plus<00:03:07.340> so<00:03:08.030> if

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
cling on to it so that's a plus so if

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.000 
cling on to it so that's a plus so if
you<00:03:08.300> have<00:03:08.480> dry<00:03:08.690> skin<00:03:08.720> this<00:03:09.200> is<00:03:09.350> definitely<00:03:09.860> a

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
you have dry skin this is definitely a

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.590 
you have dry skin this is definitely a
great<00:03:10.190> foundation<00:03:10.760> for<00:03:10.790> you<00:03:11.090> if<00:03:11.300> you<00:03:11.420> have

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
great foundation for you if you have

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.240 
great foundation for you if you have
oily<00:03:11.930> skin<00:03:12.230> you<00:03:12.410> might<00:03:12.560> have<00:03:12.770> to<00:03:12.890> set<00:03:13.100> this

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
oily skin you might have to set this

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.010 
oily skin you might have to set this
with<00:03:13.460> powder<00:03:13.700> after<00:03:14.060> you're<00:03:14.180> done<00:03:14.330> I<00:03:14.570> really

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
with powder after you're done I really

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.050 
with powder after you're done I really
like<00:03:15.200> it<00:03:15.380> I<00:03:15.530> think<00:03:15.560> it<00:03:15.920> left<00:03:16.130> a<00:03:16.400> really<00:03:16.670> light

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
like it I think it left a really light

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.030 
like it I think it left a really light
to<00:03:17.270> medium<00:03:17.420> coverage<00:03:17.570> just<00:03:18.230> as<00:03:18.440> advertised

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
to medium coverage just as advertised

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.460 
to medium coverage just as advertised
but<00:03:19.760> you<00:03:20.240> can<00:03:20.390> definitely<00:03:20.750> build<00:03:20.930> it<00:03:21.110> up<00:03:21.290> I

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
but you can definitely build it up I

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.740 
but you can definitely build it up I
didn't<00:03:21.920> I<00:03:22.100> used<00:03:22.340> one<00:03:22.640> layer<00:03:22.880> and<00:03:23.180> that<00:03:23.600> was

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
didn't I used one layer and that was

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.510 
didn't I used one layer and that was
enough<00:03:24.050> to<00:03:24.080> even<00:03:24.290> on<00:03:24.470> my<00:03:24.620> skin<00:03:24.920> tone<00:03:25.070> which<00:03:25.310> I'm

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
enough to even on my skin tone which I'm

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.850 
enough to even on my skin tone which I'm
quite<00:03:25.670> happy<00:03:25.940> with<00:03:26.300> now<00:03:26.960> if<00:03:27.380> you're<00:03:27.590> looking

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
quite happy with now if you're looking

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.040 
quite happy with now if you're looking
for<00:03:28.040> something<00:03:28.280> to<00:03:28.430> cover<00:03:28.700> acne<00:03:29.030> scars<00:03:29.540> or<00:03:29.930> if

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
for something to cover acne scars or if

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.020 
for something to cover acne scars or if
you<00:03:30.140> have<00:03:30.260> problematic<00:03:30.740> skin<00:03:31.070> I<00:03:31.490> probably

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
you have problematic skin I probably

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.580 
you have problematic skin I probably
wouldn't<00:03:32.360> recommend<00:03:32.420> this<00:03:32.900> foundation

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
wouldn't recommend this foundation

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.470 
wouldn't recommend this foundation
because<00:03:34.040> it<00:03:34.220> is<00:03:34.370> lightweight<00:03:34.910> you<00:03:35.360> would

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
because it is lightweight you would

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.150 
because it is lightweight you would
probably<00:03:35.840> get<00:03:35.960> better<00:03:36.170> results<00:03:36.590> with<00:03:36.740> a<00:03:36.890> full

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
probably get better results with a full

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.010 
probably get better results with a full
coverage<00:03:37.400> foundation<00:03:37.580> all<00:03:38.360> in<00:03:38.540> all<00:03:38.660> I<00:03:38.690> did

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 
coverage foundation all in all I did

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.630 
coverage foundation all in all I did
enjoy<00:03:39.290> this<00:03:39.500> foundation<00:03:40.070> and<00:03:40.220> I<00:03:40.310> think<00:03:40.520> it's

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
enjoy this foundation and I think it's

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
throughout the day another thing is that

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.920 
throughout the day another thing is that
this<00:03:55.100> thing<00:03:55.400> over<00:03:55.550> here<00:03:55.790> actually<00:03:55.970> pops<00:03:56.450> up<00:03:56.690> so

talk<00:04:01.010> about<00:04:01.040> this<00:04:01.430> product<00:04:01.730> is<00:04:01.970> the<00:04:02.120> fact<00:04:02.150> that

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
talk about this product is the fact that

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.900

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
it only comes in six shades so it's

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.610 
it only comes in six shades so it's
quite<00:04:05.240> restricted<00:04:05.930> and<00:04:06.200> if<00:04:06.350> you're<00:04:06.470> in

natural skin Peaks through a bit and at
first<00:04:16.420> I<00:04:16.690> thought<00:04:16.870> the<00:04:17.019> foundation<00:04:17.470> was<00:04:17.590> dark

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
first I thought the foundation was dark

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.979 
first I thought the foundation was dark
on<00:04:18.010> me<00:04:18.160> but<00:04:18.489> as<00:04:19.090> you<00:04:19.269> can<00:04:19.390> see<00:04:19.450> it<00:04:19.720> looks<00:04:19.900> really

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
on me but as you can see it looks really

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.449 
on me but as you can see it looks really
natural<00:04:20.350> now<00:04:20.680> so<00:04:20.950> if<00:04:21.130> you're<00:04:21.250> in<00:04:21.370> between

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
natural now so if you're in between

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.940 
natural now so if you're in between
shades<00:04:22.030> it<00:04:22.390> might<00:04:22.570> be<00:04:22.720> alright<00:04:23.110> especially<00:04:23.860> if

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
shades it might be alright especially if

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.380 
shades it might be alright especially if
you're<00:04:24.100> just<00:04:24.340> a<00:04:24.490> shade<00:04:24.760> darker<00:04:25.180> or<00:04:25.360> lighter

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
you're just a shade darker or lighter
