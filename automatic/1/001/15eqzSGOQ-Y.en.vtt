00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
is the one we did the blue modification

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.790 
is the one we did the blue modification
on<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.840> we<00:00:18.840> put<00:00:19.050> that<00:00:20.090> our<00:00:21.090> effect<00:00:21.930> 75<00:00:22.500> on<00:00:22.710> the

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
on and we put that our effect 75 on the

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.210 
on and we put that our effect 75 on the
back<00:00:22.980> of<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.250> this<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.760> first<00:00:24.300> generation

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
back of it this is a first generation

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.769 
back of it this is a first generation
rci<00:00:26.840> 2950<00:00:28.970> very<00:00:29.970> first<00:00:30.240> one<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:30.539> used<00:00:30.689> to

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
rci 2950 very first one that used to

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:31.970 
rci 2950 very first one that used to
have<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.050> battery<00:00:31.230> on<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.590> back<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.920> the

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
have the battery on the back of the

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.209 
have the battery on the back of the
daughter<00:00:32.160> board<00:00:32.399> so<00:00:33.390> we<00:00:33.660> got<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:33.899> all<00:00:33.989> set<00:00:34.170> up

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219 
daughter board so we got it all set up

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:41.780 
daughter board so we got it all set up
where<00:00:36.170> 27<00:00:37.170> 205<00:00:38.420> we've<00:00:39.420> got<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:40.460> coax<00:00:41.460> going

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
where 27 205 we've got the coax going

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.720 
where 27 205 we've got the coax going
into<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.120> bird<00:00:42.500> at<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.530> bird<00:00:43.710> coax<00:00:44.190> going<00:00:44.579> out

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
into the bird at the bird coax going out

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.279 
into the bird at the bird coax going out
to<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.390> dummy<00:00:45.660> load<00:00:45.809> or<00:00:46.469> wat<00:00:46.649> download<00:00:48.170> we<00:00:49.170> got

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
to the dummy load or wat download we got

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.220 
to the dummy load or wat download we got
the<00:00:49.440> Aster<00:00:49.890> on<00:00:49.980> at<00:00:50.160> 13.8<00:00:50.789> volts<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.360> don't<00:00:52.170> know

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
the Aster on at 13.8 volts I don't know

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.319 
the Aster on at 13.8 volts I don't know
if<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:53.430> guys<00:00:53.579> have<00:00:53.699> been<00:00:53.820> wondering<00:00:54.120> why<00:00:54.300> I

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
if you guys have been wondering why I

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.590 
if you guys have been wondering why I
always<00:00:54.570> show<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.140> but<00:00:55.579> basically<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.940> lot<00:00:57.510> of

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
always show that but basically a lot of

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.830 
always show that but basically a lot of
these<00:00:57.690> are<00:00:58.079> effects<00:00:58.469> 75<00:00:58.920> videos<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.640> whatnot

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
these are effects 75 videos and whatnot

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.750 
these are effects 75 videos and whatnot
or<00:01:00.840> even<00:01:01.079> just<00:01:01.109> whatever<00:01:01.859> simple<00:01:02.430> peak<00:01:02.609> and

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
or even just whatever simple peak and

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.520 
or even just whatever simple peak and
tunes<00:01:02.969> they<00:01:03.270> never<00:01:03.989> show<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.290> what<00:01:04.409> they're

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
tunes they never show you what they're

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.260 
tunes they never show you what they're
running<00:01:04.769> them<00:01:04.860> at<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.250> if<00:01:05.309> they<00:01:05.430> push<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.670> up<00:01:05.880> 14

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
running them at so if they push it up 14

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.310 
running them at so if they push it up 14
14<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.840> half<00:01:07.189> you<00:01:08.189> know<00:01:08.220> in<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.760> car<00:01:09.140> doing<00:01:10.140> a

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
14 and a half you know in a car doing a

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.020 
14 and a half you know in a car doing a
video<00:01:10.470> while<00:01:10.740> it's<00:01:10.799> running<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.400> mean<00:01:11.640> it'sit's

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
video while it's running I mean it'sit's

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.429 
video while it's running I mean it'sit's
kind<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.420> misleading<00:01:12.780> because<00:01:12.930> you're

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
kind of misleading because you're

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.320 
kind of misleading because you're
basically<00:01:13.799> over<00:01:14.070> bolting<00:01:14.430> everything<00:01:14.520> so

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
basically over bolting everything so

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.929 
basically over bolting everything so
you'll<00:01:15.630> get<00:01:15.780> more<00:01:15.900> power<00:01:16.110> out<00:01:16.229> of<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.880> but<00:01:17.880> I

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
you'll get more power out of it but I

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.920 
you'll get more power out of it but I
want<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.150> show<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.360> at<00:01:18.450> 13.8<00:01:19.460> because<00:01:20.810> you<00:01:21.810> know

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
want to show it at 13.8 because you know

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.899 
want to show it at 13.8 because you know
if<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.350> run<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.590> on<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.860> house<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.759> got<00:01:23.880> a

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
if you run it on the house you got a

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.570 
if you run it on the house you got a
power<00:01:24.150> supply<00:01:25.189> want<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.250> get<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.369> true

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
power supply want to get a true

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.100 
power supply want to get a true
representation<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.299> what's<00:01:27.509> really<00:01:27.630> going<00:01:27.990> on

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
representation of what's really going on

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
so alright so we've got it set to the

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.230 
so alright so we've got it set to the
lighting<00:01:31.860> sucks<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.220> here<00:01:32.250> but<00:01:32.549> it's<00:01:32.820> on<00:01:32.970> am

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
lighting sucks in here but it's on am

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.620 
lighting sucks in here but it's on am
right<00:01:33.390> now<00:01:34.220> the<00:01:35.220> peak<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.700> off<00:01:35.880> so<00:01:36.450> we're

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
right now the peak it is off so we're

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.999 
right now the peak it is off so we're
reading<00:01:36.930> RM<00:01:37.200> s<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:38.360> hundred<00:01:39.360> watt<00:01:39.540> slug<00:01:40.009> so

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
reading RM s is a hundred watt slug so

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.100 
reading RM s is a hundred watt slug so
we'll<00:01:41.250> be<00:01:41.430> reading<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.790> bottom<00:01:42.060> scale<00:01:42.360> 0<00:01:42.750> 20

all<00:02:10.320> the<00:02:10.380> way<00:02:10.470> down<00:02:15.710> barely<00:02:16.710> moves<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.040> meter

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
all the way down barely moves the meter

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.300 
all the way down barely moves the meter
so<00:02:18.390> now<00:02:18.510> I'm<00:02:18.660> going<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:18.870> switch<00:02:19.140> this<00:02:20.100> over

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
so now I'm going to switch this over

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.080 
so now I'm going to switch this over
here<00:02:20.760> i'm<00:02:21.750> just<00:02:21.900> going<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:22.140> dial<00:02:22.350> this<00:02:22.530> up

here i'm just going to dial this up

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.690 
here i'm just going to dial this up
you'll<00:02:24.090> see<00:02:24.300> when<00:02:24.510> you<00:02:24.600> do<00:02:24.750> an<00:02:24.870> install<00:02:25.230> of<00:02:25.700> one

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
gonna flip over to FM we'll see what

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:06.610

it's<00:02:55.920> doing<00:02:55.950> there<00:03:02.960> same<00:03:03.960> 12<00:03:04.230> watts<00:03:04.470> so<00:03:04.980> on<00:03:05.400> FM

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620
