system okay let's talk about the

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:32.630 
system okay let's talk about the
centrifugal<00:00:29.609> brake<00:00:29.820> first<00:00:31.399> since<00:00:32.399> there's<00:00:32.579> a

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
centrifugal brake first since there's a

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.950 
centrifugal brake first since there's a
lot<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:32.910> reels<00:00:33.090> out<00:00:33.270> there<00:00:33.510> no<00:00:33.660> matter<00:00:33.690> what

company that have this type of braking

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.670 
company that have this type of braking
system<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:36.390> looks<00:00:36.420> just<00:00:36.690> like<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:37.170> on<00:00:37.410> the

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
system it looks just like this on the

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.410 
system it looks just like this on the
inside<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.700> have<00:00:38.850> all<00:00:39.000> these<00:00:39.149> little

inside and you have all these little
brake<00:00:40.020> pads<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.590> either<00:00:40.710> pop<00:00:41.100> in<00:00:41.280> or<00:00:41.399> pop<00:00:41.579> out

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
brake pads that either pop in or pop out

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.180 
brake pads that either pop in or pop out
there's<00:00:42.390> usually<00:00:42.780> six<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.530> them<00:00:43.680> okay<00:00:44.160> I

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
there's usually six of them okay I

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.650 
there's usually six of them okay I
haven't<00:00:44.550> seen<00:00:44.820> any<00:00:44.969> with<00:00:45.149> anymore<00:00:45.510> there

maybe and one thing to remember when you

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.760 
maybe and one thing to remember when you
are<00:00:50.010> setting<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.760> brake<00:00:51.329> pads<00:00:51.600> up<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.020> always

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
are setting the brake pads up is always

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.830 
are setting the brake pads up is always
make<00:00:53.039> sure<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.520> it's<00:00:53.699> it's<00:00:54.000> even<00:00:54.570> all<00:00:54.719> the

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
make sure that it's it's even all the

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.350 
make sure that it's it's even all the
way<00:00:54.870> around<00:00:55.079> in<00:00:55.770> other<00:00:55.860> words<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:57.000> can<00:00:57.210> either

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
way around in other words you can either

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.840 
way around in other words you can either
pop<00:00:57.570> out<00:00:57.809> two<00:00:58.609> three<00:00:59.609> four<00:01:00.289> or<00:01:01.289> all<00:01:01.469> six<00:01:01.890> but<00:01:02.760> if

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
pop out two three four or all six but if

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.859 
pop out two three four or all six but if
you<00:01:02.969> pop<00:01:03.180> out<00:01:03.329> one<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:04.110> makes<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.939> spool

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
you pop out one it makes the the spool

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.380 
you pop out one it makes the the spool
uneven<00:01:07.860> when<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.130> when<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.400> breaks<00:01:08.610> if<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.150> pop

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
uneven when it when it breaks if you pop

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.560 
uneven when it when it breaks if you pop
out<00:01:10.010> five<00:01:11.010> same<00:01:11.670> thing<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.060> makes<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.330> uneven

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
out five same thing it makes it uneven

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.960 
out five same thing it makes it uneven
the<00:01:12.810> reason<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.170> say<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.439> can<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:14.490> can<00:01:14.640> pop<00:01:14.820> out

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
the reason I say you can you can pop out

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.760 
the reason I say you can you can pop out
three<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.299> because<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.869> star-shaped<00:01:16.229> and

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
three is because it is a star-shaped and

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.890 
three is because it is a star-shaped and
that's<00:01:17.549> actually<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.090> way<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.270> like<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.600> pop

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
that's actually the way I like to pop

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.840 
that's actually the way I like to pop
most<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.290> mine<00:01:19.439> out<00:01:19.470> this<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:19.950> my<00:01:20.040> frog<00:01:20.340> rod<00:01:20.610> and

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
most of mine out this is my frog rod and

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.310 
most of mine out this is my frog rod and
I<00:01:20.909> don't<00:01:20.970> have<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.570> don't<00:01:21.600> think<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.960> have<00:01:22.110> any

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
I don't have I don't think I have any

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.440 
I don't have I don't think I have any
out<00:01:23.900> but<00:01:24.900> anyway<00:01:25.020> when<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.530> do<00:01:26.030> you<00:01:27.030> pop<00:01:27.210> all

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
tighten it down okay and that's how you

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.040 
tighten it down okay and that's how you
start<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.840> out<00:01:57.960> now

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
start it out now

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.660 
start it out now
the<00:02:00.440> magnetic<00:02:00.740> braking<00:02:01.160> system<00:02:01.460> is<00:02:01.520> pretty

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
the magnetic braking system is pretty

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.560 
the magnetic braking system is pretty
easy<00:02:01.940> all<00:02:02.240> you<00:02:02.600> do<00:02:02.930> is<00:02:03.640> you<00:02:04.640> turn<00:02:04.880> your<00:02:05.390> dial

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
easy all you do is you turn your dial

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.690 
easy all you do is you turn your dial
all<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:06.110> way<00:02:06.230> off<00:02:06.380> before<00:02:07.160> you<00:02:07.280> get<00:02:07.400> started

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
all the way off before you get started

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.260 
all the way off before you get started
okay<00:02:08.330> just<00:02:09.140> like<00:02:09.320> that<00:02:09.760> let's<00:02:10.760> start<00:02:10.820> off<00:02:11.060> with

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
okay just like that let's start off with

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.230 
okay just like that let's start off with
the<00:02:11.480> centrifugal<00:02:11.870> braking<00:02:12.320> system<00:02:12.650> okay<00:02:13.490> this

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
the centrifugal braking system okay this

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.290 
the centrifugal braking system okay this
is<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.510> Revo<00:02:14.780> s<00:02:14.960> and<00:02:15.430> you<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:16.850> you<00:02:16.910> crank<00:02:17.150> this

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
is the Revo s and you and you crank this

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.330 
is the Revo s and you and you crank this
knob<00:02:17.540> till<00:02:18.170> your<00:02:18.350> lure<00:02:18.500> stops<00:02:18.830> to<00:02:19.010> fall<00:02:19.190> when

just barely starts to fall okay then you
check<00:02:39.260> it<00:02:39.440> a<00:02:40.780> little<00:02:41.780> bit<00:02:41.990> looser<00:02:43.000> and<00:02:44.000> that's

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
check it a little bit looser and that's

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.640 
check it a little bit looser and that's
it<00:02:44.390> that's<00:02:44.570> how<00:02:44.720> you<00:02:44.780> set<00:02:45.050> that<00:02:45.230> one<00:02:45.350> up<00:02:45.380> it's

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
it that's how you set that one up it's

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.890 
it that's how you set that one up it's
all<00:02:45.770> ready<00:02:46.010> to<00:02:46.130> go<00:02:46.600> okay
