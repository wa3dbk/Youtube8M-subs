guy fight for a long time and I always

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.910 
guy fight for a long time and I always
thought<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.140> was<00:01:04.229> gonna<00:01:04.320> be<00:01:04.409> knuckle<00:01:04.799> and

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
thought that it was gonna be knuckle and

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.320 
thought that it was gonna be knuckle and
shoot<00:01:05.159> who<00:01:05.309> are<00:01:05.369> gonna<00:01:05.489> be<00:01:05.640> fighting<00:01:05.850> against

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
shoot who are gonna be fighting against

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.000 
shoot who are gonna be fighting against
him<00:01:06.450> but<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.229> looks<00:01:07.409> like<00:01:07.530> it's<00:01:07.680> gonna<00:01:07.799> be

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
him but it looks like it's gonna be

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.100 
him but it looks like it's gonna be
their<00:01:08.159> master<00:01:08.460> Morel<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.240> essentially<00:01:09.990> we

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
their master Morel and essentially we

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.480 
their master Morel and essentially we
see<00:01:10.290> he<00:01:10.470> has<00:01:10.590> this<00:01:10.770> power<00:01:10.950> where<00:01:11.250> he<00:01:11.340> can

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
see he has this power where he can

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.670 
see he has this power where he can
transport<00:01:11.909> people<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.510> this<00:01:12.900> weird<00:01:13.229> pocket

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
transport people to this weird pocket

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.440 
transport people to this weird pocket
space<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.220> any<00:01:14.580> place<00:01:14.820> he<00:01:14.970> wants<00:01:15.330> and

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
space of any place he wants and

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.700 
space of any place he wants and
apparently<00:01:15.750> he<00:01:15.900> takes<00:01:16.110> them<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.530> like

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
apparently he takes them to this like

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.710 
apparently he takes them to this like
African<00:01:17.220> savannah<00:01:17.580> which<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.299> perfect

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
African savannah which is perfect

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.080 
African savannah which is perfect
because<00:01:18.900> he's<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.200> cheetah<00:01:19.500> but<00:01:20.400> still<00:01:20.729> it's

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
because he's a cheetah but still it's

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.760 
because he's a cheetah but still it's
not<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.509> biggest<00:01:21.960> space<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.380> world<00:01:22.560> it's

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
not the biggest space in the world it's

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.050 
not the biggest space in the world it's
actually<00:01:23.040> only<00:01:23.159> about<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.580> size<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:24.000> a

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
actually only about the size of a

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.550 
actually only about the size of a
baseball<00:01:24.210> field<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.840> that's<00:01:24.960> because<00:01:25.259> Morel

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
baseball field and that's because Morel

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.440 
baseball field and that's because Morel
goes<00:01:25.770> through<00:01:25.979> this<00:01:26.040> huge<00:01:26.369> explanation<00:01:27.270> of

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
goes through this huge explanation of

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.270 
goes through this huge explanation of
how<00:01:27.810> all<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.229> this<00:01:28.350> seems<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.829> work<00:01:29.009> and

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
how all of this seems to work and

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.859 
how all of this seems to work and
apparently<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.000> only<00:01:30.270> way<00:01:30.390> he's<00:01:30.570> gonna<00:01:30.659> be

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
apparently the only way he's gonna be

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.780 
apparently the only way he's gonna be
able<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.079> get<00:01:31.200> out<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.470> here<00:01:31.680> is<00:01:31.829> if<00:01:32.430> he<00:01:32.549> beats

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
able to get out of here is if he beats

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.390 
able to get out of here is if he beats
the<00:01:32.939> hell<00:01:33.119> out<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.390> Chi<00:01:33.570> -<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.020> it's<00:01:34.770> made<00:01:35.189> even

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
the hell out of Chi - and it's made even

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.800 
the hell out of Chi - and it's made even
more<00:01:35.700> apparent<00:01:35.939> by<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.240> fact<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.570> there's

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
more apparent by the fact that there's

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.960 
more apparent by the fact that there's
this<00:01:36.960> like<00:01:37.140> giant<00:01:37.590> hourglass<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.430> they<00:01:38.820> have

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
this like giant hourglass and they have

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.969 
this like giant hourglass and they have
8<00:01:39.210> hours<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.750> go<00:01:39.869> through<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:40.170> whole<00:01:40.409> process

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
8 hours to go through this whole process

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.770 
8 hours to go through this whole process
and<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.340> think<00:01:41.729> this<00:01:41.909> is<00:01:42.030> gonna<00:01:42.150> be<00:01:42.240> like<00:01:42.630> this

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
and you think this is gonna be like this

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.109 
and you think this is gonna be like this
big<00:01:43.079> action<00:01:43.560> scene<00:01:43.799> but<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.549> looks<00:01:44.700> like<00:01:44.820> Morel

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
big action scene but it looks like Morel

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.760 
big action scene but it looks like Morel
is<00:01:45.210> just<00:01:45.390> gonna<00:01:45.509> sort<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.869> kick<00:01:46.049> back<00:01:46.290> have<00:01:46.740> a

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
is just gonna sort of kick back have a

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.100 
is just gonna sort of kick back have a
smoke<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.280> his<00:01:47.369> pipe<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.850> take<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.000> big<00:01:48.329> nap<00:01:48.630> it

smoke of his pipe and take a big nap it
looks<00:01:49.259> like<00:01:49.409> this<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.649> gonna<00:01:49.770> be<00:01:49.829> more<00:01:50.130> a

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
looks like this is gonna be more a

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.760 
looks like this is gonna be more a
battle<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.000> minds<00:01:51.270> than<00:01:51.630> anything<00:01:51.930> but

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
one part of this episode that I thought

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.010 
one part of this episode that I thought
was<00:02:27.459> really<00:02:27.610> strange<00:02:28.030> and<00:02:28.180> kind<00:02:28.390> of<00:02:28.450> creepy

whatever this girl is actually playing

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.030 
whatever this girl is actually playing
this<00:02:30.790> game<00:02:31.090> she<00:02:31.390> opens<00:02:31.780> up<00:02:31.870> her<00:02:32.020> eyes<00:02:32.260> and<00:02:32.709> it's

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
this game she opens up her eyes and it's

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.560 
this game she opens up her eyes and it's
really<00:02:33.459> creepy<00:02:33.880> looking<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.330> I<00:02:34.360> don't<00:02:34.420> know

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
really creepy looking and I don't know

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.480 
really creepy looking and I don't know
what<00:02:34.660> to<00:02:34.780> make<00:02:34.810> of<00:02:34.990> it<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:35.410> you<00:02:36.100> know<00:02:36.220> I<00:02:36.250> think

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.340 
what to make of it and you know I think

knuckle<00:03:39.190> doesn't<00:03:39.519> even<00:03:39.640> look<00:03:39.880> like<00:03:40.060> he's<00:03:40.269> from

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540
