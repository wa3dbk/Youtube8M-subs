wrap it twice again and tie it tight cut
it<00:04:15.780> off<00:04:15.930> and<00:04:16.880> then<00:04:17.880> it's<00:04:18.030> all<00:04:18.180> together<00:04:18.389> then

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.039 
it off and then it's all together then
you<00:04:18.989> can<00:04:19.169> kind<00:04:19.320> of<00:04:19.470> shape<00:04:19.709> it<00:04:19.859> up<00:04:19.949> a<00:04:20.160> little<00:04:20.280> bit

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
you can kind of shape it up a little bit

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.400 
you can kind of shape it up a little bit
it's<00:04:22.049> not<00:04:22.349> going<00:04:22.590> to<00:04:22.680> come<00:04:22.830> apart<00:04:24.259> you<00:04:25.259> have<00:04:25.380> a

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
it's not going to come apart you have a

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.100 
it's not going to come apart you have a
few<00:04:25.650> feathers<00:04:25.889> floating<00:04:26.400> around<00:04:26.490> but<00:04:27.110> other

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
few feathers floating around but other

few feathers floating around but other
than<00:04:28.229> that<00:04:28.289> is<00:04:28.530> not<00:04:28.680> going<00:04:28.800> to<00:04:28.860> come<00:04:29.009> apart<00:04:29.960> so

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
than that is not going to come apart so

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.219 
than that is not going to come apart so
there<00:04:31.259> is<00:04:31.289> basically<00:04:32.009> it's<00:04:32.130> all<00:04:32.220> together<00:04:33.229> so

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
there is basically it's all together so

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:35.689 
there is basically it's all together so
now<00:04:34.380> what<00:04:34.500> you<00:04:34.620> want<00:04:34.800> to<00:04:34.860> do<00:04:35.039> is<00:04:35.340> you<00:04:35.490> want<00:04:35.550> to

around you could pull your feathers up a
little<00:05:17.120> bit<00:05:17.300> just<00:05:17.630> so<00:05:17.720> they<00:05:17.900> don't<00:05:17.930> get

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.710 
you just cut this extra off and then I
leave<00:05:33.830> a<00:05:34.010> quick<00:05:34.250> heat<00:05:34.490> seal<00:05:34.760> I<00:05:35.090> hope<00:05:35.389> you<00:05:35.540> don't

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
leave a quick heat seal I hope you don't

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.540 
leave a quick heat seal I hope you don't
catch<00:05:35.870> the<00:05:36.080> feathers<00:05:36.380> on<00:05:36.530> fire<00:05:36.770> because<00:05:37.040> they

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
catch the feathers on fire because they

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:48.100 
catch the feathers on fire because they
stink<00:05:45.910> so<00:05:46.910> then<00:05:47.060> once<00:05:47.210> you've<00:05:47.389> got<00:05:47.570> that<00:05:47.780> and

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
stink so then once you've got that and

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:55.600 
stink so then once you've got that and
you<00:05:48.200> turn<00:05:48.530> it<00:05:48.560> back<00:05:48.740> around<00:05:48.770> and<00:05:54.310> just<00:05:55.310> kind<00:05:55.550> of

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 
you turn it back around and just kind of

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:06.270 
you turn it back around and just kind of
fluff<00:05:55.880> it<00:05:56.030> all<00:05:56.150> up

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.280 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.850 

and<00:06:07.280> then<00:06:07.430> it's<00:06:07.550> pretty<00:06:07.700> much<00:06:07.790> together<00:06:08.860> now

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
and then it's pretty much together now

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.550 
and then it's pretty much together now
you<00:06:09.920> want<00:06:10.550> to<00:06:10.610> add<00:06:12.220> your<00:06:13.220> Center

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:18.860 
in the center so we're just gonna add

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:24.850 
in the center so we're just gonna add
that<00:06:19.040> right<00:06:19.310> in<00:06:19.520> the<00:06:19.610> center<00:06:20.000> and<00:06:23.740> hold<00:06:24.740> it

that right in the center and hold it
until<00:06:24.950> it<00:06:25.160> it<00:06:25.730> sets<00:06:26.060> it<00:06:26.330> doesn't<00:06:26.660> take<00:06:26.750> very

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:26.930 
until it it sets it doesn't take very

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.830 
until it it sets it doesn't take very
long<00:06:27.050> like<00:06:27.800> I<00:06:27.890> said<00:06:28.100> it's<00:06:28.250> hot<00:06:29.240> glue<00:06:29.480> this<00:06:29.660> is

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 
long like I said it's hot glue this is

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:36.070 
long like I said it's hot glue this is
now<00:06:29.960> I<00:06:30.020> use<00:06:30.380> the<00:06:30.650> high<00:06:30.950> temp<00:06:31.250> hot<00:06:31.460> glue<00:06:35.020> okay<00:06:36.020> so

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 
now I use the high temp hot glue okay so

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.840 
now I use the high temp hot glue okay so
then<00:06:36.380> now<00:06:36.560> we<00:06:36.680> have<00:06:36.890> to<00:06:37.040> do<00:06:37.130> is<00:06:37.250> add<00:06:37.490> the

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:37.850 
then now we have to do is add the

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:49.600 
then now we have to do is add the
alligator<00:06:38.600> clip<00:06:43.060> to<00:06:44.060> the<00:06:44.090> back<00:06:48.370> just<00:06:49.370> push<00:06:49.580> it

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:49.610 
alligator clip to the back just push it

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:56.250

hold<00:06:50.030> it<00:06:50.090> tight<00:06:50.300> till<00:06:50.540> it<00:06:50.660> pretty<00:06:51.350> much<00:06:51.470> sets

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:56.260 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.190 

and<00:06:57.260> then<00:06:57.410> you<00:06:57.530> could<00:06:57.680> just<00:06:57.830> fluff<00:06:58.130> your<00:06:58.280> bow
