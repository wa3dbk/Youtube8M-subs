they cannot be deleted take the clock
for<00:01:23.460> example<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:24.119> can<00:01:24.720> move<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.200> clock

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
for example I can move the clock

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.990 
for example I can move the clock
anywhere<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.689> want<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.049> move<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.400> but<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.430> cannot

anywhere I want to move it but I cannot
delete<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.689> clock<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.799> there<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.130> no<00:01:32.340> X<00:01:32.579> in

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
delete the clock and there is no X in

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.160 
delete the clock and there is no X in
the<00:01:32.850> upper<00:01:32.880> left<00:01:33.270> hand<00:01:33.329> corner<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.930> will

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
the upper left hand corner that will

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.710 
the upper left hand corner that will
allow<00:01:34.560> me<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:35.040> delete<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.460> clock<00:01:35.670> it's<00:01:36.210> one<00:01:36.630> of

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
like to move it so you not just limited

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.990 
like to move it so you not just limited
to<00:01:46.380> moving<00:01:46.829> on<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.070> same<00:01:47.280> page<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.700> can<00:01:47.820> move

to moving on the same page you can move

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.700 
to moving on the same page you can move
over<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.689> next<00:01:48.810> page<00:01:49.110> by<00:01:49.439> just<00:01:49.649> sliding

over<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.399> edge<00:01:52.040> you<00:01:53.040> can<00:01:53.189> even<00:01:53.280> create<00:01:53.729> a

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
over to the edge you can even create a

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.760 
over to the edge you can even create a
brand<00:01:54.180> new<00:01:54.299> page<00:01:54.570> by<00:01:54.840> sliding<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.380> all<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.680> way

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
brand new page by sliding it all the way

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.719 
brand new page by sliding it all the way
over<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.250> it'll<00:01:56.939> be<00:01:57.090> by<00:01:57.719> itself<00:01:58.310> on<00:01:59.310> its<00:01:59.340> own

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
over and it'll be by itself on its own

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.149 
over and it'll be by itself on its own
page<00:02:00.119> like<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.229> so<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.500> just<00:02:01.680> hit<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.950> home

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
page like that so you just hit the home

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.149 
page like that so you just hit the home
button<00:02:02.189> again<00:02:02.790> which<00:02:03.299> is<00:02:03.329> down<00:02:03.630> here<00:02:04.159> home

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
button again which is down here home

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.779 
button again which is down here home
button<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:06.000> exit<00:02:06.570> out<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.079> jiggle<00:02:07.590> mode

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
button and that exit out of jiggle mode

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.990 
button and that exit out of jiggle mode
so<00:02:08.789> that's<00:02:09.030> how<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.270> move<00:02:09.629> an<00:02:09.929> app<00:02:10.709> icon<00:02:11.129> now

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
so that's how you move an app icon now

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.580 
so that's how you move an app icon now
how<00:02:12.180> would<00:02:12.239> you<00:02:12.510> delete<00:02:12.870> an<00:02:13.110> app

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
how would you delete an app

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.320 
how would you delete an app
well<00:02:13.980> again<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.400> can<00:02:14.519> only<00:02:14.700> delete<00:02:15.060> certain

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
well again you can only delete certain

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.479 
well again you can only delete certain
apps<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:15.690> can<00:02:15.750> only<00:02:16.019> delete<00:02:16.489> applications

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
apps you can only delete applications

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.100 
apps you can only delete applications
that<00:02:17.940> you've<00:02:18.120> downloaded<00:02:18.390> from<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:18.930> App

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
that you've downloaded from the App

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.190 
that you've downloaded from the App
Store<00:02:19.410> so<00:02:20.220> that<00:02:20.370> means<00:02:20.580> any<00:02:20.879> of<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.300> apps<00:02:21.870> that

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
Store so that means any of the apps that

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.470 
Store so that means any of the apps that
are<00:02:22.319> not<00:02:22.500> stock<00:02:22.890> applications<00:02:23.640> for<00:02:24.150> instance

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
are not stock applications for instance

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.860 
are not stock applications for instance
like<00:02:24.629> Pandora<00:02:25.230> or<00:02:25.530> skype<00:02:26.280> or<00:02:26.580> reader<00:02:26.790> so<00:02:27.660> let's

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
like Pandora or skype or reader so let's

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.039 
like Pandora or skype or reader so let's
get<00:02:28.050> back<00:02:28.230> in<00:02:28.379> the<00:02:28.470> jiggle<00:02:28.769> mode<00:02:29.629> and<00:02:30.629> now

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
get back in the jiggle mode and now

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.410 
get back in the jiggle mode and now
there's<00:02:31.440> quite<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:31.980> few<00:02:32.040> applications<00:02:32.970> here

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
there's quite a few applications here

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.420 
there's quite a few applications here
most<00:02:34.170> of<00:02:34.319> them<00:02:34.470> on<00:02:34.620> this<00:02:34.769> screen<00:02:34.950> our<00:02:35.190> stock

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
most of them on this screen our stock

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.920 
most of them on this screen our stock
applications<00:02:36.150> hence<00:02:36.299> you<00:02:36.480> cannot<00:02:36.780> delete

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
applications hence you cannot delete

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.410 
applications hence you cannot delete
them<00:02:37.260> but<00:02:37.890> if<00:02:38.129> you<00:02:38.220> page<00:02:38.430> over<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:39.120> can<00:02:39.239> see
