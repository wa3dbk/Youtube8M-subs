for<00:04:09.360> the<00:04:09.780> house<00:04:09.959> or<00:04:10.500> at<00:04:10.620> least<00:04:10.770> one<00:04:11.010> of<00:04:11.100> the

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
for the house or at least one of the

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.630 
for the house or at least one of the
house<00:04:11.310> rooms<00:04:12.050> now<00:04:13.050> I<00:04:13.110> I<00:04:13.200> did<00:04:13.620> record<00:04:14.010> this<00:04:14.250> but

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
house rooms now I I did record this but

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.820 
house rooms now I I did record this but
it<00:04:17.640> really<00:04:18.000> did<00:04:18.299> not<00:04:18.590> something<00:04:19.590> was<00:04:19.709> wrong

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
it really did not something was wrong

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.409 
it really did not something was wrong
with<00:04:19.980> the<00:04:20.100> video<00:04:20.220> like<00:04:20.790> I<00:04:20.910> don't<00:04:21.090> know<00:04:21.150> I<00:04:21.359> think

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
with the video like I don't know I think

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.030 
with the video like I don't know I think
I<00:04:21.570> had<00:04:21.720> it<00:04:21.810> on<00:04:21.870> four<00:04:22.169> by<00:04:22.320> three<00:04:22.350> or<00:04:22.740> something

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
I had it on four by three or something

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.880 
I had it on four by three or something
everything<00:04:23.310> looks<00:04:23.460> look<00:04:23.850> stretched<00:04:24.830> so<00:04:25.830> I

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
everything looks look stretched so I

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:26.830 
everything looks look stretched so I
didn't<00:04:26.070> even<00:04:26.160> want<00:04:26.340> to<00:04:26.370> show

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
didn't even want to show

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.450 
didn't even want to show
was<00:04:26.990> pretty<00:04:27.260> boring<00:04:27.500> anyways<00:04:27.919> very

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
was pretty boring anyways very

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.129 
was pretty boring anyways very
repetitive<00:04:28.760> as<00:04:29.449> you<00:04:29.540> can<00:04:29.660> see<00:04:29.840> I<00:04:29.870> used

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
repetitive as you can see I used

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.650 
repetitive as you can see I used
redstone<00:04:30.650> all<00:04:30.919> along<00:04:31.130> the<00:04:31.250> top<00:04:31.460> here<00:04:31.660> and

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
redstone all along the top here and

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.900 
redstone all along the top here and
underneath<00:04:33.320> the<00:04:33.530> these<00:04:34.220> blocks<00:04:34.550> here<00:04:34.730> I<00:04:34.760> have

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
underneath the these blocks here I have

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.030 
underneath the these blocks here I have
pistons<00:04:35.449> and<00:04:35.780> the<00:04:36.199> pistons<00:04:36.620> cut<00:04:36.889> the

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
pistons and the pistons cut the

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.060 
pistons and the pistons cut the
sugarcane<00:04:37.690> the<00:04:38.690> only<00:04:38.960> thing<00:04:39.169> is<00:04:39.350> I<00:04:39.530> have<00:04:39.800> to<00:04:39.949> go

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
sugarcane the only thing is I have to go

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.610 
sugarcane the only thing is I have to go
and<00:04:40.190> collect<00:04:40.370> it<00:04:41.229> which<00:04:42.229> is<00:04:42.729> not<00:04:43.729> fun

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
and collect it which is not fun

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.650 
and collect it which is not fun
but<00:04:45.620> it's<00:04:46.400> the<00:04:46.580> only<00:04:46.790> way<00:04:47.120> I<00:04:47.150> could<00:04:47.360> figure<00:04:47.570> out

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
but it's the only way I could figure out

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.980 
but it's the only way I could figure out
how<00:04:47.870> to<00:04:47.930> do<00:04:48.080> it<00:04:48.280> efficiently<00:04:49.280> I<00:04:50.150> originally

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
how to do it efficiently I originally

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.670 
how to do it efficiently I originally
had<00:04:51.190> a<00:04:52.190> couple<00:04:52.639> spaces<00:04:53.240> and<00:04:53.510> then<00:04:53.660> water<00:04:53.960> but

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
had a couple spaces and then water but

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.740 
had a couple spaces and then water but
some<00:04:55.160> of<00:04:55.280> the<00:04:55.340> sugarcane<00:04:55.669> would<00:04:56.180> drop<00:04:56.449> on<00:04:56.660> the

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
some of the sugarcane would drop on the

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.060 
some of the sugarcane would drop on the
water<00:04:56.930> and<00:04:57.139> some<00:04:57.320> would<00:04:57.440> drop<00:04:57.620> right<00:04:57.830> here<00:04:57.979> on

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
water and some would drop right here on

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.620 
water and some would drop right here on
the<00:04:58.160> ground<00:04:58.460> and<00:04:58.790> I'd<00:04:59.090> have<00:04:59.270> to<00:04:59.300> go<00:04:59.450> and

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
the ground and I'd have to go and

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.450 
the ground and I'd have to go and
collect<00:04:59.780> them<00:05:00.050> manually<00:05:00.320> anyways<00:05:00.710> this<00:05:01.250> way<00:05:01.430> I

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
collect them manually anyways this way I

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.070 
collect them manually anyways this way I
have<00:05:01.700> to<00:05:01.790> collect<00:05:01.910> everything<00:05:02.450> manually<00:05:02.780> but

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
have to collect everything manually but

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.940 
have to collect everything manually but
it<00:05:03.260> all<00:05:03.380> gets<00:05:03.560> cut<00:05:03.889> automatically<00:05:04.580> for<00:05:04.790> me<00:05:05.950> BAM

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
it all gets cut automatically for me BAM

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.000 
it all gets cut automatically for me BAM
did<00:05:07.190> you<00:05:07.280> hear<00:05:07.430> that<00:05:07.510> Pistons<00:05:08.510> at<00:05:08.690> work<00:05:08.950> so<00:05:09.950> I

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
did you hear that Pistons at work so I

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.840 
did you hear that Pistons at work so I
just<00:05:10.220> walk<00:05:10.490> through<00:05:10.520> and<00:05:11.180> collect<00:05:12.639> from<00:05:13.639> each

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
just walk through and collect from each

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:20.740 
just walk through and collect from each
row<00:05:14.120> kind<00:05:14.900> of<00:05:15.020> like<00:05:15.110> a<00:05:15.139> farmer<00:05:18.340> and<00:05:19.340> it<00:05:19.940> is<00:05:20.090> 100%

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
row kind of like a farmer and it is 100%

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.170 
row kind of like a farmer and it is 100%
efficient<00:05:21.710> I<00:05:21.770> tested<00:05:22.190> it<00:05:22.250> just<00:05:22.550> off<00:05:22.700> camera

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
efficient I tested it just off camera

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:28.270 
efficient I tested it just off camera
just<00:05:23.210> before<00:05:23.660> I<00:05:23.690> started<00:05:23.990> recording<00:05:24.169> and<00:05:27.280> none

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
just before I started recording and none

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.770 
just before I started recording and none
of<00:05:28.310> the<00:05:28.520> reeds<00:05:28.729> or<00:05:29.180> none<00:05:29.330> of<00:05:29.419> the<00:05:29.479> sugarcane

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
of the reeds or none of the sugarcane

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.590 
of the reeds or none of the sugarcane
falls<00:05:30.289> in<00:05:30.500> the<00:05:30.590> water<00:05:30.740> it<00:05:31.039> all<00:05:31.310> falls<00:05:31.669> right

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 
falls in the water it all falls right

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.180 
falls in the water it all falls right
here<00:05:32.930> where<00:05:33.110> it<00:05:33.200> should<00:05:35.139> and<00:05:36.139> like<00:05:36.380> I<00:05:36.470> said<00:05:36.530> 100

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
here where it should and like I said 100

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.980 
here where it should and like I said 100
percent<00:05:37.490> of<00:05:37.580> fishing<00:05:37.910> I<00:05:38.060> get<00:05:38.270> every<00:05:38.660> single

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
percent of fishing I get every single

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.810 
percent of fishing I get every single
piece<00:05:39.169> nothing<00:05:40.130> left<00:05:40.310> behind<00:05:40.520> actually

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
piece nothing left behind actually

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.390 
piece nothing left behind actually
should<00:05:41.210> put<00:05:41.330> a<00:05:41.389> door<00:05:41.600> right<00:05:41.840> here<00:05:42.169> be<00:05:43.099> kind<00:05:43.340> of

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
should put a door right here be kind of

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.350 
should put a door right here be kind of
convenient<00:05:43.810> might<00:05:44.810> do<00:05:44.960> that<00:05:45.280> so<00:05:46.280> yeah<00:05:47.120> so

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
convenient might do that so yeah so

can see it got me I know what's that
eighty<00:05:57.770> ninety<00:05:58.270> to<00:06:00.490> ninety<00:06:01.490> two<00:06:01.520> sugar<00:06:01.849> canes

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 
eighty ninety to ninety two sugar canes

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.089 
eighty ninety to ninety two sugar canes
and<00:06:02.330> they<00:06:02.510> weren't<00:06:02.690> completely<00:06:03.289> grown<00:06:03.830> so

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:04.099 
and they weren't completely grown so

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:05.350 
and they weren't completely grown so
that's<00:06:04.280> why<00:06:04.400> I<00:06:04.430> didn't<00:06:04.639> get<00:06:04.760> a<00:06:04.820> full<00:06:05.120> two

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 
that's why I didn't get a full two

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.250 
that's why I didn't get a full two
stacks<00:06:05.690> of<00:06:05.900> 64<00:06:06.470> but<00:06:07.070> yeah<00:06:07.820> so<00:06:08.570> let<00:06:09.110> me<00:06:09.169> know

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.550 
what you guys think about that I think
it's<00:06:10.789> pretty<00:06:11.210> cool<00:06:11.599> I<00:06:11.870> wanted<00:06:12.169> to<00:06:12.229> make<00:06:12.380> it<00:06:12.470> all

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
it's pretty cool I wanted to make it all

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.560 
it's pretty cool I wanted to make it all
automated<00:06:13.280> so<00:06:13.430> that<00:06:13.490> it<00:06:13.970> all<00:06:14.090> falls<00:06:14.360> in<00:06:14.510> the

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:14.570 
automated so that it all falls in the

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.390 
automated so that it all falls in the
water<00:06:14.840> and<00:06:15.200> then<00:06:15.320> all<00:06:15.440> the<00:06:15.590> water<00:06:15.770> carries<00:06:16.280> it

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 
water and then all the water carries it

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.350 
water and then all the water carries it
to<00:06:16.550> a<00:06:16.580> central<00:06:17.150> location<00:06:18.220> but<00:06:19.220> that<00:06:20.120> didn't

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 
to a central location but that didn't

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.150 
to a central location but that didn't
work<00:06:20.389> out<00:06:20.630> very<00:06:20.690> well<00:06:20.930> because<00:06:21.229> they<00:06:21.740> they

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.160 
work out very well because they they

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.320 
work out very well because they they
would<00:06:22.280> all<00:06:22.400> no<00:06:22.580> matter<00:06:22.729> what<00:06:22.940> I<00:06:22.970> did<00:06:23.090> they

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.330 
would all no matter what I did they

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.120 
would all no matter what I did they
would<00:06:23.450> all<00:06:23.599> fall<00:06:23.990> some<00:06:24.500> of<00:06:24.590> them<00:06:24.710> anyways

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:25.130 
would all fall some of them anyways

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:29.409 
would all fall some of them anyways
would<00:06:25.310> all<00:06:25.490> fall<00:06:26.830> right<00:06:27.830> directly<00:06:28.700> below<00:06:28.910> it

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:29.419 
would all fall right directly below it

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:33.719 
would all fall right directly below it
wouldn't<00:06:29.990> be<00:06:30.320> pushed<00:06:30.590> forward<00:06:31.750> so<00:06:32.750> yeah

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:33.729 
wouldn't be pushed forward so yeah

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:36.279 
wouldn't be pushed forward so yeah
