00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
in terms of Silver's playthrough I think

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.690 
in terms of Silver's playthrough I think
I<00:00:06.810> reached<00:00:07.470> my<00:00:07.680> peak<00:00:07.740> with<00:00:08.189> hats<00:00:08.429> in<00:00:08.580> the

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.410 
pigeon and I don't think it's going to
get<00:00:11.070> any<00:00:11.219> better<00:00:11.429> than<00:00:11.610> that<00:00:11.670> so<00:00:12.090> with<00:00:12.300> that

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420
