the<00:01:23.159> important<00:01:23.580> bit<00:01:23.729> was<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.150> there's<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.509> 10

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
the important bit was so there's a 10

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.780 
the important bit was so there's a 10
ohm<00:01:24.780> resistor<00:01:25.290> here<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.740> gone<00:01:25.950> open<00:01:26.100> circuit

I'm<00:01:27.689> hoping<00:01:28.110> this<00:01:28.500> IC<00:01:29.250> he<00:01:29.400> was<00:01:29.490> blown<00:01:29.729> up

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
I'm hoping this IC he was blown up

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.819 
I'm hoping this IC he was blown up
haven't<00:01:30.210> tried<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.509> yet<00:01:30.630> but<00:01:30.810> if<00:01:31.320> this<00:01:31.560> doesn't

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
haven't tried it yet but if this doesn't

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.340 
haven't tried it yet but if this doesn't
work<00:01:31.920> then<00:01:32.070> I'll<00:01:32.400> edit<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.880> video<00:01:33.350> I've

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
work then I'll edit this video I've

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.920 
work then I'll edit this video I've
changed<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:34.770> chip<00:01:35.070> got<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.549> from<00:01:35.759> eBay<00:01:36.420> for<00:01:36.630> a

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
changed this chip got it from eBay for a

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.100 
changed this chip got it from eBay for a
cup<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.079> pound<00:01:37.380> change<00:01:38.250> this<00:01:38.369> one<00:01:39.299> off<00:01:39.570> put<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.869> 1

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
cup of pound change this one off put a 1

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.440 
cup of pound change this one off put a 1
watt<00:01:40.320> resistor<00:01:40.799> turn<00:01:41.220> on<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.579> think<00:01:42.210> the

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
watt resistor turn on I think the

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.060 
watt resistor turn on I think the
original<00:01:42.630> was<00:01:42.960> probably<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.290> little<00:01:43.560> bit<00:01:43.890> less

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
original was probably a little bit less

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.420 
original was probably a little bit less
than<00:01:44.250> 1<00:01:44.460> watt<00:01:45.170> but<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.259> important<00:01:46.799> bit<00:01:46.979> which

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
than 1 watt but the important bit which

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.520 
than 1 watt but the important bit which
is<00:01:47.460> why<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.729> thought<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:47.939> did<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.210> video<00:01:48.390> on<00:01:50.119> back

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
is why I thought I did a video on back

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.830 
is why I thought I did a video on back
let's<00:01:52.530> be<00:01:53.390> focused<00:01:54.390> in

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.770 
resistors here that 1 point 8 ohms each
one<00:02:24.980> point<00:02:25.250> eight<00:02:25.459> and<00:02:25.670> then<00:02:26.269> this<00:02:26.390> one<00:02:26.599> here

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
one point eight and then this one here

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.160 
one point eight and then this one here
is<00:02:27.050> a<00:02:27.080> 10<00:02:27.380> ohm<00:02:27.410> and<00:02:27.769> it's<00:02:27.920> in<00:02:28.069> parallel<00:02:28.580> so<00:02:28.610> the

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
is a 10 ohm and it's in parallel so the

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.430 
is a 10 ohm and it's in parallel so the
effective<00:02:30.170> resistance<00:02:30.500> is<00:02:30.920> just<00:02:31.160> under

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
effective resistance is just under

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.570 
effective resistance is just under
roughly<00:02:33.440> port<00:02:33.650> nine<00:02:33.860> over<00:02:34.100> nine<00:02:34.130> something

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
roughly port nine over nine something

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.270 
roughly port nine over nine something
like<00:02:34.819> that<00:02:35.110> but<00:02:36.110> yeah<00:02:36.500> I<00:02:36.530> thought<00:02:36.769> if<00:02:36.950> you<00:02:37.069> live

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
like that but yeah I thought if you live

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.190 
like that but yeah I thought if you live
in<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:37.730> same<00:02:37.910> boat<00:02:38.150> as<00:02:38.330> mean<00:02:38.540> you<00:02:38.780> don't<00:02:38.930> need

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
in the same boat as mean you don't need

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.620 
in the same boat as mean you don't need
to<00:02:39.319> know<00:02:39.440> what<00:02:39.739> these<00:02:39.890> resistors<00:02:40.340> are<00:02:40.519> 1<00:02:41.450> point

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
to know what these resistors are 1 point

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:42.220 
to know what these resistors are 1 point
8<00:02:41.810> ohms

1.8<00:02:42.920> ohms<00:02:43.160> and<00:02:43.549> 10<00:02:43.880> ohms<00:02:45.069> hopefully<00:02:46.069> that's

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
1.8 ohms and 10 ohms hopefully that's

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.539 
1.8 ohms and 10 ohms hopefully that's
all<00:02:46.670> that<00:02:47.150> sort<00:02:47.390> of<00:02:47.420> uh<00:02:47.569> blows<00:02:48.019> up<00:02:48.200> on<00:02:48.319> these

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
all that sort of uh blows up on these

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.300 
all that sort of uh blows up on these

various kitchen boy for about 20 pound

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.780 
various kitchen boy for about 20 pound
but<00:03:14.090> the<00:03:14.750> kit<00:03:14.959> didn't<00:03:15.410> include<00:03:15.769> these<00:03:15.920> two

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
but the kit didn't include these two

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.599 
but the kit didn't include these two
components<00:03:17.290> or<00:03:18.290> three<00:03:18.500> components<00:03:19.130> so<00:03:19.549> I

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
components or three components so I

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.539 
components or three components so I
thought<00:03:19.819> did<00:03:20.090> this<00:03:20.239> video<00:03:21.100> as<00:03:22.100> I<00:03:22.190> say<00:03:22.340> this

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
thought did this video as I say this

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:28.539 
thought did this video as I say this
one's<00:03:22.940> for<00:03:23.120> Polaroid<00:03:23.620> 37<00:03:24.620> inch<00:03:25.180> LCD<00:03:27.549> thank

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
one's for Polaroid 37 inch LCD thank

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:36.830 
one's for Polaroid 37 inch LCD thank
very<00:03:28.639> much

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840
