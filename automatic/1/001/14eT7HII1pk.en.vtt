00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:14.440
 by me 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.440
 no no no 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.500
 hello girls how are you today 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.570
 let's have this look a bit 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.910
 spring and a little also claim 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.910
 also can to go back the place 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.009
 let's use three colors of clear 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.960
 dark and this palette does not have anything of 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.090
 name you can take any palette that 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.360
 you have in your house take advantage of the one 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.190
 ok have at home will put the 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.440
 three tones and we 're going to put it first in 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.170
 the outside part one in the basin one 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.989
 in the part of the writing of our 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.530
 eyelid and the other one we are going to put 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.530
 over 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.300
 I'm going to use this mac shadow that I already 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.070
 I told them that I had bought it because 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.950
 I loved the color how it looked and 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.930
 everything is a very, very beautiful color of 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.970
 true that I fell in love with this one 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.369
 even more when I used it for this 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.720
 makeup and we're going to put it only 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.520
 up to the middle of our eyelid and 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.700
 we are going to blur a bit with the 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.350
 brown shade the brown we have there and 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.479
 then we are going to use a little more 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.130
 coffee to hide a little that 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.130
 union between those two colors 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.740
 ok in this way with this brush let's go 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.630
 to go putting a little more color 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.729
 I will also use a little gel 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.649
 and we're just going to put it on 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.860
 the tabs and we will put it without 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:45.830
 Touch the lacrimal only I do not know 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.590
 where that area comes off until the 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.570
 part of outside ok and then let's put 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.289
 again the same shadow and we're going to 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.289
 put down 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.690
 ok well then let's outline I'm going to 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.060
 use this eyeliner that you already know 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.040
 I'm thinking a lot and we're going to do 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.440
 an outline that is only seen in the 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.480
 little tail just let's do normal 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.860
 but bound but in the tail 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.110
 only since I want it to look 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.360
 because this makeup is not going to see 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.370
 too much delineated because only 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.890
 I'm doing it thin only for 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:43.080
 can put the tab and can not be 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.080
 one to bring up what you demand 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.620
 well now I'm going to use these two 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.520
 false eyelashes that are de luxe and the 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.400
 and the two combined are 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.530
 in oysters and well I'm going to put these two 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.480
 I love these two really do not 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.450
 I know why but they do the look 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.580
 much more striking and help 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.520
 very much the makeup so it looks 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.770
 Super more eye-catching eyes makes them 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.500
 more expressive and that's what I like 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.960
 first we put this but I do not know how 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.300
 call the pronunciation I do not know girls 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:30.990
 because it has a half-rare name 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.910
 two this the two tabs but in the 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.550
 previous chapter have seen the 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.610
 names what I'm going to use my mask 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:41.600
 of eyelashes and we're going to spend a lot 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.600
 First 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.490
 then I'm going to take a little bit of this 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.650
 palette of british factor and number 06 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.110
 and let's take a green with a little 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.140
 yellow and we will only locate it 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.330
 a little on what is the tear that 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:16.380
 I'm going to use this orange lipstick 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.850
 with a little concealer the lipstick does not 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.650
 It has the name of girls because I 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.959
 I lost the cap and they have the cap 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:26.570

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.570

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.650
