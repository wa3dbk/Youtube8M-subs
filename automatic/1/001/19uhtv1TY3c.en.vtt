00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.089
 Hi girls 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.070
 today I take you to my yard 

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:14.440
 back side it's super nice and then 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.700
 summer has arrived today so has 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.530
 ariel for beginners 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.540
 I go up to realize this crate there 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.600
 really easily if the see how 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.890
 realize it and we start our 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.180
 for the tutorial you are going to need 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.770
 of a brush and transparent africa 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.760
 can also have a little fantasy 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:35.410
 like a loop is a mirror 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.030
 first chance we will do we go 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.480
 brush the hair in the direction of 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.769
 what we want to have our press a 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.199
 once it's done you 'll play by 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:46.839
 and your hair in three parts of which 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:50.289
 you have made bulk 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:52.800
 a few more movies have joined the 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:52.800
 isolate 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.749
 so we start with the first part 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.629
 open regular press and then if by 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.339
 example you have more hair 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.810
 short or negative can always 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.560
 use spiny beards to maintain 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:15.619
 your hair in place so we do a 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.619
 almost light down 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.480
 once it's going to be done we want 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:25.660
 let go of curzi is not there too much series because 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.330
 we will play in it so we need 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.820
 to draw from the mass reform just that 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.680
 it is a beautiful crisis in one time 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.100
 that it's done we secure with one the 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.100
 elastic 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.290
 then we leave a medium that was 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.670
 this one are there puppies are your 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.240
 use it at the very end 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.510
 we take our biggest expression in 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:53.110
 keeping three to make it braid on 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.970
 go take the three like this here the one 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.730
 we hold here will go into weaving 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.600
 same place then that of 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:04.390
 the end outside your thoughts get 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:08.920
 care for the better then explained under 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.780
 the one known under the eyes open 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.250
 youssou the circles and then we continue 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.250
 like that just down 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.250
 it takes a little practice is not it 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.100
 who are you on barbiturates cork 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.160
 like me I did I come pretty 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.460
 easy and fast we are able to do 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.860
 without looking and then thinking about it after 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:33.800
 once that ended that here we go 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.220
 secure again you're here he 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.700
 we stay the middle one we go the 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.860
 take 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.570
 and then we will go there knitted solid 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.850
 it's the easiest way 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.730
 and then it's really the same 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.140
 result and I find that a braid to 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.970
 five branches or even four 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.610
 branches that got much more 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.340
 fast by countering the middle one we're going 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.240
 go to open an advertisement of our press 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:02.270
 and then we go below 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:04.340
 lens by the hole like that then we go 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.320
 go take the same thing a rings 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.370
 on the other side and then we will pass it 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.370
 Above 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.940
 she's going out like this here so both 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:20.750
 are attached to baba sy below by 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.750
 there we 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.860
 the more we will make a new one to us from 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:30.030
 the oppression goes over it we go 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:35.090
 do that just has that once 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.090
 happens in the end we remove or stay 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.480
 we can also cut them 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.700
 for some do not break my hair 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.730
 we will take the next 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.740
 are you going to secure it all together 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:52.160
 today to go with how I 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.560
 am dressed i will go to kitimat 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:04:00.280
 runs the limit a little pass like 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.280
 this here above all space springs 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:09.450
 it would be better and here is the dock 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.640
 complete so will even come out a little 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.980
 little bit your bangs bring out little ones 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.410
 hair like that here it gave you a 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.270
 big stress like that super easy to 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.970
 realize that mangala do it as much as 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:23.700
 dried by a regular presence 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.140
 Well, it gives that so I hope you 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.430

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:32.570
