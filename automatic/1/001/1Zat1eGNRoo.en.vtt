question<00:01:55.030> marks<00:01:55.270> about<00:01:55.390> this<00:01:55.689> game<00:01:55.869> this<00:01:55.990> is<00:01:56.590> a

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
question marks about this game this is a

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:58.230 
question marks about this game this is a
volatile<00:01:57.100> game<00:01:57.369> simply<00:01:57.670> because<00:01:57.970> you<00:01:58.000> have

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
volatile game simply because you have

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.210 
volatile game simply because you have
the<00:01:58.689> best<00:01:58.900> team<00:01:59.170> but<00:01:59.740> we<00:01:59.830> don't<00:02:00.010> know<00:02:00.100> what

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
the best team but we don't know what

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.710 
the best team but we don't know what
we're<00:02:00.340> going<00:02:00.430> to<00:02:00.520> get<00:02:00.640> from<00:02:00.820> them<00:02:01.000> and<00:02:01.360> i<00:02:01.509> think

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
we're going to get from them and i think

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.929 
we're going to get from them and i think
i<00:02:01.750> said<00:02:02.320> before<00:02:02.409> republic<00:02:03.189> of<00:02:03.280> ireland<00:02:03.610> will

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
i said before republic of ireland will

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:05.580 
i said before republic of ireland will
set<00:02:04.240> a<00:02:04.270> standard<00:02:04.509> we<00:02:04.750> know<00:02:04.930> that<00:02:05.140> republic<00:02:05.530> of

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
set a standard we know that republic of

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.230 
set a standard we know that republic of
ireland<00:02:05.860> will<00:02:05.950> play<00:02:06.130> a<00:02:06.159> certain<00:02:06.430> way<00:02:06.729> and<00:02:06.939> will

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
ireland will play a certain way and will

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.300 
ireland will play a certain way and will
play<00:02:07.390> well<00:02:07.689> the<00:02:08.289> problem<00:02:08.619> is<00:02:08.709> if<00:02:08.830> France<00:02:09.069> play

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
play well the problem is if France play

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.039 
play well the problem is if France play
well<00:02:09.519> and<00:02:09.970> if<00:02:10.209> they<00:02:10.330> do<00:02:10.390> then<00:02:10.659> France<00:02:10.869> will

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.049 
well and if they do then France will

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:12.809 
well and if they do then France will
probably<00:02:11.290> win<00:02:11.409> the<00:02:11.500> game<00:02:11.620> if<00:02:11.769> they<00:02:11.860> done<00:02:12.069> the

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
probably win the game if they done the

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.069 
probably win the game if they done the
Republic<00:02:13.269> are<00:02:13.359> going<00:02:13.480> to<00:02:13.540> be<00:02:13.629> more<00:02:13.840> than<00:02:13.900> a

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:14.079 
Republic are going to be more than a

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:15.050

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
ever you're absolutely right if you

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.729
