of those type of shots in my opinion I

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.630 
of those type of shots in my opinion I
don't<00:01:10.080> think<00:01:10.290> that's<00:01:10.619> right<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.100> as<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.490> can

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
don't think that's right and as you can

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.359 
don't think that's right and as you can
see<00:01:11.670> with<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.090> stats<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.689> actually<00:01:13.049> think<00:01:13.560> just

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369

see with the stats I actually think just
to<00:01:14.520> be<00:01:14.640> safe<00:01:14.880> just<00:01:15.390> look<00:01:15.570> at<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.750> like<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.290> need

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
to be safe just look at it like you need

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.160 
to be safe just look at it like you need
to<00:01:16.740> make<00:01:17.180> 200<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.270> those<00:01:18.420> shots<00:01:18.689> because<00:01:18.960> you

what<00:02:13.510> I<00:02:13.540> did<00:02:13.870> as<00:02:14.380> you<00:02:14.830> can<00:02:14.980> see<00:02:15.160> with<00:02:15.280> that<00:02:15.430> shot

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
what I did as you can see with that shot

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.490 
what I did as you can see with that shot
there<00:02:15.970> what's<00:02:16.390> easier<00:02:16.750> fading<00:02:17.050> away<00:02:17.170> from

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
there what's easier fading away from

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
there what's easier fading away from
3-point<00:02:18.280> range<00:02:18.340> 23<00:02:19.180> 24<00:02:19.660> feet<00:02:19.960> out<00:02:20.140> or<00:02:20.980> fading

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
3-point range 23 24 feet out or fading

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.060 
3-point range 23 24 feet out or fading
away<00:02:21.610> from<00:02:21.880> 10<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.240> 15<00:02:22.660> feet<00:02:22.870> out<00:02:23.080> which<00:02:23.890> is

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
away from 10 to 15 feet out which is

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.800 
away from 10 to 15 feet out which is
what<00:02:24.250> I<00:02:24.280> did<00:02:24.610> that's<00:02:24.880> so<00:02:24.970> again<00:02:25.360> that's<00:02:25.570> my

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
what I did that's so again that's my

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.510 
what I did that's so again that's my
technique<00:02:26.260> it's<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.650> easiest<00:02:27.010> way<00:02:27.250> to<00:02:27.310> unlock

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
technique it's the easiest way to unlock

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.250 
technique it's the easiest way to unlock
shot<00:02:27.940> created<00:02:28.390> in<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.540> shortest<00:02:28.870> amount<00:02:29.050> of

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
shot created in the shortest amount of

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.400 
shot created in the shortest amount of
time<00:02:29.670> it's<00:02:30.670> kind<00:02:30.880> of<00:02:30.970> cheesy<00:02:31.210> to<00:02:31.900> me<00:02:31.930> it<00:02:32.230> feels

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
time it's kind of cheesy to me it feels

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.230 
time it's kind of cheesy to me it feels
like<00:02:32.680> but<00:02:33.640> it<00:02:33.970> works<00:02:34.210> so<00:02:34.690> as<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:36.400> can<00:02:36.850> see<00:02:37.090> with

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
like but it works so as you can see with

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.880 
like but it works so as you can see with
that<00:02:37.300> last<00:02:37.660> shot<00:02:37.870> I<00:02:37.930> made<00:02:38.230> what<00:02:38.470> you<00:02:38.620> want<00:02:38.800> to

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
that last shot I made what you want to

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.090 
that last shot I made what you want to
do<00:02:39.100> is<00:02:39.540> just<00:02:40.540> take<00:02:40.690> that<00:02:40.870> spin<00:02:41.230> shot<00:02:41.470> jumper<00:02:41.950> in

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
do is just take that spin shot jumper in

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.070 
do is just take that spin shot jumper in
that<00:02:42.490> that<00:02:43.090> high<00:02:44.460> high<00:02:45.460> post<00:02:45.870> extended<00:02:46.870> area

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
that that high high post extended area

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.260 
that that high high post extended area
elbow<00:02:47.920> extended<00:02:48.490> area<00:02:50.459> between<00:02:51.459> the<00:02:51.730> baseline

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
elbow extended area between the baseline

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.470 
elbow extended area between the baseline
and<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.540> wing<00:02:52.720> that<00:02:53.350> to<00:02:53.830> me<00:02:54.010> again<00:02:54.970> there<00:02:55.360> you

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
and the wing that to me again there you

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.350 
and the wing that to me again there you
see<00:02:55.660> it's<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:56.770> easiest<00:02:57.160> shot<00:02:57.459> that<00:02:58.000> you<00:02:58.150> can

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
see it's the easiest shot that you can

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.380 
see it's the easiest shot that you can
make<00:02:58.540> out<00:02:58.750> of<00:02:58.900> those<00:02:59.020> shots<00:02:59.910> in<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.060> shortest

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
make out of those shots in the shortest

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.070 
make out of those shots in the shortest
amount<00:03:01.540> of<00:03:01.750> time<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:02.880> so<00:03:03.880> in<00:03:04.240> order<00:03:04.690> to<00:03:04.840> do

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
amount of time and so in order to do

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.440 
amount of time and so in order to do
that<00:03:05.260> spin<00:03:05.709> shot<00:03:05.950> for<00:03:06.850> those<00:03:07.000> of<00:03:07.180> you<00:03:07.300> that

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
that spin shot for those of you that

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.960 
that spin shot for those of you that
aren't<00:03:07.660> familiar<00:03:08.100> all<00:03:09.100> that<00:03:09.400> you<00:03:09.520> want<00:03:09.730> to<00:03:09.790> do

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
aren't familiar all that you want to do

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.770 
aren't familiar all that you want to do
is<00:03:10.240> double<00:03:10.930> tap<00:03:11.170> square<00:03:12.030> and<00:03:13.030> that<00:03:13.209> will<00:03:13.390> put

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
is double tap square and that will put

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.780 
is double tap square and that will put
you<00:03:13.930> into<00:03:14.080> that<00:03:14.260> spin<00:03:14.590> shot<00:03:14.800> animation<00:03:15.580> and

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
you into that spin shot animation and

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.509 
you into that spin shot animation and
then<00:03:16.270> from<00:03:16.570> there<00:03:16.630> you<00:03:16.930> just<00:03:17.100> you<00:03:18.100> want<00:03:18.340> to<00:03:18.400> get

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
then from there you just you want to get

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.930 
then from there you just you want to get
the<00:03:18.640> timing<00:03:18.940> down<00:03:19.140> this<00:03:20.250> for<00:03:21.250> shot<00:03:21.459> creator<00:03:21.850> I

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
the timing down this for shot creator I

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.780 
the timing down this for shot creator I
had<00:03:22.180> the<00:03:22.300> difficulty<00:03:22.900> on<00:03:23.050> rookie<00:03:23.739> in<00:03:24.489> the

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
had the difficulty on rookie in the

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.170 
had the difficulty on rookie in the
settings<00:03:25.239> on<00:03:25.390> casual<00:03:26.580> and<00:03:27.580> I<00:03:27.730> don't<00:03:27.940> know<00:03:28.060> if

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
settings on casual and I don't know if

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.940 
settings on casual and I don't know if
that<00:03:28.330> had<00:03:28.540> an<00:03:28.630> effect<00:03:28.720> on<00:03:29.110> how<00:03:29.290> quickly<00:03:29.620> it<00:03:29.830> was

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
that had an effect on how quickly it was

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.130 
that had an effect on how quickly it was
unlined<00:03:30.250> I<00:03:30.430> know<00:03:30.489> that<00:03:30.790> does<00:03:31.060> have<00:03:31.600> an<00:03:31.750> effect

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
unlined I know that does have an effect

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.190 
unlined I know that does have an effect
on<00:03:32.500> dead<00:03:32.800> i<00:03:32.830> but<00:03:33.340> in<00:03:33.850> my<00:03:34.120> experience<00:03:34.239> it<00:03:34.870> hasn't

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
on dead i but in my experience it hasn't

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.960 
on dead i but in my experience it hasn't
had<00:03:35.380> any<00:03:35.709> effect<00:03:35.920> on<00:03:36.310> any<00:03:36.550> of<00:03:36.700> the<00:03:36.820> other

had any effect on any of the other

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.130 
had any effect on any of the other
badges<00:03:37.500> so<00:03:39.030> yeah<00:03:40.030> that's<00:03:40.269> all<00:03:40.510> you<00:03:40.570> want<00:03:40.870> to<00:03:40.959> do

badges so yeah that's all you want to do

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.140 
badges so yeah that's all you want to do
is<00:03:41.620> a<00:03:42.120> again<00:03:43.120> in<00:03:43.269> that<00:03:43.390> elbow<00:03:43.959> extended<00:03:44.530> area

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
is a again in that elbow extended area

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.630 
is a again in that elbow extended area
pull<00:03:46.150> up<00:03:46.360> for<00:03:46.840> that<00:03:46.959> spin<00:03:47.350> shot<00:03:47.590> and<00:03:47.950> you<00:03:48.459> just

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
pull up for that spin shot and you just

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.729 
pull up for that spin shot and you just
want<00:03:48.850> to<00:03:48.910> get<00:03:49.030> that<00:03:49.209> once<00:03:50.050> you<00:03:50.230> double<00:03:50.560> tap

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
want to get that once you double tap

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.160 
want to get that once you double tap
square<00:03:51.130> on<00:03:51.400> that<00:03:51.610> second<00:03:52.090> tap<00:03:52.330> you'll<00:03:52.989> be

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
square on that second tap you'll be

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.620 
square on that second tap you'll be
holding<00:03:53.440> it<00:03:53.769> for<00:03:54.250> the<00:03:54.519> release<00:03:54.880> and<00:03:55.120> once<00:03:55.510> you

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
holding it for the release and once you

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.720 
holding it for the release and once you
do<00:03:55.780> it<00:03:55.930> if<00:03:56.050> you<00:03:56.170> haven't<00:03:56.350> done<00:03:56.560> it<00:03:56.620> before<00:03:57.040> once

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
do it if you haven't done it before once

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.280 
do it if you haven't done it before once
you<00:03:57.820> do<00:03:57.970> it<00:03:58.090> once<00:03:58.120> or<00:03:58.480> twice<00:03:58.600> you'll<00:03:58.989> get<00:03:59.170> the

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
you do it once or twice you'll get the

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.470 
you do it once or twice you'll get the
timing<00:03:59.560> down<00:03:59.709> and<00:04:00.190> and<00:04:00.370> get<00:04:00.820> a<00:04:00.850> feel<00:04:01.090> for<00:04:01.450> it

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
timing down and and get a feel for it

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.740 
timing down and and get a feel for it
it's<00:04:02.080> really<00:04:02.500> as<00:04:02.890> I<00:04:03.130> said<00:04:03.340> that's<00:04:03.580> why<00:04:04.300> I<00:04:04.330> did

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
it's really as I said that's why I did

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.660 
it's really as I said that's why I did
this<00:04:04.870> tutorial<00:04:05.500> for<00:04:05.680> use<00:04:05.860> that<00:04:06.100> in<00:04:06.310> my<00:04:06.340> opinion

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
this tutorial for use that in my opinion

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.410 
this tutorial for use that in my opinion
is<00:04:07.060> the<00:04:07.180> easiest<00:04:07.630> way<00:04:07.930> to<00:04:08.410> do<00:04:08.590> it<00:04:08.790> and<00:04:09.790> it's<00:04:10.330> a

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
is the easiest way to do it and it's a

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.620
