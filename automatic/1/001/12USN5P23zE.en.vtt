00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello everybody is not crazy and I will explain 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.060
 now for you on the concept of 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.730
 Geography geography is an image with 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.690
 three dimensions that shows the object as 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.910
 one all 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.410
 that is, if you look ahead you will see 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.480
 the front of the image 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.490
 but it was there from behind and see the back 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.070
 but we do not have the necessary materials 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.769
 to create this type of geography then 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.400
 brought you a demonstration today 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.560
 geography is only representative 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.560
 photo appears just as I am in a 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.809
 empty space do not need a place in 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.820
 that she transmits this is an illusion 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.350
 of optics where I can appear here 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.610
 as much as it may appear but wanted 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.610
 listen to music like this 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.850
 It's accurate as a river or astronaut. 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.110
 who brings text 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:04.000
 however I can then create the effect 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:07.190
 rain and atoa money two together and 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:17.770
 Can I bring a show from some star? 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:17.770
 famous amato fado 200 thousand 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.650
 mother called button 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:41.859
 So it 's good to spend Christmas 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.800
 there the 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:02:20.730
 It's the way it is not I can bring a 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:21.959
 famous tie playing video game and thousands 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.360
 of other things that I could not 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.280
 make an empty space like this can 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.330
 seems very difficult but it is not the will 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.060
 It's simple 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.580
 it took a projector a mirror one 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.010
 little video editing and a plain glass 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.530
 clean is the following our projector 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.780
 mirror image the mirror reflects the 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.860
 image I doubt the image is projected 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.739
 in a glass 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.050
 so it looks like it's in a vacuum 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.959
 to build this type of geography you 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.820
 need a video with he black background 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.100
 needs to be mirrored so that it does not 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.470
 head down when it is designed is 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.380
 the next everything is black on the video will not 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.750
 appear because the glass reflects the light 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.209
 us that is being launched on pedro will be 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.640
 reflected what is black I have no option 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.200
 emits light so it is not reflected 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.180
 Simple so now I'm going to show some 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.180
 effects in a place for you 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.220
 it's not talking too much 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.250
