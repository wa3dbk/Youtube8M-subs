00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.410
 m 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.660
 good the idea in this opportunity is 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.519
 show closely as solaris and 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.410
 artificial harmonics technique 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.839
 compound the technique is based 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.449
 directly on how we hit the string 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:55.070
 with the pick and what happens next 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.440
 us by blocking the rope with the 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.610
 barb in a normal attack we let the 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.610
 rope vibrate freely 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.790
 the case that we are in a harmonic 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:10.510
 artificially what we should do is leave 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:13.540
 just stick out the finger prick for 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.610
 that after the blow the finger tricks of 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.840
 the string to stop ringing 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.840
 generating this the harmonica 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.630
 in this case I hit the string with the 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.000
 pick and then the string hits the finger 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.610
 in this way the harmonic generates the 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.630
 rope is left mutilated 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.630
 calibrate freely 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.159
 a normal attack for the following form 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.720
 towards the rope leaving less free play 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.250
 and it depends on where we put the rope 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.620
 with your finger is going to generate different 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.009
 harmonics with other heights and different 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:13.100
 notes for example by clicking on the string 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.600
 3 the fret 9 but how to generate several 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.380
 harmonics depending on where 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.380
 let's attack the rope 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:31.110
 that goes a lot in the practice of each one 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.110
 in the taste in the note you want to achieve 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.050
 we repeat, reviewing the technique a bit 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.670
 which is very simple the idea is that the 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.010
 rope after being hit with the pick 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.260
 touch the finger so that this form leaves 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.890
 to live freely and get the 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.890
 harmonic you are looking for
