temperature if it's been wrapped in

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.580 
temperature if it's been wrapped in
plastic<00:00:16.560> for<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.070> long<00:00:17.220> time<00:00:17.810> it's<00:00:18.810> all<00:00:19.260> cling

wrap it's very good to just give the
surface<00:00:23.039> of<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.250> cheese<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.490> little<00:00:23.789> bit<00:00:23.939> of<00:00:24.000> a

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
surface of the cheese a little bit of a

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.759 
surface of the cheese a little bit of a
scrape<00:00:24.300> one<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:24.840> those<00:00:24.960> senses<00:00:25.500> that's

to taste it so I kind of roll it around

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.700 
to taste it so I kind of roll it around
a<00:01:07.970> little<00:01:08.970> bit<00:01:09.210> in<00:01:09.330> my<00:01:09.450> mouth<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:10.170> kind<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.470> warm

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
a little bit in my mouth to kind of warm

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.450 
a little bit in my mouth to kind of warm
it<00:01:10.799> up<00:01:10.920> slightly<00:01:11.729> some<00:01:12.510> people<00:01:13.430> like<00:01:14.430> to

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
it up slightly some people like to

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.980 
it up slightly some people like to
suppress<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.210> against<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.659> roof<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.960> your

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
suppress it against the roof of your

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.789 
suppress it against the roof of your
mouth<00:01:16.080> with<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.560> tongue<00:01:17.330> and<00:01:18.439> then<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.619> just

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
mouth with the tongue and then to just

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.179 
mouth with the tongue and then to just
sort<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.100> pay<00:01:20.310> attention<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.570> what's<00:01:21.750> going<00:01:21.990> on

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
sort of pay attention to what's going on

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:24.200 
sort of pay attention to what's going on
this<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.340> where<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.580> put<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:23.850> in<00:01:23.939> your<00:01:24.060> mouth

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
this is where you put it in your mouth

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.350 
this is where you put it in your mouth
right<00:01:24.979> and<00:01:25.979> what<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.220> look<00:01:26.549> for<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.060> sort<00:01:27.330> of

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
right and what I look for is a sort of

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.219 
right and what I look for is a sort of
slow<00:01:27.810> steady<00:01:28.710> build<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.670> flavor<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.329> it's

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
slow steady build of flavor so it's

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.830 
slow steady build of flavor so it's
rather<00:01:31.470> like<00:01:32.090> if<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.240> like<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.509> different

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
rather like if you like the different

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.630 
rather like if you like the different
instruments<00:01:34.439> in<00:01:34.530> an<00:01:34.650> orchestra<00:01:34.799> kind<00:01:35.549> of

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
instruments in an orchestra kind of

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.130 
instruments in an orchestra kind of
coming<00:01:35.970> together<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.420> should<00:01:36.570> be<00:01:36.869> able<00:01:37.049> to

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
coming together you should be able to

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.740 
coming together you should be able to
kind<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.439> pinpoint<00:01:38.430> them<00:01:38.880> as<00:01:39.000> individual

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
kind of pinpoint them as individual

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.630 
kind of pinpoint them as individual
things<00:01:40.049> but<00:01:40.770> they<00:01:40.920> should<00:01:41.100> also<00:01:41.280> work

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
things but they should also work

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.130 
things but they should also work
together<00:01:42.380> in<00:01:43.380> unison<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.360> and<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.689> get<00:01:45.990> this

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
together in unison so and you get this

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.080 
together in unison so and you get this
sort<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.439> slow<00:01:46.770> steady<00:01:47.189> build<00:01:47.549> up<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.030> the

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
sort of slow steady build up to the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.819 
sort of slow steady build up to the
point<00:01:48.149> where<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.720> kind<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:49.020> reaches<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.590> sort

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
point where it kind of reaches it sort

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.660 
point where it kind of reaches it sort
of<00:01:49.860> peak<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:51.149> then<00:01:51.780> as<00:01:52.350> importantly<00:01:53.280> and

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
of peak and then as importantly and

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.990 
of peak and then as importantly and
again<00:01:54.540> this<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.810> just<00:01:54.840> my<00:01:55.020> opinion<00:01:55.530> but<00:01:55.680> as

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
again this is just my opinion but as

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.969 
again this is just my opinion but as
importantly<00:01:57.000> as<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.240> how<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.570> leaves<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.380> so

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
importantly as to how it leaves and so

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.520 
importantly as to how it leaves and so
some<00:01:59.759> cheese's<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.780> know<00:02:00.899> you'll<00:02:01.049> get<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.259> much

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
some cheese's you know you'll get a much

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.910 
some cheese's you know you'll get a much
sharper<00:02:02.600> build<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.960> call<00:02:04.409> them<00:02:04.530> buggers

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
sharper build I call them buggers

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.609 
sharper build I call them buggers
cheese's<00:02:05.399> you<00:02:05.430> kind<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:05.790> get<00:02:05.939> hit<00:02:06.210> over<00:02:06.420> the

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
cheese's you kind of get hit over the

with with flavor but then the flavor

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.309 
with with flavor but then the flavor
kind<00:02:09.379> of<00:02:09.530> just<00:02:09.709> drops<00:02:09.979> off<00:02:10.220> completely<00:02:11.319> what

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
kind of just drops off completely what

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.170 
kind of just drops off completely what
personally<00:02:12.920> I<00:02:12.980> prefer<00:02:13.069> is<00:02:13.819> this<00:02:14.060> a<00:02:14.090> long<00:02:14.569> slow

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180

I<00:02:17.390> like<00:02:18.760> definitive<00:02:19.760> flavors<00:02:20.269> and<00:02:20.569> and<00:02:20.870> the

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
I like definitive flavors and and the

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:22.869 
I like definitive flavors and and the
cheese<00:02:21.319> sort<00:02:21.680> of<00:02:21.739> knowing<00:02:22.190> what<00:02:22.370> it<00:02:22.489> is

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
cheese sort of knowing what it is

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.839 
cheese sort of knowing what it is
meaning<00:02:23.319> if<00:02:24.319> it's<00:02:24.560> if<00:02:24.830> it's<00:02:25.040> a<00:02:25.160> stinky<00:02:25.670> wash

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
meaning if it's if it's a stinky wash

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.789 
meaning if it's if it's a stinky wash
rind<00:02:26.150> cheese<00:02:26.269> it<00:02:26.690> should<00:02:26.870> have<00:02:27.170> those<00:02:27.440> sort<00:02:27.769> of

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
rind cheese it should have those sort of

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.339 
rind cheese it should have those sort of
characteristics<00:02:28.760> but<00:02:29.599> it<00:02:29.720> shouldn't<00:02:30.080> leave

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
characteristics but it shouldn't leave

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.680 
characteristics but it shouldn't leave
you<00:02:30.560> kind<00:02:30.980> of<00:02:31.129> rolling<00:02:32.030> around<00:02:32.269> on<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:32.599> floor
