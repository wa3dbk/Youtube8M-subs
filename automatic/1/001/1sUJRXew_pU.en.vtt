00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.640
 for america chile how are you going to go in 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.640
 this period 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.430
 well the 10 of swords says that they 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.410
 they will save all the negative cycles 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.570
 that they have had and probably 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.210
 still missing combats that are super 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.640
 strong gives me the idea that they are going to 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.619
 close two super difficult situations 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.740
 because every day they are going to be very 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.530
 bad the situation more difficult each 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.330
 person who comes or each party that 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.879
 come it's going to be harder and it's going to be 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.059
 more bravo so every moment they go to 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.680
 have to take care of your backs rather 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.719
 they are probably going to be in a 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.360
 period where they will not be able to advance 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.309
 totally as they want in a part of the 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.469
 party towards the future because 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.170
 probably a rival comes to him who is 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.000
 very difficult and they will have to take care of themselves and 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.879
 keep calm to reach a 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.100
 balance I do not know at least all 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.619
 the parties without ciclables but there is a 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.899
 third that is very difficult channel that 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.180
 a tie can strike a balance 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:11.730
 and a defeat but 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.770
 with much difficulty he says that they go 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.770
 to be between the first and second place 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.440
 and they could probably stay in the 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.960
 second although the first one could be 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.700
 as in the hands probably they 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.010
 they have a very good star that goes to 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.960
 work very well in the game but 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.810
 that they are in the crowned letters 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.600
 as a second place probably at 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.550
 end of the road they should win 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.340
 but they are going to have to do a job 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.710
 superhuman because the letters come out 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.740
 that are now earning second place 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.229
 of all the competition and probably 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.030
 if you work in a little more they could win 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.430
 the first but it is not yet 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.190
 designated to achieve in the part of the 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.340
 universe because they still lack a 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.920
 personal order and gives the idea that there are two 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.890
 people who are going to be very sick in 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.890
 possible futures and that hurts a 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.850
 little the last part of this cup 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.530
 America 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.210
 you are probably going to have to work 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.370
 with pull upside down 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.680
 will not occupy some players in these 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.990
 two parties that come so that after 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.210
 they can occupy them because if they do 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.860
 backwards they are going to harm themselves 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.750
 it has to do with strategy without 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.830
 strategy they did backwards could 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.830
 win totally
