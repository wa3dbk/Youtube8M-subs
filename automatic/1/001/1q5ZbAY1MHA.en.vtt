00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.619 

alright<00:00:01.230> well<00:00:01.500> I<00:00:01.680> am<00:00:01.920> going<00:00:02.340> to<00:00:02.490> do<00:00:02.730> a<00:00:03.149> little

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
alright well I am going to do a little

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.390 
alright well I am going to do a little
experiment<00:00:04.440> here<00:00:04.560> with<00:00:05.160> this<00:00:06.500> new<00:00:07.500> filter

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
experiment here with this new filter

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.660 
experiment here with this new filter
unit<00:00:09.030> basically<00:00:09.630> it's<00:00:10.620> called<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:11.099> alka

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
unit basically it's called the alka

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:18.279 
unit basically it's called the alka
stream<00:00:12.420> and<00:00:13.580> basically<00:00:14.580> it<00:00:15.059> is<00:00:16.580> it<00:00:17.580> has

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
stream and basically it is it has

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.519 
stream and basically it is it has
filtration<00:00:19.289> in<00:00:19.500> it<00:00:19.710> it<00:00:20.010> has<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.250> little<00:00:20.609> bit<00:00:20.850> of

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
filtration in it it has a little bit of

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.380 
filtration in it it has a little bit of
ion-exchange<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.920> reduce<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.519> hardness<00:00:23.910> and

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
ion-exchange to reduce the hardness and

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.830 
ion-exchange to reduce the hardness and
it<00:00:25.050> adds<00:00:25.320> minerals<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.970> increase<00:00:27.599> the

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
it adds minerals to increase the

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.529 
it adds minerals to increase the
alkalinity<00:00:28.320> after<00:00:29.220> reducing<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:30.269> hardness

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
alkalinity after reducing the hardness

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.280 
alkalinity after reducing the hardness
and<00:00:32.210> so<00:00:33.210> it's<00:00:33.360> kind<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.870> interesting

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
and so it's kind of interesting

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.020 
and so it's kind of interesting
different<00:00:35.219> type<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.989> thing<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:38.250> has

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
different type of thing and it has

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.740 
different type of thing and it has
magnetic<00:00:39.719> ceramics<00:00:40.579> after<00:00:41.579> all<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:42.000> which

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
magnetic ceramics after all that which

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.500 
magnetic ceramics after all that which
then<00:00:43.050> ionized<00:00:43.710> lightly<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.520> what<00:00:45.270> I'm<00:00:45.360> going

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
then ionized lightly and what I'm going

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.389 
then ionized lightly and what I'm going
to<00:00:45.539> do<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.989> I'm<00:00:46.320> going<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.739> just<00:00:47.010> kind<00:00:47.309> of

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
to do is I'm going to just kind of

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.139 
to do is I'm going to just kind of
compare<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.350> ionized<00:00:49.350> water<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:50.579> comes<00:00:50.820> out

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
compare the ionized water that comes out

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.569 
compare the ionized water that comes out
of<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.420> alkyl<00:00:51.809> stream<00:00:52.140> with<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.070> ionized

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
of the alkyl stream with the ionized

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.840 
of the alkyl stream with the ionized
water<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:54.090> comes<00:00:54.270> out<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.780> melody<00:00:55.230> and

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
water that comes out of the melody and

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.430 
water that comes out of the melody and
will<00:00:56.850> test<00:00:57.090> my<00:00:57.180> first<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:58.020> then<00:00:58.109> I<00:00:58.170> want<00:00:58.289> to

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
will test my first and then I want to

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.840 
will test my first and then I want to
see<00:00:59.449> how<00:01:00.449> they<00:01:00.809> last<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.770> mean<00:01:02.039> does<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.460> alka

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
see how they last I mean does the alka

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.479 
see how they last I mean does the alka
stream<00:01:03.180> maybe<00:01:03.480> last<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:04.290> little<00:01:04.589> longer<00:01:04.710> than

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
stream maybe last a little longer than

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.070 
stream maybe last a little longer than
the<00:01:05.610> melody<00:01:06.200> is<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.650> viable<00:01:08.159> alternative

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
the melody is this a viable alternative

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.940 
the melody is this a viable alternative
for<00:01:10.080> somebody<00:01:10.590> who<00:01:12.080> otherwise<00:01:13.080> would<00:01:13.619> just<00:01:13.830> be

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
for somebody who otherwise would just be

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.070 
for somebody who otherwise would just be
borrow<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:15.299> know<00:01:15.500> buying<00:01:16.500> water<00:01:16.860> or<00:01:18.080> are

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
borrow a you know buying water or are

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.990 
borrow a you know buying water or are
they<00:01:19.320> they<00:01:19.590> couldn't<00:01:19.950> have<00:01:20.159> their<00:01:20.369> own<00:01:20.400> water

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
they they couldn't have their own water

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.030 
they they couldn't have their own water
ionizer<00:01:21.420> for<00:01:21.720> one<00:01:22.229> reason<00:01:22.439> or<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.799> other<00:01:22.950> and

ionizer for one reason or the other and

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.270 
ionizer for one reason or the other and
and<00:01:26.040> then<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.700> know<00:01:26.850> maybe<00:01:27.299> some<00:01:27.630> people<00:01:27.810> have

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
and then you know maybe some people have

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.910 
and then you know maybe some people have
such<00:01:29.280> hard<00:01:29.640> source<00:01:30.119> water<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:31.380> they<00:01:31.409> just

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
such hard source water that they just

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.690 
such hard source water that they just
cannot<00:01:33.320> use<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> regular<00:01:34.619> ionizer<00:01:35.189> without

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
cannot use a regular ionizer without

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.630 
cannot use a regular ionizer without
doing<00:01:36.060> all<00:01:36.150> kinds<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:36.869> reverse<00:01:37.740> osmosis<00:01:37.950> and

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
doing all kinds of reverse osmosis and

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.539 
doing all kinds of reverse osmosis and
whatnot<00:01:39.030> now<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.930> alka<00:01:40.439> stream<00:01:40.770> might<00:01:41.070> be<00:01:41.340> a

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
whatnot now the alka stream might be a

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.480 
whatnot now the alka stream might be a
good<00:01:42.030> viable<00:01:42.920> alternative<00:01:43.920> for<00:01:44.310> that

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
good viable alternative for that

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.810 
good viable alternative for that
scenario<00:01:45.140> so<00:01:46.140> I'm<00:01:46.200> just<00:01:46.439> here<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:46.920> test<00:01:47.430> this

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
scenario so I'm just here to test this

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.880 
scenario so I'm just here to test this
and<00:01:48.270> see<00:01:48.509> what<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:48.990> does<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:50.540> I'm<00:01:51.540> going<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.320> go

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
and see what it does and I'm going to go

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.490 
and see what it does and I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.100> get<00:01:53.310> water<00:01:53.759> started<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:55.040> it<00:01:57.500> and

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
ahead and get water started to it and

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.860 
ahead and get water started to it and
we'll<00:01:59.430> also

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
we'll also

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.400 
we'll also
I'm<00:02:01.710> not<00:02:01.950> going<00:02:02.220> to<00:02:02.310> necessarily<00:02:03.020> worry<00:02:04.020> about

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
I'm not going to necessarily worry about

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.350 
I'm not going to necessarily worry about
pouring<00:02:04.860> at<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.460> same<00:02:06.740> flow<00:02:07.740> rate<00:02:08.130> ER<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.550> all

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
pouring at the same flow rate ER and all

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.850 
pouring at the same flow rate ER and all
you<00:02:09.690> so<00:02:09.960> I<00:02:10.080> consider<00:02:11.040> a<00:02:11.130> similar<00:02:11.790> Chloe<00:02:12.860> I'll

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
you so I consider a similar Chloe I'll

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.560 
you so I consider a similar Chloe I'll
just<00:02:14.220> pour<00:02:14.670> from<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.000> melody<00:02:15.540> over<00:02:15.720> here<00:02:16.290> and

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
just pour from the melody over here and

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:24.530 
just pour from the melody over here and
mmm<00:02:20.120> wilfy<00:02:21.230> what<00:02:22.230> how<00:02:23.040> they<00:02:23.340> how<00:02:24.180> both<00:02:24.510> of

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
mmm wilfy what how they how both of

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.670 
mmm wilfy what how they how both of
these<00:02:24.870> are<00:02:25.880> now<00:02:26.880> the<00:02:27.360> alka<00:02:27.900> stream<00:02:28.380> is

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
these are now the alka stream is

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
these are now the alka stream is
actually<00:02:29.550> hooked<00:02:29.820> up<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.500> my<00:02:31.500> faucet<00:02:32.310> diverter

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
actually hooked up to my faucet diverter

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.570 
actually hooked up to my faucet diverter
right<00:02:33.060> now<00:02:33.330> and<00:02:34.070> I<00:02:35.750> I<00:02:36.750> can<00:02:37.560> turn<00:02:37.950> it<00:02:38.070> off<00:02:38.190> though

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
right now and I I can turn it off though

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.930 
right now and I I can turn it off though
with<00:02:38.850> this<00:02:39.000> button<00:02:39.480> on<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.810> top<00:02:40.080> and<00:02:40.580> that<00:02:41.580> is

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
with this button on the top and that is

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.260 
with this button on the top and that is
exactly<00:02:42.240> what<00:02:42.810> I<00:02:42.900> will<00:02:43.110> do<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:43.760> then<00:02:44.760> I'm

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
exactly what I will do and then I'm

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:59.600 
exactly what I will do and then I'm
going<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:46.460> test<00:02:47.460> it<00:02:49.400> and<00:02:56.990> let's<00:02:57.990> see<00:02:58.500> what<00:02:59.340> we

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
going to test it and let's see what we

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:07.130 
going to test it and let's see what we
get<00:03:02.150> it's<00:03:03.150> not<00:03:03.480> too<00:03:03.900> bad<00:03:04.140> really<00:03:04.640> for<00:03:05.640> a<00:03:06.140> non

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
get it's not too bad really for a non

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.699 
get it's not too bad really for a non
electric<00:03:07.590> water<00:03:08.220> ionizer<00:03:08.850> I'm<00:03:09.620> kind<00:03:10.620> of

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
electric water ionizer I'm kind of

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.720 
electric water ionizer I'm kind of
surprised<00:03:11.190> that<00:03:11.489> we're<00:03:11.790> getting<00:03:12.030> some<00:03:12.720> decent

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
surprised that we're getting some decent

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.120 
surprised that we're getting some decent
orp<00:03:14.730> it's<00:03:15.570> not<00:03:15.989> what<00:03:16.530> I'm<00:03:16.709> used<00:03:17.130> to<00:03:17.970> as<00:03:18.239> far<00:03:18.510> as

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
orp it's not what I'm used to as far as

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.090 
orp it's not what I'm used to as far as
you<00:03:20.130> know<00:03:20.280> my<00:03:20.489> own<00:03:20.670> drinking<00:03:21.209> water<00:03:21.480> so<00:03:21.930> so<00:03:22.890> I<00:03:22.920> I

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
you know my own drinking water so so I I

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.590 
you know my own drinking water so so I I
don't<00:03:23.580> prefer<00:03:24.150> it<00:03:24.360> myself<00:03:25.260> but<00:03:26.220> if<00:03:26.580> if<00:03:27.030> it<00:03:27.450> was

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
don't prefer it myself but if if it was

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.590 
don't prefer it myself but if if it was
a<00:03:27.630> scenario<00:03:28.440> where<00:03:28.500> you<00:03:29.130> know<00:03:29.910> somebody<00:03:30.209> just

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
a scenario where you know somebody just

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.440 
a scenario where you know somebody just
couldn't<00:03:32.780> you<00:03:33.780> know<00:03:33.810> they<00:03:34.230> I<00:03:35.130> have<00:03:36.120> seen

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
couldn't you know they I have seen

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.150 
couldn't you know they I have seen
people<00:03:36.480> in<00:03:37.820> living<00:03:38.820> in<00:03:38.880> apartment<00:03:39.660> and<00:03:40.260> their

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
people in living in apartment and their

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.729 
people in living in apartment and their
water<00:03:41.430> is<00:03:41.670> so<00:03:42.000> hard<00:03:42.420> and<00:03:43.020> they<00:03:43.110> really<00:03:43.500> need

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
water is so hard and they really need

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.400 
water is so hard and they really need
that<00:03:44.010> I'm<00:03:44.640> nature<00:03:45.150> they<00:03:46.019> would<00:03:46.200> need<00:03:46.380> a

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
that I'm nature they would need a

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.770 
that I'm nature they would need a
reverse<00:03:46.800> osmosis<00:03:47.180> remineralize<00:03:48.180> ER<00:03:48.209> in<00:03:48.510> order

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
reverse osmosis remineralize ER in order

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.530 
reverse osmosis remineralize ER in order
to<00:03:48.930> be<00:03:49.050> able<00:03:49.140> too<00:03:49.350> high<00:03:49.560> a<00:03:49.590> nice<00:03:49.950> and<00:03:50.370> i<00:03:51.269> have

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
to be able too high a nice and i have

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.320 
to be able too high a nice and i have
seen<00:03:51.930> that<00:03:52.680> person<00:03:53.190> then<00:03:53.370> just<00:03:53.730> you<00:03:54.150> know<00:03:54.300> not

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
seen that person then just you know not

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.490 
seen that person then just you know not
be<00:03:54.870> able<00:03:54.930> to<00:03:55.110> get<00:03:55.230> an<00:03:55.350> ionizer<00:03:57.110> simply<00:03:58.110> because

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
be able to get an ionizer simply because

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.570 
be able to get an ionizer simply because
they<00:03:59.150> they<00:04:00.150> just<00:04:00.390> did<00:04:01.170> not<00:04:01.320> have<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.920> facility

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
they they just did not have the facility

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.030 
they they just did not have the facility
to<00:04:02.780> in<00:04:03.780> an<00:04:03.930> apartment<00:04:04.320> you<00:04:04.590> can't<00:04:04.830> just

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
to in an apartment you can't just

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.530 
to in an apartment you can't just
install<00:04:05.250> an<00:04:05.730> hour

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
install an hour

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.979 
install an hour
would<00:04:06.750> be<00:04:06.900> unrealistic<00:04:08.090> all<00:04:09.090> right<00:04:09.329> well<00:04:09.719> I

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
would be unrealistic all right well I

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.280 
would be unrealistic all right well I
and<00:04:10.620> you<00:04:11.129> know<00:04:11.480> there<00:04:12.480> there's<00:04:13.019> other

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
and you know there there's other

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.069 
and you know there there's other
scenarios<00:04:14.010> like<00:04:14.370> let's<00:04:15.120> say<00:04:15.239> a<00:04:15.359> college

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
scenarios like let's say a college

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.819 
scenarios like let's say a college
student<00:04:16.620> in<00:04:16.709> a<00:04:16.829> dorm<00:04:17.130> room<00:04:17.519> or<00:04:18.500> you<00:04:19.500> know<00:04:19.620> all

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
student in a dorm room or you know all

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.700 
student in a dorm room or you know all
kinds<00:04:20.100> of<00:04:20.400> reasons<00:04:21.090> why<00:04:21.690> you<00:04:22.289> couldn't

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
kinds of reasons why you couldn't

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.650 
kinds of reasons why you couldn't
install<00:04:23.280> a<00:04:23.570> regular<00:04:24.570> electric<00:04:25.289> ionizer<00:04:26.660> maybe

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
install a regular electric ionizer maybe

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.730 
install a regular electric ionizer maybe
your<00:04:27.900> water<00:04:28.139> source<00:04:28.560> doesn't<00:04:28.949> have<00:04:29.220> electric

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
your water source doesn't have electric

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.060 
your water source doesn't have electric
that's<00:04:31.740> a<00:04:31.949> possible<00:04:32.520> thing<00:04:32.850> so<00:04:33.660> this<00:04:34.620> is<00:04:34.650> not

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
that's a possible thing so this is not

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.640 
that's a possible thing so this is not
require<00:04:35.580> electricity<00:04:35.880> and<00:04:36.690> yet<00:04:36.900> it<00:04:37.229> still

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
require electricity and yet it still

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.029 
require electricity and yet it still
just<00:04:37.710> get<00:04:38.100> a<00:04:38.130> good<00:04:38.370> ionization<00:04:38.820> or<00:04:40.039> somewhat

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 
just get a good ionization or somewhat

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:44.240 
just get a good ionization or somewhat
I'll<00:04:41.370> say<00:04:41.610> fair<00:04:41.910> or<00:04:42.240> well<00:04:43.020> it's<00:04:43.620> probably<00:04:44.099> the

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
I'll say fair or well it's probably the

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.540 
I'll say fair or well it's probably the
equivalent<00:04:44.310> of<00:04:44.820> maybe<00:04:45.090> a<00:04:45.180> level<00:04:46.139> two<00:04:46.440> of<00:04:46.800> the

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
equivalent of maybe a level two of the

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.320 
equivalent of maybe a level two of the
ionized<00:04:48.360> water<00:04:48.500> so<00:04:49.500> here<00:04:49.680> we've<00:04:49.830> got<00:04:49.889> a<00:04:50.009> 9.4<00:04:50.880> pH

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
ionized water so here we've got a 9.4 pH

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.520 
ionized water so here we've got a 9.4 pH
and<00:04:51.750> a<00:04:52.500> negative<00:04:53.150> 234<00:04:54.150> is<00:04:54.419> our<00:04:54.630> starting<00:04:55.199> point

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
and a negative 234 is our starting point

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.810 
and a negative 234 is our starting point
with<00:04:56.460> the<00:04:56.729> Alpha<00:04:57.210> stream<00:04:57.690> and<00:04:58.190> so<00:04:59.190> I'm<00:04:59.580> going

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
with the Alpha stream and so I'm going

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:06.820 
with the Alpha stream and so I'm going
to<00:04:59.849> go<00:05:00.030> ahead<00:05:00.150> and<00:05:00.740> put<00:05:01.740> the<00:05:01.889> lid<00:05:02.130> on<00:05:02.599> that<00:05:05.240> and

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
to go ahead and put the lid on that and

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:16.040 
to go ahead and put the lid on that and
then<00:05:08.150> with<00:05:09.150> the<00:05:10.310> melody<00:05:11.310> I<00:05:14.000> kind<00:05:15.000> of<00:05:15.120> have<00:05:15.750> this

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
then with the melody I kind of have this

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.110 
then with the melody I kind of have this
excuse<00:05:16.979> me<00:05:17.159> I've<00:05:17.280> got<00:05:17.610> to<00:05:17.729> have<00:05:17.849> it<00:05:17.880> over

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
excuse me I've got to have it over

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:27.010 
excuse me I've got to have it over
filled<00:05:18.659> a<00:05:18.960> little<00:05:19.229> bit<00:05:19.409> and<00:05:20.539> made<00:05:21.539> a<00:05:21.570> mess<00:05:22.849> but

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:37.129 

you<00:05:28.020> know<00:05:28.250> the<00:05:29.690> melody<00:05:30.690> is<00:05:32.750> in<00:05:33.750> my<00:05:34.669> eyes<00:05:35.669> just<00:05:36.539> a

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:37.139 
you know the melody is in my eyes just a

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:42.320 
you know the melody is in my eyes just a
lot<00:05:37.620> easier<00:05:37.889> to<00:05:38.550> use<00:05:40.099> possibly<00:05:41.099> cheaper<00:05:41.909> in

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
lot easier to use possibly cheaper in

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.560 
lot easier to use possibly cheaper in
the<00:05:42.360> long<00:05:42.479> run<00:05:42.750> because<00:05:43.500> the<00:05:43.740> alka<00:05:44.250> stream<00:05:44.789> um

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:47.570 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:52.219 

believe<00:05:48.570> it<00:05:48.690> or<00:05:48.780> not<00:05:48.930> you<00:05:49.349> cuss<00:05:49.949> like<00:05:51.229> 300

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:52.229 
believe it or not you cuss like 300

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:57.770 
believe it or not you cuss like 300
bucks<00:05:52.260> something<00:05:52.949> like<00:05:53.039> that<00:05:53.340> and<00:05:55.370> it<00:05:56.780> that

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
bucks something like that and it that

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.100 
bucks something like that and it that
filter<00:05:58.590> I'm<00:05:58.860> not<00:05:59.130> I<00:05:59.400> think<00:06:00.210> it<00:06:00.389> might<00:06:00.539> last<00:06:00.810> a

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
filter I'm not I think it might last a

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.960 
filter I'm not I think it might last a
year<00:06:01.139> but<00:06:02.360> the<00:06:03.949> practically<00:06:04.949> all<00:06:05.190> of<00:06:05.220> it<00:06:05.789> is

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970 
year but the practically all of it is

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.749 
year but the practically all of it is
the<00:06:06.389> filter<00:06:06.810> I'll<00:06:07.620> have<00:06:07.889> to<00:06:08.039> find<00:06:08.280> out<00:06:08.490> what

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:08.759 
the filter I'll have to find out what

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:13.129 
the filter I'll have to find out what
that<00:06:09.210> costs<00:06:09.840> to<00:06:10.020> replace<00:06:10.729> because<00:06:11.870> that's<00:06:12.870> got

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:13.139 
that costs to replace because that's got

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:15.529 
that costs to replace because that's got
to<00:06:13.289> be<00:06:13.380> fairly<00:06:13.800> expensive<00:06:14.460> to<00:06:15.150> replace<00:06:15.419> that

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:15.539 
to be fairly expensive to replace that

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:16.580 
to be fairly expensive to replace that
filter

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.590 
filter

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.570 
filter
that's<00:06:16.880> pretty<00:06:17.880> much<00:06:18.120> all<00:06:18.420> there<00:06:18.840> is<00:06:18.900> to<00:06:19.440> that

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
that's pretty much all there is to that

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.150 
that's pretty much all there is to that
it's<00:06:20.580> a<00:06:20.760> filter<00:06:21.120> housing<00:06:21.720> with<00:06:22.590> a<00:06:22.620> few<00:06:23.010> little

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:23.160 
it's a filter housing with a few little

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.630 
it's a filter housing with a few little
connectors<00:06:24.090> and<00:06:24.570> that's<00:06:25.380> it<00:06:25.710> and<00:06:26.010> the<00:06:26.190> filter

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:26.640 
connectors and that's it and the filter

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.300 
connectors and that's it and the filter
media<00:06:26.880> and<00:06:27.300> in<00:06:27.630> it<00:06:27.810> is<00:06:28.050> the<00:06:28.260> majority<00:06:29.070> of<00:06:29.100> what

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310 
media and in it is the majority of what

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.920 
media and in it is the majority of what
it<00:06:29.460> is<00:06:30.650> all<00:06:31.650> right<00:06:32.070> well<00:06:32.640> let<00:06:33.300> me<00:06:33.330> see<00:06:33.690> we've

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:33.930 
it is all right well let me see we've

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:39.770 
it is all right well let me see we've
got<00:06:33.960> a<00:06:34.700> 9.7<00:06:35.700> pH<00:06:36.120> in<00:06:36.600> a<00:06:36.900> negative<00:06:37.670> 519<00:06:38.670> so<00:06:39.600> that's

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:39.780 
got a 9.7 pH in a negative 519 so that's

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.690 
got a 9.7 pH in a negative 519 so that's
what<00:06:39.990> we're<00:06:40.140> starting<00:06:40.560> out<00:06:40.710> with<00:06:40.980> with<00:06:41.520> the

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:41.700 
what we're starting out with with the

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:46.640 
what we're starting out with with the
melody<00:06:42.180> and<00:06:42.950> so<00:06:43.950> we'll<00:06:44.190> we'll<00:06:44.730> see<00:06:45.590> i'm<00:06:46.590> going

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:46.650 
melody and so we'll we'll see i'm going

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:54.710 
melody and so we'll we'll see i'm going
to<00:06:47.090> give<00:06:48.090> you<00:06:48.420> a<00:06:49.010> timestamp<00:06:50.010> for<00:06:50.370> this<00:06:53.720> tested

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 
to give you a timestamp for this tested

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.830 
to give you a timestamp for this tested
at<00:06:54.930> eight<00:06:55.490> fifty<00:06:56.490> seven<00:06:57.300> pm<00:06:57.840> and<00:06:58.230> that<00:06:58.670> is

00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 
at eight fifty seven pm and that is

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:05.710 
at eight fifty seven pm and that is
november<00:07:00.840> 18<00:07:01.970> 2010<00:07:02.970> and<00:07:03.420> so<00:07:04.260> i'm<00:07:04.680> going<00:07:05.190> to

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:05.720 
november 18 2010 and so i'm going to

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:10.120 
november 18 2010 and so i'm going to
test<00:07:06.720> these<00:07:07.110> at<00:07:07.980> regular<00:07:08.760> intervals<00:07:09.450> and

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:10.130 
test these at regular intervals and

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:13.460 
test these at regular intervals and
hopefully<00:07:11.130> we'll<00:07:12.000> see<00:07:12.300> if<00:07:12.630> there's<00:07:12.960> any<00:07:13.230> kind

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:13.470 
hopefully we'll see if there's any kind

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:17.030 
hopefully we'll see if there's any kind
of<00:07:13.620> a<00:07:13.740> pattern<00:07:14.310> here<00:07:14.850> whether<00:07:15.350> the<00:07:16.350> alka

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:17.040 
of a pattern here whether the alka

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.500 
of a pattern here whether the alka
stream<00:07:17.580> holds<00:07:18.360> its<00:07:18.510> ionization<00:07:18.990> better<00:07:19.740> or

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:20.510 
stream holds its ionization better or

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:23.900 
stream holds its ionization better or
does<00:07:21.510> the<00:07:22.010> melody<00:07:23.010> hold<00:07:23.310> its<00:07:23.550> ionization

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:23.910 
does the melody hold its ionization

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:26.630 
does the melody hold its ionization
better<00:07:24.450> or<00:07:24.780> are<00:07:25.050> they<00:07:25.860> the<00:07:26.040> same<00:07:26.250> as<00:07:26.490> each

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:26.640 
better or are they the same as each

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.810 
better or are they the same as each
other<00:07:27.590> I'm<00:07:28.590> just<00:07:28.890> going<00:07:29.100> to<00:07:29.160> guess<00:07:29.460> they're

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:29.820 
other I'm just going to guess they're

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.780 
other I'm just going to guess they're
probably<00:07:30.240> going<00:07:30.810> to<00:07:30.900> be<00:07:30.990> this<00:07:31.110> you<00:07:31.620> know<00:07:31.790> drop

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:32.790 
probably going to be this you know drop

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:37.030 
probably going to be this you know drop
they'll<00:07:33.510> both<00:07:33.810> drop<00:07:34.290> at<00:07:34.650> a<00:07:35.190> fairly<00:07:36.060> similar

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:37.040 
they'll both drop at a fairly similar

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:41.660 
they'll both drop at a fairly similar
pace<00:07:38.040> but<00:07:38.520> now<00:07:39.180> we'll<00:07:39.450> see<00:07:39.780> it<00:07:40.020> all<00:07:40.670> smells

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:41.670 
pace but now we'll see it all smells

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:46.220 
pace but now we'll see it all smells
interesting<00:07:42.980> to<00:07:43.980> me<00:07:44.160> alright<00:07:45.090> well<00:07:45.510> check

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:46.230 
interesting to me alright well check

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:48.500 
interesting to me alright well check
back<00:07:46.470> later
