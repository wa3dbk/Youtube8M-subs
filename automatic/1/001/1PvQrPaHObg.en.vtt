about<00:01:24.180> this<00:01:24.420> big<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.900> this<00:01:24.990> deep<00:01:25.290> because<00:01:26.420> the

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
about this big and this deep because the

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.819

hole<00:01:29.070> down<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.579> bottom<00:01:29.880> because<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.180> didn't

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
hole down to the bottom because I didn't

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.030 
hole down to the bottom because I didn't
know<00:01:30.570> how<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.720> pinpoint<00:01:30.990> but<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:31.710> was<00:01:31.890> so

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
know how to pinpoint but I was so

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.249

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
have a ball at it but this is

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.580 
have a ball at it but this is
predominantly<00:03:03.400> a<00:03:04.000> hobby<00:03:04.270> for<00:03:04.510> men<00:03:04.720> I<00:03:04.959> don't

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
predominantly a hobby for men I don't

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.080 
predominantly a hobby for men I don't
know<00:03:05.739> why<00:03:05.950> more<00:03:06.160> women<00:03:06.310> don't<00:03:06.670> get<00:03:06.819> involved

know why more women don't get involved
in<00:03:07.300> this<00:03:07.480> I<00:03:07.750> think<00:03:07.989> a<00:03:08.350> lot<00:03:08.530> of<00:03:08.560> it<00:03:08.739> has<00:03:08.890> to<00:03:09.010> do

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
in this I think a lot of it has to do

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.400 
in this I think a lot of it has to do
with<00:03:09.220> not<00:03:09.370> wanting<00:03:09.520> to<00:03:09.730> get<00:03:09.850> dirty<00:03:10.120> it's<00:03:10.870> the

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
with not wanting to get dirty it's the

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.840 
with not wanting to get dirty it's the

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
women that get involved in this are the

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.820 
women that get involved in this are the
type<00:03:13.030> that<00:03:13.209> are<00:03:13.330> more<00:03:13.510> outdoors<00:03:14.110> related<00:03:14.680> more

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.820 
related than indoors I have quite a few
meteorites<00:03:22.000> that<00:03:22.209> I<00:03:22.239> found<00:03:22.570> in<00:03:22.840> gold<00:03:23.440> Basin

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
meteorites that I found in gold Basin

meteorites that I found in gold Basin
it's<00:03:24.519> a<00:03:24.670> fairly<00:03:25.030> well<00:03:25.330> known<00:03:25.360> meteor<00:03:25.930> right

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
it's a fairly well known meteor right

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.949 
it's a fairly well known meteor right
field<00:03:27.220> that's<00:03:27.730> a<00:03:27.970> couple<00:03:28.239> of<00:03:28.390> hours<00:03:28.720> drive

field that's a couple of hours drive
from<00:03:28.989> here<00:03:29.200> so<00:03:29.830> it's<00:03:29.980> easy<00:03:30.130> for<00:03:30.370> me<00:03:30.459> to<00:03:30.489> get<00:03:30.730> to
