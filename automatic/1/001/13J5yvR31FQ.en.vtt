 davos people here is the spanier and 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.219
 no need to worry has dense in 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.160
 channel honored we are still with 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.940
 whole and olli of riedels tv and the 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.010
 reason why we today such a 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.050
 Unprofessional voice hears that is there 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.000
 quite one wanted me to be the Spaniard hd 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.080
 talk to you a little bit and 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.670
 if we already have a problem 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.380
 because the entertainment level that 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.029
 controlling every day on this channel 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.679
 by far exceeds mine 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.480
 I have options for that 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.160
 thought we talk about this one today 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.540
 this is a serious topic and that 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.579
 to stimulate thought 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.899
 When I say we mean I too 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.000
 we and that means is in the 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.680
 comments your opinion to say and 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.829
 Of course it is best if you have one 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.020
 video answer this costs yes and today 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.250
 it's about values â€‹â€‹it thought the separation 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.010
 of the two van der vaart sylvie and 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.570
 Of course I did not want Raphael today 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.949
 talk about the youtube a bit 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.199
 development the youtube the last 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.930
 has done weeks and days and what 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.480
 I do not like it yes and on 14 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.060
 february 2005 it started with this 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.490
 wonderful video portal fun was that 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.500
 motto fun shares on the share of videos 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.750
 of ideas and shares of illegal 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.909
 uploaded music youtube was not 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.040
 employment at least even more 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.810
 time contract youtube that was as the 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.009
 do not watch any advertising breaks no 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.960
 Asked skits 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.060
 instead, fails distributed harry potter 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.380
 parodies and monkey smokes videos and here 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.979
 is likely to be program itself 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.650
 choose 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.560
 in contrast to television yes how much 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.210
 is it was still 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.770
 well, at least youtube is still called 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.170
 youtube but much more is not 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.450
 stayed or I mean that alone 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.340
 Everyone wants to become a partner now 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.649
 the 30 seconds advertising I have absolutely 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.320
 but nothing against the reactions 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.090
 Everybody wants to raise this money 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.130
 only videos produce clicks 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.600
 possible increase 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.680
 quantity instead of quality mass instead 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.900
 class 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.820
 is not the advertising that's what we are 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.100
 most disturbs the normal television 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.530
 oh no, there are still the videos 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.180
 you have to watch the program in that 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.070
 normal television of the normal channels 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.390
 and I wonder how long that will stay 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.290
 on youtube still leaving the video 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.610
 choose yourself 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.380
 I get it every day now 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.700
 Thousands of recommendations which video is 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.140
 I should have a look 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.700
 I've already had it three times 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.290
 looked at and over and over again that stands in the 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.640
 video suggestions similar to the one in 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.660
 Watch the whole series 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.090
 repeat again and again 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.220
 and yes, where does innovation stay? 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.290
 youtube instead of stepping forward 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.520
 We go back a step 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.110
 We're going back to TV 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.330
 go back to patronizing in 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.820
 Direction advertising breaks in direction 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.830
 misbehavior and mass production and 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.510
 why the whole fuck with it someday 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.370
 according to a seat leon audi a6 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.870
 can afford any kindes 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.340
 can say yes I have today 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.459
 again earned two euros with youtube 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.800
 fully horny and so no I want and 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.900
 can not accuse any youtuber he 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.340
 his money because i just want to 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.470
 that the great commentators and 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.360
 youtuber talk with their subscribers 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.060
 the ones who made you big and the 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.170
 to whom they owe everything 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.610
 best would be if the 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.830
 commentators also do not tell which 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.080
 have looked at porn or which 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.489
 pizzas they like to eat but over 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.230
 youtube about the changes you make 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.790
 on youtube still can because 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.989
 if someone something better 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.970
 can turn back then it is the 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.910
 commentators at the employers now 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.260
 so to speak, youtube and i find it 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.239
 should talk to those who they tall 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.739
 even if they did then 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.750
 At least the same decision is made 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.690
 they should be with a few of us 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.220
 keep agreement 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.710
 those were my thoughts on this 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.660
 friday i hope you liked it 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.430
 and a little thought 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.930
 and if you have an idea right now 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.010
 any opinion then writes 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.630
 you best in the comments 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.720
 or even better like the answer 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:42.720
 So everything would be perfect then continue 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.310
 I still say that in the idea and 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.070
 say that hit in this video 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.410
 it is by no means that of rhi 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.340
 comply with stevie and in this 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.020
 I wish you one more 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.130
 wonderful week a nice day i 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.130
 I'm out of my skin
