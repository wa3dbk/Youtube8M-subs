00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:27.550
 Well, girls, I put the handles in a 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:27.550
 in a saucepan I'm going to add the sugar 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.180
 r 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.180
 the lemon juice 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:46.540
 and it seems that they left me 12 miles 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.540
 now I'm going to take them out and the teaspoon 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.140
 this 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.470
 this is put on medium heat and then with 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.240
 a blender of these so hands 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:05.720
 let's liquefy a little bit 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:08.510
 undo the mangoes as you see I left them 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.450
 It does bits if they do not have anything 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.600
 wrong and with the normal blender but very 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.890
 little good girls here I already read it 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.830
 account 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.659
 and it has the consistency that I want 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.610
 that remain as well as that bits of 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:26.010
 mango as you see 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.750
 and as I said we're going to have it on fire 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.340
 we're going to be stirring 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.120
 constantly so that it does not go to 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.390
 hit on the eyebrow and we will be like this 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:39.840
 for 10 minutes and past 10 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.480
 minutes we put out the fire we put in a 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.540
 glass jar 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.820
 with a pomegranate cap more than they're going to 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.330
 cover until it is cold as it is 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.710
 very cold they will put it in the fridge and 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.070
 the next day you can use it 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.390
 since today or like me right now I am 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.270
 doing at night then already for 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:04.500
 tomorrow will be ready good girls 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:08.610
 here the 10 minutes have passed 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:12.330
 I just put out the fire and as you see 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.310
 change of color as I say you if 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.660
 they want they can liquefy it more to me 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:21.200
 like it so it's rustic this way the 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.280
 parasites 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.280
 see the consistency 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.280
 6a 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.020
 And now I'm going to empty the bottle 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.490
 that is as I say we have to wait for 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.930
 cool 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.930
 before refrigerating 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:42.760
 good girls I already the mafia in this 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:47.540
 jar as they see was also jam 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:50.530
 they look like they 're still hot 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.989
 how do you see this works account of 900 grams 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:57.109
 and it's almost arrived I do not know that this is 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:03:00.739
 approximately what will come out and 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:02.719
 As you can see easily takes you time 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.080
 towards here only a lot of half an hour in 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:07.950
 make them 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.700
 I'm serious, I hope there's 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.590

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:17.330

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.530

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:23.160
