00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
it's for you can strip wire with it well

it's for you can strip wire with it well
I've<00:00:59.160> got<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.399> bunch<00:00:59.699> of<00:01:00.120> Audion<00:01:00.960> wire<00:01:01.320> here

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
I've got a bunch of Audion wire here

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:08.500 
I've got a bunch of Audion wire here
this<00:01:04.019> here<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:05.129> some<00:01:05.519> 12-gauge<00:01:06.650> thh<00:01:07.650> n<00:01:07.950> wire

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
this here is some 12-gauge thh n wire

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.149 
this here is some 12-gauge thh n wire
now<00:01:09.510> had<00:01:09.780> nicked<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.530> hadn't<00:01:10.710> done<00:01:10.860> anything

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
now had nicked it I hadn't done anything

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.399 
now had nicked it I hadn't done anything
to<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:13.010> I'm<00:01:14.010> gonna<00:01:14.159> see<00:01:14.720> if<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.930> can't<00:01:16.229> get

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
to it and I'm gonna see if I can't get

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.490 
to it and I'm gonna see if I can't get
this<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:17.000> strip<00:01:18.000> it

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:28.030 

which<00:01:21.500> normally<00:01:24.430> it's<00:01:25.430> pretty<00:01:25.820> hard<00:01:26.060> to<00:01:27.040> strip

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
which normally it's pretty hard to strip

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.880 
which normally it's pretty hard to strip
anyway<00:01:29.860> and<00:01:30.880> it's<00:01:31.880> not<00:01:32.150> not<00:01:32.930> doing<00:01:33.229> too<00:01:33.440> Swift

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
anyway and it's not not doing too Swift

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:43.660 
anyway and it's not not doing too Swift
so<00:01:35.410> let<00:01:36.410> me<00:01:36.680> find<00:01:38.920> the<00:01:39.920> small<00:01:40.280> blade<00:01:41.290> and<00:01:42.670> what

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
so let me find the small blade and what

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:51.120 
so let me find the small blade and what
I'll<00:01:43.820> do<00:01:44.030> is<00:01:44.060> I'll<00:01:44.420> take<00:01:46.720> and<00:01:48.130> just<00:01:49.130> Nick<00:01:49.520> it

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
I'll do is I'll take and just Nick it

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.850 
I'll do is I'll take and just Nick it
and<00:01:52.130> I'm<00:01:52.820> not<00:01:53.240> going<00:01:53.570> deep<00:01:54.820> just<00:01:55.820> enough<00:01:56.450> to

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
and I'm not going deep just enough to

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:05.430 
and I'm not going deep just enough to
break<00:01:57.860> that<00:01:58.070> outer<00:01:58.340> jacket<00:02:02.229> and<00:02:03.229> there<00:02:04.070> it<00:02:04.190> is

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
break that outer jacket and there it is

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.370 
break that outer jacket and there it is
you<00:02:06.440> can<00:02:06.470> see<00:02:06.800> that<00:02:06.830> that<00:02:07.899> ended<00:02:08.899> up<00:02:09.019> stripping

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
you can see that that ended up stripping

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.210 
you can see that that ended up stripping
it<00:02:09.619> off<00:02:11.019> some<00:02:12.019> gauges<00:02:12.470> are<00:02:12.620> harder<00:02:12.980> than

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
it off some gauges are harder than

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.310 
it off some gauges are harder than
others<00:02:15.670> this<00:02:16.670> right<00:02:17.060> here<00:02:17.330> some<00:02:17.600> really<00:02:18.050> small

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
this is telephone wire this is like 22

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:33.569 
this is telephone wire this is like 22
gauge<00:02:23.860> wire<00:02:24.860> and<00:02:28.690> oh<00:02:30.610> that's<00:02:31.610> stranded<00:02:32.150> too

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:33.579 
gauge wire and oh that's stranded too

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:39.039 
gauge wire and oh that's stranded too
but<00:02:34.579> there's<00:02:34.880> a<00:02:35.560> there'd<00:02:36.560> is<00:02:36.860> it<00:02:37.660> hid<00:02:38.660> strip

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
but there's a there'd is it hid strip

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:47.920 
but there's a there'd is it hid strip
that<00:02:39.260> off<00:02:40.570> now<00:02:44.019> here<00:02:45.019> is<00:02:45.440> some<00:02:45.829> like<00:02:46.510> Wow

that off now here is some like Wow
but<00:02:48.170> 18<00:02:48.560> gauge<00:02:48.829> something<00:02:49.340> like<00:02:49.489> that<00:02:49.730> solid

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
but 18 gauge something like that solid

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.100 
but 18 gauge something like that solid
wire<00:02:51.190> and<00:02:52.190> I'm<00:02:52.519> just<00:02:52.760> taking<00:02:53.120> a<00:02:53.239> push<00:02:53.720> it<00:02:53.930> down

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
wire and I'm just taking a push it down

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.550 
wire and I'm just taking a push it down
in<00:02:54.320> there<00:02:55.510> then<00:02:56.510> I<00:02:56.780> pull<00:02:57.019> it

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.610 

and<00:03:00.490> if<00:03:00.640> you<00:03:00.760> do<00:03:00.940> it<00:03:01.090> on<00:03:01.209> one<00:03:01.390> side<00:03:01.690> and<00:03:02.050> it

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
and if you do it on one side and it

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.260 
and if you do it on one side and it
doesn't<00:03:02.950> work<00:03:03.069> flip<00:03:03.640> it<00:03:03.760> around<00:03:05.910> do<00:03:06.910> it<00:03:07.030> on<00:03:07.120> the

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
doesn't work flip it around do it on the

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.690 
doesn't work flip it around do it on the
other<00:03:07.300> side<00:03:09.000> okay<00:03:10.000> it's<00:03:10.390> starting<00:03:10.810> to<00:03:10.870> come

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
other side okay it's starting to come

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:18.840 
other side okay it's starting to come
and<00:03:12.870> a<00:03:13.870> hold<00:03:14.310> at<00:03:15.310> an<00:03:15.880> angle<00:03:16.300> and<00:03:17.100> pull<00:03:18.100> against

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
and a hold at an angle and pull against

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:25.650 
and a hold at an angle and pull against
it<00:03:19.000> and<00:03:19.209> there<00:03:19.750> you<00:03:19.780> go<00:03:23.459> that<00:03:24.459> stripped<00:03:24.940> it<00:03:25.120> now

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
it and there you go that stripped it now

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.180 
it and there you go that stripped it now
these<00:03:25.870> aren't<00:03:26.110> the<00:03:26.260> best<00:03:26.470> strippers<00:03:26.950> in<00:03:27.100> the

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
these aren't the best strippers in the

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:33.660 
these aren't the best strippers in the
world<00:03:27.870> but<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:29.920> new<00:03:30.130> work<00:03:31.050> now<00:03:32.050> this<00:03:32.530> is<00:03:32.980> like

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
world but the new work now this is like

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.560 
world but the new work now this is like
some<00:03:35.100> this<00:03:36.100> is<00:03:36.370> smaller<00:03:36.700> than<00:03:36.910> 18<00:03:37.269> this<00:03:37.450> is

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
some this is smaller than 18 this is

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.270 
some this is smaller than 18 this is
probably<00:03:37.840> 20<00:03:38.230> gauge<00:03:38.440> stranded<00:03:39.180> right<00:03:40.180> here

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
probably 20 gauge stranded right here

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.770 
probably 20 gauge stranded right here
I'll<00:03:42.280> just<00:03:42.519> take<00:03:42.760> it<00:03:43.530> put<00:03:44.530> it<00:03:44.680> in<00:03:44.830> there<00:03:45.069> and

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
I'll just take it put it in there and

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:52.830 
I'll just take it put it in there and
voila<00:03:47.400> there<00:03:48.400> it<00:03:48.550> is<00:03:49.110> it's<00:03:50.110> stripped<00:03:51.660> so<00:03:52.660> they

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
voila there it is it's stripped so they

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.830 
voila there it is it's stripped so they
do<00:03:52.900> work<00:03:53.260> you<00:03:53.970> just<00:03:54.970> got<00:03:55.180> to

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
do work you just got to

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.550 
do work you just got to
I<00:03:55.870> guess<00:03:56.830> being<00:03:57.100> an<00:03:57.220> electrician<00:03:58.260> I've<00:03:59.260> got

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
I guess being an electrician I've got

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.370 
I guess being an electrician I've got
the<00:03:59.680> know-how<00:04:00.130> and<00:04:00.660> I<00:04:01.660> can<00:04:01.840> make<00:04:02.050> them<00:04:02.200> work

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
the know-how and I can make them work

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.250 
the know-how and I can make them work
but<00:04:03.280> it<00:04:03.670> helps<00:04:04.150> if<00:04:04.299> you<00:04:04.480> take<00:04:04.750> and<00:04:04.959> put<00:04:05.140> the

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
but it helps if you take and put the

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.340 
but it helps if you take and put the
wire<00:04:05.470> in<00:04:05.799> and<00:04:06.540> shove<00:04:07.540> it<00:04:07.690> down<00:04:07.720> into<00:04:08.200> this

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
wire in and shove it down into this

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.310 
wire in and shove it down into this
groove<00:04:08.739> and<00:04:09.190> put<00:04:09.489> it<00:04:09.640> at<00:04:09.760> a<00:04:09.850> right<00:04:10.060> angle

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
groove and put it at a right angle

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.850 
groove and put it at a right angle
pulling<00:04:11.320> against<00:04:11.739> it<00:04:11.890> so<00:04:12.850> that<00:04:13.060> it'll<00:04:13.799> kind<00:04:14.799> of

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
pulling against it so that it'll kind of

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.890 
pulling against it so that it'll kind of
like<00:04:15.010> cut<00:04:15.340> the<00:04:15.370> insulation<00:04:15.820> is<00:04:16.329> it's<00:04:16.539> pulling

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
like cut the insulation is it's pulling

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.920 
like cut the insulation is it's pulling
it<00:04:17.019> off<00:04:17.669> but<00:04:18.669> it<00:04:18.789> can<00:04:19.000> be<00:04:19.239> done<00:04:19.479> as<00:04:20.440> you<00:04:21.370> see<00:04:21.930> the

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
it off but it can be done as you see the

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.730 
it off but it can be done as you see the
12<00:04:23.289> gauge<00:04:23.880> that<00:04:24.880> was<00:04:25.090> the<00:04:25.270> hardest<00:04:25.740> that's

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
12 gauge that was the hardest that's

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.590 
12 gauge that was the hardest that's
usually<00:04:27.250> always<00:04:27.430> pretty<00:04:27.880> hard<00:04:28.120> anyway

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
usually always pretty hard anyway

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.310 
usually always pretty hard anyway
especially<00:04:29.700> this<00:04:30.700> particular<00:04:30.910> outer<00:04:31.570> jacket

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
especially this particular outer jacket

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.230 
especially this particular outer jacket
this<00:04:32.590> is<00:04:32.880> th<00:04:33.880> HN<00:04:34.419> wire<00:04:34.690> and<00:04:35.190> this<00:04:36.190> is<00:04:36.370> oil<00:04:36.789> and

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
this is th HN wire and this is oil and

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.430 
this is th HN wire and this is oil and
gasoline<00:04:37.800> and<00:04:38.800> a<00:04:39.430> lot<00:04:39.669> of<00:04:39.880> other<00:04:40.440> chemicals

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
gasoline and a lot of other chemicals

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.100 
gasoline and a lot of other chemicals
this<00:04:42.100> is<00:04:42.310> real<00:04:42.520> resistant<00:04:43.240> to<00:04:43.390> that<00:04:43.570> so<00:04:43.960> this

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
this is real resistant to that so this

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.420 
this is real resistant to that so this
is<00:04:44.169> a<00:04:44.350> really<00:04:44.800> tough<00:04:45.039> outer<00:04:45.310> jacket<00:04:46.090> on<00:04:46.210> here

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
is a really tough outer jacket on here

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.670 
is a really tough outer jacket on here
I'm<00:04:48.430> not<00:04:48.970> surprised<00:04:49.419> that<00:04:49.450> I<00:04:49.840> had<00:04:50.050> to<00:04:50.260> go<00:04:50.440> ahead

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
I'm not surprised that I had to go ahead

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.250 
I'm not surprised that I had to go ahead
and<00:04:50.830> Nick<00:04:51.070> the<00:04:51.370> outer<00:04:51.940> jacket<00:04:52.630> to<00:04:52.750> get<00:04:52.930> just<00:04:53.169> to
