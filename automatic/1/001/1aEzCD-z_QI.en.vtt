00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
the trigger after because most people

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.820 
the trigger after because most people
think<00:02:36.160> that<00:02:36.640> if<00:02:36.760> you<00:02:36.880> don't<00:02:37.030> if<00:02:37.390> you<00:02:37.630> yummy<00:02:38.500> if

the<00:02:39.160> trigger<00:02:39.370> won't<00:02:39.610> work<00:02:39.790> before<00:02:40.150> but<00:02:40.480> it

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
the trigger won't work before but it

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:54.280 
the trigger won't work before but it
will<00:02:40.980> so<00:02:42.209> I'll<00:02:43.209> just<00:02:43.420> give<00:02:43.600> you<00:02:43.630> testing

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:52.990 

sorry<00:02:55.290> guys

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.250 

so<00:03:54.470> you<00:03:55.470> just<00:03:56.420> you<00:03:57.420> would<00:03:57.599> just<00:03:57.810> hold<00:03:58.109> your

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
so you just you would just hold your

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.759 
so you just you would just hold your
finger<00:03:58.409> down<00:03:58.560> right<00:03:59.159> there<00:04:00.560> hold<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:01.650> finger

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
finger down right there hold the finger

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.379 
finger down right there hold the finger
down<00:04:02.069> and<00:04:02.639> if<00:04:02.909> I<00:04:03.030> just<00:04:03.269> do<00:04:03.420> this<00:04:03.569> I<00:04:05.180> think<00:04:06.180> we

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:06.389 
down and if I just do this I think we

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:10.819 
down and if I just do this I think we
can<00:04:06.599> probably<00:04:06.750> see<00:04:07.109> so<00:04:08.000> you<00:04:09.000> you<00:04:09.959> just<00:04:09.989> pull

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
can probably see so you you just pull

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:16.670 
can probably see so you you just pull
your<00:04:10.859> finger<00:04:11.220> down<00:04:11.400> like<00:04:11.699> that<00:04:11.849> then<00:04:15.560> and<00:04:16.560> you

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
your finger down like that then and you

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.110 
your finger down like that then and you
can<00:04:16.829> see<00:04:16.979> it<00:04:17.099> automatically<00:04:17.639> fires<00:04:17.940> because

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
can see it automatically fires because

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.310 
can see it automatically fires because
you've<00:04:18.269> already<00:04:18.419> got<00:04:18.599> your<00:04:18.810> finger<00:04:19.109> on<00:04:19.139> the

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
you've already got your finger on the

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.189 
you've already got your finger on the
trigger<00:04:20.299> so<00:04:23.000> I'm<00:04:24.000> gonna<00:04:24.330> have<00:04:24.479> to<00:04:24.510> pick<00:04:24.810> up<00:04:24.960> all
