00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740

whatever but the idea was that you were
either<00:00:22.890> gonna<00:00:23.100> spray<00:00:23.460> through<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.760> stencil

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
either gonna spray through the stencil

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.849 
either gonna spray through the stencil
with<00:00:24.269> like<00:00:24.420> spray<00:00:24.689> paint<00:00:24.720> or<00:00:25.140> you're<00:00:25.769> gonna

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
with like spray paint or you're gonna

this<00:01:39.780> in<00:01:39.960> our<00:01:40.020> house<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:41.390> what<00:01:42.390> we're<00:01:42.509> gonna<00:01:42.570> do

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
this in our house so what we're gonna do

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.270 
this in our house so what we're gonna do
is<00:01:43.020> we're<00:01:43.200> actually<00:01:43.320> going<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.680> tape<00:01:43.920> an<00:01:44.070> image

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
is we're actually going to tape an image

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.859 
is we're actually going to tape an image
to<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.549> back<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.360> we're<00:01:45.479> gonna<00:01:45.570> cut

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
to the back of it and we're gonna cut

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.630 
to the back of it and we're gonna cut
through<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.170> top<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.680> looking<00:01:47.009> down<00:01:47.280> with

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
through the top of it looking down with

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.469 
through the top of it looking down with
an<00:01:47.939> exacto<00:01:48.420> blade<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.320> image<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:50.009> chose

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
an exacto blade so the image I chose

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.170 
an exacto blade so the image I chose
something<00:01:51.479> I'm<00:01:51.689> very<00:01:51.869> fond<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.759> but<00:01:53.759> I'm<00:01:54.000> not

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
something I'm very fond of but I'm not

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.550 
something I'm very fond of but I'm not
going<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.390> be<00:01:54.479> using<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.930> letters<00:01:55.229> I'm<00:01:55.380> just

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
going to be using the letters I'm just

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.810 
going to be using the letters I'm just
gonna<00:01:55.649> be<00:01:55.799> concentrating<00:01:56.430> all<00:01:56.640> on<00:01:56.729> the

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
gonna be concentrating all on the

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.730 
gonna be concentrating all on the
glassware<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.960> can<00:01:58.079> make<00:01:58.170> this<00:01:58.290> any<00:01:58.439> size

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
glassware and you can make this any size

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.289 
glassware and you can make this any size
you<00:01:58.950> want<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.310> want<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.520> make<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.759> fairly<00:01:59.939> big

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
you want you want to make it fairly big

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.899 
you want you want to make it fairly big
because<00:02:01.130> very<00:02:02.130> small<00:02:02.369> detail-oriented

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
because very small detail-oriented

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.399 
because very small detail-oriented
things<00:02:03.360> are<00:02:03.659> not<00:02:03.810> going<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:03.990> show<00:02:04.140> up<00:02:04.170> very

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
things are not going to show up very

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.950 
things are not going to show up very
well<00:02:04.439> on<00:02:04.710> egg<00:02:05.460> white<00:02:05.640> cocktails<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:06.240> make<00:02:06.810> sure

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
well on egg white cocktails so make sure

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.440 
well on egg white cocktails so make sure
that<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.170> make<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.439> image<00:02:07.560> nice<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.039> big

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
that you make the image nice and big

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.699 
that you make the image nice and big
it's<00:02:09.450> going<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.629> take<00:02:09.780> up<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:10.080> significant

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
it's going to take up a significant

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.229 
it's going to take up a significant
portion<00:02:10.979> of<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.760> plastic

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
portion of the plastic

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.869 
portion of the plastic
so<00:02:13.659> all<00:02:14.500> I'm<00:02:14.709> going<00:02:14.799> to<00:02:14.890> do<00:02:15.010> is<00:02:15.189> tape<00:02:15.579> this<00:02:15.700> to

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
so all I'm going to do is tape this to

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:17.220 
so all I'm going to do is tape this to
the<00:02:15.969> back<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:16.689> I'm<00:02:16.780> going<00:02:16.930> to<00:02:16.959> cut<00:02:17.109> through

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
the back and I'm going to cut through

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:56.400 
the back and I'm going to cut through
the<00:02:17.349> top<00:02:17.560> so<00:02:18.129> let's<00:02:18.459> have<00:02:19.060> some<00:02:19.209> fun<00:02:19.359> shall<00:02:19.390> we

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.590 

so<00:02:57.410> the<00:02:57.680> only<00:02:57.800> thing<00:02:58.040> left<00:02:58.520> to<00:02:58.640> do<00:02:58.820> for<00:02:59.150> this<00:02:59.390> is

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
so the only thing left to do for this is

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.110 
so the only thing left to do for this is
just<00:02:59.840> kind<00:03:00.050> of<00:03:00.140> clean<00:03:00.350> it<00:03:00.380> up<00:03:00.590> a<00:03:00.710> little<00:03:00.800> bit

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
just kind of clean it up a little bit

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.340 
just kind of clean it up a little bit
take<00:03:02.120> off<00:03:02.300> some<00:03:02.510> of<00:03:02.600> the<00:03:02.660> rough<00:03:02.840> edges<00:03:02.960> from

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
take off some of the rough edges from

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.350 
take off some of the rough edges from
the<00:03:03.530> cutting<00:03:03.830> and<00:03:03.980> just<00:03:04.790> give<00:03:04.940> it<00:03:05.030> a<00:03:05.060> good<00:03:05.150> wash

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
the cutting and just give it a good wash

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.490 
the cutting and just give it a good wash
and<00:03:05.390> after<00:03:05.840> that<00:03:05.960> we're<00:03:06.170> going<00:03:06.260> to<00:03:06.320> make<00:03:06.470> a

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
and after that we're going to make a

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:27.970 
and after that we're going to make a
drink<00:03:06.680> with<00:03:06.860> it

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.350 

so<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.160> only<00:03:29.280> thing<00:03:29.460> left<00:03:29.490> to<00:03:29.670> do<00:03:29.820> is<00:03:30.000> to<00:03:30.150> spray

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
so the only thing left to do is to spray

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.960 
so the only thing left to do is to spray
the<00:03:30.480> bitters<00:03:30.720> through<00:03:31.110> the<00:03:31.260> stencil<00:03:31.790> and<00:03:32.790> you

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
the bitters through the stencil and you

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.340 
the bitters through the stencil and you
want<00:03:33.150> to<00:03:33.210> get<00:03:33.270> the<00:03:33.450> stencil<00:03:33.780> as<00:03:33.900> close<00:03:34.080> to<00:03:34.230> the

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
want to get the stencil as close to the

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.680 
want to get the stencil as close to the
egg<00:03:34.440> white<00:03:34.620> as<00:03:34.740> possible<00:03:35.280> it<00:03:36.030> just<00:03:36.060> so<00:03:36.300> happens

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
egg white as possible it just so happens

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.310 
egg white as possible it just so happens
that<00:03:36.750> this<00:03:37.050> lid<00:03:37.770> is<00:03:38.070> the<00:03:38.280> exact<00:03:38.760> size<00:03:39.060> as<00:03:39.450> this

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
that this lid is the exact size as this

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.120 
that this lid is the exact size as this
this<00:03:40.980> coupe<00:03:41.220> gloss<00:03:41.490> so<00:03:42.210> the<00:03:43.050> absolute<00:03:43.800> pure

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
this coupe gloss so the absolute pure

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.650 
this coupe gloss so the absolute pure
coincidence<00:03:44.340> but<00:03:45.120> it's<00:03:45.240> going<00:03:45.360> to<00:03:45.420> work<00:03:45.540> out

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
coincidence but it's going to work out

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.620 
coincidence but it's going to work out
really<00:03:45.780> well<00:03:45.900> for<00:03:46.050> this<00:03:46.320> demonstration<00:03:46.770> so

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
really well for this demonstration so

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
really well for this demonstration so
all<00:03:48.630> we're<00:03:48.840> going<00:03:48.930> to<00:03:48.990> do<00:03:49.140> is<00:03:49.260> put<00:03:49.470> this<00:03:49.590> right

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
all we're going to do is put this right

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.730 
all we're going to do is put this right
on<00:03:49.920> top<00:03:50.150> we're<00:03:51.150> going<00:03:51.660> to<00:03:51.810> spray<00:03:52.170> our<00:03:52.410> bitters

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
on top we're going to spray our bitters

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.520 
on top we're going to spray our bitters
right<00:03:53.100> over<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.459> top<00:03:53.730> and<00:03:54.050> and<00:03:55.050> let's<00:03:55.350> check

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
right over the top and and let's check

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:10.230 
right over the top and and let's check
it<00:03:55.650> out<00:03:55.740> shall<00:03:55.920> we

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.700 

so<00:04:10.840> there<00:04:11.020> you<00:04:11.110> have<00:04:11.170> it<00:04:11.290> it<00:04:11.470> turned<00:04:11.650> out

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:11.710 
so there you have it it turned out

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.400 
so there you have it it turned out
really<00:04:11.890> well<00:04:12.100> and<00:04:12.750> the<00:04:13.750> only<00:04:13.870> big<00:04:14.050> is<00:04:14.200> the

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
really well and the only big is the

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:15.570 
really well and the only big is the
biggest<00:04:14.680> consideration<00:04:15.220> that<00:04:15.310> you're<00:04:15.460> going

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
biggest consideration that you're going

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.450 
biggest consideration that you're going
to<00:04:15.610> have<00:04:15.790> when<00:04:16.680> designing<00:04:17.680> your<00:04:17.800> stencil<00:04:18.250> is

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:18.460 
to have when designing your stencil is

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.220 
to have when designing your stencil is
trying<00:04:18.880> to<00:04:18.940> figure<00:04:19.060> out<00:04:19.180> which<00:04:19.690> cocktail<00:04:20.170> to

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 
trying to figure out which cocktail to

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.800 
trying to figure out which cocktail to
drink<00:04:20.470> with<00:04:20.650> it<00:04:20.680> and<00:04:21.640> also<00:04:21.910> the<00:04:22.390> bitters<00:04:22.630> that

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
drink with it and also the bitters that

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.240 
drink with it and also the bitters that
you're<00:04:22.930> using<00:04:23.140> make<00:04:23.350> sure<00:04:23.530> obviously<00:04:23.680> that<00:04:24.010> it

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
you're using make sure obviously that it
