alright<00:00:02.100> here<00:00:02.370> we<00:00:02.399> are<00:00:02.489> back<00:00:02.729> again<00:00:02.879> here's

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
alright here we are back again here's

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.580 
alright here we are back again here's
the<00:00:04.550> main<00:00:05.550> board<00:00:06.060> video<00:00:06.870> board<00:00:07.170> taken<00:00:07.440> out<00:00:07.560> of

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:07.590 
the main board video board taken out of

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.460 
the main board video board taken out of
here<00:00:08.269> unfortunately<00:00:09.269> I<00:00:09.960> don't<00:00:10.200> have<00:00:10.380> any

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:10.470 
here unfortunately I don't have any

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.440 
here unfortunately I don't have any
service<00:00:10.769> information<00:00:11.130> on<00:00:11.490> this<00:00:11.640> TV<00:00:11.820> but<00:00:12.150> the

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
service information on this TV but the

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.900 
service information on this TV but the
part<00:00:12.690> that<00:00:12.840> really<00:00:12.930> bothers<00:00:13.380> me<00:00:13.639> if<00:00:14.639> you<00:00:14.760> take

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
part that really bothers me if you take

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.760 
part that really bothers me if you take
a<00:00:14.940> look<00:00:15.179> great<00:00:15.420> there<00:00:15.929> can<00:00:16.379> I<00:00:16.410> get<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.619> camera

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
a look great there can I get the camera

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.840 
a look great there can I get the camera
to<00:00:16.920> focus<00:00:18.710> and<00:00:19.710> as<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:19.890> can<00:00:19.980> see<00:00:20.039> this<00:00:20.490> part

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
to focus and as you can see this part

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.179 
to focus and as you can see this part
right<00:00:21.000> here<00:00:21.890> let's<00:00:22.890> see<00:00:23.310> get<00:00:24.000> over<00:00:24.210> there

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
right here let's see get over there

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:31.749 
right here let's see get over there
right<00:00:26.189> here<00:00:28.970> notice<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.240> center<00:00:31.050> pin<00:00:31.350> is

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
right here notice that the center pin is

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.520 
right here notice that the center pin is
missing<00:00:32.759> now<00:00:32.970> I<00:00:33.000> do<00:00:33.180> not<00:00:33.420> know<00:00:33.630> if<00:00:34.050> that's

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
missing now I do not know if that's

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:42.950 
missing now I do not know if that's
supposed<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:34.950> go<00:00:35.190> there<00:00:35.399> or<00:00:35.730> not<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:41.930> you<00:00:42.930> know

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
supposed to go there or not so you know

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.020 
supposed to go there or not so you know
since<00:00:43.230> this<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.590> junker<00:00:43.980> TV<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.730> know<00:00:44.790> just

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
since this is a junker TV you know just

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.780 
since this is a junker TV you know just
one<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.450> it's<00:00:46.350> now<00:00:46.530> my<00:00:46.860> project<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.550> might

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
one that it's now my project I might

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.990 
one that it's now my project I might
just<00:00:48.120> solder<00:00:48.780> or<00:00:49.140> across<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.370> see<00:00:50.670> if<00:00:50.730> it

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
just solder or across that and see if it

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.569 
just solder or across that and see if it
actually<00:00:51.500> improves<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.590> performance<00:00:52.770> or<00:00:53.460> if

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
actually improves the performance or if

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.069 
actually improves the performance or if
it<00:00:54.320> because<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.500> looks<00:00:55.860> like<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.670> was<00:00:56.820> cut<00:00:57.809> off

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
it because it looks like it was cut off

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.100 
it because it looks like it was cut off
of<00:00:58.140> there<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:59.390> don't<00:01:00.390> know<00:01:00.570> if<00:01:00.660> maybe<00:01:00.809> somebody

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
of there I don't know if maybe somebody

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.999 
of there I don't know if maybe somebody
was<00:01:01.260> attempting<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.680> replace<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.670> or<00:01:04.009> what

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
was attempting to replace that or what

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:08.809 
was attempting to replace that or what
but<00:01:05.999> that<00:01:06.329> looks<00:01:06.569> very<00:01:06.719> suspicious<00:01:07.520> that<00:01:08.520> part

00:01:08.809 --> 00:01:08.819 
but that looks very suspicious that part

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:12.230 
but that looks very suspicious that part
or<00:01:09.029> that<00:01:09.060> center<00:01:09.749> pin<00:01:10.850> center<00:01:11.850> like<00:01:11.999> for<00:01:12.149> this

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
or that center pin center like for this

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.620 
or that center pin center like for this
transistor<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.779> missing<00:01:14.060> well<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.329> looks<00:01:15.569> like

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
transistor is missing well it looks like

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.059 
transistor is missing well it looks like
it's<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.929> transistor<00:01:16.529> doesn't<00:01:16.770> look<00:01:16.859> like<00:01:17.009> a

00:01:17.059 --> 00:01:17.069 
it's a transistor doesn't look like a

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:19.760 
it's a transistor doesn't look like a
diode<00:01:18.079> sometimes<00:01:19.079> they<00:01:19.139> do<00:01:19.229> have<00:01:19.409> diodes<00:01:19.740> but

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
diode sometimes they do have diodes but

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.319 
diode sometimes they do have diodes but
usually<00:01:20.130> diodes<00:01:20.490> don't<00:01:20.609> even<00:01:20.849> have<00:01:20.999> a<00:01:21.029> center

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:21.329 
usually diodes don't even have a center

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:25.959 
usually diodes don't even have a center
pin<00:01:21.509> coming<00:01:21.749> protruding<00:01:22.259> out<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.499> them<00:01:22.619> so

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:25.969 

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:30.730 

that's<00:01:26.969> kind<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.389> got<00:01:27.479> me<00:01:27.689> going<00:01:28.279> there<00:01:29.329> but

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
that's kind of got me going there but

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.949 
that's kind of got me going there but
before<00:01:31.740> oh<00:01:32.069> yeah<00:01:32.639> this<00:01:33.060> TV<00:01:33.389> has<00:01:33.509> actually<00:01:33.810> had

00:01:33.949 --> 00:01:33.959 
before oh yeah this TV has actually had

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:40.969 
before oh yeah this TV has actually had
some<00:01:34.139> work<00:01:34.289> done<00:01:34.319> to<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:38.539> there's<00:01:39.979> some

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
some work done to it there's some

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.479 
some work done to it there's some
evidence<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.490> some<00:01:41.729> damage<00:01:43.369> looks<00:01:44.369> like

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:44.489 
evidence of some damage looks like

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:46.399 
evidence of some damage looks like
somebody<00:01:44.759> is<00:01:44.789> trying<00:01:44.969> to<00:01:45.149> fix<00:01:45.810> this<00:01:45.989> board<00:01:46.289> at

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
somebody is trying to fix this board at

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.190 
somebody is trying to fix this board at
one<00:01:46.590> time<00:01:46.859> and<00:01:47.219> has<00:01:48.149> not<00:01:48.329> been<00:01:48.359> successful<00:01:49.109> at

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
one time and has not been successful at

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.889 
one time and has not been successful at
fixing<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.799> so<00:01:49.999> the<00:01:50.999> only<00:01:51.239> way<00:01:51.359> I<00:01:51.389> can<00:01:51.630> probably

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
fixing it so the only way I can probably

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.690 
fixing it so the only way I can probably
even<00:01:52.200> fix<00:01:52.469> this<00:01:52.619> TV<00:01:52.889> problem<00:01:53.219> now<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.399> just<00:01:53.609> to

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
even fix this TV problem now is just to

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.039 
even fix this TV problem now is just to
replace<00:01:53.969> this<00:01:54.209> board<00:01:56.539> it<00:01:57.539> looks<00:01:57.749> like<00:01:57.869> it's

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
replace this board it looks like it's

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.699 
replace this board it looks like it's
somebody's<00:01:58.979> try<00:01:59.489> to<00:01:59.549> jumper<00:02:00.179> and<00:02:00.709> these

00:02:01.699 --> 00:02:01.709 
somebody's try to jumper and these

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:04.190 
somebody's try to jumper and these
boards<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.609> cannot<00:02:03.090> fix<00:02:03.419> these<00:02:03.689> once<00:02:03.989> they

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
boards you cannot fix these once they

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.600 
boards you cannot fix these once they
break<00:02:05.599> so<00:02:06.599> I'm<00:02:07.020> looking<00:02:07.559> right<00:02:07.709> now<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.340> yes

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
break so I'm looking right now that yes

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.029 
break so I'm looking right now that yes
this<00:02:08.849> board<00:02:09.179> now<00:02:09.989> has<00:02:10.379> some<00:02:10.560> evidence<00:02:10.679> of

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
this board now has some evidence of

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.679 
this board now has some evidence of
repair<00:02:11.430> done<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.849> it<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.269> I<00:02:12.420> don't<00:02:12.480> think

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:12.689 
repair done to it and I don't think

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:12.840 
repair done to it and I don't think
there

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
there

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.030 
there
gonna<00:02:13.000> be<00:02:13.150> any<00:02:13.830> any<00:02:14.830> luck<00:02:15.100> for<00:02:15.280> this<00:02:15.400> board<00:02:17.040> as

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
gonna be any any luck for this board as

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.860 
gonna be any any luck for this board as
far<00:02:18.280> as<00:02:18.430> it<00:02:18.640> ever<00:02:18.760> working<00:02:19.180> properly<00:02:19.420> again

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
far as it ever working properly again

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.390 
far as it ever working properly again
just<00:02:20.050> because<00:02:20.380> of<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.590> fact<00:02:20.740> that<00:02:20.890> somebody

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
just because of the fact that somebody

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.720 
just because of the fact that somebody
has<00:02:21.640> been<00:02:22.540> trying<00:02:23.350> to<00:02:23.620> jumper<00:02:23.980> wires<00:02:24.220> and

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
has been trying to jumper wires and

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:32.850 
has been trying to jumper wires and
stuff<00:02:30.300> so<00:02:31.300> I'll<00:02:31.630> probably<00:02:31.750> just<00:02:31.990> go<00:02:32.260> on<00:02:32.500> eBay

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
stuff so I'll probably just go on eBay

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.730 
stuff so I'll probably just go on eBay
and<00:02:33.010> maybe<00:02:33.750> look<00:02:34.750> around<00:02:34.870> you<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.410> find<00:02:35.590> a

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
and maybe look around you and find a

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.960 
and maybe look around you and find a
replacement<00:02:35.950> board<00:02:36.370> may<00:02:36.490> even<00:02:36.640> find<00:02:36.790> one<00:02:36.940> of

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
replacement board may even find one of

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.790 
replacement board may even find one of
these<00:02:37.090> TVs<00:02:37.360> with<00:02:37.510> a<00:02:37.570> smash<00:02:37.810> screening<00:02:38.500> on<00:02:38.620> it

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
these TVs with a smash screening on it

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.370 
these TVs with a smash screening on it
and<00:02:40.080> replace<00:02:41.080> it<00:02:41.110> but<00:02:41.410> that<00:02:41.620> definitely<00:02:42.100> is

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
and replace it but that definitely is

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:49.680 
and replace it but that definitely is
attempt<00:02:44.380> to<00:02:44.500> repair<00:02:44.890> that<00:02:47.340> so<00:02:48.340> yep<00:02:49.120> this<00:02:49.390> TV

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
attempt to repair that so yep this TV

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.200 
attempt to repair that so yep this TV
sets<00:02:49.960> pretty<00:02:50.110> much<00:02:50.290> toast<00:02:50.730> because<00:02:51.730> there<00:02:52.060> is

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
sets pretty much toast because there is

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.940 
sets pretty much toast because there is
not<00:02:52.360> going<00:02:52.540> to<00:02:52.600> be<00:02:52.690> any<00:02:52.840> repair<00:02:53.200> to<00:02:53.380> this<00:02:53.560> set

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
not going to be any repair to this set

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.070 
not going to be any repair to this set
unless<00:02:54.400> of<00:02:55.300> course<00:02:55.360> I<00:02:55.630> can<00:02:55.780> find<00:02:55.990> a

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
unless of course I can find a

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
unless of course I can find a
replacement<00:02:56.200> board<00:03:00.270> but<00:03:01.920> otherwise<00:03:02.920> I'm<00:03:03.070> just

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
replacement board but otherwise I'm just

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.460 
replacement board but otherwise I'm just
gonna<00:03:03.250> use<00:03:03.460> the<00:03:03.550> parts<00:03:04.170> all<00:03:05.170> right<00:03:05.290> it's<00:03:05.380> all

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
gonna use the parts all right it's all

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.770 
gonna use the parts all right it's all
it's<00:03:05.590> good<00:03:05.740> for<00:03:05.770> anyway<00:03:06.270> this<00:03:07.270> room<00:03:07.480> might<00:03:07.660> be

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
it's good for anyway this room might be

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.660 
it's good for anyway this room might be
okay<00:03:08.050> so<00:03:08.110> I'm<00:03:08.410> gonna<00:03:08.590> hang<00:03:09.520> on<00:03:09.640> to<00:03:09.670> the<00:03:09.850> screen

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
okay so I'm gonna hang on to the screen

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.270 
okay so I'm gonna hang on to the screen
but<00:03:12.670> yeah<00:03:13.300> and<00:03:13.720> see<00:03:14.530> with<00:03:14.650> that<00:03:14.800> leg<00:03:15.010> they're

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
but yeah and see with that leg they're

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.940 
but yeah and see with that leg they're
missing<00:03:15.760> I<00:03:17.940> don't<00:03:18.940> think<00:03:19.300> that<00:03:19.480> I<00:03:19.750> don't<00:03:20.710> think

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
missing I don't think that I don't think

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.500 
missing I don't think that I don't think
this<00:03:21.010> boards<00:03:21.250> ever<00:03:21.370> gonna<00:03:21.490> work<00:03:21.640> again

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.820 

considering<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:25.690> damage<00:03:26.020> that<00:03:26.050> I<00:03:26.260> see<00:03:26.500> to<00:03:26.680> it

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
considering the damage that I see to it

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.700 
considering the damage that I see to it
and<00:03:27.300> now<00:03:28.300> that<00:03:28.480> I<00:03:28.570> see<00:03:28.750> that<00:03:28.870> leg<00:03:29.110> missing<00:03:29.500> so

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:29.710 
and now that I see that leg missing so

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.640 
and now that I see that leg missing so
there's<00:03:30.550> a<00:03:30.640> potential<00:03:31.090> that<00:03:31.780> I<00:03:31.960> could<00:03:32.290> jumper

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
there's a potential that I could jumper

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.840 
there's a potential that I could jumper
that<00:03:32.830> leg<00:03:33.160> and<00:03:33.400> it<00:03:33.490> might<00:03:33.610> fire<00:03:33.940> up<00:03:33.970> again<00:03:35.850> and

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
that leg and it might fire up again and

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.280 
that leg and it might fire up again and
since<00:03:37.120> I'm<00:03:37.210> gonna<00:03:37.300> be<00:03:37.420> pretty<00:03:37.690> much<00:03:37.810> scrapping

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
since I'm gonna be pretty much scrapping

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.960 
since I'm gonna be pretty much scrapping
out<00:03:38.550> its<00:03:39.550> TV<00:03:39.820> anyway<00:03:40.120> you<00:03:40.180> know<00:03:40.390> what<00:03:40.570> it's

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
out its TV anyway you know what it's

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.990 
out its TV anyway you know what it's
probably<00:03:42.970> not<00:03:43.030> gonna<00:03:43.150> really<00:03:43.330> hurt<00:03:43.510> to<00:03:43.720> try<00:03:43.870> it

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
probably not gonna really hurt to try it

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.160 
probably not gonna really hurt to try it
so<00:03:46.000> yeah<00:03:46.150> there's<00:03:46.330> been<00:03:46.510> somebody<00:03:46.690> muscling

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
so yeah there's been somebody muscling

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.950 
so yeah there's been somebody muscling
around<00:03:47.440> inside<00:03:47.740> of<00:03:47.890> this<00:03:47.980> TV<00:03:48.310> set<00:03:48.640> and<00:03:48.880> he<00:03:49.840> or

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:49.960 
around inside of this TV set and he or

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.220 
around inside of this TV set and he or
she<00:03:50.460> more<00:03:51.460> likely<00:03:51.700> was<00:03:51.850> he<00:03:52.090> didn't<00:03:53.050> know<00:03:53.110> what

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
she more likely was he didn't know what

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.000 
she more likely was he didn't know what
the<00:03:53.290> hell<00:03:53.410> he<00:03:53.500> was<00:03:53.530> doing

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
the hell he was doing

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.100 
the hell he was doing
so<00:03:54.520> I<00:03:54.910> ended<00:03:55.720> up<00:03:55.840> screwing<00:03:56.350> it<00:03:56.530> up<00:03:56.650> I<00:03:58.110> don't

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
so I ended up screwing it up I don't

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:00.390 
so I ended up screwing it up I don't
know<00:03:59.230> what<00:03:59.350> other<00:03:59.500> things<00:03:59.590> are<00:03:59.860> damaged<00:04:00.310> on

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
know what other things are damaged on

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.520 
know what other things are damaged on
here<00:04:00.610> either

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
here either

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.810 
here either
so<00:04:02.530> I<00:04:02.560> don't<00:04:02.860> know<00:04:02.920> if<00:04:02.980> this<00:04:03.100> team<00:04:03.250> you<00:04:03.340> this

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
so I don't know if this team you this

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:10.950 
so I don't know if this team you this
could<00:04:03.970> even<00:04:04.180> been<00:04:04.450> dropped<00:04:05.400> for<00:04:06.400> all<00:04:06.490> I<00:04:06.520> know

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:10.960 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.670 

so<00:04:11.960> yeah<00:04:12.580> anyway<00:04:13.610> that's<00:04:14.120> where<00:04:14.270> we're<00:04:14.360> at

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
so yeah anyway that's where we're at

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.650 
so yeah anyway that's where we're at
pretty<00:04:15.680> much<00:04:15.800> a<00:04:15.830> TV<00:04:16.549> that's<00:04:16.760> not<00:04:17.390> gonna<00:04:17.510> be

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
pretty much a TV that's not gonna be

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:18.370 
pretty much a TV that's not gonna be
repairable

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
repairable

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.650 
repairable
but<00:04:19.280> I'm<00:04:19.579> just<00:04:19.730> gonna<00:04:19.850> for<00:04:20.150> the<00:04:20.239> hell<00:04:20.480> of<00:04:20.510> it

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
but I'm just gonna for the hell of it

but I'm just gonna for the hell of it
just<00:04:20.810> gonna<00:04:21.019> try<00:04:21.350> to<00:04:21.410> probably<00:04:21.739> jumper<00:04:22.070> that

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
just gonna try to probably jumper that

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.600 
just gonna try to probably jumper that
transistor<00:04:23.120> there<00:04:24.010> I'm<00:04:25.010> not<00:04:25.310> gonna<00:04:25.490> probably

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
transistor there I'm not gonna probably

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:26.740 
transistor there I'm not gonna probably

ahead and put this off to the side and
come<00:04:33.260> back<00:04:33.320> to<00:04:33.500> it<00:04:33.590> at<00:04:33.680> a<00:04:33.710> later<00:04:33.740> time<00:04:33.980> see<00:04:34.490> if

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
come back to it at a later time see if

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.090 
come back to it at a later time see if
there's<00:04:34.730> any<00:04:34.970> hope<00:04:35.300> for<00:04:35.570> it<00:04:35.690> so<00:04:36.100> alrighty
