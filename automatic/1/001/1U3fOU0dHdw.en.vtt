00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.150

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.180
Hey guys! So I already have another book
haul

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.240
for you! My grandparents' church recently
had a huge

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.530
yard sale so of course I had to check it
out for books.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.970
The first several books I got actually
belonged to my parents but they were going to

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.440
give them to the yard sale.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.600
First is this copy of Catcher in the Rye.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.510
Now I read this back in high school and
have a copy leftover

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.300
but that one has tons of margin notes
and plus this cover is

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.570
way cooler. Next is Moby Dick by Herman
Melville

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.520
which I haven't read but I always
remember that scene in Matilda where

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.470
she starts reading it to

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.650
Miss Honey and I loved that movie growing up

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.810
and it's a classic. Third is a Farewell to
Arms by Ernest Hemingway

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.290
I haven't read this one but I have read The
Sun Also Rises

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.600
and this is another of Hemingway's
most-read novels

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.379
so it is a must-have. Next is Great
Expectations by Charles Dickens

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.610
I read A Christmas Carol back in high
school or something like that but I

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.350
haven't read

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.140
this one,  and it's one of his most
well-known so another must-have

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.510
Next is The Brothers Karamazov by

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.510
Fyodor Dostoyevsky. I read Crime and
Punishment back in senior year of

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.360
high school and thought it was
absolutely great so this will be a great

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.150
addition

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.500
to my small Russian literature
collection

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.780
and next is How to Sew a Button by

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.119
Erin Bried I think and I need this
because I don't know how to sew a button

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.060
other things that my grandmother knew. I also
got

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.939
the Watermelon King by Daniel Wallace
who is the same author as Big Fish

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.430
so hopefully this one is just as quirky
and entertaining.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.869
Next are these two beautiful things:

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.990
the Tragedies of Shakespeare and the
Histories and Poems

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.570
Shakespeare. I think I actually found
these at a yard sale several years ago

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.229
but put them with my parents collection
of books instead of my own,

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.299
and they were getting rid of these for the yard
sale so

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:12.680
I snatched them and now they are mine!

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.690
I've  read Romeo and Juliet and Hamlet

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.690
but now I can read King Lear

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.110
or Othello if I want to or even

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.319
Troilus and Cressida if I want to...

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.569
Unfortunately Volume 1 or

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.920
the Comedies of Shakespeare was not
included so I may just have to buy that

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.980
one online to complete the collection

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.170
and the final book which was actually
the

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.620
only one I actually found at the yard sale that didn't originally

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.640
belong to my parents and possibly the
most valuable

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.340
is this 1936 edition of the Adventures
of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.430
illustrated by Norman Rockwell. When I
saw this

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.750
I knew I had to have it. It's a little
water damaged and the spine is coming

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:01.370
apart

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.019
but still - 1936 Norman Rockwell.

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.230
Score! So that is 10 books in all which

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.769
is an amazing haul considering the
quality of these books.

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.200
I guess I owe it mostly to my parents for
having such a great

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.390
literature taste and I will definitely not
be wanting

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.760
anything to read for quite some time. So
I just

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.590
really wanna thank you for watching and
thank you for subscribing and I'll see

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:28.550
you next time

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.420
Bye!

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.150
now I read this back in high school and
have a copy leftover

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.580
but that one is
