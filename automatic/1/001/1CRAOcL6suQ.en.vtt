it<00:03:17.040> works<00:03:17.280> perfect<00:03:17.760> sometimes<00:03:18.000> it<00:03:18.330> goes<00:03:18.450> the

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
it works perfect sometimes it goes the

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:29.990 
it works perfect sometimes it goes the

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
first time sometimes it doesn't okay the

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.020 
first time sometimes it doesn't okay the
best<00:03:30.120> way<00:03:30.300> I<00:03:30.330> found<00:03:30.630> to<00:03:31.610> configure<00:03:32.610> it<00:03:32.730> is<00:03:32.850> to

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
best way I found to configure it is to

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.970 
best way I found to configure it is to
just<00:03:33.239> click<00:03:33.780> multiple<00:03:34.140> times<00:03:36.680> click<00:03:37.680> multiple

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
just click multiple times click multiple

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.009 
just click multiple times click multiple
times<00:03:38.340> and<00:03:38.519> press<00:03:38.760> a<00:03:38.790> bunch<00:03:39.060> of<00:03:39.150> times<00:03:39.330> that's

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
times and press a bunch of times that's

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.780 
times and press a bunch of times that's
that's<00:03:40.380> the<00:03:40.530> fastest<00:03:40.890> way<00:03:41.040> for<00:03:41.070> me<00:03:41.310> to<00:03:41.400> get<00:03:41.700> it

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
that's the fastest way for me to get it

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.770 
that's the fastest way for me to get it
configured<00:03:44.120> alright<00:03:45.120> so<00:03:45.269> once<00:03:45.450> you<00:03:45.540> have<00:03:45.660> that

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
configured alright so once you have that

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.050 
configured alright so once you have that
down<00:03:45.989> you<00:03:46.019> want<00:03:46.290> to<00:03:46.350> exit<00:03:46.590> out<00:03:47.000> alright<00:03:48.000> so

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
down you want to exit out alright so

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.490 
down you want to exit out alright so
