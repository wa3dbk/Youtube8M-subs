said<00:01:34.680> they<00:01:35.189> can<00:01:35.250> charge<00:01:35.729> up<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.060> eight<00:01:36.329> times

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
said they can charge up to eight times

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.660 
said they can charge up to eight times
faster<00:01:36.869> than<00:01:37.200> other<00:01:37.380> battery<00:01:37.890> packs<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:38.640> you

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
faster than other battery packs so you

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.670 
faster than other battery packs so you
can<00:01:38.850> actually<00:01:39.180> pack<00:01:39.360> enough<00:01:39.720> juice<00:01:40.020> in<00:01:40.259> the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
can actually pack enough juice in the

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.310 
can actually pack enough juice in the
ultra<00:01:41.070> pack<00:01:41.250> go<00:01:41.520> in<00:01:41.790> 15<00:01:42.329> minutes

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
ultra pack go in 15 minutes

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.060 
ultra pack go in 15 minutes
to<00:01:43.560> charge<00:01:43.890> up<00:01:44.130> your<00:01:44.189> iPhone<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:45.210> 100%<00:01:45.930> so<00:01:46.439> that

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
to charge up your iPhone to 100% so that

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.580 
to charge up your iPhone to 100% so that
is<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.310> very<00:01:47.909> cool<00:01:48.180> feature<00:01:48.450> in<00:01:48.750> my<00:01:48.899> opinion<00:01:48.930> and

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
is a very cool feature in my opinion and

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.710 
is a very cool feature in my opinion and
it<00:01:50.220> doesn't<00:01:50.549> hurt<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.700> have<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.149> ultra<00:01:51.509> packed

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
it doesn't hurt to have the ultra packed

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.260 
it doesn't hurt to have the ultra packed
or<00:01:51.930> either<00:01:52.170> as<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.680> packs<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.270> 10,000

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
or either as that packs a 10,000

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.179 
or either as that packs a 10,000
milliamp<00:01:54.659> hour<00:01:55.020> battery<00:01:55.170> now<00:01:55.680> I'm<00:01:55.770> not<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.950> fan

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
milliamp hour battery now I'm not a fan

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.609 
milliamp hour battery now I'm not a fan
of<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.490> glossy<00:01:57.090> design<00:01:57.509> here<00:01:57.899> as<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.380> does

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
of the glossy design here as it does

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.709 
of the glossy design here as it does
pick<00:01:58.950> up<00:01:58.979> fingerprints<00:01:59.880> easier<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.689> will

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
pick up fingerprints easier and it will

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.959 
pick up fingerprints easier and it will
probably<00:02:01.380> scratch<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.950> lot<00:02:02.100> easier<00:02:02.490> just<00:02:02.700> due

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
probably scratch a lot easier just due

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.149 
probably scratch a lot easier just due
to<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.299> glossy<00:02:03.659> finish<00:02:04.229> but<00:02:04.500> I'm<00:02:04.799> not<00:02:04.979> going

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
to that glossy finish but I'm not going

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.399 
to that glossy finish but I'm not going
to<00:02:05.250> ding<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.460> too<00:02:05.700> much<00:02:05.880> here<00:02:06.210> as<00:02:06.329> these<00:02:07.079> are

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
to ding it too much here as these are

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.410 
to ding it too much here as these are
pretty<00:02:08.069> awesome<00:02:08.580> in<00:02:08.670> my<00:02:08.700> opinion<00:02:08.819> they're

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
pretty awesome in my opinion they're

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.660 
pretty awesome in my opinion they're
very<00:02:09.780> high<00:02:10.050> quality<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.770> they're<00:02:11.370> pretty

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
very high quality and they're pretty

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.160 
very high quality and they're pretty
much<00:02:11.760> a<00:02:11.819> mirror<00:02:12.090> image<00:02:12.239> of<00:02:12.510> each<00:02:12.660> other<00:02:12.780> aside

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
much a mirror image of each other aside

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.790 
much a mirror image of each other aside
from<00:02:13.379> the<00:02:13.560> fact

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
from the fact

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.170 
from the fact
that<00:02:13.920> one<00:02:14.100> smaller<00:02:14.430> with<00:02:14.700> less<00:02:14.910> battery

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
that one smaller with less battery

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.370 
that one smaller with less battery
capacity<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:16.020> one<00:02:16.800> has<00:02:17.220> two<00:02:17.760> USB<00:02:17.970> ports<00:02:18.720> but<00:02:19.170> I

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
capacity and one has two USB ports but I

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.530 
capacity and one has two USB ports but I
do<00:02:19.560> like<00:02:20.280> them<00:02:20.520> in<00:02:20.730> general<00:02:21.120> overall<00:02:21.390> I'd

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
do like them in general overall I'd

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.320 
do like them in general overall I'd
probably<00:02:21.810> pick<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.560> ultra<00:02:23.160> pack<00:02:23.340> go<00:02:23.610> over<00:02:24.180> the

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
probably pick the ultra pack go over the

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.270 
probably pick the ultra pack go over the
ultra<00:02:24.630> packed<00:02:24.810> or<00:02:24.990> just<00:02:25.290> because<00:02:25.440> it's<00:02:25.620> small

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
ultra packed or just because it's small

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.070 
ultra packed or just because it's small
enough<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.700> fit<00:02:26.880> in<00:02:27.000> my<00:02:27.150> pocket<00:02:27.360> without

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
enough to fit in my pocket without

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.290 
enough to fit in my pocket without
adding<00:02:28.500> too<00:02:28.710> much<00:02:28.890> bulk<00:02:29.160> as<00:02:29.400> you<00:02:29.760> can<00:02:29.910> see<00:02:30.060> here

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
adding too much bulk as you can see here

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.420 
adding too much bulk as you can see here
the<00:02:30.450> ultra<00:02:30.900> pack<00:02:31.110> tour<00:02:31.350> is<00:02:31.560> much<00:02:31.800> larger<00:02:32.220> and

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
the ultra pack tour is much larger and

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.460 
the ultra pack tour is much larger and
more<00:02:32.640> suited<00:02:33.090> for<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.360> backpack<00:02:33.960> but<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.290> does

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
more suited for a backpack but it does

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.230 
more suited for a backpack but it does
have<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.830> ability<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.280> charge<00:02:35.760> up<00:02:36.030> two

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
have the ability to charge up two

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.400 
have the ability to charge up two
devices<00:02:36.840> at<00:02:36.990> once

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
devices at once

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.200 
devices at once
so<00:02:37.650> that<00:02:37.800> may<00:02:37.950> be<00:02:37.980> beneficial<00:02:38.550> for<00:02:38.880> some<00:02:39.090> of

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
so that may be beneficial for some of

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.000 
so that may be beneficial for some of
you<00:02:39.390> but<00:02:39.750> overall<00:02:40.020> I<00:02:40.110> think<00:02:40.290> these<00:02:40.560> are<00:02:40.620> both

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
you but overall I think these are both

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.250 
you but overall I think these are both
high<00:02:41.430> quality<00:02:41.460> battery<00:02:42.330> packs<00:02:42.630> and<00:02:42.840> they<00:02:43.200> do

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
high quality battery packs and they do

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.290 
high quality battery packs and they do
have<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.650> ability<00:02:43.740> to<00:02:44.100> charge<00:02:44.400> much<00:02:44.790> faster

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
have the ability to charge much faster

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.300 
have the ability to charge much faster
than<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.660> traditional<00:02:45.900> ones<00:02:46.590> so<00:02:47.070> go<00:02:47.190> ahead

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
than the traditional ones so go ahead

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.980 
than the traditional ones so go ahead
and<00:02:47.430> check<00:02:47.670> them<00:02:47.820> out<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.090> ultra<00:02:48.450> pack<00:02:48.600> Co<00:02:48.780> is
