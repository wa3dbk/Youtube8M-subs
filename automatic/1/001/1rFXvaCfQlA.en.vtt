00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.600
 t 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:18.310
 ned 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.119
 the world top percent 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.820
 The Germans would play the lead role in the 16-meter Finn class one 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.779
 year or 6 6 when we first had a stadium in los angeles 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:29.599
 times 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.079
 but you should not do the government because I have never had an untrue word and 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.079
 fired 7 years earlier 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.780
 he's locked in 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.310
 susan supercharger and good luck friends 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.750
 24 hour race 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.430
 we have ever had 7 0 before and 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.600
 it could be that they deny it was this year's direction london two 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.600
 times yes something just before the driveways continue 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.210
 i have a saas 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.920
 she's cute 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.920
 I do not make static is already the most opportunities 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.930
 the jensen program 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.260
 prior to the competition 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
 of course it is just as big as the club itself 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.150
 the previous month 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.150
 from that wrong 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.150
 we are not there yet 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.150
 yes i only have euros 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.060
 this the average 

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:23.699
 namely 100 dollars each 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:27.859
 a little bit it appears that the budget ap adb adha 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:29.769
 the band has with the same 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.769
 andy van der meyde 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.209
 just like courtney 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.269
 it's very simple 

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:11.929
 and when it's exciting 

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:15.059
 the Hardenberg lottery 

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:18.059
 risks 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.329
 the attacker who was still playing 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:40.979
 our thoughts are with arsenal 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.669
 my life like that 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.610
