when<00:00:27.900> I<00:00:27.990> was<00:00:28.109> in<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.260> big<00:00:28.410> 12<00:00:28.560> it's<00:00:29.160> kind<00:00:29.310> of

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
when I was in the big 12 it's kind of

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.400 
when I was in the big 12 it's kind of
the<00:00:29.490> known<00:00:29.640> that's<00:00:30.119> what<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.330> saw<00:00:30.660> in<00:00:30.929> that

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
the known that's what you saw in that

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.410 
the known that's what you saw in that
leg<00:00:31.650> but<00:00:31.920> they<00:00:32.099> are<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.640> they<00:00:33.000> were<00:00:33.059> even<00:00:33.270> a

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
leg but they are and they were even a

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.780 
leg but they are and they were even a
little<00:00:33.600> different<00:00:33.899> for<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.170> leg<00:00:34.380> area<00:00:35.160> they

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
little different for that leg area they

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.110 
little different for that leg area they
do<00:00:35.850> an<00:00:36.030> outstanding<00:00:36.270> job<00:00:37.610> I<00:00:40.820> think<00:00:41.820> we've<00:00:41.940> made

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
do an outstanding job I think we've made

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.639 
do an outstanding job I think we've made
some<00:00:42.300> steps<00:00:42.510> for<00:00:42.840> but<00:00:42.989> we'll<00:00:43.110> find<00:00:43.350> out<00:00:43.500> in

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
some steps for but we'll find out in

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.470 
some steps for but we'll find out in
September<00:00:44.430> first<00:00:44.670> as<00:00:44.910> we<00:00:44.940> move<00:00:45.210> through<00:00:45.239> the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
September first as we move through the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.410 
September first as we move through the
season<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:45.989> know<00:00:46.050> talk<00:00:47.010> is<00:00:47.190> cheap<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.640> you

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
season you know talk is cheap and you

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.029

need to you need to play on game day and
I<00:00:50.789> think<00:00:51.239> we<00:00:51.390> have<00:00:51.420> made<00:00:51.690> tremendous<00:00:51.870> strides

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
I think we have made tremendous strides

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.880 
I think we have made tremendous strides
we're<00:00:53.879> deeper<00:00:54.300> we've<00:00:55.140> got<00:00:55.289> more<00:00:55.440> quality

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
we're deeper we've got more quality

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.619 
we're deeper we've got more quality
depth<00:00:56.129> where<00:00:56.399> older<00:00:56.699> or<00:00:56.850> more<00:00:57.059> mature<00:00:57.420> we

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
depth where older or more mature we

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:58.670 
depth where older or more mature we
understand<00:00:58.079> what<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.289> takes<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.590> be

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
understand what it takes to be

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.130 
understand what it takes to be
successful<00:00:59.449> we<00:01:00.449> had<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.600> lot<00:01:00.719> of<00:01:00.750> first-year

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
successful we had a lot of first-year

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.750 
successful we had a lot of first-year
starters<00:01:01.680> last<00:01:01.890> year<00:01:02.100> on<00:01:02.190> both<00:01:02.340> lines<00:01:02.520> of

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
starters last year on both lines of

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.160 
starters last year on both lines of
scrimmage<00:01:03.030> which<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.270> not<00:01:03.449> good<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.870> our<00:01:03.930> leg

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
scrimmage which is not good in our leg

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.149 
scrimmage which is not good in our leg
and<00:01:05.129> we<00:01:05.280> stroke<00:01:05.549> but<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:07.020> think<00:01:07.590> we<00:01:07.740> have<00:01:07.770> made

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
and we stroke but I think we have made

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.320 
and we stroke but I think we have made
the<00:01:08.280> strides<00:01:08.580> we<00:01:08.760> need<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.000> have<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.210> be

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
the strides we need to have to be

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:17.370 
the strides we need to have to be
