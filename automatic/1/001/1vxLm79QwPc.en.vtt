KIMBERLY COLE: We are here at
IDA in Hollywood, one of my

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:04.010
favorite places to rehearse.

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.440
I am in the last stages of
rehearsal for my music video

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.050
for "U Make Me Wanna,"

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.930
choreographed by Tricia Miranda.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.460
This is actually a dance song,
collaborating with Eddie

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.320
Amador and Garza.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.790
So it's kind of like
a collaboration.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.400
So it's not exactly a Kimberly
Cole record.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.120
Not necessarily a follow up to
"Smack U." But it's fun.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.610
It's the kind of track that
just makes you want

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:24.670
to get up and dance.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:25.732
You know, I haven't done
a video in about

00:00:25.732 --> 00:00:26.370
a year and a half.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.540
So for me, when I'm doing
something, I want it to be

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.750
high concept, creative,
something that is a surprise.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.730
So yeah, there's definitely
some acting

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.520
involved and some surprises.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.230
I don't know if you saw the
Kimberly Cole audition, but

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.310
it's definitely a continuation
of that.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.790
We started out the day as a
normal audition and the first

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.435
person who came in, about 30
minutes early, was this cute

00:00:48.435 --> 00:00:51.590
man carrying a sack lunch and
offered me a half eaten

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.140
sandwich and cookies.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.035
And I was like, OK.

00:00:54.035 --> 00:00:55.852
This Is going to be a fun day.

00:00:55.852 --> 00:00:57.102
[MUSIC - KIMBERLY COLE,
"U MAKE ME WANNA"]

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.459
KIMBERLY COLE: He has legit
moves, that's the thing.

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:07.280
You look at him, and
you're like, OK.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.260
Little bald head, NASA
sweatshirt, Mom jeans--

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.840
you love him already just
because of that.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.320
Then he busts out these moves
that are like Keith Apicary.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.310
And it's like his
signature step.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.000
I've been working with Trisha
for the past three years.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.280
She is my creative soul mate
when it comes to choreography.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.780
Her vision is insane.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.860
She is such an outside
the box thinker.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.480
TRICIA MIRANDA: For "U Make
Me Wanna," I had to go on

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.570
location first to get inspired
because I couldn't just start

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.310
with nothing.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.550
So there's a few locations
that inspired me to

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.890
choreograph a certain way.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.320
And I do most of my choreography
in my head.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.770
Honestly, it's really
super weird.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.790
I don't dance in the mirror.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.790
I never come to the studio
to choreograph.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.340
I sit on the couch, put on my
headphones, and then I'll put

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.727
it on one of my assistants to
see what it looks like and to

00:01:54.727 --> 00:01:55.900
see if I like it.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.850
KIMBERLY COLE: I feel like
people look at her stuff and

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.730
you get energized from it.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:00.370
It's fun.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.860
It's just everything.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.885
When I was first ready to work
with her, I was sent all sorts

00:02:04.885 --> 00:02:06.510
of choreographers
who are amazing.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:07.470
But she stuck out to me.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.370
She's like my match.
