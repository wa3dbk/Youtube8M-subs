a tailor and a milliner their influence

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.529 
a tailor and a milliner their influence
on<00:00:28.320> me<00:00:28.470> was<00:00:28.650> probably<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.250> bit<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.699> fusion

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
on me was probably a bit of a fusion

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.270 
on me was probably a bit of a fusion
between<00:00:30.840> my<00:00:31.260> my<00:00:32.570> my<00:00:33.570> aunty<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.050> my<00:00:34.800> mum<00:00:35.040> I'm

between my my my aunty and my mum I'm

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.030 
between my my my aunty and my mum I'm
probably<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.790> bit<00:00:36.030> like<00:00:36.300> both<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.410> them<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:37.559> can

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
probably a bit like both of them I can

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.299 
probably a bit like both of them I can
be<00:00:38.219> very<00:00:39.469> analytical<00:00:40.469> in<00:00:40.590> what<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:40.770> do<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.070> I

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
be very analytical in what I do and I

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.440 
be very analytical in what I do and I
can<00:00:41.520> also<00:00:41.670> be<00:00:42.090> like<00:00:42.660> pretty<00:00:43.379> free<00:00:43.920> and

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
can also be like pretty free and

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:51.590 
can also be like pretty free and
creative<00:00:45.450> with<00:00:45.930> it

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.800 

for<00:00:52.290> me<00:00:53.000> design<00:00:54.000> has<00:00:54.150> been<00:00:54.270> something<00:00:54.660> that

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:54.810 
for me design has been something that

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.319 
for me design has been something that
I've<00:00:55.110> always<00:00:55.650> done<00:00:56.010> since<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.400> was<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.730> really

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
I've always done since I was a really

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.990 
I've always done since I was a really
young<00:00:57.480> person<00:00:58.050> my<00:00:58.650> career<00:00:59.040> was<00:00:59.220> basically<00:00:59.700> an

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
young person my career was basically an

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.450 
young person my career was basically an
inevitable<00:01:00.809> thing<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.650> I<00:01:01.680> was<00:01:01.860> going<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.280> do

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
inevitable thing that I was going to do

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.479 
inevitable thing that I was going to do
since<00:01:02.790> I<00:01:03.000> was<00:01:03.120> around<00:01:03.329> about<00:01:03.600> 10<00:01:03.900> it's<00:01:04.140> sort<00:01:04.350> of

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
since I was around about 10 it's sort of

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.430 
since I was around about 10 it's sort of
I<00:01:05.489> guess<00:01:05.670> it's<00:01:06.119> developed<00:01:06.720> into<00:01:06.960> focus<00:01:07.290> and

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
I guess it's developed into focus and

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.190 
I guess it's developed into focus and
design<00:01:07.740> but<00:01:07.979> it's<00:01:08.130> really<00:01:08.550> probably<00:01:09.210> started

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
design but it's really probably started

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.960 
design but it's really probably started
with<00:01:10.320> wanting<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.650> make<00:01:10.979> things<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.550> loving

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
with wanting to make things and loving

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.249 
with wanting to make things and loving
to<00:01:12.090> make<00:01:12.240> things<00:01:12.509> as<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.750> kid

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
to make things as a kid

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.430 
to make things as a kid
I<00:01:13.290> grew<00:01:14.190> up<00:01:14.220> like<00:01:14.640> in<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.180> around<00:01:15.390> Cronulla<00:01:16.020> my

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
I grew up like in and around Cronulla my

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.219 
I grew up like in and around Cronulla my
memories<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:16.920> would<00:01:17.640> be<00:01:17.850> swimming<00:01:18.360> out<00:01:18.840> with

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
memories of would be swimming out with

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.290

through<00:01:41.940> I<00:01:41.970> think<00:01:42.440> the<00:01:43.440> way<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:43.920> grew<00:01:44.039> up

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
through I think the way that I grew up

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.900 
through I think the way that I grew up
with<00:01:44.630> pool<00:01:45.630> parties<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.979> know<00:01:47.009> relaxed

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
with pool parties and you know relaxed

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.260 
with pool parties and you know relaxed
fun<00:01:48.570> kind<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.140> way<00:01:49.289> is<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:50.070> part<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.880> what<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.179> is

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
fun kind of way is a part of what it is

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:59.990 
fun kind of way is a part of what it is
that<00:01:51.479> we<00:01:51.600> do

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.359

have<00:02:19.870> a<00:02:19.900> function<00:02:20.200> so<00:02:20.680> I<00:02:20.709> guess<00:02:21.069> our<00:02:21.340> room<00:02:21.849> is

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
have a function so I guess our room is

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.030 
have a function so I guess our room is
in<00:02:22.420> us<00:02:22.569> you<00:02:23.019> know<00:02:23.140> it<00:02:23.319> works<00:02:23.530> for<00:02:23.680> me<00:02:23.890> in<00:02:23.980> a

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
in us you know it works for me in a

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.640 
in us you know it works for me in a
similar<00:02:24.430> way<00:02:24.459> it's<00:02:25.360> white<00:02:25.720> it<00:02:26.080> has<00:02:26.290> polished

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
similar way it's white it has polished

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.009 
similar way it's white it has polished
concrete<00:02:26.920> floors<00:02:27.549> but<00:02:27.940> there's<00:02:28.269> beautiful

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
concrete floors but there's beautiful

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.190 
concrete floors but there's beautiful
pictures<00:02:29.680> around<00:02:30.220> there's<00:02:30.760> amazing<00:02:31.599> prints

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
pictures around there's amazing prints

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.530 
pictures around there's amazing prints
being<00:02:32.500> developed<00:02:33.010> here<00:02:33.099> and<00:02:33.340> there<00:02:33.549> so<00:02:33.880> it

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
being developed here and there so it

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.430 
being developed here and there so it
works<00:02:35.160> streamline<00:02:36.160> and<00:02:36.489> for<00:02:37.390> me<00:02:37.569> it<00:02:37.959> might<00:02:38.230> be

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
works streamline and for me it might be

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.030 
works streamline and for me it might be
the<00:02:38.769> Virgo<00:02:39.160> in<00:02:39.340> me<00:02:39.519> I<00:02:39.790> like<00:02:40.120> it<00:02:40.150> tidy

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
the Virgo in me I like it tidy

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.319 
the Virgo in me I like it tidy
I<00:02:43.590> think<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.799> progression<00:02:45.459> of<00:02:45.610> how<00:02:45.819> I've<00:02:46.030> seen

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
I think the progression of how I've seen

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:49.289 
I think the progression of how I've seen
fashion<00:02:47.260> expressed<00:02:47.739> from<00:02:48.670> when<00:02:49.060> we<00:02:49.269> started

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
fashion expressed from when we started

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:54.110 
fashion expressed from when we started
to<00:02:50.230> where<00:02:50.440> it<00:02:50.620> is<00:02:50.739> now<00:02:51.010> is<00:02:51.370> like<00:02:52.209> Polar's<00:02:53.110> apart

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
to where it is now is like Polar's apart

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.170 
to where it is now is like Polar's apart
when<00:02:55.120> we<00:02:55.239> first<00:02:55.480> started<00:02:55.900> was<00:02:56.019> such<00:02:56.260> a<00:02:56.290> small

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
when we first started was such a small

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.280 
when we first started was such a small
majority<00:02:58.180> of<00:02:58.569> people<00:02:58.959> that<00:02:59.079> were<00:02:59.170> actually

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
majority of people that were actually

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.059 
majority of people that were actually
interested<00:03:00.040> in<00:03:00.129> fashion<00:03:00.459> and<00:03:00.670> it<00:03:00.849> was<00:03:00.970> very

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
interested in fashion and it was very

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.650 
interested in fashion and it was very
very<00:03:03.069> much<00:03:03.370> dictated<00:03:03.700> from<00:03:04.090> what<00:03:04.510> was

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
very much dictated from what was

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.259 
very much dictated from what was
happening<00:03:04.709> internationally<00:03:05.709> and<00:03:06.250> and<00:03:06.459> I<00:03:07.120> mean

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
happening internationally and and I mean

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.190 
happening internationally and and I mean
all<00:03:07.510> of<00:03:07.540> this<00:03:07.750> has<00:03:07.989> to<00:03:08.170> do<00:03:08.350> with<00:03:08.380> new<00:03:08.980> media<00:03:09.459> and

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
where that is now which is a hundred

where that is now which is a hundred
percent<00:03:17.139> immediate<00:03:18.069> and<00:03:18.220> whatever<00:03:19.150> you<00:03:19.450> do<00:03:19.690> is

out there then now and I mean it's

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.690
