00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
we've been putting a lot of hard work

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.670 
we've been putting a lot of hard work
over<00:01:27.100> the<00:01:27.310> past<00:01:27.960> 20<00:01:28.960> years<00:01:28.990> or<00:01:29.320> so<00:01:29.530> and<00:01:29.619> we

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
over the past 20 years or so and we

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.160 
over the past 20 years or so and we
think<00:01:29.860> this<00:01:29.979> is<00:01:30.100> a<00:01:30.130> big<00:01:30.340> payoff<00:01:30.549> for<00:01:30.939> it<00:01:31.090> so<00:01:31.329> you

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
think this is a big payoff for it so you

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.649 
think this is a big payoff for it so you
know<00:01:32.259> this<00:01:32.409> is<00:01:32.530> this<00:01:32.799> is<00:01:32.920> just<00:01:33.070> our<00:01:33.359> our<00:01:34.359> this

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
know this is this is just our our this

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.300 
know this is this is just our our this
is<00:01:34.840> our<00:01:34.960> dream<00:01:35.259> come<00:01:35.530> true<00:01:35.740> we're<00:01:35.920> so<00:01:36.070> glad<00:01:36.219> to

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
is our dream come true we're so glad to

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.670 
is our dream come true we're so glad to
be<00:01:36.430> here<00:01:36.729> I<00:01:36.969> think<00:01:37.420> that<00:01:37.630> with<00:01:37.869> Colorado<00:01:38.439> when

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
be here I think that with Colorado when

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.310 
be here I think that with Colorado when
you<00:01:38.799> talk<00:01:39.070> joining<00:01:39.850> the<00:01:40.229> MAL<00:01:41.229> pac-12<00:01:42.000> we

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
you talk joining the MAL pac-12 we

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.249 
you talk joining the MAL pac-12 we
expanded<00:01:44.320> our<00:01:44.880> area<00:01:45.880> into<00:01:46.539> the<00:01:46.570> the<00:01:46.929> mountain

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
expanded our area into the the mountain

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:48.599 
expanded our area into the the mountain
state<00:01:47.500> it<00:01:47.649> expands<00:01:47.979> the<00:01:48.039> footprint

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:48.609 
state it expands the footprint

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:50.899 
state it expands the footprint
getting<00:01:49.539> into<00:01:49.689> Utah<00:01:49.990> and<00:01:50.049> getting<00:01:50.439> in

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
getting into Utah and getting in

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.849 
getting into Utah and getting in
I<00:01:50.939> think<00:01:51.450> really<00:01:51.810> helps<00:01:52.049> me<00:01:52.320> it's<00:01:52.619> really

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:52.859 
I think really helps me it's really

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:54.319 
I think really helps me it's really
exciting<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.460> it's<00:01:53.549> great<00:01:53.729> for<00:01:53.880> Colorado

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329
