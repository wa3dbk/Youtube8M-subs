he's<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.780> wouldn't<00:01:49.259> say<00:01:49.350> he<00:01:49.560> has<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.770> big<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.040> a

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.319 
he's I wouldn't say he has that big of a
chance<00:01:50.280> at<00:01:50.430> this<00:01:50.579> point<00:01:50.790> there's<00:01:50.970> too<00:01:51.090> much<00:01:51.180> of

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
chance at this point there's too much of

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.499 
chance at this point there's too much of
a<00:01:51.390> life<00:01:51.570> lead<00:01:51.869> on<00:01:52.079> Zach's<00:01:52.470> part<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:53.880> let's<00:01:54.240> see

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
if zach can pull this out pretty easily

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.600
