conditions<00:01:39.880> are<00:01:40.119> bad<00:01:40.330> here<00:01:41.280> but<00:01:42.280> anyway<00:01:42.640> let's

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
conditions are bad here but anyway let's

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.590 
conditions are bad here but anyway let's
start<00:01:43.740> like<00:01:44.740> I<00:01:44.770> told<00:01:45.009> you<00:01:45.160> it's<00:01:46.060> made<00:01:46.330> by

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
start like I told you it's made by

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.070 
start like I told you it's made by
practical<00:01:47.320> and<00:01:48.090> when<00:01:49.090> I<00:01:49.119> remove<00:01:49.720> the<00:01:50.560> lens<00:01:50.770> cap

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
practical and when I remove the lens cap

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.050 
practical and when I remove the lens cap
you<00:01:53.080> can<00:01:53.110> see<00:01:55.410> the<00:01:56.410> magnification<00:01:57.160> range<00:01:57.400> from

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
you can see the magnification range from

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.410 
you can see the magnification range from
25<00:01:58.810> to<00:01:59.590> 50<00:02:00.070> to<00:02:00.460> 75<00:02:01.210> and<00:02:01.659> I<00:02:02.140> think<00:02:02.409> at<00:02:02.560> 75<00:02:03.280> we<00:02:04.210> use

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
25 to 50 to 75 and I think at 75 we use

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.740 
25 to 50 to 75 and I think at 75 we use
a<00:02:04.690> lot<00:02:04.990> of<00:02:05.170> picture<00:02:05.770> information<00:02:06.390> but<00:02:07.390> we'll

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
a lot of picture information but we'll

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.440 
a lot of picture information but we'll
test<00:02:08.050> it<00:02:08.260> later

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
test it later

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.350 
test it later
here<00:02:10.450> you<00:02:10.600> can<00:02:11.220> focus<00:02:12.220> the<00:02:12.760> range<00:02:12.970> from<00:02:13.150> 10

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
here you can focus the range from 10

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.009 
here you can focus the range from 10
meters<00:02:13.480> to<00:02:14.050> infinity<00:02:14.560> and<00:02:15.330> an<00:02:16.330> eye<00:02:16.480> thing<00:02:16.780> is

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
meters to infinity and an eye thing is

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.100 
meters to infinity and an eye thing is
if<00:02:17.380> you<00:02:17.650> lose<00:02:17.830> this<00:02:18.430> screw<00:02:18.700> here<00:02:19.060> you<00:02:19.930> can

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
if you lose this screw here you can

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.150 
if you lose this screw here you can
adjust<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:21.190> angle<00:02:22.440> let's<00:02:23.440> tighten<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:24.040> again

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
adjust the angle let's tighten it again

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.440 
adjust the angle let's tighten it again
and<00:02:25.650> I<00:02:26.650> told<00:02:26.920> you<00:02:27.040> before<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.910> whole<00:02:28.060> spotting

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
and I told you before the whole spotting

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.550 
and I told you before the whole spotting
scope<00:02:28.720> is<00:02:28.959> rubber-coated

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.680 

ok<00:02:32.560> let's<00:02:32.830> remove<00:02:33.160> the<00:02:33.340> cap<00:02:33.519> here<00:02:33.910> can<00:02:34.239> see<00:02:34.480> the

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
ok let's remove the cap here can see the

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.699 
ok let's remove the cap here can see the
90<00:02:35.019> millimeter<00:02:35.380> objective<00:02:35.590> and<00:02:37.350> there<00:02:38.350> is<00:02:38.560> an

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
90 millimeter objective and there is an

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.680 
90 millimeter objective and there is an
adjustable<00:02:39.190> sunshade<00:02:39.910> also

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.780 

okay<00:02:43.690> but<00:02:44.050> now<00:02:44.260> let's<00:02:44.830> test<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.430> spotting

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
okay but now let's test the spotting

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.470 
okay but now let's test the spotting
scope<00:02:45.819> at<00:02:46.330> the<00:02:47.140> range<00:02:47.500> I<00:02:47.970> want<00:02:48.970> to<00:02:49.060> test<00:02:49.270> this

my<00:03:08.709> eyes<00:03:08.739> through<00:03:09.520> the<00:03:09.610> spotting<00:03:10.060> scope<00:03:10.090> and

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
my eyes through the spotting scope and

my eyes through the spotting scope and

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.840 
with an iPhone 4 so in reality quality
is<00:03:17.230> much<00:03:17.620> more<00:03:17.830> better<00:03:18.070> than<00:03:18.340> what<00:03:18.519> you<00:03:18.640> can

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
is much more better than what you can

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.890 
is much more better than what you can

at<00:03:21.890> 25<00:03:22.400> weeks<00:03:22.610> I<00:03:22.849> can<00:03:22.909> see<00:03:23.330> bullet<00:03:23.720> holes<00:03:23.780> in

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
at 25 weeks I can see bullet holes in

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.580 
at 25 weeks I can see bullet holes in
the<00:03:24.319> white<00:03:24.560> at<00:03:24.890> 300<00:03:25.489> meters<00:03:25.900> but<00:03:26.900> bullet<00:03:27.409> holes

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
the white at 300 meters but bullet holes

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.470 
the white at 300 meters but bullet holes
and<00:03:27.890> the<00:03:28.010> black<00:03:28.220> I<00:03:28.370> have<00:03:28.400> to<00:03:28.640> guess<00:03:28.879> the

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
and the black I have to guess the

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.940 
and the black I have to guess the
picture<00:03:29.870> was<00:03:30.260> sharp<00:03:30.590> was<00:03:30.980> clear<00:03:31.420> but

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
picture was sharp was clear but

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.890 
picture was sharp was clear but
magnification<00:03:33.950> was<00:03:34.129> not<00:03:34.310> high<00:03:34.640> enough<00:03:35.060> to<00:03:35.629> see

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
magnification was not high enough to see

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:45.940 
magnification was not high enough to see
bullet<00:03:36.830> holes<00:03:36.860> in<00:03:37.370> the<00:03:37.459> black

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.420 

add<00:03:46.390> 50x<00:03:47.390> I<00:03:47.569> can<00:03:47.810> see<00:03:48.110> bullet<00:03:48.770> holes<00:03:48.800> in<00:03:49.250> the

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
add 50x I can see bullet holes in the

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.420 
add 50x I can see bullet holes in the
white<00:03:49.610> and<00:03:49.849> the<00:03:50.150> black<00:03:50.360> with<00:03:51.260> no<00:03:51.500> problem<00:03:52.010> even

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
white and the black with no problem even

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.170 
white and the black with no problem even
at<00:03:52.640> a<00:03:52.670> cloudy<00:03:53.030> day<00:03:53.330> like<00:03:54.250> we<00:03:55.250> had<00:03:55.280> when<00:03:55.940> I<00:03:56.000> took

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
at a cloudy day like we had when I took

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.220 
at a cloudy day like we had when I took
this<00:03:56.510> picture<00:03:56.720> here<00:03:57.260> and<00:03:57.880> yeah<00:03:58.880> the<00:03:59.599> picture

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
this picture here and yeah the picture

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.580 
this picture here and yeah the picture
was<00:04:00.650> sharp<00:04:01.010> enough<00:04:01.130> and<00:04:02.170> this<00:04:03.170> magnification

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
was sharp enough and this magnification

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.400 
was sharp enough and this magnification
I<00:04:04.190> think<00:04:04.610> is<00:04:04.760> the<00:04:05.030> best<00:04:05.270> you<00:04:05.540> can<00:04:05.750> use<00:04:05.959> with<00:04:06.380> a

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
I think is the best you can use with a

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:12.830 
I think is the best you can use with a
spotting<00:04:06.830> scope<00:04:06.860> here

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.860 

at<00:04:13.010> 75<00:04:14.010> X<00:04:14.340> I<00:04:14.520> can<00:04:14.760> see<00:04:15.030> bullet<00:04:15.390> holes<00:04:15.420> and<00:04:15.750> the

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
at 75 X I can see bullet holes and the

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.270 
at 75 X I can see bullet holes and the
white<00:04:16.139> and<00:04:16.350> the<00:04:16.530> black

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
white and the black

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.710 
white and the black
also<00:04:17.940> but<00:04:18.810> at<00:04:19.200> 58<00:04:19.919> the<00:04:20.669> picture<00:04:21.060> Ross<00:04:21.389> career

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
also but at 58 the picture Ross career

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.220 
also but at 58 the picture Ross career
was<00:04:22.079> sharper<00:04:22.530> so<00:04:23.100> I<00:04:23.130> like<00:04:23.490> the<00:04:23.820> 50x<00:04:24.480> much<00:04:24.930> more

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
was sharper so I like the 50x much more

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:34.600 
was sharper so I like the 50x much more
than<00:04:25.650> the<00:04:25.830> 75<00:04:26.460> fix

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.980 

you

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.020 

I<00:04:39.190> think<00:04:40.190> for<00:04:40.370> the<00:04:40.490> money<00:04:40.669> it's<00:04:40.910> a<00:04:41.000> good

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
I think for the money it's a good

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.360 
I think for the money it's a good
spotting<00:04:41.509> scope<00:04:41.780> you<00:04:42.440> can't<00:04:42.710> compare<00:04:43.130> it<00:04:43.160> with

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
spotting scope you can't compare it with

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.490 
spotting scope you can't compare it with
the<00:04:43.550> cover<00:04:43.910> or<00:04:44.180> tie<00:04:44.389> spotting<00:04:44.810> scope<00:04:45.080> for<00:04:45.319> sure

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
the cover or tie spotting scope for sure

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.640 
the cover or tie spotting scope for sure
we<00:04:46.310> had<00:04:46.490> to<00:04:47.030> here<00:04:47.419> at<00:04:47.569> the<00:04:47.690> shooting<00:04:47.930> range<00:04:48.050> and

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
we had to here at the shooting range and

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.529 
we had to here at the shooting range and
with<00:04:49.460> both<00:04:49.849> of<00:04:50.120> them

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:50.539 
with both of them

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:52.629 
with both of them
I<00:04:50.569> can<00:04:51.169> see<00:04:51.410> bullet<00:04:51.770> holes<00:04:51.919> and<00:04:52.099> the<00:04:52.250> black<00:04:52.430> at

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 
I can see bullet holes and the black at

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:54.850 
I can see bullet holes and the black at
600<00:04:53.180> meters<00:04:53.479> and<00:04:53.780> with<00:04:54.289> the<00:04:54.410> practical

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
600 meters and with the practical

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.670 
600 meters and with the practical
spotting<00:04:55.190> scope<00:04:55.430> I<00:04:55.639> couldn't<00:04:56.199> but<00:04:57.199> I<00:04:57.259> think

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
spotting scope I couldn't but I think

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.320 
spotting scope I couldn't but I think
for<00:04:57.860> 300<00:04:58.370> meters<00:04:58.699> it's<00:04:59.030> okay<00:04:59.300> I<00:05:01.060> want<00:05:02.060> to<00:05:02.150> keep

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
for 300 meters it's okay I want to keep

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.300 
for 300 meters it's okay I want to keep
this<00:05:02.599> spotting<00:05:02.930> scope<00:05:03.259> until<00:05:03.710> I<00:05:03.740> have<00:05:04.039> safe

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
this spotting scope until I have safe

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.150 
this spotting scope until I have safe
enough<00:05:04.639> money<00:05:04.910> for<00:05:05.300> uncover<00:05:05.840> but<00:05:06.770> at<00:05:07.009> this

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
enough money for uncover but at this

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.600 
enough money for uncover but at this
time<00:05:07.430> I'm<00:05:07.940> not<00:05:08.000> able<00:05:08.870> to<00:05:09.020> spend<00:05:09.440> 3,000<00:05:10.250> euros

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
time I'm not able to spend 3,000 euros

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.180 
time I'm not able to spend 3,000 euros
foreign<00:05:11.360> spotting<00:05:11.720> scopes<00:05:11.990> so<00:05:12.229> I<00:05:12.259> think<00:05:12.380> for

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
foreign spotting scopes so I think for

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.100 
foreign spotting scopes so I think for
the<00:05:13.310> next<00:05:13.610> two<00:05:13.759> years<00:05:13.789> I<00:05:14.330> want<00:05:14.599> to<00:05:14.690> use<00:05:14.840> this

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
the next two years I want to use this

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.870 
the next two years I want to use this
practical<00:05:15.680> spotting<00:05:16.130> scope<00:05:16.400> here

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880
