00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.589
 today we have some of the friends of 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.200
 belkin it is one of the 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.460
 devices that is part of the family 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.530
 to control to make your places 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.929
 smarter we have seen the 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.090
 bulbs that you can control turn off and 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.730
 turn on through the internet too 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.769
 we have seen the motion sensors 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.380
 for today we have a wing 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.039
 board switch that allows any 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.570
 device that is connected to go 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.809
 turn it on or off remotely 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.070
 it also allows you to create different 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.890
 programs for him 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.100
 for example that sits at a time that 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.949
 turn off at another time 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.739
 also for example that at dawn it 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.960
 turn off the light or turn on at night 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.659
 You can control this through 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.180
 basically wifi connection 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:57.570
 any type of internet connection 3g 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.860
 4g or wifi we will be unpacking 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.860
 this in just seconds 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.479
 or that we proceed to the jump-off 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.850
 welcome 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.860
 and here are what would be the way 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.160
 installation remember that this is a 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.600
 connector is put on the device that we want 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:56.000
 control from kirk to the switch then 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.730
 we download the application either from 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.430
 android market or play goal store is 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:05.370
 call new app winmo hub we are going to 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.009
 settings in both cases settings 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.540
 we must be within the same wifi or 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.610
 connected to wifi 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.490
 we connect to webó and then we do 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.850
 the link of the application with our 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.950
 device is quite simple and 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.420
 we'll be bringing in let's see if the 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.040

 how fast is it through the internet or 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:55.010

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.000
