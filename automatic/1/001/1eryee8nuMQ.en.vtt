00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
best be using a salt for 18 650 this is

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.040 
best be using a salt for 18 650 this is
their<00:02:32.890> newest<00:02:33.220> one<00:02:33.370> to<00:02:33.490> version<00:02:33.580> 3<00:02:34.060> with<00:02:34.330> 2600

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
their newest one to version 3 with 2600

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.830 
their newest one to version 3 with 2600
milliamp<00:02:35.230> hour<00:02:35.650> capacity<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:37.120> version<00:02:37.450> 2<00:02:37.660> is

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
milliamp hour capacity the version 2 is

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.870 
milliamp hour capacity the version 2 is
only<00:02:38.100> 2400<00:02:39.100> million

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
only 2400 million

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.850 
only 2400 million
so<00:02:40.450> this<00:02:40.570> one<00:02:40.690> has<00:02:40.840> more<00:02:41.050> millet<00:02:41.680> more

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
so this one has more millet more

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.410 
so this one has more millet more
capacity<00:02:42.100> and<00:02:42.550> more<00:02:42.700> runtime<00:02:43.150> so<00:02:43.300> that's

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
capacity and more runtime so that's

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:51.380 
capacity and more runtime so that's
always<00:02:43.540> a<00:02:43.630> good<00:02:43.780> thing

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.200 

Surdas<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:53.410> ltte<00:02:53.890> with<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.340> m3<00:02:54.550> head

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.210 
Surdas the ltte with the m3 head

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:56.910 
Surdas the ltte with the m3 head
I<00:02:55.240> think<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:55.840> finished<00:02:56.200> matches<00:02:56.770> pretty

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
I think the finished matches pretty

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:05.580 
I think the finished matches pretty
nicely<00:02:59.310> with<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:01.870> m3<00:03:01.990> head<00:03:04.020> it's<00:03:05.020> not<00:03:05.170> exactly

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
nicely with the m3 head it's not exactly

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.310 
nicely with the m3 head it's not exactly
perfect<00:03:05.770> but<00:03:06.070> it's<00:03:06.190> very<00:03:06.310> very<00:03:06.550> close<00:03:07.320> so

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
perfect but it's very very close so

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.490

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:18.820 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:23.620 

this<00:06:19.820> was<00:06:20.000> the<00:06:20.180> sole<00:06:20.600> person<00:06:20.810> three<00:06:22.450> it's<00:06:23.450> got

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:23.630 
this was the sole person three it's got

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.950 
this was the sole person three it's got
a<00:06:23.660> cree<00:06:24.140> xml2<00:06:24.440> 7-under<00:06:25.430> lumens<00:06:25.820> nice<00:06:26.510> deep

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 
a cree xml2 7-under lumens nice deep

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:32.230 
a cree xml2 7-under lumens nice deep
smooth<00:06:27.260> reflector<00:06:29.710> and<00:06:30.710> compared<00:06:31.190> to<00:06:32.090> all

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240 
smooth reflector and compared to all

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:38.980 
smooth reflector and compared to all
these<00:06:32.420> i<00:06:32.780> think<00:06:33.650> it<00:06:33.710> matches<00:06:33.860> the<00:06:37.840> LTTE<00:06:38.840> the

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:38.990 
these i think it matches the LTTE the

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:43.830 
these i think it matches the LTTE the
best<00:06:40.450> close<00:06:41.450> second<00:06:41.810> would<00:06:41.930> be<00:06:42.020> l2<00:06:42.530> and<00:06:42.860> then<00:06:43.370> a

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840 
best close second would be l2 and then a

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.210 
best close second would be l2 and then a
third<00:06:44.840> will<00:06:45.020> be<00:06:45.050> l2<00:06:45.500> p<00:06:45.650> that's<00:06:45.770> because<00:06:46.070> the

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:46.220 
third will be l2 p that's because the

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.580 
third will be l2 p that's because the
LTP<00:06:46.460> has<00:06:46.670> a<00:06:46.850> it's<00:06:47.570> got<00:06:47.660> a<00:06:47.720> more<00:06:47.900> matte<00:06:48.140> finish

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:48.590 
LTP has a it's got a more matte finish

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.830 
LTP has a it's got a more matte finish
it's<00:06:49.040> got<00:06:49.280> that<00:06:49.400> hard<00:06:49.640> anodized<00:06:50.000> anti

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:50.840 
it's got that hard anodized anti

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.720 
it's got that hard anodized anti
abrasive<00:06:51.290> finish<00:06:51.590> so<00:06:52.250> it's<00:06:52.370> a<00:06:52.430> little<00:06:52.610> bit

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:52.730 
abrasive finish so it's a little bit

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.130 
abrasive finish so it's a little bit
more<00:06:52.910> matte<00:06:53.150> while<00:06:53.420> these<00:06:53.540> two<00:06:53.780> are<00:06:53.840> a<00:06:53.930> bit

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:54.140 
more matte while these two are a bit

00:06:54.140 --> 00:07:00.220 
more matte while these two are a bit
more<00:06:54.260> black<00:06:55.150> and<00:06:56.150> they'll<00:06:57.080> do<00:06:57.260> P<00:06:58.420> so<00:06:59.420> this<00:06:59.930> is<00:06:59.990> a

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:00.230 
more black and they'll do P so this is a
