by<00:04:08.139> by<00:04:08.590> hand<00:04:08.889> also<00:04:09.250> I<00:04:09.280> will<00:04:09.549> find<00:04:09.880> hard<00:04:10.180> to

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
by by hand also I will find hard to

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.479 
by by hand also I will find hard to
believe<00:04:10.650> they<00:04:11.650> I<00:04:11.680> would<00:04:11.920> imagine<00:04:12.100> that<00:04:12.310> they

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
believe they I would imagine that they

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.729 
believe they I would imagine that they
are<00:04:12.519> they<00:04:12.760> have<00:04:12.970> to<00:04:13.000> be<00:04:13.150> machine<00:04:13.660> grind<00:04:14.019> to<00:04:14.620> do

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
are they have to be machine grind to do

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:16.590 
are they have to be machine grind to do
such<00:04:15.010> a<00:04:15.040> huge<00:04:15.340> number<00:04:15.760> so<00:04:15.790> would<00:04:16.090> be<00:04:16.180> too<00:04:16.389> much

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
such a huge number so would be too much

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.719 
such a huge number so would be too much
especially<00:04:16.989> at<00:04:17.289> the<00:04:17.380> price<00:04:17.500> point<00:04:17.729> think

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
especially at the price point think

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:22.620 
especially at the price point think
these<00:04:18.850> are<00:04:18.910> 350<00:04:19.690> right<00:04:20.320> or<00:04:20.620> 300<00:04:21.519> actually<00:04:22.270> very

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
these are 350 right or 300 actually very

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.779 
these are 350 right or 300 actually very
very<00:04:22.930> reasonable<00:04:23.500> price<00:04:23.710> point<00:04:24.039> I<00:04:24.099> think<00:04:24.159> they

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
very reasonable price point I think they

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:26.190 
very reasonable price point I think they
two<00:04:24.849> blade<00:04:25.180> you<00:04:25.390> know<00:04:25.479> Jason<00:04:25.900> is<00:04:25.960> a

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200

fan<00:04:26.380> of<00:04:26.530> day<00:04:26.650> two<00:04:26.710> he's<00:04:27.040> doing<00:04:27.250> pretty<00:04:27.310> much

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
fan of day two he's doing pretty much

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.750 
fan of day two he's doing pretty much
everything<00:04:27.670> in<00:04:28.090> day<00:04:28.210> two<00:04:28.270> it's<00:04:29.050> a<00:04:29.110> good<00:04:29.290> steal

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
everything in day two it's a good steal

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.790 
everything in day two it's a good steal
I<00:04:30.760> never<00:04:31.660> actually<00:04:31.810> use<00:04:32.110> it<00:04:32.230> only<00:04:32.350> because<00:04:32.710> I

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
I never actually use it only because I

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.320 
I never actually use it only because I
had<00:04:32.920> the<00:04:33.010> bag<00:04:33.160> a<00:04:33.190> bad<00:04:33.550> experience<00:04:33.910> from<00:04:34.240> the

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
had the bag a bad experience from the

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:35.970 
had the bag a bad experience from the
production<00:04:34.630> but<00:04:34.990> I<00:04:35.020> know<00:04:35.170> very<00:04:35.500> well<00:04:35.650> with

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
production but I know very well with

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.970 
production but I know very well with
that<00:04:36.160> the<00:04:36.400> production<00:04:36.850> stills<00:04:37.300> are<00:04:38.020> very<00:04:38.680> far

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
that the production stills are very far

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.000 
that the production stills are very far
away<00:04:39.220> from<00:04:39.280> the<00:04:39.640> custom<00:04:40.300> heat<00:04:40.510> treated<00:04:40.870> steel

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
away from the custom heat treated steel

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.290 
away from the custom heat treated steel
so<00:04:42.010> that's<00:04:42.250> about<00:04:42.340> the<00:04:42.520> only<00:04:42.550> reason<00:04:43.030> I<00:04:43.120> never

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300

like I know this look at the screws the
screws<00:05:25.060> that<00:05:25.180> go<00:05:25.240> through<00:05:25.660> you<00:05:25.810> know<00:05:25.840> we<00:05:26.080> have

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200 
screws that go through you know we have

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.220 
screws that go through you know we have
a<00:05:26.230> little<00:05:26.470> flathead<00:05:26.860> slider<00:05:27.460> there<00:05:28.050> it<00:05:29.050> looks

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:29.230 
a little flathead slider there it looks

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:30.690 
a little flathead slider there it looks
like<00:05:29.380> the<00:05:29.500> pocket<00:05:29.770> clip<00:05:29.860> is<00:05:30.040> removable<00:05:30.490> by

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:30.700

that little screw there and that

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.470 
that little screw there and that
probably<00:05:32.500> slides<00:05:32.800> out<00:05:33.040> and<00:05:33.250> you<00:05:34.060> can<00:05:34.270> probably

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:34.480

comparison<00:06:32.590> this<00:06:33.490> isn't<00:06:33.790> a<00:06:33.850> small<00:06:34.090> knife

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360

originally<00:06:34.930> I<00:06:34.960> thought<00:06:35.170> actually<00:06:35.410> for<00:06:35.740> some

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:35.890 
originally I thought actually for some

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:38.220 
originally I thought actually for some
reason<00:06:36.130> that's<00:06:36.220> gonna<00:06:36.400> be<00:06:36.580> smaller<00:06:36.880> knife<00:06:37.230> but

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:38.230 
reason that's gonna be smaller knife but

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.090 
reason that's gonna be smaller knife but
you<00:06:38.350> know<00:06:38.470> here<00:06:39.160> you<00:06:39.250> go<00:06:39.460> with<00:06:39.670> the<00:06:39.760> power

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:40.100 
you know here you go with the power

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.700 
you know here you go with the power
-<00:06:40.390> it's<00:06:41.390> actually<00:06:41.540> larger<00:06:42.020> than<00:06:42.260> pirata<00:06:42.650> -

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:42.710 
- it's actually larger than pirata -

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.610 
- it's actually larger than pirata -
just<00:06:42.950> slightly<00:06:43.780> no<00:06:44.780> it<00:06:44.900> is<00:06:45.020> probably<00:06:45.410> what

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:45.620 
just slightly no it is probably what

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.490 
just slightly no it is probably what
about<00:06:46.430> the<00:06:46.550> same<00:06:46.790> handle<00:06:47.270> but<00:06:48.080> a<00:06:48.110> little

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:48.500 
about the same handle but a little

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.660 
about the same handle but a little
longer<00:06:48.740> blade<00:06:49.390> just<00:06:50.390> slightly<00:06:50.780> longer<00:06:51.200> blade

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:51.670 
longer blade just slightly longer blade

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:57.250 
longer blade just slightly longer blade
and<00:06:52.810> look<00:06:53.810> at<00:06:53.930> the<00:06:54.020> thickness<00:06:55.870> you<00:06:56.870> see<00:06:57.080> this

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:57.260
