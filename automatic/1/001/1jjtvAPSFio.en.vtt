00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:07.049
 very good I had to show you today 

00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:10.110
 you remember that I told you in a last 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.120
 video that can upload is worth that left me 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.269
 a friend a hard drive those external 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.880
 which he had proceeded a coup and then 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.770
 It did not work and of course he needed me 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.630
 a computer with tickets to is for 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.119
 power like being sata connection to be able 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.480
 look at it then what I 'm going to teach you 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.400
 I today is worth my friend who has left me 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.109
 his computer around he had makes 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.380
 time stopped but it takes tickets 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.540
 until then I was worth it but of course for 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.670
 get fix my hard drive 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.260
 friend had to fix the computer 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.690
 of the technician who lit it well 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.670
 When I received it, I got it started 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.460
 it was just as I plugged the light I gave the 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.200
 button and it went on OK but after a while 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.120
 when he returned again to turn it on and 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.760
 he would start screeching and beep 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.950
 was usually a fault that is left 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.920
 the ram that does not connect well or whatever 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.030
 I imagine that if you fail the ram and apart 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.520
 he told me that his hard drive failed 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.040
 it also has to be that the plate does not 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.800
 it was very good 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.900
 but good what lasted lasted the 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.270
 I'm going to show you a little bit what 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.130
 what have I done to get it 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:16.760
 turn on the computer and it will work 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.320
 and good if you realize here is the 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.600
 hard disk that what interested me was 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.790
 what 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.350
 had the esata connections that is the 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.570
 cable cited this that goes up there to the 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:30.659
 fund is worth carrying its four connections 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.840
 and what that failure gives me was because 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.240
 grab 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.310
 if you notice it, it was connected before 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.590
 that to the left 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.070
 I've been testing in the reds but the 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.170
 reds did not give a nothing was still 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.220
 Then, what I have done has 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.780
 been changing it to the right is worth if 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.850
 we have these two yellow ports 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.039
 the port on the right and well then 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.649
 you see a lesser average cited that is 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:00.470
 pretty well I think it's from 2006 but 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:05.600
 good does its function entails these 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:09.220
 prehistoric cables as you will see and in 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.220
 end in theory now 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.260
 normal power beep 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.069
 and the computer 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.069
 with life 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.860
 I'll continue 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.980
 ending with the computer worth 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:33.269
 it is simply configuring the wifi and 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.650
 that and I comment to you I teach you what is the 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.540
 Welcome hard drive to see if 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.239
 with him 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.890
 recover the information first that's 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:44.250
 what I see more important to get 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:48.210
 recover the information you know 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.820
 with everything I 've done I also accepted 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:53.820
 of course it is rather I learn 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.370
 and why do we all talk a little bit 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.620
 tell me you too suggestions or 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.310
 what would you do or like for example now 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.530
 what I did to change the slot 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.030
 ram memory because maybe it arrives and 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.910
 you tell me hey, well, if you did 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.310
 this would be better or hard disk joint 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.930
 of my friend if you said hear of this 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.720
 way you will get all the 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.910
 information worth anything I 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.450
 I hope you tell me in the 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.040
 comments 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.040
 I will continue until later
