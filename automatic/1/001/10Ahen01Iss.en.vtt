 In the case of Delhi , real-time coaching 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.769
 Let's take a look at what it does . 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.950

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:33.770
 I can see the options on the right basically my goal is distance to time calories 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:36.690
 You can do this , but instead of setting this goal 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:40.160
 If you check your coaching, 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.160
 Oh 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:50.190
 So you can get an athletic coach that is offered in 1st beat by time 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.210

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.949

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.160
 U 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.700

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:09.700
 As soon as you start running, you start measuring your heart rate. 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.530
 order 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.870
 This is a variation of the Asmodians. 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.600
 When you start doing this 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:29.470
 Now press the music button on the right 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:33.570
 The Lotus language can come in, or in the case of the two-gates , 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:35.570
 You can play the music right away 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.570

 Jesus geico 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:03.210
 Something like that 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:08.130
 I'll get to know more penises these days when you get a little faster. 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:11.070
 The guide comes toughness me to speed up or slow down regulation 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.910
 It's easy to come home with your wrist 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.910
 I can receive notifications 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:22.160
 Der speed is reduced 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.160
