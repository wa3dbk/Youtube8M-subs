be<00:04:51.740> the<00:04:51.919> next<00:04:52.160> iPhone<00:04:52.550> I<00:04:52.580> mean<00:04:52.820> I<00:04:52.850> guess<00:04:52.970> we'll

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
be the next iPhone I mean I guess we'll

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.520 
be the next iPhone I mean I guess we'll
find<00:04:53.240> out<00:04:53.360> pretty<00:04:53.600> soon<00:04:53.840> and<00:04:54.110> I<00:04:54.140> mean<00:04:54.290> even<00:04:54.440> if

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
find out pretty soon and I mean even if

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:55.690 
find out pretty soon and I mean even if
it's<00:04:54.620> not<00:04:54.710> the<00:04:54.830> next<00:04:55.070> one<00:04:55.190> it<00:04:55.280> can<00:04:55.370> be<00:04:55.430> like<00:04:55.580> you

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
it's not the next one it can be like you

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:56.800 
it's not the next one it can be like you
could<00:04:55.820> buy<00:04:55.910> two<00:04:56.030> or<00:04:56.120> three<00:04:56.270> down<00:04:56.570> the<00:04:56.690> line

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
could buy two or three down the line

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:57.969 
could buy two or three down the line
we'll<00:04:56.960> just<00:04:57.080> have<00:04:57.169> to<00:04:57.260> keep<00:04:57.380> speculating

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 
we'll just have to keep speculating

00:04:57.979 --> 00:04:59.409 
we'll just have to keep speculating
about<00:04:58.100> it<00:04:58.280> probably<00:04:58.640> until<00:04:58.910> the<00:04:59.000> end<00:04:59.150> of<00:04:59.270> time

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
about it probably until the end of time

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:01.930 
about it probably until the end of time
unless<00:04:59.780> it<00:05:00.260> actually<00:05:00.320> is<00:05:00.979> the<00:05:01.460> next<00:05:01.700> one<00:05:01.850> in

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
unless it actually is the next one in

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.430 
unless it actually is the next one in
which<00:05:02.030> case<00:05:02.210> that<00:05:02.330> will<00:05:02.479> be<00:05:02.510> awesome

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
which case that will be awesome

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.890
