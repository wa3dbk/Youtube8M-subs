separately from the camera for the first
time<00:00:07.770> ever<00:00:08.040> I'm<00:00:08.780> using<00:00:09.780> a<00:00:10.260> zoom<00:00:10.559> h4n<00:00:10.889> and<00:00:12.469> I'm

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
time ever I'm using a zoom h4n and I'm

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:21.290 
time ever I'm using a zoom h4n and I'm
using<00:00:13.920> a<00:00:14.370> Canon<00:00:14.790> 70d<00:00:15.379> to<00:00:16.379> film<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:17.550> video<00:00:19.910> so<00:00:20.910> I

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
using a Canon 70d to film the video so I

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.870 
using a Canon 70d to film the video so I
bought<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.380> zoom<00:00:22.560> it<00:00:22.980> was<00:00:23.490> about<00:00:24.260> 180<00:00:25.260> pounds

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
bought the zoom it was about 180 pounds

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.960 
bought the zoom it was about 180 pounds
and<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:27.500> think<00:00:28.500> it's<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:29.010> good<00:00:29.189> piece<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.519> kit<00:00:29.699> I

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
and I think it's a good piece of kit I

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.269 
and I think it's a good piece of kit I
think<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:31.109> works<00:00:31.380> very<00:00:31.619> well<00:00:31.710> with<00:00:32.040> people

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
think it works very well with people

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.020 
think it works very well with people
filming<00:00:32.850> on<00:00:32.969> DSLRs<00:00:34.520> because<00:00:35.520> we<00:00:35.640> all<00:00:35.790> know

good for for what I want to do so I

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.980 
good for for what I want to do so I
invested<00:01:33.960> in<00:01:34.220> separate<00:01:35.220> sound<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.780> great

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
invested in separate sound and the great

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.649 
invested in separate sound and the great
thing<00:01:37.200> about<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.500> zoom<00:01:37.740> h4n<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:39.000> can<00:01:39.240> you

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
thing about the zoom h4n is you can you

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.530 
thing about the zoom h4n is you can you
can<00:01:39.840> plug<00:01:40.049> in<00:01:40.229> quite<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.740> couple<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.189> different

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
can plug in quite a couple of different

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.389 
can plug in quite a couple of different
microphones<00:01:42.540> it's<00:01:43.350> got<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.530> built-in<00:01:43.890> phantom

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
microphones it's got a built-in phantom

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.389 
microphones it's got a built-in phantom
power<00:01:45.950> and<00:01:47.540> it's<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.960> good<00:01:49.530> piece<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.920> kit<00:01:50.100> quite

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
power and it's a good piece of kit quite

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.160 
power and it's a good piece of kit quite
durable<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.970> can<00:01:51.119> drop<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.840> think<00:01:51.899> it's

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
durable you can drop it and I think it's

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.760 
durable you can drop it and I think it's
the<00:01:52.320> works<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:54.799> so<00:01:55.799> yeah<00:01:56.040> so<00:01:56.250> I'm<00:01:56.729> basically

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
the works and so yeah so I'm basically

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.980 
the works and so yeah so I'm basically
I've<00:01:58.770> got<00:01:58.829> them<00:01:59.100> got<00:01:59.790> them<00:01:59.969> set<00:02:00.240> up<00:02:00.270> separately

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
I've got them got them set up separately

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.740 
I've got them got them set up separately
at<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.200> moment<00:02:01.700> but<00:02:02.700> what<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.000> can<00:02:03.240> do<00:02:03.509> is

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
at the moment but what you can do is

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.410 
at the moment but what you can do is
there's<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.619> good<00:02:04.770> option<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.399> can<00:02:05.579> get<00:02:06.390> a

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
there's a good option you can get a

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:13.309 
there's a good option you can get a
splitter<00:02:07.550> to<00:02:08.550> plug<00:02:09.000> your<00:02:09.959> earphones<00:02:11.150> and

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
splitter to plug your earphones and

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.830 
splitter to plug your earphones and
one<00:02:14.319> lead<00:02:14.560> to<00:02:14.709> going<00:02:14.920> into<00:02:15.069> yeah<00:02:15.610> yeah<00:02:15.970> yeah

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
one lead to going into yeah yeah yeah

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
one lead to going into yeah yeah yeah
DSLR<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:19.000> thing<00:02:19.209> about<00:02:19.420> the<00:02:19.599> 70d<00:02:20.230> is<00:02:20.560> it

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
DSLR the thing about the 70d is it

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.100 
DSLR the thing about the 70d is it
doesn't<00:02:21.069> have<00:02:21.510> a<00:02:22.510> now<00:02:23.410> for<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.099> earphones<00:02:25.110> but

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
doesn't have a now for the earphones but

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.830 
doesn't have a now for the earphones but
with<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.440> h4n<00:02:27.430> you<00:02:27.640> can<00:02:27.879> you<00:02:28.180> can<00:02:28.360> get<00:02:28.540> just<00:02:28.750> a

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
with the h4n you can you can get just a

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.960 
with the h4n you can you can get just a
splitter<00:02:29.140> you<00:02:29.440> can<00:02:29.920> get<00:02:30.069> them<00:02:30.190> from<00:02:30.430> I<00:02:30.760> think

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
splitter you can get them from I think

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.509 
splitter you can get them from I think
you<00:02:31.030> can<00:02:31.120> get<00:02:31.239> it<00:02:31.360> from<00:02:31.540> their<00:02:31.720> website<00:02:32.519> and

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
you can get it from their website and

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
the zoom that goes straight into the

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.630 
the zoom that goes straight into the
footage<00:02:39.280> on<00:02:39.549> you<00:02:39.879> you<00:02:40.450> DSLR<00:02:41.110> and<00:02:42.069> you<00:02:42.310> can<00:02:42.459> also

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
footage on you you DSLR and you can also

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.309 
footage on you you DSLR and you can also
listen<00:02:42.940> to<00:02:43.269> it<00:02:43.420> through<00:02:43.599> through<00:02:44.049> earphones

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
listen to it through through earphones

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.400 
listen to it through through earphones
to<00:02:45.040> make<00:02:45.220> sure<00:02:45.430> that<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:46.480> audio<00:02:46.870> quality<00:02:47.079> is

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
to make sure that the audio quality is

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.940 
to make sure that the audio quality is
is<00:02:47.890> at<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.250> right<00:02:48.430> levels<00:02:48.819> and<00:02:49.030> stuff<00:02:49.269> so<00:02:49.569> I

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
is at the right levels and stuff so I

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.259 
is at the right levels and stuff so I
think<00:02:50.950> they<00:02:51.220> both<00:02:51.400> work<00:02:51.670> very<00:02:51.910> well<00:02:51.970> together

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
think they both work very well together

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.640 
think they both work very well together
and<00:02:54.060> I'll<00:02:55.060> do<00:02:55.269> a<00:02:55.299> test<00:02:55.660> right<00:02:55.900> now<00:02:55.930> this<00:02:56.349> this

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
and I'll do a test right now this this

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.550 
and I'll do a test right now this this
right<00:02:57.040> here<00:02:57.099> is<00:02:57.640> the<00:02:58.629> sound<00:02:58.900> quality<00:02:59.319> again

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
right here is the sound quality again

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.970 
right here is the sound quality again
from<00:02:59.739> the<00:02:59.829> DSLR<00:03:00.310> and<00:03:00.940> as<00:03:01.120> you<00:03:01.329> can<00:03:01.590> tell<00:03:02.590> it's

from the DSLR and as you can tell it's

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.900 
from the DSLR and as you can tell it's
very<00:03:03.129> tinny<00:03:04.470> if<00:03:05.470> there's<00:03:05.799> no<00:03:05.980> there's<00:03:06.459> no<00:03:06.519> bass

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
very tinny if there's no there's no bass

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.410 
very tinny if there's no there's no bass
at<00:03:07.150> all<00:03:07.360> and<00:03:07.810> it<00:03:08.079> it's<00:03:08.530> not<00:03:08.860> a<00:03:08.890> nice<00:03:09.160> sound<00:03:09.549> it's

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
at all and it it's not a nice sound it's

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.660 
at all and it it's not a nice sound it's
not<00:03:10.540> bad<00:03:11.819> but<00:03:12.819> it's<00:03:13.030> for<00:03:13.510> you<00:03:13.660> know<00:03:13.780> for<00:03:14.049> doing

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
not bad but it's for you know for doing

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:21.030 
not bad but it's for you know for doing
video<00:03:16.319> it's<00:03:17.319> it<00:03:18.160> needs<00:03:18.430> to<00:03:18.609> be<00:03:18.760> better<00:03:19.590> so<00:03:20.590> and

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
video it's it needs to be better so and

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.110 
video it's it needs to be better so and
now<00:03:21.340> we<00:03:21.400> switch<00:03:21.700> back<00:03:21.910> to<00:03:21.970> the<00:03:23.250> h4n<00:03:24.250> and<00:03:24.519> you

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
now we switch back to the h4n and you

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.020 
now we switch back to the h4n and you
can<00:03:25.299> tell<00:03:25.540> there's<00:03:26.109> an<00:03:26.350> instant<00:03:27.190> improvement

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
can tell there's an instant improvement

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.650 
can tell there's an instant improvement
on<00:03:28.590> other<00:03:29.590> than<00:03:30.010> the<00:03:30.190> sound<00:03:30.760> that<00:03:31.000> you<00:03:31.450> get

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
on other than the sound that you get

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.910
