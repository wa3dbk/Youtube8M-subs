00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
that so let's work with it a minute here

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.990 
that so let's work with it a minute here
I'll<00:02:05.619> go<00:02:05.829> around<00:02:05.979> here<00:02:06.250> make<00:02:06.429> it<00:02:06.549> a<00:02:06.609> little<00:02:06.759> bit

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
I'll go around here make it a little bit

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.869 
I'll go around here make it a little bit
deeper<00:02:07.619> that<00:02:08.619> way<00:02:08.799> you<00:02:08.860> all<00:02:09.160> can<00:02:09.190> get<00:02:09.459> an<00:02:09.549> idea

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:09.879 
deeper that way you all can get an idea

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:16.440 
deeper that way you all can get an idea
of<00:02:09.940> what<00:02:10.149> I'm<00:02:10.239> trying<00:02:10.509> to<00:02:10.569> convey<00:02:15.420> okay<00:02:16.420> I

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
of what I'm trying to convey okay I

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.119 
of what I'm trying to convey okay I
think<00:02:16.660> that's<00:02:17.019> going<00:02:17.170> to<00:02:17.230> be<00:02:17.290> deep<00:02:17.680> enough<00:02:17.830> to

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
think that's going to be deep enough to

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:24.970 
think that's going to be deep enough to
suit<00:02:18.400> our<00:02:18.580> purposes

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.000 

now<00:02:25.730> it<00:02:26.690> looks<00:02:26.930> like<00:02:27.110> if<00:02:27.260> we<00:02:27.290> wanted<00:02:27.709> to<00:02:27.890> we

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
now it looks like if we wanted to we

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.380 
now it looks like if we wanted to we
could<00:02:28.069> have<00:02:28.310> a<00:02:28.340> little<00:02:28.580> bit<00:02:28.700> of<00:02:28.910> a<00:02:29.000> fluid

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
could have a little bit of a fluid

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.259 
could have a little bit of a fluid
coming<00:02:29.629> up<00:02:29.810> here<00:02:29.989> and<00:02:30.110> running<00:02:30.260> down<00:02:30.560> this

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
coming up here and running down this

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.479 
coming up here and running down this
little<00:02:32.269> indention<00:02:32.599> that<00:02:32.870> I've<00:02:33.019> made<00:02:33.230> here

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
little indention that I've made here

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.210 
little indention that I've made here
okay<00:02:35.080> that's<00:02:36.080> just<00:02:36.140> an<00:02:36.319> idea<00:02:36.620> this<00:02:36.890> is<00:02:36.950> what<00:02:37.099> I

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
okay that's just an idea this is what I

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.040 
okay that's just an idea this is what I
was<00:02:37.400> gonna<00:02:37.580> go<00:02:37.819> with<00:02:37.849> but<00:02:38.480> this<00:02:38.660> is<00:02:38.780> just<00:02:38.959> a

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
was gonna go with but this is just a

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.240 
was gonna go with but this is just a
quick<00:02:39.170> example<00:02:39.530> so<00:02:39.739> I'm<00:02:39.800> just<00:02:39.920> gonna<00:02:40.010> show<00:02:40.220> you

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
quick example so I'm just gonna show you

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.559 
quick example so I'm just gonna show you
how<00:02:40.370> to<00:02:40.400> use<00:02:40.610> this<00:02:40.760> tool<00:02:41.000> instead<00:02:41.209> of<00:02:41.330> showing

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
how to use this tool instead of showing

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.000 
how to use this tool instead of showing
you<00:02:41.690> how<00:02:41.810> to<00:02:41.870> animate<00:02:42.200> part<00:02:42.620> you<00:02:42.769> know<00:02:42.860> this

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
you how to animate part you know this

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.290 
you how to animate part you know this
fluid<00:02:43.310> and<00:02:43.430> stuff<00:02:43.550> because<00:02:43.760> it<00:02:43.849> just<00:02:44.000> take<00:02:44.150> too

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
fluid and stuff because it just take too

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.440 
fluid and stuff because it just take too
long<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.950> objective<00:02:46.489> of<00:02:46.550> this<00:02:46.670> is<00:02:46.910> the<00:02:47.120> sculpt

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
long the objective of this is the sculpt

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.420 
long the objective of this is the sculpt
tool<00:02:47.630> so<00:02:47.930> we've<00:02:48.200> used<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:48.590> sculpt<00:02:48.980> tool<00:02:49.190> now

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
tool so we've used the sculpt tool now

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.400 
tool so we've used the sculpt tool now
we<00:02:49.730> need<00:02:49.910> to<00:02:50.150> I<00:02:50.630> need<00:02:50.750> to<00:02:50.810> show<00:02:50.989> you<00:02:51.080> how<00:02:51.170> to<00:02:51.230> use

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
we need to I need to show you how to use

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.289 
we need to I need to show you how to use
the<00:02:51.560> sculpt<00:02:51.860> particles<00:02:52.370> tool<00:02:52.580> but<00:02:53.000> we<00:02:53.090> can't

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
the sculpt particles tool but we can't

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.350 
the sculpt particles tool but we can't
use<00:02:53.450> this<00:02:53.599> gold<00:02:53.870> particles<00:02:54.290> tool<00:02:54.470> until<00:02:54.650> we

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
use this gold particles tool until we

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.120 
use this gold particles tool until we
have<00:02:56.360> some<00:02:56.540> particles<00:02:57.049> some<00:02:57.470> fluid<00:02:57.830> sculpt

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
have some particles some fluid sculpt

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.880 
have some particles some fluid sculpt
fluids<00:02:58.459> so<00:02:59.269> what<00:02:59.569> we're<00:02:59.690> gonna<00:02:59.810> do<00:03:00.019> is<00:03:00.170> I'm

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
fluids so what we're gonna do is I'm

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.160 
fluids so what we're gonna do is I'm
going<00:03:01.040> to<00:03:01.099> ctrl<00:03:01.400> click<00:03:01.549> another<00:03:01.819> grid<00:03:02.090> and<00:03:02.450> lay

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
going to ctrl click another grid and lay

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.170 
going to ctrl click another grid and lay
down<00:03:03.319> another<00:03:03.440> grid<00:03:03.769> on<00:03:03.890> top<00:03:03.920> of<00:03:04.220> it<00:03:04.340> okay<00:03:04.519> now

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
down another grid on top of it okay now

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.039 
down another grid on top of it okay now
you<00:03:05.239> can<00:03:05.420> see<00:03:05.810> what<00:03:06.230> we<00:03:06.349> got<00:03:06.500> going<00:03:06.799> on<00:03:06.860> here

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
would select that now and hit return but

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.970 
would select that now and hit return but
since<00:03:56.150> we<00:03:56.239> don't<00:03:56.329> have<00:03:56.450> any<00:03:56.650> obstacle<00:03:57.650> objects

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
since we don't have any obstacle objects

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.020 
since we don't have any obstacle objects
I'm<00:03:58.160> just<00:03:58.280> gonna<00:03:58.430> go<00:03:58.549> ahead<00:03:58.609> and<00:03:58.700> hit<00:03:58.850> hit

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
I'm just gonna go ahead and hit hit

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.120 
I'm just gonna go ahead and hit hit
return<00:03:59.269> without<00:03:59.480> selecting<00:03:59.870> anything<00:04:00.230> and

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
return without selecting anything and

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.379 
return without selecting anything and
when<00:04:01.220> I<00:04:01.280> do<00:04:01.340> this<00:04:01.579> it's<00:04:01.790> gonna<00:04:01.880> cook<00:04:02.120> for<00:04:02.180> a

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:02.389 
when I do this it's gonna cook for a

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:03.550 
when I do this it's gonna cook for a
minute<00:04:02.630> and<00:04:02.720> it's<00:04:03.109> gonna<00:04:03.200> give<00:04:03.410> me<00:04:03.440> some

and there we go now as you can see give

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:16.640 
and there we go now as you can see give
me<00:04:12.750> some<00:04:12.930> fluids<00:04:13.409> inside<00:04:14.329> where<00:04:15.329> I<00:04:15.659> sculpt<00:04:16.500> it

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
me some fluids inside where I sculpt it

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.259 
me some fluids inside where I sculpt it
okay<00:04:17.430> and<00:04:17.699> if<00:04:18.359> I<00:04:18.449> hit<00:04:18.630> play<00:04:18.810> you'll<00:04:19.709> see<00:04:20.269> it

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
okay and if I hit play you'll see it

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.490 
okay and if I hit play you'll see it
falls<00:04:21.539> down<00:04:21.660> in<00:04:21.900> there<00:04:22.049> like<00:04:22.199> that<00:04:22.229> I<00:04:24.410> mean<00:04:25.410> you

up to particle separation and you can
take<00:04:40.500> that<00:04:40.680> down<00:04:40.919> I'm<00:04:41.190> going<00:04:41.340> to<00:04:41.400> take<00:04:41.490> it<00:04:41.610> to

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
take that down I'm going to take it to

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:43.070 
take that down I'm going to take it to
zero<00:04:41.910> point<00:04:42.180> two<00:04:42.300> you<00:04:42.419> don't<00:04:42.570> want<00:04:42.690> to<00:04:42.780> get<00:04:42.900> too

zero point two you don't want to get too

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.840 
zero point two you don't want to get too
low<00:04:43.260> because<00:04:43.410> it<00:04:43.680> will<00:04:43.770> take<00:04:43.949> forever<00:04:44.160> it's

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
low because it will take forever it's

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.080 
low because it will take forever it's
gonna<00:04:45.000> make<00:04:45.150> it<00:04:45.240> about<00:04:45.419> point<00:04:45.960> two<00:04:46.139> hit<00:04:46.800> return

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
gonna make it about point two hit return

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:53.000 
gonna make it about point two hit return
let's<00:04:48.090> go<00:04:48.150> back<00:04:48.300> up<00:04:48.419> to<00:04:48.449> object<00:04:48.630> level<00:04:51.889> if<00:04:52.889> you

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
let's go back up to object level if you

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.200 
let's go back up to object level if you
go<00:04:53.160> into<00:04:53.490> your<00:04:53.729> sculpting<00:04:54.419> fluid<00:04:55.850> now<00:04:56.850> because

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
go into your sculpting fluid now because

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.360 
go into your sculpting fluid now because
we<00:04:57.360> have<00:04:57.479> this<00:04:57.660> visualized<00:04:58.229> we<00:04:58.800> can<00:04:58.949> go<00:04:59.070> in<00:04:59.220> and

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
we have this visualized we can go in and

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.430 
we have this visualized we can go in and
increase<00:04:59.669> our<00:04:59.789> surface<00:05:00.180> distance<00:05:00.630> and<00:05:00.840> you

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
increase our surface distance and you

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.580 
increase our surface distance and you
can<00:05:01.470> see<00:05:01.830> how<00:05:02.669> that's<00:05:02.880> affecting<00:05:03.389> our<00:05:03.590> our

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
can see how that's affecting our our

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:11.629 
can see how that's affecting our our
scene<00:05:05.960> you<00:05:06.960> can<00:05:07.110> up<00:05:07.349> it<00:05:07.530> way<00:05:07.710> up<00:05:10.250> or<00:05:11.250> you<00:05:11.520> can

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639 
scene you can up it way up or you can

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:13.939 
scene you can up it way up or you can
take<00:05:11.789> it<00:05:11.910> way<00:05:12.030> down<00:05:12.240> it's<00:05:13.229> really<00:05:13.440> up<00:05:13.680> to<00:05:13.710> you

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:13.949 
take it way down it's really up to you

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:15.469 
take it way down it's really up to you
you<00:05:14.220> need<00:05:14.340> to<00:05:14.400> go<00:05:14.610> in<00:05:14.729> and<00:05:14.849> finesse<00:05:15.120> it<00:05:15.300> how<00:05:15.419> you

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 
you need to go in and finesse it how you

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:17.689 
you need to go in and finesse it how you
see<00:05:15.599> fit<00:05:15.990> but<00:05:16.919> there<00:05:17.130> you<00:05:17.220> go<00:05:17.280> that's<00:05:17.370> the

sculpt particle nodes hope you learned

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.930 
sculpt particle nodes hope you learned
something

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
something

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.870
