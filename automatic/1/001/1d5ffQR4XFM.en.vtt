00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:15.730
 I am Samuel felt the pressure on 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:20.680
 Funk Hydroponics can launch the iphone 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:24.300
 through the native plant shot today 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:28.289
 was held the 4th national conference 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.289
 child by ticket 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:38.879
 this process mobilized the entire school 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:42.850
 where can we pray 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:46.649
 where the students will present their dreams 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:50.289
 and were lifted over the two months 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:54.249
 These dreams culminated in a 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:57.280
 tree to revisions and was made of the students 

00:00:54.249 --> 00:00:59.829
 and with the purpose of showing the dreams 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.739
 together with your paths and the 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:05.100
 utensils that were the stones a dream 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:08.850
 what were made of the students 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.030
 years in case they are the ones who use flowers 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.490
 and focused on the cups below have the 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.610
 paths that is how we 'll get to 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.009
 these and then down there and 12 stones 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.590
 would be the problems we see that 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.060
 I committed no error along the way 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.979
 found 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.830
 we saw that the conference could 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.360
 gain greater proportions and all 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.729
 students were involved 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.039
 it was the moment when it stops growing 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.840
 the possible paths we can take 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:39.179
 to make my school better 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.310
 so I guess from that they 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:43.560
 working together we will help 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.159
 achieve our goal and understand each other 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.200
 very well and they feel it is a part 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.819
 of me is collaborating so that the 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.550
 process happens so this is very 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:56.310
 important integrated and another reality and 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.530
 know that everyone has the same cause 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.460
 make public policies happen 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.460
 sustainable way
