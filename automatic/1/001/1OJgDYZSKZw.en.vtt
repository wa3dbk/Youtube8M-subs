pad<00:01:20.990> a<00:01:23.560> little<00:01:24.560> trick<00:01:24.860> I've<00:01:25.010> learnt<00:01:25.220> actually

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
pad a little trick I've learnt actually

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.020 
pad a little trick I've learnt actually
is<00:01:25.970> if<00:01:26.480> your<00:01:26.630> glue<00:01:26.870> starts<00:01:27.560> to<00:01:27.880> get<00:01:28.880> a<00:01:28.910> little

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
is if your glue starts to get a little

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.610 
is if your glue starts to get a little
bit<00:01:29.210> around<00:01:29.300> the<00:01:29.420> outside<00:01:29.870> and<00:01:30.170> get<00:01:30.410> stuck

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
bit around the outside and get stuck

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.830 
bit around the outside and get stuck
together<00:01:30.800> drop<00:01:31.610> a<00:01:31.640> bit<00:01:31.850> of<00:01:31.880> cellular<00:01:32.210> oil<00:01:32.390> just

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
together drop a bit of cellular oil just

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.960 
together drop a bit of cellular oil just
on<00:01:33.020> the<00:01:33.110> neck<00:01:33.260> and<00:01:33.890> close<00:01:34.190> up<00:01:34.430> again<00:01:34.700> and<00:01:34.880> you

roughly<00:01:53.540> where<00:01:54.500> you're<00:01:54.620> going<00:01:54.800> to<00:01:54.920> be<00:01:55.010> doing

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
roughly where you're going to be doing

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.860 
roughly where you're going to be doing
it<00:01:55.400> now<00:01:56.060> you<00:01:56.150> don't<00:01:56.270> want<00:01:56.390> to<00:01:56.450> apply<00:01:56.570> too<00:01:56.660> much

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:56.870 
it now you don't want to apply too much

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.570 
it now you don't want to apply too much
at<00:01:57.140> a<00:01:57.170> time<00:01:57.200> here<00:01:57.710> because<00:01:58.370> it<00:01:58.730> does<00:01:59.150> set<00:02:00.580> not

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
at a time here because it does set not

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.550 
at a time here because it does set not
relatively<00:02:02.150> quickly<00:02:02.360> as<00:02:02.630> it<00:02:02.780> is<00:02:02.900> the<00:02:03.080> gel<00:02:03.290> bond

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
relatively quickly as it is the gel bond

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.840 
relatively quickly as it is the gel bond
you've<00:02:03.800> got<00:02:03.950> a<00:02:03.980> bit<00:02:04.130> of<00:02:04.160> time<00:02:04.280> to<00:02:04.490> play<00:02:04.640> with<00:02:04.670> it

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
you've got a bit of time to play with it

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.729 
you've got a bit of time to play with it
what<00:02:05.780> I<00:02:05.810> have<00:02:06.020> over<00:02:06.170> here<00:02:06.500> is<00:02:06.970> I<00:02:07.970> have<00:02:08.090> got<00:02:08.330> some

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
what I have over here is I have got some

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.649 
Shroff's key elements there DOB crystals
I've<00:02:12.349> got<00:02:12.739> them<00:02:12.950> in<00:02:13.310> size<00:02:14.620> SS<00:02:15.620> v<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:16.790> SS<00:02:17.239> right

to order in the SS 3 especially because

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.820 
to order in the SS 3 especially because
it's<00:02:21.830> quite<00:02:22.010> unusual<00:02:22.130> to<00:02:22.460> go<00:02:22.550> that<00:02:22.700> small

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
the pencil I'm using here again it's

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.370 
the pencil I'm using here again it's
just<00:02:25.990> off<00:02:26.290> eBay<00:02:26.710> and<00:02:27.660> it's<00:02:28.660> just<00:02:28.840> a<00:02:28.930> gem<00:02:29.140> cut

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380

think<00:02:32.260> about<00:02:32.380> the<00:02:32.620> design<00:02:32.920> you<00:02:33.070> want<00:02:33.160> to<00:02:33.340> do<00:02:33.490> I

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
think about the design you want to do I

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.460 
think about the design you want to do I
am<00:02:34.180> just<00:02:34.390> gonna<00:02:34.510> see<00:02:34.780> where<00:02:34.960> we<00:02:35.080> go<00:02:35.200> with<00:02:35.350> this

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
am just gonna see where we go with this

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.040 
am just gonna see where we go with this
one<00:02:35.910> but<00:02:36.910> you<00:02:36.940> just<00:02:37.210> pick<00:02:37.390> up<00:02:37.480> your<00:02:37.540> crystals

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
one but you just pick up your crystals

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.200 
one but you just pick up your crystals
and<00:02:38.500> pop<00:02:38.740> them<00:02:38.980> onto<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.700> gel<00:02:39.910> bond<00:02:42.090> if<00:02:43.090> you

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
and pop them onto the gel bond if you

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:48.420 
and pop them onto the gel bond if you
need<00:02:43.330> a<00:02:43.360> bit<00:02:43.570> more<00:02:43.720> gel<00:02:43.930> bond<00:02:44.170> go<00:02:44.410> ahead<00:02:47.430> do

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
need a bit more gel bond go ahead do

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.280 
need a bit more gel bond go ahead do
give<00:02:48.610> them<00:02:48.700> a<00:02:48.820> pat-down<00:02:49.030> as<00:02:49.540> well<00:02:49.750> you<00:02:50.170> don't

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
give them a pat-down as well you don't

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.750 
give them a pat-down as well you don't
want<00:02:50.470> them<00:02:50.560> sliding<00:02:50.830> around<00:02:51.070> all<00:02:51.460> over<00:02:51.490> the

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
want them sliding around all over the

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.290 
want them sliding around all over the
place<00:02:53.220> what's<00:02:54.220> quite<00:02:54.430> good<00:02:54.610> is<00:02:54.730> if<00:02:54.850> you<00:02:54.940> do<00:02:55.060> get

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
place what's quite good is if you do get

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.140 
place what's quite good is if you do get
any<00:02:55.480> of<00:02:56.020> the<00:02:56.560> white<00:02:56.710> from<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.070> pencil<00:02:57.490> on<00:02:57.670> the

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
any of the white from the pencil on the

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.700 
any of the white from the pencil on the
crystals<00:02:58.570> once<00:02:58.780> they're<00:02:59.020> set<00:02:59.200> wipes<00:02:59.530> off

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
crystals once they're set wipes off

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:00.810 
crystals once they're set wipes off
really<00:02:59.950> quickly<00:03:00.160> with<00:03:00.430> a<00:03:00.460> little<00:03:00.670> bit<00:03:00.790> of

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
really quickly with a little bit of

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.820 
really quickly with a little bit of
isopropyl<00:03:01.420> alcohol<00:03:01.480> now<00:03:02.020> this<00:03:02.200> design<00:03:02.500> I'm

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
isopropyl alcohol now this design I'm

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.560 
isopropyl alcohol now this design I'm
doing<00:03:03.040> here<00:03:03.250> is<00:03:03.370> sort<00:03:03.580> of<00:03:03.640> just<00:03:03.820> a<00:03:03.970> derivative

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
doing here is sort of just a derivative

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.330 
doing here is sort of just a derivative
of<00:03:04.720> one<00:03:04.870> that's<00:03:05.050> very<00:03:05.500> popular<00:03:05.800> with<00:03:06.070> a<00:03:06.190> lot<00:03:06.310> of

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
of one that's very popular with a lot of

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.950 
of one that's very popular with a lot of
my<00:03:06.490> clients<00:03:06.940> they<00:03:07.090> tend<00:03:07.270> to<00:03:07.360> have<00:03:07.510> this<00:03:07.690> on<00:03:07.870> the

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960 
my clients they tend to have this on the

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.830 
my clients they tend to have this on the
ring<00:03:08.110> finger<00:03:08.530> and<00:03:09.360> sometimes<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:10.510> thumb<00:03:10.690> as

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
ring finger and sometimes the thumb as

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.130 
ring finger and sometimes the thumb as
well<00:03:10.870> but<00:03:11.830> you<00:03:11.920> can<00:03:12.070> do<00:03:12.160> any<00:03:12.310> design<00:03:12.640> you<00:03:12.670> like

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
well but you can do any design you like

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.540 
well but you can do any design you like
one<00:03:14.140> of<00:03:14.200> my<00:03:14.290> most<00:03:14.320> recent<00:03:14.650> ones<00:03:14.980> was<00:03:15.070> a<00:03:15.220> treble

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
one of my most recent ones was a treble

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.150 
one of my most recent ones was a treble
clef<00:03:15.670> for<00:03:16.540> a<00:03:16.570> client<00:03:16.870> and<00:03:17.290> that<00:03:17.710> turned<00:03:18.010> out

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
clef for a client and that turned out

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.500 
clef for a client and that turned out
really<00:03:18.190> really<00:03:18.520> well<00:03:18.700> that<00:03:18.970> was<00:03:19.060> a<00:03:19.090> lovely<00:03:19.240> one

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
really really well that was a lovely one

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.950 
really really well that was a lovely one
that<00:03:19.690> one<00:03:20.820> so<00:03:21.820> here's<00:03:22.120> the<00:03:22.390> finished<00:03:22.660> design

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:22.960 
that one so here's the finished design

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.590 
that one so here's the finished design
all<00:03:23.440> I've<00:03:23.680> done<00:03:23.830> here<00:03:23.890> as<00:03:24.310> I<00:03:24.460> just<00:03:25.180> applied<00:03:25.570> the

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
all I've done here as I just applied the

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.760 
all I've done here as I just applied the
glue<00:03:25.780> wherever<00:03:26.230> I<00:03:26.260> wanted<00:03:26.530> to<00:03:26.590> put<00:03:26.680> the

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
glue wherever I wanted to put the

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.410 
glue wherever I wanted to put the
crystals<00:03:27.190> just<00:03:27.460> sort<00:03:27.610> of<00:03:27.640> a<00:03:27.760> sweeping<00:03:28.150> design

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
crystals just sort of a sweeping design

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.880 
crystals just sort of a sweeping design
you<00:03:28.600> can<00:03:28.720> do<00:03:28.870> this<00:03:29.050> at<00:03:29.200> the<00:03:29.290> base<00:03:29.470> of<00:03:29.680> the<00:03:29.740> nail

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
you can do this at the base of the nail

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.920 
you can do this at the base of the nail
and<00:03:30.130> the<00:03:30.580> tip<00:03:30.790> or<00:03:30.970> anything<00:03:31.150> else<00:03:31.390> you<00:03:31.540> felt<00:03:31.780> to

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
and the tip or anything else you felt to

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.600 
and the tip or anything else you felt to
see<00:03:31.959> I've<00:03:32.320> done<00:03:32.530> a<00:03:32.560> variety<00:03:32.800> of<00:03:33.010> designs<00:03:33.280> if

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
see I've done a variety of designs if

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.280 
see I've done a variety of designs if
you<00:03:33.700> want<00:03:33.850> to<00:03:34.060> take<00:03:34.720> a<00:03:34.750> look<00:03:34.900> at<00:03:34.990> my<00:03:35.080> facebook

nail<00:03:54.790> for<00:03:55.570> two<00:03:55.810> minutes<00:03:56.080> I<00:03:56.410> just<00:03:56.650> applied<00:03:57.220> one

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
nail for two minutes I just applied one

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.710 
nail for two minutes I just applied one
layer<00:03:58.030> of<00:03:58.209> topcoat

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
layer of topcoat

now<00:03:59.110> some<00:03:59.350> people<00:03:59.470> I<00:03:59.650> know<00:03:59.709> do<00:04:00.010> apply<00:04:00.280> too<00:04:00.340> but

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
now some people I know do apply too but

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.940 
now some people I know do apply too but
personally<00:04:01.420> I<00:04:01.630> find<00:04:01.959> that<00:04:02.110> one<00:04:02.320> is<00:04:02.500> absolutely

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
personally I find that one is absolutely

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.130 
personally I find that one is absolutely
sufficient<00:04:03.520> it<00:04:04.209> will<00:04:04.330> last<00:04:04.600> fine<00:04:04.930> because

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
sufficient it will last fine because

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.250 
sufficient it will last fine because
you've<00:04:05.410> applied<00:04:05.500> with<00:04:05.860> the<00:04:05.920> gel<00:04:06.100> bond<00:04:06.690> and<00:04:07.690> as

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
you've applied with the gel bond and as

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.720 
you've applied with the gel bond and as
you<00:04:08.380> can<00:04:08.470> see<00:04:08.650> there<00:04:08.800> that<00:04:08.830> way<00:04:09.100> they<00:04:09.280> still

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
you can see there that way they still

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.070 
you can see there that way they still
stay<00:04:10.320> very<00:04:11.320> sparkly<00:04:12.600> take<00:04:13.600> it<00:04:13.750> as<00:04:13.810> thin<00:04:13.959> as

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
stay very sparkly take it as thin as

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.810 
stay very sparkly take it as thin as
possible<00:04:14.110> over<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:14.650> crystals<00:04:15.100> it<00:04:15.340> doesn't

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
possible over the crystals it doesn't

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.180 
possible over the crystals it doesn't
matter<00:04:16.000> about<00:04:16.359> it<00:04:16.720> like<00:04:16.810> I<00:04:16.870> say<00:04:17.169> it<00:04:17.770> gives<00:04:18.070> them

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
matter about it like I say it gives them

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.070 
matter about it like I say it gives them
a<00:04:18.280> little<00:04:18.489> bit<00:04:18.730> of<00:04:18.940> extra<00:04:19.330> sort<00:04:19.510> of<00:04:19.660> staying

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
a little bit of extra sort of staying

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.140 
a little bit of extra sort of staying
power<00:04:20.320> but<00:04:20.650> it<00:04:21.340> really<00:04:21.580> is<00:04:21.640> the<00:04:21.760> gel<00:04:21.940> bond

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
power but it really is the gel bond

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.400 
power but it really is the gel bond
underneath<00:04:22.450> that's<00:04:22.600> holding<00:04:22.960> it<00:04:23.020> there<00:04:23.230> as

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
underneath that's holding it there as

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:24.930 
underneath that's holding it there as
long<00:04:23.950> as<00:04:24.040> you<00:04:24.100> make<00:04:24.250> sure<00:04:24.430> they<00:04:24.550> seal<00:04:24.790> the

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
long as you make sure they seal the

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.430 
long as you make sure they seal the
entire<00:04:25.030> nail<00:04:25.480> when<00:04:25.630> you<00:04:25.690> do<00:04:25.810> it<00:04:25.930> it<00:04:26.080> will<00:04:26.230> last

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
entire nail when you do it it will last

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.830 
entire nail when you do it it will last
absolutely<00:04:27.040> fine<00:04:27.280> so<00:04:28.000> there<00:04:28.120> we<00:04:28.240> go<00:04:28.360> that's<00:04:28.720> a
