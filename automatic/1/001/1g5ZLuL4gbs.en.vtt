00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
and a half and the end product is pretty

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.540 
and a half and the end product is pretty
much<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.239> same<00:00:45.420> they<00:00:45.719> sound<00:00:46.020> beautiful<00:00:46.559> but

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
much the same they sound beautiful but

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.369 
much the same they sound beautiful but
what<00:00:47.730> we<00:00:47.879> need<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.149> realize<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.140> reed

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
what we need to realize is that the reed

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.860 
what we need to realize is that the reed
should<00:00:50.250> be<00:00:50.399> able<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.640> vibrate<00:00:50.820> fairly<00:00:51.570> freely

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
should be able to vibrate fairly freely

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.779 
should be able to vibrate fairly freely
with<00:00:52.230> obviously<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.039> little<00:00:53.280> bit<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.520> structure

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
with obviously a little bit of structure

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.410 
with obviously a little bit of structure
within<00:00:54.239> your<00:00:54.390> embouchure<00:00:55.010> but<00:00:56.300> but<00:00:57.300> it

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
within your embouchure but but it

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.170 
within your embouchure but but it
shouldn't<00:00:57.750> come<00:00:57.989> out<00:00:58.460> fuzzy<00:00:59.460> with<00:00:59.579> no<00:00:59.760> clarity

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
shouldn't come out fuzzy with no clarity

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.139 
shouldn't come out fuzzy with no clarity
to<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.570> sound<00:01:00.920> because<00:01:01.920> maybe<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.760> use

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
to the sound because maybe you use

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.320 
to the sound because maybe you use
another<00:01:04.580> brand<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.760> reed<00:01:06.060> in<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.979> size<00:01:08.299> four<00:01:09.299> and

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
another brand of reed in a size four and

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.700 
another brand of reed in a size four and
a<00:01:09.510> quarter<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.080> you're<00:01:10.200> having<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.560> maybe

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
a quarter and you're having to maybe

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.920 
a quarter and you're having to maybe
play<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.040> four<00:01:11.460> in<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.790> Ricoh<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.600> doesn't

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
play a four in the Ricoh it doesn't

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.450 
play a four in the Ricoh it doesn't
really<00:01:13.049> matter<00:01:13.350> every<00:01:13.680> company<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.189> little

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
really matter every company is a little

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.120 
really matter every company is a little
bit<00:01:14.610> different<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.119> think<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:16.619> have<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.890> find

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
bit different I think you have to find

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.370 
bit different I think you have to find
the<00:01:17.340> right<00:01:17.520> Reed<00:01:17.790> for<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.869> seems<00:01:19.140> to

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
the right Reed for you that seems to

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.090 
the right Reed for you that seems to
have<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.799> beautiful<00:01:20.400> sound<00:01:20.640> with<00:01:21.600> as<00:01:22.100> little

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
have a beautiful sound with as little

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.160 
have a beautiful sound with as little
effort<00:01:23.400> as<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:23.939> need<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.780> can<00:01:24.960> make

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
effort as you need so that you can make

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.640 
effort as you need so that you can make
artistic<00:01:25.970> choices<00:01:26.970> without<00:01:27.840> having<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.409> just

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
artistic choices without having to just

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.100 
artistic choices without having to just
try<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.920> get<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.369> sound<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:30.570> come<00:01:30.810> out<00:01:31.340> so<00:01:32.340> I

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
try to get the sound to come out so I

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.580 
try to get the sound to come out so I
encourage<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.350> try<00:01:34.619> two<00:01:34.770> or<00:01:34.979> three<00:01:35.310> sizes

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
encourage you to try two or three sizes

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.740 
encourage you to try two or three sizes
before<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.799> start<00:01:38.520> buying<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.939> lot<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.150> boxes

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
before you start buying a lot of boxes

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.840 
before you start buying a lot of boxes
so<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.229> know<00:01:40.409> what<00:01:40.710> works<00:01:40.920> best<00:01:41.220> for<00:01:41.369> you

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
so that you know what works best for you

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.880 
so that you know what works best for you

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
in the rego light but I recently got

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.389 
in the rego light but I recently got
some<00:01:47.670> four<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.270> halves<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.750> see<00:01:49.189> how<00:01:50.189> they

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
some four and a halves to see how they

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.280 
some four and a halves to see how they
would<00:01:50.520> work<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:51.259> I'm<00:01:52.259> going<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.500> show<00:01:52.680> you

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
would work and I'm going to show you

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.810 
would work and I'm going to show you
what<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:55.409> sounds<00:01:55.829> like<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.189> plan<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.460> reed

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
what it sounds like to plan a reed

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.289 
what it sounds like to plan a reed
that's<00:01:57.060> too<00:01:57.299> hard

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
that's too hard

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.340 
that's too hard
first<00:02:00.299> of<00:02:00.420> all<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.570> have<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.810> work<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.140> lot<00:02:01.290> harder

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
first of all I have to work a lot harder

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.069 
first of all I have to work a lot harder
and<00:02:01.909> working<00:02:02.909> isn't<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.329> bad<00:02:03.509> thing<00:02:03.540> but<00:02:03.960> when

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
and working isn't a bad thing but when

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.149 
and working isn't a bad thing but when
it<00:02:04.200> gets<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.530> point<00:02:04.710> where<00:02:04.920> you're<00:02:05.009> just

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
it gets to the point where you're just

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.950 
it gets to the point where you're just
trying<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.430> make<00:02:05.610> this<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.240> reed<00:02:06.479> vibrate

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
trying to make this the reed vibrate

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.749 
trying to make this the reed vibrate
then<00:02:07.619> you're<00:02:07.740> not<00:02:07.890> able<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.190> think<00:02:08.280> about<00:02:08.640> what

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
then you're not able to think about what

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.059 
then you're not able to think about what
you<00:02:08.849> want<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.060> do<00:02:09.209> with<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.390> phrase

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
you want to do with a phrase

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:29.059 
you want to do with a phrase
oh<00:02:23.329> so<00:02:24.329> if<00:02:24.450> I<00:02:24.980> was<00:02:25.980> hard<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.609> then<00:02:27.319> if<00:02:28.319> I<00:02:28.530> put<00:02:29.040> a

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
oh so if I was hard and then if I put a

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:35.599 
oh so if I was hard and then if I put a
different<00:02:29.400> read<00:02:29.819> on<00:02:33.379> that<00:02:34.379> is<00:02:34.650> a<00:02:35.099> four<00:02:35.459> and<00:02:35.549> a

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:35.609 
different read on that is a four and a

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:37.520 
different read on that is a four and a
quarter<00:02:35.879> you'll<00:02:36.540> see<00:02:36.780> immediately<00:02:37.349> where

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
quarter you'll see immediately where

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:46.750 
quarter you'll see immediately where
there's<00:02:37.680> some<00:02:37.859> clarity

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.369 

one<00:02:47.760> thing<00:02:48.000> that<00:02:48.030> I've<00:02:48.480> realized<00:02:48.780> through<00:02:49.290> the

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
one thing that I've realized through the

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.800 
one thing that I've realized through the
course<00:02:49.680> of<00:02:49.859> my<00:02:49.919> career<00:02:50.400> is<00:02:50.489> that<00:02:50.699> when<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.569> read

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
course of my career is that when a read

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.420 
course of my career is that when a read
is<00:02:51.959> clear<00:02:52.290> it<00:02:52.409> doesn't<00:02:52.769> necessarily<00:02:53.310> mean

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
is clear it doesn't necessarily mean

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.520 
is clear it doesn't necessarily mean
it's<00:02:53.609> bright<00:02:54.049> I<00:02:56.449> many<00:02:57.449> times<00:02:57.540> I<00:02:58.079> make<00:02:58.379> the

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
it's bright I many times I make the

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.240 
it's bright I many times I make the
analogy<00:02:58.949> to<00:02:59.280> my<00:03:00.269> students<00:03:00.859> that<00:03:01.859> a<00:03:01.919> read

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
analogy to my students that a read

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.949 
analogy to my students that a read
should<00:03:02.519> be<00:03:02.669> like<00:03:02.849> a<00:03:02.879> really<00:03:03.239> good<00:03:03.359> stereo

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
should be like a really good stereo

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.640 
should be like a really good stereo
system<00:03:04.469> and<00:03:05.599> the<00:03:06.599> read<00:03:06.870> should<00:03:07.139> have<00:03:07.349> a<00:03:07.379> nice

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
system and the read should have a nice

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.770 
system and the read should have a nice
complement<00:03:08.310> of<00:03:08.519> treble<00:03:08.969> and<00:03:09.150> bass<00:03:09.480> and

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
complement of treble and bass and

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.429 
complement of treble and bass and
mid-range<00:03:10.579> but<00:03:11.579> if<00:03:11.669> you<00:03:11.790> have<00:03:11.969> a<00:03:12.000> read<00:03:12.439> that

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:13.439 
mid-range but if you have a read that

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:16.309 
mid-range but if you have a read that
doesn't<00:03:14.069> allow<00:03:14.519> for<00:03:14.549> any<00:03:14.879> of<00:03:15.329> the<00:03:15.540> symbols<00:03:15.989> in

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
doesn't allow for any of the symbols in

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.999 
doesn't allow for any of the symbols in
the<00:03:16.439> drums<00:03:16.709> but<00:03:17.069> only<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.430> bass<00:03:17.639> drum<00:03:17.959> then

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:19.009 
the drums but only the bass drum then

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:21.229 
the drums but only the bass drum then
it's<00:03:20.009> not<00:03:20.189> going<00:03:20.310> to<00:03:20.400> be<00:03:20.519> very<00:03:20.729> interesting

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
it's not going to be very interesting

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:22.399 
it's not going to be very interesting
you<00:03:21.329> know<00:03:21.419> and<00:03:21.689> you're<00:03:21.900> not<00:03:22.049> going<00:03:22.169> to<00:03:22.229> be<00:03:22.349> able

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:22.409 
you know and you're not going to be able

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:35.179 
you know and you're not going to be able
to<00:03:22.560> change<00:03:22.769> colors<00:03:23.280> within<00:03:23.609> your<00:03:23.879> sound<00:03:26.000> I<00:03:34.189> I'm

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:35.189 
to change colors within your sound I I'm

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:37.099 
to change colors within your sound I I'm
just<00:03:35.459> really<00:03:36.090> struggling<00:03:36.389> just<00:03:36.599> to<00:03:36.780> get<00:03:36.959> that

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
just really struggling just to get that

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.460 
just really struggling just to get that
just<00:03:37.579> to<00:03:38.579> get<00:03:38.729> the<00:03:38.849> sound<00:03:39.120> out<00:03:39.299> but<00:03:40.109> if<00:03:40.199> I<00:03:40.319> go

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
just to get the sound out but if I go

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.229 
just to get the sound out but if I go
back<00:03:40.650> to<00:03:40.680> that<00:03:40.949> other<00:03:41.009> read<00:03:43.819> which<00:03:44.819> by<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.060> way

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
back to that other read which by the way

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.420 
back to that other read which by the way
I<00:03:45.269> just<00:03:45.359> wet<00:03:45.959> a<00:03:45.989> few<00:03:46.290> minutes<00:03:46.620> ago<00:03:46.739> so<00:03:47.099> this<00:03:47.250> is

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
I just wet a few minutes ago so this is

00:03:47.430 --> 00:04:07.520 
I just wet a few minutes ago so this is
the<00:03:47.549> same<00:03:47.790> read<00:03:48.259> that<00:03:49.259> we<00:03:49.379> just<00:03:49.620> started

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.110 

so<00:04:08.530> you<00:04:08.620> can<00:04:08.860> do<00:04:09.040> so<00:04:09.250> much<00:04:09.400> more<00:04:09.430> and<00:04:09.880> change

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
so you can do so much more and change

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.910 
so you can do so much more and change
colors<00:04:10.480> when<00:04:10.510> you<00:04:10.840> get<00:04:11.050> into<00:04:11.290> the<00:04:11.410> right<00:04:11.620> size

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
colors when you get into the right size

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.950 
colors when you get into the right size
how<00:04:12.910> do<00:04:12.970> you<00:04:13.090> get<00:04:13.210> into<00:04:13.420> the<00:04:13.510> right<00:04:13.660> size<00:04:13.930> I

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:13.960 
how do you get into the right size I

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.450 
how do you get into the right size I
guess<00:04:14.290> you're<00:04:14.620> just<00:04:14.650> going<00:04:14.890> to<00:04:14.980> have<00:04:15.100> to<00:04:15.190> try

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:15.460 
guess you're just going to have to try

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.000 
guess you're just going to have to try
out<00:04:15.520> a<00:04:15.640> few<00:04:16.299> different<00:04:16.600> reads<00:04:16.840> and<00:04:17.260> and<00:04:17.530> it's

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
out a few different reads and and it's

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.150 
out a few different reads and and it's
always<00:04:18.250> nice<00:04:18.519> to<00:04:18.549> have<00:04:18.820> a<00:04:18.850> good<00:04:19.150> set<00:04:19.360> of<00:04:19.390> yours

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
always nice to have a good set of yours

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.500 
always nice to have a good set of yours
somebody<00:04:21.160> you<00:04:21.280> respect<00:04:21.700> to<00:04:21.910> listen<00:04:22.420> your

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
somebody you respect to listen your

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.220 
somebody you respect to listen your
teacher<00:04:22.780> or<00:04:23.700> and<00:04:24.700> and<00:04:25.450> make<00:04:25.720> sure<00:04:25.900> that<00:04:26.050> what

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
teacher or and and make sure that what

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.710 
teacher or and and make sure that what
you're<00:04:26.410> feeling<00:04:26.920> that<00:04:27.520> might<00:04:28.180> feel<00:04:28.510> like

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
you're feeling that might feel like

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.930 
you're feeling that might feel like
something<00:04:29.110> that's<00:04:29.290> bright<00:04:29.560> it<00:04:30.400> probably<00:04:30.820> just

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
something that's bright it probably just

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.370 
something that's bright it probably just
translates<00:04:31.480> into<00:04:31.720> something<00:04:32.230> more

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
translates into something more

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.740 
translates into something more
interesting<00:04:32.680> in<00:04:33.070> the<00:04:33.130> concert<00:04:33.520> hall<00:04:33.750> from

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
interesting in the concert hall from

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.070 
interesting in the concert hall from
afar<00:04:35.140> and<00:04:35.610> so<00:04:36.610> it's<00:04:36.850> it's<00:04:37.090> worth<00:04:37.300> spending<00:04:37.900> a

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
afar and so it's it's worth spending a

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.190 
afar and so it's it's worth spending a
little<00:04:38.260> bit<00:04:38.380> of<00:04:38.470> time<00:04:38.680> before<00:04:39.130> you<00:04:39.840> buy<00:04:40.840> lots

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
little bit of time before you buy lots

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.290 
little bit of time before you buy lots
of<00:04:41.380> boxes<00:04:41.620> of<00:04:41.860> reeds<00:04:42.370> that<00:04:42.550> are<00:04:42.640> too<00:04:42.790> hard<00:04:43.060> and

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
of boxes of reeds that are too hard and

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.040 
of boxes of reeds that are too hard and
feel<00:04:43.540> that<00:04:43.810> you've<00:04:44.470> not<00:04:44.770> you<00:04:45.310> failed<00:04:45.780> in<00:04:46.780> not

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
feel that you've not you failed in not

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.220 
feel that you've not you failed in not
being<00:04:47.290> able<00:04:47.410> to<00:04:47.530> make<00:04:47.770> the<00:04:47.890> reeds<00:04:48.100> vibrate
