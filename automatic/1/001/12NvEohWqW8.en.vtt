00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.450 
what the sole looks like out of the box
the<00:01:40.580> graphic<00:01:41.090> is<00:01:41.270> a<00:01:41.750> darker<00:01:42.740> black<00:01:42.950> color<00:01:43.280> and

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
the graphic is a darker black color and

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.679 
the graphic is a darker black color and
you<00:01:43.520> can<00:01:43.640> see<00:01:43.729> the<00:01:43.850> graphic<00:01:44.210> is<00:01:44.330> printed

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
you can see the graphic is printed

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.300 
you can see the graphic is printed
directly<00:01:44.990> on<00:01:45.260> top<00:01:45.439> of<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.680> soil<00:01:45.860> plate<00:01:46.130> as

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
directly on top of the soil plate as

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.820 
directly on top of the soil plate as
well<00:01:46.549> as<00:01:46.820> on<00:01:47.180> the<00:01:47.510> studs<00:01:47.869> and<00:01:48.080> the<00:01:48.439> reason<00:01:48.710> why

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
well as on the studs and the reason why

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.830 
well as on the studs and the reason why
it<00:01:48.890> actually<00:01:49.340> wears<00:01:49.549> away<00:01:49.759> is<00:01:50.150> because

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
it actually wears away is because

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.080 
it actually wears away is because
there's<00:01:51.049> no<00:01:51.290> protective<00:01:51.979> layer<00:01:52.280> for<00:01:52.939> the

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
there's no protective layer for the

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.520 
there's no protective layer for the
actual<00:01:53.479> paint<00:01:53.780> that<00:01:53.960> like<00:01:54.110> I<00:01:54.229> said<00:01:54.259> is

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
actual paint that like I said is

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.130 
actual paint that like I said is
directly<00:01:55.070> on<00:01:55.340> top<00:01:55.700> of<00:01:55.939> the<00:01:56.299> actual<00:01:56.630> soleplate

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
directly on top of the actual soleplate

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.429 
directly on top of the actual soleplate
and<00:01:57.439> studs<00:01:57.830> now<00:01:58.369> after<00:01:59.119> 20<00:01:59.479> hours<00:01:59.509> of<00:01:59.869> use<00:02:00.229> I

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
and studs now after 20 hours of use I

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.080 
and studs now after 20 hours of use I
think<00:02:00.799> you'll<00:02:00.920> be<00:02:01.040> pretty<00:02:01.220> surprised<00:02:01.700> to<00:02:01.909> find

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
think you'll be pretty surprised to find

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.480 
think you'll be pretty surprised to find
out<00:02:02.390> that<00:02:03.049> the<00:02:03.259> graphic<00:02:03.680> has<00:02:03.829> remained<00:02:04.250> intact

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
out that the graphic has remained intact

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.120 
out that the graphic has remained intact
really<00:02:05.479> really<00:02:05.840> well<00:02:06.079> based<00:02:06.680> on<00:02:06.860> how<00:02:06.950> it<00:02:06.979> feels

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
really really well based on how it feels

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.529 
really really well based on how it feels
and<00:02:07.610> how<00:02:07.670> it<00:02:07.790> looks<00:02:07.970> from<00:02:08.149> right<00:02:08.299> out<00:02:08.390> of<00:02:08.450> the

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
and how it looks from right out of the

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.330 
and how it looks from right out of the
box<00:02:08.720> I<00:02:08.929> expected<00:02:09.470> that<00:02:09.590> graphic<00:02:09.950> to<00:02:10.069> wear<00:02:10.220> away

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
box I expected that graphic to wear away

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.399 
box I expected that graphic to wear away
extremely<00:02:11.060> quickly<00:02:11.299> but<00:02:11.870> as<00:02:11.959> you<00:02:12.110> guys<00:02:12.230> can

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:12.409 
extremely quickly but as you guys can

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:14.440 
extremely quickly but as you guys can
see<00:02:12.470> that<00:02:12.799> has<00:02:13.280> not<00:02:13.610> been<00:02:13.849> the<00:02:14.060> case<00:02:14.090> I've<00:02:14.420> been

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
see that has not been the case I've been

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.000 
see that has not been the case I've been
really<00:02:14.750> really<00:02:14.840> impressed<00:02:15.440> with<00:02:15.860> the

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
really really impressed with the

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.710 
really really impressed with the
durability<00:02:16.370> of<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.910> graphic<00:02:17.270> again<00:02:17.360> it<00:02:17.599> has

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
durability of the graphic again it has

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.600 
durability of the graphic again it has
nothing<00:02:18.020> to<00:02:18.050> do<00:02:18.200> with<00:02:18.230> performance<00:02:18.920> it's<00:02:19.459> just

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
nothing to do with performance it's just

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:20.420 
nothing to do with performance it's just
something<00:02:19.849> that<00:02:19.880> looks

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
something that looks

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.160 
something that looks
pretty<00:02:20.579> cool<00:02:20.760> on<00:02:21.239> when<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.629> shoe<00:02:21.780> is<00:02:21.900> brand

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
pretty cool on when the shoe is brand

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.780 
pretty cool on when the shoe is brand
new<00:02:22.349> and<00:02:22.530> you<00:02:22.590> can<00:02:22.709> see<00:02:22.829> 20<00:02:23.250> hours<00:02:23.489> down<00:02:23.609> the

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
new and you can see 20 hours down the

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.509 
new and you can see 20 hours down the
line<00:02:24.030> it<00:02:24.239> still<00:02:24.870> looks<00:02:25.170> relatively<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.310> same

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
line it still looks relatively the same

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.220 
line it still looks relatively the same
not<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:26.760> lot<00:02:27.060> of<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.269> graphic<00:02:27.659> has<00:02:27.780> worn<00:02:28.079> off

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
not a lot of the graphic has worn off

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.149 
not a lot of the graphic has worn off
and<00:02:28.290> I'll<00:02:28.530> give<00:02:28.650> you<00:02:28.739> guys<00:02:28.829> a<00:02:28.890> side-by-side

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
and I'll give you guys a side-by-side

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:32.240 
and I'll give you guys a side-by-side
comparison<00:02:29.689> here's<00:02:30.689> the<00:02:30.959> U<00:02:31.319> shoe<00:02:31.620> 20<00:02:31.980> hours

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
comparison here's the U shoe 20 hours

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.670 
comparison here's the U shoe 20 hours
plus<00:02:32.549> here's<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.299> new<00:02:33.480> shoe<00:02:33.750> obviously<00:02:34.560> the

plus here's the new shoe obviously the

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.289 
plus here's the new shoe obviously the
graphics<00:02:35.069> are<00:02:35.189> now<00:02:35.310> printed<00:02:35.730> exactly<00:02:35.939> the

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
graphics are now printed exactly the

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.149 
graphics are now printed exactly the
same<00:02:36.480> on<00:02:36.719> all<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.230> shoes<00:02:37.500> they're<00:02:37.739> completely

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
same on all the shoes they're completely

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.220 
same on all the shoes they're completely
random<00:02:38.609> which<00:02:38.730> is<00:02:38.849> kind<00:02:39.030> of<00:02:39.150> cool<00:02:39.329> but<00:02:39.959> again

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
random which is kind of cool but again

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.319 
random which is kind of cool but again
the<00:02:40.620> graphic<00:02:41.040> has<00:02:41.219> remained<00:02:41.579> intact<00:02:41.790> it's<00:02:42.180> not

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
the graphic has remained intact it's not

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.000 
the graphic has remained intact it's not
quite<00:02:42.599> the<00:02:42.750> same<00:02:42.959> dark<00:02:43.349> black<00:02:43.680> that<00:02:43.889> you're

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
quite the same dark black that you're

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.619 
quite the same dark black that you're
gonna<00:02:44.099> find<00:02:44.370> when<00:02:44.609> they<00:02:44.700> are<00:02:44.849> brand<00:02:45.180> new<00:02:45.389> and

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
gonna find when they are brand new and

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.209 
gonna find when they are brand new and
the<00:02:45.959> soleplate<00:02:46.290> for<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.680> most<00:02:46.859> part<00:02:47.069> is<00:02:47.189> not

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:47.219 
the soleplate for the most part is not

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:49.220 
the soleplate for the most part is not
quite<00:02:47.579> as<00:02:47.730> shiny<00:02:47.969> that's<00:02:48.840> going<00:02:48.959> to<00:02:49.019> be<00:02:49.109> the

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
quite as shiny that's going to be the

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.959 
quite as shiny that's going to be the
case<00:02:49.379> with<00:02:49.590> any<00:02:49.799> shoe<00:02:50.099> I<00:02:50.340> mean<00:02:50.700> I'm<00:02:50.909> just

case with any shoe I mean I'm just
impressed<00:02:51.420> with<00:02:51.689> how<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:51.930> graphic<00:02:52.409> has<00:02:52.530> held

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
impressed with how the graphic has held

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.170 
impressed with how the graphic has held
up<00:02:52.950> you<00:02:53.069> can<00:02:53.189> see<00:02:53.310> even<00:02:53.519> on<00:02:53.609> the<00:02:53.730> bottom<00:02:54.030> of<00:02:54.090> the

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
up you can see even on the bottom of the

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.940 
up you can see even on the bottom of the
studs<00:02:54.450> that's<00:02:54.930> where<00:02:55.169> you<00:02:55.290> are<00:02:55.409> going<00:02:55.620> to<00:02:55.769> see

studs that's where you are going to see

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.710 
studs that's where you are going to see
the<00:02:56.370> most<00:02:56.609> amount<00:02:56.849> of<00:02:57.000> wear<00:02:57.180> as<00:02:57.329> far<00:02:57.510> as<00:02:57.599> the

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
the most amount of wear as far as the

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.170 
the most amount of wear as far as the
graphic<00:02:58.139> kind<00:02:58.379> of<00:02:58.500> chipping<00:02:58.859> away<00:02:59.010> but<00:03:00.000> as

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
graphic kind of chipping away but as

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.580 
graphic kind of chipping away but as
long<00:03:00.329> as<00:03:00.450> you<00:03:00.540> stay<00:03:00.750> away<00:03:00.930> from<00:03:00.989> walking<00:03:01.470> on
