something profound in him but most
importantly<00:00:51.870> for<00:00:51.960> me<00:00:52.230> was<00:00:52.860> being<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.160> beginner

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
importantly for me was being a beginner

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.979 
importantly for me was being a beginner
and<00:00:53.670> embracing<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.600> idea<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.809> being<00:00:54.930> a

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
beginner and being away from anyone know

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.130 
beginner and being away from anyone know
anything<00:00:57.360> about<00:00:57.449> Mei<00:00:57.690> didn't<00:00:57.870> tell<00:00:58.020> them

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
anything about Mei didn't tell them

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.510 
anything about Mei didn't tell them
about<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.410> film<00:00:58.620> or<00:00:58.800> about<00:00:58.920> my<00:00:59.039> chest<00:00:59.250> career

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.279 
about the film or about my chest career
and<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.359> could<00:01:00.570> just<00:01:00.690> learn<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.199> I

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
and so I could just learn and I

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.410 
and so I could just learn and I
experienced<00:01:01.920> again<00:01:02.190> what<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.820> had<00:01:02.969> experienced

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
experienced again what I had experienced

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.429 
experienced again what I had experienced
in<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.539> beginning<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:03.870> my<00:01:03.960> chest<00:01:04.170> career

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
in the beginning of my chest career

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.649 
in the beginning of my chest career
which<00:01:04.619> was<00:01:04.830> this<00:01:05.280> state<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.119> free-flowing

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
which was this state of free-flowing

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.929 
which was this state of free-flowing
learning<00:01:07.080> without<00:01:07.320> anything<00:01:08.100> blocking<00:01:08.340> my<00:01:08.610> my

learning without anything blocking my my

learning without anything blocking my my
process<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.630> ultimately<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.740> became

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
process and ultimately that became

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.170 
process and ultimately that became
fascinating<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.670> me<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:11.909> thought<00:01:12.030> about

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
fascinating to me and I thought about

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.149 
fascinating to me and I thought about
well<00:01:12.360> how<00:01:12.479> can<00:01:12.540> we<00:01:12.750> maintain<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.710> beginner's

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
well how can we maintain this beginner's

mind this this unstoppable learning

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.810 
mind this this unstoppable learning
curve<00:01:16.619> when<00:01:17.070> we're<00:01:17.220> very<00:01:17.369> good<00:01:17.520> at<00:01:17.640> something

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
curve when we're very good at something

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.249 
curve when we're very good at something
but<00:01:18.090> clearly<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.630> don't<00:01:18.720> do<00:01:18.900> anything

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259

do<00:01:40.290> all<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:40.619> physical<00:01:40.799> training<00:01:41.280> all<00:01:41.490> this

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
do all this physical training all this

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.190 
do all this physical training all this
incredibly<00:01:42.150> intense<00:01:42.420> technical<00:01:42.930> work<00:01:43.049> but

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
incredibly intense technical work but

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.649 
incredibly intense technical work but
also<00:01:43.320> physical<00:01:43.860> endurance<00:01:44.490> work<00:01:44.820> but<00:01:45.360> for<00:01:45.540> me

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
also physical endurance work but for me

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:46.999 
also physical endurance work but for me
it's<00:01:45.780> just<00:01:45.810> about<00:01:45.990> getting<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.350> body<00:01:46.770> out<00:01:46.950> of

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
it's just about getting the body out of

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.100 
it's just about getting the body out of
the<00:01:47.130> way<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:47.549> my<00:01:47.670> mind<00:01:47.850> can<00:01:48.030> play<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.270> game<00:01:48.450> so

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
the way so my mind can play the game so

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.969 
the way so my mind can play the game so
you<00:01:49.170> know<00:01:49.290> then<00:01:49.409> you're<00:01:49.500> in<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.649> martial<00:01:49.920> arts

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
you know then you're in the martial arts

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.230 
you know then you're in the martial arts
ring<00:01:50.250> you're<00:01:50.369> competing<00:01:50.549> against<00:01:50.850> these<00:01:51.000> huge

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
ring you're competing against these huge

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.569 
ring you're competing against these huge
bruisers<00:01:51.810> but<00:01:52.020> for<00:01:52.200> me<00:01:52.259> again<00:01:52.500> my<00:01:52.920> mind<00:01:53.189> is

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
bruisers but for me again my mind is

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.069 
bruisers but for me again my mind is
just<00:01:53.759> expressing<00:01:54.180> itself<00:01:54.390> through<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.810> arts

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
just expressing itself through the arts

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.420 
just expressing itself through the arts
and<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.259> think<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.799> ultimately<00:01:56.189> that's

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
and I think that that ultimately that's

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.420 
and I think that that ultimately that's
what<00:01:56.750> makes<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:57.869> succeed<00:01:58.259> having<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.710> mental

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
what makes you succeed having a mental

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.550 
what makes you succeed having a mental
side<00:01:59.700> having<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.329> deep<00:02:00.750> understanding<00:02:00.869> of<00:02:01.409> what

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
side having a deep understanding of what

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.230 
side having a deep understanding of what
you're<00:02:01.680> doing<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.040> can<00:02:02.130> express<00:02:02.460> your

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
you're doing so you can express your

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.429 
you're doing so you can express your
personal<00:02:03.659> new<00:02:03.810> ones<00:02:03.960> because<00:02:04.110> some<00:02:04.229> people

personal new ones because some people

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.690

some people are gonna be more
conservative<00:02:06.930> cautious<00:02:07.469> people<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:08.069> that's

arts you can think about a very large
movement<00:03:49.740> you<00:03:49.920> know<00:03:49.980> think<00:03:50.160> about<00:03:50.190> a<00:03:50.340> movement

ultimately<00:03:52.920> you<00:03:53.070> can<00:03:53.190> take<00:03:53.370> that<00:03:53.490> kind<00:03:53.610> of

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
ultimately you can take that kind of

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.310 
ultimately you can take that kind of
movement<00:03:53.910> and<00:03:54.210> condense<00:03:54.690> it<00:03:54.870> condense<00:03:55.170> it

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.620 
really studying hard well so I had this
experience<00:04:23.400> when<00:04:23.880> I<00:04:23.940> was<00:04:24.060> competing<00:04:24.300> in<00:04:24.479> the

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
and I was 170 pounds my opponent was 230

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
in the match my right hand shattered and

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.750 
in the match my right hand shattered and
I<00:04:38.230> felt<00:04:38.410> it<00:04:38.530> happened<00:04:38.800> I<00:04:38.830> was<00:04:38.980> he<00:04:39.370> was<00:04:39.400> a<00:04:39.520> bit<00:04:39.700> of

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
I felt it happened I was he was a bit of

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.250 
I felt it happened I was he was a bit of
a<00:04:39.820> dirty<00:04:40.000> player<00:04:40.360> very<00:04:40.540> hard<00:04:40.720> and<00:04:40.840> he<00:04:41.020> was<00:04:41.140> just

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
a dirty player very hard and he was just

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.500 
a dirty player very hard and he was just
a<00:04:41.320> crazy<00:04:41.560> crazy<00:04:42.490> exchange<00:04:42.970> and<00:04:43.120> I<00:04:43.180> just<00:04:43.300> felt

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
a crazy crazy exchange and I just felt

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.000 
a crazy crazy exchange and I just felt
this<00:04:43.750> this<00:04:44.170> shattering<00:04:44.590> here<00:04:44.710> and<00:04:44.800> I<00:04:44.860> had<00:04:44.950> a

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
this this shattering here and I had a

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.530 
this this shattering here and I had a
surge<00:04:45.250> of<00:04:45.400> heat<00:04:45.550> through<00:04:45.730> my<00:04:45.820> hand<00:04:46.030> and<00:04:46.210> then

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
surge of heat through my hand and then

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.020 
surge of heat through my hand and then
time<00:04:46.720> slowed<00:04:46.960> down<00:04:47.110> on<00:04:47.200> my<00:04:47.290> mind<00:04:47.410> and<00:04:47.940> on<00:04:48.940> the

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
time slowed down on my mind and on the

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.460 
time slowed down on my mind and on the
video<00:04:49.360> if<00:04:49.630> you<00:04:49.660> watch<00:04:49.930> it<00:04:50.080> his<00:04:50.200> hands<00:04:50.350> are

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
video if you watch it his hands are

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:51.870 
video if you watch it his hands are
coming<00:04:50.740> like<00:04:50.860> bullets<00:04:51.160> but<00:04:51.340> in<00:04:51.430> my<00:04:51.490> mind<00:04:51.700> they

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
coming like bullets but in my mind they

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.250 
coming like bullets but in my mind they
were<00:04:51.970> like<00:04:52.120> clouds<00:04:52.390> and<00:04:52.570> I<00:04:52.660> was<00:04:52.750> able<00:04:52.840> to<00:04:52.960> win

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
were like clouds and I was able to win

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.960 
were like clouds and I was able to win
very<00:04:53.410> easily<00:04:53.650> with<00:04:53.920> one<00:04:54.070> hand<00:04:54.310> and<00:04:54.550> this

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
very easily with one hand and this

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.490 
very easily with one hand and this
became<00:04:55.210> fascinating<00:04:55.810> what<00:04:56.080> was<00:04:56.170> going<00:04:56.350> on

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
became fascinating what was going on

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.880 
became fascinating what was going on
here

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
here

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.560 
here
what<00:04:57.100> was<00:04:57.220> going<00:04:57.490> on<00:04:57.610> here<00:04:57.820> well<00:04:58.000> I<00:04:58.030> I<00:04:58.330> mean

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
what was going on here well I I mean

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:59.730 
what was going on here well I I mean
people<00:04:58.990> have<00:04:59.110> had<00:04:59.290> these<00:04:59.470> fight-or-flight

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
people have had these fight-or-flight

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.070 
people have had these fight-or-flight
type<00:05:00.280> of<00:05:00.430> reactions<00:05:00.880> when<00:05:01.060> a<00:05:01.090> car<00:05:01.750> crash<00:05:02.050> a

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
type of reactions when a car crash a

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.630 
type of reactions when a car crash a
phone<00:05:02.350> and<00:05:02.590> certainly<00:05:02.860> these<00:05:03.100> times<00:05:03.400> slow

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
phone and certainly these times slow

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.160 
phone and certainly these times slow
down<00:05:03.850> I<00:05:04.090> had<00:05:04.480> the<00:05:04.570> experience<00:05:04.720> of<00:05:04.990> time

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.170 
down I had the experience of time

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.230 
down I had the experience of time
slowing<00:05:05.500> down<00:05:05.680> my<00:05:05.920> perception<00:05:06.400> sped<00:05:06.640> up<00:05:06.790> but

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
slowing down my perception sped up but

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.000 
slowing down my perception sped up but
then<00:05:07.330> my<00:05:07.450> question<00:05:07.780> became<00:05:07.990> how<00:05:08.230> can<00:05:08.770> you<00:05:08.860> do

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
then my question became how can you do

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.590 
then my question became how can you do
this<00:05:09.190> at<00:05:09.430> will<00:05:09.700> without<00:05:09.970> something<00:05:10.270> terrible

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
this at will without something terrible

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.150 
this at will without something terrible
happening<00:05:10.930> to<00:05:11.020> you<00:05:11.110> an<00:05:11.200> injury<00:05:11.530> or<00:05:11.590> something

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
happening to you an injury or something

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.860 
happening to you an injury or something
like<00:05:12.340> that<00:05:12.400> and<00:05:12.910> I<00:05:13.030> began<00:05:13.180> to<00:05:13.240> work<00:05:13.450> on<00:05:13.660> it<00:05:13.780> and

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
like that and I began to work on it and

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.660 
like that and I began to work on it and
I<00:05:13.930> began<00:05:14.170> to<00:05:14.350> work<00:05:14.530> on<00:05:14.710> this<00:05:15.460> kind<00:05:15.580> of

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:15.670 
I began to work on this kind of

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.910 
I began to work on this kind of
systematic<00:05:16.210> training<00:05:16.420> basically<00:05:17.410> and<00:05:17.740> I

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:17.920 
systematic training basically and I

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.380 
systematic training basically and I
described<00:05:18.250> it<00:05:18.400> in<00:05:18.460> depth<00:05:18.640> of<00:05:18.760> my<00:05:18.820> book<00:05:19.000> but<00:05:19.180> but

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:19.390 
described it in depth of my book but but

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.550 
described it in depth of my book but but
doing<00:05:19.600> this<00:05:19.690> kind<00:05:19.900> of<00:05:19.960> technical<00:05:20.320> work<00:05:20.440> in

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
doing this kind of technical work in

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.260 
doing this kind of technical work in
circuits<00:05:20.980> of<00:05:21.100> techniques<00:05:21.460> where<00:05:22.000> I<00:05:22.030> could

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
circuits of techniques where I could

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.670 
circuits of techniques where I could
throw<00:05:22.510> information<00:05:23.050> for<00:05:23.200> my<00:05:23.290> conscious<00:05:23.650> mind

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
throw information for my conscious mind

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.710 
throw information for my conscious mind
over<00:05:24.070> into<00:05:24.250> my<00:05:24.370> unconscious<00:05:24.700> mind<00:05:24.910> so<00:05:25.540> that<00:05:25.570> my

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
over into my unconscious mind so that my

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.270 
over into my unconscious mind so that my
conscious<00:05:26.080> could<00:05:26.200> focus<00:05:26.380> on<00:05:26.680> very<00:05:27.190> very

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
conscious could focus on very very

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.820 
conscious could focus on very very
little<00:05:27.730> but<00:05:27.940> I<00:05:27.970> could<00:05:28.180> do<00:05:28.360> that<00:05:28.570> very<00:05:29.410> deeply

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
little but I could do that very deeply

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.050 
little but I could do that very deeply
so<00:05:30.070> you<00:05:30.160> can<00:05:30.280> imagine<00:05:30.580> if<00:05:30.670> I'm<00:05:30.730> looking<00:05:30.850> at

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
so you can imagine if I'm looking at

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.030 
so you can imagine if I'm looking at
this<00:05:31.270> much<00:05:31.480> information<00:05:31.990> I<00:05:32.110> can<00:05:32.260> do<00:05:32.380> it<00:05:32.500> in<00:05:32.650> big

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:33.040 
this much information I can do it in big

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.860 
this much information I can do it in big
font<00:05:33.250> or<00:05:33.580> more<00:05:33.820> frames<00:05:34.120> than<00:05:34.330> my<00:05:34.420> opponent<00:05:34.810> so

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
font or more frames than my opponent so

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.660 
font or more frames than my opponent so
ultimately<00:05:35.080> you<00:05:35.290> can<00:05:35.410> plan<00:05:35.590> frames<00:05:35.950> the<00:05:36.520> other

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:36.670 
ultimately you can plan frames the other

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.340 
ultimately you can plan frames the other
person<00:05:36.940> isn't<00:05:37.150> aware<00:05:37.270> of<00:05:37.420> it<00:05:37.750> sounds<00:05:38.110> very

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:38.350 
person isn't aware of it sounds very

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.770 
person isn't aware of it sounds very
mystical<00:05:38.860> to<00:05:39.010> me<00:05:39.160> no<00:05:39.610> I'm<00:05:39.910> almost<00:05:40.240> afraid<00:05:40.660> to

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
mystical to me no I'm almost afraid to

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.480 
mystical to me no I'm almost afraid to
ask<00:05:40.870> this<00:05:41.140> question<00:05:41.530> but<00:05:41.680> it'll<00:05:41.920> be<00:05:42.010> my<00:05:42.130> final

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490
