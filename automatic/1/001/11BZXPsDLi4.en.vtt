00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.729
 now all welcome to live that in 

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:06.220
 I hope everyone is very well 

00:00:03.729 --> 00:00:09.370
 today I come with the advice video 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:12.009
 express number 3 and today we are going to talk about 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.019
 good masks all we should have 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:16.059
 the longest eyelashes in the world without 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.740
 have to use false eyelashes 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.810
 Well today I 'll show you some 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:23.250
 tricks for the eyelashes to 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.250
 have much much bigger 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.330
 the first trick using mask 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.210
 different can be any brand 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.670
 and any trick function number 2 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.550
 separate or mixed use what 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.460
 it means that you can put a 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.280
 layer over with one and then over the 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.940
 another or you can grab and open the two 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.400
 More expensive 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.620
 I only do this, I put it in the 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.800
 finger and with the brush that is not of the 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:55.340
 mask inserts it into the other clearer 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:58.310
 or mascara true and you add the masks 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:02.260
 thus this makes me 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:05.390
 the formulas are mixed and do as 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.420
 as a different as reaction in your 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.520
 lashes the third trick uses a 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.440
 china dong let me and our spirit 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.000
 how to use it for this you will have your 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.660
 mirror across the front of your face 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.610
 are you going to try the senator until what 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.100
 you feel in your eye I'm feeling it 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.409
 there and then 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.259
 and will start in china 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.509
 in this way, I really do it well 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.939
 slow just in case this one you grab the 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.509
 skin so look you have already felt a little 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.549
 and again it touches my skin and if it has 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.429
 more confidence because you can like more 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:45.390
 close now the eyelid eyelash and 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:48.840
 again gently you do it once what 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.030
 you loose a little bit you do it again and 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.759
 release it a little bit and you do another 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.860
 time but here on the tip and more more 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.010
 soft 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.650
 not even fourth trick will it be that 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.830
 when you put your eyelashes 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:08.130
 put your mirror down here like this and look 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:11.250
 down and start to put the 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.800
 mask from the bottom up very very 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.710
 very close d 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.740
 the root of the eyelashes and when you're 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.150
 looking down you tend to stain you 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.160
 minus the top part because when 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.220
 you're all over the front and you're doing 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.580
 this or if you're looking like this from this 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.310
 way you can if you brush yourself 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.710
 very wet that you are going to hit the eye 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.170
 It's especially like that, that's why I 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.840
 I keep down looked down and 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.940
 ava like that and I almost never get stained here 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.550
 up because the fifth and last 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.190
 trick with what you mask for 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.770
 below and above and let me show you 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.290
 quick how it's done ok as I told you 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.200
 they're going to have their mirror down here and I'm going to 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.660
 start putting on the mascara right 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.750
 from below like this 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.760
 and then I can put the mirror on 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.060
 little bit more to the front lower the 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.880
 look put my brush here and lower 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.650
 with the brush in this way and do as 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:15.439
 rollito now 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.439
 so for the tabs 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.180
 they are covered with masks and it does not matter if 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.860
 you're throwing down no matter 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:27.680
 but what it is is trying what 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.470
 they are covered in mask they are truly 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.320
 down and now immediately this goes 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.310
 mirror and start again to put your 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.310
 tabs up 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.530
 because here is the difference of the 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:44.080
 eyelashes with pretty mask with several 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.150
 layers and with the techniques that I said and 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.160
 here of course without a drop of 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.320
 mask 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.450
 good until he got tips express 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.100
