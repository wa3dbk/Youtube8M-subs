think that was really encouraging for
the<00:03:42.500> team<00:03:42.740> yeah<00:03:43.160> I<00:03:43.340> think<00:03:43.640> the<00:03:44.030> next<00:03:44.300> challenge

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
the team yeah I think the next challenge

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.480 
the team yeah I think the next challenge
is<00:03:44.780> obviously<00:03:45.290> working<00:03:45.650> out<00:03:45.860> how<00:03:46.010> it<00:03:46.130> can<00:03:46.280> be

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:46.490 
is obviously working out how it can be

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:47.440 
is obviously working out how it can be
better<00:03:46.760> tomorrow

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
better tomorrow

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.960 
better tomorrow
but<00:03:47.630> I<00:03:48.230> reckon<00:03:48.740> we're<00:03:48.860> up<00:03:48.950> to<00:03:49.100> it<00:03:49.220> but<00:03:49.700> think

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
but I reckon we're up to it but think

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.660 
but I reckon we're up to it but think
probably<00:03:50.540> what'll<00:03:51.080> help<00:03:51.260> that<00:03:51.560> is<00:03:51.740> talking<00:03:52.310> a

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
probably what'll help that is talking a

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.190 
probably what'll help that is talking a
lot<00:03:52.910> together<00:03:53.390> you<00:03:53.810> know<00:03:53.900> do<00:03:54.080> the
