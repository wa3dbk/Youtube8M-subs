00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
the economy first and in ways that is

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.039 
the economy first and in ways that is
better<00:01:41.670> but<00:01:42.000> if<00:01:42.180> he<00:01:42.299> has<00:01:42.420> extra<00:01:42.750> income<00:01:42.930> and

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
building them a Construction Yard you

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.859 
building them a Construction Yard you
starting<00:01:44.670> from<00:01:44.820> ground<00:01:45.030> on<00:01:45.210> again<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:45.630> taking

out the Construction Yard first
generally<00:01:48.659> tends<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.170> be<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.350> good<00:01:49.590> idea<00:01:49.939> as<00:01:50.939> you

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
generally tends to be a good idea as you

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.030 
generally tends to be a good idea as you
can<00:01:51.240> see<00:01:51.479> I've<00:01:51.659> retreated<00:01:52.049> my<00:01:52.320> stingrays<00:01:52.770> and

going to build I think it's a good idea
that<00:02:44.760> if<00:02:44.850> you<00:02:44.940> build<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.209> couple<00:02:45.540> of

now you can see he's bringing his flat

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.490 
now you can see he's bringing his flat
troopers<00:04:04.060> back<00:04:04.240> to<00:04:04.450> his<00:04:04.570> base<00:04:04.750> like<00:04:05.170> 10

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
troopers back to his base like 10

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.550 
troopers back to his base like 10
minutes<00:04:05.530> too<00:04:06.010> late<00:04:06.570> I<00:04:07.570> was<00:04:07.990> worried<00:04:08.350> at<00:04:08.470> the

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
minutes too late I was worried at the

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.760 
minutes too late I was worried at the
time<00:04:08.770> looking<00:04:09.250> for<00:04:09.400> my<00:04:09.580> sensor<00:04:10.390> because<00:04:11.320> he

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
time looking for my sensor because he

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.170 
time looking for my sensor because he
had<00:04:11.890> so<00:04:12.100> many<00:04:12.220> flat<00:04:12.520> troopers<00:04:12.850> I<00:04:12.940> thought<00:04:13.120> he

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
had so many flat troopers I thought he

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.220 
had so many flat troopers I thought he
was<00:04:13.270> going<00:04:13.360> to<00:04:13.420> take<00:04:13.570> out<00:04:13.750> this<00:04:13.870> thing<00:04:14.080> right

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
was going to take out this thing right

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.440 
was going to take out this thing right
if<00:04:14.410> he<00:04:14.500> focused<00:04:14.890> enough<00:04:15.100> thinking<00:04:16.030> this<00:04:16.239> I

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
if he focused enough thinking this I

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:17.610 
if he focused enough thinking this I
thought<00:04:16.750> I<00:04:16.810> was<00:04:16.989> going<00:04:17.110> to<00:04:17.170> go<00:04:17.260> for<00:04:17.380> the<00:04:17.440> power

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
thought I was going to go for the power

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.850 
thought I was going to go for the power
generator<00:04:18.160> and<00:04:18.640> I<00:04:18.730> thought<00:04:18.850> if<00:04:19.060> I<00:04:19.180> hid<00:04:19.390> out<00:04:19.510> the

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:19.860 
generator and I thought if I hid out the

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.710 
generator and I thought if I hid out the
generator<00:04:20.860> core<00:04:21.100> I've<00:04:21.370> got<00:04:21.640> a<00:04:21.670> win<00:04:21.880> now

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
generator core I've got a win now

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.110 
generator core I've got a win now
prepared<00:04:23.080> to<00:04:23.170> see<00:04:23.440> some<00:04:23.650> awesome<00:04:24.250> epic<00:04:24.610> fail

left flank he's going to try and take me

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.070 
left flank he's going to try and take me
out<00:05:23.770> of<00:05:23.980> one<00:05:24.130> go<00:05:24.310> we've<00:05:24.490> always<00:05:24.670> got<00:05:25.080> luckily

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
out of one go we've always got luckily

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.960 
out of one go we've always got luckily
for<00:05:26.290> me<00:05:26.440> these<00:05:26.740> helicopters<00:05:27.190> make<00:05:27.580> short<00:05:27.880> work

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
for me these helicopters make short work

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.260 
for me these helicopters make short work
of<00:05:28.270> an<00:05:28.390> entire<00:05:28.690> group<00:05:28.900> of<00:05:29.110> them<00:05:29.260> I<00:05:29.730> think<00:05:30.730> this

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
of an entire group of them I think this

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.090 
of an entire group of them I think this
is<00:05:31.330> around<00:05:31.630> the<00:05:31.750> time<00:05:31.810> he<00:05:32.140> realizes<00:05:32.560> he<00:05:33.070> is

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
is around the time he realizes he is

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.000 
is around the time he realizes he is
going<00:05:33.340> to<00:05:33.490> epically<00:05:33.910> fail<00:05:34.830> unfortunately<00:05:35.830> for

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010 
going to epically fail unfortunately for

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:40.680 
going to epically fail unfortunately for
him<00:05:36.570> now<00:05:37.770> granted<00:05:38.770> if<00:05:39.130> I<00:05:39.310> didn't<00:05:39.610> if<00:05:39.820> he<00:05:40.600> had

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
him now granted if I didn't if he had

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.060 
him now granted if I didn't if he had
enough<00:05:40.870> attack<00:05:41.110> bet<00:05:41.320> he<00:05:41.500> might<00:05:41.620> be<00:05:41.770> able<00:05:41.890> to

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
enough attack bet he might be able to

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.130 
enough attack bet he might be able to
maybe<00:05:42.970> not<00:05:43.150> destroy<00:05:43.450> me<00:05:43.600> but<00:05:43.780> look<00:05:43.990> what

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:44.140 
maybe not destroy me but look what

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.170 
maybe not destroy me but look what
happens<00:05:44.470> he<00:05:44.980> runs<00:05:45.190> into<00:05:45.370> the<00:05:45.460> only<00:05:45.790> terms<00:05:46.000> are

happens he runs into the only terms are

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.400 
happens he runs into the only terms are
you<00:05:46.240> from<00:05:46.390> constructed<00:05:46.960> and<00:05:47.110> that<00:05:47.230> was<00:05:47.320> only

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
you from constructed and that was only

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.560 
you from constructed and that was only
because<00:05:47.500> I<00:05:47.710> had<00:05:47.830> extra<00:05:48.130> money<00:05:48.280> and<00:05:48.520> this<00:05:49.420> is

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
because I had extra money and this is

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.240 
because I had extra money and this is
just<00:05:49.720> proof<00:05:49.960> that<00:05:50.020> a<00:05:50.230> couple<00:05:50.770> of<00:05:50.950> defense

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
just proof that a couple of defense
