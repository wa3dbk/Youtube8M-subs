hi friends this is Mahmoud Shaquille
here<00:00:02.429> and<00:00:02.639> in<00:00:02.850> this<00:00:02.970> tutorial<00:00:03.120> I'm<00:00:03.510> going<00:00:03.629> to

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
here and in this tutorial I'm going to

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.260 
here and in this tutorial I'm going to
show<00:00:03.780> you<00:00:03.959> how<00:00:04.740> you<00:00:04.799> can<00:00:05.040> design<00:00:05.250> a<00:00:05.609> tire<00:00:05.910> in

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
show you how you can design a tire in

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.780 
show you how you can design a tire in
CATIA<00:00:07.020> v5<00:00:07.080> using<00:00:07.770> the<00:00:07.890> part<00:00:08.130> design<00:00:08.490> and

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
CATIA v5 using the part design and

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.180 
CATIA v5 using the part design and
wireframe<00:00:09.179> in<00:00:09.330> surface<00:00:09.630> design<00:00:09.900> workbench<00:00:10.380> so

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
wireframe in surface design workbench so

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.860 
wireframe in surface design workbench so
what<00:00:11.309> you<00:00:11.400> can<00:00:11.580> see<00:00:11.790> here<00:00:12.120> is<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.509> completed

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
what you can see here is the completed

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.959 
what you can see here is the completed
design<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.530> tire<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:14.219> I'm<00:00:14.580> going<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:14.820> show

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
design of the tire and I'm going to show

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.660 
design of the tire and I'm going to show
you<00:00:15.030> how<00:00:15.330> you<00:00:15.389> can<00:00:15.660> design<00:00:16.049> this<00:00:16.550> from<00:00:17.550> the

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
you how you can design this from the

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.490 
you how you can design this from the
scratch<00:00:17.910> so<00:00:18.449> this<00:00:18.690> is<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.930> second<00:00:19.260> part<00:00:19.439> of

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
scratch so this is the second part of

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.380 
scratch so this is the second part of
the<00:00:19.590> tutorial<00:00:19.710> so<00:00:20.250> I<00:00:20.310> hope<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:20.640> have<00:00:20.789> watched

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
the tutorial so I hope you have watched

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.630 
the tutorial so I hope you have watched
the<00:00:21.570> first<00:00:21.810> one<00:00:22.080> so<00:00:22.800> I'll<00:00:22.890> just<00:00:23.039> come<00:00:23.220> back<00:00:23.369> to

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
the first one so I'll just come back to

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.790 
the first one so I'll just come back to
the<00:00:24.109> tire<00:00:25.109> study<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:26.480> we<00:00:27.480> have<00:00:27.769> then<00:00:28.769> created

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
the tire study and we have then created

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.569 
the tire study and we have then created
plane<00:00:29.519> on<00:00:29.820> top<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:31.250> we're<00:00:32.250> going<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.399> give<00:00:32.550> a

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
plane on top and we're going to give a

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.760 
plane on top and we're going to give a
sketch<00:00:32.850> here<00:00:33.079> so<00:00:34.079> in<00:00:34.200> here<00:00:34.380> we're<00:00:34.559> going<00:00:34.680> to

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
sketch here so in here we're going to

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.040 
sketch here so in here we're going to
you<00:00:35.460> know<00:00:35.579> make<00:00:35.880> some<00:00:36.149> patterns<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:36.780> we

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
you know make some patterns so that we

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.270 
you know make some patterns so that we
can<00:00:37.230> do<00:00:37.579> revolve<00:00:38.579> on<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:39.320> so<00:00:40.320> before<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:40.829> let

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
can do revolve on it so before that let

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.580 
can do revolve on it so before that let
me<00:00:41.399> just<00:00:41.520> increase<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.690> thickness<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.469> the

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
me just increase the thickness of the

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.330 
me just increase the thickness of the
time<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.829> little<00:00:44.129> bit<00:00:44.370> more<00:00:44.809> maybe<00:00:45.860> 7<00:00:46.860> th

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
time a little bit more maybe 7 th

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.770 
time a little bit more maybe 7 th
so<00:00:49.120> I'll<00:00:49.300> do<00:00:50.100> get<00:00:51.100> back<00:00:51.340> to<00:00:51.550> the<00:00:51.670> sketch

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
so I'll do get back to the sketch

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:05.200 
so I'll do get back to the sketch
nine<00:00:54.410> here<00:00:55.000> use<00:00:56.000> the<00:00:56.180> profile<00:00:56.570> tool<00:00:56.840> and<00:00:57.280> just

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:29.289 

draw<00:01:05.870> profile

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.020 

and

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.609 

infant<00:01:33.450> pal

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:48.750 

make<00:01:36.890> these<00:01:37.189> 2000

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:55.109 

and<00:01:48.850> make<00:01:49.570> these<00:01:49.900> two<00:01:50.170> points<00:01:51.150> consonant

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:00.050 

so<00:01:55.689> I<00:01:55.719> got<00:01:55.990> one<00:01:56.229> my<00:01:56.530> profile<00:01:57.100> over<00:01:57.399> here

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.410 

I'll<00:02:00.600> just<00:02:00.840> come<00:02:01.050> out<00:02:01.170> of<00:02:01.260> the<00:02:01.350> sketch

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
I'll just come out of the sketch

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.649 
I'll just come out of the sketch
now<00:02:03.930> what<00:02:04.080> I'll<00:02:04.200> do<00:02:04.409> is<00:02:04.440> I<00:02:05.000> will<00:02:06.000> come<00:02:06.270> back<00:02:06.420> to

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
now what I'll do is I will come back to

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.910 
now what I'll do is I will come back to
the<00:02:06.870> wireframe<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.350> service<00:02:07.770> design

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
the wireframe and service design

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.919 
the wireframe and service design
workbench

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
workbench

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.770 
workbench
we<00:02:09.929> need<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.760> project<00:02:11.760> this<00:02:12.240> particular

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
we need to project this particular

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.680 
we need to project this particular
sketch<00:02:13.350> into<00:02:13.890> this<00:02:14.040> part<00:02:14.430> so<00:02:15.300> we<00:02:15.420> have<00:02:15.600> an

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
sketch into this part so we have an

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.809 
sketch into this part so we have an
option<00:02:15.959> called<00:02:16.170> as<00:02:16.319> projection<00:02:16.920> here<00:02:17.160> so

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
option called as projection here so

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.420 
option called as projection here so
select<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.180> project<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:18.810> select<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.980> along

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
select the project and select the along

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.150 
select the project and select the along
a<00:02:20.670> direction<00:02:20.910> option<00:02:21.570> and<00:02:21.890> select<00:02:22.890> this

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
a direction option and select this

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.190 
a direction option and select this

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
if you can hide this I'll just leave it

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.990 
if you can hide this I'll just leave it
like<00:02:51.900> that<00:02:52.050> the<00:02:53.040> main<00:02:53.220> thing<00:02:53.400> is<00:02:53.550> you<00:02:53.820> should

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
like that the main thing is you should

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.690 
like that the main thing is you should
not<00:02:54.060> get<00:02:54.270> confused<00:02:54.720> with<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:55.080> now<00:02:55.920> the

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
go to the extrude option and give a

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:06.800 
go to the extrude option and give a
extrude
