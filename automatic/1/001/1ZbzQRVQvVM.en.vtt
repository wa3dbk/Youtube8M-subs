00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.500
 that a YouTube agent as they are I am 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.840
 encouragement and then we are other videos of a 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.020
 new facebook game called giving 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.699
 dark warriors or guardians or 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.650
 could mean black warriors but 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.539
 good this new game that you are seeing 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.669
 on screen, it's from the creators of 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.160
 social creators of Dragon City 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:34.590
 2 the ampayer be wars show him aliens 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.690
 is from sharepoint and those who do all 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.750
 the games he wrote up and then 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.430
 well this game is in the beta phase 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.290
 and because this game has told me that it's about 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.440
 how is it like a combination of all 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.330
 the games in one could only be said and 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.100
 puyol or study with the little ones then 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.330
 when another account to start from the 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.090
 principle to record what is the 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.860
 beginning of the game and to see what 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.170
 you see what this is first 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.430
 game let's say that the first level of 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.630
 this game and this one for you to see 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.150
 if you like it or not 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.860
 this is like you that you are controlling and 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.610
 you have to go killing enemies as 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:13.020
 long of this level 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:16.020
 ok here as a kind of bat the 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.730
 enemies send you the instructions 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.860
 little by little it's like the tutorial is 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.860
 I could say that more enemies 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.590
 then as armor ships and armor 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:33.720
 very well we have a sword and with combat 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.720
 with nails more enemies 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.850
 4 - and we raise the level 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.270
 apparently it 's simple by the 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.899
 moment or that there are more instructions 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.899
 ah 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:55.119
 this attack could be said ok is very 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.049
 good to charge all enemies 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.049
 to charge all enemies 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.000
 interesting today we're going to see how this is going 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.660
 is the tutorial I find a version 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.520
 beta of this game and who knows if it should 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.660
 be as good as what the show is 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:17.530
 the dragon city ​​hbo world monster legends 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.530
 I'm worried forget 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.840
 because we keep moving forward because 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.340
 we find 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.000
 because he seems like a kind of boss 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.000
 Of the level 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.740
 let's kill him 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.670
 to be here 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.670
 we have this 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.740
 the life 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.740
 I made him attack the boss 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.930
 cleansed 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.740
 we are 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.720
 i 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.720
 study if we already killed the boss 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.390
 very good victory 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.580
 things like the one that unblocks until 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.129
 you stop it one level of the monster legend I know 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.840
 when you attack someone to show him already 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:16.840
 it's like to choose the only 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:21.350
 link let's go on this exactly what 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:26.260
 same as we won an egg google tiger 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.260
 the tigers have eggs that crazy 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.170
 loading I think it's good 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.830
 that continues to carry what has already ended 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.380
 showed here our inventory 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:45.150
 tiger egg that is to be used with egg that 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:48.200
 a nazca uncle of an egg 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.110
 let's go ahead with a gem 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.630
 and then what you already saw is how 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.670
 it's like the dragon city ​​not your prick 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.930
 dragon or more or less better as the 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.770
 monster legend we know that you are 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:03.470
 dude uncle makes him eat tomatoes and they're 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.620
 tomatoes do not go down eating and 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.690
 will go up the level as in what is the 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.100
 dragon city not the monsters law itself 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.020
 same no 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:16.410
 and here you have more 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:19.220
 more levels by map or maybe like the 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.110
 Monsters missions 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.480
 it's called the master law we started as 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:28.270
 the missions or how we know to see everything 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.270
 the map ok and how many missions are 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.940
 that's why like 61 missions that topic does not 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.500
 mistaken 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.500
 breyer versus players 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.860
 many people people what apparently 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.779
 okay 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:47.779
 and friends 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.310
 let's see that beyond leaving we 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.560
 appears as you can see here it's like that 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.080
 a gem store city after 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.240
 bought things from with gems this does like 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.490
 that to improve your warrior the 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.530
 armor and the weapons that Lord has 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.470
 which is interesting because let's say 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.000
 it's like we're going to do is here they are is 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.720
 as if these were the chairs of the 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.430
 dragon city ​​and then your warrior is common 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.560
 as a warrior of these to the excess of 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.970
 ampayer you could say it's not with a 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.710
 citrus dragon combination the 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.710
 ampayer if I see it interesting not 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:27.710
 a little more are the battles not the 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.249
 battles in the pp as in the show 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.289
 legends 

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:33.529
 the world map the missions of the map 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:36.110
 it was like the first one is not the green dot 

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:38.240
 okay 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.850
 and you can continue like the missions of 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.340
 monster legends the attacks you have 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:47.350
 here the inventory of what you have 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.350
 the armors the weapons and the whole roll 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.640
 and then that's all you have for the 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.280
 remember that games are played in a 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:56.230
 alpha version could you say that 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:59.700
 4 is not 100% complete and that 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:01.410
 they will improve with the passage of time 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.000
 although this rally as a kind of 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:05.250
 missions 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.740
 it's like your kingdom another territory 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:10.260
 where are you after doing things like 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.730
 in the dragon city they thought that 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.470
 it's interesting what's going to start playing 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:15.510
 and if he saw that he is alive he calls me the 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:18.120
 attention is entertaining I will upload more saw 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:20.100
 this game so let me your opinion on 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.230
 game is called the guardians give 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.960
 dark warrior guards or warriors 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:26.460
 black the jungle link can the 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.780
 description from the game so that what 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.130
 play try it if you like it 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.350
 tell me in a table way that you foresee me 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:32.970
 upload more and upload more videos of this game 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:35.190
 that is entertaining is good is more 

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:37.740
 or less I what is more or less for 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:40.890
 the moment is not bad we could be 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.000
 something different because we always say to 

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:45.000
 of lampadarios is the same as the 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.470
 but not improved and then show the 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.720
 people are the same as dragon city but 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:52.500
 improved not and so in this game what 

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:55.230
 I see that this 9 appears in the tiger 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:57.450
 then keep adapting to eat well 

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:58.930
 there are farms I think is a farm or if there 

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:01.150
 farms well 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:04.150
 as well as a combination of those of all 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:06.160
 the games of sant boi not in only one what 

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:09.520
 that we have the bell is like a dragon 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.880
 of dragon city and blindness like the 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.880
 Warrior 

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:19.090
 ok warriors as a soldier than what 

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:20.949
 is the software only the ampayer if it is 

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:23.470
 a combination with their games and we put 

00:07:20.949 --> 00:07:26.290
 in charge more something different and now that 

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:27.910
 they did something different they do not believe and so 

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:30.190
 now our complaint of the record video 

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:33.190
