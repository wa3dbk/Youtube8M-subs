00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.729
 Ok guys, I'm sure it's going to be slow on the market 

00:00:08.729 --> 00:00:12.419
 and seeing children is the right hand so it's okay with neighboring post-cup 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:15.419
 lets go 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.560
 Okay, that's first served 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.310
 first rose game 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:33.450
 restaurateur 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.490
 that understood Abraham 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.490
 on mountain huts ESA has on the fifth fret on 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.910
 okay Daum is always a bit ray bitar 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.780
 slightly diagonally forward 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.280
 because you know that 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.880
 it is stuck 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.830
 Alan Menken or bought 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.120
 okay the next one 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.830
 trickier 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.290
 in fact 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.190
 if you have the chocolate or there are others for it anyway 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.220
 more so 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.090
 percussive 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.960
 Groitzsch Iran's rhythmic Croatia 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.619
 because on the guitar would have produced happy and delivery and beat 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:10.680
 also back in Bochum Borussia 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.070
 on the kiss Schongang thought that for example here 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.280
 if he just 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.550
 So it's just not possible 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.060
 with the four fingers Dr he also expects to build pointer and ring fingers 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.030
 the 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.230
 on the knee 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.470
 four pages here 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:27.610
 Shopping Spree 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.810
 after some difficult this action is true and sometimes nothing 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.010
 really too 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.530
 namely the dome on the landing page 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.520
 even who the page 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.680
 By penalty the FIA ​​should be on the credit side 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.700
 the beat up so that should not work well 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.500
 because the keeper must meet 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.590
 and indeed clap the pages demanded 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.160
 Ulm chopsticks as Chris Evans light this product battery ran Greulich it 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.300
 Rhythm instrument noise 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.189
 the clap 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:01:59.850
 dance clap 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.130
 in this they hit it 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.310
 because the topic 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.399
 So it's a bit difficult that would be true for grandma 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.430
 to be over 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.259
 Fingers waned very slowly 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.479
 and then 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.069
 that one is so on the side resident of this Grolsch new society in the 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.129
 Wrist her son on the move 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.579
 Warners action announced 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:20.269
 stay tuned to the Donkey Kong 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.680
 even a little bit off the skin that does not look bad either but he does 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.029
 need 

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:27.499
 So always practice well 

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:30.499
 that comes after what do something do 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.489
 and then you should pass one too 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.489
 The Dance too profoundly does not give him any tragic tips and betrayals 

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:40.179
 now works 

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:45.109
 sister-act should practice first line 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:48.109
 Michael should be tricky with the case in the box 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:52.349
 then that's been a huge bender for minibus reputation 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.879
 Blüm is 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:57.479
 how are things going after 

00:02:57.479 --> 00:03:00.909
 the percussive Santiago sank to Roots 

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:05.579
 single or dead notes good grades are louder city st 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:08.649
 after that the TV is out 

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:11.649
 Combs again what was not mistaken 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:18.259
 So you can also practice this out of shock 

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:21.259
 to come this far not so easy 

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:25.279
 OK 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.739
 Of course he is always practicing slowly 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.809
 stress 

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:38.870
 To do this you run the sequence of movements for the motor skills 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.870
 Maike Richter 

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:47.219
 what comes now after pastors apple-ceo comes 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.149
 Chord stop with the three fingers together 

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:56.149
 that's what Karen Bass lost too 

00:03:56.899 --> 00:04:00.679
 the story becomes and after what are these three fingers coming together 

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:03.229
 valley side 

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:04.299
 this is a game 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:06.339
 Mackenzie steady thing on the guitar 

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:09.339
 to play the three fingers together at the same time 

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:12.769
 Here the page should be fine this time 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:14.319
 Feel Duke Nukem 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:15.649
 not too tight though 

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:19.829
 has a good side contact and then the three fingers so closed 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.539
 was it really plucking 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:28.539
 Drill sleep deprivation touch will 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:35.069
 always nice soft sounds not rehearsed company sign posted 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:39.430
 Sheep 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.430
 then slowly 

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:48.939
 really turbulent the game 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.449
 that's how it happens 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:56.449
 7 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:00.669
 okay continue it 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:03.669
 I'm between Vaihingen is a conscious now 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.620
 Bobby Ryan 

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:12.939
 the organizers were about to retire 

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:16.499
 then he anticipates but 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:21.099
 Be parum 

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:26.029
 Borken 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:29.659
 Bonn 

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:32.260
 al 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.129
 that puts off 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:36.129
 Stephan Siemer and windy weather 

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:39.710
 Dr 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:40.750
 Now we have 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.439
 after the second couple 

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:45.969
 Hair from the swamp draw complex 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.270
 View the next one 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.870
 for that picture must be here 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.849
 to be seen 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:53.870
 Mexico has 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.129
 and he plays in the right hand now 

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:59.289
 Degenhart 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:00.650
 all four together 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.849
 Vierseitenhof is not that easy 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:06.139
 Matti Drammen 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:09.089
 Berlin next to percent 

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:11.839
 it therefore rumbled in addition to it 

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:14.839
 one should start so Williams June 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.550
 now in the direction 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.020
 it is so much more about the countermovement about it goes forward 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.409
 the 30-year-old inside that is so 

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:26.520
 but no power lost and 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.439
 which is important for the whole show the 

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:32.689
 because then with the hand Ludger getting high possible 

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:33.740
 so beautiful 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.740
 therefore forward the three fins to the rear 

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:44.860
 have good contacts 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.779
 Sundern 

00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:51.129
 important is that all four doors 

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:54.129
 nice and even in retrospect 

00:06:55.509 --> 00:06:58.509
 Martin of the classics, however, is quite happy 

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:03.439
 What really cool Tyndall makes sense the Billerbecker ammunition four different 

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:04.800
 Sounds at 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.439
 Emil Hansen Schindler 

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:10.379
 Relationship to each other 

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:13.699
 Lotus is well ahead of all four primary schools there 

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:16.699
 consequently 

00:07:18.349 --> 00:07:20.689
 Willi Kunzmann are formulated 

00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:23.689
 first handle closed again 

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.349
 25
