this<00:00:07.470> is<00:00:07.770> our<00:00:08.100> elevator<00:00:08.610> servo<00:00:09.090> it<00:00:09.360> is<00:00:09.570> a

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
this is our elevator servo it is a

this is our elevator servo it is a
Futaba<00:00:10.139> as<00:00:10.550> 3004<00:00:11.550> we<00:00:12.270> have<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.570> push<00:00:12.809> rod

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
Futaba as 3004 we have the push rod

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.990 
Futaba as 3004 we have the push rod
installed<00:00:13.530> we<00:00:13.770> offer<00:00:13.889> fast<00:00:14.219> link<00:00:14.580> installed

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
installed we offer fast link installed

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.890 
installed we offer fast link installed
we<00:00:15.600> did<00:00:15.870> power<00:00:16.200> the<00:00:16.379> servo<00:00:16.830> up<00:00:16.950> and<00:00:17.160> center<00:00:17.580> it

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
we did power the servo up and center it

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.050 
we did power the servo up and center it
before<00:00:18.900> we<00:00:19.020> installed<00:00:19.440> our<00:00:20.160> push<00:00:20.520> rod<00:00:20.760> into

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
before we installed our push rod into

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.340 
before we installed our push rod into
the<00:00:21.350> servo<00:00:22.350> arm<00:00:23.240> these<00:00:24.240> two<00:00:24.570> items<00:00:24.930> here<00:00:24.990> are

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
the servo arm these two items here are

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.110 
the servo arm these two items here are
your<00:00:25.560> wheel<00:00:25.740> collars<00:00:26.250> they're<00:00:26.580> gonna<00:00:26.670> be<00:00:26.850> used

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:27.120 
your wheel collars they're gonna be used

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.830 
your wheel collars they're gonna be used
for<00:00:27.360> the<00:00:28.050> other<00:00:28.610> elevator<00:00:29.610> the<00:00:30.180> push<00:00:30.420> rod<00:00:30.690> from

the other elevator is going to slide
through<00:00:33.030> these<00:00:33.239> collars<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.020> you're<00:00:34.170> gonna

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
through these collars and you're gonna

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.500 
through these collars and you're gonna
use<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.469> fastener<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.370> secure<00:00:35.820> them<00:00:35.969> all

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
use a fastener to secure them all

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.919 
use a fastener to secure them all
