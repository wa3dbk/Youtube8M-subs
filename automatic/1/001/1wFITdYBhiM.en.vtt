quite a few people ask me whether up the

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.370 
quite a few people ask me whether up the
GoPro<00:00:19.039> hero3<00:00:19.430> will<00:00:20.420> feed<00:00:20.660> into<00:00:20.689> the<00:00:20.900> gopro

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
GoPro hero3 will feed into the gopro

GoPro hero3 will feed into the gopro
hero2<00:00:22.039> housing<00:00:22.789> and<00:00:22.939> vice<00:00:23.480> versa<00:00:24.020> so<00:00:24.650> let's

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:24.829 
hero2 housing and vice versa so let's

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:40.690 
hero2 housing and vice versa so let's
have<00:00:24.919> a<00:00:24.980> look<00:00:25.039> and<00:00:25.250> see<00:00:38.379> okay<00:00:39.489> firstly<00:00:40.489> let's

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
have a look and see okay firstly let's

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:48.880 
have a look and see okay firstly let's
try<00:00:40.969> the<00:00:41.030> hero<00:00:41.420> 3<00:00:41.809> in<00:00:42.469> here<00:00:42.950> o2<00:00:43.250> housing<00:00:47.890> okay

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
try the hero 3 in here o2 housing okay

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.160 
try the hero 3 in here o2 housing okay
was<00:00:49.609> the<00:00:49.730> fairly<00:00:50.030> obvious<00:00:50.449> problem<00:00:50.870> straight

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
was the fairly obvious problem straight

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
was the fairly obvious problem straight
away<00:00:51.440> is<00:00:52.280> that<00:00:52.789> the<00:00:53.089> hero<00:00:53.390> 3<00:00:53.989> is<00:00:54.319> a<00:00:54.379> lot<00:00:54.710> smaller

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
away is that the hero 3 is a lot smaller

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.869 
away is that the hero 3 is a lot smaller
than<00:00:55.519> the<00:00:55.640> hero<00:00:55.879> too<00:00:55.999> and<00:00:57.339> you'd<00:00:58.339> need<00:00:58.579> some

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
than the hero too and you'd need some

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:00.819 
than the hero too and you'd need some
sort<00:00:59.149> of<00:00:59.239> padding<00:00:59.870> if<00:01:00.019> you<00:01:00.140> could<00:01:00.350> get<00:01:00.499> it<00:01:00.649> into

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
sort of padding if you could get it into

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.210 
sort of padding if you could get it into
the<00:01:01.069> housing<00:01:01.550> to<00:01:02.539> make<00:01:03.440> sure<00:01:03.710> that<00:01:03.979> the<00:01:04.070> back

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
the housing to make sure that the back

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.830 
the housing to make sure that the back
door<00:01:04.550> will<00:01:04.850> close<00:01:04.879> and<00:01:05.420> it<00:01:05.540> wasn't<00:01:05.810> just

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
door will close and it wasn't just

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.010 
door will close and it wasn't just
swapping<00:01:06.710> around<00:01:07.190> in<00:01:07.370> the<00:01:07.460> case<00:01:07.810> but<00:01:08.810> the

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
swapping around in the case but the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.969 
swapping around in the case but the
other<00:01:09.170> problem<00:01:09.350> is<00:01:09.880> the<00:01:10.880> lens<00:01:11.620> this<00:01:12.620> doesn't

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
other problem is the lens this doesn't

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.300 
other problem is the lens this doesn't
line<00:01:13.430> up<00:01:13.460> with<00:01:13.670> this<00:01:14.090> lens<00:01:14.390> housing<00:01:15.049> here<00:01:15.320> so

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
line up with this lens housing here so

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.260 
line up with this lens housing here so
it<00:01:17.090> won't<00:01:17.570> actually<00:01:18.520> physically<00:01:19.520> go<00:01:19.760> in<00:01:20.000> there

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
it won't actually physically go in there

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.200 
it won't actually physically go in there
so<00:01:21.050> that's<00:01:21.650> not<00:01:21.950> going<00:01:22.160> to<00:01:22.280> work<00:01:24.880> ok<00:01:25.880> what

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
so that's not going to work ok what

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:34.060 
so that's not going to work ok what
about<00:01:26.240> hero<00:01:26.810> 2<00:01:26.870> in<00:01:27.770> the<00:01:28.130> hero<00:01:28.400> 3<00:01:28.700> housing<00:01:33.070> all

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
about hero 2 in the hero 3 housing all

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.690 
about hero 2 in the hero 3 housing all
right<00:01:34.250> sort<00:01:34.700> of<00:01:34.790> the<00:01:34.880> way<00:01:35.030> it<00:01:35.210> is<00:01:35.330> a<00:01:36.700> fairly

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
right sort of the way it is a fairly

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.930 
right sort of the way it is a fairly
obvious<00:01:38.150> problem<00:01:38.600> there<00:01:38.840> the<00:01:39.650> hero<00:01:40.010> 2<00:01:40.370> is<00:01:40.700> just

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
obvious problem there the hero 2 is just

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.570 
obvious problem there the hero 2 is just
way<00:01:41.300> bigger<00:01:41.840> than<00:01:41.870> they<00:01:42.110> sounded<00:01:42.650> so<00:01:43.340> there's

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
way bigger than they sounded so there's

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.580 
way bigger than they sounded so there's
no<00:01:43.700> way<00:01:44.090> you're<00:01:44.810> going<00:01:44.930> to<00:01:45.050> be<00:01:45.140> able<00:01:45.230> to<00:01:45.380> shut

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
no way you're going to be able to shut

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.390 
no way you're going to be able to shut
this<00:01:45.740> back<00:01:45.980> door<00:01:47.020> even<00:01:48.020> if<00:01:48.140> you<00:01:48.290> put<00:01:48.590> a<00:01:48.800> bigger

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
this back door even if you put a bigger

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.790 
this back door even if you put a bigger
back<00:01:49.640> door<00:01:49.910> on<00:01:50.120> that<00:01:51.640> may<00:01:52.640> be<00:01:53.170> but<00:01:54.170> the<00:01:54.440> problem

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
back door on that may be but the problem

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:02.170 
back door on that may be but the problem
is<00:01:55.720> this<00:01:56.720> part<00:01:57.350> of<00:01:57.500> the<00:01:57.590> camera<00:01:58.040> here<00:01:58.780> must<00:01:59.780> be

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
is this part of the camera here must be

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.240 
is this part of the camera here must be
slightly<00:02:03.050> bigger<00:02:03.260> than<00:02:03.530> this<00:02:03.650> part<00:02:03.980> of<00:02:04.100> the

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
slightly bigger than this part of the

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.160 
slightly bigger than this part of the
hero3<00:02:06.160> because<00:02:07.160> you<00:02:07.310> can't<00:02:07.760> actually<00:02:08.390> push

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
hero3 because you can't actually push

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.440 
hero3 because you can't actually push
the<00:02:09.410> hero<00:02:09.740> to<00:02:09.860> all<00:02:10.310> the<00:02:10.580> way<00:02:10.729> into<00:02:10.910> the<00:02:11.030> housing

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
the hero to all the way into the housing

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.680 
the hero to all the way into the housing
the<00:02:12.380> lens<00:02:12.680> doesn't<00:02:13.550> line<00:02:13.910> up<00:02:13.940> here<00:02:14.510> either

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
the lens doesn't line up here either

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.880 
the lens doesn't line up here either
though<00:02:15.560> I<00:02:16.040> think<00:02:16.640> there's<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.090> answer<00:02:17.890> you

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
though I think there's the answer you

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.630 
though I think there's the answer you
cannot<00:02:19.280> put<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:19.790> hero<00:02:20.180> 2<00:02:20.980> into<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.100> hero<00:02:22.280> 3

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
cannot put the hero 2 into the hero 3

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.090 
cannot put the hero 2 into the hero 3
case<00:02:22.880> and<00:02:23.240> you<00:02:23.630> cannot<00:02:23.870> put<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.260> hero<00:02:24.530> 3<00:02:24.860> into

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
case and you cannot put the hero 3 into

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.490 
case and you cannot put the hero 3 into
the<00:02:25.190> hero<00:02:25.459> two<00:02:25.760> guys<00:02:26.170> better<00:02:27.170> off<00:02:27.320> leaving

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
the hero two guys better off leaving

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.699 
the hero two guys better off leaving
them<00:02:27.830> in<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:28.459> cases<00:02:28.970> where<00:02:29.000> they<00:02:29.300> belong<00:02:29.709> this

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
them in the cases where they belong this

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:41.370 
them in the cases where they belong this
