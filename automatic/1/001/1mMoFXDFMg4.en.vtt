00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.090 
my hair look as bad as hers and then
what<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.359> think<00:01:00.629> she<00:01:00.750> does<00:01:00.960> after<00:01:01.559> she<00:01:01.800> makes

what I think she does after she makes
her<00:01:02.280> hair<00:01:02.489> look<00:01:02.760> as<00:01:02.910> boring<00:01:03.510> as<00:01:03.719> possible

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
her hair look as boring as possible

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.109 
her hair look as boring as possible
she's<00:01:04.799> like<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.100> know<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.280> just<00:01:05.519> there's<00:01:06.060> just

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
she's like you know I just there's just

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.630 
she's like you know I just there's just
too<00:01:06.479> much<00:01:06.630> rose<00:01:07.110> in<00:01:07.860> my<00:01:08.040> cheeks

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
too much rose in my cheeks

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.149 
too much rose in my cheeks
there's<00:01:08.850> too<00:01:09.090> much<00:01:09.330> color<00:01:09.900> on<00:01:10.049> my<00:01:10.500> lips<00:01:10.770> and

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
there's too much color on my lips and

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.580 
there's too much color on my lips and
then<00:01:11.369> she<00:01:11.610> decides<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.270> just<00:01:12.750> remove<00:01:13.290> her

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
then she decides to just remove her

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.590 
then she decides to just remove her
makeup<00:01:13.979> take<00:01:14.340> most<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.790> colour<00:01:15.000> off<00:01:15.390> your

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
makeup take most the colour off your

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.780 
makeup take most the colour off your
lips<00:01:15.810> maybe<00:01:16.080> leave<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.650> little<00:01:16.979> bit<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.250> glisten

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
lips maybe leave a little bit of glisten

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.749 
lips maybe leave a little bit of glisten
make<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.360> look<00:01:18.509> like<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.900> just<00:01:18.930> had<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.229> couple

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
make it look like you just had a couple

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.580 
make it look like you just had a couple
cosmos<00:01:20.759> before<00:01:21.240> recording<00:01:21.780> alright<00:01:22.229> no<00:01:22.560> I

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
cosmos before recording alright no I

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.560 
cosmos before recording alright no I
guess<00:01:22.979> not<00:01:23.009> cosmos<00:01:23.820> because<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.270> guess<00:01:24.420> she

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
guess not cosmos because I guess she

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.749 
guess not cosmos because I guess she
probably<00:01:24.810> doesn't<00:01:25.259> drink<00:01:25.920> much<00:01:26.130> after<00:01:26.580> she

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
probably doesn't drink much after she

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.550 
probably doesn't drink much after she
went<00:01:27.030> crazy<00:01:27.360> or<00:01:27.600> whatever<00:01:27.930> but<00:01:28.170> I'm<00:01:28.259> guessing

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
went crazy or whatever but I'm guessing

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.410 
went crazy or whatever but I'm guessing
she<00:01:28.740> probably<00:01:29.250> drinks<00:01:29.610> something<00:01:29.850> like

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
she probably drinks something like

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.179 
she probably drinks something like
something<00:01:30.720> like<00:01:30.840> this<00:01:31.079> Listerine<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:31.890> mean

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
something like this Listerine I mean

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.740 
something like this Listerine I mean
this<00:01:32.310> has<00:01:32.490> alcohol<00:01:32.729> in<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.450> can<00:01:33.600> walk

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
this has alcohol in it you can walk

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.420 
this has alcohol in it you can walk
around<00:01:33.930> with<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.290> it's<00:01:34.500> not<00:01:34.650> not<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.159> live

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
around with this it's not not to live

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.490 
around with this it's not not to live
you<00:01:35.790> know<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.210> then<00:01:36.299> after<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.840> get<00:01:37.079> drunk<00:01:37.350> on

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500
