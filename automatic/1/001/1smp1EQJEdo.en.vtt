ideas for a nother channel so I thought

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.660 
ideas for a nother channel so I thought
I'd<00:00:18.480> do<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.750> quick<00:00:18.869> introduction<00:00:19.650> video<00:00:20.039> on<00:00:20.279> how

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
to do black screen ok so the idea of

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.510 
to do black screen ok so the idea of
black<00:00:30.840> screen<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:32.189> have<00:00:32.369> your

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
black screen is that you have your

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.549 
black screen is that you have your

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
in front of it and behind the ring light

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.830 
in front of it and behind the ring light
right<00:01:16.830> there<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:17.070> have<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.310> case<00:01:17.610> on<00:01:17.909> which<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.479> sit

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
right there I have a case on which I sit

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.810 
right there I have a case on which I sit
to<00:01:18.960> my<00:01:19.080> camera<00:01:19.590> on<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.799> little<00:01:20.040> tiny<00:01:20.369> mini

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
to my camera on a little tiny mini

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.340 
to my camera on a little tiny mini
tripod<00:01:21.470> so<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.619> actually<00:01:22.950> shines<00:01:23.280> through<00:01:24.350> the

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
tripod so it actually shines through the

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.700 
tripod so it actually shines through the
back<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.130> ring<00:01:26.280> light<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:27.710> obviously

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
back of the ring light and obviously

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.730 
back of the ring light and obviously
what<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:28.890> have<00:01:29.130> here<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.640> big<00:01:29.939> black<00:01:30.750> piece<00:01:31.710> of

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
what I have here is a big black piece of

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.940 
what I have here is a big black piece of
cloth<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.400> goes<00:01:33.060> from<00:01:33.240> floor<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.509> ceiling<00:01:33.950> on

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
cloth that goes from floor to ceiling on

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.530 
cloth that goes from floor to ceiling on
the<00:01:35.220> wall<00:01:35.400> at<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.640> back<00:01:35.850> has<00:01:36.060> just<00:01:36.299> held<00:01:36.479> up

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
the wall at the back has just held up

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.749 
the wall at the back has just held up
with<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.689> couple<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:36.990> drawing<00:01:37.200> pins<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.759> when

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
with a couple of drawing pins and when

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.460 
with a couple of drawing pins and when
you<00:01:38.850> go<00:01:38.970> behind<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.600> ring<00:01:39.780> light<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.200> you're

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
you go behind the ring light and you're

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.710 
you go behind the ring light and you're
sort<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:40.920> pointing<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.490> way<00:01:41.729> all<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.540> get<00:01:42.689> to

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
sort of pointing that way all you get to

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.859 
sort of pointing that way all you get to
see<00:01:42.869> is<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.470> person<00:01:43.500> sat<00:01:44.070> in<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.399> chair<00:01:44.869> with

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
see is the person sat in a chair with

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.780 
see is the person sat in a chair with
just<00:01:46.320> blank<00:01:46.680> screen<00:01:46.979> behind<00:01:47.280> them<00:01:47.369> now<00:01:47.520> the

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
just blank screen behind them now the

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.020 
just blank screen behind them now the
idea<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.479> when<00:01:48.740> you're<00:01:49.740> close<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.610> camera

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
idea is when you're close to the camera

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.460 
idea is when you're close to the camera
you<00:01:51.060> put<00:01:51.270> your<00:01:51.360> camera<00:01:51.479> on<00:01:51.600> also<00:01:51.960> settings

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
you put your camera on also settings

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.230 
you put your camera on also settings
what<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.740> does<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.130> darkens<00:01:53.610> everything<00:01:54.030> down

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
what it does it darkens everything down

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.499 
what it does it darkens everything down
so<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:55.140> only<00:01:55.549> if<00:01:56.549> you're<00:01:56.729> in<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.030> middle<00:01:57.329> of

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
so it only if you're in the middle of

LCD screen but as soon as I sit down you

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.410 
LCD screen but as soon as I sit down you
just<00:02:19.739> turn<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:19.950> little<00:02:20.220> worth<00:02:20.640> dual<00:02:21.150> thing

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
just turn that little worth dual thing

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.780 
just turn that little worth dual thing
down<00:02:21.599> sorry<00:02:22.019> yeah<00:02:22.170> not<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:22.920> camera<00:02:23.190> over<00:02:23.280> what

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
down sorry yeah not the camera over what

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.220 
down sorry yeah not the camera over what
happens<00:02:24.180> is<00:02:24.330> because<00:02:24.450> I've<00:02:24.750> suddenly<00:02:25.050> got

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
happens is because I've suddenly got

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.900 
happens is because I've suddenly got
brighter<00:02:26.040> I'm<00:02:26.310> sort<00:02:26.550> of<00:02:26.610> right<00:02:26.760> in<00:02:26.849> the

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
brighter I'm sort of right in the

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.330 
brighter I'm sort of right in the
foreground<00:02:27.239> here<00:02:27.599> the<00:02:28.260> camera<00:02:28.620> compensates

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
foreground here the camera compensates

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.100 
foreground here the camera compensates
and<00:02:29.610> then<00:02:29.730> it<00:02:29.880> darkens<00:02:30.300> everything<00:02:30.420> else<00:02:30.840> down

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
and then it darkens everything else down

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.040 
and then it darkens everything else down
so<00:02:31.800> that's<00:02:32.730> that's<00:02:33.120> basically<00:02:33.480> how<00:02:33.690> I<00:02:33.720> do<00:02:33.930> it

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
so that's that's basically how I do it

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.020 
so that's that's basically how I do it
and<00:02:34.110> if<00:02:34.319> you<00:02:34.470> can<00:02:34.769> see<00:02:35.130> when<00:02:35.819> you're<00:02:35.940> editing

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
and if you can see when you're editing

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.420 
and if you can see when you're editing
if<00:02:36.360> you<00:02:36.480> can<00:02:36.720> see<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:37.080> actual<00:02:37.410> cloth<00:02:38.099> in<00:02:38.340> the

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
if you can see the actual cloth in the

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.800 
if you can see the actual cloth in the
background<00:02:38.790> all<00:02:38.910> you<00:02:39.060> do<00:02:39.180> is<00:02:39.300> you<00:02:39.420> just<00:02:39.450> get

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
background all you do is you just get

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.720 
background all you do is you just get
get<00:02:40.049> onto<00:02:40.200> your<00:02:40.410> contrast<00:02:40.860> controls<00:02:41.430> and<00:02:41.670> your

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
get onto your contrast controls and your

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.630 
get onto your contrast controls and your
darken<00:02:42.150> things<00:02:42.299> down<00:02:42.630> a<00:02:42.660> little<00:02:42.840> bit<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:43.640> it

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
darken things down a little bit and it

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.820 
darken things down a little bit and it
will<00:02:44.730> take<00:02:45.000> out<00:02:45.209> the<00:02:45.360> back<00:02:45.540> now<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.500> thing<00:02:46.709> is

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
will take out the back now the thing is

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.440 
will take out the back now the thing is
I<00:02:47.040> don't<00:02:47.099> believe<00:02:47.519> you<00:02:47.700> actually<00:02:47.910> have<00:02:48.269> to

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
I don't believe you actually have to

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.180 
I don't believe you actually have to
have<00:02:48.660> a<00:02:48.870> ring<00:02:49.290> light<00:02:49.470> in<00:02:49.620> order<00:02:49.739> to<00:02:49.890> make<00:02:50.069> this

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
have a ring light in order to make this

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.460 
have a ring light in order to make this
work<00:02:50.250> if<00:02:50.610> you<00:02:50.730> just<00:02:51.000> have<00:02:51.239> a<00:02:51.450> couple<00:02:51.930> of<00:02:52.140> lamps

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
work if you just have a couple of lamps

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.320 
work if you just have a couple of lamps
sort<00:02:53.280> of<00:02:53.370> either<00:02:53.519> side<00:02:53.880> of<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.090> camera

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
sort of either side of the camera

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.559 
sort of either side of the camera
pointing<00:02:54.900> straight<00:02:55.170> at<00:02:55.500> you<00:02:55.980> I<00:02:56.250> think<00:02:57.060> you

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
pointing straight at you I think you

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.390 
pointing straight at you I think you
will<00:02:58.049> probably<00:02:58.080> be<00:02:58.590> able<00:02:58.680> to<00:02:58.799> get<00:02:58.980> away<00:02:59.069> with

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
will probably be able to get away with

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.920 
will probably be able to get away with
not<00:02:59.700> actually<00:03:00.150> having<00:03:00.299> to<00:03:00.450> build<00:03:00.569> a<00:03:00.750> ring

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
not actually having to build a ring

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.690 
not actually having to build a ring
light<00:03:01.170> to<00:03:01.709> make<00:03:01.860> it<00:03:02.010> work<00:03:02.160> but<00:03:02.310> obviously<00:03:02.640> a

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
light to make it work but obviously a

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.140 
light to make it work but obviously a
ring<00:03:02.910> light<00:03:03.090> will<00:03:03.319> will<00:03:04.549> you<00:03:05.549> know<00:03:05.670> is<00:03:05.880> the

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
ring light will will you know is the

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.089 
ring light will will you know is the
most<00:03:06.360> efficient<00:03:06.870> way<00:03:06.930> of<00:03:06.959> doing<00:03:07.110> it<00:03:07.500> so<00:03:07.680> that

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
most efficient way of doing it so that

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.009 
most efficient way of doing it so that
