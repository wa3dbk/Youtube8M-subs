00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
for instance on the volume knob you have

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:38.869 
for instance on the volume knob you have
a<00:00:29.279> very<00:00:29.609> warm<00:00:30.060> jazzy<00:00:30.900> tone<00:00:37.460> but<00:00:38.460> take<00:00:38.730> the

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
a very warm jazzy tone but take the

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.690 
a very warm jazzy tone but take the
