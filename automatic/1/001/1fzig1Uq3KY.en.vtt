00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:10.019
 but everyone 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.910
 so following my video that reaches 9 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.590
 but I have a lot of comments about it 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.660
 meaning you wanted to see how I 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.449
 done to get rid of the key of 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.670
 my acne scars so first of all 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.840
 I want to say that I always have 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.269
 the cone I still have scars 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.769
 it's just that it's alleviated so I 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.330
 will tell you how I did a 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.400
 little disc the mores if you have 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.650
 talked a lot about the skin problems of 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.329
 buttons go see a dermato to have 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.579
 maybe I'm not 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.469
 professional of course I leave you have 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.059
 just what worked with me so 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.180
 before starting there is a council that 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.920
 everyone should adapt that I 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.020
 does not apply at all because I do not 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.370
 not just happen then the 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.059
 advice is that you have to eat 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.760
 healthy 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.559
 I can not do it at all because 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.260
 the more you eat arms the more you go 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.809
 have buttons that will appear 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.840
 more eat sweet pimples do not go 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.809
 to be so short I do not do it because 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.270
 that the woman prevent from eating everything and 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.340
 anything at any time so I 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.170
 think it is a factor also 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.880
 buttons a few buttons etc 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.710
 you know I have to give you this 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.720
 really good maquis your skin to 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.610
 the end of the day 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:22.850
 use a gene and makeup with it 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.010
 our micellar and so on well spent 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.180
 especially the corners have a very skin 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.770
 clean and very clean 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.420
 before going to bed here are 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.040
 makeup is very important for the 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.760
 skin if you fall asleep with a powder 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.260
 room you're probably going and I can 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.479
 to be sure to wake up with a 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.340
 button so be a product that I you 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.760
 present now I used them 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.440
 in my video 4 and 9 may so if you 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.140
 want to go watch the video and pack 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:51.200
 info and on the screen do not hesitate then 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.610
 we started in the video gag at 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.790
 rhythms and people were wondering 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.890
 why I was only lemon juice 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.680
 so here's the beast actually it's juice 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.259
 pure lemon that I bought in 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.570
 supermarket so that's supposed to clear up 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:08.720
 our acne scars because the 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.380
 lemon it clears his whiteness between 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.720
 quotes the pigmentation of the skin 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.790
 because this time this short sarkozy 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.040
 understood so that's it for the 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.350
 acne scars to apply at night 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.290
 never apply it the day to that 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.269
 you expose to the sun daylight 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.549
 that it was a very well known that 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:31.100
 the lemon is really abrasive then 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:32.930
 I have pretty sensitive skin not too much 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.290
 sensitive I applied it all over the 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.269
 face 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.060
 it's hot for a second or two 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.530
 but after that it's this one 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.209
 of anything you are in me that I test 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.670
 that and that really decreases the 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.180
 pigmentation but aggressive tacheta 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.719
 or even pictures before after 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.299
 on the screen then there are some who say that 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:54.969
 lemon tightens pores too that I 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:56.799
 did not have any at all but hey there we are 

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:57.760
 talking about the gaps and so 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.129
 it is not very serious 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.650
 that was the main thing that 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:04.150
 I use then we will stay on 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.700
 scars and after I talk to him about the 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.859
 key then every night every night 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.799
 and sometimes in the morning if I remember 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:13.989
 in fact I use the facs their duo more 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:15.609
 of rock posed by these lensois 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.920
 corrective anti-imperfections 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:20.319
 deincrusting in team mark then that 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.169
 makes two promises uses and this at a 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.400
 rather special smell and I love 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:26.200
 the mouthpiece passing brief 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.680
 so that's it I like a lot but a 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.450
 every other day uses the video it for 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.030
 me it works I know it 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.500
 not work on everyone 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.569
 it smells essential success what me 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.250
 I draw it directly on my finger 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.109
 you can see it in my catane video 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.739
 of edf but here it works 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:43.659
 pretty good 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.909
 I used it every other day and when 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:48.459
 I do not use that I use a product 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:51.040
 that I had thanks to my dermato actually 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:55.090
 the effect berne 0 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.549
 05 without cream very tito in then he me 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.170
 said I had more scars than 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:01.269
 tak is actually so he just me 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.430
 prescribe that the only problem is that it 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:06.129
 dry the skin and it's disgusting 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.890
 so he told me if it got too 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:11.200
 abrasive I had to use it a mission 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.720
 two friends and that's just prescription 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.909
 then to standardize my face 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.810
 it's not for scars but for 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:18.639
 small redness 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.590
 I use the hanno che cream 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:22.810
 it's a moisturizer that you 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:26.650
 apply daily and it's up to 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:30.280
 salicylic acid and the world knows that 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:32.470
 salicylic acid is for deficiencies and 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.820
 the scars and so this is 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.800
 Fear I will then really you 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.110
 can find it on ebay amazon I 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.820
 think or else so let's go to the button 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.500
 and at the cnps and now what 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.690
 I use when I talk about buttons or 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.349
 to call I'm talking about a button that is 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.860
 embossed 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:51.130
 that's when you're in relief I got you 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.590
 never once a drop of tarbes title 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.810
 missed on my finger and I tap suez 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.729
 next day it's a little dry and so 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.560
 this is not miraculous but it helps 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:02.280
 what and of course is never pierced your 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.840
 buttons because they become inflated 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.550
 disgusting after and it's worse than the 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.250
 well so never drill your pimples 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.740
 then you still have noises of 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:14.590
 at my dermato it's the difference that 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.639
 is the freeze version and the crem version 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.699
 so what is it 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:21.460
 it's a cream that you apply the 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:24.940
 evening always on your buttons in relief 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.050
 and the next day that the cuttlefish and me the 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.639
 cream 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.919
 I prefer it to young people because the 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:32.080
 frost and the scene really really my 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:34.659
 skin but it is more effective the good ones 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.389
 after the next day as was made up 

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:39.400
 you have a big round dry site 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:41.650
 earlier as soon as so I prefer the 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.900
 cream that is less strong but that takes 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.460
 more time a treat the button so 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.349
 that's after it's like you want on 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:50.020
 prescription always from the dermato 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:53.020
 that's it and then the last product that 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:55.479
 I love who think they walk the 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:58.330
 better between all the products for the 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:06:01.659
 sheep that I have is the hac born fruit 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:03.580
 of a mediator weaves so that's it 

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:05.680
 do not find it on prescription me I them 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.229
 bought in the united states we can 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.990
 find on ebay and I believe that it is 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:12.729
 really really to decrease the volume 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:15.039
 of montbouton actually when he is in 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:17.169
 relief and marrow really 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:19.330
 diminished in size when I use that the 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:22.150
 evening after they also say it's 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.560
 for acne scars of the times I 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.569
 have learned that but it is quite abrasive 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.270
 because next day again 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:30.460
 problem is that it dries my skin and 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:33.099
 it's horrible so I prefer sometimes 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.050
 just to affix on a little button and 

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:36.849
 so here it is, it was really 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:39.400
 all for the video I hope that you 

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:40.690
 it rained and that it was re-read to you 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.849
 month in comment what are your 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:44.770
