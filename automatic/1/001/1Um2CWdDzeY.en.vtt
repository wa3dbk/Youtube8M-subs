00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:06.040
 a very good evening this weekend have around 40 companies and organizations 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.910
 municipalities and put the rope on the occasion of the first I feel 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.629
 suddenly every weekend 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:17.429
 because of the high energy prices, that green energy is on the rise in visitors 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:22.369
 were able to receive information about all possible forms of renewable energy and 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.170
 I had to take a stage and I was waiting for a visit to Twins Green 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:29.169
 energy companies in our region 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.370
 energy prices are swinging the pan, moreover, certain forms of 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.360
 dementia increasingly scarce 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.940
 the reason to organize the first green energy weekend 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.140
 comes with a suitcase and three a handshake and sense specialized in 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.550
 heating systems and stoves based on biomass in this case 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:49.850
 wooden pallets 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.600
 the wooden pallets are made from his story yet falls like the case 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.140
 mail or old can that could celeste reasonably 7 never 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.990
 so to speak, but pondered the upper pressure under sin 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.280
 that it is a very compact 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.180
 6 in Egyptian couples they are contained and that is a nice lake in middle chili 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.100
 then hear if you are taking the same direction 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.439
 it is no longer the latest news in the news 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.280
 the eco friendly they also notice that more and more people are knocking on the door 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.770
 looking for alternatives to the expensive energy prices 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.859
 yet the government will be able to do even more, it sounds here 

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:31.869
 to convince people of the importance of green energy our ship with 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.409
 relief supplies people turning point was not reality beyond that with that 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.970
 but in the government no distinction is made between renewable ones 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.260
 energy 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.500
 and therefore one 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.190
 yes the other 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.190
 rezai i know there will be a difference 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.590
 to promote renewable energy ecostream about funfair and in asia 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.300
 supplier specialized in photovoltaic solar energy systems 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.680
 the company belongs to the econcern group 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.250
 and employs 24 people 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.570
 Photovoltaic solar panels have been known for some time 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.230
 and that has clearly translated into the growing demand for more 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.099
 the interest by the public and also 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:14.729
 mainly by the 

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:18.689
 family is growing enormously and everyone with an effort 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:21.629
 what we can do to keep up with that question 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:27.090
 Ecostream felt that we were missing out on the energy weekend 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.520
 to open our door 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.110
 m but also to inform people of the possibilities that solar 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.410
 offer energy because today we have not signed any contracts that were 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.600
 not the intention it was only the intention to inform the people 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.430
 about how such systems work and how it works
