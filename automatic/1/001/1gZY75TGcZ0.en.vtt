00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
some whipping threads I would go to my

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.990 
some whipping threads I would go to my
working<00:00:46.050> thread<00:00:46.289> section<00:00:46.860> pull<00:00:47.820> out<00:00:47.910> the

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
working thread section pull out the

working thread section pull out the
whipping<00:00:48.270> threads<00:00:48.590> so<00:00:49.590> that's<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.340> first

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
whipping threads so that's the first

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.760 
whipping threads so that's the first
thing<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:50.820> would<00:00:50.940> say<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.210> have<00:00:51.809> something<00:00:52.260> set

advices that's one I've got setup which

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.460 
advices that's one I've got setup which
is<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.159> basic<00:01:23.549> vise<00:01:23.729> with<00:01:24.080> a<00:01:25.080> clamping

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
is a basic vise with a clamping

mechanism the front this one is another
basic<00:01:29.520> basic<00:01:30.180> advice<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.630> probably<00:01:31.079> as<00:01:31.229> simple

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
basic basic advice is probably as simple

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.770 
basic basic advice is probably as simple
as<00:01:31.650> you're<00:01:31.860> ever<00:01:32.009> going<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.310> find<00:01:32.369> it's<00:01:33.360> got<00:01:33.570> an

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
as you're ever going to find it's got an

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.960 
as you're ever going to find it's got an
adjuster<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.380> plant<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.130> tabletop<00:01:35.579> like

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
adjuster to plant to a tabletop like

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.149 
adjuster to plant to a tabletop like
I've<00:01:36.299> got<00:01:36.509> here<00:01:36.720> it's<00:01:37.320> got<00:01:37.439> an<00:01:37.530> adjuster<00:01:37.979> so

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
I've got here it's got an adjuster so

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.030 
I've got here it's got an adjuster so
you<00:01:38.220> can<00:01:38.570> slide<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.810> actual<00:01:40.200> vise<00:01:40.409> head<00:01:40.740> up

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
you can slide the actual vise head up

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.069 
you can slide the actual vise head up
and<00:01:41.220> down<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:42.090> it's<00:01:42.240> got<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.450> very<00:01:42.750> simple

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
and down and it's got a very simple

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.260 
and down and it's got a very simple
mechanism<00:01:43.549> for<00:01:44.549> tightening<00:01:45.439> flies<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:47.280> you

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
mechanism for tightening flies and you

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.460 
mechanism for tightening flies and you
can<00:01:48.390> see<00:01:48.600> there<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.810> just<00:01:49.049> tighten<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.380> up

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
can see there you just tighten that up

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.429 
can see there you just tighten that up
and<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.799> pushes<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.220> metal<00:01:50.490> together<00:01:50.840> so<00:01:51.840> you

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
and it pushes the metal together so you

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.859 
and it pushes the metal together so you
can<00:01:52.680> spend<00:01:53.040> anything<00:01:53.850> from<00:01:55.460> 10<00:01:56.460> pounds<00:01:56.700> or<00:01:57.090> $15

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
can spend anything from 10 pounds or $15

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.709 
can spend anything from 10 pounds or $15
to<00:01:58.799> probably<00:01:59.750> 150<00:02:00.750> pounds<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.640> $200<00:02:02.640> on<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:03.450> vise

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
to probably 150 pounds to $200 on a vise

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.810 
to probably 150 pounds to $200 on a vise
and<00:02:04.049> they<00:02:04.860> come<00:02:05.009> with<00:02:05.130> various<00:02:05.460> different

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
and they come with various different

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:06.870 
and they come with various different
things<00:02:06.090> they<00:02:06.329> come<00:02:06.509> with

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
things they come with

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.180 
things they come with
then<00:02:07.080> sections<00:02:08.080> underneath<00:02:08.319> ear<00:02:08.709> so<00:02:08.950> that<00:02:08.979> it

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190

them<00:04:11.440> because<00:04:11.620> no<00:04:11.859> doubt<00:04:12.069> in<00:04:12.280> a<00:04:12.730> few<00:04:13.180> months

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:13.359 
them because no doubt in a few months

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:16.229 
them because no doubt in a few months
time<00:04:13.630> you<00:04:13.870> will<00:04:13.989> end<00:04:14.109> up<00:04:14.260> wanting<00:04:15.130> to<00:04:15.519> increase

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
time you will end up wanting to increase

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
do the same things it's just when you

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.240 
do the same things it's just when you
get<00:04:28.570> a<00:04:28.630> little<00:04:28.690> bit<00:04:28.900> more<00:04:29.050> advanced<00:04:29.530> it's<00:04:30.070> a

lot<00:04:30.430> easier<00:04:30.640> to<00:04:30.880> do<00:04:31.150> the<00:04:31.270> trickier<00:04:31.690> work<00:04:31.930> and

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
lot easier to do the trickier work and

lot easier to do the trickier work and
if<00:04:32.380> you<00:04:32.440> spend<00:04:32.710> a<00:04:32.830> lot<00:04:32.980> of<00:04:33.010> time<00:04:33.280> time<00:04:33.550> time

you need well the most important thing
is<00:04:46.450> a<00:04:46.480> hawk<00:04:46.690> now<00:04:47.470> I<00:04:47.890> would<00:04:48.790> recommend<00:04:48.970> to

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
is a hawk now I would recommend to

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.800 
is a hawk now I would recommend to
everyone<00:04:50.050> who's<00:04:50.710> learning<00:04:51.340> to<00:04:51.430> tie<00:04:51.640> flies<00:04:51.910> is

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
everyone who's learning to tie flies is

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.470 
everyone who's learning to tie flies is
don't<00:04:53.440> get<00:04:53.650> don't<00:04:54.040> tie<00:04:54.370> a<00:04:54.400> fly<00:04:54.760> anything

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
don't get don't tie a fly anything

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.360 
don't get don't tie a fly anything
bigger<00:04:55.750> than<00:04:55.900> maybe<00:04:56.380> a<00:04:57.120> 12<00:04:58.200> I<00:04:59.200> would<00:05:00.100> even<00:05:00.250> go

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
bigger than maybe a 12 I would even go

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.640 
bigger than maybe a 12 I would even go
down<00:05:00.610> to<00:05:00.790> a<00:05:00.820> law<00:05:01.390> as<00:05:01.660> a<00:05:01.690> for<00:05:02.320> size<00:05:02.740> for<00:05:03.130> Hawk

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
down to a law as a for size for Hawk

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.080 
down to a law as a for size for Hawk
basically<00:05:05.650> just<00:05:05.800> so<00:05:05.950> you<00:05:06.010> can<00:05:06.250> see<00:05:06.610> how<00:05:06.880> you're

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
basically just so you can see how you're

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.570 
basically just so you can see how you're
getting<00:05:07.210> the<00:05:07.420> material<00:05:08.020> onto<00:05:08.500> the<00:05:08.770> pocket

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
getting the material onto the pocket

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.850 
getting the material onto the pocket
itself<00:05:09.850> if<00:05:10.540> you're<00:05:10.720> using<00:05:10.930> a<00:05:11.050> very<00:05:11.260> small<00:05:11.350> Hawk

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
itself if you're using a very small Hawk

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.730 
itself if you're using a very small Hawk
as<00:05:12.550> you<00:05:12.669> can<00:05:12.820> see<00:05:13.030> here<00:05:13.240> this<00:05:13.419> is<00:05:13.690> not<00:05:14.050> a<00:05:14.080> tiny<00:05:14.500> -

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
as you can see here this is not a tiny -

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.760 
as you can see here this is not a tiny -
analog<00:05:15.300> and<00:05:16.300> you<00:05:16.390> can<00:05:16.540> see<00:05:16.750> the<00:05:16.900> you<00:05:17.410> can<00:05:17.470> see

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
analog and you can see the you can see

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.490 
analog and you can see the you can see
the<00:05:17.970> line<00:05:18.970> going<00:05:19.390> on<00:05:19.540> there<00:05:19.750> and<00:05:19.960> it's<00:05:20.200> a<00:05:20.320> lot

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
the line going on there and it's a lot

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.900 
the line going on there and it's a lot
easier<00:05:21.480> to<00:05:22.950> see<00:05:23.950> the<00:05:24.040> material<00:05:24.430> going<00:05:24.550> up<00:05:24.730> onto

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
easier to see the material going up onto

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.850 
easier to see the material going up onto
the<00:05:25.120> hook<00:05:25.270> if<00:05:25.450> you've<00:05:25.660> got<00:05:25.810> a<00:05:25.840> bigger<00:05:26.080> a<00:05:26.350> bigger

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
the hook if you've got a bigger a bigger

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.820 
the hook if you've got a bigger a bigger
shank<00:05:27.220> to<00:05:27.400> work<00:05:27.580> with<00:05:28.169> you<00:05:29.169> can<00:05:29.200> end<00:05:29.440> up<00:05:29.500> signs

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
shank to work with you can end up signs

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.980 
shank to work with you can end up signs
as<00:05:30.160> 22s<00:05:30.730> like<00:05:30.910> I<00:05:30.940> said<00:05:31.180> some<00:05:31.390> of<00:05:31.419> these<00:05:31.600> their

as 22s like I said some of these their

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.370 
as 22s like I said some of these their
buzzers<00:05:32.440> in<00:05:32.560> here<00:05:32.860> they're<00:05:33.070> small<00:05:33.880> buzzers

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380

buzzers in here they're small buzzers
I've<00:05:35.380> got<00:05:35.530> some<00:05:35.770> dry<00:05:36.070> flies<00:05:36.400> over<00:05:36.790> here<00:05:36.970> that

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
I've got some dry flies over here that

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.740 
I've got some dry flies over here that
are<00:05:38.700> exceptionally<00:05:39.700> small<00:05:39.970> and<00:05:40.210> you<00:05:40.330> wouldn't

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
are exceptionally small and you wouldn't

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.680 
are exceptionally small and you wouldn't
really<00:05:40.990> want<00:05:41.169> to<00:05:42.000> transit<00:05:43.000> I<00:05:43.090> wanted<00:05:43.360> these<00:05:43.510> as

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
really want to transit I wanted these as

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.990 
really want to transit I wanted these as
you<00:05:43.810> first<00:05:44.050> fly<00:05:44.380> I<00:05:44.650> mean<00:05:45.310> look<00:05:45.490> at<00:05:45.580> the<00:05:45.669> size<00:05:45.880> of

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
you first fly I mean look at the size of

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.460 
you first fly I mean look at the size of
that<00:05:47.250> it's<00:05:48.250> difficult<00:05:48.820> to<00:05:49.240> even<00:05:49.540> see<00:05:50.110> to<00:05:50.380> be

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
that it's difficult to even see to be

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.950 
that it's difficult to even see to be
honest<00:05:50.740> so<00:05:51.070> imagine<00:05:52.030> trying<00:05:52.210> to<00:05:52.360> tie<00:05:52.479> that<00:05:52.720> and

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
honest so imagine trying to tie that and

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.040 
honest so imagine trying to tie that and
put<00:05:53.229> that<00:05:53.260> into<00:05:53.500> relation<00:05:53.979> to<00:05:54.160> the<00:05:54.280> other<00:05:54.729> hawk

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
put that into relation to the other hawk

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.390 
put that into relation to the other hawk
you<00:05:56.050> know<00:05:56.169> we're<00:05:56.380> talking<00:05:56.560> completely

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:45.420 
recommend you tie something that is

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.840 
recommend you tie something that is
quite<00:06:45.930> easy<00:06:46.230> to<00:06:46.380> do<00:06:46.650> and<00:06:47.250> something<00:06:47.700> that's

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:47.850 
quite easy to do and something that's

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.750 
quite easy to do and something that's
going<00:06:48.000> to<00:06:48.060> be<00:06:48.180> useful<00:06:48.390> I<00:06:48.840> will<00:06:49.470> try<00:06:49.800> a<00:06:50.070> wet<00:06:50.430> fly

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:50.760 
going to be useful I will try a wet fly

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.020 
going to be useful I will try a wet fly
first<00:06:51.210> I<00:06:51.630> will<00:06:52.350> try<00:06:52.530> and<00:06:52.920> I<00:06:52.980> would<00:06:53.130> get<00:06:53.400> maybe

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.030 
first I will try and I would get maybe

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:58.760 
first I will try and I would get maybe
some<00:06:54.510> sort<00:06:54.810> of<00:06:55.130> easy<00:06:56.130> Fritz<00:06:56.640> material<00:06:57.770> maybe

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:58.770 
some sort of easy Fritz material maybe

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.710 
some sort of easy Fritz material maybe
even<00:06:59.070> tie<00:06:59.250> a<00:06:59.280> law<00:06:59.610> with<00:06:59.850> the<00:06:59.940> Fritz<00:07:00.210> material

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720

even tie a law with the Fritz material
which<00:07:00.930> is<00:07:01.110> quite<00:07:01.380> godly<00:07:02.100> but<00:07:02.250> there's<00:07:02.910> a

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:02.970 
which is quite godly but there's a

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.330 
which is quite godly but there's a
couple<00:07:03.270> of<00:07:03.360> little<00:07:03.660> tricks<00:07:04.470> that<00:07:04.830> you<00:07:04.920> can<00:07:05.070> use

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:05.340 
couple of little tricks that you can use

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.340 
couple of little tricks that you can use
to<00:07:05.760> tie<00:07:06.480> these<00:07:06.540> in<00:07:06.870> there<00:07:06.990> and<00:07:07.110> they<00:07:07.200> look

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:07.350 
to tie these in there and they look

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:09.890 
to tie these in there and they look
really<00:07:07.620> good
