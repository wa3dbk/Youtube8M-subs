00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.580 
though so make sure to comment like this
video<00:03:08.870> and<00:03:09.640> actually<00:03:10.959> like<00:03:11.959> this<00:03:12.350> color

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
video and actually like this color

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:13.900 
video and actually like this color
correction<00:03:12.980> right<00:03:13.100> here<00:03:13.310> might<00:03:13.700> work<00:03:13.880> for

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
correction right here might work for

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.150 
correction right here might work for
this<00:03:14.240> map<00:03:14.510> but<00:03:15.170> say<00:03:15.380> I<00:03:15.410> had<00:03:15.590> a<00:03:15.650> different<00:03:15.980> map

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
this map but say I had a different map

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.220 
this map but say I had a different map
it<00:03:16.400> might<00:03:16.640> not<00:03:16.790> work<00:03:16.970> as<00:03:17.180> well<00:03:17.209> so<00:03:17.540> I'm<00:03:18.110> gonna

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
it might not work as well so I'm gonna

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.020 
it might not work as well so I'm gonna
show<00:03:18.410> you<00:03:18.470> how<00:03:18.680> to<00:03:18.739> do<00:03:18.890> it<00:03:19.010> on<00:03:19.100> another<00:03:19.130> map<00:03:19.670> too

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
show you how to do it on another map too

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.050 
show you how to do it on another map too
so<00:03:20.900> let's<00:03:21.230> get<00:03:21.410> a<00:03:21.440> kill<00:03:21.680> cam<00:03:21.890> clip<00:03:22.670> from

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
so let's get a kill cam clip from

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.729 
so let's get a kill cam clip from
another<00:03:23.510> map<00:03:23.720> this<00:03:23.930> one<00:03:24.140> is<00:03:24.260> actually<00:03:24.440> from

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
another map this one is actually from

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.100 
another map this one is actually from
favela<00:03:25.160> another<00:03:25.550> clip<00:03:25.760> from<00:03:25.970> clip<00:03:26.270> I've<00:03:26.450> and

favela another clip from clip I've and

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.780 
favela another clip from clip I've and
there's<00:03:27.590> no<00:03:27.800> color<00:03:28.070> correction<00:03:28.489> on<00:03:28.580> this

tones

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349 
tones

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:57.520 
tones
like<00:03:54.650> a<00:03:54.680> blueish<00:03:55.370> cyan<00:03:56.180> I<00:03:56.599> think<00:03:57.260> that<00:03:57.349> looks

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
like a blueish cyan I think that looks

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.199 
like a blueish cyan I think that looks
nice<00:03:57.680> right<00:03:57.829> there<00:03:57.980> mid-tones<00:03:58.790> you're<00:03:59.120> gonna

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
nice right there mid-tones you're gonna

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.089 
nice right there mid-tones you're gonna
want<00:03:59.510> to<00:03:59.569> go<00:03:59.719> cyan<00:04:00.109> or<00:04:00.140> blue<00:04:00.469> you<00:04:00.500> want<00:04:00.920> to<00:04:00.980> go<00:04:01.069> a

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
want to go cyan or blue you want to go a

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:02.289 
want to go cyan or blue you want to go a
little<00:04:01.159> less<00:04:01.519> on<00:04:01.700> this<00:04:01.819> map<00:04:02.060> because<00:04:02.180> it

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
little less on this map because it

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.929 
little less on this map because it
already<00:04:02.540> is<00:04:02.659> a<00:04:02.750> little<00:04:03.079> bit<00:04:03.170> blue<00:04:03.439> and<00:04:03.939> the

00:04:04.929 --> 00:04:04.939 
already is a little bit blue and the

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:08.080 
already is a little bit blue and the
highlights<00:04:05.620> definitely<00:04:06.620> go<00:04:06.859> or<00:04:07.129> a<00:04:07.189> yellow

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
highlights definitely go or a yellow

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.199 
highlights definitely go or a yellow
orange<00:04:08.599> I<00:04:09.500> think<00:04:10.489> that<00:04:10.790> looks<00:04:10.939> pretty<00:04:11.030> good

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
orange I think that looks pretty good

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.089 
orange I think that looks pretty good
right<00:04:11.510> there<00:04:11.540> let's<00:04:12.379> see<00:04:12.560> at<00:04:12.680> the<00:04:12.709> different

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
right there let's see at the different

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:15.459 
right there let's see at the different
points<00:04:13.280> in<00:04:13.549> this<00:04:13.819> video<00:04:14.180> if<00:04:14.450> that<00:04:14.840> is<00:04:15.170> an

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:15.469 
points in this video if that is an

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:17.920 
points in this video if that is an
appropriate<00:04:15.980> color<00:04:16.579> correction<00:04:17.329> and<00:04:17.539> it

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
appropriate color correction and it

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.879 
appropriate color correction and it
looks<00:04:18.199> pretty<00:04:18.829> good<00:04:19.639> to<00:04:20.000> me

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
looks pretty good to me

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.080 
looks pretty good to me
obviously<00:04:21.889> you<00:04:22.039> guys<00:04:22.160> can<00:04:22.460> change<00:04:22.729> that<00:04:22.940> if

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
obviously you guys can change that if

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.330 
obviously you guys can change that if
you<00:04:23.210> want<00:04:23.509> it's<00:04:24.410> not<00:04:24.620> too<00:04:24.830> much<00:04:25.009> of<00:04:25.130> a<00:04:25.190> color

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
you want it's not too much of a color

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.820 
you want it's not too much of a color
correction<00:04:25.669> but<00:04:26.060> it<00:04:26.240> works<00:04:26.509> as<00:04:26.780> you<00:04:27.229> can<00:04:27.410> see

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
correction but it works as you can see

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.010 
correction but it works as you can see
if<00:04:28.070> I<00:04:28.220> uncheck<00:04:28.400> that<00:04:28.699> that's<00:04:29.270> a<00:04:29.389> regular<00:04:29.539> video

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
if I uncheck that that's a regular video

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.040 
if I uncheck that that's a regular video
kind<00:04:30.349> of<00:04:30.470> faded<00:04:30.889> check<00:04:31.460> that<00:04:31.669> off<00:04:31.880> it<00:04:32.720> puts<00:04:32.960> a

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
kind of faded check that off it puts a

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.960 
kind of faded check that off it puts a
little<00:04:33.229> pop<00:04:33.410> in<00:04:33.440> it<00:04:33.830> these<00:04:34.520> highlights

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
little pop in it these highlights

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.810 
little pop in it these highlights
definitely<00:04:35.599> pop<00:04:35.840> out<00:04:36.110> a<00:04:36.139> lot<00:04:36.500> more<00:04:36.770> than<00:04:37.310> just

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
definitely pop out a lot more than just

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.930 
definitely pop out a lot more than just
the<00:04:37.940> regular<00:04:38.270> video<00:04:38.800> boom<00:04:39.800> and<00:04:40.310> that<00:04:40.820> looks

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
the regular video boom and that looks

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:41.589 
the regular video boom and that looks
pretty<00:04:41.000> good

00:04:41.589 --> 00:04:41.599 
pretty good

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:43.749 
pretty good
I<00:04:41.860> think<00:04:42.860> it<00:04:42.919> looks<00:04:43.070> pretty<00:04:43.190> good<00:04:43.460> I<00:04:43.490> won't

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:43.759
