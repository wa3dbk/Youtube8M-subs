 hector eyes to be carried out in the road race brothers brothers Rodriguez 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.250
 also put a privileged place to learn safe out of traffic 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.610
 new facilities first so your strategy are not several levels 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.660
 and even people who do not have a motorcycle can access this course 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.140
 that the idea is to create it motorcyclists in a culture conscience 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.250
 most responsible road we will have the women included in the course 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.820

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.869
 controls and the operation of dams 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.050
 identical a large motorcycle 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.520
 it was by the type of courses there two levels 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.939
 the zero level esp to people who do not have the experience do not know how to handle 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:42.550
 a motorcycle and never drive a motorcycle 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.180
 and ending the course ending the day 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.710
