00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.879
 such a finger thing 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.940
 this is caused due to an illness 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.949

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.350

 who was born and his hand was growing 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.290
 gradually until it came to 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:01.570
 acquire these enormous dimensions at 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.540
 final because his 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.729
 growth could be operable its 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.740
 illness and he was operated on by a group of 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.880
 about 20 surgeons in the hospital of 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.580

 there they brought them more than 5 kilos of 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.890
 tissue was useless to him 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.289
 they had to amputate some fingers and 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.509
 well nowadays it does not have anymore it does not have 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:24.580
 that monstrous hand but if it has 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:27.580
 some back problems derived 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.369
 of carrying a hand so heavy the fact 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.759
 of carrying a hand that weighed around 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:36.039
 5 or 6 kilos his whole life has made 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.320
 have the shoulder has done that right now 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:42.210
 you have to operate on your shoulder and have 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:45.690
 serious problems of incredible column no 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.460
 The fact is that this man could not 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.580
 be treated earlier because if the 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.200
 disease is growing is not a 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.690
 foolishness operate it because it will continue 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.119
 growing and growing so he had to 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.070
 wait for your hand to stop growing and 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.140
 was teased by a large 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.180
 number of people

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.800
 good hand is not a normal hand 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.709
