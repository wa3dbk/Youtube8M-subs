00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
politically and in dialogue with friends

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.700 
politically and in dialogue with friends
but<00:01:11.220> not<00:01:11.610> knowing<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:12.180> single<00:01:12.420> troop<00:01:12.869> when<00:01:13.680> I

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
but not knowing a single troop when I

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.590 
but not knowing a single troop when I
come<00:01:14.100> home<00:01:14.340> at<00:01:14.580> night<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.090> this<00:01:15.270> was<00:01:15.420> two

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
come home at night and this was two

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.450

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
years ago and I see that another

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.580
