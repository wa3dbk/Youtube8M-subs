00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.690 
you could calibrate it if you had a real
ruler<00:03:40.080> next<00:03:40.440> to<00:03:40.680> it<00:03:40.770> you<00:03:40.950> can<00:03:41.310> make<00:03:41.430> it<00:03:41.550> smaller

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
ruler next to it you can make it smaller

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.130 
ruler next to it you can make it smaller
make<00:03:42.360> bigger<00:03:43.580> as<00:03:44.580> obviously<00:03:45.140> this

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
make bigger as obviously this

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.840 
make bigger as obviously this
application<00:03:46.709> will<00:03:46.830> be<00:03:46.860> four<00:03:47.250> phones<00:03:47.670> of

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
application will be four phones of

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.830 
application will be four phones of
different<00:03:48.150> sizes<00:03:49.940> next<00:03:50.940> step<00:03:51.209> screen<00:03:51.660> light

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
different sizes next step screen light

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.390 
different sizes next step screen light
and<00:03:52.550> then<00:03:53.550> there<00:03:53.790> was<00:03:53.910> light<00:03:55.010> so<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.220> whole

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
and then there was light so the whole

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:05.160 
and then there was light so the whole
thing<00:03:56.930> have<00:03:57.930> me<00:03:58.140> add<00:03:59.209> and<00:04:00.209> stopwatch

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.190 

so<00:04:05.830> there<00:04:05.980> you<00:04:06.010> have<00:04:06.130> stopped<00:04:06.580> watch<00:04:07.200> chain

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
so there you have stopped watch chain

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.040 
so there you have stopped watch chain

the whole bill is 60 you set the
different<00:04:40.690> percentages<00:04:41.110> there

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370
