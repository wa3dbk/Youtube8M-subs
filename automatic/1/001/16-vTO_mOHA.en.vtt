00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
in this video video 11 will describe the

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.760 
in this video video 11 will describe the
cardiac<00:00:03.480> cycle<00:00:03.689> with<00:00:04.230> reference<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:04.620> the

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
cardiac cycle with reference to the

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.150 
cardiac cycle with reference to the
actions<00:00:05.100> of<00:00:05.190> the<00:00:05.879> valves<00:00:06.270> in<00:00:06.330> the<00:00:06.750> heart<00:00:07.130> so<00:00:08.130> I

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
actions of the valves in the heart so I

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.370 
actions of the valves in the heart so I
shouldn't<00:00:08.429> have<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.700> cardiac<00:00:09.090> cycle<00:00:09.300> is<00:00:09.690> the

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
shouldn't have the cardiac cycle is the

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.959 
shouldn't have the cardiac cycle is the
sequence<00:00:11.309> of<00:00:11.490> events<00:00:12.000> in<00:00:12.150> one<00:00:12.809> heartbeat<00:00:13.969> now

the blood filling phase with the heart
fills<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.240> blood<00:00:30.470> and<00:00:31.470> we'll<00:00:31.650> call<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:31.890> the

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
diastole now in this face over the atria

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.030 
diastole now in this face over the atria
at<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.120> top<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:37.410> ventricles<00:00:37.860> at<00:00:37.980> the

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
at the top and the ventricles at the

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.580 
at the top and the ventricles at the
bottom<00:00:38.309> relaxed<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.480> as<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.290> muscles

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
bottom relaxed and as the muscles

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.680 
bottom relaxed and as the muscles
relaxed<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.219> means<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.850> amount<00:00:42.510> of

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
relaxed it means that the amount of

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.209 
relaxed it means that the amount of
volume<00:00:42.899> in<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.110> heart<00:00:43.350> increases<00:00:43.800> because

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
volume in the heart increases because

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.819 
volume in the heart increases because
the<00:00:44.399> muscles<00:00:44.760> are<00:00:44.850> not<00:00:45.600> contracting<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.590> close

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
the muscles are not contracting to close

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.650 
the muscles are not contracting to close
the<00:00:46.950> heart<00:00:47.129> off<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.579> therefore<00:00:48.360> there's<00:00:48.510> more

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
the heart off and therefore there's more

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.290 
the heart off and therefore there's more
space<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.649> be<00:00:49.770> filled<00:00:49.950> so<00:00:50.879> there's<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.090> pressure

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
space to be filled so there's a pressure

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.930 
space to be filled so there's a pressure
drop<00:00:51.539> in<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.079> heart<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:53.160> pressure<00:00:53.370> the

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
drop in the heart and the pressure the

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.220 
drop in the heart and the pressure the
low<00:00:54.059> pressure<00:00:54.300> in<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.510> heart<00:00:54.690> means<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:55.170> the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
low pressure in the heart means that the

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.580 
low pressure in the heart means that the
blood<00:00:55.410> tends<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.829> come<00:00:56.010> from<00:00:57.020> the<00:00:58.020> major<00:00:58.230> veins

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
blood tends to come from the major veins

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.490 
blood tends to come from the major veins
and<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.460> blood<00:00:59.489> flows<00:00:59.910> into<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.600> atria<00:01:01.170> first

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
and the blood flows into the atria first

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.920 
and the blood flows into the atria first
and<00:01:01.770> then<00:01:02.420> through<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.539> open

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
and then through the open

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.500 
and then through the open
atrioventricular<00:01:04.379> valves<00:01:05.250> into<00:01:06.030> the

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
atrioventricular valves into the

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.330 
atrioventricular valves into the
ventricles

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
ventricles

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.850 
ventricles
now<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.400> valves<00:01:08.790> tend<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.119> work<00:01:09.409> by<00:01:10.409> opening

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
now the valves tend to work by opening

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.830 
now the valves tend to work by opening
because<00:01:11.310> there's<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.610> lower<00:01:11.820> pressure<00:01:12.119> in<00:01:12.450> the

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
because there's a lower pressure in the

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.359 
because there's a lower pressure in the
ventricles<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.530> there<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.799> atrium<00:01:14.189> and

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
ventricles and there is the atrium and

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.310 
ventricles and there is the atrium and
lower<00:01:15.090> ventured<00:01:15.509> low<00:01:15.900> pressure<00:01:16.140> in<00:01:16.229> the

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
lower ventured low pressure in the

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.890 
lower ventured low pressure in the
atrium<00:01:16.380> there<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.280> veins<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:18.240> due<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.750> the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
atrium there in the veins so due to the

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.899 
atrium there in the veins so due to the
fact<00:01:19.020> there's<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.259> lower<00:01:19.409> pressure<00:01:19.680> here<00:01:19.909> blood

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
fact there's a lower pressure here blood

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.420 
fact there's a lower pressure here blood
is<00:01:21.030> pushed<00:01:21.299> from<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.290> atria<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.400> the

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
is pushed from the atria to the

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.080 
is pushed from the atria to the
ventricles<00:01:23.780> pushing<00:01:24.780> past<00:01:25.020> those<00:01:25.590> valves<00:01:26.090> so

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
ventricles pushing past those valves so

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.910 
ventricles pushing past those valves so
the<00:01:27.180> diastole<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:27.689> simply<00:01:28.140> when<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.350> heart<00:01:28.590> or

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
the diastole is simply when the heart or

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.770 
the diastole is simply when the heart or
the<00:01:29.250> atria<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.610> ventricles<00:01:29.700> are<00:01:30.270> relaxing

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
the atria and ventricles are relaxing

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.749 
the atria and ventricles are relaxing
which<00:01:31.229> allows<00:01:31.530> blood<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:31.950> fill<00:01:32.460> both<00:01:32.700> the

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
which allows blood to fill both the

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.569 
which allows blood to fill both the
atria<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.390> ventricles<00:01:35.119> now<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.180> next

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
atria and the ventricles now the next

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:40.789 
atria and the ventricles now the next
stage<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.119> cardiac<00:01:39.420> cycle<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:40.049> called<00:01:40.710> the

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
stage of the cardiac cycle is called the

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.389 
stage of the cardiac cycle is called the
atrial<00:01:41.450> systole<00:01:43.549> so<00:01:44.549> in<00:01:44.610> this<00:01:44.700> stage<00:01:44.970> the

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
atrial systole so in this stage the

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.550 
atrial systole so in this stage the
atria<00:01:47.399> contract<00:01:47.810> and<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:49.020> small<00:01:49.320> pressure

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
atria contract and that small pressure

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.200 
atria contract and that small pressure
difference

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
difference

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.310 
difference
the<00:01:51.210> high<00:01:51.360> pressure<00:01:51.570> nature<00:01:52.049> of<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.170> lower

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
the high pressure nature of the lower

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.080 
the high pressure nature of the lower
pressure<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.799> ventricles<00:01:53.220> forces<00:01:53.970> even

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
pressure and the ventricles forces even

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.109 
pressure and the ventricles forces even
more<00:01:54.360> blood<00:01:54.630> through<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:56.119> atrioventricular

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
more blood through the atrioventricular

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.389 
more blood through the atrioventricular
valves<00:01:57.869> into<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.710> ventricles<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.250> what

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
valves into the ventricles and what

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.160 
valves into the ventricles and what
happens<00:01:59.670> is<00:01:59.820> this<00:02:00.360> pushes<00:02:00.780> against<00:02:00.990> the

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
happens is this pushes against the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.859 
happens is this pushes against the
outside<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.520> ventricular<00:02:02.759> wall<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.420> it

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
outside of the ventricular wall and it

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.230 
outside of the ventricular wall and it
stretches<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:05.159> allow<00:02:05.340> even<00:02:05.670> more<00:02:05.880> blood<00:02:06.119> to

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
stretches it to allow even more blood to

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.969 
stretches it to allow even more blood to
be<00:02:06.329> packed<00:02:06.570> in<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:07.290> those<00:02:07.380> ventricles<00:02:07.890> to

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
be packed in to those ventricles to

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.830 
be packed in to those ventricles to
ensure<00:02:08.399> there's<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:08.970> full<00:02:09.239> amount<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.660> blood

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
ensure there's a full amount of blood

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.780 
ensure there's a full amount of blood
there<00:02:10.430> now<00:02:11.430> eventually<00:02:11.640> the

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
there now eventually the

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.009 
there now eventually the
the<00:02:12.849> pressure<00:02:13.090> inside<00:02:13.299> the<00:02:13.480> ventricles

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
the pressure inside the ventricles

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.559 
the pressure inside the ventricles
exceeds<00:02:14.469> the<00:02:14.620> atria<00:02:14.980> and<00:02:15.129> blood<00:02:15.790> attempts<00:02:16.269> to

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
exceeds the atria and blood attempts to

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.929 
exceeds the atria and blood attempts to
flow<00:02:16.750> backwards<00:02:17.019> but<00:02:17.920> as<00:02:18.040> this<00:02:18.189> happens<00:02:18.609> the

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:18.939 
flow backwards but as this happens the

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:21.899 
flow backwards but as this happens the
blood<00:02:19.120> flows<00:02:19.420> into<00:02:19.689> the<00:02:19.900> pockets<00:02:20.290> near<00:02:21.280> the

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
blood flows into the pockets near the

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.240 
blood flows into the pockets near the
valves<00:02:22.269> and<00:02:22.510> that<00:02:23.140> causes<00:02:23.409> the<00:02:23.620> valve<00:02:23.799> to<00:02:24.010> snap

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
valves and that causes the valve to snap

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.780 
valves and that causes the valve to snap
shut

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
shut

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.080 
shut
so<00:02:25.510> that<00:02:26.609> increase<00:02:27.609> of<00:02:27.760> pressure<00:02:27.969> in<00:02:28.060> the

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
so that increase of pressure in the

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.819 
so that increase of pressure in the
ventricles<00:02:28.540> causes<00:02:29.319> the<00:02:29.409> atrioventricular

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:29.829 
ventricles causes the atrioventricular

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:32.520 
ventricles causes the atrioventricular
valves<00:02:30.519> to<00:02:30.609> eventually<00:02:31.000> closed<00:02:31.599> once<00:02:32.349> the

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
valves to eventually closed once the

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.589 
valves to eventually closed once the
ventricles<00:02:32.890> are<00:02:32.950> full<00:02:33.129> of<00:02:33.400> blood<00:02:33.640> so<00:02:34.480> that

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
ventricles are full of blood so that

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:37.520 
ventricles are full of blood so that
atrial<00:02:34.989> contraction<00:02:35.560> or<00:02:35.739> atrial<00:02:36.159> systole

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
atrial contraction or atrial systole

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.890 
atrial contraction or atrial systole
causes<00:02:38.530> ventricles<00:02:38.980> to<00:02:39.010> fill<00:02:39.099> of<00:02:39.280> blood<00:02:39.900> now

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
causes ventricles to fill of blood now

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.140 
causes ventricles to fill of blood now
the<00:02:40.959> next<00:02:41.230> stage<00:02:41.439> is<00:02:42.159> the<00:02:42.760> ventricular

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
the next stage is the ventricular

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.949 
the next stage is the ventricular
systole<00:02:43.689> and<00:02:44.280> during<00:02:45.280> this<00:02:45.430> well<00:02:46.090> before<00:02:46.629> this

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
systole and during this well before this

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.470 
systole and during this well before this
contraction<00:02:47.470> happens<00:02:47.829> all<00:02:48.280> four<00:02:49.030> valves<00:02:49.389> are

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
contraction happens all four valves are

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.629 
contraction happens all four valves are
closed<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:50.290> atrioventricular<00:02:50.919> valves

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:51.639 
closed the atrioventricular valves

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:56.360 
closed the atrioventricular valves
closed<00:02:51.909> to<00:02:52.480> prevent<00:02:52.629> backflow<00:02:52.989> and<00:02:53.519> the

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
closed to prevent backflow and the

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.580 
closed to prevent backflow and the
valves<00:02:57.370> in<00:02:57.549> the<00:02:57.579> aorta<00:02:58.120> and<00:02:58.269> so<00:02:59.260> on<00:02:59.409> the

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
valves in the aorta and so on the

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.920 
valves in the aorta and so on the
semilunar<00:02:59.889> valves<00:03:00.430> are<00:03:00.609> also<00:03:01.090> closed<00:03:01.419> and

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
semilunar valves are also closed and

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.199 
semilunar valves are also closed and
this<00:03:02.049> increased<00:03:02.409> pressure<00:03:02.500> and<00:03:03.159> then<00:03:04.030> what

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
this increased pressure and then what

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.390 
this increased pressure and then what
happens<00:03:04.480> is<00:03:04.599> the<00:03:04.810> ventricles<00:03:05.739> starts

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
happens is the ventricles starts

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.589 
happens is the ventricles starts
contract<00:03:06.790> it's<00:03:07.120> in<00:03:07.209> that<00:03:07.299> simultaneously

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
contract it's in that simultaneously

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.140 
contract it's in that simultaneously
they<00:03:08.470> both<00:03:08.650> contract<00:03:09.069> very<00:03:09.220> strongly<00:03:09.549> and<00:03:10.030> by

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
they both contract very strongly and by

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.179 
they both contract very strongly and by
this<00:03:10.209> stage<00:03:10.510> the<00:03:11.319> blood<00:03:11.470> can't<00:03:11.769> go<00:03:11.889> anywhere

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:12.189 
this stage the blood can't go anywhere

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:14.539 
this stage the blood can't go anywhere
because<00:03:12.280> it<00:03:12.519> can't<00:03:12.700> go<00:03:12.849> through<00:03:13.510> back<00:03:13.780> to<00:03:13.810> the

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
because it can't go through back to the

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.770 
because it can't go through back to the
atrium<00:03:15.549> because<00:03:15.760> of<00:03:16.060> the<00:03:16.180> valves<00:03:16.510> are<00:03:16.599> closed

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
atrium because of the valves are closed

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.509 
atrium because of the valves are closed
and<00:03:17.290> it<00:03:17.440> can't<00:03:17.680> really<00:03:17.859> flow<00:03:18.129> of<00:03:18.190> the<00:03:18.310> heart

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
and it can't really flow of the heart

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.420 
and it can't really flow of the heart
straight<00:03:18.760> away<00:03:18.970> because<00:03:19.389> the<00:03:19.750> semilunar

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
straight away because the semilunar

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.250 
straight away because the semilunar
valves<00:03:21.430> also<00:03:21.729> closed<00:03:22.000> so<00:03:22.690> the<00:03:22.810> pressure

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
valves also closed so the pressure

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.659 
valves also closed so the pressure
builds<00:03:23.650> up<00:03:23.769> and<00:03:23.919> when<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.069> pressure<00:03:24.280> exceeds

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:24.669 
builds up and when the pressure exceeds

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:29.729 
builds up and when the pressure exceeds
the<00:03:25.510> pressure<00:03:25.780> in<00:03:26.079> the<00:03:27.659> main<00:03:28.659> veins<00:03:28.930> then<00:03:29.590> what

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
the pressure in the main veins then what

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.189 
the pressure in the main veins then what
happens<00:03:30.010> is<00:03:30.159> suddenly<00:03:30.790> the<00:03:31.510> semilunar<00:03:31.810> valves

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:32.199 
happens is suddenly the semilunar valves

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:34.920 
happens is suddenly the semilunar valves
open<00:03:32.979> up<00:03:33.099> and<00:03:33.280> it<00:03:33.760> shoots<00:03:34.150> blood<00:03:34.389> of<00:03:34.540> spurts

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
open up and it shoots blood of spurts

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.140 
open up and it shoots blood of spurts
blood<00:03:35.199> on<00:03:35.290> a<00:03:35.349> very<00:03:35.590> high<00:03:35.739> pressure<00:03:36.010> out<00:03:36.310> of<00:03:37.030> the

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:40.479 
Hopf now this diagram for the textbook

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:42.030 
Hopf now this diagram for the textbook
shows<00:03:40.870> you<00:03:41.079> quite<00:03:41.379> clearly<00:03:41.680> how<00:03:41.979> the

shows you quite clearly how the
atrioventricular<00:03:42.609> valves<00:03:43.389> work<00:03:43.599> as<00:03:43.870> we

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
atrioventricular valves work as we

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.129 
atrioventricular valves work as we
explained<00:03:44.739> earlier<00:03:44.889> but<00:03:45.519> in<00:03:45.639> more<00:03:45.760> detail<00:03:46.180> so

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:47.139 
explained earlier but in more detail so

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:49.050 
explained earlier but in more detail so
there<00:03:47.260> are<00:03:47.319> two<00:03:47.470> diagrams<00:03:47.889> first<00:03:48.190> of<00:03:48.340> all<00:03:48.459> when

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
there are two diagrams first of all when

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.729 
there are two diagrams first of all when
the<00:03:49.150> valve<00:03:49.329> is<00:03:49.479> open<00:03:49.810> and<00:03:50.260> secondly<00:03:50.530> when<00:03:50.680> the

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
the valve is open and secondly when the

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.339 
the valve is open and secondly when the
valve<00:03:50.889> is<00:03:50.979> closed<00:03:51.250> now<00:03:51.609> quite<00:03:52.569> clearly<00:03:52.870> we<00:03:53.139> see

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 
valve is closed now quite clearly we see

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:55.409 
valve is closed now quite clearly we see
the<00:03:53.500> atria<00:03:54.010> at<00:03:54.190> the<00:03:54.280> top<00:03:54.459> the<00:03:54.970> vent<00:03:55.150> cord<00:03:55.359> the

the atria at the top the vent cord the

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:59.490 
the atria at the top the vent cord the
bottom<00:03:56.310> and<00:03:57.629> the<00:03:58.629> valve<00:03:58.810> opens<00:03:59.229> when<00:03:59.470> the

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
bottom and the valve opens when the

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.649 
bottom and the valve opens when the
atria<00:04:00.040> contracts<00:04:00.579> and<00:04:00.729> that<00:04:01.120> increases

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:01.659 
atria contracts and that increases

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:03.659 
atria contracts and that increases
pressure<00:04:01.900> the<00:04:02.049> top<00:04:02.310> decreases<00:04:03.310> the<00:04:03.400> bottom

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:03.669 
pressure the top decreases the bottom

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:06.960 
pressure the top decreases the bottom
and<00:04:03.939> forces<00:04:04.599> blood<00:04:04.870> through<00:04:05.430> to<00:04:06.430> push<00:04:06.579> against

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
and forces blood through to push against

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.949 
and forces blood through to push against
the<00:04:08.129> valve<00:04:09.129> and<00:04:09.370> of<00:04:10.150> course<00:04:10.389> this<00:04:10.569> opens<00:04:10.900> the

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
the valve and of course this opens the

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.240 
the valve and of course this opens the
valve<00:04:11.169> up<00:04:11.379> and<00:04:11.620> allows<00:04:11.799> blood<00:04:12.040> to<00:04:12.159> flow

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
valve up and allows blood to flow

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.119 
valve up and allows blood to flow
through<00:04:12.489> oh<00:04:13.199> you<00:04:14.199> see<00:04:14.349> it's<00:04:14.739> basically<00:04:15.009> a

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:15.129 
through oh you see it's basically a

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:16.740 
through oh you see it's basically a
one-way<00:04:15.340> door<00:04:15.729> due<00:04:16.120> to<00:04:16.209> the<00:04:16.329> shape<00:04:16.479> of<00:04:16.659> the

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
one-way door due to the shape of the

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.360 
one-way door due to the shape of the
valve<00:04:16.959> and<00:04:17.229> the<00:04:17.409> way<00:04:17.530> that's<00:04:17.709> connected<00:04:18.159> to

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
valve and the way that's connected to

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.149 
valve and the way that's connected to
the<00:04:19.090> muscle<00:04:19.479> the<00:04:19.539> ventricle<00:04:19.900> wall<00:04:20.019> this<00:04:20.709> stops

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:21.159 
the muscle the ventricle wall this stops

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:24.060 
the muscle the ventricle wall this stops
the<00:04:21.430> valves<00:04:21.880> from<00:04:22.020> moving<00:04:23.020> in<00:04:23.710> a<00:04:23.950> direction

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
the valves from moving in a direction

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.370 
the valves from moving in a direction
that<00:04:24.370> allows<00:04:24.669> blood<00:04:24.849> to<00:04:24.909> go<00:04:25.029> backwards<00:04:25.389> now

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
that allows blood to go backwards now

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.610 
that allows blood to go backwards now
the<00:04:26.500> valve<00:04:26.680> closes<00:04:27.100> that's<00:04:27.250> what<00:04:27.340> happens

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
the valve closes that's what happens

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.660 
the valve closes that's what happens
there's<00:04:29.620> a<00:04:29.680> low<00:04:29.830> pressure<00:04:30.010> in<00:04:30.190> the<00:04:30.280> in<00:04:30.550> the

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
there's a low pressure in the in the

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.370 
there's a low pressure in the in the
atria<00:04:31.000> because<00:04:31.150> they've<00:04:31.240> relaxed<00:04:31.630> if<00:04:31.810> the

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
atria because they've relaxed if the

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.130 
atria because they've relaxed if the
ventricles<00:04:32.830> contracts<00:04:33.340> or<00:04:33.910> even<00:04:34.630> if<00:04:34.720> blood<00:04:34.870> is

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
ventricles contracts or even if blood is

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.190 
ventricles contracts or even if blood is
increased<00:04:35.800> in<00:04:35.950> the<00:04:36.010> ventricles<00:04:36.960> the<00:04:37.960> blood

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
increased in the ventricles the blood

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.420 
increased in the ventricles the blood
pushes<00:04:38.970> under<00:04:39.970> high<00:04:40.090> pressure<00:04:40.710> against<00:04:41.710> the

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
pushes under high pressure against the

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.890 
pushes under high pressure against the
pocket<00:04:42.970> of<00:04:43.710> the<00:04:44.710> valve<00:04:44.890> and<00:04:45.390> this<00:04:46.390> forces<00:04:46.780> the

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
pocket of the valve and this forces the

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.230 
pocket of the valve and this forces the
valve<00:04:47.020> backwards<00:04:47.530> to<00:04:48.280> close<00:04:48.550> the<00:04:48.730> valves<00:04:49.060> and

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
valve backwards to close the valves and

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.850 
valve backwards to close the valves and
that<00:04:49.900> means<00:04:50.080> that<00:04:50.260> the<00:04:50.320> blood<00:04:50.470> can't<00:04:50.770> flow

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
that means that the blood can't flow

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.760 
that means that the blood can't flow
into<00:04:51.550> the<00:04:51.670> atrium<00:04:52.390> so<00:04:53.200> that's<00:04:53.380> because<00:04:53.650> the

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
into the atrium so that's because the

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.740 
into the atrium so that's because the
increased<00:04:54.130> pressure<00:04:54.430> in<00:04:54.730> the<00:04:54.970> ventricles<00:04:55.510> and

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
increased pressure in the ventricles and

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.210 
increased pressure in the ventricles and
the<00:04:55.840> decreased<00:04:56.770> pressure<00:04:56.920> in<00:04:57.070> the<00:04:57.130> atrium

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
the decreased pressure in the atrium

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.130 
the decreased pressure in the atrium
which<00:04:57.970> means<00:04:58.210> blood<00:04:58.480> tries<00:04:58.840> to<00:04:58.960> flow

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
which means blood tries to flow

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.200 
which means blood tries to flow
backwards<00:04:59.320> but<00:04:59.680> by<00:04:59.860> doing<00:04:59.920> so<00:05:00.220> it<00:05:00.850> pushes

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
backwards but by doing so it pushes

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.150 
backwards but by doing so it pushes
against<00:05:01.540> the<00:05:01.690> valve<00:05:01.900> pocket<00:05:02.320> and<00:05:02.560> therefore

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
against the valve pocket and therefore

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.060 
against the valve pocket and therefore
closes<00:05:03.520> the<00:05:03.580> valve<00:05:03.760> up<00:05:04.080> so<00:05:05.080> this<00:05:05.230> basically

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
closes the valve up so this basically

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.140 
closes the valve up so this basically
keeps<00:05:06.250> the<00:05:06.370> blood<00:05:06.520> flowing<00:05:06.880> in<00:05:06.970> one<00:05:07.000> direction

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
keeps the blood flowing in one direction

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.760 
keeps the blood flowing in one direction
it<00:05:07.600> keeps<00:05:07.780> the<00:05:07.870> blood<00:05:07.990> of<00:05:08.110> going<00:05:08.260> from<00:05:08.380> atria

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
it keeps the blood of going from atria

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.440 
it keeps the blood of going from atria
ventricle<00:05:08.860> and<00:05:09.400> not<00:05:09.820> backwards<00:05:10.240> and

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
ventricle and not backwards and

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.630 
ventricle and not backwards and
therefore<00:05:11.200> increases<00:05:12.070> the<00:05:12.160> efficiency<00:05:12.340> of

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640 
therefore increases the efficiency of

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.300 
therefore increases the efficiency of
the<00:05:12.760> pump<00:05:12.970> of<00:05:13.060> the<00:05:13.150> heart<00:05:13.330> and<00:05:13.540> prevents

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
the pump of the heart and prevents

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.880 
the pump of the heart and prevents
backflow<00:05:15.310> of<00:05:15.730> blood<00:05:15.850> which<00:05:16.330> could<00:05:16.570> be

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890 
backflow of blood which could be

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.340 
backflow of blood which could be
dangerous<00:05:17.890> or<00:05:18.070> even<00:05:18.370> life-threatening<00:05:19.350> so

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350 
dangerous or even life-threatening so

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.140 
dangerous or even life-threatening so
you<00:05:20.410> should<00:05:20.560> be<00:05:20.620> able<00:05:20.680> to<00:05:20.770> explain<00:05:21.310> or

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
you should be able to explain or

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.780 
you should be able to explain or
describe<00:05:22.330> at<00:05:22.690> least<00:05:22.810> the<00:05:23.020> cardiac<00:05:23.350> cycle<00:05:23.790> by

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
describe at least the cardiac cycle by

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.700 
describe at least the cardiac cycle by
breaking<00:05:25.150> it<00:05:25.210> down<00:05:25.300> to<00:05:25.360> three<00:05:25.660> steps<00:05:25.900> which

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
breaking it down to three steps which

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.940 
breaking it down to three steps which
would<00:05:26.830> be<00:05:27.240> diastole<00:05:28.240> where<00:05:28.990> the<00:05:29.380> atrium<00:05:29.830> and

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
would be diastole where the atrium and

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.450 
would be diastole where the atrium and
the<00:05:30.100> ventricles<00:05:30.580> are<00:05:30.820> both<00:05:31.240> relaxed<00:05:32.460> atrial

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
the ventricles are both relaxed atrial

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.300 
the ventricles are both relaxed atrial
systole<00:05:34.030> with<00:05:34.420> the<00:05:34.510> atrium<00:05:35.040> contract<00:05:36.040> to<00:05:36.160> push

remember that in those three stages the

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.710 
remember that in those three stages the
valves<00:05:46.900> do<00:05:47.080> different<00:05:47.440> things<00:05:47.610> and<00:05:48.610> they<00:05:49.450> open

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 
valves do different things and they open

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.220 
valves do different things and they open
or<00:05:49.810> closed<00:05:50.020> depending<00:05:50.260> on<00:05:50.740> the<00:05:51.190> pressure<00:05:51.490> in

blackback<00:05:56.740> flow<00:05:57.010> and<00:05:57.250> you<00:05:57.700> should<00:05:57.880> really

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
blackback flow and you should really

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.240 
blackback flow and you should really
understand<00:05:58.720> and<00:05:58.870> explain<00:05:59.260> how<00:05:59.920> the<00:05:59.980> valves

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
understand and explain how the valves

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.700 
understand and explain how the valves
operate<00:06:00.640> based<00:06:00.820> on<00:06:01.270> this<00:06:01.360> video<00:06:01.510> I<00:06:01.870> would

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
operate based on this video I would

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.030 
operate based on this video I would
advise<00:06:03.190> you<00:06:03.430> to<00:06:03.640> look<00:06:04.330> at<00:06:04.480> an<00:06:04.600> animation

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:05.040 
advise you to look at an animation

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.280 
advise you to look at an animation
online<00:06:06.040> of<00:06:06.280> a<00:06:06.730> heart<00:06:06.910> beat<00:06:07.090> so<00:06:07.600> you<00:06:07.690> can<00:06:07.810> see<00:06:08.050> in

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:08.290 
online of a heart beat so you can see in

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:11.910 
online of a heart beat so you can see in
3d<00:06:08.680> or<00:06:08.830> 2d<00:06:08.950> at<00:06:09.370> least<00:06:09.720> the<00:06:10.720> way<00:06:10.900> in<00:06:11.050> which<00:06:11.230> the

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:11.920 
3d or 2d at least the way in which the

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.050 
3d or 2d at least the way in which the
heart<00:06:12.130> beats<00:06:12.190> and<00:06:12.520> the<00:06:12.610> way<00:06:12.730> in<00:06:12.820> which<00:06:12.910> the

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060 
heart beats and the way in which the

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.990 
heart beats and the way in which the
valves<00:06:13.360> interact<00:06:13.810> I<00:06:14.280> would<00:06:15.280> also<00:06:15.430> advise<00:06:15.850> you

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 
valves interact I would also advise you

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.630 
valves interact I would also advise you
to<00:06:16.120> remember<00:06:16.390> that<00:06:17.020> systole<00:06:17.590> is<00:06:17.740> the<00:06:18.340> period

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:18.640 
to remember that systole is the period

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.000 
to remember that systole is the period
of<00:06:18.700> contraction<00:06:19.300> and<00:06:19.510> diastole<00:06:20.380> is<00:06:20.620> the

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.010 
of contraction and diastole is the

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:22.230 
of contraction and diastole is the
period<00:06:21.280> of<00:06:21.340> relaxation<00:06:21.520> in<00:06:21.970> the<00:06:22.000> heart

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 
period of relaxation in the heart

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.120 
period of relaxation in the heart
because<00:06:22.900> it<00:06:23.020> will<00:06:23.170> come<00:06:23.290> up<00:06:23.350> again<00:06:23.440> later<00:06:23.770> in

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.130 
because it will come up again later in

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.610 
because it will come up again later in
another<00:06:24.430> topic
