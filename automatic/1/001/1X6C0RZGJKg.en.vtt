00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:33.280
 Let's do the post 0 we'll need 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.710
 two pieces of one-meter 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.040
 forty in length for more or 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.890
 less 65 71 already ensures 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:46.180
 can be two different seat fabrics 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:48.430
 doing or like I'm wearing mesh 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.220
 always remembering that the right side of the 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.379
 fabric there, he has to put the 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.210
 two games is what is new to the college entrance examination 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.449
 outside to pass a seam 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.449
 on here 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:20.080
 after sewing let's fold in half 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:24.369
 to make the cut of always remembering 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:31.390
 to hit the fabric did not vote wrong 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:35.280
 now let's make the medium again not 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.280
 There is a soldier problem that will cut 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:41.310
 now let's make our measure let's go 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.310
 take our measure 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.810
 here we will put my measure 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.240
 we asked on the shoulder and on the hip the 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.040
 I'll post it with mine in the case of 60 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.530
 However the placing more centimeters 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.770
 two cents per stitch and here we 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.150
 we put three centimeters more and 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.150
 Let's cut it like this 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:22.090
 so cut it now let's untap the 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:24.730
 tissue generated if you want you 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.190
 You can thread a stitch here to give 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.740
 more firmness the classic but it is optional 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.260
 if you want this is normal 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.780
 after sewing you go from dallas 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:39.270
 or with the side you want 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:41.850
 stand by and pass a seam here 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:45.550
 we passed the seam 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:48.640
 I advise you in this step is to vibrate 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.739
 links already tested on the baby and can be 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.690
 that it gets too big and if it gets 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:56.350
 big time to fix by passing 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:59.590
 another position that cutting the rest already 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:02.830
 has been tested I want to cut debonded 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:06.880
 and untapped bird and will come on the other side will 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.950
 make the French sheath go in touch 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.290
 Let's make the French sheath remember. 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.110
 who is on the bay side is here 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.180
 Inside the sewing we 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.040
 have to be careful to stay hem 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.390
 inside we do not pass stitching 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.380
 A lot of people here will not stay 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.380
 showing our side 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:36.330
 the seam now let's tell what 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:56.760
 our link is ready, just double it 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:59.670
 do not read it is ready it is ready the free 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.900
 We can walk on a saints only. 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.260
 free 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.210
 I spent about fifteen reais and 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:09.710
 to shop around with more cards in 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.710
 do at home such
