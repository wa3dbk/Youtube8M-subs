team<00:03:26.060> of<00:03:26.150> the<00:03:26.209> week<00:03:26.299> that'd<00:03:26.510> be<00:03:26.660> really<00:03:26.840> cool

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
team of the week that'd be really cool

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.430 
team of the week that'd be really cool
Briere<00:03:28.220> Bertuzzi<00:03:28.640> and<00:03:28.850> green<00:03:29.410> that'd<00:03:30.410> be

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
Briere Bertuzzi and green that'd be

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.990 
Briere Bertuzzi and green that'd be
really<00:03:30.739> sick<00:03:31.100> but<00:03:31.310> it's<00:03:31.579> hard<00:03:31.760> to<00:03:31.790> get<00:03:31.880> the

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
really sick but it's hard to get the

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.660 
really sick but it's hard to get the
rates<00:03:32.269> i<00:03:32.480> think<00:03:32.750> so<00:03:33.170> that's<00:03:33.410> why<00:03:34.370> they<00:03:34.489> don't

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
rates i think so that's why they don't

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.479 
rates i think so that's why they don't
do<00:03:34.850> it<00:03:34.970> but<00:03:35.120> if<00:03:35.239> they<00:03:35.390> could<00:03:35.540> like<00:03:35.690> maybe<00:03:36.680> get

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
do it but if they could like maybe get

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.759 
do it but if they could like maybe get
some<00:03:37.790> ones<00:03:37.940> right<00:03:38.150> somehow<00:03:38.510> or<00:03:39.079> put<00:03:39.470> out<00:03:39.500> like

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
some ones right somehow or put out like

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.630 
some ones right somehow or put out like
a<00:03:40.600> like<00:03:41.600> a<00:03:41.630> green<00:03:42.110> card<00:03:42.560> something<00:03:43.340> i<00:03:43.459> don't

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
a like a green card something i don't

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.780

know<00:03:43.670> what<00:03:43.910> color<00:03:44.090> but<00:03:44.810> like<00:03:44.959> I<00:03:45.140> uh<00:03:45.489> yeah<00:03:46.489> just

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
know what color but like I uh yeah just

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.460 
know what color but like I uh yeah just
something<00:03:47.150> something<00:03:47.690> to<00:03:47.840> refresh<00:03:48.079> the<00:03:48.320> game

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
something something to refresh the game

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.710 
something something to refresh the game
and<00:03:48.709> put<00:03:48.739> it<00:03:48.950> like<00:03:49.130> a<00:03:49.280> small<00:03:49.940> amount<00:03:50.360> of<00:03:50.510> them

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
and put it like a small amount of them

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.990 
and put it like a small amount of them
so<00:03:50.959> it<00:03:51.049> gets<00:03:51.140> people<00:03:51.350> hyped<00:03:51.680> up<00:03:51.890> and<00:03:52.160> I<00:03:52.790> think

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
so it gets people hyped up and I think

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.050 
so it gets people hyped up and I think
that'd<00:03:53.120> be<00:03:53.269> really<00:03:53.420> cool<00:03:56.920> mmm<00:03:57.920> not<00:03:58.579> happy<00:03:58.910> with

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
that'd be really cool mmm not happy with

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.449 
that'd be really cool mmm not happy with
those<00:03:59.150> bowls<00:03:59.480> but<00:03:59.690> like<00:03:59.870> oh<00:04:00.079> we<00:04:00.680> three<00:04:01.250> um

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
those bowls but like oh we three um

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.620 
those bowls but like oh we three um
another<00:04:04.459> change<00:04:04.730> team<00:04:04.910> alright<00:04:05.180> I<00:04:05.209> like<00:04:05.329> it

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
another change team alright I like it

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.599 
another change team alright I like it
but<00:04:06.380> yeah<00:04:06.530> I'm<00:04:06.920> trying<00:04:07.160> to<00:04:07.220> think<00:04:07.250> of<00:04:07.430> ways<00:04:07.549> to

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:07.609 
but yeah I'm trying to think of ways to

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:09.910 
but yeah I'm trying to think of ways to
like<00:04:07.940> refresh<00:04:08.299> the<00:04:08.450> game<00:04:08.600> now<00:04:08.810> and<00:04:09.049> a<00:04:09.320> little

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
like refresh the game now and a little

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.090 
like refresh the game now and a little
refresh<00:04:10.549> Hut<00:04:10.760> specifically<00:04:11.720> and<00:04:12.070> it'd<00:04:13.070> be

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
refresh Hut specifically and it'd be

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.740 
refresh Hut specifically and it'd be
cool<00:04:13.489> if<00:04:13.519> they<00:04:13.820> could<00:04:13.970> put<00:04:14.000> out<00:04:14.209> some<00:04:14.420> new<00:04:14.540> car

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
cool if they could put out some new car

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.569 
cool if they could put out some new car
like<00:04:15.079> I<00:04:15.320> don't<00:04:15.920> know<00:04:16.100> what<00:04:16.220> they<00:04:16.310> put<00:04:16.340> out

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
like I don't know what they put out

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.039 
like I don't know what they put out
there<00:04:16.910> like<00:04:17.060> you<00:04:17.299> can't<00:04:17.539> really<00:04:17.870> put<00:04:18.019> a

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
there like you can't really put a

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.870 
there like you can't really put a
special<00:04:18.410> card<00:04:18.590> in<00:04:18.650> the<00:04:18.709> offseason<00:04:18.890> like<00:04:19.549> who's
