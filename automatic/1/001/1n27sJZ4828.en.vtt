00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.440
 cheaper than they bought not only 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.420
 so then once to complete 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.500
 our collection acquire the two 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.260
 models as they should be noted as the box 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.379
 where these square ones come from is very 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.589
 very beautiful and is perfectly designed 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.980
 to contain inside a 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:04.500
 wonderful speed cube they send 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.980
 here the ace and the advanced system of 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.840
 bears security 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.950
 prevents opening the box easily 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.530
 completely old oscillating and 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.980
 four-year-old cousins who want 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.880
 grab our cubes and get out of your 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.890
 hiding place 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.280
 this square one of the brand calvin vean 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:30.170
 what a beautiful presentation you have and you are 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:32.960
 letters in a glossy finish not very 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.810
 father as metallic and from this part 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.180
 back in a very nice blue 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.010
 the word calvin happened good first thing 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.260
 what I have to tell you is that I'm 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.890
 amazed by the quality of materials 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:48.110
 of this square one the plastics are of 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.810
 very high quality and stickers too 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.060
 are of very good quality is also from 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:57.020
 emphasize that they took great care of the 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:59.710
 made of the the color scheme is 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:03.970
 very well selected not to confuse 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:07.400
 none of the colors within this 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.470
 this cube as such the blue has very 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.230
 good tonality to the contrary with the 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.640
 orange with red 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.620
 and obviously with green is 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.409
 completely different and all the 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.269
 colors maintain this same scheme of 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:21.340
 do not get confused about trying not 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.880
 get confused and that makes me a great 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.850
 success 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.460
 and I have adjusted and lubricated one of these 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.560
 cubes and I have used it continuously and 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:34.610
 The first thing I've noticed is that you're 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.890
 letters are erased very quickly both 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.130
 what they say here square one as the 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.050
 that says the soldering iron mark step is a bit 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.850
 frustrating because good well you know 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.190
 one that we like to be like that 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.050
 teaching our cubes as it is 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.940
 important that the brand stays here 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.900
 but it is erased very fast and with much 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:58.880
 I have chosen to stay with one 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:01.760
 white look like as has 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.950
 completely deleted the word square and 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.460
 here Calvin Well has disappeared by 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.440
 complete but I have not even a week 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.300
 to use it then it's a crazy thing 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.880
 but good 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:18.050
 It is worth noting that I have already tried all 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:20.180
 the square ones of the market and without place 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.490
 doubt this is the best square one of 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.780
 everyone see how easily they rotate their 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.270
 layers 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.660
 the lightest and the lightest of all 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:33.780
 they even went to the turn 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.270
 comes to rotate up to twice the 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.370
 full layer with a little touch of 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.600
 our fingers 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.810
 I say, I know that these finger tricks are 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.610
 mortals are not great but but the 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.740
 it's true that it turns very well 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.260
 unlike the square one mf 8 is from 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.300
 The Calvin brand has no symptoms 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.700
 of getting stuck or that some piece of 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.940
 clog the layer inside 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.650
 intermediate that competes strongly with 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.560
 the mf 8 the truth is that this minigira 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.080
 dramatically and is in 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.110
 combination with the layer below as 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.790
 you can see tour very easy I have never 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.400
 practiced score one in fact only 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.460
 I collect them for per hobby not 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.280
 because I quite like the step to how 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:20.100
 but I do not practice it, that's why 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.620
 I have this scrambled here and I have tried it 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.560
 to solve but I'm not very skilled with it 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.890
 is kurbÃ¡n then I have tried to 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.690
 learn but it's really complicated to 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:34.560
 least at least it was difficult for me 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:36.760
 quite and therefore nothing I recommend 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.980
 exceedingly the only great disadvantage 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.160
 has the square one on its competition 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:44.440
 is the price is true the quality of 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.870
 materials is very high the stickers are 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.670
 very good and the turn of each one of his 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.590
 layers is the best that exists in the 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.960
 market but the great disadvantage that 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.000
 presents is that being calvin the 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.360
 square one of this brand raises its 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.600
 prices very high so but 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.910
 I also have to be honest that every 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.220
 weight that you spend in acquiring one of these 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:09.010
 square ones it's worth it's worth no place 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.470
 doubts because as you can see tour of 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:14.440
 very good way and you will have a 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:16.420
 performance and a very long life then 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.390
 your investment will be safe 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.980
 I do not have more to say about 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.140
 truth is that I am amazed with the 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.730
 performance of this sport ones and if you 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.440
 you have one of these comments me your 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.790
 comments like leave me in the box 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.700
 comments how you have done with your 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:34.270
 hanging and if you practice what is your 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:36.130
 time your pp with the score one the truth 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.230
 is that it is magnificent I love the way 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.180
 in which these things are undone the 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.010
 way in which everything is deformed and 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.680
 as after we have to return it cube 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:46.690
 and then painting colors is without 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.220
 doubt my nemesis 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:51.040
 I have always suffered to learn evil 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:54.370
 of score one but this version in this 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:58.210
 fabulous and wonderful well of the brand 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:59.770
