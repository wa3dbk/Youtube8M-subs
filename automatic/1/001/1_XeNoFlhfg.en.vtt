bit lighter than the older for roles but

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.100 
bit lighter than the older for roles but
they<00:01:40.829> also<00:01:40.979> have<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:42.299> same<00:01:42.479> protection<00:01:42.899> so

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
they also have a the same protection so

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.300 
they also have a the same protection so
that's<00:01:43.890> good<00:01:45.680> that's<00:01:46.680> pretty<00:01:46.920> much<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.100> for
