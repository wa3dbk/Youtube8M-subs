piece<00:03:49.700> itself<00:03:50.269> I<00:03:50.590> plan<00:03:51.590> on<00:03:51.620> getting<00:03:51.980> the<00:03:52.400> metal

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
piece itself I plan on getting the metal

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.000 
piece itself I plan on getting the metal
straps<00:03:53.359> that<00:03:53.810> come<00:03:54.079> out<00:03:54.200> later<00:03:54.440> in<00:03:54.650> the<00:03:54.769> fall

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
straps that come out later in the fall

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.270 
straps that come out later in the fall
those<00:03:55.790> retail<00:03:56.269> for<00:03:56.570> about<00:03:56.840> 80<00:03:57.170> bucks<00:03:57.290> but<00:03:58.100> you

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
those retail for about 80 bucks but you

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.860 
those retail for about 80 bucks but you
can<00:03:58.430> actually<00:03:58.850> buy<00:03:59.060> this<00:03:59.120> with<00:03:59.510> the<00:03:59.630> metal

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
can actually buy this with the metal

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.860 
can actually buy this with the metal
straps<00:04:00.109> later<00:04:00.410> on<00:04:00.650> for<00:04:01.310> 300<00:04:01.820> altogether<00:04:02.299> now

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
straps later on for 300 altogether now

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.360 
straps later on for 300 altogether now
you<00:04:02.930> pay<00:04:03.170> a<00:04:03.200> premium<00:04:03.440> for<00:04:03.680> the<00:04:03.890> metal<00:04:04.100> straps

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
you pay a premium for the metal straps

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.910 
you pay a premium for the metal straps
it's<00:04:04.700> $80<00:04:05.299> but<00:04:05.930> they're<00:04:06.079> factoring<00:04:06.590> the<00:04:06.709> price

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
it's $80 but they're factoring the price

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.069 
it's $80 but they're factoring the price
of<00:04:07.220> the<00:04:07.760> leather<00:04:08.000> straps<00:04:08.390> that<00:04:08.600> are<00:04:08.660> included

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
of the leather straps that are included

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:12.490 
of the leather straps that are included
here<00:04:09.590> so<00:04:10.220> if<00:04:10.760> you<00:04:11.359> were<00:04:11.510> to<00:04:11.630> buy<00:04:11.780> both<00:04:12.109> of<00:04:12.320> them

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
here so if you were to buy both of them

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.830 
here so if you were to buy both of them
separately<00:04:12.950> it<00:04:13.519> all<00:04:13.970> would<00:04:14.299> always<00:04:14.510> come<00:04:14.810> out

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
separately it all would always come out

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.090 
separately it all would always come out
to<00:04:15.220> 330<00:04:16.220> dollars<00:04:16.430> so<00:04:17.419> yeah<00:04:17.959> that's<00:04:18.200> that<00:04:18.289> so

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
to 330 dollars so yeah that's that so

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.130 
to 330 dollars so yeah that's that so
let's<00:04:19.789> see<00:04:19.910> if<00:04:20.000> I<00:04:20.090> can<00:04:20.239> actually<00:04:20.450> take<00:04:20.930> this

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
let's see if I can actually take this

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.020 
let's see if I can actually take this
sticker<00:04:21.500> off<00:04:21.739> the<00:04:21.950> screen

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
sticker off the screen

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.420 
sticker off the screen
and<00:04:23.960> boom<00:04:24.200> there<00:04:24.500> you<00:04:24.530> have<00:04:24.770> it<00:04:25.100> now<00:04:25.190> I<00:04:25.220> didn't

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
and boom there you have it now I didn't

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.610 
and boom there you have it now I didn't
mention<00:04:25.550> it<00:04:25.790> yet<00:04:25.970> but<00:04:26.240> the<00:04:26.390> actual<00:04:26.810> 360<00:04:27.320> itself

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
mention it yet but the actual 360 itself

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.200 
mention it yet but the actual 360 itself
retails<00:04:28.040> for<00:04:28.130> two<00:04:28.460> hundred<00:04:28.760> and<00:04:28.850> fifty

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
retails for two hundred and fifty

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.120 
retails for two hundred and fifty
dollars<00:04:29.570> which<00:04:30.170> is<00:04:30.290> actually<00:04:30.650> a<00:04:30.680> really<00:04:30.920> good

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
dollars which is actually a really good

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.100 
dollars which is actually a really good
price<00:04:31.370> point<00:04:31.580> in<00:04:31.760> my<00:04:31.910> opinion<00:04:32.000> I<00:04:32.510> like<00:04:32.930> the

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
price point in my opinion I like the

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.710 
price point in my opinion I like the
price<00:04:33.380> I<00:04:33.800> expected<00:04:34.520> it<00:04:34.640> to<00:04:34.730> be<00:04:34.880> like<00:04:35.210> three

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
price I expected it to be like three

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.560 
price I expected it to be like three
hundred<00:04:35.870> but<00:04:36.320> thankfully<00:04:36.890> it<00:04:36.980> wasn't<00:04:37.220> now<00:04:38.150> I'm

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
hundred but thankfully it wasn't now I'm

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.420 
hundred but thankfully it wasn't now I'm
at<00:04:38.840> the<00:04:39.050> bottom<00:04:39.080> here<00:04:39.560> you<00:04:39.680> might<00:04:39.860> be<00:04:39.890> I'll<00:04:40.370> be

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
at the bottom here you might be I'll be

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.160 
at the bottom here you might be I'll be
able<00:04:40.550> to<00:04:40.640> see<00:04:40.820> it<00:04:40.910> already<00:04:41.180> there's<00:04:41.810> a<00:04:41.900> little

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.170 
able to see it already there's a little

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.950 
able to see it already there's a little
black<00:04:42.740> bezel<00:04:43.160> now<00:04:43.940> it<00:04:44.150> doesn't<00:04:44.480> go<00:04:44.540> all<00:04:44.780> the

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
black bezel now it doesn't go all the

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.690 
black bezel now it doesn't go all the
way<00:04:44.990> around<00:04:45.170> the<00:04:45.500> screen<00:04:45.770> because<00:04:46.130> all<00:04:46.490> the

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
way around the screen because all the

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.240 
way around the screen because all the
sensors<00:04:47.090> are<00:04:47.270> down<00:04:47.420> here<00:04:47.840> and<00:04:47.990> it<00:04:48.950> doesn't<00:04:49.160> go

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
sensors are down here and it doesn't go

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:50.440 
sensors are down here and it doesn't go
all<00:04:49.400> around<00:04:49.640> the<00:04:49.700> screen<00:04:49.940> so<00:04:50.060> that<00:04:50.180> they<00:04:50.300> don't

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
all around the screen so that they don't

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.390 
all around the screen so that they don't
take<00:04:51.110> away<00:04:51.260> from<00:04:51.650> real<00:04:51.860> estate<00:04:51.980> for<00:04:52.370> the

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
take away from real estate for the

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.210 
take away from real estate for the
screen<00:04:52.790> so<00:04:53.330> all<00:04:53.630> of<00:04:53.810> that<00:04:53.840> sensors<00:04:54.710> and<00:04:55.070> stuff

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
screen so all of that sensors and stuff

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.950 
screen so all of that sensors and stuff
like<00:04:55.460> that<00:04:55.610> are<00:04:55.820> all<00:04:55.970> dumb<00:04:56.330> packed<00:04:56.720> at<00:04:56.870> the

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
like that are all dumb packed at the

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.750 
like that are all dumb packed at the
bottom<00:04:57.350> so<00:04:57.680> now<00:04:57.830> let's<00:04:58.040> actually<00:04:58.160> see<00:04:58.520> if<00:04:58.610> we

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
bottom so now let's actually see if we

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.210 
bottom so now let's actually see if we
can<00:04:58.940> power<00:04:59.300> this<00:04:59.600> thing<00:04:59.840> on<00:05:00.050> so<00:05:00.710> just<00:05:01.100> press

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
can power this thing on so just press

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.070 
can power this thing on so just press
the<00:05:01.370> button<00:05:01.490> got<00:05:01.760> a<00:05:01.790> little<00:05:02.000> vibrate<00:05:02.450> and<00:05:02.630> you

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
the button got a little vibrate and you

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.700 
the button got a little vibrate and you
can<00:05:03.230> see<00:05:03.440> the<00:05:03.560> Motorola<00:05:03.980> symbol<00:05:04.460> here<00:05:05.680> kind<00:05:06.680> of

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
can see the Motorola symbol here kind of

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.520 
can see the Motorola symbol here kind of
reminds<00:05:07.040> me<00:05:07.070> of<00:05:07.190> the<00:05:07.310> bat-signal<00:05:08.169> and<00:05:09.169> inside

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
reminds me of the bat-signal and inside

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.340 
reminds me of the bat-signal and inside
you<00:05:09.740> can<00:05:09.890> see<00:05:10.070> the<00:05:10.100> startup<00:05:10.580> screen<00:05:11.180> I<00:05:11.600> show

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
you can see the startup screen I show

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.780 
you can see the startup screen I show
you<00:05:12.380> some<00:05:12.620> of<00:05:12.740> the<00:05:12.830> mechanics<00:05:13.280> inside<00:05:13.580> of<00:05:13.700> a

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
you some of the mechanics inside of a

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.900 
you some of the mechanics inside of a
watch<00:05:13.970> and<00:05:14.840> here<00:05:15.620> you<00:05:15.710> have<00:05:15.890> the<00:05:16.130> Android<00:05:16.610> wear

watch and here you have the Android wear

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.330 
watch and here you have the Android wear
boot<00:05:17.780> up<00:05:17.930> so<00:05:18.320> what<00:05:18.440> I'm<00:05:18.530> gonna<00:05:18.620> do<00:05:18.800> now<00:05:18.919> guys<00:05:19.190> is

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:50.390 
guys know in my review how it's worked

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.690 
guys know in my review how it's worked
out<00:05:50.540> for<00:05:50.840> me<00:05:50.870> it<00:05:51.560> also<00:05:51.740> has<00:05:52.010> 4<00:05:52.250> gigs<00:05:52.520> of

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:52.700 
out for me it also has 4 gigs of

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.730 
out for me it also has 4 gigs of
internal<00:05:52.850> storage<00:05:53.479> I<00:05:53.930> don't<00:05:54.290> think<00:05:54.440> you'll<00:05:54.590> be

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
internal storage I don't think you'll be

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.560 
internal storage I don't think you'll be
able<00:05:54.830> to<00:05:54.979> store<00:05:55.220> anything<00:05:55.520> on<00:05:55.850> this<00:05:56.120> but<00:05:56.419> I'm

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:56.570 
able to store anything on this but I'm

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.420 
able to store anything on this but I'm
sure<00:05:56.600> that's<00:05:57.050> for<00:05:57.200> like<00:05:57.350> future<00:05:57.500> updates<00:05:58.130> and

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
sure that's for like future updates and

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.310 
sure that's for like future updates and
handling<00:05:58.880> firmware<00:05:59.479> and<00:05:59.630> software<00:05:59.690> and<00:06:00.140> stuff

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.320 
handling firmware and software and stuff

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.040 
handling firmware and software and stuff
like<00:06:00.470> that<00:06:00.740> it<00:06:01.100> also<00:06:01.220> has<00:06:01.400> 512<00:06:02.300> megabytes<00:06:02.870> of

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050 
like that it also has 512 megabytes of

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.100 
like that it also has 512 megabytes of
RAM<00:06:03.760> bluetooth<00:06:04.760> 4.0<00:06:05.419> which<00:06:05.630> is<00:06:05.720> how<00:06:05.990> it

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
RAM bluetooth 4.0 which is how it

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.050 
RAM bluetooth 4.0 which is how it
connects<00:06:06.410> to<00:06:06.500> your<00:06:06.590> phone<00:06:06.740> or<00:06:07.220> Android<00:06:07.760> device

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
connects to your phone or Android device

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.330 
connects to your phone or Android device
and<00:06:08.419> it's<00:06:08.780> also<00:06:09.020> waterproof<00:06:09.770> and<00:06:10.160> dustproof

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:10.340 
and it's also waterproof and dustproof

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.340 
and it's also waterproof and dustproof
so<00:06:10.910> you<00:06:10.970> can<00:06:11.240> probably<00:06:11.419> take<00:06:11.810> a<00:06:11.870> shower<00:06:12.080> with

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:12.350 
so you can probably take a shower with

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:13.630 
so you can probably take a shower with
this<00:06:12.500> with<00:06:12.680> no<00:06:12.830> problem<00:06:12.860> you<00:06:13.370> don't<00:06:13.490> have<00:06:13.580> to

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:13.640 
this with no problem you don't have to

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.250 
this with no problem you don't have to
worry<00:06:13.820> about<00:06:13.880> that<00:06:14.270> but<00:06:14.750> that's<00:06:14.960> enough<00:06:15.200> of

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:15.260 
worry about that but that's enough of

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.870 
worry about that but that's enough of
the<00:06:15.410> specs<00:06:15.680> let<00:06:15.979> me<00:06:16.070> get<00:06:16.220> this<00:06:16.310> connected<00:06:16.580> to<00:06:16.820> a

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 
the specs let me get this connected to a

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.219 
the specs let me get this connected to a
device<00:06:17.180> and<00:06:17.210> I'll<00:06:17.540> let<00:06:17.660> you<00:06:17.780> guys<00:06:17.930> know<00:06:18.110> my

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.090 
first impressions alright guys so I

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:21.490 
first impressions alright guys so I
finished<00:06:20.300> setting<00:06:20.690> up<00:06:20.840> and<00:06:21.050> once<00:06:21.200> you<00:06:21.290> start

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500 
finished setting up and once you start

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.440 
finished setting up and once you start
the<00:06:21.650> initial<00:06:21.860> setup<00:06:22.310> process<00:06:22.640> you<00:06:23.419> actually

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:23.450 
the initial setup process you actually

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.480 
the initial setup process you actually
have<00:06:24.050> to<00:06:24.200> charge<00:06:24.530> it<00:06:24.740> some<00:06:24.979> in<00:06:25.190> order<00:06:25.340> to

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.490 
have to charge it some in order to

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.340 
have to charge it some in order to
actually<00:06:25.640> use<00:06:26.030> it<00:06:26.060> I<00:06:26.419> think<00:06:26.630> I<00:06:26.960> have<00:06:27.050> to<00:06:27.140> start

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:27.350

actually use it I think I have to start
so<00:06:27.560> at<00:06:27.830> least<00:06:28.040> about<00:06:28.280> 75%<00:06:29.270> until<00:06:29.540> you<00:06:29.630> let<00:06:29.810> me

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:29.990 
so at least about 75% until you let me

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.630 
so at least about 75% until you let me
mess<00:06:30.229> around<00:06:30.380> with<00:06:30.770> the<00:06:30.950> settings<00:06:31.370> and

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:31.640 
mess around with the settings and

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.330 
mess around with the settings and
actually<00:06:32.360> get<00:06:32.539> into<00:06:32.750> the<00:06:33.020> 360<00:06:33.680> and<00:06:33.860> for<00:06:34.250> some

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:34.340 
actually get into the 360 and for some

you guys know in a full review but so
far<00:07:09.770> my<00:07:09.830> first<00:07:10.160> impression<00:07:10.730> is<00:07:10.880> that<00:07:10.940> I<00:07:11.210> am

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:11.390 
far my first impression is that I am

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.570 
far my first impression is that I am
very<00:07:11.660> happy<00:07:11.870> with<00:07:12.050> this<00:07:12.350> it<00:07:12.890> looks<00:07:13.250> like<00:07:13.430> it's

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:13.580 
very happy with this it looks like it's

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.880 
very happy with this it looks like it's
a<00:07:13.640> quality<00:07:14.000> device<00:07:14.420> it<00:07:14.720> feels<00:07:15.020> very<00:07:15.350> premium

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:15.890 
a quality device it feels very premium

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:18.010 
a quality device it feels very premium
it<00:07:16.400> definitely<00:07:17.030> seems<00:07:17.360> like<00:07:17.450> it's<00:07:17.690> worth<00:07:17.840> the

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:18.020 
it definitely seems like it's worth the

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.570 
it definitely seems like it's worth the
two<00:07:18.170> hundred<00:07:18.470> and<00:07:18.560> fifty<00:07:18.800> dollars<00:07:19.160> that<00:07:19.190> you

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:19.580 
two hundred and fifty dollars that you

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:20.200 
two hundred and fifty dollars that you
pay<00:07:19.730> for<00:07:19.790> it

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:20.210 
pay for it

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:22.900 
pay for it
but<00:07:20.810> I<00:07:21.080> can't<00:07:21.650> make<00:07:21.740> any<00:07:21.890> final<00:07:22.250> decisions

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:22.910 
but I can't make any final decisions

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:24.910 
but I can't make any final decisions
about<00:07:23.120> the<00:07:23.690> overall<00:07:24.080> experience

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:24.920 
about the overall experience

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.830 
about the overall experience

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:26.840 
until I've used it for a bit and I

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.210 
until I've used it for a bit and I
actually<00:07:26.990> mess<00:07:27.350> around<00:07:27.500> with<00:07:27.770> the<00:07:27.890> software

some<00:07:28.550> but<00:07:28.760> the<00:07:29.180> actual<00:07:29.630> feel<00:07:29.930> itself<00:07:30.380> is<00:07:30.560> very

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:30.860 
some but the actual feel itself is very
