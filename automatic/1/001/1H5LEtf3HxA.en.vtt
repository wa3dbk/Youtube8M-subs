shotgun got a manual iron sight back

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.130 
shotgun got a manual iron sight back
here<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.659> up<00:02:07.380> here<00:02:07.849> along<00:02:08.849> with<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:09.599> parallax

why<00:02:13.769> do<00:02:13.829> I<00:02:13.950> have<00:02:14.129> two<00:02:14.310> sighting<00:02:14.700> systems<00:02:15.060> on

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
why do I have two sighting systems on

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.330 
why do I have two sighting systems on
this<00:02:15.390> well<00:02:15.959> because<00:02:16.319> as<00:02:16.469> a<00:02:16.500> professional<00:02:17.159> I'm

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
this well because as a professional I'm

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.099 
this well because as a professional I'm
accountable<00:02:17.700> for<00:02:18.060> every<00:02:18.390> single<00:02:18.689> round<00:02:18.930> that

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:19.109 
accountable for every single round that

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:22.009 
accountable for every single round that
comes<00:02:19.290> out<00:02:19.469> of<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.680> weapon<00:02:20.010> all<00:02:20.939> right<00:02:21.150> so<00:02:21.900> in

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
comes out of the weapon all right so in

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.410 
comes out of the weapon all right so in
case<00:02:22.230> this<00:02:22.439> topic<00:02:23.310> fails<00:02:23.640> me<00:02:23.849> I've<00:02:24.060> got<00:02:24.390> a

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
case this topic fails me I've got a

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.539 
case this topic fails me I've got a
backup<00:02:24.689> built<00:02:25.230> in<00:02:25.379> okay<00:02:25.890> so<00:02:25.950> I<00:02:26.129> have<00:02:26.370> that

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
backup built in okay so I have that

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.270 
backup built in okay so I have that
redundancy<00:02:27.209> is<00:02:28.049> this<00:02:28.290> necessary<00:02:28.500> for<00:02:29.069> a<00:02:29.099> home

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
redundancy is this necessary for a home

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.899 
redundancy is this necessary for a home
defense<00:02:29.609> application<00:02:30.299> not<00:02:31.290> really<00:02:31.650> is<00:02:31.980> it<00:02:32.760> bad

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
defense application not really is it bad

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:34.959 
defense application not really is it bad
to<00:02:33.060> be<00:02:33.180> over-prepared<00:02:33.439> not<00:02:34.439> in<00:02:34.560> my<00:02:34.680> experience

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:34.969 
to be over-prepared not in my experience

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:38.629 
to be over-prepared not in my experience
so<00:02:35.969> I'll<00:02:36.060> leave<00:02:36.209> that<00:02:36.269> on<00:02:36.510> you<00:02:36.769> also<00:02:37.769> as<00:02:38.280> we

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:38.639 
so I'll leave that on you also as we

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:40.280 
so I'll leave that on you also as we
look<00:02:38.670> forward<00:02:39.120> down<00:02:39.389> here<00:02:39.659> I've<00:02:39.959> got<00:02:40.200> an

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
look forward down here I've got an

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.619 
look forward down here I've got an
18-inch<00:02:41.069> barrel<00:02:41.310> instead<00:02:42.299> of<00:02:42.480> the

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
18-inch barrel instead of the

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.159 
18-inch barrel instead of the
traditional<00:02:42.829> 26<00:02:43.829> 28<00:02:44.459> inch<00:02:44.670> barrel<00:02:44.879> okay<00:02:45.540> now<00:02:46.109> I

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:46.169 
traditional 26 28 inch barrel okay now I

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:47.509 
traditional 26 28 inch barrel okay now I
know<00:02:46.290> a<00:02:46.379> lot<00:02:46.590> of<00:02:46.620> you<00:02:46.799> out<00:02:46.950> there<00:02:46.980> are<00:02:47.280> thinking

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
know a lot of you out there are thinking

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.610 
know a lot of you out there are thinking
okay<00:02:47.909> the<00:02:48.090> shorter<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.569> barrel<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.349> wider

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
okay the shorter the barrel the wider

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.649 
okay the shorter the barrel the wider
the<00:02:49.859> spread<00:02:49.889> on<00:02:50.519> that<00:02:51.120> pattern<00:02:51.480> of<00:02:51.569> that

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
the spread on that pattern of that

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:54.759 
the spread on that pattern of that
shotgun<00:02:51.989> okay<00:02:52.859> that's<00:02:53.400> not<00:02:53.639> necessarily<00:02:54.329> true

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
shotgun okay that's not necessarily true

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.210 
shotgun okay that's not necessarily true
all<00:02:55.769> right

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
all right

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.390 
all right
so<00:02:56.819> if<00:02:57.180> I<00:02:57.540> had<00:02:57.810> this<00:02:57.989> 18<00:02:58.439> inch<00:02:58.590> barrel<00:02:58.799> shotgun

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
so if I had this 18 inch barrel shotgun

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.539 
so if I had this 18 inch barrel shotgun
and<00:02:59.930> I<00:03:00.930> held<00:03:01.260> it<00:03:02.540> 10<00:03:03.540> inches<00:03:03.959> in<00:03:04.169> front<00:03:04.889> so<00:03:05.519> that

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
and I held it 10 inches in front so that

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.129 
and I held it 10 inches in front so that
the<00:03:05.790> muzzles<00:03:06.209> were<00:03:06.450> at<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.689> same<00:03:06.930> distance

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:07.139 
the muzzles were at the same distance

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:09.020 
the muzzles were at the same distance
and<00:03:07.560> I<00:03:07.590> fired<00:03:07.859> both<00:03:08.099> of<00:03:08.250> these<00:03:08.340> guns<00:03:08.639> with<00:03:08.909> the

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
and I fired both of these guns with the

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.940 
and I fired both of these guns with the
same<00:03:09.239> choke<00:03:09.569> with<00:03:10.349> the<00:03:10.469> same<00:03:10.709> ammunition<00:03:11.069> I

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
same choke with the same ammunition I

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.979 
same choke with the same ammunition I
would<00:03:13.950> get<00:03:14.129> the<00:03:14.250> same<00:03:14.430> pattern<00:03:14.700> all<00:03:15.599> right<00:03:15.780> so

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
would get the same pattern all right so

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.659 
would get the same pattern all right so
get<00:03:16.109> that<00:03:16.290> misconception<00:03:17.040> out<00:03:17.159> of<00:03:17.310> your<00:03:17.459> mind

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:17.669 
get that misconception out of your mind

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:19.550 
get that misconception out of your mind
that<00:03:17.819> the<00:03:18.060> shorter<00:03:18.510> you<00:03:18.629> go<00:03:18.840> on<00:03:19.049> that<00:03:19.229> barrel

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
that the shorter you go on that barrel

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.259 
that the shorter you go on that barrel
the<00:03:19.680> more<00:03:19.859> you<00:03:19.979> keep<00:03:20.159> chopping<00:03:20.459> it<00:03:20.729> down<00:03:20.760> the

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
the more you keep chopping it down the

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.240 
the more you keep chopping it down the
wider<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.720> pattern<00:03:22.139> is<00:03:22.349> going<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:22.859> be<00:03:25.250> moving

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
wider the pattern is going to be moving

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.949 
wider the pattern is going to be moving
back<00:03:26.310> further<00:03:26.790> after<00:03:27.419> the<00:03:27.510> barrel<00:03:27.810> length

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
back further after the barrel length

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.990 
back further after the barrel length
you'll<00:03:28.680> see<00:03:28.859> I<00:03:28.889> have<00:03:29.159> a<00:03:29.220> weapons<00:03:29.669> mounted

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
you'll see I have a weapons mounted

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.849 
you'll see I have a weapons mounted
light<00:03:30.409> do<00:03:31.409> we<00:03:31.530> think<00:03:31.709> that's<00:03:31.829> important<00:03:32.400> I<00:03:32.579> do

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:33.859 
light do we think that's important I do

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:36.949 
light do we think that's important I do
okay<00:03:34.939> because<00:03:35.939> I'm<00:03:36.150> not<00:03:36.389> going<00:03:36.629> to<00:03:36.720> take<00:03:36.900> a
