00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.030
 the leader ordered us to separate and we 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.670

 remember that I am the leader and only 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.380
 we achieve it because I live it I apologize 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.090
 but if you want to leave me abandoned in 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.010

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.260
 really do not worry I understand that in 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:42.070
 my presence in the bother to pack the

 revenge does not solve anything but if nobody 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.830
 has been mocked because of the attitude that I 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.650

 [Music] 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:09.260

 She smiles like that and I do not think she's alive
