00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:04.700 

two<00:00:02.250> years<00:00:02.520> ago<00:00:02.580> we<00:00:03.120> reported<00:00:03.300> evidence<00:00:04.110> that

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
two years ago we reported evidence that

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.270 
two years ago we reported evidence that
the<00:00:04.830> moon<00:00:04.980> is<00:00:05.220> shrinking<00:00:05.660> now<00:00:06.660> we<00:00:06.720> found

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:07.280 
the moon is shrinking now we found

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.310 
the moon is shrinking now we found
evidence<00:00:08.280> that<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:09.059> moon<00:00:09.330> is<00:00:09.599> actually<00:00:09.809> being

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
evidence that the moon is actually being

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.919 
evidence that the moon is actually being
pulled<00:00:10.800> apart<00:00:11.219> forming<00:00:11.940> features<00:00:12.660> called

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
pulled apart forming features called

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:13.669 
pulled apart forming features called
Robin

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
Robin

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.720 
Robin
so<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.809> shrinking<00:00:15.809> moon<00:00:16.080> it<00:00:16.920> turns<00:00:17.250> out<00:00:17.490> is

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
so the shrinking moon it turns out is

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.500 
so the shrinking moon it turns out is
not<00:00:17.970> shrinking<00:00:18.539> everywhere<00:00:19.850> some<00:00:20.850> places<00:00:21.119> the

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
not shrinking everywhere some places the

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.380 
not shrinking everywhere some places the
moon<00:00:21.689> is<00:00:21.900> actually<00:00:22.529> expanding<00:00:23.130> by<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:23.939> little

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
moon is actually expanding by a little

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.410 
moon is actually expanding by a little
bit<00:00:24.570> so<00:00:25.470> finding<00:00:26.010> these<00:00:26.160> young<00:00:26.490> Robin<00:00:26.849> was<00:00:27.390> a

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
bit so finding these young Robin was a

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.929 
bit so finding these young Robin was a
real<00:00:27.689> surprise<00:00:27.900> because<00:00:28.619> we<00:00:29.189> thought<00:00:29.550> well

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
real surprise because we thought well

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.240 
real surprise because we thought well
all<00:00:30.240> these<00:00:30.720> lobate<00:00:31.140> scarps<00:00:31.170> are<00:00:31.830> telling<00:00:32.130> us

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
all these lobate scarps are telling us

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.250 
all these lobate scarps are telling us
the<00:00:32.399> moon<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.669> shrinking<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:33.750> what<00:00:34.020> are<00:00:34.140> these

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
the moon is shrinking so what are these

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.119 
the moon is shrinking so what are these
little<00:00:34.910> small<00:00:35.910> grubbin<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.500> are<00:00:37.620> telling<00:00:37.890> us

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
little small grubbin that are telling us

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.760 
little small grubbin that are telling us
the<00:00:38.280> moon<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.579> pulling<00:00:38.790> apart<00:00:39.230> doing<00:00:40.230> in<00:00:40.440> in

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
the moon is pulling apart doing in in

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.290 
the moon is pulling apart doing in in

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
this picture how does this all fit

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.930 
this picture how does this all fit

planets<00:00:53.070> when<00:00:53.250> they<00:00:53.399> formed<00:00:53.879> were<00:00:54.120> very<00:00:54.390> hot

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
planets when they formed were very hot

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.010 
planets when they formed were very hot
and<00:00:54.960> they<00:00:55.140> got<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:55.739> hot<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.430> they<00:00:56.579> actually

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
and they got so hot that they actually

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.799 
and they got so hot that they actually
completely<00:00:58.020> melted<00:00:58.469> when<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.550> happens<00:01:00.059> they

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
completely melted when that happens they

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.260 
completely melted when that happens they
will<00:01:00.989> be<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.590> general<00:01:01.980> state<00:01:02.219> of

will be in a general state of

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.640 
will be in a general state of
contraction<00:01:03.270> because<00:01:03.449> they're<00:01:03.870> still<00:01:04.199> hot<00:01:04.439> on

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
contraction because they're still hot on

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
the inside and cooling down and as they

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.170 
the inside and cooling down and as they
cool<00:01:06.960> they<00:01:07.260> want<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.530> shrink<00:01:07.729> only<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.909> outer

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
cool they want to shrink only the outer

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.630 
cool they want to shrink only the outer
part<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:09.960> Moon<00:01:10.260> melted<00:01:10.740> forming<00:01:11.220> what<00:01:11.400> is

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
part of the Moon melted forming what is

part of the Moon melted forming what is
called<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.210> magma<00:01:12.630> ocean<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.320> in<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:13.950> model

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
called a magma ocean and in that model

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.820 
are acting on the moon would allow us to
form<00:01:19.799> both<00:01:20.490> these<00:01:20.939> small<00:01:21.659> lobate<00:01:22.110> scarps

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
form both these small lobate scarps

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.969 
form both these small lobate scarps
that<00:01:23.189> show<00:01:23.549> contraction<00:01:24.299> as<00:01:24.450> well<00:01:24.900> as<00:01:25.170> the

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
that show contraction as well as the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.340 
that show contraction as well as the

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
small Grob on that show the moon being

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
pulled apart one of the really really

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.530 
pulled apart one of the really really
exciting<00:01:32.130> returns<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.329> Lunar

Reconnaissance Orbiter mission is that

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.719 
Reconnaissance Orbiter mission is that
we've<00:01:35.759> seen<00:01:36.150> this<00:01:36.470> now<00:01:37.470> growing<00:01:38.040> evidence<00:01:38.310> of

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
we've seen this now growing evidence of

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.240 
we've seen this now growing evidence of
very<00:01:39.390> young<00:01:39.720> geologic<00:01:40.439> activity<00:01:40.590> on<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.220> moon

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
very young geologic activity on the moon

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.200 
very young geologic activity on the moon
many<00:01:42.180> many<00:01:42.479> people<00:01:42.899> have<00:01:43.409> felt<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:44.070> moon

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
many many people have felt that the moon

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.270 
many many people have felt that the moon
was<00:01:45.210> pretty<00:01:45.450> much<00:01:45.659> geologically<00:01:46.590> dead<00:01:46.920> and

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
was pretty much geologically dead and

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.530 
was pretty much geologically dead and
what<00:01:47.520> we're<00:01:47.670> finding<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.240> that's

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
what we're finding is that that's

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.319 
what we're finding is that that's
totally<00:01:48.840> wrong<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.130> moon<00:01:50.369> appears<00:01:51.149> to

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
totally wrong that the moon appears to

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.050 
totally wrong that the moon appears to
be<00:01:51.450> geologically<00:01:51.720> active<00:01:52.380> now

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
be geologically active now

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.119 
be geologically active now
