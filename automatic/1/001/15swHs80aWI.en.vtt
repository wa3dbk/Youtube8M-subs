00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
around in the case I looked at it and I

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.110 
around in the case I looked at it and I
didn't<00:00:57.210> see<00:00:57.360> any<00:00:57.510> other<00:00:57.780> broken<00:00:58.469> pieces<00:00:58.680> so

didn't see any other broken pieces so
whatever<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.300> was<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:01.620> shattered<00:01:02.100> pretty

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
whatever it was it it shattered pretty

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.460 
whatever it was it it shattered pretty
quick<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.760> didn't<00:01:03.030> hurt<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.359> didn't<00:01:04.229> hurt<00:01:04.350> the

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
quick it didn't hurt the didn't hurt the

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.250 
quick it didn't hurt the didn't hurt the
ring<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.799> pinion<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.600> but<00:01:06.600> maybe<00:01:06.900> this

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
ring and pinion in it but maybe this

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.859 
ring and pinion in it but maybe this
housing<00:01:07.860> here<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.729> kind<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.119> like<00:01:09.299> there

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
housing here this is kind of like there

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.600 
housing here this is kind of like there
might<00:01:10.020> be<00:01:10.080> some<00:01:10.409> extra<00:01:10.799> pieces<00:01:11.040> laying<00:01:11.430> around

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
might be some extra pieces laying around

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.550 
might be some extra pieces laying around
on<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.060> one<00:01:13.369> anyhow<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:15.229> ring<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.380> pinion

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
on this one anyhow the ring and pinion

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.370 
on this one anyhow the ring and pinion
looks<00:01:16.860> good<00:01:19.280> so<00:01:20.659> that's<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.900> part<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.200> the

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
looks good so that's the part that the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.080 
looks good so that's the part that the
axle<00:01:22.740> came<00:01:22.920> out<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:24.259> and<00:01:25.610> don't<00:01:26.610> feel<00:01:26.939> any

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
axle came out of and don't feel any

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.050 
axle came out of and don't feel any
rough<00:01:27.390> pieces<00:01:27.689> in<00:01:27.990> here<00:01:28.200> although<00:01:29.060> there's

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
rough pieces in here although there's

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.990 
rough pieces in here although there's
probably<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.540> spacer<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.229> might<00:01:31.560> go<00:01:31.740> in<00:01:32.000> right

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
probably a spacer that might go in right

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.870 
probably a spacer that might go in right
in<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.299> area<00:01:33.479> here<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:34.229> have<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.159> ask<00:01:35.280> Gina<00:01:35.640> on

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
in this area here I have to ask Gina on

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.170 
in this area here I have to ask Gina on
that<00:01:36.060> one<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.210> don't<00:01:36.329> have<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.540> book<00:01:37.729> anyhow<00:01:38.729> I

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
that one I don't have a book anyhow I

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.399 
that one I don't have a book anyhow I
was<00:01:39.540> hoping<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:41.119> this<00:01:42.119> drums<00:01:42.540> locked<00:01:42.899> up<00:01:43.170> so

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
was hoping that this drums locked up so

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.950 
was hoping that this drums locked up so
either<00:01:43.850> when<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:44.939> got<00:01:45.119> this<00:01:45.270> thing<00:01:45.479> it's<00:01:45.630> at<00:01:45.780> for

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
either when I got this thing it's at for

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.510 
either when I got this thing it's at for
about<00:01:46.110> four<00:01:46.350> years<00:01:46.380> in<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.829> backyard<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:47.460> I

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
about four years in the backyard so I

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.060 
about four years in the backyard so I
think<00:01:47.640> this<00:01:48.060> drum<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.509> locked<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.770> brake

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
think this drum is locked the brake

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.770 
think this drum is locked the brake
shoes<00:01:50.340> are<00:01:50.549> locked<00:01:50.790> on<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.119> drum<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:51.720> I'm

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
shoes are locked on the drum so I'm

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.310 
shoes are locked on the drum so I'm
gonna<00:01:51.899> have<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:53.030> make<00:01:54.030> up<00:01:54.180> tool<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.600> guess<00:01:55.110> to

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
gonna have to make up tool I guess to

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.310 
gonna have to make up tool I guess to
get<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.710> off<00:01:56.659> I'll<00:01:57.659> probably<00:01:57.689> have<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.229> get

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
get that off I'll probably have to get

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.760 
get that off I'll probably have to get
our<00:01:58.439> long<00:01:58.649> bar<00:01:59.630> hold<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:00.780> on<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.079> that<00:02:01.229> hub

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
our long bar hold that on to that hub

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.179 
our long bar hold that on to that hub
and<00:02:02.130> then<00:02:02.270> see<00:02:03.270> if<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.420> can<00:02:03.570> back<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:03.920> that<00:02:04.920> nut

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
and then see if I can back that that nut

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.900 
and then see if I can back that that nut
off<00:02:05.990> anyhow<00:02:07.009> another<00:02:08.009> day<00:02:08.280> project<00:02:08.759> for

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
off anyhow another day project for

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:15.559 
off anyhow another day project for
tomorrow<00:02:10.009> and<00:02:11.009> then<00:02:11.310> this<00:02:11.849> is<00:02:12.680> axle<00:02:14.060> this<00:02:15.060> axle

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
tomorrow and then this is axle this axle

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.160 
tomorrow and then this is axle this axle
gets<00:02:15.780> torn<00:02:16.080> up<00:02:16.290> on<00:02:16.470> me<00:02:16.700> on<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.910> Geary<00:02:18.360> end<00:02:18.629> so<00:02:19.140> I

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
gets torn up on me on the Geary end so I

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.520 
gets torn up on me on the Geary end so I
know<00:02:19.470> what<00:02:19.739> they<00:02:19.890> did<00:02:20.310> but<00:02:20.580> they<00:02:21.170> and<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.290> end

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
know what they did but they and the end

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.220 
know what they did but they and the end
of<00:02:22.680> it<00:02:22.800> smushed<00:02:23.190> here<00:02:23.640> so<00:02:24.030> but<00:02:24.360> whatever<00:02:24.900> did

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
of it smushed here so but whatever did

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.160 
of it smushed here so but whatever did
that<00:02:25.290> gave<00:02:25.800> out<00:02:26.040> in<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.959> cluster<00:02:27.959> area<00:02:30.050> we<00:02:31.050> can

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
that gave out in the cluster area we can

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.920 
that gave out in the cluster area we can
take<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.440> look<00:02:31.709> at<00:02:31.860> it<00:02:32.330> this<00:02:33.330> thing's<00:02:33.569> got<00:02:33.780> to

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
a thing that's where the bearing rides

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.800 
a thing that's where the bearing rides
on<00:03:13.410> that<00:03:14.370> shaft<00:03:14.670> looks<00:03:15.030> good<00:03:16.220> but<00:03:17.540> maybe<00:03:18.540> when

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
on that shaft looks good but maybe when

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.950 
on that shaft looks good but maybe when
they<00:03:18.900> put<00:03:19.110> the<00:03:19.200> drum<00:03:19.440> on<00:03:20.090> no<00:03:21.090> that's<00:03:21.390> yeah

maybe when we put the drum on me they
were<00:03:24.690> beating<00:03:25.200> on<00:03:25.320> it<00:03:25.500> that's<00:03:25.770> all<00:03:25.920> I<00:03:26.040> can

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100

one let me know
anyhow<00:03:31.050> probably<00:03:32.270> what<00:03:33.270> I'll<00:03:33.450> do<00:03:36.170> got<00:03:37.170> it

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
anyhow probably what I'll do got it

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.420 
anyhow probably what I'll do got it
almost<00:03:37.680> looks<00:03:37.860> like<00:03:37.950> it's<00:03:38.220> twisted<00:03:40.220> dad<00:03:41.220> is

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
almost looks like it's twisted dad is

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.390 
almost looks like it's twisted dad is
weird<00:03:42.500> but<00:03:43.500> look<00:03:43.680> at<00:03:43.800> the<00:03:43.890> angle<00:03:44.280> these

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
weird but look at the angle these

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.990 
weird but look at the angle these
threads<00:03:44.820> anyhow<00:03:45.770> I<00:03:46.770> might<00:03:47.400> straighten<00:03:47.760> these

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
threads anyhow I might straighten these

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.840 
threads anyhow I might straighten these
threads<00:03:48.300> out<00:03:48.480> or<00:03:49.250> I'm<00:03:50.250> gonna<00:03:50.430> have<00:03:50.610> to<00:03:50.670> I'm
