00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.600 
now in crysis 3 it's not just voiceover
and<00:01:43.660> it's<00:01:44.170> not<00:01:44.290> just<00:01:44.400> facial<00:01:45.400> capture

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
and it's not just facial capture

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.670 
and it's not just facial capture
separately<00:01:46.180> you're<00:01:46.330> doing<00:01:46.540> full<00:01:46.900> performance

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
separately you're doing full performance

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.070 
separately you're doing full performance
here<00:01:47.950> so<00:01:48.520> how<00:01:49.000> are<00:01:49.090> you<00:01:49.180> finding<00:01:49.420> that<00:01:49.690> it

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
here so how are you finding that it

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.570 
here so how are you finding that it
feels<00:01:50.290> like<00:01:50.470> performance<00:01:51.040> you<00:01:51.280> know<00:01:51.400> you've

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
feels like performance you know you've

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.240 
feels like performance you know you've
got<00:01:51.700> the<00:01:51.820> camera<00:01:52.180> on<00:01:52.210> so<00:01:52.540> there's<00:01:52.690> a<00:01:52.750> bit<00:01:52.870> of<00:01:52.900> a

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
got the camera on so there's a bit of a

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.300 
got the camera on so there's a bit of a
TV<00:01:54.250> aspect<00:01:54.940> to<00:01:55.450> it<00:01:55.500> that's<00:01:56.500> familiar<00:01:56.740> in<00:01:57.070> that

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
TV aspect to it that's familiar in that

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.640 
TV aspect to it that's familiar in that
in<00:01:57.550> that<00:01:57.610> way<00:01:58.020> but<00:01:59.020> the<00:01:59.170> idea<00:01:59.410> that<00:01:59.440> we're

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
in that way but the idea that we're

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.830 
in that way but the idea that we're
actually<00:01:59.770> performing<00:02:00.490> this<00:02:00.670> gives<00:02:01.510> it<00:02:01.720> a

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
actually performing this gives it a

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.870 
actually performing this gives it a
certain<00:02:02.050> way<00:02:02.200> to<00:02:02.380> certain<00:02:02.860> emotional<00:02:03.370> gravity

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
certain way to certain emotional gravity

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.700 
certain way to certain emotional gravity
that<00:02:04.120> it<00:02:04.480> wouldn't<00:02:04.780> have<00:02:04.930> if<00:02:05.110> we<00:02:05.140> were<00:02:05.290> just<00:02:05.350> in

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
that it wouldn't have if we were just in

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.609 
that it wouldn't have if we were just in
the<00:02:05.800> studio<00:02:05.860> so<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:08.020> know<00:02:08.110> it's<00:02:08.470> actually

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
the studio so you know it's actually

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.980 
the studio so you know it's actually
helping<00:02:09.070> me<00:02:09.250> I'm<00:02:09.820> actually<00:02:10.030> using<00:02:10.480> different

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
helping me I'm actually using different

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.540 
helping me I'm actually using different
muscles<00:02:11.110> from<00:02:11.470> other<00:02:11.680> disciplines<00:02:11.950> that<00:02:12.340> I've

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
muscles from other disciplines that I've

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.910 
muscles from other disciplines that I've
worked<00:02:12.760> in<00:02:12.850> the<00:02:13.090> past<00:02:13.300> and<00:02:14.260> that<00:02:14.410> helps<00:02:14.860> me

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
worked in the past and that helps me

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.010 
worked in the past and that helps me
form<00:02:15.730> this<00:02:15.880> character<00:02:16.300> in<00:02:16.420> that<00:02:16.450> performance
