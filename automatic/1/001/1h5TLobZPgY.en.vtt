00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:13.410
 hello niewerth is driven since we have 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:15.600
 something of philips here around and 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.340
 the trip is also on the market 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:23.550
 Available at major dealers that 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:25.369
 such a micro music system dcm 32 60 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.659
 scolds the whole story 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:31.050
 then I put the possibilities though 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:35.720
 the design say very compact is sown 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:39.060
 The thing is pretty flat built one 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.610
 fm-radio what a dangy antenna you can get 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.930
 media of a mine aux entrance on the 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.710
 give back again 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:52.460
 you have a usb slot up here 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:55.470
 the cd drive can also be mp3 and 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:59.600
 rewritable formats can 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:01.950
 read and we have such a dual yet 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.229
 pretty cool once here with the 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.990
 lightning connection and i can do that 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.940
 Whole fun turn and 1030 am 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.350
 connection that is if that is now 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:15.870
 court for the whole family is and 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.300
 man or woman have an iphone 5 s and 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:23.250
 the kids or the life companion who has 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:26.250
 the old iphone 4s for example that it 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.690
 no problem that both here their devices 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.920
 load and play music 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.659
 what is missing is a wireless 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.210
 interface so bluetooth or 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:41.940
 Airplay does not have the dcm 32 60 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.620
 You can however raise the usb-stick 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.640
 connect and there also music 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.549
 reproduce 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.680
 it's easy to shut down the one 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.430
 whole fun easy 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.430
 then moment may 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.090
 fact immediately back to me 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.020
 of course now my iphone my usb 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.510
 stick man cd 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.370
 in it and I have the same from the sofa 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.410
 I would like to control such a small one 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.990
 Remote control pretty much all 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:15.180
 I can offer important functions 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:17.750
 play break volume I can change in 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.580
 shuffle mode and go to more 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.380
 Sales Participations There are various 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.390
 corner quieter that I can select it 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.280
 you can see the whole thing on the right in the 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.080
 small display I now down 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.660
 light reflections you can not do that 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.980
 recognize 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.730
 that's how waterbirth works 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.850
 good range 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.830
 You can from all corners of the room 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:40.830
 access it and you could now 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.770
 I also have to change the audio source 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:47.870
 rather important and proclaimed 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:53.520
 say okay i want to listen to the radio and 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:55.590
 that is no problem either 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.959
 different radio are the store 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.830
 et cetera pp noon of course that works 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.940
 not there 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:06.420
 and there just was not enough display 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:09.380
 only this Led bar it fits but already 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:13.470
 for the purposes I think so 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.239
 iphone here always present the stick 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.340
 I just go in 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:19.410
 you will see that loaded and I can 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.019
 now on radio citizen in half 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.209
 hour and would like to be the last 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.870
 song from my iphone hear no further 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:32.420
 problem I can with the 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.420
 switch remote to the dock 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:39.030
 It would take a few seconds to do that 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:45.769
 and then I can play the music 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:48.030
 pieces of play nuggets now the first 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:50.310
 and then actually should the 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.000
 start music 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.000
 indeed 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:00.900
 and also here I can go through as normal 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.900
 the change all 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:14.620
 There is even a menu button on the menu 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:16.680
 remote control but here at the 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.570
 iphone os function remains, I guess 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.729
 that with older ipods this is the reason 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.310
 you can also control buttons for 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:27.190
 has invented upstairs in the iphone goes 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:30.460
 in this case, however, not the 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:34.419
 sick to say is slim for the 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:37.720
 very well done for now 32 60 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:40.770
 he's got a good deal of fun, of course 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:44.020
 now no bass miracles just up and 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.760
 that there is no sound box big 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.940
 can be installed due to the compact 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.800
 Construction is so cool story with 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.110
 the dual but that I find everything 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.320
 really great and a thing maybe 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:05:00.820
 can show once is on the 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:06.729
 back gets actually says here 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:08.500
 could take things off and the whole thing 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:13.830
 can i used this too 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:16.900
 mount and of course tighten 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.860
 the whole system then for wall mounting 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.740
 use 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:25.930
 yes I think that's pretty cool city 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:29.800
 also has a hook here now it can 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:32.380
 speak up speak simply take what 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.120
 naturally in the living room on national 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.409
 important thing is if you give them that 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.320
 power cable then through the 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:39.090
 cable channels channel light is that for one 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.680
 history 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.539
 Well if you need what the cds 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.610
 what happens to different iphone 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:47.470
 generations work and where from 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.460
 you can hear radio in between 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:54.690
 the 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:54.690
 philips gcm 32 60 times for you
