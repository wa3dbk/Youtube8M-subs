00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.019
 outdoors muay thai is my new 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:31.410
 the system is designed and developed exactly 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.040
 for self defense outside and so enjoyable 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.040
 view 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.399
 so you did defensive actions 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:46.070
 I put a blog or a fill slope Well 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:48.620
 further on this does not stop you 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.739
 for you it only begins after that 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.780
 be sure to make your 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.710
 knocking u counterattacks I would 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.469
 He recommended practice and 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.760
 memorize some particular 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:02.239
 counterattack that is a specific series 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.850
 beats 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.369
 after what after one protective 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:11.780
 actions friends to you now 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:14.960
 show every counterattack to 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.600
 specific counterattack what is the maximum 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.710
 will be comfortable and best under each 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.500
 protective action 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.750
 from under the block under the slope under the dive and I 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.209
 I highly recommend you to work it out 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.220
 one counterattack and of course you can for 

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:29.899
 adjust yourself a little bit 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.899
 needs about what you have more 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:34.909
 it turns out better but to work it out 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.700
 one that is, if you put a block in 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.490
 the battle you immediately automatically throw away 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.000
 it is this series of blows that will be put off 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.649
 take you up to muscle level 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.390
 memory will work out you will not 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.640
 get lost won't you think it 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.979
 everything will be like a robot will block 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.000
 put right on the women three hits clearly 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.400
 took off 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.080
 he did immediately discord and did u 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.540
 all this will be worked out for you 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:04.150
 automatism is what you need in 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.150
 real time so look 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:12.160
 so now we will demonstrate 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.290
 counterattack after direct punch 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.840
 we will gradually go from each blow 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.500
 do counterattacks we are small stands 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.700
 the opponent hits the straight we make a bias during 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.300
 the inner part 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:28.240
 from here immediately with the left hand lower cause 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.810
 elbow bottom chin further 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.680
 add the right side to the jaw and 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.680
 doing a nick 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.950
 already opponent shattered before padded 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:42.489
 tilt and knee head add 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.250
 this will be enough for 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:49.750
 so that the enemy is already lost let's say 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:52.120
 completely if you are biased 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.390
 the outer side up from the right straight 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.450
 make a bias arm from here we do 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:01.239
 all the same, only we change the elbow yes 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.300
 we don't beat the elbow bottom volume left 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:07.870
 fist on liver plus he and from here went 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:11.680
 once the liver he immediately sails pasha and on 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:14.860
 again right side goal and from here with 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.170
 knee wolf lining there are three such 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.989
 strike but if you make them clearly 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.420
 quickly it worked all fine 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:25.000
 get so short distance 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.850
 usually when straight hit fail 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.299
 the enemy is doing everything fast under 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:35.430
 left hand walk well fountain once 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:35.430
 monsters all short 3 clear hits 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.370
