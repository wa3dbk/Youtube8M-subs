00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.420
 Talks people on the beauty channel 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.929
 we're here with another channel video 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.940
 of good structural skull 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.910
 This time I'll debut how to get a 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.880
 Lenny Wee in your game and 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.720
 increase in 25 hotels 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:26.970
 the man then I do not know that the government 15 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:28.949
 pts 6 but I think it will improve one 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:51.090
 bit right 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:01:12.900
 you will suddenly at the start of your 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:01:36.450
 I play a case and clicked continue button 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:42.720
 You will have done this by clicking with 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:47.130
 the right button but because I am a leader 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:51.079
 quickly or it there you can 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.979
 ask what this program does 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:55.890
 because she 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:02:00.810
 from what I know I think he says 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:05.210
 fragments and the type game folder does not 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:08.369
 I know where performance is best. 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.900
 if this problem persists 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:14.879
 I also recommend that you are there the 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:19.709
 the programs that come with it sometimes 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:27.209
 comes to us is necessary for the wheel and the jo 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:40.010
 We will also continue on 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:40.010
 In case I heard the guto I have pb with r 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:48.660
 when you can be changing all 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:55.440
 Settings a little bit, right? 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:03:10.769
 For you resolution recommending the 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:20.760
 with a game or to which you turn many 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:30.889
 16 bit heavy games improve draw 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:30.889
 all sounds to speculate 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:42.060
 all the settings you can 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:46.049
 You can set your vote soon I do not know 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:51.690
 who does not like the traffic and 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:54.870
 have a clue what you bought the 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:58.940
 lot of video card in case my see if 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:02.190
 no more caufield back do not know how 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:06.510
 but also some settings with 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:09.690
 seventeen wheels type what what more 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.010
 see what else weighs 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:18.530
 Can you notice smoking? 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:21.530
 and ah ah ah ah in the shade 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:25.070
 those two are who weighs the most 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:31.419
 so I recommend you turn these two on 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:34.970
 It's up to you to persist. 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:38.270

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:45.800
 video will get very heavy and will have 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:48.560
 It's enough for me to send the video 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.720

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:58.970
