00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 hey people today i want to show you how 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.919
 My favorite breakfast 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.800
 prepared and that is not only correct 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.559
 delicious but also really healthy and then 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.990
 Let's start with the smoothie 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:21.109
 used almond milk a banana 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.640
 blueberries and a bit dark 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:27.180
 chocolate and then there is everything in 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.960
 a bowl and then you do that in 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.960
 give a mixer 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.280
 and of course the milk is not allowed 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.280
 forget because 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.000
 then she just lays it down for about 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.000
 two minutes 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:50.469
 and that's it, already 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:54.180
 then just put in a gas and 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:54.180
 finished is a delicious 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:06.200
 and then we come now just yogurt 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:12.619
 fruits must be your partner to apples 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.619
 Grapes yogurt and muesli 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:19.960
 then you first cut the apple in 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.960
 little pieces 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:46.120
 and then put it in a bowl or 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:49.060
 in the little button 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.040
 and now I'm cutting the voters 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.230
 in small pieces you can of course 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.620
 actually every fruit takes what you 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:58.920
 but wish I was totally like apples and 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.920
 pears 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.570
 and you just go to the dealers 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.770
 and if you want you can do one more 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.569
 a little bit on it you have to do that 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.439
 but not 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.439
 the christmas songs 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:32.160
 and then just everything 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.160
 mix and pamper 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.319
 then of course that must be added 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.890
 and there will be always in microwave 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.190
 for about two minutes 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.989
 but that you do not make but 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:54.470
 i just do not like fruits and mine 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:57.819
 It would have been necessary and now it's just missing 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.819
 still the yogurt 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.780
 I have one 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:06.200
 Yoghurt was chosen for me because of me 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:09.110
 I'm just totally small 1 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.740
 but you can also natural yoghurt and forth 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:16.690
 is also true chocolate pudding and now 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.690
 I want it all again 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.459
 and just give another day his dream 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.459
 searched 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.000
 And that was about it 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.439
