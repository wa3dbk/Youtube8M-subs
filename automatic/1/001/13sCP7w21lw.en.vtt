00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:09.819
 and today we are going to talk about the terrestrial 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.019
 here 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.050
 hello everyone and welcome once more 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.760
 to the channel a few weeks ago almost 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.830
 already a good year I do not know exactly how much 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.720
 time there was not a review for here in 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.610
 the channel and I've decided that it's time 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.350
 Today I come to talk about the saga looks 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.120
 written by Jennifer Ostrich and 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.680
 published by neo editorial here in 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.150
 Spain as you know this saga is 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.870
 composed of five books that are 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:47.239
 syrian onix 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:48.620
 opal origin and opposition- I'm 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.750
 sure that you all know this 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.280
 successful saga of books to try 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.839
 avoid them later I'll tell you very 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.339
 what the saga is about 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:56.839
 got in the first part starts 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:58.610
 with ducati moves to a new 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:00.350
 city ​​together with his mother there will know 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.379
 a is in a that is your neighbor that is a 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.670
 pretty arrogant arrogant person 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.560
 selfish egocentric everything what you 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.149
 can you imagine is going to be a border with 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.310
 our dear Katy and that's where 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:11.750
 the spark will start if only it will remain 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.369
 here the story would have the typical 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.170
 teen romance between two young 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.000
 but nothing is further from the truth because 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.860
 what you almost do not know is that it keeps you 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.300
 a great secret maybe an accident in the 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.160
 who are already seriously injured and 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.070
 edge of death daimon lava or cure 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.479
 because daimon is an extraterrestrial yes 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.520
 ladies and gentlemen is an extraterrestrial 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.960
 sne from another planet and as for in a 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.520
 he confesses his true identity is going to 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.500
 start an incredible network of 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.659
 mysteries of supernatural elements of 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.880
 mysterious powers also a great 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.800
 amount of action a little bit of drama and 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.569
 especially much much I love you I can not 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.130
 unveil much more of the plot I've 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:44.810
 counted well above what it is about 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.150
 obsidian because the rest of the books 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.070
 if I tell you, they are spoilers 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.810
 is my review my opinion on the saga 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.250
 looks the first thing we're going to analyze is 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.720
 the narrative the five books that 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.980
 make up the saga are narrated 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.750
 from the point of view of the two 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.670
 main characters that as we have already 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.290
 said are katy and time on this is something 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.670
 that I usually like a lot 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.080
 in terms of narrative style because we 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.880
 allows you to see the story from the points 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.260
 of different views and not only see 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.060
 how are these characters 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.649
 experiencing things but like them 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.940
 they are feeling everything but I think the 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.320
 history would have been just as good if 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.850
 had been narrated only from the 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.140
 Katy's point of view I think the point 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.610
 of having also discovered time on 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.200
 as a narrator has allowed us 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.400
 we love much more of him and I think he has 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.290
 been one of the great successes of this 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.490
 saga about the dialogues I will say 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.380
 which is a novel that is directed 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.550
 mainly to the young public so 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.690
 so much all the dialogues and 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.580
 conversations that keep 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.900
 characters are very careful have 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.760
 many phrases and vocabulary that 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.590
 we use today young people and 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.270
 It also has its spicy part 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.500
 to the elements that make up this novel 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.120
 As I told you, it has a great 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.560
 component of action is something that 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.510
 called a lot of attention in this saga 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.950
 and that positively valued is that I 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.930
 I was waiting for the typical story of 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.700
 romance between two teenagers although he 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.340
 outside extraterrestrial they did not imagine anything 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.600
 beyond that romance but believe me 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.629
 the story has a great great 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.739
 action component 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:56.209
 not to at any time 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.920
 develop the action which makes 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.480
 be much more pleasant and much more agile the 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.709
 narration because we get to the part of 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.209
 the one that I'm going to analyze the romance between 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.290
 all the protagonists that knows how to be a 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.489
 little fussy about the 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.170
 romance that there is what is the novel 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.790
 youthful and I want to tell you that in this 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.500
 case I'm totally in love because 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.659
 I liked it a lot as the jce 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.310
 obsidian and onyx half second part 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:14.810
 you will see that this romance of truth that is 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.069
 necessary in the plot and that is also 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.209
 that is justified I challenge you all 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.159
 you who have not felt 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.650
 attraction for time on truth dejes de 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:23.150
 watch this video because damon is the soul 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.920
 of this saga regarding the elements 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.120
 supernatural I liked the 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.799
 endowment of powers that they have made to 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.269
 different characters in this saga 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.859
 they usually have some powers in 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.629
 common and then everyone has x with their 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:33.980
 own skills I connect it to be 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.329
 very interesting the plot and that never 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.250
 know that you will find yourself in the 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:38.989
 next story the next page or 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.760
 in the next character and regarding 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.470
 drama you already know that I'm not very close to 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.239
 read dramas but I will not let you in 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.519
 Sometimes the plot demands a little bit of 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.989
 drama to give more intensity and more 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.760
 fluency to the nobel I think the points 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.040
 of drama or betrayal that appears in these 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.629
 novels are totally necessary not 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.919
 only for the development of the plot 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:56.329
 but also by the very evolution of 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:57.410
 the characters so this time 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:59.780
 I will accept the drama 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.010
 goal do not do it I will say is that the 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.510
 dot star what called me 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.080
 definitely the attention to read 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.430
 These books 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.140
 obviously it was the subject of 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.100
 extraterrestrials I'm going to with those that I 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.540
 quite attracts the subject of the 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.220
 aliens since I started watching 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.420
 x file with my sister has 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.100
 liked because that combination between 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.680
 aliens and romance story 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.150
 contemporary that something perfect I'm going to 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.530
 tell you about three characters I'm going to 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.850
 tell them that I was surprised from the 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.830
 first moment them to typical 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.120
 introverted teenager that not only 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.980
 It lengthened many people but at the same time 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.810
 is strong and independent is like a 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.400
 lovely mix but from the moment what 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.710
 took to meet damon is like his life 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.880
 will give a 360 degree turn because 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.490
 everything that surrounds the world of 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.230
 aliens is going to be action and that's 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.370
 is going to make a lot of maturity to be more 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.660
 The truth is that it has 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.370
 surprised a lot the evolution of this 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.750
 character from the beginning to the 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.490
 order to be able to do the things that I liked 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.960
 a lot of this character is that it is 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.130
 an artistic blogger when I started 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.960
 read or exile I felt quite 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.150
 identified because it 's a girl who reads 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.890
 books and write reviews in a blog and 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.090
 it's like I am, but then the rest of 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.620
 the story will not happen to me anymore 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.560
 same as you but at least it felt 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.510
 that point of union with cat 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.919
 I think it's the point that was most 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.450
 waiting to do to be teaching what 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.889
 that really really really, yes 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.720
 you have not read the saga if you have not 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:06.220
 known to damon I do not know what you are 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.410
 hoping I have is the typical young 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.360
 egocentric and narcissistic very fat 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.350
 arrogant pimp that he will do in the 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.210
 life impossible to our protagonist 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.710
 to date very badly to the protagonist and 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.180
 this is curiously going to be that she 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.220
 hook but he is in love with her 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.630
 and she of him but to me is that it does not fit 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.490
 something like that, not with evil during 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.650
 the two first novels to attend 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.150
 that tug of war so intense that we 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.770
 attracts many of the novel theories 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.030
 romantic that's going to do in the first place 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.680
 that you fall in love much more with 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.540
 mont characters especially because you go 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.639
 to see the transformation that has that is 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.200
 incredible from the first novel to 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:36.610
 that finalized position because believe me 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.800
 that when you read it in the last novel 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.389
 is going to look like it would not go to the character 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.950
 and the second the reason is because you are going to 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:43.570
 see because almost really is in love 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.950
 of this character carry certain parts 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.380
 in the first two novels in which 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.729
 I know you really insult or hit daemon 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.460
 by but how are you doing this yes that 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:52.870
 you like it and you like it because because I 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.760
 I know why and the last thing I'm going to 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.020
 comment is the rest of the characters 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.520
 of this saga something that I liked 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.650
 enough of the way of writing of 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.569
 Jennifer in ours is that she gives life to 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.099
 development and outcome to all 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:04.300
 that appear in the novels because that 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:05.740
 I wanted to say that the author cares 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.599
 quite for all that is the novel and
