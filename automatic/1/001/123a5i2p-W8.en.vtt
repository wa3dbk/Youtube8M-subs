years old I have this thing in my head
where<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:22.140> remember<00:00:22.740> dribbling<00:00:23.429> the<00:00:23.580> whole

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:23.759 
where I remember dribbling the whole

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:26.150 
where I remember dribbling the whole
length<00:00:24.029> of<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.269> field<00:00:24.689> with<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.679> Beehive

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
that when I coach as well um it's a

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.530 
that when I coach as well um it's a
little<00:01:32.580> bit<00:01:32.700> like<00:01:32.880> getting<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.180> good<00:01:33.330> teacher

because I had to do it and I was okay at
it<00:01:50.820> but<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.120> never<00:01:51.360> was<00:01:51.570> passionate<00:01:52.050> about<00:01:52.140> it

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
it but I never was passionate about it

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.650 
it but I never was passionate about it

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
professional player you know I was very

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.610

intrigued<00:01:57.270> by<00:01:57.480> the<00:01:57.540> tactics<00:01:58.050> I<00:01:58.200> could<00:01:58.380> sit<00:01:58.590> and

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
intrigued by the tactics I could sit and

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.530 
intrigued by the tactics I could sit and
listen<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.100> my<00:01:59.190> coach<00:01:59.400> talked<00:01:59.820> about<00:02:00.090> tactics

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
for hours on end I couldn't sit in a

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.430 
for hours on end I couldn't sit in a
classroom<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.150> listen<00:02:03.480> to<00:02:03.690> the<00:02:03.900> teacher<00:02:04.110> talk

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
about math for two minutes we've spoken

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.339 
about math for two minutes we've spoken
before<00:02:07.680> about<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:09.000> fact<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.780> had<00:02:10.049> such

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
before about the fact that you had such

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.410 
before about the fact that you had such
a<00:02:10.379> short<00:02:10.849> professional<00:02:11.849> career<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.390> that

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
a short professional career and that

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.740 
a short professional career and that
that<00:02:12.930> kind<00:02:13.140> of<00:02:13.290> draw

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
that kind of draw

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.620 
that kind of draw
your<00:02:14.620> relationship<00:02:15.370> with<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:16.030> players<00:02:16.240> yeah

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
your relationship with the players yeah

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:17.910 
your relationship with the players yeah
I<00:02:16.660> think<00:02:16.780> it's<00:02:16.990> a<00:02:17.080> little<00:02:17.200> bit<00:02:17.350> unique<00:02:17.710> because

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
I think it's a little bit unique because

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.130 
I think it's a little bit unique because
I<00:02:18.100> never<00:02:18.400> really<00:02:18.610> had<00:02:18.790> a<00:02:18.820> long<00:02:19.090> playing<00:02:19.720> career

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
I never really had a long playing career

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.810 
I never really had a long playing career
I<00:02:20.290> think<00:02:20.620> that's<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:20.950> reason<00:02:21.220> I'm<00:02:21.490> where<00:02:21.700> I'm

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
I think that's the reason I'm where I'm

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.170 
I think that's the reason I'm where I'm
at<00:02:22.000> is<00:02:22.210> because<00:02:22.540> I<00:02:22.920> was<00:02:23.920> done<00:02:24.130> at<00:02:24.280> 25<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:24.760> if<00:02:25.090> I

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
at is because I was done at 25 and if I

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.490 
at is because I was done at 25 and if I
would<00:02:25.330> have<00:02:25.390> played<00:02:25.690> you<00:02:26.140> know<00:02:26.260> 10<00:02:26.470> years

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
would have played you know 10 years

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.800 
would have played you know 10 years
longer<00:02:27.040> than<00:02:27.070> that's<00:02:27.400> 10<00:02:28.060> less<00:02:28.270> years<00:02:28.540> that<00:02:28.780> I

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
longer than that's 10 less years that I

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.680 
longer than that's 10 less years that I
had<00:02:29.770> had<00:02:30.250> time<00:02:30.490> to<00:02:30.700> study<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.090> game<00:02:31.270> and<00:02:31.600> to

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
had had time to study the game and to

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.080 
had had time to study the game and to
learn<00:02:31.930> my<00:02:32.140> craft<00:02:32.170> and<00:02:32.800> to<00:02:33.070> figure<00:02:33.820> out<00:02:33.940> how<00:02:34.030> to

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
learn my craft and to figure out how to

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.940 
learn my craft and to figure out how to
put<00:02:34.330> the<00:02:34.420> pieces<00:02:34.570> together<00:02:34.870> and<00:02:35.170> to<00:02:35.800> run

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
put the pieces together and to run

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.620 
put the pieces together and to run
training<00:02:36.250> sessions<00:02:36.790> and<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.450> learn

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
training sessions and to learn

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.060 
training sessions and to learn
leadership<00:02:37.900> and<00:02:38.320> all<00:02:38.410> those<00:02:38.530> things<00:02:38.740> that<00:02:38.980> I

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
leadership and all those things that I

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.760 
leadership and all those things that I
think<00:02:39.130> are<00:02:39.870> imperative<00:02:40.870> if<00:02:41.170> you're<00:02:41.350> your

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
think are imperative if you're your

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.710 
think are imperative if you're your
coach<00:02:42.070> you<00:02:42.790> know<00:02:42.910> and<00:02:43.030> I<00:02:43.090> believe<00:02:43.150> this<00:02:43.480> it<00:02:43.630> was

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
coach you know and I believe this it was

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.180 
coach you know and I believe this it was
probably<00:02:43.990> my<00:02:44.140> calling<00:02:44.560> more<00:02:44.709> to<00:02:44.800> be<00:02:44.920> a<00:02:44.950> coach

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
probably my calling more to be a coach

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.440 
probably my calling more to be a coach
and<00:02:45.370> a<00:02:45.430> player<00:02:45.550> because<00:02:45.850> I<00:02:45.940> was<00:02:46.060> never<00:02:46.239> that

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
and a player because I was never that

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.690 
and a player because I was never that
good<00:02:46.690> at<00:02:46.750> player<00:02:47.050> you<00:02:47.739> know<00:02:47.860> I<00:02:47.890> made<00:02:48.430> it<00:02:48.550> pretty

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
good at player you know I made it pretty

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.030 
good at player you know I made it pretty
far<00:02:48.820> because<00:02:49.180> I<00:02:49.360> was<00:02:49.540> hardworking<00:02:50.530> and

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
far because I was hardworking and

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.550 
far because I was hardworking and
determined<00:02:51.730> and<00:02:51.970> you<00:02:52.720> know<00:02:52.840> smart<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:53.470> I

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
determined and you know smart and I

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.530 
determined and you know smart and I
could<00:02:53.890> play<00:02:54.010> a<00:02:54.070> role<00:02:54.190> and<00:02:54.790> I<00:02:54.820> was<00:02:54.940> a<00:02:54.970> leader<00:02:55.270> so

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
could play a role and I was a leader so

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.510 
could play a role and I was a leader so
I<00:02:55.570> made<00:02:55.780> players<00:02:56.020> around<00:02:56.260> me<00:02:56.380> better<00:02:56.590> but<00:02:57.489> I

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
I made players around me better but I

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.540 
I made players around me better but I
was<00:02:57.700> never<00:02:57.850> going<00:02:58.090> to<00:02:58.150> be<00:02:58.209> a<00:02:58.360> big-time<00:02:58.930> player

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
was never going to be a big-time player

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.190 
was never going to be a big-time player
so<00:03:00.550> I<00:03:00.580> think<00:03:00.730> it<00:03:01.000> worked<00:03:01.209> out<00:03:01.360> for<00:03:01.600> the<00:03:01.720> best<00:03:01.900> it

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
so I think it worked out for the best it

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.800 
so I think it worked out for the best it
was<00:03:02.290> tough<00:03:02.560> at<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:02.800> time<00:03:03.040> at<00:03:03.340> 25<00:03:03.850> when<00:03:04.690> I'm

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
was tough at the time at 25 when I'm

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.229 
was tough at the time at 25 when I'm
done<00:03:05.050> you<00:03:05.680> know<00:03:05.800> I<00:03:05.830> lost<00:03:06.550> them<00:03:06.790> a<00:03:06.910> bit<00:03:07.060> of<00:03:07.150> my

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
done you know I lost them a bit of my

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.400 
done you know I lost them a bit of my

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
to support them that means sometimes

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.930 
to support them that means sometimes
kicking<00:03:23.830> in<00:03:23.920> the<00:03:24.010> ass<00:03:24.190> that<00:03:24.489> means<00:03:24.700> sometimes

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
kicking in the ass that means sometimes

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.190 
kicking in the ass that means sometimes
telling<00:03:25.420> them<00:03:25.540> things<00:03:25.690> i<00:03:25.870> don't<00:03:25.930> want<00:03:26.110> to<00:03:26.170> hear

telling them things i don't want to hear

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.259 
telling them things i don't want to hear
but<00:03:27.160> i<00:03:27.220> think<00:03:27.489> if<00:03:27.580> they<00:03:27.700> understand<00:03:28.150> i'm

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
but i think if they understand i'm

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.030 
but i think if they understand i'm
trying<00:03:28.480> to<00:03:28.540> help<00:03:28.780> them<00:03:28.989> then<00:03:29.650> they'll<00:03:29.830> listen

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
to that and and i think that's the big

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.530 
to that and and i think that's the big
reason<00:03:32.410> why<00:03:32.739> i<00:03:32.860> connect<00:03:33.310> so<00:03:34.150> well<00:03:34.180> with<00:03:34.450> the

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
reason why i connect so well with the

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.840 
reason why i connect so well with the

predecessor did a good job of creating a
good<00:04:47.280> foundation<00:04:47.520> but<00:04:48.390> i<00:04:48.450> felt<00:04:48.780> there<00:04:48.960> was<00:04:49.080> a

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
good foundation but i felt there was a

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.870 
good foundation but i felt there was a
big<00:04:49.350> upside<00:04:49.710> and<00:04:50.010> I<00:04:50.130> felt<00:04:50.370> that<00:04:50.430> I<00:04:50.520> could<00:04:50.730> take

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
big upside and I felt that I could take

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.630 
big upside and I felt that I could take
it<00:04:51.030> even<00:04:51.120> further<00:04:51.650> and<00:04:52.650> I<00:04:52.830> started<00:04:53.160> it<00:04:53.310> get<00:04:53.550> the

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
it even further and I started it get the

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.210 
it even further and I started it get the
itch<00:04:53.760> to<00:04:54.120> leave<00:04:54.510> my<00:04:54.690> own<00:04:54.810> program<00:04:55.020> and<00:04:55.620> the

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
itch to leave my own program and the

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.090 
itch to leave my own program and the
opportunity<00:04:56.790> came<00:04:57.000> available<00:04:57.300> and<00:04:57.920> it<00:04:58.920> just
