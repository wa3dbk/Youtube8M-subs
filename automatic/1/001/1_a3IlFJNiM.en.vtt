 you lay very delicious street 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:30.260
 for the tracks you need the following 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:33.300
 ingredients and 250 grams of sugar 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.760

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.700
 in the packet or homemade 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.370
 networking 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.590
 550 grams of flour are now only 250 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.840
 in it 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:49.170
 275 grams butter 150 grams 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.980

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.750
 to three tablespoons of apricot jam 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.580
 before now have to make your dough 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.780
 oven still at 200 degrees above bottom heat 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.850
 preheat 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.950
 i will be in thermik today 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.590
 but you can of course also 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.259
 would always have to make other mixer 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.110
 use doorknobs 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:24.750
 I now do 175 grams of butter 250 grams 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.439
 flour yogurt and 20 grams of sugar 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.100
 and mx 3 minutes on the stage 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.100
 knead together 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.650
 when finished the dough day something else 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.210
 sticky it could still be quiet 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.210
 Knead a little flour 1 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:49.210
 if your day sticks nothing more then could 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.950
 put it on a baking sheet 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.810
 I have my square here now 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.640
 programs on a baking tray 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.920
 Of course I can also have a deep baking tray 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.190
 use but I think with the bug 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.830
 frame beautiful corner could now have 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.060
 you just spread a dough in it 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.470
 can do with his hands because again 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.180
 or roll out 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.180
 I like to do it with my hands 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.680
 I still have one for the quarter 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.480
 little flour on the title it 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.460
 given to make it easier to distribute 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.210
 leaves because then also very easy 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.340
 I was with 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.300
 if the train was lively it could too 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.310
 again for half an hour 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.960
 The wrapped foil also wrapped 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.420
 even then stuck my fridge just then 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.550
 Definitely not the dough me 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.670
 was the dough now with man 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.110
 coat apricot jam you can 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.220
 also use other jams and 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.590
 you have a little different taste 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.750
 What she may hold I have one 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.340
 earn a bit in the microwave 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.340
 to make it easier to pass 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:54.490
 you need yours now for the strike 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.380
 sugar I will pulverize now 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.240
 imam thermic sunny cani thermik sub 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.550
 you can use powdered sugar directly 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.290
 or you can also use sugar 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.920
 would also be more accurate with powdered cindy 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.110
 street a bit better I suppose 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.640
 I do not like powdered sugar because I like mine 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.110
 sideline thermomix has I can 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.120
 that always pulverize 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.320
 and it is also cheaper 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.700
 That's why I rarely have 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:23.250
 powdered sugar at home in which on stage 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.250
 10 10 seconds pulverized 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.910
 if you are in your thermic powdered sugar 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.740
 you have to take care of yourself 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.090
 because that's pretty dusty 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.470
 developed and when he the lid too 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.850
 soon all the dust will open 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.410
 that's why always come along 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.870
 wait a bit until the dust 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.450
 has laid 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:50.550
 there are still up to 300 grams of flour 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:53.460
 and 170 capo with it 3 I now have the 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:56.160
 butter and flour with pure and given 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:58.140
 thermomix on 25 seconds level 5 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.150
 set so it looks now looks 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.440
 not like having roads now with 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.480
 still form the hands 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.790
 before you get the sprinkles 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.990
 it goes bad your dough still a 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.990
 bit with a fork a 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:27.740
 Can you talk about the bouquets I 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.720
 have my street distributed here if 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.220
 you wonder what with the milk 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.590
 happened we would have a fire yet 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.210
 can pass on the dough 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.979
 but you do not have to be that too 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.060
 the file is a bit juicier 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:40.430
 but we have apricot jam 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.919
 taken and then it is also juicy 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:46.760
 enough in between and so can now 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:47.900
 at 200 degrees so heated about 20 to 30 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.760
 minutes in the oven you are really 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.699
 take care that the sprinkles are not 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.620
 burn to look the sockets day 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:58.070
 now finished baked off 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.930
 you have now been cut 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:06.490
 that's why i'm removing it from the back now 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:06.490
