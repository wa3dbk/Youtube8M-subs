oh<00:00:00.500> you<00:00:01.500> guys<00:00:01.680> I'm<00:00:02.010> officially<00:00:02.550> a<00:00:02.580> dork<00:00:02.970> I<00:00:03.330> had

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
oh you guys I'm officially a dork I had

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.579 
oh you guys I'm officially a dork I had
my<00:00:04.850> ram<00:00:05.850> chips<00:00:06.210> both<00:00:06.480> on<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:06.779> same<00:00:06.810> channel

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
my ram chips both on the same channel

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.070 
my ram chips both on the same channel
because<00:00:08.370> this<00:00:08.790> board<00:00:09.090> had<00:00:09.240> sockets<00:00:09.780> arranged

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
because this board had sockets arranged

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.600 
because this board had sockets arranged
little<00:00:10.320> differently<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:11.010> I<00:00:11.099> couldn't<00:00:11.340> read

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
little differently and I couldn't read

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.039 
little differently and I couldn't read
it<00:00:11.790> and<00:00:12.019> the<00:00:13.019> manual<00:00:14.210> basically<00:00:15.210> confused<00:00:15.929> me

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
it and the manual basically confused me

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.480 
it and the manual basically confused me
when<00:00:16.199> I<00:00:16.289> was<00:00:16.410> working<00:00:16.619> tired<00:00:17.070> putting<00:00:17.430> the

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
when I was working tired putting the

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.060 
when I was working tired putting the
system<00:00:17.880> together<00:00:18.199> the<00:00:19.199> base<00:00:19.410> game<00:00:19.439> just<00:00:19.949> a

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
system together the base game just a

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.939 
system together the base game just a
dark<00:00:20.689> so<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:21.720> was<00:00:21.900> only<00:00:21.990> running<00:00:22.230> my<00:00:22.470> memory<00:00:22.769> in

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
dark so I was only running my memory in

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.250 
dark so I was only running my memory in
single<00:00:23.340> channel<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:23.930> didn't<00:00:24.930> even<00:00:25.019> notice

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
single channel I didn't even notice

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.370 
single channel I didn't even notice
until<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.769> loaded<00:00:26.130> up<00:00:26.340> AMD<00:00:27.150> overdrive<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:28.109> it

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
until I loaded up AMD overdrive and it

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.080 
until I loaded up AMD overdrive and it
said<00:00:28.590> single<00:00:29.070> channel<00:00:29.490> on<00:00:29.580> there<00:00:29.760> I'm<00:00:29.880> like

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
said single channel on there I'm like

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.590 
said single channel on there I'm like
what<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.330> heck<00:00:30.859> so<00:00:31.859> I<00:00:32.189> put<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.790> move<00:00:33.420> the

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
what the heck so I put it to move the

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.889 
what the heck so I put it to move the
chip<00:00:33.809> over<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.260> proper<00:00:34.620> socket<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.250> now

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 
chip over to the proper socket and now

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.280 
chip over to the proper socket and now
the<00:00:36.899> system<00:00:37.320> booted<00:00:37.710> up<00:00:37.920> at<00:00:38.930> 1866<00:00:39.930> like<00:00:40.140> it

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
the system booted up at 1866 like it

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.220 
the system booted up at 1866 like it
should<00:00:41.090> I'm<00:00:42.090> going<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.329> do<00:00:42.420> some<00:00:42.660> more<00:00:42.809> testing

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
should I'm going to do some more testing

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.590 
should I'm going to do some more testing
and<00:00:43.890> see<00:00:44.370> if<00:00:44.520> it's<00:00:44.640> totally<00:00:45.000> stable<00:00:45.239> but<00:00:45.539> I

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
and see if it's totally stable but I

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.330 
and see if it's totally stable but I
have<00:00:45.780> not<00:00:45.989> even<00:00:46.230> increased<00:00:46.920> any<00:00:47.129> of<00:00:47.250> the

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
have not even increased any of the

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.729 
have not even increased any of the
voltages<00:00:47.820> everything<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.660> on<00:00:48.870> automatic<00:00:49.820> so

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
voltages everything is on automatic so

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:53.720 
voltages everything is on automatic so
it's<00:00:52.739> going<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.920> be<00:00:52.980> really<00:00:53.160> cool<00:00:53.430> if<00:00:53.489> this

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
it's going to be really cool if this

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.510 
it's going to be really cool if this
ends<00:00:54.000> up<00:00:54.059> working<00:00:54.530> I'm<00:00:55.530> going<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.770> rerun<00:00:56.160> the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
ends up working I'm going to rerun the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.310 
ends up working I'm going to rerun the
windows<00:00:57.210> benchmark<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.930> see<00:00:58.109> what<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.320> get<00:00:58.530> now

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
windows benchmark and see what I get now

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.100 
windows benchmark and see what I get now
well<00:01:01.320> my<00:01:01.469> ram<00:01:01.739> went<00:01:02.039> up<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.250> point<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.730> 7.7<00:01:03.660> it

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
well my ram went up a point to 7.7 it

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.969 
well my ram went up a point to 7.7 it
was<00:01:04.290> at<00:01:04.439> 7.6<00:01:05.159> before<00:01:06.020> so<00:01:07.020> just<00:01:07.439> like<00:01:07.950> before

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
was at 7.6 before so just like before

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.750 
was at 7.6 before so just like before
the<00:01:08.760> CPU<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.510> weak<00:01:09.659> point<00:01:09.960> again<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.760> think

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
the CPU is the weak point again I think

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.260 
the CPU is the weak point again I think
it's<00:01:11.880> time<00:01:12.090> for<00:01:12.390> some<00:01:12.540> overclocking<00:01:12.900> i<00:01:14.240> bet<00:01:15.240> i

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
it's time for some overclocking i bet i

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.999 
it's time for some overclocking i bet i
can<00:01:15.450> hit<00:01:15.570> 4<00:01:15.869> gigahertz<00:01:16.229> on<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:16.770> thing<00:01:16.979> easy

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
can hit 4 gigahertz on this thing easy

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.740 
can hit 4 gigahertz on this thing easy
although<00:01:20.009> it's<00:01:20.460> about<00:01:20.759> four<00:01:21.150> thirty<00:01:21.479> in<00:01:21.659> the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
although it's about four thirty in the

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.179 
although it's about four thirty in the
morning<00:01:21.810> i'm<00:01:22.229> debating<00:01:22.380> whether<00:01:22.830> i<00:01:22.920> want<00:01:23.130> to

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
morning i'm debating whether i want to

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.840 
morning i'm debating whether i want to
try<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.520> right<00:01:23.700> now<00:01:23.759> or<00:01:23.970> not<00:01:25.850> mmm<00:01:28.850> maybe

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
try it right now or not mmm maybe

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.819 
try it right now or not mmm maybe
tomorrow<00:01:30.329> after<00:01:30.450> after<00:01:31.110> i<00:01:31.170> do<00:01:31.229> some<00:01:31.560> stability

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
tomorrow after after i do some stability

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.870 
tomorrow after after i do some stability
testing<00:01:32.520> i'm<00:01:32.790> pretty<00:01:33.060> doggone<00:01:33.450> tired<00:01:34.880> another

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
testing i'm pretty doggone tired another

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.999 
testing i'm pretty doggone tired another
thing<00:01:36.180> i<00:01:36.619> read<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:38.220> can<00:01:38.400> do<00:01:39.320> is<00:01:40.320> run<00:01:40.979> the

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
thing i read you can do is run the

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.999 
thing i read you can do is run the
command<00:01:41.610> prompt<00:01:41.970> as<00:01:42.060> administrator<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:43.079> type

wince<00:01:44.399> at<00:01:44.700> mem<00:01:45.799> and<00:01:46.799> there's<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.189> memory<00:01:47.909> test

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
wince at mem and there's a memory test

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.069 
wince at mem and there's a memory test
built<00:01:48.360> right<00:01:48.540> in<00:01:48.689> there<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.200> i<00:01:49.470> got<00:01:50.810> 20<00:01:51.810> gigs

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
built right in there and i got 20 gigs

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.950 
built right in there and i got 20 gigs
per<00:01:52.380> second<00:01:52.890> on<00:01:53.700> memory<00:01:54.210> which<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.540> right

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
per second on memory which is right

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.560 
per second on memory which is right
about<00:01:55.140> where<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.409> should<00:01:55.560> be<00:01:55.680> for<00:01:55.890> ddr3<00:01:56.570> 1866

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
about where it should be for ddr3 1866

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.560 
about where it should be for ddr3 1866
actually<00:01:58.200> it's<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.380> little<00:01:58.619> up<00:01:59.520> there<00:01:59.570> little

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
actually it's a little up there little

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.399 
actually it's a little up there little
over<00:02:00.719> so<00:02:01.320> can't<00:02:01.890> complain<00:02:02.009> about<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:03.409> not

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
over so can't complain about that not

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.280 
over so can't complain about that not
really<00:02:04.590> sure<00:02:04.850> how<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.909> speed<00:02:06.450> works<00:02:07.020> in

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
really sure how the speed works in

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.840 
really sure how the speed works in
