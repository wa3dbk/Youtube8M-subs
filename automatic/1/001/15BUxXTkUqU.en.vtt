00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.970
New rumors provide additional details on Microsoft's
next Xbox.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.110
An in-depth report from veteran tech blogger
Paul Thurrott on Windows IT Pro elaborates

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.640
on several topics including the next Xbox's
pricing, release date, operating system, and

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.640
more.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.079
According to Thurrott, previous rumors that
there will be two versions of the next Xbox

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:22.669
are no longer accurate.

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:26.320
He notes that Microsoft "originally planned
to offer both a 'full' version of the next

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.579
Xbox (with video game playing capabilities)
and a lower-end entertainment-oriented version,

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.190
code-named 'Yuma,' that didn't provide gaming
capabilities."

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.660
However, "plans for Yuma are on hold, and
no pure entertainment version of the next

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.350
Xbox will appear in 2013 (or possibly ever)."

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.790
That rumored and controversial "always online"
functionality of the next Xbox is apparently

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:46.790
correct.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.239
He says that "the next Xbox must be Internet-connected
to use."

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.429
But, he adds that it isn't as Draconian as
many seem to believe."

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:55.739
He reiterates that "Microsoft will initially
offer two pricing models for the console:

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.920
a standalone version for $499 and a $299 version
that requires a two-year Xbox LIVE Gold commitment

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.750
at an expected price of $10 per month."

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.100
The system will apparently launch in early
November this year.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.610
Building on rumors that Windows 8 could power
the next Xbox, Thurrott writes that the system

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.820
is "based on the 'Core' version of Windows
8.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.350
This suggests a common apps platform or at
least one that is similar to that used by

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.479
Windows 8."

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.719
He also believes that Microsoft "could open
up this platform to enthusiast developers"

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:25.360
and reports that the company "will discuss
the next Xbox developer platform at the Build

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.890
conference in San Francisco in late June."

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.010
That would be good news, because Microsoft's
restrictive policies this generation have

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.159
scared off some independent developers.

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.659
Thurrott also confirmed previous rumors that
the next Xbox will include a Blu-Ray drive.

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.420
The name of the console is apparently still
a big area of speculation.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.579
But Thurrott agrees with several of us here
at IGN that it might simply be called Xbox.

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:47.450
Whatever it's called, it will be revealed
on May 21.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.050
You can watch the reveal live on IGN, along
with pre- and post-show commentary and analysis.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.320
Finally, Thurrott notes that beyond the initial
announcement on May 21st, Microsoft "will

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.810
fully reveal details about the next Xbox,
including the launch lineup of games" at its

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.570
E3 press conference on June 10th.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.590
We'll continue reporting everything we learn
about the next Xbox right here at IGN.
