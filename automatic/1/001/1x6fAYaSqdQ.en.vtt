the area that is going to be the sky

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.670 
the area that is going to be the sky
we're<00:00:46.100> going<00:00:46.280> to<00:00:46.430> rub<00:00:47.020> some<00:00:48.020> of<00:00:48.050> this<00:00:48.170> whites

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
we're going to rub some of this whites

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.430 
we're going to rub some of this whites
all<00:00:49.070> across<00:00:52.059> this<00:00:53.059> white<00:00:53.329> won't<00:00:53.960> have<00:00:54.199> any

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
all across this white won't have any

special effect on the final color makes

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.250 
special effect on the final color makes
it<00:00:58.160> it<00:00:59.000> doesn't<00:00:59.180> really<00:00:59.359> have<00:00:59.660> a<00:00:59.690> tinting

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
it it doesn't really have a tinting

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.279 
it it doesn't really have a tinting
power<00:01:01.090> but<00:01:02.090> it<00:01:02.180> will<00:01:02.359> help<00:01:02.600> to<00:01:02.840> spread<00:01:03.140> the

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:03.289 
power but it will help to spread the

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:06.240 
power but it will help to spread the
colors<00:01:03.620> more<00:01:03.829> evenly

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:15.490

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
okay so we're kind of ready then with a

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.990 
okay so we're kind of ready then with a
smooth<00:01:15.830> brush<00:01:16.130> we're<00:01:16.700> going<00:01:16.910> to<00:01:17.060> smoothen<00:01:17.570> out

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
smooth brush we're going to smoothen out

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.220 
smooth brush we're going to smoothen out
some<00:01:20.000> of<00:01:20.090> the<00:01:20.210> excesses<00:01:20.570> we're<00:01:20.930> going<00:01:21.080> to

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.230

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.030 
some of the excesses we're going to
remove

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:35.050 

wherever<00:01:25.040> is<00:01:25.250> too<00:01:25.460> much

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.700 

I'm<00:01:36.060> trying<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.420> mimic<00:01:36.660> some<00:01:36.870> of<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.320> orange

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
I'm trying to mimic some of the orange

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.690 
I'm trying to mimic some of the orange
that<00:01:37.830> I<00:01:38.040> see<00:01:38.370> down<00:01:38.610> there<00:01:40.250> which<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.430> going<00:01:41.610> to

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
that I see down there which is going to

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.180 
that I see down there which is going to
start<00:01:42.120> just<00:01:42.660> about<00:01:43.080> here<00:01:45.500> your<00:01:46.500> painting<00:01:46.950> can

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
start just about here your painting can

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.210 
start just about here your painting can
be<00:01:47.220> your<00:01:47.670> palettes<00:01:48.120> so<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.750> can<00:01:48.960> mix<00:01:49.220> directly

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
be your palettes so you can mix directly

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.900 
be your palettes so you can mix directly
on<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.270> canvas<00:01:52.160> you<00:01:53.160> don't<00:01:53.370> need<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.730> bring

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
on the canvas you don't need to bring

00:01:53.910 --> 00:02:02.380 
on the canvas you don't need to bring
mix<00:01:54.150> everything<00:01:54.480> all<00:01:55.260> the<00:01:55.530> time

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.100 

and<00:02:03.230> as<00:02:03.530> much<00:02:03.710> with<00:02:03.920> everything<00:02:04.190> else<00:02:05.110> nature

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
and as much with everything else nature

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.480 
and as much with everything else nature
tends<00:02:06.380> to<00:02:06.470> be<00:02:06.650> a<00:02:06.680> bit<00:02:06.830> more<00:02:07.010> unpredictable

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
tends to be a bit more unpredictable

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.419 
tends to be a bit more unpredictable
than<00:02:08.030> people<00:02:08.479> so<00:02:08.810> it's<00:02:08.990> important<00:02:09.530> to<00:02:09.649> to

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
than people so it's important to to

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.650 
than people so it's important to to
paint<00:02:10.700> and<00:02:11.710> evenly<00:02:12.760> don't<00:02:13.760> try<00:02:13.940> to<00:02:14.000> make<00:02:14.240> it<00:02:14.420> to

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
paint and evenly don't try to make it to

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.590 
paint and evenly don't try to make it to
needs<00:02:14.930> and<00:02:15.350> to<00:02:15.500> straights<00:02:16.240> because<00:02:17.240> it's<00:02:17.420> just

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
needs and to straights because it's just

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.280 
needs and to straights because it's just
not<00:02:17.870> going<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:18.260> work<00:02:22.540> as<00:02:23.540> you<00:02:23.720> start<00:02:24.020> adding

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
not going to work as you start adding

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.550 
not going to work as you start adding
some<00:02:24.650> more<00:02:24.800> dramatic<00:02:25.370> shades<00:02:29.320> the<00:02:30.320> brush

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
some more dramatic shades the brush

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.610 
some more dramatic shades the brush
movements<00:02:31.250> are<00:02:31.520> elongated<00:02:32.360> because<00:02:33.350> that's

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
movements are elongated because that's

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.070 
movements are elongated because that's
the<00:02:33.800> shape<00:02:34.010> of<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.370> clouds<00:02:34.640> that<00:02:34.940> we<00:02:35.209> we<00:02:35.900> have

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
the shape of the clouds that we we have

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.790 
the shape of the clouds that we we have
in<00:02:36.200> front<00:02:36.440> of<00:02:36.560> us<00:02:36.740> on<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.130> image<00:02:37.450> so<00:02:38.620> first<00:02:39.620> you

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
in front of us on the image so first you

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.170 
in front of us on the image so first you
start<00:02:39.830> by<00:02:40.480> quickly<00:02:41.480> drafting<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:44.000> main

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
start by quickly drafting the main

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.560 
start by quickly drafting the main
shapes<00:02:45.040> don't<00:02:46.040> worry<00:02:46.280> with<00:02:46.850> details<00:02:47.300> it

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
shapes don't worry with details it

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.720 
shapes don't worry with details it
details<00:02:48.080> will<00:02:48.260> all<00:02:48.440> be<00:02:48.680> added<00:02:49.040> towards<00:02:49.550> the

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
details will all be added towards the

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.560 
details will all be added towards the
end<00:02:49.880> of<00:02:50.030> the<00:02:50.180> painting<00:02:52.120> for<00:02:53.120> now<00:02:53.270> it's<00:02:53.480> just

end of the painting for now it's just

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.770

the main bits now as it's going along
what<00:03:07.280> n<00:03:07.430> you<00:03:07.520> need<00:03:07.640> to<00:03:07.820> do<00:03:07.970> is<00:03:08.300> get<00:03:08.720> back<00:03:08.900> to

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
what n you need to do is get back to

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.980 
what n you need to do is get back to
your<00:03:09.350> flat<00:03:09.950> brush<00:03:10.280> and<00:03:10.660> it's<00:03:11.660> time<00:03:11.960> to<00:03:12.740> start

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
your flat brush and it's time to start

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.760 
your flat brush and it's time to start
smoothing<00:03:14.990> it<00:03:15.410> out<00:03:16.570> so<00:03:17.570> at<00:03:18.020> this<00:03:18.230> stage<00:03:18.500> you

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
smoothing it out so at this stage you

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.900 
smoothing it out so at this stage you
don't<00:03:18.890> want<00:03:19.130> too<00:03:19.430> much<00:03:19.610> of<00:03:20.060> a<00:03:20.350> streaky<00:03:21.910> color

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
don't want too much of a streaky color

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.930 
don't want too much of a streaky color
effect<00:03:24.040> you<00:03:25.040> want<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.340> colors<00:03:25.700> to<00:03:25.730> start

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
effect you want the colors to start

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:33.940 
effect you want the colors to start
blending<00:03:26.420> a<00:03:27.190> little<00:03:28.190> bit<00:03:28.340> more<00:03:32.680> again<00:03:33.680> later

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
blending a little bit more again later

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.900 
blending a little bit more again later
on<00:03:34.100> you'll<00:03:34.430> be<00:03:34.490> able<00:03:34.580> to<00:03:34.940> do<00:03:35.090> much<00:03:35.330> sharper

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
on you'll be able to do much sharper

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.770 
on you'll be able to do much sharper
much<00:03:37.910> much<00:03:38.210> sharper<00:03:38.540> color<00:03:38.930> effects<00:03:39.470> for<00:03:39.710> now

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
much much sharper color effects for now

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.940 
much much sharper color effects for now
this<00:03:41.780> is<00:03:41.840> what<00:03:42.170> you<00:03:42.350> should<00:03:42.410> aim<00:03:42.680> for<00:03:44.830> and<00:03:45.830> now

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
this is what you should aim for and now

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.460 
this is what you should aim for and now
it's<00:03:46.160> time<00:03:46.430> to<00:03:46.700> start<00:03:47.570> adding<00:03:47.840> some<00:03:48.200> of<00:03:48.350> the

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
it's time to start adding some of the

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
it's time to start adding some of the
shadows

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.580 

again<00:03:52.490> don't<00:03:52.730> worry<00:03:52.880> with<00:03:53.510> detail<00:03:53.900> initially

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
again don't worry with detail initially

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.640 
again don't worry with detail initially
you<00:03:54.710> just<00:03:54.920> need<00:03:55.160> to<00:03:55.630> sketch<00:03:56.630> in<00:03:56.900> where<00:03:57.530> the

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
you just need to sketch in where the

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:03.460 
you just need to sketch in where the
colors<00:03:57.920> are<00:03:58.100> going<00:03:58.280> to<00:03:58.370> be<00:04:00.910> you're<00:04:01.910> not<00:04:02.470> making

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
colors are going to be you're not making

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.670 
colors are going to be you're not making
any<00:04:03.620> type<00:04:03.950> of<00:04:06.430> precise<00:04:07.430> painting<00:04:08.000> in<00:04:08.180> here

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
any type of precise painting in here

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.950 
any type of precise painting in here
it's<00:04:09.680> just<00:04:09.860> a<00:04:09.980> quick<00:04:10.160> draft<00:04:10.840> remember<00:04:11.840> that

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:11.960 
it's just a quick draft remember that

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.750 
it's just a quick draft remember that
the<00:04:12.080> top<00:04:12.320> clouds<00:04:12.620> tend<00:04:12.950> to<00:04:13.100> be<00:04:13.250> much<00:04:13.460> faster

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
the top clouds tend to be much faster

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.539 
the top clouds tend to be much faster
and<00:04:14.270> larger<00:04:14.450> than<00:04:14.840> the<00:04:14.960> bottom<00:04:15.140> ones<00:04:15.549> because

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
and larger than the bottom ones because

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.840 
and larger than the bottom ones because
the<00:04:16.670> top<00:04:16.850> clouds<00:04:17.120> are<00:04:17.269> nearer<00:04:18.400> so<00:04:19.400> due<00:04:19.700> to

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
the top clouds are nearer so due to

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.900 
the top clouds are nearer so due to
perspective<00:04:20.120> it's<00:04:20.780> important<00:04:21.380> to<00:04:21.560> paint<00:04:21.910> the

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
perspective it's important to paint the

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.620 
perspective it's important to paint the
lower<00:04:23.090> ones<00:04:23.450> a<00:04:23.780> little<00:04:24.170> bit<00:04:24.320> finer<00:04:25.420> than<00:04:26.420> you

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
lower ones a little bit finer than you

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.210 
lower ones a little bit finer than you
you're<00:04:27.080> going<00:04:27.350> to<00:04:27.530> do<00:04:27.680> with<00:04:27.830> the<00:04:27.950> top<00:04:28.190> ones

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
you're going to do with the top ones

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:37.360 
you're going to do with the top ones
somehow<00:04:31.220> more<00:04:31.430> elongated<00:04:31.880> Israel

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.220 

in<00:04:38.370> order<00:04:38.580> to<00:04:38.730> finish<00:04:38.940> your<00:04:39.240> sunset<00:04:39.690> painting

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
in order to finish your sunset painting

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.920 
in order to finish your sunset painting
you<00:04:40.590> would<00:04:40.740> need<00:04:40.920> to<00:04:41.360> bear<00:04:42.360> in<00:04:42.480> mind<00:04:42.510> that

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
you would need to bear in mind that

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.050 
you would need to bear in mind that
clouds<00:04:43.770> have<00:04:44.220> hard<00:04:44.910> edges<00:04:45.180> and<00:04:45.630> soft<00:04:46.140> edges<00:04:47.100> so

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
clouds have hard edges and soft edges so

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.960 
clouds have hard edges and soft edges so
some<00:04:48.420> of<00:04:48.450> them<00:04:48.870> especially<00:04:49.530> the<00:04:49.950> upper<00:04:50.070> sides

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
some of them especially the upper sides

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.700 
some of them especially the upper sides
of<00:04:51.120> the<00:04:51.240> clouds<00:04:51.540> tend<00:04:51.990> to<00:04:52.140> be<00:04:52.260> maybe<00:04:52.500> a<00:04:52.590> bit

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
of the clouds tend to be maybe a bit

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.710 
of the clouds tend to be maybe a bit
more<00:04:52.740> hazy<00:04:53.130> more<00:04:53.490> blurry<00:04:53.760> as<00:04:54.090> they<00:04:54.240> go<00:04:54.360> in<00:04:54.510> the

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
more hazy more blurry as they go in the

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.620 
more hazy more blurry as they go in the
shadow<00:04:55.040> the<00:04:56.040> lower<00:04:56.220> ones<00:04:56.520> are<00:04:56.730> facing<00:04:57.270> the<00:04:57.360> Sun

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
shadow the lower ones are facing the Sun

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.360 
shadow the lower ones are facing the Sun
they<00:04:57.960> tend<00:04:58.200> to<00:04:58.230> have<00:04:58.410> much<00:04:58.590> crisper<00:04:59.900> outlines

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
they tend to have much crisper outlines

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.460 
they tend to have much crisper outlines
also<00:05:02.370> remember<00:05:02.850> that<00:05:03.030> clouds<00:05:03.690> that<00:05:04.080> are<00:05:04.140> on

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
also remember that clouds that are on

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.450 
also remember that clouds that are on
the<00:05:04.650> top<00:05:04.950> of<00:05:05.160> the<00:05:05.550> image<00:05:05.750> they're<00:05:06.750> much<00:05:06.930> nearer

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
the top of the image they're much nearer

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.340 
the top of the image they're much nearer
which<00:05:08.460> means<00:05:08.730> they're<00:05:08.880> larger<00:05:09.270> in<00:05:09.390> size<00:05:09.600> cause

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
which means they're larger in size cause

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.530 
which means they're larger in size cause
there<00:05:10.590> are<00:05:10.710> further<00:05:10.980> back<00:05:11.390> they're<00:05:12.390> much

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
there are further back they're much

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.750 
there are further back they're much
smaller<00:05:12.840> and<00:05:13.200> elongated<00:05:13.740> and<00:05:14.130> you<00:05:14.190> will

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
smaller and elongated and you will

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.970 
smaller and elongated and you will
definitely<00:05:15.000> need<00:05:15.650> hundreds<00:05:16.650> if<00:05:16.920> not

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
definitely need hundreds if not

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.450 
definitely need hundreds if not
thousands<00:05:17.910> of<00:05:18.090> different<00:05:18.510> tones<00:05:18.870> and<00:05:19.170> colors

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
thousands of different tones and colors

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.910 
thousands of different tones and colors
don't<00:05:20.460> keep<00:05:20.760> it<00:05:20.910> simple<00:05:21.360> the<00:05:21.930> sunset<00:05:22.470> is<00:05:22.710> one

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:22.920 
don't keep it simple the sunset is one

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.160 
don't keep it simple the sunset is one
of<00:05:23.100> nature's<00:05:23.490> most<00:05:23.850> spectacular<00:05:24.240> color

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:25.170 
of nature's most spectacular color

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:29.240 
of nature's most spectacular color
displays<00:05:25.820> and<00:05:27.410> that<00:05:28.410> is<00:05:28.560> how<00:05:28.740> you<00:05:28.800> paint<00:05:29.100> the

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
displays and that is how you paint the

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.790 
displays and that is how you paint the
sunset
