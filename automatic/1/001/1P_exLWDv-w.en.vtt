day so it's very easy to make first

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.620 
day so it's very easy to make first
she's<00:00:49.620> we<00:00:49.890> start<00:00:50.220> off<00:00:50.400> with<00:00:50.610> some<00:00:50.880> raw<00:00:51.030> cashews

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:51.630

she's we start off with some raw cashews
which<00:00:52.020> look<00:00:52.320> like<00:00:52.350> this<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:54.180> have<00:00:54.210> to

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
which look like this and you have to

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.810 
which look like this and you have to
grind<00:00:55.140> them<00:00:55.410> in<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.680> food<00:00:55.860> processor<00:00:56.040> a<00:00:56.489> dry

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
grind them in a food processor a dry

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.510 
grind them in a food processor a dry
food<00:00:57.060> processor<00:00:57.690> until<00:00:58.050> they're<00:00:58.350> not<00:00:59.070> powdery

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
food processor until they're not powdery

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.920 
food processor until they're not powdery
but<00:00:59.850> very<00:01:00.270> finely<00:01:00.660> ground<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:02.450> that<00:01:03.450> helps<00:01:03.780> it

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
but very finely ground and that helps it

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.230 
but very finely ground and that helps it
be<00:01:04.530> very<00:01:04.769> smooth<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.640> we're<00:01:05.790> gonna<00:01:05.880> pretend

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
be very smooth so we're gonna pretend

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
that we just did this in the food

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.260 
that we just did this in the food
processor<00:01:08.280> I'm<00:01:08.399> gonna<00:01:08.549> put<00:01:08.729> them<00:01:08.880> back<00:01:09.030> in

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
processor I'm gonna put them back in

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.270 
processor I'm gonna put them back in
here<00:01:09.570> but<00:01:10.320> remember<00:01:10.770> when<00:01:10.920> you're<00:01:11.100> grinding

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
here but remember when you're grinding

of silken tofu if I went the whole box I
just<00:01:32.819> cut<00:01:32.969> it<00:01:32.999> in<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.329> middle<00:01:33.600> if<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:34.289> want<00:01:34.560> part

of it I cut it wherever it's about a cup
and<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.679> half<00:01:37.709> in<00:01:38.100> here<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.579> can<00:01:38.670> divide<00:01:39.060> it

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:39.209 
and a half in here so you can divide it

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:40.849 
and a half in here so you can divide it
into<00:01:39.359> thirds<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.899> you<00:01:40.229> know<00:01:40.350> we're<00:01:40.499> 1/2<00:01:40.770> a

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:40.859 
into thirds and you know we're 1/2 a

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:42.590 
into thirds and you know we're 1/2 a
copyist<00:01:41.340> but<00:01:41.759> anyway<00:01:42.029> we're<00:01:42.149> using<00:01:42.389> the<00:01:42.450> whole

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
copyist but anyway we're using the whole

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.840 
copyist but anyway we're using the whole
thing<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:43.560> just<00:01:43.770> use<00:01:43.889> a<00:01:43.920> bread<00:01:44.189> knife<00:01:44.219> and<00:01:44.670> cut

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
thing so just use a bread knife and cut

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.370 
thing so just use a bread knife and cut
it<00:01:44.969> in<00:01:45.119> half<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:46.279> then<00:01:47.279> we're<00:01:47.700> going<00:01:47.880> to

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
it in half and then we're going to

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.339 
it in half and then we're going to
crumble<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.590> into<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.009> bowl<00:01:50.520> lined<00:01:51.060> with<00:01:51.420> some

layers of it and we're just going to
gather<00:02:05.459> up<00:02:05.639> the<00:02:05.999> ends<00:02:06.539> you<00:02:06.779> can<00:02:07.740> do<00:02:07.829> this<00:02:07.979> over

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
gather up the ends you can do this over

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.339 
gather up the ends you can do this over
the<00:02:08.190> sink<00:02:08.429> if<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:08.759> like<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.209> we're<00:02:10.170> going<00:02:10.289> to

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
the sink if you like and we're going to

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.820 
the sink if you like and we're going to
crumble<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.490> bit<00:02:11.640> in<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.000> side<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.830> then

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
crumble it a bit in the side and then

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.830 
crumble it a bit in the side and then
we're<00:02:13.980> going<00:02:14.099> to<00:02:14.190> squeeze<00:02:14.580> it<00:02:14.880> until

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
we're going to squeeze it until

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.470 
we're going to squeeze it until
see<00:02:16.380> all<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.590> water<00:02:16.709> coming<00:02:16.860> out<00:02:17.220> of<00:02:17.280> there

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
see all the water coming out of there

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.750 
see all the water coming out of there
we're<00:02:18.480> gonna<00:02:18.569> squeeze<00:02:18.930> it<00:02:19.170> until<00:02:19.340> we<00:02:20.340> have<00:02:20.579> no

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
we're gonna squeeze it until we have no

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.490 
we're gonna squeeze it until we have no
more<00:02:20.939> water<00:02:21.269> dripping<00:02:21.750> from<00:02:21.930> it<00:02:22.140> now<00:02:22.230> this

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
more water dripping from it now this

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.370 
more water dripping from it now this
take<00:02:22.650> three<00:02:22.980> or<00:02:23.070> four<00:02:23.100> minutes<00:02:23.610> so<00:02:24.480> we're<00:02:25.260> not

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
take three or four minutes so we're not

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.750 
take three or four minutes so we're not
gonna<00:02:25.500> do<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:25.860> whole<00:02:26.010> thing<00:02:26.040> but<00:02:26.370> that's<00:02:26.520> the

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
gonna do the whole thing but that's the

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.760 
gonna do the whole thing but that's the
general<00:02:27.120> idea<00:02:27.420> just<00:02:28.170> keep<00:02:28.320> doing<00:02:28.590> that<00:02:28.620> until

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
general idea just keep doing that until

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.540 
general idea just keep doing that until
you<00:02:29.190> don't<00:02:29.310> get<00:02:29.580> drips<00:02:30.360> of<00:02:30.510> water<00:02:30.570> anymore<00:02:31.550> so

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
you don't get drips of water anymore so

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.400 
you don't get drips of water anymore so
I'm<00:02:32.700> just<00:02:32.820> gonna<00:02:32.940> put<00:02:33.150> this<00:02:33.270> over<00:02:33.450> here<00:02:33.960> and

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
I'm just gonna put this over here and

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.560 
I'm just gonna put this over here and
this<00:02:35.100> is<00:02:35.280> what<00:02:35.460> it<00:02:35.580> looks<00:02:35.730> like<00:02:35.970> when<00:02:36.360> you've

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
this is what it looks like when you've

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.860 
this is what it looks like when you've
squeezed<00:02:36.960> it<00:02:37.170> it's<00:02:37.440> quite<00:02:37.700> crumbly<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:38.880> dry

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
squeezed it it's quite crumbly and dry

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.680 
squeezed it it's quite crumbly and dry
well<00:02:40.320> not<00:02:40.470> dry<00:02:40.709> but<00:02:40.770> drier<00:02:41.670> than<00:02:41.940> it<00:02:42.060> was<00:02:42.240> so

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
well not dry but drier than it was so

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.940 
well not dry but drier than it was so
we're<00:02:42.780> gonna<00:02:42.870> add<00:02:43.050> that<00:02:43.080> to<00:02:43.350> the<00:02:43.740> ground

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
we're gonna add that to the ground

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.420 
we're gonna add that to the ground
cashews<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:46.080> cashews<00:02:46.530> really<00:02:46.830> add<00:02:46.980> a<00:02:47.010> lot<00:02:47.250> of

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
cashews the cashews really add a lot of

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.170 
cashews the cashews really add a lot of
richness<00:02:47.550> and<00:02:49.130> some<00:02:50.130> of<00:02:50.280> that<00:02:50.370> buttery<00:02:50.760> flavor

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
richness and some of that buttery flavor

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.780 
richness and some of that buttery flavor
that<00:02:51.480> we're<00:02:51.630> after<00:02:52.100> but<00:02:53.100> I'm<00:02:53.250> also<00:02:53.459> going<00:02:53.700> to

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
that we're after but I'm also going to

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.110 
that we're after but I'm also going to
add<00:02:54.000> some<00:02:54.030> Earth<00:02:54.600> Balance<00:02:55.730> this<00:02:56.730> isn't<00:02:57.060> a

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
add some Earth Balance this isn't a

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.910 
add some Earth Balance this isn't a
low-fat<00:02:57.510> spread<00:02:57.900> but<00:02:58.110> it<00:02:58.230> is<00:02:58.410> lower<00:02:58.650> in<00:02:58.890> fat

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
low-fat spread but it is lower in fat

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.750 
low-fat spread but it is lower in fat
and<00:02:59.600> saturated<00:03:00.600> fat<00:03:01.170> than<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.760> original

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
and saturated fat than the original

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.910 
and saturated fat than the original
recipe<00:03:03.239> so<00:03:03.540> it's<00:03:05.090> better<00:03:06.090> for<00:03:06.209> you<00:03:06.600> so<00:03:06.920> we're

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
recipe so it's better for you so we're

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.100 
recipe so it's better for you so we're
just<00:03:07.950> gonna<00:03:08.160> break<00:03:09.030> that<00:03:09.180> into<00:03:09.540> a<00:03:09.570> few<00:03:09.900> pieces

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
just gonna break that into a few pieces

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.979 
just gonna break that into a few pieces
and<00:03:10.489> you<00:03:11.489> want<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:11.820> you<00:03:12.150> want<00:03:12.270> to<00:03:12.390> use<00:03:12.570> cold

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
and you want to you want to use cold

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.080 
and you want to you want to use cold
earth<00:03:13.320> balance<00:03:13.770> don't<00:03:14.370> let<00:03:14.610> it<00:03:14.730> come<00:03:14.850> to<00:03:15.000> room

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
earth balance don't let it come to room

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.490 
earth balance don't let it come to room
temperature<00:03:15.660> because<00:03:15.810> when<00:03:16.140> you're<00:03:16.260> grinding

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
temperature because when you're grinding

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.380 
temperature because when you're grinding
it<00:03:16.860> it<00:03:17.040> kind<00:03:17.280> of<00:03:17.340> warms<00:03:17.640> it<00:03:17.820> up<00:03:17.910> and<00:03:18.150> you<00:03:18.209> don't

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
it it kind of warms it up and you don't

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.160 
it it kind of warms it up and you don't
want<00:03:18.510> it<00:03:18.600> to<00:03:18.720> be<00:03:18.840> too<00:03:19.080> soupy<00:03:20.480> okay<00:03:21.480> and<00:03:21.780> then<00:03:21.989> we

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
want it to be too soupy okay and then we

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.920 
want it to be too soupy okay and then we
add<00:03:22.410> two<00:03:23.310> tablespoons<00:03:23.910> of<00:03:24.150> fresh<00:03:24.510> lemon<00:03:24.900> juice

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
add two tablespoons of fresh lemon juice

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.490 
add two tablespoons of fresh lemon juice
and<00:03:25.350> that's<00:03:25.920> really<00:03:26.220> important<00:03:26.880> because<00:03:27.500> the

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
and that's really important because the

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.229 
and that's really important because the
flavor<00:03:28.769> is<00:03:29.010> much<00:03:29.190> better<00:03:29.459> if<00:03:29.670> you<00:03:29.820> absolutely

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
flavor is much better if you absolutely

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.110 
flavor is much better if you absolutely
can't<00:03:30.959> use<00:03:31.140> fresh<00:03:31.410> lemon<00:03:31.739> juice<00:03:31.769> use<00:03:32.459> a<00:03:32.489> bottle

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
can't use fresh lemon juice use a bottle

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.880 
can't use fresh lemon juice use a bottle
a<00:03:33.209> good<00:03:33.239> bottled<00:03:33.780> organic<00:03:34.230> version<00:03:34.680> because

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
a good bottled organic version because

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.650 
a good bottled organic version because
it<00:03:35.040> tastes<00:03:35.310> better<00:03:35.459> than<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:35.940> supermarket

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
it tastes better than the supermarket

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.009 
it tastes better than the supermarket
version<00:03:37.820> okay<00:03:38.820> just<00:03:39.090> put<00:03:39.239> that<00:03:39.390> in<00:03:39.600> and<00:03:39.870> then

we're gonna use a little salt a little
sea<00:03:42.060> salt<00:03:42.709> which<00:03:43.709> seems<00:03:43.950> to<00:03:44.130> be<00:03:44.280> stuck<00:03:45.680> okay

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
and then we'll just let it go on so it

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:22.170 
and then we'll just let it go on so it
has<00:04:16.209> to<00:04:16.390> go<00:04:16.450> until<00:04:17.019> it's<00:04:17.170> very<00:04:17.290> smooth<00:04:21.180> okay

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
we'll check it now take the lid off I

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.800 
we'll check it now take the lid off I
may<00:04:26.380> have<00:04:26.590> to<00:04:26.800> do<00:04:26.920> it<00:04:27.070> a<00:04:27.220> little<00:04:27.430> longer<00:04:27.810> you
