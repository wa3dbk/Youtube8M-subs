okay<00:00:08.010> so<00:00:08.069> now<00:00:08.370> we're<00:00:08.520> ready<00:00:08.640> to<00:00:08.820> move<00:00:08.970> on<00:00:09.180> a

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
okay so now we're ready to move on a

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.880 
okay so now we're ready to move on a
little<00:00:09.300> bit<00:00:09.660> we've<00:00:10.020> been<00:00:10.140> playing<00:00:10.380> roots<00:00:10.680> and

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:10.890 
little bit we've been playing roots and

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.350 
little bit we've been playing roots and
fifths<00:00:11.070> and<00:00:11.340> starting<00:00:11.850> to<00:00:11.910> play<00:00:12.059> a<00:00:12.090> walking

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
fifths and starting to play a walking

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.260 
fifths and starting to play a walking
bass<00:00:12.719> lines<00:00:13.050> and<00:00:13.490> over<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.639> chord<00:00:14.850> changes

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:15.270 
bass lines and over the chord changes

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.109 
bass lines and over the chord changes
and<00:00:15.770> now<00:00:16.770> what<00:00:17.100> we<00:00:17.190> want<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.460> do<00:00:17.610> is<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.940> begin

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
and now what we want to do is to begin

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.930 
and now what we want to do is to begin
to<00:00:18.300> add<00:00:18.600> some<00:00:19.110> chromatic<00:00:19.940> transitions

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:20.940 
to add some chromatic transitions

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.450 
to add some chromatic transitions
between<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.960> chord<00:00:22.230> changes<00:00:22.740> now<00:00:23.160> what<00:00:23.310> am<00:00:23.400> I

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
between the chord changes now what am I

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.019 
between the chord changes now what am I
talking<00:00:23.820> about

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
talking about

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.150 
talking about
well<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:24.929> just<00:00:24.990> gets<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.380> little<00:00:25.470> boring<00:00:25.769> just

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
well it just gets a little boring just

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.179 
well it just gets a little boring just
to<00:00:26.250> play<00:00:26.429> root<00:00:26.939> fifth<00:00:27.509> root<00:00:27.960> fifth<00:00:28.380> root<00:00:28.769> fifth

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
to play root fifth root fifth root fifth

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.790 
to play root fifth root fifth root fifth
so<00:00:30.029> what<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.210> begin<00:00:30.599> thinking<00:00:31.019> about<00:00:31.259> is<00:00:31.769> how

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
so what I begin thinking about is how

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.590 
so what I begin thinking about is how
can<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.550> play<00:00:33.230> little<00:00:34.430> flourishes<00:00:35.600> between

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
can I play little flourishes between

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.380 
can I play little flourishes between
chord<00:00:37.079> changes<00:00:37.650> that<00:00:38.250> sort<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:38.640> lead<00:00:38.970> me<00:00:39.000> into

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
chord changes that sort of lead me into

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.600 
chord changes that sort of lead me into
that<00:00:39.630> chord<00:00:39.930> change<00:00:39.990> really<00:00:40.470> nicely<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.160> they

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
that chord change really nicely and they

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.730 
that chord change really nicely and they
don't<00:00:41.880> necessarily<00:00:42.030> fall<00:00:42.870> into<00:00:43.380> the<00:00:43.500> root

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:43.740 
don't necessarily fall into the root

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.070 
don't necessarily fall into the root
fifth<00:00:44.070> pattern<00:00:44.610> but<00:00:45.210> some<00:00:45.390> things<00:00:45.570> they<00:00:45.750> fit

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:46.080 
fifth pattern but some things they fit

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.110 
fifth pattern but some things they fit
in<00:00:46.290> this<00:00:46.470> hand<00:00:46.890> pattern<00:00:47.220> really<00:00:47.730> really

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
in this hand pattern really really

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.180 
in this hand pattern really really
nicely<00:00:48.330> you<00:00:48.990> know<00:00:49.020> we're<00:00:49.560> really<00:00:49.680> keeping<00:00:49.920> our

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
nicely you know we're really keeping our

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.780 
nicely you know we're really keeping our
hand<00:00:50.430> blocked<00:00:50.880> out<00:00:51.120> like<00:00:51.360> this<00:00:51.630> and<00:00:52.310> and<00:00:53.310> and

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
hand blocked out like this and and and

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.360 
hand blocked out like this and and and
knowing<00:00:54.660> where<00:00:54.900> root<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.440> all<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.950> time<00:00:56.190> with

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
knowing where root is all the time with

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.430 
knowing where root is all the time with
our<00:00:56.400> index<00:00:56.850> finger<00:00:57.060> fifth<00:00:57.630> with<00:00:57.840> pinky<00:00:58.140> finger

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
our index finger fifth with pinky finger

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.200 
our index finger fifth with pinky finger
let<00:00:59.040> me<00:00:59.100> just<00:00:59.280> show<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.490> a<00:00:59.640> little<00:00:59.850> bit<00:00:59.970> about

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
let me just show you a little bit about

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.100 
let me just show you a little bit about
what<00:01:00.390> I'm<00:01:00.480> talking<00:01:00.660> about

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
what I'm talking about

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.950 
what I'm talking about
if<00:01:01.710> I'm<00:01:01.950> transitioning<00:01:02.670> between<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.480> B<00:01:03.720> flat

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
if I'm transitioning between the B flat

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
if I'm transitioning between the B flat
chord<00:01:08.240> and<00:01:09.240> now<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:10.020> want<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.350> get<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.799> the

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:10.980 
chord and now I want to get to the

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.650 
chord and now I want to get to the
e-flat<00:01:11.880> chord<00:01:13.100> well<00:01:14.100> if<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.880> happen<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.270> find

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 
e-flat chord well if I happen to find

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.890 
e-flat chord well if I happen to find
myself<00:01:16.100> find<00:01:17.100> on<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.490> fifth<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.480> B<00:01:18.630> flat

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
myself find on the fifth of the B flat

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.840 
myself find on the fifth of the B flat
chord<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.470> sounds<00:01:20.010> really<00:01:20.190> cool<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.640> go<00:01:20.790> and

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
chord it sounds really cool to go and

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.910 
chord it sounds really cool to go and
kind<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:23.909> walk<00:01:24.210> down<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.690> that<00:01:24.930> E<00:01:25.290> flat<00:01:25.560> chord

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
kind of walk down to that E flat chord

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.270 
kind of walk down to that E flat chord
as<00:01:26.159> long<00:01:26.940> as<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.300> play<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:28.170> E<00:01:28.200> flat<00:01:28.530> on<00:01:29.190> the

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
as long as I play the E flat on the

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.490 
as long as I play the E flat on the
downbeat<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.540> measure<00:01:30.780> where<00:01:31.080> it<00:01:31.230> comes

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
downbeat of the measure where it comes

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.770 
downbeat of the measure where it comes
I'm<00:01:31.860> going<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.550> be<00:01:32.640> in<00:01:32.790> good<00:01:32.940> shape<00:01:33.000> as<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.480> bass

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
I'm going to be in good shape as a bass

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.260 
I'm going to be in good shape as a bass
player<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.320> I'm<00:01:34.950> focusing<00:01:35.550> on<00:01:35.700> root<00:01:35.970> fifth

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
player so I'm focusing on root fifth

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.450 
player so I'm focusing on root fifth
root<00:01:36.510> fifth<00:01:36.870> but<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.620> little<00:01:37.979> something

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
root fifth but a little something

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.240 
root fifth but a little something
special<00:01:38.580> in<00:01:39.150> between<00:01:39.810> moving<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.010> next

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
special in between moving to the next

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.390 
special in between moving to the next
chord<00:01:41.460> change<00:01:41.760> can<00:01:42.420> really<00:01:43.050> be<00:01:43.170> effective<00:01:43.400> so

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
chord change can really be effective so

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.730 
chord change can really be effective so
let<00:01:45.060> me<00:01:45.120> show<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.300> what<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:45.570> mean<00:01:45.900> as<00:01:46.110> we<00:01:46.590> go

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
let me show you what I mean as we go

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.460 
let me show you what I mean as we go
through<00:01:47.100> this<00:01:47.580> B<00:01:48.420> flat<00:01:49.220> fifth

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:02.220 

a<00:01:54.450> little<00:01:55.450> transition<00:01:56.080> to<00:01:56.230> e-flat<00:01:56.680> a<00:02:01.230> little

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:02.230 
a little transition to e-flat a little

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:14.310 
a little transition to e-flat a little
transition<00:02:02.590> to<00:02:02.830> the<00:02:02.950> b-flat<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:13.540> it<00:02:13.990> gets<00:02:14.170> me

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
transition to the b-flat and it gets me

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.470 
transition to the b-flat and it gets me
right<00:02:14.650> back<00:02:14.890> to<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.190> downbeat<00:02:15.730> just

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
right back to the downbeat just

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.650 
right back to the downbeat just
something<00:02:16.930> to<00:02:17.110> kind<00:02:17.470> of<00:02:17.560> walk<00:02:17.980> me<00:02:18.430> through<00:02:18.910> to

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
something to kind of walk me through to

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.440 
something to kind of walk me through to
the<00:02:19.690> next<00:02:20.070> downbeat<00:02:21.070> so<00:02:21.730> roots<00:02:22.060> and<00:02:22.270> fifths

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
the next downbeat so roots and fifths

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.840 
the next downbeat so roots and fifths
are<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:22.930> most<00:02:23.230> important<00:02:23.740> thing<00:02:24.040> but<00:02:24.820> a

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
are the most important thing but a

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.330 
are the most important thing but a
couple<00:02:25.240> little<00:02:25.330> notes<00:02:25.630> in<00:02:25.810> transition<00:02:26.590> to

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
couple little notes in transition to

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.120 
couple little notes in transition to
