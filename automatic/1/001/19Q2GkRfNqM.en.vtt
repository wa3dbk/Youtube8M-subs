00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
and there's really very little

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.000

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
it just sort of said what we were all

kind of what we do and so we thought it

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.490

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
would be good for comedy tab most of the

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.310 
would be good for comedy tab most of the
companies<00:02:43.310> that<00:02:43.580> we<00:02:43.850> deal<00:02:44.060> with<00:02:44.330> in<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:45.050> video

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
companies that we deal with in the video

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.460 
companies that we deal with in the video
space<00:02:45.650> is<00:02:46.070> quite<00:02:46.460> a<00:02:46.490> bit<00:02:46.760> of<00:02:46.880> them<00:02:47.540> using<00:02:47.900> TV

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
space is quite a bit of them using TV

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.530 
space is quite a bit of them using TV
today<00:02:48.680> and<00:02:49.070> I<00:02:49.670> think<00:02:49.940> the<00:02:50.060> dot<00:02:50.270> TV<00:02:50.980> really

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
today and I think the dot TV really

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.230 
today and I think the dot TV really
speaks<00:02:53.540> to<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:54.590> fact<00:02:54.830> that<00:02:55.070> it<00:02:55.430> is<00:02:55.610> a<00:02:55.640> video

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
speaks to the fact that it is a video

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.840 
speaks to the fact that it is a video
television<00:02:57.050> application<00:02:57.860> when<00:02:58.490> I<00:02:58.520> think

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
television application when I think

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.970 
television application when I think
about<00:02:58.940> TV<00:02:59.720> I<00:02:59.750> think<00:03:00.050> about<00:03:00.230> three<00:03:00.500> things<00:03:00.740> I

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
about TV I think about three things I

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.710 
about TV I think about three things I
think<00:03:01.040> about<00:03:01.430> video<00:03:01.880> I<00:03:02.210> think<00:03:02.510> about

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
think about video I think about

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.030 
think about video I think about
entertainment<00:03:03.200> and<00:03:03.560> I<00:03:03.620> think<00:03:03.830> about

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
entertainment and I think about

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.860 
entertainment and I think about
differentiation<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:05.330> three<00:03:05.540> words<00:03:05.720> that

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
differentiation the three words that

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.230 
differentiation the three words that
come<00:03:06.050> to<00:03:06.110> my<00:03:06.380> mind<00:03:06.410> are<00:03:06.980> high<00:03:07.610> quality<00:03:08.230> video
