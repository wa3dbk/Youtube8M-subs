00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.750
 for example there are cells that resist 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.700

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:16.860

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:20.630

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.630

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.049

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.180

 I'm without a signal 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.000

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.520

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.800
 I'm sure assured but how 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.560
 and so 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.870
 but if this one is complete 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.830

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:01.880
