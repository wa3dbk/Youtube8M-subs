 on winter when we were riding snowmobiles 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.640
 Yaroslavl in the names on the river was scour 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.619
 then I had an idea not to drive 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.330
 Does how much at that time I was not 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.119
 ready and the snowmobile was not ready for 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.800
 to overcome the scour and was born 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.739
 idea of ​​summer all sockets all translate 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.870
 life lesson 1 don't put buoyancy here 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:43.290
 and here the variator if water gets it and 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:45.180
 slip stall housing 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.760
 glue tape and in fact skis 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.270
 small tuning and snowmobile ready for 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.000
 the start 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.000
 first warm-up check through code 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.620
 trial yes there is industry risk happened but 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.490
 the most interesting thing is not income yet 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.920
 must overcome 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.500
 a wolf and just one drop is enough 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.450
 CVT so he drowned the most 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.790
 curious among them and our film crew 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.310
 the group stopped waiting for the yacht 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:22.350
 of the left bank of the Volga and here with the burning 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.350
 headlights rushed not finish 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.810
 and cross back over the Volga too 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.970
 succeeded but at the entrance to the water area of frames 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.010
 for the car suddenly disappeared from view 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.350
 the drive belt and snowmobile broke off 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.720
 instantly went under the water, I managed it 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.760
 drown out I took off the camera that is it lies 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.280

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.440
 piss very deeply attached to it 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.390
 rope we will get it now 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.400
 calm dry everything will be fine but i 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.610
 I think that we are far gone to this Statement 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:03.190
 though the trick was a success and repeat it to others 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.750

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.750
