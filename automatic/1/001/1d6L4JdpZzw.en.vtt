00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
let's see they got the regular pattern I

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:57.410 
let's see they got the regular pattern I
got<00:03:49.580> a<00:03:49.610> pin<00:03:49.940> so<00:03:50.720> they<00:03:50.810> can<00:03:50.990> put<00:03:51.110> in<00:03:51.200> a<00:03:51.260> pin

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:06.440 

see<00:03:57.870> how<00:03:57.959> that<00:03:58.110> works

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.070 

I<00:04:06.540> guess<00:04:07.230> that's<00:04:07.470> very<00:04:07.739> cool<00:04:07.920> on<00:04:08.810> see<00:04:09.810> they

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
I guess that's very cool on see they

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.170 
I guess that's very cool on see they
have<00:04:10.170> another<00:04:10.470> one<00:04:12.890> that<00:04:13.890> password<00:04:14.640> we<00:04:14.970> could

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
have another one that password we could

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.900 
have another one that password we could
just<00:04:15.330> put<00:04:15.569> anything<00:04:15.810> you<00:04:15.959> want<00:04:16.079> basically
