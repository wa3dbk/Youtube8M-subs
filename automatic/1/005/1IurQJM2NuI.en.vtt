max then lock frame rate off you want
port<00:01:10.080> rate<00:01:10.350> as<00:01:10.470> well<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:11.189> can<00:01:11.369> then<00:01:11.490> flip<00:01:11.820> it

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
port rate as well you can then flip it

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.719 
port rate as well you can then flip it
in<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.540> video<00:01:13.049> editor<00:01:13.290> afterwards<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.580> always

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
in a video editor afterwards so I always

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.700 
in a video editor afterwards so I always
have<00:01:14.909> portrait<00:01:15.360> because<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.810> has<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.560> less

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
have portrait because that has the less

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.950 
have portrait because that has the less
lag<00:01:16.890> then<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.640> use<00:01:17.909> my<00:01:18.090> microphone<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.869> record

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
lag then I use my microphone to record

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.280 
lag then I use my microphone to record
sound<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.130> have<00:01:20.280> aged<00:01:20.640> point<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.299> 64<00:01:21.930> which

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
sound so I have aged point to 64 which

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.280 
sound so I have aged point to 64 which
saves<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.770> dot<00:01:22.979> move<00:01:23.280> her<00:01:23.909> MOV<00:01:24.420> file<00:01:24.750> then<00:01:25.259> the

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
saves the dot move her MOV file then the

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.990 
saves the dot move her MOV file then the
video<00:01:25.650> quality<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:26.040> low<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.490> OpenGL

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
video quality is low and the OpenGL

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.969 
video quality is low and the OpenGL
capture<00:01:27.330> has<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.540> be<00:01:27.630> on<00:01:27.750> then<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.650> can<00:01:28.799> have

ipod<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.579> save<00:01:53.850> on<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.540> little<00:01:55.140> lag<00:01:55.590> in<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.399> look

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
ipod to save on a little lag in a look

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.219 
ipod to save on a little lag in a look
at<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.729> settings<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.360> i<00:01:57.420> used<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.960> play

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
at the settings that i used to play

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.139 
at the settings that i used to play
minecraft<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.070> for<00:01:59.250> Minecraft<00:01:59.640> videos<00:01:59.880> so

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
minecraft and for Minecraft videos so

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.359 
minecraft and for Minecraft videos so
let's<00:02:00.450> just<00:02:00.570> go<00:02:00.630> into<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.020> settings<00:02:01.340> so<00:02:02.340> I

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
let's just go into the settings so I

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.300 
let's just go into the settings so I
always<00:02:02.820> have<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.240> lower<00:02:03.390> graphics<00:02:03.780> quality

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
always have the lower graphics quality

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.859 
always have the lower graphics quality
setting<00:02:05.310> on<00:02:05.430> when<00:02:05.880> i'm<00:02:06.000> recording<00:02:06.119> Skyblock

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
setting on when i'm recording Skyblock

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.529 
setting on when i'm recording Skyblock
because<00:02:07.829> that<00:02:08.099> saves<00:02:08.429> on<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.640> lot<00:02:08.910> of<00:02:09.090> lag<00:02:09.209> as<00:02:09.420> it

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
because that saves on a lot of lag as it

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.150 
because that saves on a lot of lag as it
turns<00:02:09.750> down<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:09.929> render<00:02:10.289> distance<00:02:10.410> so<00:02:11.129> I

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
turns down the render distance so I

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.589 
turns down the render distance so I
definitely<00:02:11.550> suggest<00:02:11.879> that<00:02:12.180> if<00:02:12.360> you're<00:02:12.450> going

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
definitely suggest that if you're going

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.520 
definitely suggest that if you're going
to<00:02:12.660> do<00:02:12.840> if<00:02:13.110> you

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
to do if you

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.020 
to do if you
pod<00:02:13.740> legs<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:14.160> lot<00:02:14.280> when<00:02:14.490> you're<00:02:14.670> recording

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
pod legs a lot when you're recording

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.000 
pod legs a lot when you're recording
minecraft<00:02:15.540> I'd<00:02:15.900> never<00:02:16.200> ever<00:02:16.560> turn

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
minecraft I'd never ever turn

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.400 
minecraft I'd never ever turn
fantagraphics<00:02:17.700> on<00:02:17.880> but<00:02:18.600> sometimes<00:02:19.050> I<00:02:19.230> think

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
fantagraphics on but sometimes I think

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.230 
fantagraphics on but sometimes I think
recording<00:02:20.250> with<00:02:20.400> normal<00:02:20.670> graphics<00:02:20.970> is<00:02:21.060> fine

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
recording with normal graphics is fine

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.080 
recording with normal graphics is fine
so<00:02:21.900> let's<00:02:22.140> just<00:02:22.380> keep<00:02:22.530> that<00:02:22.680> on<00:02:22.830> and<00:02:23.090> then

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
so let's just keep that on and then

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.350 
so let's just keep that on and then
let's<00:02:24.330> just<00:02:24.510> eggs<00:02:24.720> out<00:02:24.870> this

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.510 

just<00:02:28.600> saved<00:02:28.870> what<00:02:29.290> I<00:02:29.470> am<00:02:29.770> what<00:02:30.250> I<00:02:30.280> just

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
just saved what I am what I just

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.490 
just saved what I am what I just
recorded<00:02:30.760> so<00:02:31.420> we're<00:02:31.570> going<00:02:31.660> to<00:02:31.780> drop<00:02:31.930> box<00:02:32.170> and

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
recorded so we're going to drop box and

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.920 
recorded so we're going to drop box and
it<00:02:33.280> will<00:02:33.460> appear<00:02:33.760> here<00:02:34.240> as<00:02:34.360> you<00:02:34.600> can<00:02:34.630> see<00:02:34.720> is<00:02:34.810> a

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
it will appear here as you can see is a

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.140 
it will appear here as you can see is a
20<00:02:35.170> megabytes<00:02:35.410> so<00:02:36.220> then<00:02:36.430> after<00:02:36.670> that<00:02:36.940> you<00:02:37.060> can

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
20 megabytes so then after that you can

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.700 
20 megabytes so then after that you can
click<00:02:37.270> it<00:02:37.390> you<00:02:37.600> can<00:02:37.720> click<00:02:37.750> upload<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.380> youtube
