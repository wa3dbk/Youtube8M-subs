after<00:00:03.179> 9/11<00:00:03.780> there<00:00:04.200> was<00:00:04.380> all<00:00:04.680> this<00:00:04.799> anxiety

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
after 9/11 there was all this anxiety

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.290 
after 9/11 there was all this anxiety
about<00:00:05.460> glass<00:00:05.940> towers<00:00:06.450> for<00:00:06.899> obvious<00:00:07.440> reasons

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:08.300 
about glass towers for obvious reasons

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.509 
about glass towers for obvious reasons
at<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.480> same<00:00:09.660> time<00:00:09.870> there<00:00:10.170> was<00:00:10.260> this

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:10.519 
at the same time there was this

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:13.430 
at the same time there was this
extraordinary<00:00:11.519> desire<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.660> build<00:00:13.170> them

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
extraordinary desire to build them

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.279 
extraordinary desire to build them
higher<00:00:13.679> than<00:00:13.980> before<00:00:14.400> I<00:00:14.670> mean<00:00:14.820> this<00:00:15.289> Imperial

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
higher than before I mean this Imperial

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.050 
higher than before I mean this Imperial
Drive<00:00:16.699> to<00:00:17.699> have<00:00:17.910> these<00:00:18.180> towers<00:00:19.050> these<00:00:19.320> spires

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
Drive to have these towers these spires

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.000 
Drive to have these towers these spires
again<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.359> there<00:00:21.570> there<00:00:21.869> was<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.020> desire<00:00:22.980> to

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
again and there there was a desire to

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.589 
again and there there was a desire to
reclaim<00:00:24.289> the<00:00:25.289> old<00:00:25.320> utopian<00:00:26.220> force<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:27.090> glass

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
reclaim the old utopian force of glass

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.320 
reclaim the old utopian force of glass
structures<00:00:28.529> in<00:00:29.189> many<00:00:29.340> ways<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.730> shard<00:00:30.000> looks

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
structures in many ways the shard looks

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.560 
structures in many ways the shard looks
like<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:31.040> project<00:00:32.040> Fryman<00:00:32.579> from<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.000> 911

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
like a project Fryman from the 911

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.780 
like a project Fryman from the 911
competition<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.469> just<00:00:34.680> grew<00:00:35.489> frustrated

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
competition that just grew frustrated

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.540 
competition that just grew frustrated
with<00:00:36.300> delays<00:00:36.660> on<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:36.989> Hudson<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.739> moved<00:00:38.430> to

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
with delays on the Hudson and moved to

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.139 
with delays on the Hudson and moved to
the<00:00:38.670> Thames<00:00:38.960> I'm<00:00:39.960> quite<00:00:40.760> ambivalent<00:00:41.760> about

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
the Thames I'm quite ambivalent about

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.020 
the Thames I'm quite ambivalent about
this<00:00:42.450> question<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.170> building<00:00:43.620> as<00:00:44.030> image

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
this question of the building as image

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.660 
this question of the building as image
on<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.870> one<00:00:46.020> hand<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.649> think<00:00:47.309> we<00:00:47.430> need

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
on the one hand I think we need

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.910 
on the one hand I think we need
architecture<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:49.340> orient<00:00:50.340> urban<00:00:51.329> life<00:00:51.539> and

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
architecture to orient urban life and

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.430 
architecture to orient urban life and
there<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.010> an<00:00:53.190> important<00:00:54.230> aspect<00:00:55.230> of

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
there is an important aspect of

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.529 
there is an important aspect of
architecture<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.760> monumental<00:00:57.449> or

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
architecture that that is monumental or

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.830 
architecture that that is monumental or
can<00:00:57.780> be<00:00:57.960> monumental<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:58.859> mean<00:00:59.430> too<00:00:59.640> often<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.420> in

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
can be monumental I mean too often in in

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.560 
can be monumental I mean too often in in
cities<00:01:01.350> people<00:01:02.160> are<00:01:02.250> lost<00:01:02.850> they<00:01:03.149> don't<00:01:03.329> have

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
cities people are lost they don't have

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.130 
cities people are lost they don't have
the<00:01:04.070> traditional<00:01:05.070> symbols<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.689> guide<00:01:06.869> them

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
the traditional symbols to to guide them

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.100 
the traditional symbols to to guide them
so<00:01:08.040> actually<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.760> know<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.479> shard<00:01:09.780> can

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
so actually you know that the shard can

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.310 
so actually you know that the shard can
be<00:01:10.229> seen<00:01:10.470> as<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:11.390> 1-point<00:01:12.390> maybe<00:01:12.780> with<00:01:13.200> the

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
be seen as a 1-point maybe with the

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.539 
be seen as a 1-point maybe with the
Garrick<00:01:13.590> on<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.860> other<00:01:13.979> side<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.430> other

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
Garrick on the other side and other

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.219 
Garrick on the other side and other
towers<00:01:15.000> in<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.299> city<00:01:15.950> too<00:01:17.060> to<00:01:18.060> orient<00:01:18.540> this

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
towers in the city too to orient this

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.800 
towers in the city too to orient this
part<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.590> London<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.600> it<00:01:21.600> might<00:01:21.780> even

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
part of London and it might even

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.560 
part of London and it might even
recapture<00:01:22.590> an<00:01:22.680> old<00:01:22.830> sense<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.640> river<00:01:24.240> as<00:01:24.540> a

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
recapture an old sense of the river as a

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.859 
recapture an old sense of the river as a
as<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.500> gateway<00:01:26.119> into<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.330> city<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.720> into

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
as a gateway into the city and into

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.969 
as a gateway into the city and into
London<00:01:28.350> proper<00:01:28.950> as<00:01:29.549> we<00:01:29.759> walk<00:01:30.420> around<00:01:30.600> it

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
London proper as we walk around it

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.469 
London proper as we walk around it
it's<00:01:32.520> disruption<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.570> scale<00:01:34.040> of<00:01:35.150> the<00:01:36.150> the

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
it's disruption to the scale of the the

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.530 
it's disruption to the scale of the the
neighborhood<00:01:36.960> is<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:38.579> severe<00:01:39.060> maybe<00:01:39.329> even

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
neighborhood is it severe maybe even

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.510 
neighborhood is it severe maybe even
catastrophic<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.409> just<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.770> juxtaposition

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
catastrophic and just the juxtaposition

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.340 
catastrophic and just the juxtaposition
of<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.759> shard<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.420> borough<00:01:42.630> market<00:01:43.200> and

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
of the shard and the borough market and

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.160 
of the shard and the borough market and
what<00:01:43.500> would<00:01:44.280> drew<00:01:45.240> people<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.710> area<00:01:48.170> that

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
what would drew people to that area that

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.359 
what would drew people to that area that
might<00:01:49.320> be<00:01:49.409> disrupted

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
might be disrupted

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.359 
might be disrupted
by<00:01:51.670> the<00:01:51.729> the<00:01:52.119> sheer<00:01:52.329> scale<00:01:52.659> of<00:01:52.869> the<00:01:52.960> thing<00:01:53.369> from

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
by the the sheer scale of the thing from

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.920 
by the the sheer scale of the thing from
the<00:01:54.630> moment<00:01:55.630> of<00:01:56.520> say<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:57.670> World<00:01:58.180> Trade<00:01:58.450> Towers

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
the moment of say the World Trade Towers

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.160 
the moment of say the World Trade Towers
in<00:01:59.530> New<00:01:59.979> York<00:02:00.399> that<00:02:01.180> was<00:02:01.270> always<00:02:01.479> a<00:02:01.600> concern

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
in New York that was always a concern

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.020 
in New York that was always a concern
that<00:02:02.710> the<00:02:03.369> you<00:02:03.430> know<00:02:03.490> the<00:02:03.610> demands<00:02:04.420> of<00:02:06.030> you

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
that the you know the demands of you

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.719 
that the you know the demands of you
know<00:02:07.149> of<00:02:07.270> advanced<00:02:07.630> capital<00:02:08.229> would<00:02:09.190> create

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
know of advanced capital would create

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.930 
know of advanced capital would create
this<00:02:09.910> disruption<00:02:10.450> in<00:02:10.720> the<00:02:10.899> city<00:02:11.260> yeah<00:02:11.769> but<00:02:12.760> the

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
this disruption in the city yeah but the

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.160 
this disruption in the city yeah but the
need<00:02:13.180> for<00:02:13.470> these<00:02:14.470> kinds<00:02:14.860> of<00:02:14.950> structures<00:02:15.519> to

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
need for these kinds of structures to

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.360 
need for these kinds of structures to
house<00:02:17.170> these<00:02:17.590> extraordinary<00:02:18.030> corporations

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
house these extraordinary corporations

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.660 
house these extraordinary corporations
that<00:02:21.690> that<00:02:22.690> loss<00:02:22.930> of<00:02:23.170> scale<00:02:23.560> would<00:02:23.860> be<00:02:23.920> fatal

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
that that loss of scale would be fatal

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.970 
that that loss of scale would be fatal
to<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.299> to<00:02:25.600> the<00:02:25.720> city<00:02:25.930> in<00:02:26.049> many<00:02:26.170> ways<00:02:26.410> it<00:02:26.680> was

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
to the to the city in many ways it was

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.970 
to the to the city in many ways it was
but<00:02:27.370> we've<00:02:27.489> also<00:02:28.060> learned<00:02:28.239> how<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:28.980> to

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
but we've also learned how to to

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.180 
but we've also learned how to to
moderate<00:02:30.760> that<00:02:31.030> scale<00:02:31.360> to<00:02:31.600> fill<00:02:32.410> in<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.860> scale

these extraordinary mega structures but
what<00:02:40.090> I<00:02:40.120> don't<00:02:40.780> see<00:02:40.870> here<00:02:41.410> yet<00:02:41.680> is<00:02:42.190> that

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
what I don't see here yet is that

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.839 
what I don't see here yet is that
mediation<00:02:43.090> is<00:02:43.360> that<00:02:43.540> connection<00:02:44.400> between<00:02:45.400> the

worked obviously that kind of
transparency<00:03:25.750> is<00:03:25.870> not<00:03:26.139> what<00:03:26.380> this<00:03:26.530> kind<00:03:26.739> of

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799

transparency<00:03:27.430> is<00:03:27.670> about<00:03:28.060> I<00:03:28.389> mean<00:03:28.840> it<00:03:28.930> really

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
transparency is about I mean it really

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
the new kind of financial world but that

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.250 
the new kind of financial world but that
you<00:03:38.829> know<00:03:39.010> again<00:03:39.549> I<00:03:39.819> think<00:03:40.389> it's<00:03:40.690> it's<00:03:41.019> too

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
you know again I think it's it's too

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.379 
you know again I think it's it's too
easy<00:03:41.290> just<00:03:41.769> to<00:03:41.980> condemn<00:03:42.459> it<00:03:42.489> I<00:03:42.819> mean<00:03:43.120> that<00:03:43.239> is

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
easy just to condemn it I mean that is

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:46.650 
easy just to condemn it I mean that is
our<00:03:43.540> situation<00:03:44.400> we<00:03:45.400> can<00:03:45.579> say<00:03:46.150> it's<00:03:46.329> nothing

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
our situation we can say it's nothing

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.930 
our situation we can say it's nothing
but<00:03:46.840> it's<00:03:47.200> been<00:03:47.410> inspected<00:03:48.250> spectacle

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
but it's been inspected spectacle

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.520 
but it's been inspected spectacle
architecture<00:03:49.810> it's<00:03:50.739> nothing<00:03:51.100> but

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
architecture it's nothing but

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.350 
architecture it's nothing but
and<00:03:52.770> the<00:03:53.480> financial<00:03:54.480> rule<00:03:54.990> of<00:03:55.110> the<00:03:55.230> world<00:03:56.360> but

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
and the financial rule of the world but

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.000 
and the financial rule of the world but
the<00:03:57.450> way<00:03:57.570> that<00:03:57.720> is<00:03:57.870> our<00:03:58.020> condition<00:03:58.500> and<00:03:58.740> the

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
the way that is our condition and the

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.680 
the way that is our condition and the
question<00:03:59.340> is<00:03:59.460> what<00:03:59.640> does<00:03:59.760> it<00:03:59.940> what<00:04:00.360> does<00:04:00.420> it

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
question is what does it what does it

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.470 
question is what does it what does it
the<00:04:00.900> building<00:04:01.110> do<00:04:01.500> with<00:04:01.770> it<00:04:01.950> I<00:04:02.160> mean<00:04:02.670> even<00:04:03.390> the

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
the building do with it I mean even the

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.950 
the building do with it I mean even the
term<00:04:03.780> I<00:04:04.080> don't<00:04:04.110> know<00:04:04.350> who<00:04:05.220> coined<00:04:05.550> it<00:04:05.820> but<00:04:06.210> even

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:06.960 
term I don't know who coined it but even

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.610 
term I don't know who coined it but even
the<00:04:07.080> term<00:04:07.320> suggests<00:04:07.920> that<00:04:08.250> it<00:04:08.370> is<00:04:08.400> this<00:04:09.290> act<00:04:10.290> of

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
the term suggests that it is this act of

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.140 
the term suggests that it is this act of
violence<00:04:10.860> to<00:04:12.050> thrust<00:04:13.050> this<00:04:13.670> piece<00:04:14.670> of<00:04:14.940> glass

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
violence to thrust this piece of glass

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.090 
violence to thrust this piece of glass
and<00:04:15.300> steel<00:04:17.060> right<00:04:18.060> into<00:04:18.450> the<00:04:18.829> heart<00:04:19.829> of<00:04:19.950> the

and steel right into the heart of the
city<00:04:20.310> and<00:04:20.640> maybe<00:04:21.239> it's<00:04:21.450> a<00:04:21.510> way<00:04:21.660> to<00:04:22.400> to<00:04:23.400> pump<00:04:23.700> it

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.140 
city and maybe it's a way to to pump it
back<00:04:24.030> up<00:04:24.300> you<00:04:24.570> know<00:04:24.690> -<00:04:24.780> it's<00:04:25.440> like<00:04:25.790> extreme<00:04:26.790> and

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
back up you know - it's like extreme and

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.240 
back up you know - it's like extreme and
extreme<00:04:27.530> operation<00:04:28.530> you<00:04:28.650> know<00:04:28.740> radical

heart to get it to go again and that's
that<00:04:37.200> seems<00:04:37.350> to<00:04:37.500> be<00:04:37.590> the<00:04:37.710> metaphor<00:04:38.130> that<00:04:38.480> it

that seems to be the metaphor that it
