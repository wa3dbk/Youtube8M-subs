00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.170 

so<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:11.280> sounds<00:01:11.640> pretty<00:01:11.850> good

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
so it sounds pretty good

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.850 
so it sounds pretty good
you<00:01:12.360> hear<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:13.940> tubes<00:01:15.650> working<00:01:16.650> really

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
you hear the the tubes working really

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.450 
you hear the the tubes working really
hard

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
hard

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.969 
hard
it<00:01:17.640> has<00:01:18.420> percussion<00:01:19.230> on<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.500> even<00:01:21.740> which<00:01:22.740> is

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
it has percussion on it even which is

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.010 
it has percussion on it even which is
you<00:01:23.490> can<00:01:23.700> program<00:01:24.120> it<00:01:24.540> make<00:01:24.810> some

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
you can program it make some

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.990 
you can program it make some
modifications<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.830> make<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.250> exactly<00:01:26.820> the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
modifications to make it exactly the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.780 
modifications to make it exactly the
same<00:01:27.030> as<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.510> B<00:01:27.630> 3<00:01:27.870> it<00:01:28.200> has<00:01:28.740> fold<00:01:29.430> back

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
same as the B 3 it has fold back

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.750 
same as the B 3 it has fold back
actually<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.229> sound<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.830> actually<00:01:32.070> B<00:01:32.460> 3

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
actually so the sound is actually B 3

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.510 
actually so the sound is actually B 3
some<00:01:33.090> say<00:01:33.300> this<00:01:33.510> one<00:01:33.720> sounds<00:01:34.140> better<00:01:34.200> than<00:01:34.800> a

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
some say this one sounds better than a

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.210 
some say this one sounds better than a
couple<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.300> B<00:01:36.450> 3<00:01:36.690> they<00:01:37.050> know<00:01:37.229> so<00:01:37.619> that's<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.100> good

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
couple of B 3 they know so that's a good

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.540
