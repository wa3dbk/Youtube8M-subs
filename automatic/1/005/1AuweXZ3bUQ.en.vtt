sources<00:00:22.230> from<00:00:22.380> EA<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.980> think<00:00:23.220> it's<00:00:23.340> fake<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.730> it

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
sources from EA I think it's fake and it

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.269 
sources from EA I think it's fake and it
looks<00:00:24.359> fake<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.630> be<00:00:24.900> fair<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.439> high<00:00:25.619> quality

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
looks fake to be fair the high quality

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.640 
looks fake to be fair the high quality
images<00:00:26.789> there<00:00:27.359> are<00:00:27.510> no<00:00:27.660> high<00:00:27.840> quality<00:00:28.260> images

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
images there are no high quality images

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.009 
images there are no high quality images
they're<00:00:28.949> bad<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.760> EA<00:00:29.939> wouldn't<00:00:30.359> use<00:00:30.510> low<00:00:30.779> res

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
they're bad the EA wouldn't use low res

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.749 
they're bad the EA wouldn't use low res
images<00:00:31.500> for<00:00:31.769> league<00:00:31.949> sources<00:00:32.250> like<00:00:32.520> that

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759
