00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.759
 hello to you all again yandex and 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.450
 today I would like to talk about the pros and 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.540
 minus ground 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:17.340
 what are the good hammers so that when 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:19.350
 some earlier you can here and when 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.769
 will be in the region st this they will 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:27.449
 set fire to this hammer and we are very 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:30.300
 a lot of health minus very big 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:34.520
 ground it when you ask for hammers then 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:39.079
 you can put out smog so be 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:42.690
 careful if you ask for hammers 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:47.250
 somewhere you want to quit could he 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.649
 about 3 will immediately explode 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.550
 contact with fire that is you 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.860
 throwing 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:59.129
 and when the smog hit the hammer here it is 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.379
 the husband could then immediately open and so 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.470
 the most you can put out so be 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:08.220
 be careful not to sign your chance 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:11.130
 hammers and you can stop those 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.340
 By the very calculation you can hammers and 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.680
 Six seconds later, you can already count 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.630
 I could wipe since 67 seconds lit 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.540
 hammers now in order to throw 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.009
 could and now he could solve 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.720
 you will be able to stop the enemy on 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.700
 full 20 seconds and i wo n't stand 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.720
 for example 2 from the top temke and we already 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.009
 let's say for them that they are mines there 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.860
 ground is what you can 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.110
 promote your opponents from your 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.799
 allies also you can fallen 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.619
 set yourself on fire and throw the wrong 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:50.369
 place at the right time so be 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:54.570
 neat with these items as he 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.310
 very dangerous for our allies but 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.700
