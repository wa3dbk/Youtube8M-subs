00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.739
 doom is not doom

 such a moment a desperate day I am in the morning 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.729

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:08.110
 I really liked the wise man and I 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.110
 I realized right away that we have some kind of connection 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.300
 and on the project I met Lena 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.310
 Elena Golovan she reached the top 6 before 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.110
 semi-finals and there on the project together and 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.140
 met there began our story 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.730
 and she's straight during the project together 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.750
 together with the project developed our 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.790
 the story is from the city of Lubny, Poltava 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.920
 area but lives in Kiev, all as you are waiting 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.660
 the fact that I say yes all I'm leaving in 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.550

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.840
 is counting on a residence permit because 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.060
 that I cannot predict and 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.600
 plan that I put my roots in 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.670
 Ukraine 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.030

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.510

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.910

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.010

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.390

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.430
