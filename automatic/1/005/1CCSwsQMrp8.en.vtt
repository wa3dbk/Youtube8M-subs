00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
and I mean I kind of expected as much as

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.429 
and I mean I kind of expected as much as
type<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.299> series<00:01:06.570> would<00:01:06.689> have<00:01:06.900> something<00:01:07.140> like

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
type of series would have something like

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.230 
type of series would have something like
that<00:01:07.650> because<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.369> kind<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.909> harem

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
that because it is kind of a harem

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.210 
that because it is kind of a harem
series<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.619> would<00:01:10.770> have<00:01:10.890> some<00:01:11.130> of

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
series and so it would have some of

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.320 
series and so it would have some of
these<00:01:11.310> core<00:01:11.580> themes<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.119> would<00:01:12.210> see

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
these core themes that you would see

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.520 
these core themes that you would see
from<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.600> hare<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:12.840> when<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.049> comes<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.380> like

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
from a hare and when it comes to like

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.770 
from a hare and when it comes to like
small<00:01:13.890> episodes<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.640> stuff<00:01:14.820> like<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.270> so

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
small episodes and stuff like that so

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.840 
small episodes and stuff like that so
it's<00:01:16.020> nothing<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.500> really<00:01:16.770> be<00:01:16.950> like<00:01:17.340> shocked
