00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hey people welcome to one 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.700
 new video on the game with multichannel 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.140
 people we just could not be 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.389
 let and again new 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.599
 smart dough worried and this time 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:16.139
 especially ferro magnetic well 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.640
 and we are here at the can 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.680
 already so funny bumps 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.150
 What that means , I think so 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.090
 now a supermagnet in it 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.670
 that is why the note neodymium magnets 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.939
 are no toys suitable from 14 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.779
 years was so kneading only from 14 is 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.910
 or 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.820
 what is still in here I am very 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.800
 looking forward to who here bph free completely 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.070
 classic and again the note too 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.539
 Achievable splitter was jumping and is 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.129
 stretchable here at the back again 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.680
 really visualizes very cool 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.940
 of course, if we knead it with it 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.430
 of course and I would say 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.079
 we are going to open our box right away 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:01.079
 I am very curious and can see there 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:04.500
 something sticks already here 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.229
 or sticks to the magnet 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.729
 this is our little supermagnet here 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.260
 Let's take a look at the one we put 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.240
 cool and ours on this 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.909
 ferromagnetic putty there I am now 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.049
 I really do not look forward to seeing them 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:27.030
 it feels like it starts 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:29.670
 no different than the other products 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.200
 which we are camp from this series 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.850
 In any case, a little bit the 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.210
 Surface is a bit softer yet 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:40.770
 It's also very hard to shape and shape 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.869
 we see it glittering a bit 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.549
 the company magnetic dough that exists 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.450
 also in different color variations yet 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:51.270
 Here are the black really 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.549
 a little bit cool and cool 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.040
 Of course I would like to test if 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.899
 which is often reachable for example yes 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.729
 no problem so no 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.500
 special feature over others the 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.810
 Of course, special features are somewhere else 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.790
 and that the ferro is magnetic 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.630
 and we want to do that right now 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.849
 test 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:15.459
 because we all want to think so 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:19.599
 Let's try our smaller one 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:22.060
 supermagnet here our blog our 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:25.690
 he dice very small 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:30.459
 in contrast to this but great 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:33.780
 magnetically clear our play do the same 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.780
 Let's try it here, too 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.700
 maybe if we invite her here 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.450
 a little bit of songs the knead apparently 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:51.730
 maybe a bit recharge too 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:54.959
 not na that does not work so but 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.069
 okay, okay 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:01.420
 Of course we want the kneading now 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:04.269
 continue testing and we will do it for you 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.459
 the times a bit thinner to look 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:10.150
 how it works so relate 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:13.989
 our kneading is so natural 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:17.920
 Let's see how it works here 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:20.549
 we'll do that here 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.549
 even thinner 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:28.410
 So little weight for our little one 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.410
 mountain 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.270
 so really cool ours 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:21.200
 I like ferromagnetic putty 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:23.350
 really can really very well 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:27.440
 use our blog here ours 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.250
 supermagnet cube and do what we do 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:33.050
 want 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.160
 the plasticine stays on the magnet we can 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.970
 get everywhere 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:45.680
 here is her first time if she is her 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:47.150
 goes through so almost was so one 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.010
 supermagnet and also the companies 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:53.060
 magnetic dough really super cool 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:57.170
 For example, we would like to go through that too 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:05:01.280
 Test if our missing magnetic 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:03.560
 Knock bot that was loud also jumps yes 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.040
 you should not go directly to the magnet 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.140
 down 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:10.490
 ok jumps on any need 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:16.070
 we had already torn that apart 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:17.210
 super shown the belly and also again 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:22.720
 the smell test I have all 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:24.770
 yes, also relatively neutral 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.050
 even here you do not get any 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.000
 headache but as I said with the 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.660
 magnets here is really careful 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.760
 necessary 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:40.100
 that really is super strong really 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:42.520
 very very much no problem here 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:45.800
 to take the here 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:48.260
 no thing at all that's natural 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:52.670
 very good can also here 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:54.470
 reinstopfen rausholen more I think 

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:57.650
 very very good the fourth magnetic 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:59.780
 knead new smart play and our 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:04.310
 market our supermagnet the war here 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:06.590
 I think a great product again 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:10.490
 I have so much fun with it 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.870
 really recommend it to you 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.340
 with the great blog here that does 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.840
 really fun with it you can really 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:22.860
 do the most different things 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:22.860
 really pulling our magnets behind 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:29.380
 really very cool so the ferro 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:31.500
 magnetic kneading smart kneading 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:34.320
 I really like it very much 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:37.570
 really makes this fun especially here 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.000
 really came with our magnet 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:41.410
 have a lot of fun 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.520
 I hope you had fun I will 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:44.860
 Now think a little bit further 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:47.520
 have fun and I'd seen say 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.520
 us next time
