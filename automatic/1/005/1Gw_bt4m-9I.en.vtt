00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.270 
or shades of green like so then just go
to<00:02:37.760> filters<00:02:39.220> now<00:02:40.220> go<00:02:40.670> to<00:02:41.300> render<00:02:42.070> you're<00:02:43.070> going

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
to filters now go to render you're going

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.160 
to filters now go to render you're going
to<00:02:44.260> show<00:02:45.260> me<00:02:45.290> that<00:02:46.360> so<00:02:47.360> you<00:02:47.420> go<00:02:47.600> to<00:02:47.660> filters

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
to show me that so you go to filters

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.390 
to show me that so you go to filters
then<00:02:48.830> go<00:02:48.980> to<00:02:49.040> render<00:02:49.480> then<00:02:50.480> go<00:02:50.690> to<00:02:50.750> nature<00:02:51.400> then

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
then go to render then go to nature then

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.730 
then go to render then go to nature then
go<00:02:52.550> to<00:02:52.610> flame<00:02:52.910> like<00:02:53.840> so<00:02:54.100> so<00:02:55.100> the<00:02:55.280> flame<00:02:56.740> window

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
go to flame like so so the flame window

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.420 
go to flame like so so the flame window
will<00:02:57.920> pop<00:02:58.160> up<00:02:58.840> so<00:02:59.840> we<00:02:59.990> can<00:03:00.200> change

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
will pop up so we can change

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.170 
will pop up so we can change
your<00:03:03.150> view<00:03:03.540> by<00:03:04.319> zooming<00:03:04.560> in<00:03:04.920> or<00:03:05.189> zooming<00:03:05.280> out

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
your view by zooming in or zooming out

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.899 
your view by zooming in or zooming out
like<00:03:06.780> so<00:03:07.049> can<00:03:07.500> change<00:03:07.739> the<00:03:07.920> X<00:03:08.010> offset<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.760> y

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:08.909 
like so can change the X offset the y

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:11.270 
like so can change the X offset the y
offset<00:03:09.230> or<00:03:10.230> basically<00:03:10.560> just<00:03:10.709> change<00:03:11.129> the

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
offset or basically just change the

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.179 
offset or basically just change the
pattern<00:03:11.640> so<00:03:12.629> you<00:03:13.049> have<00:03:13.500> a<00:03:13.560> variety<00:03:14.159> of

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:14.189 
pattern so you have a variety of

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:19.180 
pattern so you have a variety of
patterns<00:03:14.640> here<00:03:15.209> like<00:03:16.250> swirl

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
patterns here like swirl

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.949 
patterns here like swirl

from text button so you hit that after

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.060 
from text button so you hit that after
you<00:05:30.300> had<00:05:30.419> done<00:05:30.449> all<00:05:30.780> that<00:05:31.050> you<00:05:31.620> go<00:05:31.740> to<00:05:31.800> select

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
you had done all that you go to select

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.300 
you had done all that you go to select
and<00:05:32.820> we're<00:05:33.330> going<00:05:33.479> to<00:05:33.540> shrink<00:05:33.870> the<00:05:34.830> area<00:05:35.130> see

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
and we're going to shrink the area see

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.270 
and we're going to shrink the area see
well<00:05:35.940> we<00:05:36.240> have<00:05:36.389> selected<00:05:37.080> so<00:05:37.650> you<00:05:38.040> go<00:05:38.220> to

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
well we have selected so you go to

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.870 
well we have selected so you go to
shrink<00:05:39.260> we're<00:05:40.260> going<00:05:40.560> to<00:05:40.710> shrink<00:05:40.979> it<00:05:41.190> by<00:05:41.490> two

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
shrink we're going to shrink it by two

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.460 
shrink we're going to shrink it by two
pixels<00:05:42.360> and<00:05:43.050> it<00:05:43.500> should<00:05:43.770> look<00:05:43.919> like<00:05:43.979> this<00:05:44.280> one

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:45.470 
pixels and it should look like this one

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.890 
pixels and it should look like this one
so<00:05:46.470> after<00:05:47.160> this<00:05:47.340> I'm<00:05:47.669> just<00:05:47.880> going<00:05:48.060> to<00:05:48.240> cut<00:05:48.449> the

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
so after this I'm just going to cut the

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.189 
so after this I'm just going to cut the
selection<00:05:49.470> by<00:05:49.949> hitting<00:05:50.190> control<00:05:50.669> X<00:05:50.990> like<00:05:51.990> so

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:52.199 
selection by hitting control X like so

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:55.159 
selection by hitting control X like so
so<00:05:52.590> it's<00:05:52.620> pretty<00:05:53.040> much<00:05:53.810> transparent<00:05:54.810> now<00:05:54.930> but

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:55.169 
so it's pretty much transparent now but

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:58.780 
so it's pretty much transparent now but
we're<00:05:55.350> not<00:05:55.470> done<00:05:55.710> yet

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:58.790 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.310 

you<00:05:59.330> go<00:05:59.480> to<00:05:59.540> your<00:05:59.780> layers<00:06:00.110> window<00:06:00.640> like<00:06:01.640> so<00:06:01.850> and

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.320 
you go to your layers window like so and

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:08.230 
you go to your layers window like so and
you<00:06:03.340> create<00:06:04.340> a<00:06:04.370> new<00:06:04.610> layer<00:06:06.880> with<00:06:07.880> our<00:06:08.060> new

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 
you create a new layer with our new

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.470 
you create a new layer with our new
layer<00:06:08.510> I'm<00:06:09.140> going<00:06:09.380> to<00:06:09.530> hide<00:06:09.680> the<00:06:09.710> other<00:06:09.950> layers

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:10.480 
layer I'm going to hide the other layers

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.740 
layer I'm going to hide the other layers
we're<00:06:11.480> going<00:06:11.690> to<00:06:11.810> paste<00:06:12.110> what<00:06:12.530> we<00:06:13.310> had<00:06:13.580> cut<00:06:14.120> so

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:14.750 
we're going to paste what we had cut so

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.700 
we're going to paste what we had cut so
hit<00:06:15.020> ctrl<00:06:15.470> V<00:06:15.650> like<00:06:16.370> so<00:06:16.550> and<00:06:17.150> then<00:06:18.080> we're<00:06:18.410> going

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710 
hit ctrl V like so and then we're going

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:24.490 
hit ctrl V like so and then we're going
to<00:06:20.200> reduce<00:06:21.200> its<00:06:22.160> opacity

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:24.500 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.360 

like<00:06:25.010> so<00:06:25.250> I'm<00:06:25.730> gonna<00:06:25.940> make<00:06:26.180> it<00:06:26.330> transparent

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.370 
like so I'm gonna make it transparent

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:31.270 
like so I'm gonna make it transparent
like<00:06:28.370> that<00:06:28.810> and<00:06:29.810> then<00:06:30.350> we're<00:06:30.650> going<00:06:30.680> to<00:06:31.070> anchor

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 
like that and then we're going to anchor

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.250 
like that and then we're going to anchor
this<00:06:31.670> one<00:06:31.910> with<00:06:32.120> our<00:06:32.300> new<00:06:32.570> layer<00:06:32.810> that<00:06:33.050> we<00:06:33.230> had

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:33.260 
this one with our new layer that we had

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.880 
this one with our new layer that we had
created<00:06:33.610> by<00:06:34.610> heading<00:06:34.940> right<00:06:35.150> click<00:06:35.450> and<00:06:35.780> then

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:35.890 
created by heading right click and then

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:41.290 
created by heading right click and then
anchor<00:06:36.890> layer<00:06:37.780> like<00:06:38.780> so<00:06:39.790> so<00:06:40.790> we're<00:06:41.000> going<00:06:41.120> to

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:41.300 
anchor layer like so so we're going to

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:47.630 
anchor layer like so so we're going to
show<00:06:41.540> our<00:06:43.270> original

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:47.640 

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.200 

text<00:06:48.720> like<00:06:49.720> so<00:06:49.750> then<00:06:50.380> we<00:06:50.530> go<00:06:50.650> to<00:06:50.680> the<00:06:50.920> move<00:06:51.100> tool

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:51.210 
text like so then we go to the move tool

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.870 
text like so then we go to the move tool
to<00:06:52.210> be<00:06:52.360> able<00:06:52.510> to

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:53.880 
to be able to

that

00:06:58.909 --> 00:06:58.919 
that

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:03.920 
that
or<00:07:00.289> transparent<00:07:01.340> color<00:07:02.340> like<00:07:02.729> so<00:07:02.840> so<00:07:03.840> if

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:03.930 
or transparent color like so so if

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:07.219 
or transparent color like so so if
you're<00:07:04.080> satisfied<00:07:04.349> that<00:07:05.810> we<00:07:06.810> open<00:07:07.110> our

00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:07.229 
you're satisfied that we open our

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:10.959 
you're satisfied that we open our
background<00:07:07.710> that's<00:07:08.039> up<00:07:08.219> and<00:07:08.550> here<00:07:09.029> is<00:07:09.240> your

00:07:10.959 --> 00:07:10.969 
background that's up and here is your

00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:17.019 
background that's up and here is your
batter<00:07:11.969> so<00:07:12.960> what<00:07:13.259> I<00:07:13.439> had<00:07:13.590> done<00:07:13.860> is<00:07:14.189> basically

00:07:17.019 --> 00:07:17.029 

00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:20.869 

use<00:07:18.029> a<00:07:18.060> couple<00:07:18.509> of<00:07:18.629> layers<00:07:18.870> and<00:07:19.319> then<00:07:19.680> make<00:07:19.949> my

00:07:20.869 --> 00:07:20.879 
use a couple of layers and then make my

00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:24.350 
use a couple of layers and then make my
text<00:07:21.770> transparent<00:07:22.770> so<00:07:23.729> if<00:07:23.909> you<00:07:24.060> want<00:07:24.240> an

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:24.360 
text transparent so if you want an

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.330 
text transparent so if you want an
animated<00:07:24.870> banner<00:07:25.020> only<00:07:25.529> after<00:07:25.770> two<00:07:25.919> is<00:07:26.069> pass

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:26.340 
animated banner only after two is pass

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.760 
animated banner only after two is pass
this<00:07:26.610> to<00:07:26.789> an<00:07:26.909> animation<00:07:27.330> filter<00:07:27.900> you<00:07:28.620> could

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:28.770 
this to an animation filter you could

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:31.100 
this to an animation filter you could
also<00:07:28.889> do<00:07:29.129> some<00:07:29.340> layers<00:07:29.580> this<00:07:30.419> is<00:07:30.479> an<00:07:30.749> example

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:31.110 
also do some layers this is an example

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:34.220 
also do some layers this is an example
of<00:07:31.319> passing

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:34.230 

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:37.820 

when<00:07:34.890> animating<00:07:35.310> there<00:07:35.670> this<00:07:36.120> is<00:07:36.420> the<00:07:36.830> ripple

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:37.830 
when animating there this is the ripple

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:42.640 
when animating there this is the ripple
effect<00:07:39.710> this<00:07:40.710> one<00:07:40.980> is<00:07:41.250> the<00:07:41.670> burning<00:07:42.120> effect

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:42.650 
effect this one is the burning effect

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:47.390 
effect this one is the burning effect
and<00:07:43.790> this<00:07:44.790> one<00:07:45.060> is<00:07:45.500> basically<00:07:46.500> by<00:07:47.130> using

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:47.400 
and this one is basically by using

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.870 
and this one is basically by using
layers<00:07:48.560> so<00:07:49.560> I<00:07:49.590> hope<00:07:50.160> you<00:07:50.310> had<00:07:50.430> learned<00:07:50.670> from
