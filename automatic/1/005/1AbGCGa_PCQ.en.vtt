so<00:01:40.079> they<00:01:40.290> got<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.829> MGB<00:01:41.460> air<00:01:41.700> cleaner<00:01:42.060> which<00:01:42.810> is

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
so they got the MGB air cleaner which is

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.920 
so they got the MGB air cleaner which is
this<00:01:43.350> giant<00:01:43.890> can<00:01:44.189> here<00:01:44.700> okay<00:01:45.390> which<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.780> this

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
this giant can here okay which is this

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.719 
this giant can here okay which is this
can<00:01:46.200> here<00:01:46.909> along<00:01:47.909> with<00:01:48.710> this<00:01:49.710> piece<00:01:49.979> that<00:01:50.280> goes

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
can here along with this piece that goes

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.910 
can here along with this piece that goes
on<00:01:50.970> here<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.299> then<00:01:51.420> this<00:01:51.600> air<00:01:51.840> cleaner<00:01:51.960> bolts

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
on here and then this air cleaner bolts

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.120 
on here and then this air cleaner bolts
up<00:01:53.100> against<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.850> carburetor<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:55.020> radius<00:01:55.860> on

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
up against the carburetor that radius on

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.120 
up against the carburetor that radius on
here<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:56.759> an<00:01:57.270> essential<00:01:57.869> part<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.560> MGB

like<00:02:39.530> this<00:02:39.740> of<00:02:39.950> paper<00:02:40.190> which<00:02:40.940> if<00:02:41.150> you<00:02:41.300> took<00:02:41.810> it

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
like this of paper which if you took it

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.040 
like this of paper which if you took it
apart<00:02:42.260> would<00:02:42.530> be<00:02:42.680> about<00:02:42.890> that<00:02:43.160> tall<00:02:43.460> and<00:02:44.050> the

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
apart would be about that tall and the

it<00:02:47.120> sideways<00:02:47.300> you<00:02:47.960> know<00:02:48.080> it's<00:02:48.230> a<00:02:48.350> great<00:02:48.620> big

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
it sideways you know it's a great big

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.570 
it sideways you know it's a great big
long<00:02:49.100> piece<00:02:49.430> zigzag<00:02:50.390> which<00:02:51.140> which<00:02:51.560> allows<00:02:52.160> a

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
long piece zigzag which which allows a

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.180 
long piece zigzag which which allows a

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
lot of air volume to pass through and it

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.610 
lot of air volume to pass through and it
also<00:02:55.340> allows<00:02:56.060> a<00:02:56.390> lot<00:02:56.600> of<00:02:56.750> particulates<00:02:57.350> to<00:02:57.500> be

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
also allows a lot of particulates to be

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.699 
also allows a lot of particulates to be
drawn<00:02:57.920> out<00:02:57.950> here's<00:02:58.850> an<00:02:59.000> MGB<00:02:59.390> air<00:02:59.720> cleaner<00:03:00.080> with
