00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.760

 and yes I hope he stays with me 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.780
 received a long time and I can today really 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.160
 do not talk 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.410
 That's why I would say we catch 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.600
 Just let's start with the video like that 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.870
 start with our cake in the glass for 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.289
 the bizkit ground needs 140 grams 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.300
 flour 140 grams sugar three eggs 1 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.250
 packet of vanilla sugar a packet 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.460
 baking powder mineral water with carbonated 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.989
 and a pinch of salt 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.939
 First we separate the yolk from 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.799
 protein and giving are two different 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:12.270
 bowls then we go in the protein 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.159
 a larger bowl enter 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.020
 add tablespoons sugar and beat that 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.020
 whole with the mixer to ice snow instead 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.880
 the yolk we give another 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.780
 bowl and add sugar and sugar 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:31.979
 vanilla sugar all we stir now 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.979
 with the mixer frothy 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.950
 then we give it a bit 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.160
 add mineral water and mix that 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.160
 again 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:46.420
 we mix it with the 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.420
 Slowly blender our flour and baking powder 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.690
 when it's done, we'll see it 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.820
 very carefully the egg with the 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.410
 hand whisk under side on each 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.820
 be careful and patient if 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.350
 you stir too much then the dough 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.150
 not relaxed and of course stupid 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.310
 and now divide the dough in three 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.630
 Sharp and stain one of them too 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.630
 be really careful again 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:16.500
 we do the same with the second 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:18.330
 part in green we leave the third part 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.220
 Just as he was, I give it all 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:27.660
 Now on a big tin roof later 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:30.060
 that's how it gets 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.070
 180 degrees about 15 minutes in the oven 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.600
 this may vary depending on the oven but really 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.060
 So their party fits a bit 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.800
 on it during s creed ground in the oven 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.320
 Let's take care of the raspberry cream 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.060
 that one in the packet headline with 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.050
 a pack side rises and hits 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.050
 that with the mixer stiff 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.140
 then we go to press 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.320
 the way through a sieve so that easy 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.820
 Do not come in the sawn kernels if 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.230
 you think they have enough of what 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.180
 Incidentally, I did not have one here 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.550
 then that goes carefully under the stiff 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.620
 Whipped cream until evenly 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.480
 is distributed and then you have more 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.790
 but already finished when the dough 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.830
 ready baked is loosening am careful 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.370
 from the baking paper and then pierce circles 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.950
 out 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.990
 they should be about as big or small 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.990
 that they will fit good glasses later 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.230
 Now the fun part can only times 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.730
 we give our references in ours 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.990
 glass and then put a layer 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.850
 pure biscuit soil 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.470
 the color arrangement remains to you 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.970
 of course left to themselves 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:33.930
 the layer of soil always comes one 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:35.430
 layer down who creamed to graduation 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.840
 I have it again hints 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.070
 given and then forgives the same 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.610
 a bit in addition to a few 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.610
 sugar pearls 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.830
 so if the cake in the glass maybe 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.240
 was given away just decorate 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.770
 want then you can not tape-drum 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.360
 Wrap looks super cute in any case 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.220
 Of course, it does not have to be 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.960
 Who wonders how to eat the whole 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.640
 should just take a small spoon 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.640
 and leaking tasted mega good 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.180
 homemade chocolates are actually 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.500
 also a mega sweet present something 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.570
 is a bit more personal and it works 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.700
 also super fast as a emergency solution 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.960
 if you do not have it yourself 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.460
 It is much easier to do than if 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.780
 I may guess first 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.030
 Show yourself today four different 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.190
 you need varieties for the first variety 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.190
 a silicone mold which is from Kaufland 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.410
 white and shows with the chocolate and 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.090
 cranberries here fill up the little ones 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.230
 about a third with melted 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.820
 white chocolate 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.530
 the cheap of kaufland is suitable 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.510
 By the way, believe me so much 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.790
 The mold was now in the fridge 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.410
 until the chocolate has cooled down a bit 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.180
 then we go a little bit 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.280
 melted bittersweet chocolate in the 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.720
 then set our cranberries 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.880
 take a look that you are not the edge 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.350
 touch or stand on top of it 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.820
 Let's go how the chocolate is 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.560
 fills the form so up to two 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.730
 third ca and puts the whole then 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.710
 back in the fridge 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.030
 Last but not least for our white one 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.460
 chocolate and fill the little molds 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.050
 complete to the top with it and then 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.700
 next to this job or something else 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.890
 flat and pull the excess 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.960
 chocolate as I am here so now 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.700
 the whole thing will be really hard since 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.380
 really not too impatient for now 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.360
 we have to push them out of shape and 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.440
 it works only with a little power like you 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.510
 Actually, that was pretty good 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.280
 easy and you are already finished the 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.290
 second and third variants are now working 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.510
 right together for the second needs 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.850
 Make her a big bowl again 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:25.169
 they are now full of depot 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:27.550
 chocolate sugar whipped cream and 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:29.110
 ground almonds and for the third 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.250
 You also need a variant 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.810
 still hazelnut kernels 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.970
 We have to go for the first time now 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.710
 Variant 2 give our mandl that 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.229
 super easy and you take it first 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.940
 ground almonds sugar and a little bit 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:41.800
 whipped cream and not then together 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.510
 the exact quantities you can for you 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.979
 I like to feel it here 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.400
 I also have some almonds and even 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:48.680
 to deal with it all 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.050
 thicker and already finished cinema 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.610
 really easy for us 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.050
 chocolate filled with chocolate 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.389
 Look what the edges up to 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.650
 Well caught and then we tilt that 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:59.120
 whole out yes that seems first 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.860
 to be pretty pointless but you 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.470
 because it gets just like that here 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.210
 to fill a wonderful cavity 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.039
 off in the fridge with it and on 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.539
 It's when the chocolate has become 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:11.000
 we are now filling in half 

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:12.169
 our pallien the almond cream and in 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.910
 the other we enter first 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:15.860
 a little chocolate and then you have that 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.600
 happy about everything combis it out 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.080
 chocolate to the edge and the rest 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.080
 he already knows 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.620
 I have the finished chocolates now 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.030
 still with some white chocolate 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.530
 Decorated by those with the hazelnut 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:30.430
 cream I still have so little chocolate 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.430
 are enough done 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:36.740
 we need the last variant again 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:39.710
 a bittersweet chocolate molds white 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.389
 make chocolate and marzipan first 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.570
 we the same as variant two 

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:45.860
 and three just with bitter chocolate 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.720
 and who would have guessed it ? 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:52.310
 small marzipan balls also fits so far 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:53.449
 do not get too big then we go 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.250
 again a little bit of chocolate 

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:57.770
 in the pralines and then each one 

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.180
 a small marzipan ball pushes her 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.500
 like a little rows we should 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.330
 not stick out over the edge 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.889
 Now we find everything complete and 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.570
 remove the excess chocolate 

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:07.280
 as well as off again in the 

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:08.780
 fridge with it and when everything is ready 

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.909
 is you the pralines to lustenau 

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:13.400
 decorate I still edible 

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:14.810
 golden color powder taken yes and then 

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.099
 the chocolates are already finished 

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.419
 of course we need for the praline 

00:07:16.099 --> 00:07:19.400
 I have another box for that 

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:21.020
 an old glossybox taken for that 

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.570
 I then still some old labels from 

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:25.550
 last video on my glossybox logo 

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:27.949
 just glued a bit appropriate 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:29.570
 looks the whole because so if 

00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:32.409
 it is done and quite honestly so hard 

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:32.409
 it was not or yet 

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:43.280
 yes I hope I like the video 

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:45.410
 Link my here now 

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:48.380
 last two videos of re / max must
