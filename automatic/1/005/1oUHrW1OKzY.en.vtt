and<00:02:41.260> then<00:02:42.040> lay<00:02:43.110> that<00:02:44.110> one<00:02:44.350> half<00:02:44.650> aside<00:02:44.770> and

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
and then lay that one half aside and

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.460 
and then lay that one half aside and
then<00:02:46.090> start<00:02:46.360> working<00:02:46.630> on<00:02:46.780> this<00:02:47.110> one

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
then start working on this one

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.260 
then start working on this one
if<00:02:47.590> you<00:02:47.770> cut<00:02:47.980> your<00:02:48.100> ends<00:02:48.430> like<00:02:48.610> I've<00:02:48.760> done<00:02:48.910> just

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
now you end up with the sort of um fat

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.040 
now you end up with the sort of um fat
stubby<00:02:53.680> ends<00:02:54.460> if<00:02:54.940> you<00:02:55.090> want<00:02:55.300> your<00:02:55.450> ends<00:02:55.780> to<00:02:56.020> be

stubby ends if you want your ends to be

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.980 
stubby ends if you want your ends to be
more<00:02:56.560> like<00:02:56.770> thinning<00:02:57.130> out<00:02:57.250> into<00:02:57.610> a<00:02:57.640> point<00:02:58.240> what

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
more like thinning out into a point what

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.270 
more like thinning out into a point what
you<00:02:59.110> can<00:02:59.260> do<00:02:59.470> is<00:02:59.710> just<00:03:00.060> take<00:03:01.060> your<00:03:01.420> um<00:03:02.160> I'm<00:03:03.160> not

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
you can do is just take your um I'm not

you can do is just take your um I'm not
going<00:03:03.430> to<00:03:03.490> do<00:03:03.550> that<00:03:03.670> I'm<00:03:03.820> just<00:03:04.030> going<00:03:04.180> to<00:03:04.270> show

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
going to do that I'm just going to show

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.630 
going to do that I'm just going to show
you<00:03:04.450> so<00:03:04.810> you<00:03:04.840> can<00:03:05.140> do<00:03:05.290> then<00:03:05.410> is<00:03:05.440> just<00:03:05.590> take<00:03:06.460> this

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
you so you can do then is just take this

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.030 
you so you can do then is just take this
apart<00:03:07.630> into<00:03:07.870> two<00:03:08.170> and<00:03:08.470> then<00:03:09.240> layer<00:03:10.240> it<00:03:10.510> like

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
apart into two and then layer it like

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.320 
apart into two and then layer it like
this<00:03:12.040> so<00:03:12.370> you<00:03:12.400> have<00:03:12.610> a<00:03:12.640> little<00:03:12.820> bit<00:03:13.000> sticking

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
this so you have a little bit sticking

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.180 
this so you have a little bit sticking
out<00:03:13.540> of<00:03:13.630> the<00:03:13.750> one<00:03:13.900> half<00:03:14.110> then<00:03:14.320> it<00:03:14.440> will<00:03:14.560> become

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
out of the one half then it will become

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.630 
out of the one half then it will become
a<00:03:15.220> little<00:03:15.400> bit<00:03:15.550> pointy<00:03:15.970> but<00:03:16.210> I<00:03:16.390> don't<00:03:16.750> mind<00:03:16.990> the

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
a little bit pointy but I don't mind the

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.800 
a little bit pointy but I don't mind the
slightly<00:03:18.640> chubby<00:03:19.060> ones<00:03:19.330> I<00:03:19.480> think<00:03:19.690> they're

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
slightly chubby ones I think they're

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.110 
slightly chubby ones I think they're
quite<00:03:19.990> cute<00:03:20.260> so<00:03:20.800> here's<00:03:21.070> what<00:03:21.250> you<00:03:21.340> do<00:03:21.490> get

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.810 

let's<00:04:27.960> sound<00:04:28.229> this<00:04:28.470> quite<00:04:29.160> horrible<00:04:29.520> but<00:04:29.789> you

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
let's sound this quite horrible but you

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:59.930 
let's sound this quite horrible but you
know<00:04:30.770> that's<00:04:31.770> how<00:04:32.039> it

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.670 

if<00:05:00.940> you<00:05:01.090> really<00:05:01.360> can't<00:05:01.570> stand<00:05:01.690> the<00:05:02.050> sound<00:05:02.320> then

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
if you really can't stand the sound then

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.140 
if you really can't stand the sound then
you<00:05:02.770> can<00:05:02.889> use<00:05:03.009> a<00:05:03.039> towel<00:05:03.370> instead<00:05:03.850> of<00:05:04.030> the

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
you can use a towel instead of the

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.909 
you can use a towel instead of the
bubble<00:05:04.419> wrap<00:05:04.600> I<00:05:04.780> just<00:05:05.229> find<00:05:05.470> out<00:05:05.560> the<00:05:05.650> bubbles

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
bubble wrap I just find out the bubbles

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:07.230 
bubble wrap I just find out the bubbles
kind<00:05:06.070> of<00:05:06.160> help<00:05:06.340> because<00:05:06.639> they<00:05:06.729> work<00:05:06.880> sort<00:05:07.150> of

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
kind of help because they work sort of

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.689 
kind of help because they work sort of
like<00:05:07.389> fingers<00:05:07.780> you<00:05:08.590> can<00:05:08.860> make<00:05:09.190> the<00:05:09.310> rovings

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:09.699 
like fingers you can make the rovings

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:13.800 
like fingers you can make the rovings
going<00:05:10.360> like<00:05:10.509> this<00:05:11.370> too<00:05:12.370> but<00:05:12.610> I<00:05:13.389> don't<00:05:13.479> know<00:05:13.630> I

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
going like this too but I don't know I

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.400 
going like this too but I don't know I
think<00:05:14.470> this<00:05:14.710> is<00:05:14.770> better<00:05:16.020> so<00:05:17.020> you'll<00:05:17.169> need<00:05:17.289> to

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
think this is better so you'll need to

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.180 
think this is better so you'll need to
keep<00:05:17.560> rolling<00:05:19.020> for<00:05:20.020> maybe<00:05:20.229> five<00:05:20.530> minutes<00:05:20.740> per

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
keep rolling for maybe five minutes per

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:26.450 
keep rolling for maybe five minutes per
bread<00:05:21.430> otherwise<00:05:22.389> they're<00:05:22.630> gonna<00:05:22.720> open<00:05:22.900> up

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.279 

and<00:05:27.460> remember<00:05:27.910> yeah<00:05:28.090> this<00:05:28.330> looks<00:05:28.539> thin<00:05:28.900> now

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:29.289 
and remember yeah this looks thin now

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:31.080 
and remember yeah this looks thin now
but<00:05:29.740> it's<00:05:29.860> gonna<00:05:30.039> swell<00:05:30.340> up<00:05:30.370> a<00:05:30.639> little<00:05:30.789> bit

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
but it's gonna swell up a little bit

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.010 
but it's gonna swell up a little bit
once<00:05:31.330> it<00:05:31.510> dries<00:05:33.270> if<00:05:34.270> you're<00:05:34.479> tugging<00:05:34.720> your

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
once it dries if you're tugging your

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.659 
once it dries if you're tugging your
dreads<00:05:35.260> a<00:05:35.350> little<00:05:35.560> bit<00:05:35.740> and<00:05:35.949> it<00:05:36.130> still<00:05:36.340> opens

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:36.669 
dreads a little bit and it still opens

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:38.070 
dreads a little bit and it still opens
up<00:05:36.849> that<00:05:37.180> means<00:05:37.360> you<00:05:37.449> have<00:05:37.570> to<00:05:37.660> keep<00:05:37.840> rolling

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
up that means you have to keep rolling

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.350 
up that means you have to keep rolling
but<00:05:38.590> if<00:05:38.740> it<00:05:38.860> doesn't<00:05:39.160> open<00:05:39.190> up<00:05:39.460> then<00:05:39.910> you<00:05:40.120> are

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
but if it doesn't open up then you are

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:46.740 
but if it doesn't open up then you are
good<00:05:40.840> to<00:05:40.870> put<00:05:41.169> this<00:05:41.289> aside<00:05:44.160> and<00:05:45.449> if<00:05:46.449> you<00:05:46.570> can

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
good to put this aside and if you can

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.189 
good to put this aside and if you can
keep<00:05:46.960> the<00:05:47.289> dread<00:05:47.530> hanging<00:05:47.889> over<00:05:48.550> right<00:05:48.930> to<00:05:49.930> dry

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:50.199
