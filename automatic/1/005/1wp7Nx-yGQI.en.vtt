00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.270
 video tutorial I come to show you how 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.970
 download the drivers of our pc without 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.309
 internet connection this we can 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.070
 do from another pc or simply from 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.929
 a good cybercafe the first thing we go 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.109
 to do is to enter the page that 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.970
 I will leave in the description of the video 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:23.160
 once inside the page we give in the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.570
 option to start the detection and after 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.570
 that just follow my steps 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:38.290
 I know there is here from here 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.290

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.949
 on topics 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.400
 well here we are going to choose the option that 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.440
 is coupled to the operating system of the pc 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.270
 to which we are going to download the drivers 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.270
 in my case it is 32 bits 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.409
 Once the plugin is downloaded, it will 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.540
 an executable excel file 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.470
 we were click to open and follow my steps 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.470
 for the installation 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.060
 the blanket 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.060

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:55.149
 here yes 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.799
 you have to put 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.420
 once the plugin is installed on the ct that 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.850

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.870
 start button we look for the folder where 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.870
 is our plugin 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.970
 we open the folder and then in 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.160
 preferences 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.900

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.320
