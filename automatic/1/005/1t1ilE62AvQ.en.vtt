00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.660 
so if you were learning the piece puts a
go<00:02:29.000> now<00:02:30.140> if<00:02:31.140> actually<00:02:31.890> let<00:02:32.010> me<00:02:32.070> just<00:02:32.100> go<00:02:32.340> just

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
go now if actually let me just go just

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.090 
go now if actually let me just go just
let<00:02:32.790> me<00:02:32.850> to<00:02:32.970> show<00:02:33.000> you<00:02:33.210> this<00:02:33.300> again<00:02:33.540> if<00:02:34.170> you

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
let me to show you this again if you

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.340 
let me to show you this again if you
stop<00:02:35.370> this<00:02:35.550> while<00:02:35.790> you're<00:02:36.030> in<00:02:36.180> this<00:02:36.360> screen

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.130 

you<00:02:40.350> can<00:02:41.360> think<00:02:42.360> it<00:02:42.480> was<00:02:42.570> a<00:02:42.600> way<00:02:42.780> I<00:02:42.840> did<00:02:43.050> it

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
you can think it was a way I did it

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:55.580 
you can think it was a way I did it
earlier<00:02:53.690> there's<00:02:54.690> a<00:02:54.810> way<00:02:54.930> you<00:02:54.960> can<00:02:55.110> stop<00:02:55.560> it

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
earlier there's a way you can stop it

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.830 
earlier there's a way you can stop it
and<00:02:55.890> it<00:02:56.130> all<00:02:56.280> you<00:02:56.760> can<00:02:56.970> just<00:02:57.180> tap<00:02:57.360> it<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:57.660> it'll

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
and it all you can just tap it and it'll

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.360 
and it all you can just tap it and it'll
play<00:02:57.960> the<00:02:58.170> next<00:02:58.290> nodes<00:02:58.590> along<00:02:58.710> so<00:02:58.950> you<00:02:58.980> can<00:02:59.190> see

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
play the next nodes along so you can see

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.090 
play the next nodes along so you can see
exactly<00:02:59.520> what<00:02:59.910> you're<00:03:00.030> doing<00:03:00.150> okay<00:03:01.140> so<00:03:01.500> if<00:03:01.980> we

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
exactly what you're doing okay so if we

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:23.900 
exactly what you're doing okay so if we
go<00:03:02.250> back<00:03:02.460> to<00:03:02.490> nan<00:03:02.940> listen<00:03:03.360> to<00:03:03.450> this<00:03:03.540> one<00:03:22.910> okay

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
go back to nan listen to this one okay

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.000 
go back to nan listen to this one okay
so<00:03:24.300> if<00:03:24.660> we<00:03:24.780> switch<00:03:25.110> this<00:03:25.380> little<00:03:25.710> switch<00:03:25.860> on

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
so if we switch this little switch on

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.559 
so if we switch this little switch on
here<00:03:26.190> which<00:03:26.310> looks<00:03:26.400> like<00:03:26.550> a<00:03:26.640> storm<00:03:27.000> cloud

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
here which looks like a storm cloud

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.839 
here which looks like a storm cloud
the<00:03:29.319> rain<00:03:29.620> and<00:03:29.650> thunder<00:03:30.220> which<00:03:30.340> gives<00:03:30.549> a<00:03:30.670> nice

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
the rain and thunder which gives a nice

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:37.720 
the rain and thunder which gives a nice
ambience

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.309
