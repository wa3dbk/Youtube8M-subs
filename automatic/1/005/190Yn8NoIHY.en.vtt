00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:09.799
 whiskey dot de meeting point fine spirits 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.419
 Welcome to whiskey store 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:13.370
 meeting point full of spirits and I have 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:15.620
 a new appearance brought in the 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.620
 year 2014 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.990
 namely the building morning gold called 43 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:26.600
 minute percent 1 liter bottle yes the 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:29.930
 probably comes from the travel value me 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:33.379
 Think as if these bottles are now in the bottle 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.750
 The value as ancestral with 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:39.650
 would replace the age information and 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:42.230
 as if Baumann also suffer from it 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:45.380
 it does not start to be that old 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.660
 Matured with bottles we give more 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.640
 fortunately, they have a relief 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.100
 at the 25-year-old now sees it 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.700
 regularly there but now there are probably 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:01:00.530
 problems on the other side because of this 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:02.899
 Now probably others bottle from the travel 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.619
 value is already in small patch 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:10.369
 come out without age now 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:17.780
 So this gold reef gold reef is one 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:18.350
 golden deer and this reef lies now 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.069
 in front 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.959
 bowmore directly at the still in and explain 

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:26.990
 there and under the underwater world must 

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:31.299
 be very rich and also diver 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:34.819
 against this, look at this reef 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:37.340
 and that starts to shine golden 

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:44.229
 if the sun is right yes and me 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:44.229
 older fracks and can be found down there 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:55.130
 then what is in this gold reef in it 

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:59.569
 fine areas sherry barrels of 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:04.249
 North America and Europe are helping 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:08.360
 to form the final character of this 

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:10.950
 complex single malts of the name 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:16.790
 also reflects the rich golden 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:21.470
 but the barkas characteristic family 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:27.780
 coconut milk baked 40 oranges 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:32.580
 lime smoke pineapple juice the limit 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:35.760
 kiwifrÃ¼chte lake salt lake place and 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:41.030
 olive oil that has never heard 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:47.700
 that's going to be interesting honey now though 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:56.730
 dry Steve Nash shipwreck 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:03:01.700
 content already in a different way closer 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.700
 stand on it yourself and there he is 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:18.850
 sad as it should not be so 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:25.870
 but sadly overflowing 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:31.360
 sad the bottles are not quite 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:33.550
 Good is a liter in it 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.460
 but if you look at it with the liter of 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.420
 a surf compares no 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.790
 comparison 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.580
 the price is almost twice as high 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.700
 here is something at drilling price 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:50.140
 done what a higher 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:52.510
 spread speaks but whether the fetters 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:56.700
 I am better at these high ones 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.700
 Price justifies seeing it soon 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.490
 more clearly also connected with if he 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.490
 nothing else first time 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.030
 now fruit is coming through 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.800
 the whole story becomes sweet 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:43.910
 fairy tales as lemons for yourself 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:47.620
 the coconut milk I'm sorry for remains 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.620
 locked behind the smoke for me 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.060
 maybe later 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.190
 first with then more intense now again 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:20.310
 mild 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:22.830
 yes the pineapple mango kiwi sour times 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:28.050
 exotic fruits that can be papa 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:34.010
 or a pomegranate or something like that 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:38.240
 after the olive oil leaving is one 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:38.240
 strange note 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.610
 that could be called olive oil 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.900
 interpret 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.900
 but you can also mark it 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:53.820
 interesting is a long departure with the 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:56.600
 know 40 kite yes the possibility 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.600
 really do not deny 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:03.440
 and now that you get used to a smoke 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.440
 has the full fruit behind 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:17.060
 All I can not find the coconut 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:20.259
 I do not think so now , too 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:29.919
 entire fruit after and now leaves the 

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:29.919
 smoke and a bit of the field 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:37.580
 interesting whiskey leaving the spawning season 

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:41.449
 Please note from the European mainland 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:44.080
 I guess quite different than me 

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:46.400
 I'm used to bowmore 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.409
 The other bonus is one 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.719
 more pronounced cherry influence 

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:53.509
 less so the distillery's influence 

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:55.819
 this clear fruitiness, too 

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:57.349
 normal did not forbid exuberantly 

00:06:55.819 --> 00:07:04.190
 but not too weak so grad 

00:06:57.349 --> 00:07:09.050
 Right in the middle of it, the price is worth it, I know 

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:11.509
 Not the last ball I have 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.440
 tried too long ago but the same 

00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:15.889
 I'll try one more 

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:18.800
 there it was then a shopsystem after 

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:20.050
 what's there and I'm happy with 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.110
 turn it on again 

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.110
 Many Thanks
