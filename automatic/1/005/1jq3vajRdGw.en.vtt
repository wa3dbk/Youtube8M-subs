00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
flash of light to kill the moment so try

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.420

shooting<00:02:14.480> without<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:15.080> flash<00:02:15.310> when<00:02:16.310> you're

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
shooting without the flash when you're

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.460 
shooting without the flash when you're
