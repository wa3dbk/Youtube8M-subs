00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 what happens to you flow what's wrong with you 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.569
 I know why he always puts on this helmet and 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.090
 when I go in the first person because 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.759
 they see weird things maybe the best thing is 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.469
 helmet necessarily so you do not have 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.549
 embarrassment at the end of the race 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.790
 show your face because they make you a 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.790
 raccoon 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:40.270
 also as civil water truth 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:40.270
 and obviously it takes them out of the way 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.489
 if your brain 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.239
 you can not imagine inside inside because 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.470
 He knows that I made the race but because 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.970
 other points that had points to spend 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.530
 with your uncle today is global this is a 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.940
 both complicated slow and with their gods 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.900
 why because why why why 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.010
 why have you been for example 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.080
 salmon chile 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.519
 welcome because there is a point there but 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.110
 I thought it was the point that was not 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.759
 because it was the point of later because the 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.070
 point went with the point of the point 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:09.710
 the score did not and it was what it was not 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.020
 effectively and this is all the fault of the 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.890
 point is all the fault of the cloud subtracts 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.890
 we take money 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.740
 when you reach the next point no no no no 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.740
 do not 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:32.750
 about to fall 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:49.260
 here the 67 I would stay and put you a 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:51.390
 peanut introduction on the wrist for 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.080
 for what happens to me that came 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.630
 beatings I'm getting the kid 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.570
 but where is the eagle becomes more 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:03.040
 strong is that in my mother the eagle that 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.040
 it is written and serious 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:11.720
 I'm super away, I'm really at 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.550
 click to run more first 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.890
 super super saver person also 2 in 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.300
 plants and make them mouth wow but what 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.300
 I do jumping over a bus 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.760
 she was very strong flowers take from the 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.190
 First person I'm not good at 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.459
 every time I have no points left for 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.459
 decide 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.830
 the first person is one thing is super 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:42.940
 beautiful and super easy, it's really so 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:42.940
 Easy as it is easy 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.310
 I always earn what happens when I 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.200
 have you had the opportunity to save me 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.970
 I'm going to win you whenever you win 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.950
 it was just laughing at me without knowing what it is 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.690
 which creates that theory is not for nothing 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.930
 valid lad to the and more impossible here 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.370
 I think a lot more besides perfect 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.730
 I like that 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.050
 but it would be a pity if I caught you 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.930
 having the lic 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:17.300
 it's a pity that on your screen you can 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.230
 that can not be true pronounced and wins 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.230
 and win 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.349
 reality are always above 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.160
 those of pacheta or have done it in this 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:30.110
 career 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.670
 the first races when you bought 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.500
 a new game in anything is everything 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.730

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.069
 danny let's keep playing this fire over 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.660
 one year is already true but no account is 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.040
 obvious that the defeats told us that 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.810
 they gave us the game year before but without 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.950
 tell anybody uncle listen to age and you 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.299
 you see in pedaling the theory as if 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.709
 you had to jump but wait all 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:47.060
 video pedaled milk always know me 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.510
 will serve as the change of subject not 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.510
 radically 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:04:03.430
 one year before 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.390

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.930
 flow thousand until it jumped over 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.540
