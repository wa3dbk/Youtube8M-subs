00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.550 

I<00:00:00.060> think<00:00:00.420> he<00:00:00.539> targeted<00:00:01.020> that<00:00:01.079> medic<00:00:01.350> cuz<00:00:01.469> he

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:01.560 
I think he targeted that medic cuz he

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:02.780 
I think he targeted that medic cuz he
had<00:00:01.650> to<00:00:01.740> go<00:00:01.829> past<00:00:02.070> a<00:00:02.220> couple<00:00:02.310> Marines<00:00:02.639> and

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
had to go past a couple Marines and

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:03.919 
had to go past a couple Marines and
definitely<00:00:03.060> was<00:00:03.179> not<00:00:03.240> a<00:00:03.330> hold<00:00:03.540> position

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
definitely was not a hold position

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:05.390 
definitely was not a hold position
attack<00:00:04.170> it<00:00:04.350> was<00:00:04.470> looked<00:00:04.740> like<00:00:04.799> a<00:00:04.890> targeted

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
attack it was looked like a targeted

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.450 
attack it was looked like a targeted
attack<00:00:06.680> hydras<00:00:07.680> done<00:00:07.859> is<00:00:07.980> now<00:00:08.099> up<00:00:08.250> so<00:00:08.370> he's

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
attack hydras done is now up so he's

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.650 
attack hydras done is now up so he's
going<00:00:08.550> to<00:00:08.610> have<00:00:08.760> lurkers<00:00:09.090> pretty<00:00:09.330> soon<00:00:09.510> and

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
going to have lurkers pretty soon and

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.690 
going to have lurkers pretty soon and
flash<00:00:10.110> does<00:00:10.440> not<00:00:10.620> have<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:11.070> Marines<00:00:11.309> to<00:00:11.519> move

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
flash does not have the Marines to move

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.970 
flash does not have the Marines to move
out<00:00:11.849> right<00:00:11.880> now<00:00:12.269> normally<00:00:13.110> at<00:00:13.230> this<00:00:13.500> point<00:00:13.830> the

out right now normally at this point the
turn<00:00:14.700> is<00:00:14.790> going<00:00:14.910> to<00:00:14.969> want<00:00:15.089> to<00:00:15.150> have<00:00:15.269> have

turn is going to want to have have

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.330 
turn is going to want to have have
enough<00:00:16.049> of<00:00:16.170> an<00:00:16.260> army<00:00:16.590> built<00:00:16.770> up<00:00:16.949> that<00:00:17.070> they<00:00:17.190> can

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
enough of an army built up that they can

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.620 
enough of an army built up that they can
start<00:00:17.580> pushing<00:00:18.000> out<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.300> it<00:00:18.390> looks<00:00:18.570> like

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
start pushing out and it looks like

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.599 
start pushing out and it looks like
flashes<00:00:19.080> kind<00:00:19.560> of<00:00:19.650> toying<00:00:19.920> with<00:00:20.160> that<00:00:20.310> idea

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
flashes kind of toying with that idea

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.970 
flashes kind of toying with that idea
trying<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.570> move<00:00:21.689> down<00:00:21.810> that<00:00:22.050> ramp<00:00:22.260> now<00:00:22.859> I'm

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
trying to move down that ramp now I'm

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:23.900 
trying to move down that ramp now I'm
waiting<00:00:23.100> for<00:00:23.250> another<00:00:23.609> round<00:00:23.789> of

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
waiting for another round of

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.849 
waiting for another round of
reinforcements<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.570> he's<00:00:24.689> just<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:25.230> stem<00:00:25.740> is

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
reinforcements and he's just a stem is

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.189 
reinforcements and he's just a stem is
obviously<00:00:26.160> upgrade<00:00:26.460> now<00:00:26.689> he's<00:00:27.689> pushing<00:00:28.080> out<00:00:28.170> a

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
obviously upgrade now he's pushing out a

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.779 
obviously upgrade now he's pushing out a
little<00:00:28.349> bit<00:00:28.470> here<00:00:28.619> now<00:00:28.769> but<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.310> don't<00:00:29.580> know<00:00:29.699> if

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
little bit here now but I don't know if

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.120 
little bit here now but I don't know if
he<00:00:29.910> has<00:00:30.119> enough<00:00:30.810> forces<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.380> actually<00:00:31.800> put<00:00:31.980> any

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
he has enough forces to actually put any

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.889 
he has enough forces to actually put any
pressure<00:00:32.309> on<00:00:32.579> he<00:00:32.820> he's<00:00:33.149> hoping<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.570> try<00:00:33.780> and

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
pressure on he he's hoping to try and

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.870 
pressure on he he's hoping to try and
get<00:00:33.989> zero<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.890> at<00:00:35.010> least<00:00:35.160> spend<00:00:35.460> some<00:00:35.640> money<00:00:35.790> on

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
get zero to at least spend some money on

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.180 
get zero to at least spend some money on
on<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.480> sunken<00:00:37.350> colonies<00:00:37.710> or<00:00:37.860> something<00:00:38.100> like

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
on the sunken colonies or something like

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.490 
on the sunken colonies or something like
that<00:00:38.250> but<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.520> think<00:00:38.610> 0<00:00:39.120> with<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.690> squad<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.170> muta

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
that but I think 0 with a squad of muta

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.780 
that but I think 0 with a squad of muta
seized<00:00:40.680> up<00:00:40.829> plus<00:00:41.070> 1<00:00:41.309> armor<00:00:41.640> which<00:00:41.760> is

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
seized up plus 1 armor which is

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.090 
seized up plus 1 armor which is
beautiful<00:00:42.629> which<00:00:42.780> works<00:00:42.989> really<00:00:43.200> just<00:00:43.680> really

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
beautiful which works really just really

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.540 
beautiful which works really just really
nicely<00:00:44.309> against<00:00:46.070> against<00:00:47.070> medic<00:00:47.340> rains

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
nicely against against medic rains

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.830 
nicely against against medic rains
especially<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.180> med<00:00:48.329> greens<00:00:48.570> aren't

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
especially the med greens aren't

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.569 
especially the med greens aren't
upgraded<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.620> make<00:00:49.770> all<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.160> difference<00:00:50.250> in

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
upgraded to make all the difference in

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.389 
upgraded to make all the difference in
the<00:00:50.610> world<00:00:50.760> I'd<00:00:51.690> haven't<00:00:52.020> seen<00:00:52.140> if<00:00:52.260> flash<00:00:53.160> does

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
the world I'd haven't seen if flash does

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.740 
the world I'd haven't seen if flash does
have<00:00:53.579> any<00:00:53.730> upgrades<00:00:54.090> on<00:00:54.180> his<00:00:54.300> Marines<00:00:54.539> there

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
have any upgrades on his Marines there

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.889 
have any upgrades on his Marines there
and<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:56.010> he<00:00:56.399> with<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.850> group<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.210> links<00:00:57.510> going<00:00:57.690> as

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
and so he with a group of links going as

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.270 
and so he with a group of links going as
well<00:00:58.020> he<00:00:58.230> could<00:00:58.379> theoretically<00:00:58.680> take<00:00:59.100> out

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
well he could theoretically take out

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.500 
well he could theoretically take out
this<00:00:59.399> group<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.730> mech<00:00:59.850> rains<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.239> then<00:01:00.359> being

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
this group of mech rains and then being

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.479 
this group of mech rains and then being
a<00:01:00.629> huge<00:01:01.079> huge<00:01:01.469> huge<00:01:01.649> lead<00:01:01.980> he's<00:01:02.190> got<00:01:02.370> his

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
a huge huge huge lead he's got his

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.119 
a huge huge huge lead he's got his
fourth<00:01:03.329> base<00:01:03.600> going<00:01:03.899> up<00:01:04.110> now<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:04.710> if<00:01:04.799> he<00:01:05.010> can

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
fourth base going up now so if he can

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.760 
fourth base going up now so if he can
stop<00:01:05.430> this<00:01:05.700> pressure<00:01:06.030> push<00:01:06.360> here<00:01:06.770> pressure

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
stop this pressure push here pressure

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.410 
stop this pressure push here pressure
push<00:01:08.070> then<00:01:08.549> he's<00:01:08.729> going<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:08.939> be<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.090> really

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
push then he's going to be a really

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.789 
push then he's going to be a really
really<00:01:09.540> good<00:01:09.720> shape<00:01:09.900> we've<00:01:10.080> got<00:01:10.229> hydras<00:01:10.650> out

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
really good shape we've got hydras out

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.100 
really good shape we've got hydras out
which<00:01:10.979> means<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.310> lurkers<00:01:11.670> are<00:01:12.150> almost<00:01:12.840> done

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
which means the lurkers are almost done

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.499

of a hit four or five medics in the mix
now<00:01:27.960> though<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.320> that's<00:01:28.860> not<00:01:28.979> much<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.189> an

could if he radiates a couple of those
guys<00:06:57.720> take<00:06:58.720> out<00:06:58.870> that<00:06:59.020> group<00:06:59.199> of<00:06:59.349> lurkers<00:06:59.530> with

00:07:00.059 --> 00:07:00.069 
guys take out that group of lurkers with

00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:02.100 
guys take out that group of lurkers with
those<00:07:00.280> marines<00:07:00.580> but<00:07:01.360> then<00:07:01.659> again<00:07:01.780> he<00:07:01.960> does

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:02.110 
those marines but then again he does

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:03.480 
those marines but then again he does
have<00:07:02.289> a<00:07:02.319> high<00:07:02.620> ground<00:07:02.919> which<00:07:03.069> is<00:07:03.190> really<00:07:03.370> good

have a high ground which is really good

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.999 
have a high ground which is really good
and<00:07:03.699> now<00:07:04.090> this<00:07:04.330> the<00:07:04.840> Defiler<00:07:05.259> have<00:07:05.590> consumed

and now this the Defiler have consumed

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:07.439 
and now this the Defiler have consumed
already<00:07:06.310> it's<00:07:06.699> going<00:07:06.849> to<00:07:06.879> try<00:07:07.060> and<00:07:07.090> go<00:07:07.270> on<00:07:07.360> from

already it's going to try and go on from

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:09.600 
already it's going to try and go on from
the<00:07:07.569> low<00:07:07.780> ground<00:07:08.020> actually<00:07:08.800> Destructo

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:09.610 
the low ground actually Destructo

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:10.740 
the low ground actually Destructo
alongside<00:07:09.759> he's<00:07:10.120> probably<00:07:10.300> going<00:07:10.479> to<00:07:10.569> go<00:07:10.629> in

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:10.750

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:13.950 
from the top as well as what I'm
thinking<00:07:12.190> but<00:07:12.879> he<00:07:12.940> won't<00:07:13.210> need<00:07:13.419> you<00:07:13.539> to<00:07:13.659> swarm
