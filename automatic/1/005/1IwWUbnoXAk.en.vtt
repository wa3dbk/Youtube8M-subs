00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.779
 in the range of new British rods 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.850
 for the next season we have three 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:35.120
 different versions 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:39.590
 we have the elite team sides match 2 and the 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:43.239
 new t mesh of infinites the elite is one 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:48.320
 rod intended for fish fishing 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:51.080
 in any case not excessive in Italy because it is 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.530
 action mainly of tip to one 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:57.110
 extremely thin peak of its own 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.110
 because it is suitable for launching floats 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:03.409
 however not exaggerated we say the 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:06.470
 maximum of 14 16 grams and for fishing 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:08.690
 also with finals and hooks very small is 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.060
 a rod that finds its maximum 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.860
 expression in brawn fishing 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.049
 precisely because lips is a fish that has 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.200
 a very delicate vocal apparatus and 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:20.510
 needs a rod with an action of 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.290
 tip and above all with the peak 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:26.810
 very thin this kind of English 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:30.470
 available in two different sizes 420 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:33.920
 450 and in three different versions as 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.800
 power the tim x2 is an action barrel 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.400
 more parabolic a rod that already has one 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.020
 summit a little more rigid and suitable for 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.930
 even throwing floats too 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.850
 higher and 20 grams a cane 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:51.870
 an extremely precise rod that 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.730
 finds the highest expression in peaches 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.650
 what exactly does it mean when 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.400
 we have to throw floats 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.050
 exactly 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.090
 near for example the opposite bank 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.440
 where where there are also reeds e 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.460
 we must be very precise 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.880
 this is the ideal can and 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:13.740
 it is a cane that is presented in three 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:17.970
 different sizes 420 450 480 and in five 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:20.370
 different powers as last born we have 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.580
 the ac infiniti team is a rod 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.190
 as can already be seen from the name it has 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.800
 an infinite throwing power a rod 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.540
 which to which 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.540
 it can still be hooked up 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.460
 floating also of 30 40 50 grams e 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:39.560
 it can also be used for fishing 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:40.970
 with bombards or trout and one 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.480
 cane that has a peak 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:47.630
 extremely rigid and powerful and comes 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.930
 used for long point launch 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:54.440
 distances and however with wires we say 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:57.530
 however quite resistant at least 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.860
 in the order of 0 12 0 14 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.860
 and as a handle this is infinite 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:07.330
 as you can see in a handle in 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.700
 neoprene precisely to guarantee the 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:14.390
 best possible grip given precisely 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:17.060
 this is the remarkable launching power 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.350
 so that we can guarantee the maximum 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.180
 safety 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.430
 and unlike the two rods instead 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.940
 precedents that have as handle is 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:29.930
 the classic cork that guarantees a 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:33.650
 better a better grip a better one 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.660
 the best tool control sides 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:40.420
 infinite match is produced in two 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:44.530
 different sizes 450 480 and in three different sizes 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.530
 versions as power 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.470
 ok
