good<00:02:30.010> thing<00:02:30.250> we're<00:02:30.430> using<00:02:31.080> red<00:02:32.080> if<00:02:32.440> you're

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
good thing we're using red if you're

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.309 
good thing we're using red if you're
using<00:02:32.860> yellow<00:02:33.220> look<00:02:34.180> on<00:02:34.360> which<00:02:34.540> it<00:02:34.720> sticks<00:02:35.140> out

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
using yellow look on which it sticks out

00:02:35.319 --> 00:03:08.059 
using yellow look on which it sticks out
I<00:02:35.940> mean<00:02:36.940> it<00:02:37.060> does<00:02:37.390> stick<00:02:37.660> out<00:02:37.810> but<00:02:38.200> not<00:02:38.530> as<00:02:38.709> much

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.039 

sticky<00:03:09.069> piston<00:03:09.610> I<00:03:09.700> think<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:10.239> sticky<00:03:10.630> piston

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
sticky piston I think the sticky piston

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.240 
sticky piston I think the sticky piston
is<00:03:11.230> you<00:03:11.410> only<00:03:12.400> thing<00:03:12.840> it<00:03:13.840> might<00:03:14.440> be<00:03:14.709> the<00:03:14.950> only

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
is you only thing it might be the only

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:41.840 
is you only thing it might be the only
sticky<00:03:15.970> piston<00:03:16.359> you<00:03:16.510> need<00:03:16.720> for<00:03:16.989> mousetrap

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.370 

okay<00:03:42.850> so<00:03:42.910> I'm<00:03:43.150> gonna<00:03:43.269> build<00:03:43.510> this<00:03:43.600> dr.<00:03:43.930> set<00:03:44.109> for

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
okay so I'm gonna build this dr. set for

00:03:44.380 --> 00:04:12.060 
okay so I'm gonna build this dr. set for
three<00:03:45.310> and<00:03:45.940> go<00:03:46.180> out<00:03:46.359> one

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.560 

make<00:04:13.070> sure<00:04:13.310> this<00:04:13.550> is<00:04:13.790> not<00:04:14.030> touching<00:04:14.450> we'll

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
make sure this is not touching we'll

00:04:14.570 --> 00:05:04.330 
make sure this is not touching we'll
stop<00:04:14.810> them<00:04:15.050> otherwise

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.070 

what<00:05:05.340> was<00:05:05.610> right<00:05:05.910> just<00:05:06.290> piston<00:05:08.630> will<00:05:09.630> actually

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
what was right just piston will actually

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:57.320 
what was right just piston will actually
stop<00:05:10.470> something<00:05:55.580> if<00:05:56.580> you<00:05:56.880> want<00:05:57.120> to<00:05:57.210> mess

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
stop something if you want to mess

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.600 
stop something if you want to mess
around<00:05:57.510> with<00:05:57.900> it<00:05:58.110> make<00:05:58.620> it<00:05:58.650> to<00:05:59.160> where<00:05:59.280> it

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
around with it make it to where it

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:19.409 
around with it make it to where it
doesn't<00:05:59.820> go<00:06:00.030> out<00:06:00.210> repeatedly<00:06:00.900> you<00:06:01.230> can

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:19.419 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:22.540 

they're<00:06:20.419> honest<00:06:20.870> it<00:06:21.080> if<00:06:21.289> you<00:06:21.439> have<00:06:21.620> any<00:06:22.219> other

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:22.550 
they're honest it if you have any other

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:33.580 
they're honest it if you have any other
ideas<00:06:29.560> on<00:06:30.560> how<00:06:31.280> I<00:06:31.310> can<00:06:31.520> prove<00:06:32.180> this<00:06:32.590> because

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.590 
ideas on how I can prove this because

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.379 
ideas on how I can prove this because
I'm<00:06:33.949> just<00:06:34.159> working<00:06:34.520> on<00:06:34.610> the<00:06:34.729> top<00:06:34.939> of<00:06:35.030> my<00:06:35.120> head

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:35.389 
I'm just working on the top of my head

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:39.850 
I'm just working on the top of my head
really<00:06:36.259> I'm<00:06:36.469> just<00:06:36.530> looking<00:06:37.099> at<00:06:37.250> the<00:06:37.370> video<00:06:38.860> and

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:39.860 
really I'm just looking at the video and

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.879 
really I'm just looking at the video and
the<00:06:40.550> real<00:06:40.729> mouse<00:06:40.969> trap<00:06:41.330> game<00:06:41.569> and<00:06:41.870> thinking<00:06:42.710> of

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:42.889 
the real mouse trap game and thinking of

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:45.879 
the real mouse trap game and thinking of
ways<00:06:43.789> to<00:06:44.060> do<00:06:44.210> this<00:06:44.419> you<00:06:44.719> can<00:06:45.080> try<00:06:45.379> to<00:06:45.440> hide<00:06:45.710> the

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:45.889 
ways to do this you can try to hide the

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:49.510 
ways to do this you can try to hide the
Redstone<00:06:46.370> I<00:06:46.639> don't<00:06:47.419> really<00:06:47.690> need<00:06:48.259> to<00:06:48.560> or<00:06:49.280> want

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 
Redstone I don't really need to or want

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:55.510 
Redstone I don't really need to or want
