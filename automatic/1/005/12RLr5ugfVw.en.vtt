good morning this is Dwayne and today
we're<00:00:02.909> going<00:00:03.030> to<00:00:03.090> take<00:00:03.240> a<00:00:03.270> look<00:00:03.449> at<00:00:03.600> extended

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
we're going to take a look at extended

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.349 
we're going to take a look at extended
chords<00:00:04.680> what<00:00:04.890> our<00:00:05.009> extended<00:00:05.520> chords<00:00:05.940> and<00:00:06.089> what

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
chords what our extended chords and what

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.780 
chords what our extended chords and what
do<00:00:06.450> we<00:00:06.569> do<00:00:06.690> with<00:00:06.810> them<00:00:06.990> an<00:00:07.490> extended<00:00:08.490> chord<00:00:08.700> is

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
do we do with them an extended chord is

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.959 
do we do with them an extended chord is
any<00:00:08.970> chord<00:00:09.420> that<00:00:09.690> is<00:00:10.190> greater<00:00:11.190> than<00:00:11.340> an<00:00:11.580> octave

any chord that is greater than an octave

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.289 
any chord that is greater than an octave
okay<00:00:12.540> like<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.110> triad<00:00:13.530> that's<00:00:14.490> inside<00:00:15.120> an

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
okay like a triad that's inside an

all<00:00:38.790> those<00:00:38.940> chords<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.360> just<00:00:39.600> mentioned<00:00:39.989> are

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
all those chords I just mentioned are

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.760 
all those chords I just mentioned are
within<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.590> parameters<00:00:41.870> perimeters<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:43.079> an

within the parameters perimeters of an
octave<00:00:44.160> anytime<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.149> get<00:00:45.300> outside<00:00:45.750> that

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
octave anytime you get outside that

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.720 
octave anytime you get outside that
octave<00:00:46.440> it's<00:00:46.559> called<00:00:46.770> an<00:00:46.860> extended<00:00:47.219> chords

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
octave it's called an extended chords

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.650 
octave it's called an extended chords
for<00:00:47.910> example<00:00:48.329> if<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:49.079> play<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.649> C<00:00:49.829> chord<00:00:50.629> say<00:00:51.629> I

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
for example if I play the C chord say I

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.130 
for example if I play the C chord say I
played<00:00:52.050> c7<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:52.860> add<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.399> night<00:00:54.140> that's

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
played c7 that I add that night that's

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.250 
played c7 that I add that night that's
the<00:00:55.289> ninth<00:00:55.590> note<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.129> scale<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:57.260> it

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
the ninth note of the scale and it

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.229 
the ninth note of the scale and it
almost<00:00:58.590> always<00:00:58.920> includes<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.670> seventh<00:01:00.090> or

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
almost always includes the seventh or

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.139 
almost always includes the seventh or
the<00:01:00.300> major<00:01:00.629> 7th<00:01:01.199> ok<00:01:01.559> but<00:01:02.219> in<00:01:02.340> any<00:01:02.489> case<00:01:02.579> that's

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
the major 7th ok but in any case that's

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.270 
the major 7th ok but in any case that's
the<00:01:03.449> extension<00:01:04.110> that's<00:01:04.290> extended<00:01:05.040> because

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
the extension that's extended because

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.210 
the extension that's extended because
it's<00:01:05.460> greater<00:01:05.790> than<00:01:06.180> or<00:01:06.420> not<00:01:06.630> give<00:01:06.869> so<00:01:07.130> let<00:01:08.130> me

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
it's greater than or not give so let me

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.700 
it's greater than or not give so let me
move<00:01:08.369> down<00:01:08.430> here<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.820> little<00:01:09.290> that's<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.470> nice

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
move down here a little that's a nice

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.420 
move down here a little that's a nice
that's<00:01:11.100> 11th<00:01:12.119> that's<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.659> raised<00:01:12.900> alert

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
that's 11th that's a raised alert

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.500 
that's 11th that's a raised alert
that's<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.610> 13th

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.510 
that's a 13th

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.410 
that's a 13th
okay<00:01:17.080> so<00:01:17.680> any<00:01:18.130> any<00:01:18.460> chord<00:01:18.820> that's<00:01:19.000> greater

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
okay so any any chord that's greater

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.270 
okay so any any chord that's greater
than<00:01:19.540> an<00:01:19.780> octave<00:01:20.170> is<00:01:20.290> called<00:01:20.530> an<00:01:20.680> extended

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
than an octave is called an extended

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.880 
than an octave is called an extended
chord<00:01:21.640> now<00:01:22.210> how<00:01:22.390> do<00:01:22.450> you<00:01:22.510> use<00:01:22.750> them<00:01:22.930> well<00:01:23.560> you

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
chord now how do you use them well you

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.490 
chord now how do you use them well you
see<00:01:24.130> usually<00:01:24.640> use<00:01:24.820> some<00:01:25.000> inverted<00:01:25.630> it's<00:01:26.260> hard

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
see usually use some inverted it's hard

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.310 
see usually use some inverted it's hard
to<00:01:26.620> use<00:01:26.770> them<00:01:26.980> in<00:01:27.810> with<00:01:28.810> the<00:01:28.960> root<00:01:29.110> on<00:01:29.260> the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
to use them in with the root on the

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.460 
to use them in with the root on the
bottom<00:01:29.410> although<00:01:29.800> you<00:01:29.920> can<00:01:30.160> do<00:01:30.280> it<00:01:30.370> if<00:01:30.460> you

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
bottom although you can do it if you

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:40.560 
bottom although you can do it if you
let's<00:01:32.470> see<00:01:33.480> that's<00:01:36.900> that's<00:01:38.070> C<00:01:39.070> 13th<00:01:39.670> if<00:01:40.360> I

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
let's see that's that's C 13th if I

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.630 
let's see that's that's C 13th if I
leave<00:01:40.840> out<00:01:40.870> the<00:01:41.380> root<00:01:41.620> and<00:01:41.860> the<00:01:41.950> fifth<00:01:42.160> okay<00:01:42.460> I

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
leave out the root and the fifth okay I

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.500 
leave out the root and the fifth okay I
mean<00:01:44.220> so<00:01:45.220> you<00:01:45.280> don't<00:01:45.490> usually<00:01:45.700> find<00:01:46.090> them<00:01:46.330> that

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
mean so you don't usually find them that

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.290 
mean so you don't usually find them that
way<00:01:46.690> but<00:01:46.960> quite<00:01:47.920> often<00:01:48.250> in<00:01:48.370> jazz<00:01:48.700> you<00:01:48.970> hear

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
way but quite often in jazz you hear

00:01:49.300 --> 00:02:19.930 
way but quite often in jazz you hear
that<00:01:49.420> that<00:01:50.230> kind<00:01:50.620> of<00:01:50.740> sound<00:01:51.040> listen<00:01:51.340> to<00:01:51.430> this

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.560 

okay<00:02:20.940> you<00:02:21.000> get<00:02:21.210> the<00:02:21.390> idea<00:02:21.900> so<00:02:22.260> usually

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
okay you get the idea so usually

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.880 
okay you get the idea so usually
extended<00:02:24.570> chords<00:02:24.840> are<00:02:25.020> inverted<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:25.830> the

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
extended chords are inverted and the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.860 
extended chords are inverted and the
best<00:02:26.070> way<00:02:26.220> to<00:02:26.250> invert<00:02:27.210> them<00:02:27.360> with<00:02:27.540> your<00:02:27.660> left

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
best way to invert them with your left

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.920 
best way to invert them with your left
hand<00:02:28.020> I<00:02:28.170> found<00:02:28.410> is<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.010> play<00:02:29.490> a<00:02:29.520> low<00:02:29.820> root<00:02:30.090> and

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
hand I found is to play a low root and
