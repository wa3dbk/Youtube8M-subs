00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 thank you hi everyone here this is a 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.520
 girl gets upset and we end up for a 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.160
 kama tutorial so it's rare that I do 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.969
 because I do not like it that much 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.570
 a little fire story to please 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:18.500
 so here I end up with 15000 226 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:20.850
 in 15 million people we do not care 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:25.529
 and then just going to suffice 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:29.150
 to buy 666 to why 666 good 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.279
 question of the scales here you do 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:38.239
 there you open the emotional time like that 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:45.780
 once twice three times 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:46.770
 4 x 5 x 6 x and there you finally do not look 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:53.449
 it should not just have to convince 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.449
 670 euros here are his 166 you the winds 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.219
 must be very careful fobis done 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.290
 close the window like this here you are 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:10.490
 close then you wait a few 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:19.830
 happy moments of the second against 1 2 3 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:24.960
 4 5 6 7 8 and 10 so there you will have your 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:27.330
 window and the 670 million 660 6666 so 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.119
 why this sum do not know the 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.520
 devil and per minute maybe so 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:35.130
 so here's the khama trick is over 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.829
 so do not hesitate to try it especially 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.960
 three times no balance where it's 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.030
 works only once I have 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.740
 decided to change and then suddenly it's 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.610
 will put back your basic kama in fact 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.940
 too bad 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:52.510
 I do not understand why yet 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.920
 will still be checking so I 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.120
 leave you there then see you soon for 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.140
 other videos because I count 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:02.650
 resume maybe if no I 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:06.210
 maybe go we'll see maybe if 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:08.890
 you're lucky he had here 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:13.150
 no but seriously i may be 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:16.000
 take the videos and then here with 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.010
 this sum I think I have a billion 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.340
 next time i have you from the 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:32.380
 chance is otherwise second bug too 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:33.459
 write that you see it does not exist 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.860
 so it's easier at the bank 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:40.320
 paschal on board everyone gets tired 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.320
 have seen well since it was incredible 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:47.400
 but it just serves to say 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:56.019
 alas he will be there he will not be present 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:59.560
 in fact of the one present it is not 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:02.470
 present I understand well the coup 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:08.590
 rhinos always part in this heavy that has 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:10.860
 changed the match will be there again in a 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.860
 enclosure 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.440
 maybe there too 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.780
 oh no there he is not in the enclosure you 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:24.810
 can not click on it in fact you can 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:29.489
 not go on what the little embarrassment 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:32.910
 all you want to do and that is 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:37.739
 true there is no need to cheat or 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:42.600
 what can she do to him infinitely 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.959
 and make a mark like that and I 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.350
 thought 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.790
 that's probably going to be maybe maybe 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.940
 that I'm repeating myself in fact surely 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.720
 maybe resume the videos no I 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:59.540
 want to resume soon eight still there 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:05.630
 tomorrow night the expectations they drool 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:16.979
 it follows in fact we know it's not 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:23.060
 allybar you fat sign n have shown there he 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:23.060
 will have to wait two three seconds 4.28 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:34.669
 Unfortunately, he does not look more to the east by 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:36.660
 still there we meanwhile ben 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:45.330
 sing a song because I am 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:50.460
 confident and that's it again you do not want 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:57.680
 motivate us at worst I will put a 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:05:02.669
 dependent annotation no I looked 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:07.850
 I have a child here are the liberals 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:07.850
 but you really have 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:23.660
 so here we will see them take with 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:38.389
 we have no price there but small town like 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:43.820
 this is this guy there actually we do not go beyond 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:47.960
 even any abuse so that was it 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:50.810
 really the officials and for the trick 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:55.900
 kama it does not work that's because 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:59.389
 that I'm going to run out of stuff arguments 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:02.990
 the man that puts me to the second 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:04.310
 luck too late that's all and 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.949
 then next time for others 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:13.270
 videos what I plan to resume 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:13.270
 on the east nothing heard more
