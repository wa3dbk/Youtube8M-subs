00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
you'll find doing brothers together like

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.680 
you'll find doing brothers together like
that<00:03:32.100> they're<00:03:32.250> very<00:03:32.280> uncomfortable<00:03:33.180> and<00:03:33.570> it

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
that they're very uncomfortable and it

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.360 
that they're very uncomfortable and it
seems<00:03:34.019> like<00:03:34.260> they're<00:03:34.440> awfully<00:03:34.739> close<00:03:34.950> but<00:03:35.190> as

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
seems like they're awfully close but as

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.160 
seems like they're awfully close but as
you<00:03:35.670> note<00:03:35.880> in<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.269> close-up<00:03:36.480> it<00:03:36.810> looks<00:03:36.989> really
