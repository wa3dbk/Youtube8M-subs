they<00:01:09.180> would<00:01:09.210> we<00:01:09.420> make<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.689> for<00:01:09.810> last<00:01:09.930> gen

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
they would we make it for last gen

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.899 
they would we make it for last gen
because<00:01:10.680> at<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.950> end<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.159> day<00:01:11.310> these

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
because at the end of the day these

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.179 
because at the end of the day these
games<00:01:12.210> are<00:01:12.330> fairly<00:01:12.600> old<00:01:12.810> ok<00:01:13.170> there<00:01:13.380> for<00:01:13.590> 56

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
games are fairly old ok there for 56

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.429 
games are fairly old ok there for 56
years<00:01:14.340> old<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.820> don't<00:01:15.689> see<00:01:15.810> how<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.409> would

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
years old I don't see how that would

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.320 
years old I don't see how that would
bring<00:01:16.770> them<00:01:16.950> any<00:01:17.159> business<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.909> lot<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.150> people

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
bring them any business a lot of people

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.789 
bring them any business a lot of people
have<00:01:18.420> already<00:01:18.509> played<00:01:18.840> this<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.259> lot<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.619> people

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
have already played this a lot of people

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.380 
have already played this a lot of people
rehab<00:01:20.130> these<00:01:20.340> games<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.729> don't<00:01:20.939> know<00:01:21.000> and

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
rehab these games so I don't know and

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.580 
rehab these games so I don't know and
that<00:01:21.540> comes<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.960> conclusion<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.439> it

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
that comes to the conclusion that it

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.170 
that comes to the conclusion that it
could<00:01:22.770> be<00:01:22.799> made<00:01:23.070> for<00:01:23.250> next-gen<00:01:23.729> because<00:01:24.030> it

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
could be made for next-gen because it

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.609 
could be made for next-gen because it
wouldn't<00:01:24.420> make<00:01:24.509> any<00:01:24.659> sense<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.229> make<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.530> for

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
wouldn't make any sense to make it for

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.770 
wouldn't make any sense to make it for
last<00:01:25.710> gen<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:26.820> many<00:01:26.909> people<00:01:27.060> ready<00:01:27.330> have<00:01:27.600> it

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
last gen to so many people ready have it

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.840 
last gen to so many people ready have it
or<00:01:28.259> at<00:01:28.380> least<00:01:28.409> have<00:01:28.680> both<00:01:28.920> but<00:01:29.520> now<00:01:29.670> if<00:01:29.759> you

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
or at least have both but now if you

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.069 
or at least have both but now if you
think<00:01:30.030> about<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.270> fact<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.780> comes<00:01:30.930> for

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
think about the fact that it comes for

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.350 
think about the fact that it comes for
next-gen<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.860> could<00:01:32.159> make<00:01:32.280> amazing<00:01:32.670> sense<00:01:33.180> and

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
next-gen it could make amazing sense and

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.999 
next-gen it could make amazing sense and
at<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.479> same<00:01:33.630> time<00:01:33.689> we<00:01:33.960> can<00:01:33.990> lack<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.829> could

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009
