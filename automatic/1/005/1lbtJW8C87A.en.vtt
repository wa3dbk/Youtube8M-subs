register<00:00:49.010> when<00:00:50.010> not<00:00:50.160> at<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.430> register<00:00:50.879> pretty

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
register when not at the register pretty

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.709 
register when not at the register pretty
much<00:00:51.480> when<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.690> got<00:00:51.930> home<00:00:52.670> I'm<00:00:53.670> looking<00:00:54.300> over<00:00:54.570> my

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
much when I got home I'm looking over my

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.450 
much when I got home I'm looking over my
receipt<00:00:55.020> right<00:00:55.230> now<00:00:55.440> before<00:00:55.680> doing<00:00:55.890> this

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
receipt right now before doing this

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.970 
receipt right now before doing this
video<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:58.699> noticed<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.910> lot<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.120> error<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:00.980> you

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
video and noticed a lot of error so you

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.700 
video and noticed a lot of error so you
probably<00:01:02.670> won't<00:01:03.239> if<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.899> did<00:01:04.080> this<00:01:04.229> deal<00:01:04.530> you

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
probably won't if you did this deal you

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.740 
probably won't if you did this deal you
won't<00:01:04.860> have<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.189> same<00:01:05.489> total<00:01:05.939> as<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.479> did

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
won't have the same total as I did

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.359 
won't have the same total as I did
because<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.260> was<00:01:07.290> messed<00:01:07.619> up<00:01:07.770> but<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.070> still

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
because it was messed up but I still

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.250 
because it was messed up but I still
wanted<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.700> share<00:01:09.200> so<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.380> tide<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:12.200> 594<00:01:13.200> I

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
wanted to share so the tide is 594 I

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.960 
wanted to share so the tide is 594 I
believe<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:13.860> don't<00:01:14.040> have<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.280> add<00:01:14.430> in<00:01:14.610> front<00:01:14.880> of

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
believe I don't have to add in front of

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.469 
believe I don't have to add in front of
me<00:01:15.090> but<00:01:15.869> these<00:01:16.259> ended<00:01:16.680> up<00:01:16.770> bringing<00:01:16.979> up<00:01:17.479> $7.99

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
me but these ended up bringing up $7.99

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.480 
me but these ended up bringing up $7.99
because<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:18.900> think<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.409> probably<00:01:19.619> was<00:01:20.040> just<00:01:20.310> for

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
because I think it probably was just for

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.330 
because I think it probably was just for
the<00:01:20.610> tide<00:01:20.960> regular<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:22.259> don't<00:01:22.619> really<00:01:22.890> know<00:01:23.070> the
