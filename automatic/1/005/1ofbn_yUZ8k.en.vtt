00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
I'll put a down a little bit description

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.119 
I'll put a down a little bit description
basically<00:00:50.879> now<00:00:51.149> in<00:00:51.329> here<00:00:51.449> I'm<00:00:52.199> actually<00:00:52.860> going

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129

to<00:00:53.219> go<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:54.030> wherever<00:00:54.239> your<00:00:54.539> code<00:00:54.690> or<00:00:54.809> to

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
to go to wherever your code or to

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.049 
to go to wherever your code or to
directories<00:00:55.320> for<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.430> guys<00:00:56.579> it's<00:00:56.820> probably

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
directories for you guys it's probably

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.849 
directories for you guys it's probably
located<00:00:57.780> on<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.050> start<00:00:58.320> my<00:00:58.980> computer<00:01:00.710> so<00:01:01.710> I've

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
located on to start my computer so I've

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.219 
located on to start my computer so I've
C<00:01:02.190> or<00:01:02.579> whatever<00:01:03.000> drive<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.870> is<00:01:05.780> program<00:01:06.780> I

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
C or whatever drive it is program I

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.330 
C or whatever drive it is program I
think<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.560> would<00:01:07.650> be<00:01:07.770> under<00:01:08.600> 86<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.780> believe<00:01:10.049> I'm

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
think it would be under 86 I believe I'm

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.890 
think it would be under 86 I believe I'm
not<00:01:11.340> sure<00:01:11.760> because<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.270> don't<00:01:12.659> have<00:01:12.840> it

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
not sure because I don't have it

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.320 
not sure because I don't have it
installed<00:01:13.140> under<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.799> my<00:01:13.890> Program<00:01:14.220> Files<00:01:14.430> but

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
installed under to my Program Files but

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.820 
installed under to my Program Files but
for<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.630> guys<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:15.990> you're<00:01:16.140> using<00:01:16.259> Vista<00:01:16.680> or

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
for you guys that you're using Vista or

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.230 
for you guys that you're using Vista or
7<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:17.220> believe<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.549> will<00:01:17.640> get<00:01:17.759> rid<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:17.970> 80

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
7 I believe it will get rid of 80

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.010 
7 I believe it will get rid of 80
actually<00:01:19.110> if<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.320> have<00:01:19.580> 64-bit<00:01:20.900> they'd<00:01:21.900> be

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
actually if you have 64-bit they'd be

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.190 
actually if you have 64-bit they'd be
under<00:01:22.229> 86<00:01:22.710> if<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.790> have<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.000> normal<00:01:24.570> 32-bit

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
under 86 if you have a normal 32-bit

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.840 
under 86 if you have a normal 32-bit
it'd<00:01:25.380> be<00:01:25.530> under<00:01:25.710> Program<00:01:26.070> Files<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.580> way<00:01:26.790> to

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
it'd be under Program Files the way to

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.120 
it'd be under Program Files the way to
find<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.210> out<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.710> right<00:01:28.710> clicking<00:01:28.920> on

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
find that out is right clicking on

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.109 
find that out is right clicking on
computer<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.850> going<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.420> properties<00:01:30.630> and

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
computer and going to properties and

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.380 
computer and going to properties and
you'll<00:01:33.119> see<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.390> again<00:01:33.479> in<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.689> second<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:35.390> I

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
you'll see it again in a second and I

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.600 
you'll see it again in a second and I
have<00:01:36.689> 6<00:01:36.930> gigs<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.290> RAM<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:38.280> says<00:01:38.430> right

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
have 6 gigs of RAM and it says right

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.280 
have 6 gigs of RAM and it says right
below<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.079> 64-bit<00:01:40.079> operating<00:01:40.320> system<00:01:40.880> so

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
below that 64-bit operating system so

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:49.999 
below that 64-bit operating system so
what<00:01:43.290> is<00:01:43.500> this<00:01:44.840> know<00:01:48.290> so<00:01:49.290> for<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.649> guys<00:01:49.710> you'd

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
what is this know so for you guys you'd

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.100 
what is this know so for you guys you'd
go<00:01:50.159> under<00:01:50.430> if<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:50.880> have<00:01:51.000> 64-bit<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:51.780> going<00:01:51.990> to

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
go under if you have 64-bit you going to

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.740 
go under if you have 64-bit you going to
