00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.900
 known as nelson 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.970

 is an abbreviated writing system in 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:14.390
 general uses signals drawn from geometry 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:49.480
 there are shorthand systems whose signals 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:49.480
 are taken from ordinary letters because they are 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:02:11.619
 allows for fast 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.619
 phonetic writing 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:22.750
