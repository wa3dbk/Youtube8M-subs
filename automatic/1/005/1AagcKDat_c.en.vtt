which is my new favorite studio on earth
recently<00:00:26.570> and<00:00:26.779> we<00:00:27.529> worked<00:00:27.770> with<00:00:27.890> Tori<00:00:28.250> and

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
recently and we worked with Tori and

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.120 
recently and we worked with Tori and
summer<00:00:28.669> down<00:00:28.910> there<00:00:29.150> we<00:00:29.329> attract<00:00:30.259> some<00:00:30.829> stuff

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
summer down there we attract some stuff

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.450 
summer down there we attract some stuff
and<00:00:31.930> was<00:00:32.930> real<00:00:33.110> happy<00:00:33.410> with<00:00:33.560> it<00:00:33.620> came<00:00:34.070> back<00:00:34.250> to

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
and was real happy with it came back to

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.340 
and was real happy with it came back to
LA<00:00:34.610> started<00:00:35.329> playing<00:00:35.600> with<00:00:35.750> it<00:00:35.930> and<00:00:36.050> thought

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
LA started playing with it and thought

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.639 
LA started playing with it and thought
maybe<00:00:36.500> the<00:00:36.739> snare<00:00:37.070> could<00:00:37.250> have<00:00:37.399> a<00:00:37.430> little<00:00:37.610> more

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:38.649 
maybe the snare could have a little more

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:44.799 
maybe the snare could have a little more
roundness<00:00:39.649> and<00:00:39.950> bottom<00:00:40.340> to<00:00:40.579> it<00:00:41.590> I<00:00:43.420> was<00:00:44.420> working

Decapitator on I'm like man I don't want
any<00:01:23.780> distortion<00:01:24.410> and<00:01:24.640> and<00:01:25.640> we're<00:01:26.420> not<00:01:26.570> really

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
any distortion and and we're not really

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.480 
any distortion and and we're not really
adding<00:01:27.140> distortion<00:01:27.680> what<00:01:27.860> we're<00:01:28.010> adding<00:01:28.220> is

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
adding distortion what we're adding is

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.090 
adding distortion what we're adding is
just<00:01:28.700> a<00:01:28.820> we're<00:01:29.570> setting<00:01:29.990> up<00:01:30.140> the<00:01:30.200> plugin<00:01:30.800> so

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
just a we're setting up the plugin so

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.790 
just a we're setting up the plugin so
that<00:01:31.280> where<00:01:31.460> we're<00:01:31.880> using<00:01:32.690> low<00:01:33.110> frequency

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
that where we're using low frequency

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.690 
that where we're using low frequency
information<00:01:34.220> and<00:01:35.030> then<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:35.420> mix<00:01:35.660> knob<00:01:35.930> to<00:01:36.200> add

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
information and then the mix knob to add

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.400 
information and then the mix knob to add
low<00:01:37.700> frequency<00:01:38.300> information<00:01:38.870> without

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
low frequency information without

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.540 
low frequency information without
actually<00:01:40.280> just<00:01:40.520> cranking<00:01:41.090> up<00:01:41.920> an<00:01:42.920> equaliser

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
actually just cranking up an equaliser

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.070 
actually just cranking up an equaliser
we<00:01:43.850> could<00:01:44.000> do<00:01:44.090> that<00:01:44.270> sure<00:01:44.660> that<00:01:44.930> would<00:01:45.050> work

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
we could do that sure that would work

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.590 
we could do that sure that would work
but<00:01:45.800> this<00:01:45.950> is<00:01:46.190> think<00:01:46.610> of<00:01:46.700> this<00:01:46.820> is<00:01:47.060> adding<00:01:47.450> low

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
but this is think of this is adding low

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.300 
but this is think of this is adding low
frequency<00:01:48.170> information<00:01:48.290> that<00:01:48.860> has<00:01:49.040> some

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
frequency information that has some

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.120 
frequency information that has some
saturation<00:01:49.550> and<00:01:50.180> texture<00:01:50.600> to<00:01:50.630> it<00:01:50.810> so<00:01:51.200> we<00:01:51.980> got

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
saturation and texture to it so we got

00:01:52.130 --> 00:02:03.010 
saturation and texture to it so we got
without<00:01:52.490> it<00:01:54.520> with<00:01:55.520> it

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.600 

now<00:02:04.020> if<00:02:04.110> I<00:02:04.230> exaggerate<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.890> mix<00:02:05.100> knob<00:02:05.340> you'll

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
now if I exaggerate the mix knob you'll

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:19.550 
now if I exaggerate the mix knob you'll
hear<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.820> little<00:02:05.970> better<00:02:18.050> now<00:02:19.050> of<00:02:19.110> course<00:02:19.320> it's

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
hear a little better now of course it's

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.640 
hear a little better now of course it's
getting<00:02:19.710> a<00:02:19.860> little<00:02:20.100> louder<00:02:20.280> too<00:02:20.960> and<00:02:21.960> then<00:02:22.380> and

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
getting a little louder too and then and

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.380 
getting a little louder too and then and
then<00:02:22.800> we<00:02:22.890> can<00:02:23.100> we<00:02:23.670> can<00:02:25.490> massage<00:02:26.490> the<00:02:26.790> tone<00:02:27.060> so

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
then we can we can massage the tone so

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:35.650 
then we can we can massage the tone so
we<00:02:27.540> can<00:02:27.690> just<00:02:27.870> as<00:02:27.990> easily<00:02:28.140> add<00:02:28.470> some<00:02:28.650> top<00:02:28.890> in

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:46.240 

and<00:02:39.890> drive<00:02:40.890> is<00:02:41.100> kicked<00:02:41.340> up<00:02:41.520> pretty<00:02:41.730> good

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.680 

now<00:02:47.250> we<00:02:47.310> can<00:02:47.550> get<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:47.760> little<00:02:47.940> nuts<00:02:48.240> with<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.570> if

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
now we can get a little nuts with it if

00:02:48.690 --> 00:03:02.840 
now we can get a little nuts with it if
we<00:02:48.840> wanted<00:02:49.110> watch<00:02:49.320> this<00:03:01.400> okay<00:03:02.400> let's<00:03:02.550> try<00:03:02.730> it

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
we wanted watch this okay let's try it

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.699 
we wanted watch this okay let's try it
in<00:03:02.970> our<00:03:03.090> track<00:03:03.390> it's<00:03:04.080> gonna<00:03:04.260> be<00:03:04.380> a<00:03:04.440> little<00:03:04.620> more

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
in our track it's gonna be a little more

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.320 
in our track it's gonna be a little more
subtle<00:03:04.950> on<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.220> track<00:03:05.459> because<00:03:05.640> I<00:03:05.760> got<00:03:05.940> I<00:03:06.090> got

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
subtle on the track because I got I got

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:17.330 
subtle on the track because I got I got
other<00:03:06.480> kick

anyway Flynn with the distortion which

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.680 
anyway Flynn with the distortion which
is<00:03:39.890> your<00:03:40.069> friend<00:03:40.340> remember<00:03:40.790> distortion<00:03:41.569> is

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
is your friend remember distortion is

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.140 
is your friend remember distortion is
not<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:42.110> Elephant<00:03:42.590> Man<00:03:42.769> it's<00:03:43.400> a<00:03:43.730> rich

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
not the Elephant Man it's a rich

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.970 
not the Elephant Man it's a rich
collection<00:03:44.720> of<00:03:44.780> harmonics<00:03:45.379> I<00:03:45.530> think<00:03:45.739> of<00:03:45.860> it

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
collection of harmonics I think of it

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.259 
collection of harmonics I think of it
that<00:03:46.010> way<00:03:46.310> we're<00:03:46.519> enhancing<00:03:46.760> the<00:03:47.120> low

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
that way we're enhancing the low

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.509 
that way we're enhancing the low
frequency<00:03:47.810> harmonics<00:03:48.349> we<00:03:48.470> could<00:03:48.620> enhance<00:03:49.099> the

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
frequency harmonics we could enhance the

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.940 
frequency harmonics we could enhance the
high<00:03:49.640> frequency<00:03:50.180> harmonics<00:03:50.860> experiment<00:03:51.860> with

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
high frequency harmonics experiment with

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.860 
high frequency harmonics experiment with
this<00:03:52.040> plug-in<00:03:52.340> and<00:03:52.879> or<00:03:53.180> any<00:03:53.690> of<00:03:53.840> your<00:03:53.959> favorite

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
this plug-in and or any of your favorite

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.250 
this plug-in and or any of your favorite
distortion<00:03:56.870> saturation<00:03:57.560> type<00:03:58.370> plugins<00:03:58.849> and

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
distortion saturation type plugins and

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.600 
distortion saturation type plugins and
this<00:04:00.260> one<00:04:00.410> has<00:04:00.560> a<00:04:00.640> lot<00:04:01.640> of<00:04:03.370> flexibility<00:04:04.370> and

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
this one has a lot of flexibility and

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.009 
this one has a lot of flexibility and
you<00:04:05.269> can<00:04:05.420> see<00:04:05.650> we're<00:04:06.650> doing<00:04:06.829> a<00:04:07.360> kind<00:04:08.360> of<00:04:08.450> song

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
you can see we're doing a kind of song

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:11.740 
you can see we're doing a kind of song
that<00:04:09.049> doesn't<00:04:09.319> require<00:04:09.760> big<00:04:10.760> drums<00:04:11.120> they<00:04:11.510> just

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
that doesn't require big drums they just

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.610 
that doesn't require big drums they just
need<00:04:12.310> credible<00:04:13.310> drums<00:04:13.700> and<00:04:14.200> you<00:04:15.200> can<00:04:15.319> go<00:04:15.440> from

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
need credible drums and you can go from

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.080 
need credible drums and you can go from
subtle<00:04:16.010> to<00:04:16.250> extreme<00:04:17.030> okay<00:04:18.519> obvious<00:04:19.519> from<00:04:19.789> echo
