link<00:00:44.860> Michelle<00:00:45.340> this<00:00:45.850> material<00:00:46.360> is<00:00:46.450> going<00:00:46.629> to

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
link Michelle this material is going to

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.229 
link Michelle this material is going to
flow<00:00:46.960> plenty<00:00:47.500> of<00:00:47.590> air<00:00:47.770> basically<00:00:48.340> it's<00:00:48.730> porous

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
flow plenty of air basically it's porous

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.119

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
down a full size but if you're kind of

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.210 
down a full size but if you're kind of
in<00:02:16.180> between<00:02:16.299> sizes<00:02:16.720> you<00:02:17.379> can<00:02:17.530> maybe<00:02:17.799> take<00:02:18.010> that

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
in between sizes you can maybe take that

two-stage<00:02:27.849> liner<00:02:28.150> we<00:02:28.329> were<00:02:28.450> talking<00:02:28.810> about

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
two-stage liner we were talking about

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.979 
two-stage liner we were talking about
basically<00:02:29.860> you<00:02:29.950> have<00:02:30.160> an<00:02:30.400> aqua<00:02:30.760> firm<00:02:31.000> liner<00:02:31.690> on

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
basically you have an aqua firm liner on

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.270 
basically you have an aqua firm liner on
the<00:02:32.170> outside<00:02:32.590> that's<00:02:32.829> basically<00:02:33.190> a

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
the outside that's basically a

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.789 
the outside that's basically a
waterproof<00:02:33.940> liner<00:02:34.810> on<00:02:35.079> the<00:02:35.110> outer<00:02:35.379> portion

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
waterproof liner on the outer portion

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.670 
waterproof liner on the outer portion
and<00:02:36.250> then<00:02:36.730> a<00:02:37.060> thermal<00:02:37.780> liner<00:02:38.019> on<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.319> inner

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
and then a thermal liner on the inner

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.410 
and then a thermal liner on the inner
portion<00:02:38.950> and<00:02:39.340> you'll<00:02:39.640> see<00:02:39.790> there's<00:02:40.030> actually

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
portion and you'll see there's actually

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.180 
portion and you'll see there's actually
a<00:02:40.450> nice<00:02:40.599> rain<00:02:40.930> flap<00:02:41.200> here<00:02:41.470> so<00:02:41.709> if<00:02:41.860> you<00:02:41.890> wanted

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
a nice rain flap here so if you wanted

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.069 
a nice rain flap here so if you wanted
to<00:02:42.310> zip<00:02:42.519> that<00:02:42.670> together<00:02:42.879> there's<00:02:43.599> a<00:02:43.660> Velcro

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
to zip that together there's a Velcro

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:45.420 
to zip that together there's a Velcro
that's<00:02:44.500> actually<00:02:44.650> going<00:02:44.920> to<00:02:45.010> form<00:02:45.220> a<00:02:45.280> nice

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
that's actually going to form a nice

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.380 
that's actually going to form a nice
waterproof<00:02:45.940> seal<00:02:46.450> at<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.810> main<00:02:46.989> zipper<00:02:47.410> and

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
waterproof seal at the main zipper and

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.660 
waterproof seal at the main zipper and
then<00:02:49.390> on<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:49.870> inside<00:02:50.019> you<00:02:50.379> have<00:02:50.560> a<00:02:50.799> thermal

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
then on the inside you have a thermal

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.880 
then on the inside you have a thermal
liner<00:02:51.879> so<00:02:52.180> it's<00:02:52.299> a<00:02:52.359> two-stage<00:02:52.810> liner<00:02:53.140> if<00:02:53.349> it's

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
liner so it's a two-stage liner if it's

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.910 
liner so it's a two-stage liner if it's
warm<00:02:54.370> and<00:02:54.579> just<00:02:54.879> raining<00:02:55.180> you<00:02:55.810> can<00:02:55.989> run<00:02:56.319> just

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
warm and just raining you can run just

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.949 
warm and just raining you can run just
the<00:02:57.129> third<00:02:57.370> just<00:02:57.879> the<00:02:58.030> waterproof<00:02:58.480> liner<00:02:58.720> and

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
the third just the waterproof liner and

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.620 
the third just the waterproof liner and
then<00:02:59.530> if<00:02:59.769> you<00:03:00.190> need<00:03:00.549> the<00:03:00.730> additional<00:03:01.060> warmth

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
then if you need the additional warmth

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.660 
then if you need the additional warmth
of<00:03:01.810> a<00:03:02.109> thermal<00:03:02.470> liner<00:03:02.650> for<00:03:03.010> cooler<00:03:03.220> parts<00:03:03.579> of

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
of a thermal liner for cooler parts of

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.339 
of a thermal liner for cooler parts of
the<00:03:03.760> year<00:03:03.940> obviously<00:03:04.660> this<00:03:04.989> is<00:03:05.139> going<00:03:05.290> to

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
the year obviously this is going to

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.020 
the year obviously this is going to
block<00:03:05.530> a<00:03:05.560> lot<00:03:05.829> of<00:03:05.950> wind<00:03:06.130> and<00:03:06.340> then<00:03:06.730> this<00:03:06.910> is

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
block a lot of wind and then this is

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.059 
block a lot of wind and then this is
going<00:03:07.209> to<00:03:07.299> keep<00:03:07.450> you<00:03:07.569> warm<00:03:07.810> on<00:03:08.079> the<00:03:08.530> inside<00:03:08.560> as

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
going to keep you warm on the inside as

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:10.860 
going to keep you warm on the inside as
well<00:03:09.099> keep<00:03:09.670> in<00:03:09.790> mind<00:03:09.970> that<00:03:10.060> with<00:03:10.239> two<00:03:10.450> liners

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
well keep in mind that with two liners

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.110 
well keep in mind that with two liners
it<00:03:11.139> does<00:03:11.440> add<00:03:11.680> a<00:03:11.919> little<00:03:12.250> bit<00:03:12.459> of<00:03:12.519> bulk<00:03:12.849> to<00:03:13.090> the

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
it does add a little bit of bulk to the

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.120 
it does add a little bit of bulk to the
jacket<00:03:13.599> but<00:03:13.780> the<00:03:14.019> waterproof<00:03:14.709> liner<00:03:14.950> is

super hot sweaty but keep in mind does

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.940 
super hot sweaty but keep in mind does
block<00:03:37.329> plenty<00:03:37.780> of<00:03:37.870> wind<00:03:38.109> so<00:03:38.319> it<00:03:38.410> does<00:03:38.560> help<00:03:38.799> the

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
block plenty of wind so it does help the

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.910 
block plenty of wind so it does help the
jacket<00:03:39.340> keep<00:03:39.790> you<00:03:39.940> warm<00:03:40.180> in<00:03:40.419> who

jacket keep you warm in who

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.650 
jacket keep you warm in who
and<00:03:41.280> then<00:03:41.730> you'll<00:03:41.880> see<00:03:42.000> if<00:03:42.060> they<00:03:42.180> use<00:03:42.300> elastic

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
and then you'll see if they use elastic

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.449 
and then you'll see if they use elastic
around<00:03:42.990> the<00:03:43.140> bottom<00:03:43.500> with<00:03:43.620> some<00:03:43.800> silicone<00:03:44.280> on

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
around the bottom with some silicone on

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.850 
around the bottom with some silicone on
it<00:03:44.610> and<00:03:44.790> that<00:03:44.819> helps<00:03:45.450> keep<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:46.050> liner<00:03:46.319> down<00:03:46.620> in

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
it and that helps keep the liner down in

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.680 
it and that helps keep the liner down in
place<00:03:47.130> as<00:03:47.370> you're<00:03:47.550> writing<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:48.420> other<00:03:48.540> thing

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
place as you're writing the other thing

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.089 
place as you're writing the other thing
I<00:03:48.780> really<00:03:48.989> like<00:03:49.140> about<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.470> way<00:03:49.590> core<00:03:49.860> tech

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
and tourmaster do their liners is they

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.630 
and tourmaster do their liners is they
color<00:03:52.349> code<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:52.890> snap<00:03:53.130> so<00:03:53.340> you'll<00:03:53.459> see

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
color code the snap so you'll see

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.550 
color code the snap so you'll see
there's<00:03:53.849> a<00:03:53.910> snap<00:03:54.510> with<00:03:54.540> elastic<00:03:55.140> loop<00:03:55.319> here

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
there's a snap with elastic loop here

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.530 
there's a snap with elastic loop here
and<00:03:55.739> basically<00:03:56.190> that<00:03:56.880> so<00:03:57.120> that<00:03:57.270> you<00:03:57.390> can

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
and basically that so that you can

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.360 
and basically that so that you can
quickly<00:03:58.020> and<00:03:58.260> easily<00:03:58.350> find<00:03:58.860> and<00:03:59.100> identify

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
where all those snaps line up obviously

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.010 
where all those snaps line up obviously
since<00:04:02.730> there's<00:04:02.970> two<00:04:03.180> liners<00:04:03.569> in<00:04:03.690> this<00:04:03.810> traffic
