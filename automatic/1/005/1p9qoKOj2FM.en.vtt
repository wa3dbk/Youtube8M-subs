00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
anything again so i think what older was

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.799 
anything again so i think what older was
trying<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.250> do<00:01:02.370> was<00:01:02.399> basically<00:01:02.640> she's<00:01:03.480> not<00:01:03.780> a

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
trying to do was basically she's not a

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.329 
trying to do was basically she's not a
badass<00:01:04.229> he<00:01:04.409> never<00:01:04.589> was<00:01:04.739> meant<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:04.979> be<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.100> badass

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
badass he never was meant to be a badass

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.530 
badass he never was meant to be a badass
you<00:01:05.700> would<00:01:05.790> never<00:01:05.880> meant<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.240> even<00:01:06.420> be<00:01:06.510> a

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
you would never meant to even be a

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.179 
you would never meant to even be a
fighter<00:01:06.810> for<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.170> matter<00:01:07.380> she<00:01:07.740> had<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.979> just

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
fighter for that matter she had to just

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.399 
fighter for that matter she had to just
maintain<00:01:08.310> enough<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.479> daddy<00:01:09.780> can<00:01:09.960> come<00:01:10.260> back

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
maintain enough so daddy can come back

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.080 
maintain enough so daddy can come back
and<00:01:10.590> save<00:01:11.040> his<00:01:11.189> little<00:01:11.460> girl<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:11.640> think<00:01:11.760> that's

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
and save his little girl I think that's

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.429 
and save his little girl I think that's
what<00:01:12.240> older<00:01:12.540> was<00:01:12.659> trying<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.020> do<00:01:13.140> with<00:01:13.290> this

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
what older was trying to do with this

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.320 
what older was trying to do with this
one<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.830> if<00:01:14.220> he<00:01:14.369> did<00:01:14.610> it's<00:01:14.909> starting<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.210> make

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
one and if he did it's starting to make

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.550 
one and if he did it's starting to make
a<00:01:15.360> little<00:01:15.420> more<00:01:15.659> sense<00:01:15.930> still<00:01:16.200> doesn't<00:01:16.500> make

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
a little more sense still doesn't make

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.350 
a little more sense still doesn't make
up<00:01:16.740> for<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.979> fact<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.280> Rebecca's<00:01:17.970> crying<00:01:18.270> a

after you lift another sword again it

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.770 
after you lift another sword again it
makes<00:01:26.369> more<00:01:26.549> sense<00:01:26.610> that's<00:01:27.000> where<00:01:27.330> older<00:01:27.659> was

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
makes more sense that's where older was

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.240 
makes more sense that's where older was
trying<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.080> go<00:01:28.200> with<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.500> so<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:28.920> chapter

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
trying to go with that so this chapter

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.710 
trying to go with that so this chapter
yet<00:01:29.369> again<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.820> seems<00:01:29.970> as<00:01:30.180> though<00:01:30.210> every

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
yet again it seems as though every

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.200 
yet again it seems as though every
chapter<00:01:30.960> while<00:01:31.290> again<00:01:31.979> arguably<00:01:32.700> we<00:01:32.850> do<00:01:33.000> want

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
chapter while again arguably we do want

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.490 
chapter while again arguably we do want
to<00:01:33.240> see<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.450> dough<00:01:33.570> flamingo<00:01:33.960> luffy<00:01:34.259> stuff

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
to see the dough flamingo luffy stuff

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.830 
to see the dough flamingo luffy stuff
etc<00:01:34.650> etc<00:01:35.030> ultimately<00:01:36.030> we're<00:01:36.270> wrapping<00:01:36.720> this

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
etc etc ultimately we're wrapping this

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.810 
etc etc ultimately we're wrapping this
arc<00:01:37.140> up<00:01:37.320> odors<00:01:37.710> finishing<00:01:38.250> one<00:01:38.430> fight<00:01:38.670> off

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
the straw hats and i like that because

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.530

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
very interesting again kind of making a

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.430 
very interesting again kind of making a
little<00:04:18.180> bit<00:04:18.359> more<00:04:18.510> that<00:04:18.690> Fishman<00:04:18.900> Island<00:04:19.140> and

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
little bit more that Fishman Island and

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.320 
little bit more that Fishman Island and
if<00:04:19.530> that's<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:19.830> case<00:04:19.890> if<00:04:20.160> he's<00:04:20.310> a<00:04:20.340> crossbreed

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
if that's the case if he's a crossbreed

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.150 
if that's the case if he's a crossbreed
then<00:04:21.840> if<00:04:22.169> there's<00:04:22.410> more<00:04:22.560> cross<00:04:22.860> breeze

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
then if there's more cross breeze

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.520 
then if there's more cross breeze
between<00:04:23.340> humans<00:04:23.910> and<00:04:24.060> fish<00:04:24.360> then<00:04:24.960> maybe<00:04:25.260> we

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
between humans and fish then maybe we

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:26.970 
between humans and fish then maybe we
can<00:04:25.560> you<00:04:25.800> know<00:04:25.890> close<00:04:26.160> the<00:04:26.310> gap<00:04:26.490> on<00:04:26.520> that

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
can you know close the gap on that

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.590 
can you know close the gap on that
and<00:04:27.490> then<00:04:27.610> at<00:04:27.730> the<00:04:27.760> end<00:04:27.850> of<00:04:28.060> the<00:04:28.150> chapter<00:04:28.360> were

whatever<00:05:01.600> this<00:05:02.020> chapter<00:05:02.230> is<00:05:02.380> better<00:05:02.590> than<00:05:02.740> by

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
whatever this chapter is better than by

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.070 
whatever this chapter is better than by
the<00:05:03.310> way<00:05:03.490> like<00:05:03.760> last<00:05:04.030> I<00:05:04.240> think<00:05:04.450> two<00:05:04.630> chapters

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
the way like last I think two chapters

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.990 
the way like last I think two chapters
like<00:05:05.350> that<00:05:05.530> because<00:05:05.830> this<00:05:06.190> just<00:05:06.550> had<00:05:06.730> better

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
like that because this just had better

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.300 
like that because this just had better
content<00:05:07.480> to<00:05:07.570> it<00:05:07.660> just<00:05:07.930> felt<00:05:08.350> a<00:05:08.470> lot<00:05:08.590> better<00:05:08.770> so

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
content to it just felt a lot better so

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.520 
content to it just felt a lot better so
good<00:05:10.000> on<00:05:10.090> that<00:05:10.210> aspect<00:05:10.480> but<00:05:10.750> just<00:05:11.230> the<00:05:11.500> fact

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
good on that aspect but just the fact

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:12.900 
good on that aspect but just the fact
that<00:05:11.800> we're<00:05:11.980> getting<00:05:12.070> yet<00:05:12.340> again<00:05:12.670> now

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
that we're getting yet again now

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.850 
that we're getting yet again now
Dillinger's<00:05:13.540> out<00:05:13.690> even<00:05:13.990> though<00:05:14.140> he<00:05:14.320> kind<00:05:14.770> of

Haku was awakened that kind of shows
that<00:05:19.330> like<00:05:19.480> the<00:05:19.690> setups<00:05:20.110> that<00:05:20.200> happened<00:05:20.740> if<00:05:20.860> we

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
that like the setups that happened if we

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.860 
that like the setups that happened if we
didn't<00:05:21.520> know<00:05:21.610> who<00:05:21.730> Kevin<00:05:22.060> this<00:05:22.210> was<00:05:22.480> we

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
didn't know who Kevin this was we

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.720 
didn't know who Kevin this was we
wouldn't<00:05:23.140> give<00:05:23.380> a<00:05:23.410> fuck<00:05:23.860> about<00:05:23.890> hockey<00:05:24.400> but<00:05:24.550> if

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.310 
wouldn't give a fuck about hockey but if
we<00:05:24.850> didn't<00:05:25.090> know<00:05:25.150> who<00:05:25.300> hockey<00:05:25.570> but<00:05:25.810> was<00:05:26.020> the

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
we didn't know who hockey but was the

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.600 
we didn't know who hockey but was the
awakening<00:05:26.830> that<00:05:26.920> he<00:05:27.040> gets<00:05:27.220> me<00:05:27.340> basically

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
awakening that he gets me basically

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.760 
awakening that he gets me basically
knocked<00:05:28.000> the<00:05:28.150> fuck<00:05:28.360> out<00:05:28.510> it<00:05:28.780> wouldn't<00:05:29.440> matter

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
knocked the fuck out it wouldn't matter

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.710 
knocked the fuck out it wouldn't matter
so<00:05:30.220> the<00:05:30.580> fact<00:05:30.820> that<00:05:30.910> all<00:05:31.150> that<00:05:31.360> build-up

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 
so the fact that all that build-up

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.890 
so the fact that all that build-up
happened<00:05:32.200> and<00:05:32.350> now<00:05:32.800> it's<00:05:32.980> paying<00:05:33.220> off<00:05:33.430> is<00:05:33.640> like

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
happened and now it's paying off is like

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.540 
happened and now it's paying off is like
okay<00:05:34.900> older<00:05:35.170> you<00:05:35.320> planted<00:05:35.890> some<00:05:36.040> seeds<00:05:36.070> and

okay older you planted some seeds and
how<00:05:36.640> they<00:05:36.790> came<00:05:36.970> to<00:05:37.030> fruition<00:05:37.420> and<00:05:37.780> you're

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
how they came to fruition and you're

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.810 
how they came to fruition and you're
using<00:05:38.170> them<00:05:38.380> properly<00:05:38.410> those<00:05:39.190> are<00:05:39.370> signs<00:05:39.520> of<00:05:39.760> a

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
using them properly those are signs of a

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.100 
using them properly those are signs of a
great<00:05:40.030> writer<00:05:40.270> see<00:05:40.570> I'm<00:05:40.660> gonna<00:05:40.750> give<00:05:40.870> this<00:05:40.960> one

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
great writer see I'm gonna give this one

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.930 
great writer see I'm gonna give this one
like<00:05:41.200> a<00:05:41.230> seven<00:05:41.770> and<00:05:41.860> a<00:05:42.010> half<00:05:42.040> to<00:05:42.520> an<00:05:42.640> eight<00:05:42.910> I

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
like a seven and a half to an eight I

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.880 
like a seven and a half to an eight I
can't<00:05:43.630> decide<00:05:44.020> between<00:05:44.140> the<00:05:44.380> two<00:05:44.500> because<00:05:44.620> I

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:44.890 
can't decide between the two because I

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.290 
can't decide between the two because I
think<00:05:45.040> they<00:05:45.310> did<00:05:45.580> wrap<00:05:45.760> up<00:05:45.940> we<00:05:46.030> did<00:05:46.180> get

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
think they did wrap up we did get

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.880 
think they did wrap up we did get
progression<00:05:46.780> but<00:05:46.930> once<00:05:47.470> again<00:05:47.590> a<00:05:47.680> lot<00:05:47.830> of

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:47.890 
progression but once again a lot of

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.380 
progression but once again a lot of
comedy<00:05:48.310> in<00:05:48.340> this<00:05:48.520> one<00:05:48.670> and<00:05:48.760> while<00:05:48.880> comedy<00:05:49.300> is

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:49.390 
comedy in this one and while comedy is

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:50.790 
comedy in this one and while comedy is
no<00:05:49.600> funny<00:05:49.840> and<00:05:49.990> everything<00:05:50.260> ultimately<00:05:50.620> that

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
no funny and everything ultimately that

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.130 
no funny and everything ultimately that
doesn't<00:05:51.070> necessarily<00:05:51.190> add<00:05:51.730> a<00:05:52.150> lot<00:05:52.540> of<00:05:52.660> value

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:53.140 
doesn't necessarily add a lot of value

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:54.630 
doesn't necessarily add a lot of value
to<00:05:53.170> you<00:05:53.350> know<00:05:53.470> progressing<00:05:53.920> things<00:05:54.100> along<00:05:54.340> but

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:54.640 
to you know progressing things along but

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.160 
to you know progressing things along but

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:56.170
