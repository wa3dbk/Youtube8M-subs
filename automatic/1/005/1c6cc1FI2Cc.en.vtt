I'm<00:00:18.170> going<00:00:18.380> to<00:00:19.010> do<00:00:19.130> some<00:00:19.280> variation<00:00:28.420> I've

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
I'm going to do some variation I've

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.940 
I'm going to do some variation I've
actually<00:00:29.600> been<00:00:29.780> a<00:00:29.990> on<00:00:30.140> dr<00:00:30.650> from<00:00:30.830> the

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:30.950 
actually been a on dr from the

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:40.180 
actually been a on dr from the
implementation<00:00:38.800> let's<00:00:39.800> try<00:00:39.950> and<00:00:40.040> get<00:00:40.129> this

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
implementation let's try and get this

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.080 
implementation let's try and get this
descending<00:00:40.910> part<00:00:41.120> to<00:00:41.239> be<00:00:41.360> real<00:00:43.090> vocal

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
descending part to be real vocal

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:54.910 
descending part to be real vocal
sounding<00:00:44.629> real<00:00:44.780> natural<00:00:45.080> sounding<00:00:53.680> one<00:00:54.680> so

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
sounding real natural sounding one so

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.619 
sounding real natural sounding one so
when<00:00:55.070> we<00:00:55.190> descend<00:00:55.699> the<00:00:55.940> been<00:00:56.269> a<00:00:58.629> singer

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
when we descend the been a singer

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.850 
when we descend the been a singer
wouldn't<00:01:00.080> usually<00:01:00.409> change<00:01:01.100> the<00:01:01.550> speed<00:01:01.940> of<00:01:02.860> the

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
wouldn't usually change the speed of the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.460 
wouldn't usually change the speed of the

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
glissando of the slide in the middle so

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.340 
glissando of the slide in the middle so
once<00:01:06.740> the<00:01:06.920> movement<00:01:07.400> begins<00:01:08.210> to<00:01:08.450> happen<00:01:08.630> I

once the movement begins to happen I

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
to start out slow and then get faster to

the D and the device you d what we're

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.880 
the D and the device you d what we're
really<00:01:25.610> doing<00:01:25.850> is<00:01:26.210> we're<00:01:26.870> implying<00:01:27.290> a<00:01:27.620> move

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
really doing is we're implying a move

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.370

from<00:01:28.850> e<00:01:29.090> to<00:01:29.420> d<00:01:29.600> but<00:01:29.750> that<00:01:29.870> doesn't<00:01:30.140> never

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
from e to d but that doesn't never

from e to d but that doesn't never
really<00:01:30.620> happens<00:01:31.010> the<00:01:31.430> move<00:01:31.640> only<00:01:31.880> happens

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
really happens the move only happens

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.100 
really happens the move only happens
from<00:01:32.660> e<00:01:32.840> to<00:01:33.650> e<00:01:33.680> flat<00:01:34.330> and<00:01:35.330> we<00:01:35.420> pull<00:01:35.660> off<00:01:35.810> to<00:01:35.960> D<00:01:36.080> to

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
from e to e flat and we pull off to D to

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.970 
from e to e flat and we pull off to D to
imply<00:01:36.770> the<00:01:37.400> rest<00:01:37.670> of<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:37.970> Masonic<00:01:38.890> little<00:01:39.890> bit

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980 
imply the rest of the Masonic little bit

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.520 
imply the rest of the Masonic little bit
because<00:01:40.070> we<00:01:40.220> can<00:01:40.310> only<00:01:40.400> do<00:01:40.580> half<00:01:40.880> using<00:01:41.780> using

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
because we can only do half using using

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.500 
because we can only do half using using
this<00:01:42.770> pitch<00:01:43.010> only<00:01:43.640> do<00:01:43.730> half<00:01:43.910> of<00:01:44.060> what<00:01:44.120> a<00:01:44.240> singer

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
this pitch only do half of what a singer

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.570 
this pitch only do half of what a singer
would<00:01:44.600> do<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:44.990> singer<00:01:45.200> would<00:01:45.290> really<00:01:45.500> do<00:01:45.650> it

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.340 

just<00:01:49.580> go<00:01:49.730> a<00:01:49.760> straight<00:01:50.090> line<00:01:50.240> but<00:01:50.930> this<00:01:51.110> sounds

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
just go a straight line but this sounds

00:01:51.350 --> 00:02:00.460 
just go a straight line but this sounds
better<00:01:58.720> just<00:01:59.720> by<00:01:59.930> the<00:01:59.990> time<00:02:00.140> you<00:02:00.260> today

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
better just by the time you today

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.650 
better just by the time you today
there's<00:02:00.650> no<00:02:00.740> life<00:02:00.920> left<00:02:01.180> there's<00:02:02.180> no<00:02:02.270> balls<00:02:02.510> at

there's no life left there's no balls at

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:23.020 
there's no life left there's no balls at
the<00:02:02.750> internet<00:02:09.580> anyone<00:02:10.580> try<00:02:11.390> that<00:02:11.540> again<00:02:22.030> so

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
the internet anyone try that again so

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:33.070 
the internet anyone try that again so
let's<00:02:23.209> try<00:02:31.420> did<00:02:32.420> you<00:02:32.569> a<00:02:32.600> difference<00:02:32.990> between

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
let's try did you a difference between

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.140 
let's try did you a difference between
two<00:02:33.410> athletic<00:02:33.770> yes<00:02:34.040> I<00:02:34.190> did<00:02:34.370> what<00:02:34.850> was<00:02:34.970> the

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
two athletic yes I did what was the

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:44.320 
two athletic yes I did what was the
difference<00:02:40.480> probably<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:42.069> big<00:02:43.069> tech<00:02:43.400> came

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
difference probably the big tech came

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.860 
difference probably the big tech came
when<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.350> note<00:02:45.860> was<00:02:46.190> already<00:02:46.670> been<00:02:46.870> right

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
when the note was already been right

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.980 
when the note was already been right
yeah<00:02:48.860> I<00:02:48.890> my<00:02:49.430> bends<00:02:49.940> up<00:02:50.090> you<00:02:50.300> meant<00:02:50.480> up<00:02:50.630> my<00:02:50.780> bent

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
yeah I my bends up you meant up my bent

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.680 
yeah I my bends up you meant up my bent
down<00:02:51.170> yeah<00:02:51.500> at<00:02:51.680> least<00:02:51.800> I'm<00:02:53.860> just<00:02:54.860> like<00:02:54.980> anymore

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
down yeah at least I'm just like anymore

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.870 
down yeah at least I'm just like anymore
yeah<00:02:56.690> does<00:02:57.500> it<00:02:57.620> all<00:02:57.740> the<00:02:57.770> time<00:02:57.980> all<00:02:58.490> the<00:02:58.550> time

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
yeah does it all the time all the time

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.390 
yeah does it all the time all the time
and<00:02:59.650> he'll<00:03:00.650> often<00:03:01.780> alternate<00:03:02.950> he'll<00:03:03.950> do<00:03:04.100> a<00:03:04.130> lot

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
and he'll often alternate he'll do a lot

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.449 
and he'll often alternate he'll do a lot
of<00:03:04.430> those<00:03:05.319> descending<00:03:06.319> bends<00:03:06.680> see<00:03:07.130> something

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
of those descending bends see something

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.280 
of those descending bends see something
bands<00:03:07.670> decent<00:03:08.120> invent<00:03:08.420> and<00:03:08.780> then<00:03:09.020> at<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:09.200> end

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
bands decent invent and then at the end

will been off feed on the same page on

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.260 
will been off feed on the same page on
another<00:03:11.390> pitch<00:03:11.660> and<00:03:11.870> now<00:03:12.290> that<00:03:12.470> upward

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
another pitch and now that upward

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.240 
another pitch and now that upward
bending<00:03:14.270> note<00:03:14.450> is<00:03:14.630> very<00:03:14.900> very<00:03:15.230> strong<00:03:15.650> it's

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
bending note is very very strong it's

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.800 
bending note is very very strong it's
much<00:03:16.459> more<00:03:16.640> powerful<00:03:16.970> than<00:03:17.150> if<00:03:17.270> you<00:03:17.390> hit<00:03:17.569> all

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
much more powerful than if you hit all

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.059 
much more powerful than if you hit all
of<00:03:18.110> them<00:03:18.980> Gary<00:03:19.430> more<00:03:19.670> for<00:03:20.630> phrasing<00:03:21.470> is<00:03:21.560> really
