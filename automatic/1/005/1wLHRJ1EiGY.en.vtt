00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.910
 billions of neurons flutter 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.500
 in this little head of yours practically 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.230
 all the nerve cells that 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.199
 You will need your brain during 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.670
 childhood will look for other neurons 

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:16.940
 engaging more connections with each new 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.940
 experience 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.890
 with every connection the mind and the body 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.100
 will merge to form the thing that 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:33.590
 are us and in command the center of 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.590
 most exceptional operations in the world 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.990
 every system of the body is complex but 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.350
 there is only one that presides over everything 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.350
 we make 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.950
 every second since our 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.440
 day our guiding brain watches and gives 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.740
 orders defining what we are or more 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.740
 No less 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.280
 through an information highway 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.320
 made of nerves that expand by 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.850
 our body our brain is going 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.970
 taking into account each part of 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:14.180
 us eyes and ears skin and bones 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.940
 heart and muscles through 100 thousand 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.799
 millions of specialized cells 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.740
 called neurons transmitting millions 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:24.409
 of electrical and chemical signals to 320 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.090
 kilometers per hour these spots of 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.000
 less than a kilo and a half of fat and water 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.950
 they allow us to think to feel like 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.030
 remember and react 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.740
 and that's what really makes us more 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.659
 it encompasses everything from our ability 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.210
 to paint something beautiful to build 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.420
 a building act violently against 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.789
 someone who will transplant your heart for 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.759
 example will remain you but if I do 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:53.549
 something that damages your brain your character you 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:57.000
 personality can change well this is 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.039
 the brain is you and when this organ 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.140
 apparently normal and current suffers 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.130
 an aggression everything that defines you is 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.380
 in danger 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.390
 neuroscientists have a 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.670
 exceptional opportunity to observe the 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.410
 inside the blood vessels of the 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.370
 guy and take a look at the 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.500
 mysterious organ in action 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.390
 examine the human brain is the saint 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.190
 grail we all want to do it we want 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.110
 create a map where we know what 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.390
 structures there where where is the function 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.250
 of those structures but unlike 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.920
 from the map of the earth where there is a 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.500
 latitude and a longitude and those things the 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.659
 human brain is individualized each 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.140
 one is different from the rest is what we 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:36.140
 makes unique
