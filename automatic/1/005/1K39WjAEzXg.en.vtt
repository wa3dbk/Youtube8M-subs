00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.220
Hi, how are you doing?! My name is OtÃ¡rio (Sucker)!

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.210
And this is the "Recheadinho Goiabinha Bauducco"!

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.220
Wooooowww that's coooollllll!

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.010
Does Bauducco finally made a product that does not deceive the consumer?!

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.170
Let's take a look?!

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.170
This is the packaging of the "Recheadinho Goiabinha Bauducco" ...

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.290
Take a look at the shape of the biscuit ... the texture ... the size of the filling ...

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.100
Now, take a look at the reality!

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.030
So? Do I need to say something?!

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.060
Do you know why Paunuccu (Pain in the Ass) and other food companies do these things with consumers?

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.030
Basically, because they know that the brazilian consumers accept any shit without complaining!

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.190
But the main reason is because the law allows them to use "illustrative picture"!

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.090
That is, they can sell you shit and put the image on the packaging as if it was chocolate ice cream!

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.060
And s@#$%&amp; you!

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.120
Well, well ... [Sigh]

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.080
There is a bill pending since 2010,

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.110
That forbid the use of the term "illustrative image"!

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.200
And in 2012, it was added to the original text that it would be tantamount to disseminating misleading advertising.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.090
But why this bill is taking so much time to become a law?!

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.080
Is it because our competent and honorable MPs are very busy with work?!

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.240
Or is it because they have low wages?!

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.220
Because when they want increase their salaries these SoB are fast!

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.240
And in the dark of night, they promote special voting ... (as extremely urgent)

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.260
But to approve laws that benefit consumers, they leave as processing appeal: "priority"!

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.280
And "priority" means absolutely nothing!

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.250
There are 4 types of processing appeals:

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.100
"Ordinary", that is, it will take a lifetime!

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.060
"Priority", which is the same to say: it will take years!

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.190
"Urgent" ... and the already established by custom: extremely urgent

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.170
Which is used mainly when they want to increase their own salaries!

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.110
So?! You know how you can change that!

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.060
In the description of this video, there is a link to the congress and the senate's webpage...

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.060
Containing the e-mail and phone number of all deputies and senators!

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.110
Send email to each of these SoB ...

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.270
Asking them why it take so much time for a bill to turns into a law!

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.150
Call them!

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.220
Let's put these motherfuckers to work!

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.200
Or, as they are very fast to increase their salaries ...

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.170
They will be very quick to censor this video?!

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.090
After all, there is no problem to fuck the population with public money!

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.110
But swearing or cursing a politician or calling them motherfuckers, it's bad, it is immoral, it's no allowed!

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.230
Go to the Hell with your morals!

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.230
Wake up!

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.190
[Do not buy]

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.220
And signing Avaaz petitions means nothing, because this does not change anything!

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.010
Let's attack the source of the problem ...

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.090
And the main thing is, to learn to vote!

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.120
Because after you vote ... it'll be harder to fix it!

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.270
Did you like the video? So Like it! Favorite the video! Help sharing the video!

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.180
We need to get more people involved on this ...

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.130
Calling, emailing and pressing this f@#$%&amp;

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.260
To get faster results ...

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.240
But, if you got offended by the profanities or bad words I did!

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.030
Go f@#$%&amp; yourself! Because I'm sick to be fooled by those m@#$%&amp; ...

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.250
while some people are more concerned about the words that I use!

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.240
[Hunf]
