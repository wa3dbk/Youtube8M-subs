00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
everywhere so obviously you know if she

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.660 
everywhere so obviously you know if she
tried<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:48.989> scan<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.829> put<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.430> bag

kind of that old cliche it depends on

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.950
