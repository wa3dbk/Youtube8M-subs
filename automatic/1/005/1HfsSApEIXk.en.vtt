00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.410
 game assassin's creed 4 black flag and me 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.670
 I wanted to show so much for you 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.980
 In this game I 'm going to start showing a 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.900
 little of the underwater exploration I 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.400
 I found one of the best balconies in the game and 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.589
 I really liked it 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.560
 I thought it was a novelty in the game. 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:28.199
 yes that gives you that will of you 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.929
 Explore from you how it goes 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.360
 This is what happens in the game, right? 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.070
 exposing your banks that is you are 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.720
 sailing through the dead seven centuries 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.790
 the game map of the seas that says is 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.760
 very large passage you will find 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.170
 some ships just with the tip out 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.970
 the wrecks, right? 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.710
 only with the course of the game in the beginning you 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.840
 can not get it out further ahead 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.880
 You'll evolve in the game, you'll get one. 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.980
 upgrade that the ship called the bell of 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.750
 diving and only with him will you 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.630
 able to access these places as 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.210
 in these places have what the chests have 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.970
 where will you be able to find the treasures 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.890
 has fragments of the bus and also has 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.170
 professional bird improvement plans where 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.240
 you will pick up as well some some 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.499
 upgrades only possible through these 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.509
 plans right 

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:15.479
 and it's very interesting his chart is 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:17.159
 It's really cool to fight ours is a 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.960
 different thing that saw no game 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.780
 assassin's creed o soft has placed in this 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.509
 suits the universe of the game that 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.789
 passes in the age of piracy where 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.619
 naval battles so epic right 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:30.359
 the wrecks that happens interesting 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.079
 you explore the universe well 

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:36.030
 interesting what are you exploring? 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.659
 the game itself is not an achievement anymore 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.189
 for you to play and you can see 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.649
 by the video you dive into is that 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.780
 comet no but in the middle of the map 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.670
 submarine has some oxygen drums 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.549
 and your crew plays where you 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.109
 recharges your breath right then 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.840
 so you can explore 

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:57.060
 correctly the whole map can see that the 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.819
 chests too and do not think it's easy and 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.100
 has several expert sharks have moray eels 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:03.840
 that attack you have the spines of the sea 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.789
 Where are you going to get hurt on the ship? 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.770
 so then you have to take enough 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.179
 care will not only respond with the 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.730
 Sharks attack me every hour in the game 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.150
 here I do not know if I'll get further ahead 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.829
 an 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.010
 How do you use underwater? 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:19.200
 to be able to defend the animals more 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.090
 for now it is taking a beautiful 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.670
 indac bites in the game, right? 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.560
 it's very cool, very cute 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.549
 game, let alone 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.590
 reminding you that it is available for 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:31.260
 various platforms 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.340
 in the recorded video recording in the xbox one year 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.840
 but it is also available for xbox 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.970
 360 playstation 3 pc playstation 4 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.010
 also and the xbox but I do not know if we have 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.730
 any platform that has the black flag 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.099
 huh 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.379
 but it's a really cool game, it 's interesting 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:48.599
 that you play with small and 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:51.120
 Who I like these 33 knows he is 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:53.099
 or the choice of history but this 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.019
 asks if it is so 10 how it is that 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:56.819
 The story of the game is fine 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.340
 I tell you, they look really cool. 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.930
 with very interesting new gas in the 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.810
 story in the universe of assassin's creed 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.579
 did not leave a little of that thematic house 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.019
 of the tenth more so 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:08.700
 but it's a really cool game but it 's a 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.590
 Subject is the one we're showing talking 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.069
 because I respect you exploration 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.319
 underwater I found 11 which is one more 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.180
 name to be an extra attraction in the game right? 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.859
 besides it is clear from the fantastic story 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.560
 turn fantastic 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:24.480
 missions on the islands so you have to 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.699
 complete has the fighting 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.010
 is the maritime has the naval battles 

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:31.199
 also that another very cool part 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.159
 well done also in the next video back 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:34.859
 to show you some of the 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:36.389
 naval battles of the game and how they have 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:39.060
 So much good in this game I'll try 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:40.319
 divided into three 3-4 to video 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.000
 show you in this first video 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.579
 that shows a little and talk to 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.199
 respect of underwater explorations 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.519
 I think it's very cool that it's very 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:48.930
 interesting to show you here 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.090
 talk a little about it 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.699
 in the next video I'll show you a little 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.829
 naval battles after a bit of 

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:57.299
 history for you is also and in the last 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.250
 video shows a bit of multiplayer that 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.530
 is also present in the areas where the 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.879
 black flag why I have not played it yet 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.010
 trying to finalize the campaign for 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.569
 then venturing into multiplayer is the 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.000
 I always like to do now 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:11.159
 first day to complete the campaign to 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.169
 then it 's playing a multiplayer and this 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:16.109
 no matter what 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:18.510
 He criticized the city at last what it is and 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.060
 People also ask if I'm going to stop. 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.380
 to make xbox 360 videos that I'm 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.450
 doing here because it 's the game that I 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.650
 I have in xbox or did not want to show 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.450
 I would bring you with a quality one 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.550
 a little better audio and 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.260
 video is no more than it does a 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.030
 xbox video can also 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.340
 stay quiet, huh? 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.870
 but with 25 videos of the game assassin's 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.190
 creed black flag that a little bit more 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.690
 for you regarding the exploitation 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.850
 underwater I hope you have 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.800
 liked the video anything comments 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.190
 discuss at the end of the game player and 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.000
 next 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.000
 we talked
