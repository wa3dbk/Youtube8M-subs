00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.760
 unique example 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.390
 I give you to connect bands as you can 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.110

 good 2009 this is gray so I give to 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:39.079
 connect and the most enjoyable thing that is not 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:39.079
 anything like that 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.060
 you put it in the prizes back like this and 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.760
 it gets like this but disconnect like that 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.510
 nothing happens 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:52.330
 well this is something that happens a lot and it is 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.420
 very easy if for example they felix 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.650
 chosen to pass this they stuck it there are many 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.560
 people who of the 8 for being the best 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:03.520
 I said I was worth and better what they are going to 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.439
 do so that this ends this here is 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.250
 while a poster says a poster 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:12.180
 that says open installation folder 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:15.360

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:19.140
 good pointed minecraft and what with this 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.120
 is not to lie and copy this folder to

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.349
 villeta 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.980
 once you have copied glass the 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.019
 desktop or services already finished 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.489

 their versions dance again and good 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.860
 as you can see 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:54.670
 the folder would be completely empty 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:57.360
 I really would not be there and good now 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.360

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:16.280
 and good how to go back to everything 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.280

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.610
 I do not know I think the 97 retired but not 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.640
 I would buy it because pity is the script 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.890
 now I would buy because I do not know why 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.930
 it exists here and it is the same some norm of 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.709
 minecraft perez good is going again 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.720
 open the installation folder 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.400
 and well well here says versions will be 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.980
 Minecraft versions that you had 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:44.410
 downloaded and they will be inside this 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.410
 folder here in version 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:51.180
 some props here highlights out 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:53.760
 I would be here inside and it would be a serious folder 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.370
 what he does with this tablet that I feel 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.689
 I would be a variety to refresh the 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:02.430
 outer folder 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:05.909
 inside 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:10.019
 they have other things fort kits 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:13.769
 of ski of the boarding the statutes 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:16.769
 open good is said version copy 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:20.959
 all this is cut by the Serbs and what 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:23.120
 ensure version goes back 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:26.870
 and well that would be already if you want to copy 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:30.770
 the modules with something else if I gave in the 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.720
 forum installed with the version folder already 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.069
 will be the force so you can move 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.840
 the modes if you want I also wanted 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:39.040
 return 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:43.920
 yes it is 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.920
 Well, nothing else, we do 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.930
 good these things 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:56.210
 if you miss holes like that 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:58.520
 to open this and open it and it does not appear 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.800
 and does not have some of these things copy 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.440
 of the folder in this folder that we have 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.500
 past list 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:08.310
 good to close the congress this for 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.880
 open up is this the author 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:14.800
 then we give 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:17.800
 well once finished this works 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.800
 all right 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.340
 vegetable 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:30.370
 and good here when I'm loading I'm fine 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.229
 to do current is to say that if you go to 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.090
 say but it's you threw me the time to 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:36.539
 bring the version to the installation to 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:40.210
 the version and bring all at once 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:41.770
 analyze games I already did download and good 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.990
 if not some other visible problem the 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:46.410
 comments 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:49.030
 the video that I'm in right now, you have to 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:51.500
 download it but you give new folders 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.900
 that were there 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:59.200
 as you can see here they have been seen 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:06:04.540
 for example asÃ­s assist libraries 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:07.800
 racist sexist racists 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:09.360
 and good and all things like dancing 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.759
 once you put this civil did 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.720
 downloads to move on to something else by 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:14.720
 example is now being downloaded 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.820
