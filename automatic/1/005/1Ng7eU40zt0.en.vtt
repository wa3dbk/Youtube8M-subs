00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.190
 so I'm going to give you a review of 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:12.250
 products on a varnish corrector of 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:22.090
 at sephora so it looks like 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:24.640
 this you see you have you have a 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.770
 beveled tip in fact that allows you 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.910
 to clean the contours long 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:33.760
 so in fact there are two reloads for 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:37.710
 replace once the role that 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.600
 the other mines will be halls and so 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.370
 so here I am going to apply my vernier 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.569
 in fact mostly nails and then I 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.679
 will come back to use the pen 

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:50.949
 so here is the first layer I have 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:53.309
 applied a little to rabies but especially 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:53.309
 on the left hand 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:01:04.390
 so here I am overwhelmed everywhere and I 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:07.120
 am going to use pens so so then 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:12.070
 I do I do it like that you do 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:13.990
 start on the side here I go in 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:21.340
 underneath there and we are certainly not 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:23.880
 of warheads the edge of the shadow which has 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.880
 had to scream on it 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:41.160
 b even make it actually the 2d underneath 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.160
 cuticles actually with the slice of the 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:48.930
 slice of the pen went well below 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:52.250
 and so you can redraw the 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.250
 outline of your nail polish actually 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:12.050
 here is the edge too so that's good 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.050
 handy the edge handed over to the tel 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.840
 so here it is like this 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.599
 of course I let them clean 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:37.129
 at the end of the first layer but you 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.189
 can obviously wait for the second 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:41.599
 layer to clean everything seen as seen 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:43.579
 as being a second layer ago 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:47.110
 risks that happy to exceed 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:50.390
 as much to do it once in the end that 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:57.650
 that there so that's how is the tip 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:59.859
 in the end I have just tried to 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.150
 remove 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:07.519
 so here you will have to shoot as 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:09.049
 it's actually inside like that but 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:14.450
 good maybe that has these refills 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:16.549
 that it can be recharged but good 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:23.319
 I will try when I when there will be 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:28.359
 more dissolving in so that's the 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.359
 the product 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.780
 here 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.689
 I hope that this interview you 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:45.180
 will have pleased and do not hesitate to leave 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:45.750
 comments to subscribe and to a 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.939
 but the video 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.209
 so I go back one last time the 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:53.659
 result so I will put pictures to the 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:59.090
 end I will try to put pictures 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:59.090
 so here you can clean up 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:06.230
 really good what's left nothing 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:06.230
 so it's really a practical tool 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.849
 here 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.849
 see you soon
