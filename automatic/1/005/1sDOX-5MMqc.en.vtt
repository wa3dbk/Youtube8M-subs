more stretch oh yeah I should take this
on<00:06:16.980> a<00:06:17.010> drag<00:06:17.310> strip

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:07:04.909 

again<00:06:32.050> turbo<00:06:33.039> on<00:06:33.220> the<00:06:33.310> door<00:06:33.580> handle

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:04.919 

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:07.350 

now<00:07:05.919> all<00:07:06.100> par<00:07:06.370> states<00:07:06.729> that<00:07:06.970> the<00:07:07.150> drag
