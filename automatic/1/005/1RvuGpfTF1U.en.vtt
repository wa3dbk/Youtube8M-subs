00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 today we have the visit in the news 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.190
 by bmx at kingdom hearts 3 report 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.440
 about us being in mass effect 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.389
 andromeda no known faces too 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.580
 see you and tell you who the 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.559
 director for star wars episode 9 is 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.150
 I am a lot of love and these are the tags 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:20.250
 caliber news fans of kingdom hearts and 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.920
 of the cuddly b-max, there are good ones 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.570
 news at the d23 expo announced 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.180
 namely now producer shinji hashimoto 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.550
 that the doctor robots in kingdom hearts 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.410
 will emerge and not only that 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.210
 complete world of the mix is supposed to be in 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.730
 the third part of the game 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.070
 entrance tokio just fits perfectly 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.540
 The producer has to sound like that then 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.399
 should look after the world 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.079
 events from the film settled 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.059
 it should be thematically about friendship 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.950
 and the victory of the light against the 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.289
 darkness went down during the press 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.390
 there is already a picture of sora on bmx 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.190
 back to see it was info but 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.899
 then maybe even for the end 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.660
 of the year after the tokyo games show 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.550
 a little smarter 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.079
 Fans of mass effect should be fine 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.300
 time to adjust to new part 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.110
 andromeda no known faces too 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.090
 to get to see 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.160
 This pointed Siena development director 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.320
 crispin via twitter 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.540
 to the question of a fan whether the well-known 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.130
 faces would be answered 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.080
 He just missed that from the plot 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.640
 It would not make any sense whatsoever 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.410
 That would not be surprising, though 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.180
 the andromeda plays in a complete 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.910
 other galaxy than its predecessors and 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.810
 especially 100 years later 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.310
 Maybe we can 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.440
 references to the previous games 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.869
 even if known figures do not find 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.520
 emerge will be assured that the 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.710
 players will feel at home 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.759
 Andromeda is just mass effect and 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.530
 feel that way too 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.479
 By the way, the game is only for the pc 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.700
 and the cherries on the market 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.890
 a view version will probably not 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.340
 the bÃ¢lise michael gamble appears 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.500
 hinted 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.109
 no week without star wars news 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.789
 also on the d23 expo volume of 

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:54.740
 catherine kennedy of her mark 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:57.170
 president of lucasfilm confirms who 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.030
 will lead in episodes direction and the 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.219
 nobody is lesser than jurassic 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.719
 world director colin trewwerer too 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:04.429
 if the good man next to the dino 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:06.860
 adventure not much and above all 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:08.360
 only unknown staged seems 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.019
 the responsible of him convinced 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.450
 to be 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:13.730
 Let's press his thumb 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.140
 cinema start is even only 2,019 to 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.879
 He has a bit of practice there 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.130
 in the same breath was the rest 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:21.560
 also the official star wars poster of 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.790
 ustream also the old poster 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.340
 for star wars and indiana jones 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.040
 designed to look forward to seeing it 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.200
 fin ray calories and hans solo no 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.910
 trace of layer or hatch we are 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.160
 curious to what extent the action 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.900
 somehow reflects remarkably 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.790
 the poster is still finn 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.650
 laser sword in hand has thus is 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.780
 very possible that he is a jedi 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.670
 or a few tavannes what 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.950
 believe you are Luke and teacher really 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.349
 just as often suspected only 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.600
 notes in episode 7 and you will 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.489
 mass effect andromeda even without known 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.359
 faces zocken write us down 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.069
 in the comments 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:56.900
 otherwise as always up here two 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.579
 more videos down here on the left 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.350
