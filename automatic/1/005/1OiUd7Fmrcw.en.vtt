00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.460
 hashtag urban design because I am me too 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.200
 you can hear that too 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.660
 so when did your creations operate? 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.200
 especially share and harley start what i have 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.899
 you need 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.860
 hair spray or a liquid plaster spray 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.120
 an eyeliner powder and a brush 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.980
 remember before you start 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.140
 what you want to make on your hand or on 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.090
 any place, because then you know 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.199
 already soon you could do was 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.360
 I 'm still under I have my nails 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.680
 I found life lacquered in a tweet 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.869
 very nice and I am wearing the rings 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.220
 done that I want to put on later 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.369
 she doesn't have my hands or cuticle 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.049
 the most beautiful but also with less beautiful ones 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.820
 hands this is a lot of fun to do 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.100
 if you are completely ready you can 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.720
 try to draw the eyeliner draw 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.670
 until 3 you had that on you and these are the 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.170
 that's what you made 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.880
 I like to nail my nail too 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.650
 to decorate so that it belongs 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.710
 and I do this with nail polish and and tot 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.110
 now let the whole dry well and 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.299
 then we proceed to the next step 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.920
 I gently take off my rings and now 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.520
 we will make sure that it is your 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.520
 stays in place 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.329
 first by putting some powder on this that 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.780
 purpose and so they become mat and only 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.130
 more like a real thing because that's you 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.799
 good to sit I have two 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.810
 ways the first is knowing her lax 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.640
 just wonderful about this doing and that 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.250
 is our before it gets you in place 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.229
 remains this is not entirely true the test 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.909
 so if you wash your hands this is it 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.620
 we finished it but now two is with the 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.750
 band Aid 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.280
 re this way remains slightly better 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.470
 with this you can also gently hold your hands 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.390
 wash and the more thicker the layer 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.780
 patch is as it were better 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.780
 sit down 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.930
 Also let it dry thoroughly with a 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.370
 ready to go 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.050
 of course you can also in other places 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.030
 compared to that when I make my own 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.590
 wrist for example an infinity 'against 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.090
 but you can 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.770
 yes not crazy or you can do it 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.990
 I am very happy with it 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.670
 end result looks very tough but 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.050
 yet festive too so I like it 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.450
 very nice for example when I go to 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.340
 festival go this was the diy coach him 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.780
