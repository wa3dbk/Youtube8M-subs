00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
wings in flight mode there and to move

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.770 
wings in flight mode there and to move
to<00:02:18.750> attack<00:02:19.050> Mart<00:02:19.490> you<00:02:20.490> would<00:02:20.640> push<00:02:20.880> down<00:02:21.150> r2d2

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
to attack Mart you would push down r2d2

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:22.490 
to attack Mart you would push down r2d2
head

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
head

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.820 
head
now<00:02:23.430> this<00:02:23.700> one<00:02:24.120> it<00:02:24.510> was<00:02:24.600> very<00:02:24.900> temperamental

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
now this one it was very temperamental

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.610 
now this one it was very temperamental
and<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.430> see<00:02:26.640> it<00:02:26.730> just<00:02:26.910> wants<00:02:27.150> to<00:02:27.380> flop<00:02:28.380> back

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.370 
and you see it just wants to flop back
down<00:02:29.060> on<00:02:30.060> this<00:02:30.210> button<00:02:30.540> if<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:30.870> push<00:02:31.200> it

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
down on this button if you push it

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.540 
down on this button if you push it
forward<00:02:33.140> and<00:02:34.140> fight<00:02:34.860> with<00:02:35.010> it<00:02:35.160> a<00:02:35.250> little<00:02:35.370> bit

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
forward and fight with it a little bit

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.310 
forward and fight with it a little bit
eventually<00:02:36.450> there<00:02:36.690> we<00:02:36.780> go

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
eventually there we go

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.090 
eventually there we go
it<00:02:37.980> will<00:02:38.160> hold<00:02:38.430> him<00:02:38.790> position<00:02:39.740> and<00:02:40.740> to<00:02:40.920> move

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
it will hold him position and to move

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.800 
it will hold him position and to move
the<00:02:41.280> wings<00:02:41.430> back<00:02:41.670> down<00:02:41.970> you<00:02:42.330> just<00:02:42.540> flick<00:02:42.780> a

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
the wings back down you just flick a

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.380 
the wings back down you just flick a
little<00:02:43.170> button<00:02:43.380> back<00:02:44.060> and<00:02:45.060> we're<00:02:45.210> back<00:02:45.330> to
