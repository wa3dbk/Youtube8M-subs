00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
North Carolina so you see the group

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.840 
North Carolina so you see the group
behind<00:00:36.390> me<00:00:36.540> they<00:00:37.230> tell<00:00:37.410> me<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.829> group<00:00:38.670> of

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
behind me they tell me that a group of

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.000 
behind me they tell me that a group of
turkeys<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.390> sometimes<00:00:39.809> called<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.290> flock<00:00:40.710> or

I'm<00:00:43.200> from<00:00:43.469> higher<00:00:43.649> education<00:00:43.860> so<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.610> group

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
I'm from higher education so a group

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.250 
I'm from higher education so a group
like<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.059> would<00:00:45.450> actually<00:00:45.780> be<00:00:45.899> called<00:00:46.079> a

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
like that would actually be called a

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.229 
like that would actually be called a
meeting<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.710> deans<00:00:47.010> or<00:00:47.640> they<00:00:47.910> look<00:00:48.059> fairly

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
meeting of the deans or they look fairly

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.970 
meeting of the deans or they look fairly
pumped<00:00:48.719> up<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.079> they<00:00:49.170> may<00:00:49.320> actually<00:00:49.590> be<00:00:49.950> the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
pumped up and they may actually be the

cabinet<00:00:50.640> agriculture<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.780> high-value

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
cabinet agriculture is a high-value

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.760 
cabinet agriculture is a high-value
industry<00:00:53.280> in<00:00:53.550> other<00:00:53.820> words<00:00:54.090> it's<00:00:54.390> adds<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.620> lot

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
industry in other words it's adds a lot

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.590 
industry in other words it's adds a lot
of<00:00:55.829> value<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.489> it's<00:00:56.670> much<00:00:56.879> more<00:00:57.149> than<00:00:57.360> just

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
of value and it's much more than just

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.900 
of value and it's much more than just
the<00:00:57.719> value<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.170> inputs<00:00:58.710> so<00:00:59.280> we<00:00:59.430> also<00:00:59.609> see

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
the value of the inputs so we also see

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.060 
the value of the inputs so we also see
that<00:00:59.940> in<00:01:00.510> turkey<00:01:00.809> farming<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.500> exact<00:01:01.859> same

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
that in turkey farming is the exact same

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.039 
that in turkey farming is the exact same
thing<00:01:02.340> we<00:01:02.550> also<00:01:02.730> see<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.059> for<00:01:03.539> example<00:01:03.570> in<00:01:03.989> a

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
thing we also see that for example in a

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.960 
thing we also see that for example in a
greenhouse<00:01:04.379> industry<00:01:04.920> where<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.670> value<00:01:05.939> of

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
greenhouse industry where the value of

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.969 
greenhouse industry where the value of
the<00:01:06.090> inputs<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.750> nowhere<00:01:07.080> near<00:01:07.470> what<00:01:07.799> the

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
the inputs is nowhere near what the

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.429 
the inputs is nowhere near what the
value<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.490> output<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.840> when<00:01:10.320> you're

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
value of the output is so when you're

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.350 
value of the output is so when you're
calculating<00:01:10.619> an<00:01:11.070> economic<00:01:11.549> impact<00:01:11.909> what<00:01:12.210> you

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
calculating an economic impact what you

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.840 
calculating an economic impact what you
need<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.630> look<00:01:12.780> at<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.979> direct<00:01:14.369> impact

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
need to look at is the direct impact

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.330 
need to look at is the direct impact
which<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.540> value<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.500> production<00:01:17.009> of

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
which is the value of the production of

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.830 
which is the value of the production of
the<00:01:17.610> industry<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.150> you're<00:01:18.299> looking<00:01:18.540> at<00:01:18.659> in

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
the industry that you're looking at in

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.240 
the industry that you're looking at in
our<00:01:18.960> case<00:01:19.170> here<00:01:19.200> would<00:01:19.710> be<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.979> turkey

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
our case here would be the turkey

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.039 
our case here would be the turkey
production<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.240> then<00:01:21.360> you're<00:01:21.509> looking<00:01:21.780> at<00:01:21.900> an

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
production and then you're looking at an

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.109 
production and then you're looking at an
indirect<00:01:22.500> impact<00:01:22.680> which<00:01:23.580> looks<00:01:23.880> at<00:01:24.090> the

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
indirect impact which looks at the

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.060 
indirect impact which looks at the
business-to-business<00:01:25.049> purchases<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.040> a

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
business-to-business purchases that a

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.190 
business-to-business purchases that a
turkey<00:01:26.400> farm<00:01:26.610> might<00:01:26.820> do<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.299> for<00:01:27.720> example<00:01:28.080> in

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
turkey farm might do so for example in

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.480 
turkey farm might do so for example in
this<00:01:28.290> case<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.680> would<00:01:28.770> be<00:01:28.920> heavy<00:01:29.159> grain

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
this case it would be heavy grain

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.760 
this case it would be heavy grain
production<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:31.079> good<00:01:31.350> there's<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.560> lot<00:01:31.680> of

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
production so good there's a lot of

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.760 
production so good there's a lot of
grain<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:31.979> goes<00:01:32.280> in<00:01:32.460> into<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.689> feed<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.619> to

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
grain that goes in into the feed to to

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.289 
grain that goes in into the feed to to
attack<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.280> flock<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.520> turkeys<00:01:35.880> like<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.180> one

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
attack the flock of turkeys like the one

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.260 
attack the flock of turkeys like the one
behind<00:01:36.479> me<00:01:36.979> we<00:01:37.979> also<00:01:38.159> then<00:01:38.430> have<00:01:38.700> an<00:01:38.850> induced

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
behind me we also then have an induced

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.499 
behind me we also then have an induced

farmers or their employees go out and
spend<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.210> money<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:45.659> as<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.899> add<00:01:46.049> all<00:01:46.259> of

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
spend the money so as you add all of

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.080 
spend the money so as you add all of
those<00:01:46.500> three<00:01:46.829> three<00:01:47.310> components<00:01:47.820> up<00:01:47.970> the

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
direct indirect and induced you get the

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.060
