00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
for the dsi Japan because it's a game

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.810 
for the dsi Japan because it's a game
that<00:00:12.180> really<00:00:12.660> needs<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.500> be<00:00:13.620> seen<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.790> be

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
that really needs to be seen to be

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.710 
that really needs to be seen to be
properly<00:00:15.650> understood<00:00:16.730> it's<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.970> demonstration

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
properly understood it's a demonstration

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.980 
properly understood it's a demonstration
of<00:00:18.930> new<00:00:19.080> technology<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:19.950> the<00:00:20.310> form<00:00:20.580> of<00:00:20.990> video

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
of new technology and the form of video

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.170 
of new technology and the form of video
head<00:00:22.230> tracking<00:00:22.620> on<00:00:23.990> dsi<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.310> therefore<00:00:26.310> isn't

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
head tracking on dsi and therefore isn't

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.019 
head tracking on dsi and therefore isn't
really<00:00:27.810> something<00:00:28.020> that<00:00:28.430> is<00:00:29.430> contained<00:00:29.880> as

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
really something that is contained as

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.809 
really something that is contained as
well<00:00:30.210> yeah<00:00:30.660> text<00:00:31.650> because<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.489> uses<00:00:32.669> the

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:32.819 
well yeah text because it uses the

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:36.669 
well yeah text because it uses the
camera<00:00:33.409> you<00:00:34.409> do<00:00:34.769> have<00:00:35.069> to<00:00:35.460> do<00:00:35.730> this

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:36.679 
camera you do have to do this

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:39.410 
camera you do have to do this
calibration<00:00:37.679> thing<00:00:37.890> every<00:00:38.579> time<00:00:38.609> you<00:00:39.239> play

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
calibration thing every time you play

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.840 
calibration thing every time you play
and<00:00:39.839> it's<00:00:40.679> important<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.190> note<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.399> the

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
and it's important to note that the

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.849 
and it's important to note that the
lighting<00:00:42.210> conditions<00:00:42.719> are<00:00:42.870> rather<00:00:43.079> important

00:00:43.849 --> 00:00:43.859 
lighting conditions are rather important

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:48.860 
lighting conditions are rather important
if<00:00:44.460> it's<00:00:44.699> low<00:00:44.940> light<00:00:45.379> then<00:00:47.449> as<00:00:48.449> you<00:00:48.629> can<00:00:48.749> see

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
if it's low light then as you can see

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.569 
if it's low light then as you can see
here<00:00:49.079> it's<00:00:49.229> it's<00:00:49.499> highlighting<00:00:50.039> this<00:00:50.159> is<00:00:50.370> the

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
here it's it's highlighting this is the

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.169 
here it's it's highlighting this is the
facial<00:00:50.999> recognition<00:00:51.179> part<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.109> the<00:00:52.319> orange<00:00:52.769> is

00:00:53.169 --> 00:00:53.179 
facial recognition part so the orange is

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:56.419 
facial recognition part so the orange is
my<00:00:54.179> face<00:00:55.019> and<00:00:55.350> there's<00:00:55.469> examples<00:00:55.799> on<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.219> side

00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:56.429 
my face and there's examples on the side

00:00:56.429 --> 00:01:00.829 
my face and there's examples on the side
of<00:00:56.670> what<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:57.079> good<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.319> what<00:00:58.409> is<00:00:58.979> bad<00:00:59.629> now<00:01:00.629> this

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:00.839 
of what is good and what is bad now this

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:02.299 
of what is good and what is bad now this
is<00:01:00.959> the<00:01:00.989> very<00:01:01.170> first<00:01:01.409> level<00:01:01.739> as<00:01:01.889> you<00:01:02.039> can<00:01:02.129> see

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
is the very first level as you can see

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.450 
is the very first level as you can see
I've<00:01:02.399> already<00:01:02.579> found<00:01:02.940> all<00:01:03.659> three<00:01:04.019> letters

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
I've already found all three letters

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.310 
I've already found all three letters
some<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.579> the<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:06.390> letters<00:01:06.689> appear<00:01:06.869> in<00:01:07.229> the

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
some of the the letters appear in the

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.889 
some of the the letters appear in the
same<00:01:07.530> font<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.789> there's<00:01:08.969> a<00:01:09.030> bit<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.240> tilting<00:01:09.689> so

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
same font so there's a bit of tilting so

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:13.730 
same font so there's a bit of tilting so
you<00:01:09.990> can<00:01:10.140> see<00:01:10.289> like<00:01:10.469> the<00:01:10.649> S<00:01:11.000> is<00:01:12.380> here<00:01:13.380> at<00:01:13.560> least

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
you can see like the S is here at least

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.760 
you can see like the S is here at least
I<00:01:13.829> hope<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.070> can<00:01:14.250> see<00:01:14.750> and<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:16.380> move<00:01:16.590> the

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
I hope you can see and you move the

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
d-pad and then you click on the bang and

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.069 
d-pad and then you click on the bang and
the<00:01:22.439> corner<00:01:22.799> here<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.219> tell<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.090> oh<00:01:24.299> yes<00:01:24.960> I

you rather tricky and you see over here

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.590 
you rather tricky and you see over here
when<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.320> first<00:01:37.530> starts<00:01:37.799> out<00:01:38.240> you<00:01:39.240> just<00:01:39.479> have<00:01:39.570> a

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
when it first starts out you just have a

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.999 
when it first starts out you just have a
static<00:01:39.990> image<00:01:40.079> there's<00:01:40.380> nothing<00:01:40.619> happening

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
static image there's nothing happening

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.289 
static image there's nothing happening
and<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.250> just<00:01:41.369> find<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.640> three<00:01:41.820> letters<00:01:42.090> is

and you just find the three letters is
your<00:01:42.450> initial<00:01:42.780> tutorial<00:01:43.439> but<00:01:43.979> then<00:01:44.280> you're

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
your initial tutorial but then you're
