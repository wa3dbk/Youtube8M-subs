00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.060
 Android mobile device only 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.060
 you will need to install an application and 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.350
 follow some steps we go directly 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.970
 Well first let's see that I do not have the 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.710
 keyboard now let's install it and 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.330
 configure it so that you have it 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.300
 on their mobile 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.070
 let's go to our portfolio of our 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.869
 files our other files we can 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.030
 use in the default application of 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.680
 your mobile or you can use explorer that 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.300
 same is a very good file manager 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.240
 let's go to my memory card and let's 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.490
 install this application that you see here I 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.720
 I already have it installed if I install it 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.790
 again it may appear error 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.560
 or maybe install normally we can 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.479
 wait for a little bit to install the 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.550
 application is called iphone 6 keyboard 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.400
 let's see the open button and 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.690
 directly will take us to this setup or 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.690
 configuration as he wants to call 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.170
 where first we will enable the 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.220
 keyboard pressing on network gable and 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.380
 we mark with the popcorn 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.180
 so that iphone shake keyboard is 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.280
 enabled on our mobile we go back 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.260
 and it tells us that we choose by default the 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.440
 keyboard in this case I had the 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.150
 samsung keyboard as default but in 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.730
 this case I will install and I will place 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.860
 the iphone 6 once done this we do not go 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.600
 to the back button and let's go to 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.910
 our application drawer where 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.560
 we will look for example the notes for 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.990
 to show them that we already have the 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.060
 iphone 6 and 28 keyboard in your 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.710
 Android mobile device easily 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.800
 as you will see we have no difficulty 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.780
 to write any kind of word in 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.880
 our mobile we see that we go to our 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.090
 portal of the numbers the truth has 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.500
 a great graphic and good very 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.390
 detailed and very light is that it does not weigh 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.670
 a lot too and well if you see there 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.040

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.050
