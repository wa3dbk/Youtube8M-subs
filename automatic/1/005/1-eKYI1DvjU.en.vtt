00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
less because that's a budget phone now I

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.000 
less because that's a budget phone now I
was<00:03:58.060> saying<00:03:58.270> a<00:03:58.420> man<00:03:59.200> picks<00:03:59.470> on<00:03:59.560> the<00:03:59.590> back<00:03:59.800> and

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
was saying a man picks on the back and

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.220 
was saying a man picks on the back and
five<00:04:00.250> on<00:04:00.459> the<00:04:00.520> front<00:04:00.820> it<00:04:01.000> doesn't<00:04:01.180> HDR<00:04:01.900> no

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.800 
optical image stabilization or anything
like<00:04:03.550> this<00:04:03.670> one<00:04:03.820> but<00:04:03.970> it<00:04:04.060> is<00:04:04.330> considered<00:04:04.660> a

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
like this one but it is considered a

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.140 
like this one but it is considered a
budget<00:04:05.140> but<00:04:05.590> it<00:04:05.709> does<00:04:05.950> have<00:04:06.190> dual<00:04:06.459> band<00:04:06.850> Wi-Fi

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
budget but it does have dual band Wi-Fi

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.930 
budget but it does have dual band Wi-Fi
which<00:04:07.630> is<00:04:07.750> a<00:04:07.780> huge<00:04:08.050> plus<00:04:08.520> and<00:04:09.520> I<00:04:09.550> believe<00:04:09.760> all

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
which is a huge plus and I believe all

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.790 
which is a huge plus and I believe all
of<00:04:09.970> these<00:04:10.090> devices<00:04:10.390> are<00:04:10.570> curved<00:04:11.050> that's<00:04:11.650> the

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
of these devices are curved that's the

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.130 
of these devices are curved that's the
funny<00:04:12.370> part<00:04:12.459> I'll<00:04:12.730> go<00:04:12.820> back<00:04:12.940> to<00:04:13.090> the<00:04:13.239> to<00:04:14.020> the

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
funny part I'll go back to the to the

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.530 
funny part I'll go back to the to the

front-facing camera is probably a VGA

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.450 
front-facing camera is probably a VGA
camera<00:05:40.140> because<00:05:40.590> there<00:05:40.770> it<00:05:41.070> just<00:05:41.280> says

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
camera because there it just says

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.760 
camera because there it just says
front-facing<00:05:42.180> camera<00:05:42.660> but<00:05:43.200> it<00:05:43.289> does<00:05:43.440> Schiphol

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
front-facing camera but it does Schiphol

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.100 
front-facing camera but it does Schiphol
if<00:05:43.860> I<00:05:43.950> point<00:05:44.160> out<00:05:44.280> this<00:05:45.150> LTE<00:05:45.570> for<00:05:45.960> t-mobile

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
if I point out this LTE for t-mobile

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.150 
if I point out this LTE for t-mobile
which<00:05:46.500> is<00:05:46.650> great<00:05:47.750> Wi-Fi<00:05:48.750> calling<00:05:49.160> everything

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
which is great Wi-Fi calling everything

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.650 
which is great Wi-Fi calling everything
so<00:05:50.550> let's<00:05:50.669> go<00:05:50.760> over<00:05:50.880> to<00:05:50.970> the<00:05:51.060> spec<00:05:51.330> sheet<00:05:53.660> and

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:54.660 
so let's go over to the spec sheet and

00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:00.650 
so let's go over to the spec sheet and
let's<00:05:54.870> see<00:05:55.020> what<00:05:55.140> this<00:05:55.260> one<00:05:55.320> says<00:05:55.710> here<00:05:59.419> and<00:06:00.419> it

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 
let's see what this one says here and it

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.030 
let's see what this one says here and it
is<00:06:00.750> right<00:06:00.990> here

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:05.040 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.640 

for<00:06:06.040> many<00:06:06.190> different<00:06:06.490> names<00:06:06.640> you<00:06:06.940> see<00:06:07.560> so<00:06:08.560> this

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:08.650 
for many different names you see so this

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.440 
for many different names you see so this
one<00:06:08.800> is<00:06:08.920> actually<00:06:09.040> 140<00:06:09.790> grams<00:06:10.000> it's<00:06:10.240> a<00:06:10.300> much

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:10.450 
one is actually 140 grams it's a much

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.800 
one is actually 140 grams it's a much
lighter

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:10.810 
lighter

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.530 
lighter
10<00:06:11.320> millimeters<00:06:11.740> in<00:06:11.860> thickness<00:06:12.240> this<00:06:13.240> one<00:06:13.360> has

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:13.540 
10 millimeters in thickness this one has

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:17.370 
10 millimeters in thickness this one has
a<00:06:13.810> much<00:06:14.530> lower<00:06:14.740> resolution<00:06:14.950> of<00:06:15.520> 480<00:06:15.790> by<00:06:16.030> 845<00:06:16.960> or

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:17.380 
a much lower resolution of 480 by 845 or

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.230 
a much lower resolution of 480 by 845 or
854<00:06:18.040> but<00:06:18.190> don't<00:06:18.340> let<00:06:18.460> the<00:06:18.550> resolutions<00:06:19.090> on

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
854 but don't let the resolutions on

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.510 
854 but don't let the resolutions on
phones<00:06:19.450> really<00:06:19.720> straight<00:06:20.010> if<00:06:21.010> you<00:06:21.130> don't<00:06:21.460> even

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 
phones really straight if you don't even

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.490 
phones really straight if you don't even
care<00:06:21.790> about<00:06:21.970> that<00:06:22.120> and<00:06:22.990> you<00:06:23.080> don't<00:06:23.170> even<00:06:23.290> know

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:23.500 
care about that and you don't even know

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:24.930 
care about that and you don't even know
the<00:06:23.620> difference<00:06:23.710> you<00:06:24.310> just<00:06:24.490> look<00:06:24.640> at<00:06:24.760> it<00:06:24.790> if

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:24.940 
the difference you just look at it if

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.250 
the difference you just look at it if
it's<00:06:25.090> a<00:06:25.150> beautiful<00:06:25.510> screen<00:06:25.750> you<00:06:25.960> don't<00:06:26.140> care

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:26.260 
it's a beautiful screen you don't care

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.070 
it's a beautiful screen you don't care
what<00:06:26.320> the<00:06:26.440> resolution<00:06:26.680> is<00:06:27.390> quad-core<00:06:28.390> 1.2<00:06:28.870> in

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
what the resolution is quad-core 1.2 in

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.680 
what the resolution is quad-core 1.2 in
this<00:06:29.230> one<00:06:29.380> as<00:06:29.470> well<00:06:29.590> as<00:06:29.830> Adreno<00:06:30.220> 305<00:06:30.580> in<00:06:31.000> it<00:06:31.150> and

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:31.690 
this one as well as Adreno 305 in it and

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.620 
this one as well as Adreno 305 in it and
this<00:06:31.750> one<00:06:31.810> isn't<00:06:32.050> snapdragon<00:06:32.590> 407<00:06:33.400> 410<00:06:33.910> but

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:34.630 
this one isn't snapdragon 407 410 but

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.420 
this one isn't snapdragon 407 410 but
you<00:06:34.750> still<00:06:34.960> get<00:06:35.080> an<00:06:35.170> SD<00:06:35.260> card<00:06:35.380> slot<00:06:35.650> it<00:06:36.100> gets<00:06:36.340> a

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430 
you still get an SD card slot it gets a

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:37.980 
you still get an SD card slot it gets a
memory<00:06:36.730> and<00:06:36.850> a<00:06:36.910> gig<00:06:37.150> of<00:06:37.300> ram<00:06:37.330> and<00:06:37.570> this<00:06:37.690> one<00:06:37.870> so

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:37.990 
memory and a gig of ram and this one so

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.710 
memory and a gig of ram and this one so
they're<00:06:38.110> kind<00:06:38.260> of<00:06:38.290> bumping<00:06:38.560> it<00:06:38.650> down<00:06:39.420> now<00:06:40.420> it's

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 
they're kind of bumping it down now it's

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.900 
they're kind of bumping it down now it's
a<00:06:40.810> 5<00:06:41.020> bill<00:06:41.320> foot<00:06:41.560> for<00:06:42.010> chimo<00:06:42.310> but<00:06:42.670> there<00:06:42.820> are

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:42.910 
a 5 bill foot for chimo but there are

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:44.220 
a 5 bill foot for chimo but there are
some<00:06:43.090> variances<00:06:43.570> you<00:06:43.690> just<00:06:43.840> an<00:06:43.900> 8-megapixel

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:44.230 
some variances you just an 8-megapixel

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:45.560 
some variances you just an 8-megapixel
so<00:06:44.740> that's<00:06:44.890> a<00:06:44.950> good<00:06:45.100> thing
