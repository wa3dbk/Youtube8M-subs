anything<00:00:32.730> this<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:32.910> slightly<00:00:33.270> sped<00:00:33.660> up<00:00:33.809> just

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
anything this is slightly sped up just

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.840 
anything this is slightly sped up just
by<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.710> little<00:00:34.950> bit<00:00:35.010> just<00:00:35.400> wanted<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.640> keep<00:00:35.730> the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
by a little bit just wanted to keep the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.370 
by a little bit just wanted to keep the
video<00:00:36.060> under<00:00:36.150> five<00:00:36.420> minutes<00:00:36.600> but<00:00:36.930> it's<00:00:37.110> barely

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
video under five minutes but it's barely

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.260 
video under five minutes but it's barely
noticeable<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:38.370> don't<00:00:38.550> worry<00:00:38.640> about<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.880> you

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
noticeable so don't worry about it you

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.880 
noticeable so don't worry about it you
should<00:00:39.420> build<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.630> follow<00:00:39.840> along<00:00:40.020> so<00:00:40.590> first

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
should build a follow along so first

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.020 
should build a follow along so first

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
still shooting and you can actually

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.249 
still shooting and you can actually
watch<00:01:56.460> him<00:01:56.520> come<00:01:56.790> up<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.060> stairs<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.840> once<00:01:58.170> he

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
watch him come up the stairs and once he

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.020 
watch him come up the stairs and once he
gets<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.560> about<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.860> top<00:01:59.070> here<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.880> see

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
gets to about the top here and you see

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.670 
gets to about the top here and you see
his<00:02:00.119> mother<00:02:00.299> muzzle<00:02:00.810> flies<00:02:00.960> just<00:02:01.259> back<00:02:01.439> up

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
his mother muzzle flies just back up

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.030 
his mother muzzle flies just back up
he'll<00:02:02.009> stop<00:02:02.310> moving<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:03.710> you<00:02:04.710> can<00:02:04.860> just

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
he'll stop moving and you can just

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.950 
he'll stop moving and you can just
unload<00:02:05.310> on<00:02:05.400> top<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.850> stairs<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.479> if<00:02:06.840> you

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
unload on top of the stairs and if you

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.830 
unload on top of the stairs and if you
both<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.290> you<00:02:07.350> shoot<00:02:07.729> it's<00:02:08.729> three<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.179> two<00:02:09.539> so

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
both of you shoot it's three and two so

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.029 
both of you shoot it's three and two so
make<00:02:09.959> sure<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.170> coordinated<00:02:10.739> so<00:02:10.800> you<00:02:10.890> don't

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
make sure you coordinated so you don't

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.830 
make sure you coordinated so you don't
waste<00:02:11.160> stumpers<00:02:11.610> but<00:02:12.150> you<00:02:12.209> can<00:02:12.300> go<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.420> reload

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
waste stumpers but you can go to reload

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.260 
waste stumpers but you can go to reload
so<00:02:12.870> basically<00:02:13.770> how<00:02:14.220> this<00:02:14.370> works<00:02:14.430> is<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:15.060> back

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
so basically how this works is you back

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.000 
so basically how this works is you back
up<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.690> make<00:02:15.840> a

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
up to make a

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.619 
up to make a
stop<00:02:16.220> you<00:02:16.459> move<00:02:16.640> forward<00:02:16.909> to<00:02:17.209> make<00:02:17.330> a<00:02:17.360> move

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
stop you move forward to make a move

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:18.820 
stop you move forward to make a move
forward<00:02:18.049> so<00:02:18.200> make<00:02:18.319> sure<00:02:18.349> one<00:02:18.590> of<00:02:18.680> you<00:02:18.769> is

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
forward so make sure one of you is

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.740 
forward so make sure one of you is
always<00:02:18.980> sitting<00:02:19.220> them<00:02:19.340> back<00:02:19.519> and<00:02:20.180> this<00:02:20.689> is

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
always sitting them back and this is

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.420 
always sitting them back and this is
where<00:02:20.989> I<00:02:21.049> probably<00:02:21.439> should<00:02:21.709> have<00:02:21.799> gotten<00:02:21.980> ammo

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
where I probably should have gotten ammo

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.500 
where I probably should have gotten ammo
but<00:02:22.610> it<00:02:22.730> doesn't<00:02:23.030> matter

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
but it doesn't matter

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.699 
but it doesn't matter
relapse<00:02:23.840> got<00:02:24.110> it<00:02:24.260> that's<00:02:24.409> more<00:02:24.500> than<00:02:24.680> enough

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
relapse got it that's more than enough

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.649 
relapse got it that's more than enough
and<00:02:25.099> you<00:02:25.189> can<00:02:25.340> actually<00:02:25.519> do<00:02:25.790> this<00:02:25.939> on<00:02:26.090> solo

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:26.659 
and you can actually do this on solo

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:28.509 
and you can actually do this on solo
I've<00:02:26.810> actually<00:02:26.959> done<00:02:27.230> it<00:02:27.319> on<00:02:27.409> solo<00:02:27.860> and<00:02:28.040> it's

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
I've actually done it on solo and it's

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.369 
I've actually done it on solo and it's
not<00:02:28.700> too<00:02:29.000> difficult<00:02:29.510> you<00:02:29.569> just<00:02:29.689> gotta<00:02:30.049> try<00:02:30.349> to

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:30.379 
not too difficult you just gotta try to

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:31.720 
not too difficult you just gotta try to
get<00:02:30.709> if<00:02:30.860> you're<00:02:30.980> gonna<00:02:31.069> do<00:02:31.189> it<00:02:31.280> on<00:02:31.340> sell<00:02:31.519> you're

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
I'm actually getting a little careless

wall there light well from the muzzle
flashes<00:03:02.780> will<00:03:02.900> actually<00:03:03.230> reflect<00:03:03.620> on<00:03:04.010> there

and<00:03:04.879> you'll<00:03:04.970> actually<00:03:05.090> start<00:03:05.269> to<00:03:05.450> see<00:03:05.629> it

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
and you'll actually start to see it

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:06.849 
and you'll actually start to see it
shine<00:03:05.959> through<00:03:05.989> so<00:03:06.409> that<00:03:06.440> means<00:03:06.709> they're

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859 
shine through so that means they're

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:08.110 
shine through so that means they're
getting<00:03:06.950> a<00:03:07.129> little<00:03:07.250> too<00:03:07.430> close<00:03:07.609> you<00:03:07.849> know<00:03:07.909> just

getting a little too close you know just

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.430 
getting a little too close you know just
want<00:03:08.239> to<00:03:08.299> watch<00:03:08.450> how<00:03:09.109> far<00:03:09.409> you<00:03:09.530> are<00:03:09.560> out<00:03:09.950> so

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
the nut exploding because there's a very

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.449 
the nut exploding because there's a very
fine<00:03:44.720> line<00:03:44.959> of<00:03:45.379> where<00:03:45.680> it's<00:03:45.949> going<00:03:46.099> to<00:03:46.160> explode

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
fine line of where it's going to explode

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.009 
fine line of where it's going to explode
and<00:03:46.879> where<00:03:47.090> it's<00:03:47.269> just<00:03:47.359> going<00:03:47.449> to<00:03:47.599> bounce<00:03:47.750> off

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
and where it's just going to bounce off

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.860 
and where it's just going to bounce off
the<00:03:48.139> ground<00:03:48.489> so<00:03:49.489> you<00:03:49.940> basically<00:03:50.090> you<00:03:50.660> need<00:03:50.810> to

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
the ground so you basically you need to

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.439 
the ground so you basically you need to
be<00:03:50.959> really<00:03:51.290> quick<00:03:51.530> reaction<00:03:52.220> on<00:03:52.430> this<00:03:52.639> and

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:53.449 
be really quick reaction on this and

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:55.479 
be really quick reaction on this and
just<00:03:53.660> by<00:03:54.049> seeing<00:03:54.349> them<00:03:54.620> fast<00:03:54.889> enough<00:03:55.040> before

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
just by seeing them fast enough before

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.449 
just by seeing them fast enough before
they<00:03:55.819> can<00:03:56.000> get<00:03:56.150> you<00:03:56.329> and<00:03:56.569> I<00:03:57.099> think<00:03:58.099> this<00:03:58.250> is<00:03:58.400> the

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
they can get you and I think this is the

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.059 
they can get you and I think this is the
part<00:03:58.669> where<00:03:58.819> I<00:03:58.849> got<00:03:59.030> a<00:03:59.060> little<00:03:59.209> careless<00:04:00.069> you

the only flaw in this mission is that

the<00:04:12.229> other<00:04:12.440> way<00:04:12.620> on<00:04:12.769> gamers<00:04:13.159> nation<00:04:13.579> you<00:04:13.699> can't

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
the other way on gamers nation you can't

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.610 
the other way on gamers nation you can't
down<00:04:14.209> pretty<00:04:14.510> much<00:04:14.659> all<00:04:14.810> you<00:04:14.840> happen<00:04:15.290> down<00:04:15.409> and

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
down pretty much all you happen down and

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.710 
down pretty much all you happen down and
one<00:04:15.709> person<00:04:16.010> does<00:04:16.039> but<00:04:16.340> you<00:04:16.430> won't<00:04:16.579> lose<00:04:16.820> this

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
one person does but you won't lose this

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.779 
one person does but you won't lose this
way<00:04:17.959> that<00:04:18.590> was<00:04:18.859> just<00:04:19.070> a<00:04:19.159> little<00:04:19.250> fluke<00:04:19.549> but<00:04:19.699> you

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 
way that was just a little fluke but you

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:20.379 
way that was just a little fluke but you
should<00:04:19.909> be<00:04:19.970> able<00:04:20.030> to<00:04:20.120> do<00:04:20.209> it<00:04:20.269> no<00:04:20.359> problem
