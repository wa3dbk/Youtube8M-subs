about electric bike loss here in the
United<00:00:07.560> States<00:00:07.830> and<00:00:08.130> in<00:00:08.250> Europe<00:00:08.280> and<00:00:08.700> in<00:00:08.820> Asia

it<00:00:58.550> can<00:00:58.730> go

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
it can go

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.510 
it can go
with<00:01:00.110> a<00:01:00.140> little<00:01:00.440> bit<00:01:00.560> of<00:01:00.650> extra<00:01:00.890> rider<00:01:01.220> power

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.130 
with a little bit of extra rider power
and<00:01:01.790> that<00:01:01.850> sort<00:01:02.180> of<00:01:02.239> led<00:01:02.510> to<00:01:02.570> some<00:01:02.840> interesting

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
and that sort of led to some interesting

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.390 
and that sort of led to some interesting
developments<00:01:03.470> that<00:01:03.980> I'm<00:01:04.070> going<00:01:04.190> to<00:01:04.220> talk

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
developments that I'm going to talk

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.270 
developments that I'm going to talk
about<00:01:04.580> now<00:01:05.180> if<00:01:05.360> you're<00:01:05.510> in<00:01:05.630> Europe<00:01:06.080> the<00:01:06.830> top

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
about now if you're in Europe the top

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.480 
about now if you're in Europe the top
speed<00:01:07.670> limitation<00:01:08.570> there<00:01:08.900> is<00:01:09.170> 25<00:01:09.770> kilometers

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
speed limitation there is 25 kilometers

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.010 
speed limitation there is 25 kilometers
per<00:01:10.670> hour<00:01:10.790> for<00:01:11.090> it<00:01:11.180> to<00:01:11.210> be<00:01:11.360> classified<00:01:11.750> as<00:01:11.869> a

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
per hour for it to be classified as a

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.380 
per hour for it to be classified as a
bicycle<00:01:12.560> okay<00:01:12.950> and<00:01:13.160> 25<00:01:13.760> kilometers<00:01:14.210> per<00:01:14.360> hour

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
bicycle okay and 25 kilometers per hour

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.240 
bicycle okay and 25 kilometers per hour
that<00:01:14.660> that<00:01:14.869> translates<00:01:15.260> to<00:01:15.350> about<00:01:15.440> 15<00:01:15.890> point<00:01:16.130> 5

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
that that translates to about 15 point 5

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.350 
that that translates to about 15 point 5
miles<00:01:16.670> per<00:01:16.970> hour

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
miles per hour

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.930 
miles per hour
so<00:01:17.690> it's<00:01:17.840> considerably<00:01:18.290> slower<00:01:18.760> also<00:01:19.760> they

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
so it's considerably slower also they

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.150 
so it's considerably slower also they
have<00:01:20.150> different<00:01:20.900> regulations<00:01:21.140> on<00:01:21.619> motor<00:01:21.860> size

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
have different regulations on motor size

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.420 
have different regulations on motor size
like<00:01:22.430> 250<00:01:23.150> watt<00:01:23.330> in<00:01:23.630> a<00:01:23.720> lot<00:01:23.869> of<00:01:23.990> locations<00:01:24.500> and

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
like 250 watt in a lot of locations and

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.490 
like 250 watt in a lot of locations and
that<00:01:25.520> just<00:01:25.790> you<00:01:26.570> know<00:01:26.660> I<00:01:26.690> think<00:01:26.810> it's<00:01:27.080> designed

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
that just you know I think it's designed

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.200 
that just you know I think it's designed
to<00:01:27.649> keep<00:01:28.100> them<00:01:28.460> a<00:01:28.490> little<00:01:28.610> slower<00:01:29.030> a<00:01:29.149> little

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
to keep them a little slower a little

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.460 
to keep them a little slower a little
safer<00:01:29.690> maybe<00:01:29.869> it's<00:01:30.020> more<00:01:30.170> crowded

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
safer maybe it's more crowded

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.830 
safer maybe it's more crowded
environment

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
the laws in the United States were set

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.200 
the laws in the United States were set
up<00:01:37.580> during<00:01:37.820> the<00:01:38.210> George<00:01:38.600> W<00:01:38.660> Bush<00:01:39.020> era<00:01:39.470> and<00:01:40.210> 750

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
watts is equivalent to one mile or one

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.300 
watts is equivalent to one mile or one
horsepower<00:01:44.480> okay<00:01:45.380> so<00:01:45.440> it<00:01:45.950> was<00:01:46.040> like<00:01:46.190> one

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
horsepower okay so it was like one

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.670 
horsepower okay so it was like one
horsepower<00:01:47.060> you<00:01:47.240> know<00:01:47.330> that<00:01:47.450> sounds<00:01:47.750> good<00:01:47.900> and

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
horsepower you know that sounds good and

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.020 
horsepower you know that sounds good and
you<00:01:48.890> know<00:01:48.980> it's<00:01:49.100> kind<00:01:49.310> of<00:01:49.370> neat<00:01:49.490> that<00:01:49.520> they<00:01:49.820> did

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
you know it's kind of neat that they did

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.510 
you know it's kind of neat that they did
that<00:01:50.150> because<00:01:50.360> the<00:01:50.720> bikes<00:01:50.900> here<00:01:51.260> are<00:01:51.520> they

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
that because the bikes here are they

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.830 
that because the bikes here are they
tend<00:01:52.730> to<00:01:52.760> be<00:01:52.880> a<00:01:52.910> little<00:01:53.030> faster<00:01:53.420> a<00:01:53.450> little<00:01:53.750> bit

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
tend to be a little faster a little bit

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.970 
tend to be a little faster a little bit
better<00:01:53.930> climbers<00:01:54.500> a<00:01:54.530> little<00:01:54.770> bit<00:01:54.860> more

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 
better climbers a little bit more

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.550 
better climbers a little bit more
capable<00:01:55.460> for<00:01:55.730> the<00:01:55.790> longer<00:01:56.120> distances<00:01:56.630> that

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
capable for the longer distances that

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.530 
capable for the longer distances that
that<00:01:57.890> may<00:01:58.070> be<00:01:58.100> required<00:01:58.730> for<00:01:59.210> someone<00:01:59.420> who's

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
that may be required for someone who's

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.120 
that may be required for someone who's
living<00:01:59.780> out<00:01:59.990> in<00:02:00.110> suburbia<00:02:00.590> in<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:00.860> United

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
living out in suburbia in the United

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.490 
living out in suburbia in the United
States<00:02:01.340> now<00:02:01.790> Asia<00:02:02.060> has<00:02:02.390> kind<00:02:02.990> of<00:02:03.050> similar

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
States now Asia has kind of similar

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.320 
States now Asia has kind of similar
similar<00:02:04.070> rules<00:02:04.310> as<00:02:04.610> the<00:02:04.760> United<00:02:05.060> States<00:02:05.270> I

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
similar rules as the United States I

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.180 
similar rules as the United States I
think<00:02:05.360> it's<00:02:05.570> like<00:02:05.690> 19<00:02:06.200> miles<00:02:06.470> per<00:02:06.650> hour<00:02:06.860> in

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
think it's like 19 miles per hour in

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.530 
think it's like 19 miles per hour in
China<00:02:07.460> and<00:02:07.700> they've<00:02:07.790> had<00:02:07.970> certain<00:02:08.270> cities

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:08.540 
China and they've had certain cities

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.270 
China and they've had certain cities
that<00:02:08.750> have<00:02:09.200> kind<00:02:09.350> of<00:02:09.440> outlawed<00:02:09.860> electric

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
that have kind of outlawed electric

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.100 
that have kind of outlawed electric
bikes<00:02:10.460> but<00:02:10.610> then<00:02:10.760> they've<00:02:10.880> received<00:02:11.240> pressure

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
bikes but then they've received pressure

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.600 
bikes but then they've received pressure
because<00:02:12.470> so<00:02:12.590> many<00:02:12.680> people<00:02:12.800> need<00:02:13.220> to<00:02:13.280> need<00:02:13.580> a

because so many people need to need a

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.240 
because so many people need to need a
way<00:02:13.790> to<00:02:13.850> get<00:02:14.060> around<00:02:14.560> they've<00:02:15.560> kind<00:02:15.800> of<00:02:15.860> taken

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
way to get around they've kind of taken

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.370 
way to get around they've kind of taken
those<00:02:16.430> taking<00:02:17.210> those<00:02:17.330> restrictions<00:02:17.750> off<00:02:18.080> in<00:02:18.290> a

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
those taking those restrictions off in a

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.320 
those taking those restrictions off in a

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.570 

but<00:02:24.330> there<00:02:24.450> are<00:02:24.510> still<00:02:24.720> still<00:02:25.200> rules<00:02:25.500> sort<00:02:26.490> of

but there are still still rules sort of

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.730 
but there are still still rules sort of
at<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.790> state<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.360> city<00:02:27.900> level<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.440> in<00:02:28.560> all

at the state and city level and in all
of<00:02:28.920> these<00:02:29.069> different<00:02:29.760> parts<00:02:30.540> of<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.780> world

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
of these different parts of the world

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.270 
of these different parts of the world
right<00:02:31.260> in<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.440> United<00:02:31.740> States<00:02:32.010> there<00:02:32.220> are

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
right in the United States there are

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.040 
right in the United States there are
certain<00:02:32.550> trails<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:33.120> places<00:02:33.450> that<00:02:33.480> restrict

certain trails and places that restrict

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.350 
certain trails and places that restrict
electric<00:02:34.440> bikes<00:02:34.680> or<00:02:35.610> more

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
electric bikes or more

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.410 
electric bikes or more
I<00:02:36.390> guess<00:02:37.380> just<00:02:37.410> strict<00:02:37.950> about<00:02:38.190> how<00:02:38.790> how<00:02:39.209> they

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
I guess just strict about how how they

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.840 
I guess just strict about how how they
interpret<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:39.959> laws<00:02:40.370> and<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.670> that's

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
interpret the laws and and that's

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.760 
interpret the laws and and that's
something<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.180> keep<00:02:42.420> in<00:02:42.480> mind<00:02:42.720> but<00:02:43.230> in<00:02:43.350> general

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
something to keep in mind but in general

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.190 
something to keep in mind but in general
if<00:02:43.890> you're<00:02:43.980> riding<00:02:44.690> responsibly<00:02:45.690> and<00:02:46.020> you're

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
if you're riding responsibly and you're

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.690 
if you're riding responsibly and you're
following<00:02:46.590> those<00:02:46.709> laws<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.340> you've<00:02:47.550> got

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
following those laws that you've got

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.910 
following those laws that you've got
that<00:02:47.880> federal<00:02:48.330> mandate<00:02:49.290> in<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.560> United

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
that federal mandate in the United

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.830 
that federal mandate in the United
States<00:02:50.190> which<00:02:50.610> you<00:02:50.850> can<00:02:51.000> really<00:02:51.209> fall<00:02:51.390> back<00:02:51.630> on

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
States which you can really fall back on

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.630 
States which you can really fall back on
so<00:02:52.080> here<00:02:52.530> are<00:02:52.620> a<00:02:52.650> couple<00:02:52.680> of<00:02:52.980> electric<00:02:53.430> bikes

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
so here are a couple of electric bikes

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.570 
so here are a couple of electric bikes
that<00:02:54.150> do<00:02:54.540> satisfy<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:55.470> low-speed<00:02:56.100> electric

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
that do satisfy that low-speed electric

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.060 
that do satisfy that low-speed electric
bike<00:02:56.900> guideline<00:02:57.900> what<00:02:58.620> we're<00:02:58.739> looking<00:02:58.950> at

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.090 
bike guideline what we're looking at
here<00:02:59.340> is<00:02:59.519> an<00:02:59.670> energy<00:03:00.060> 2.6<00:03:00.870> TM<00:03:01.230> it's<00:03:01.860> got<00:03:02.070> a

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
low-speed electric bike in the United

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.550 
low-speed electric bike in the United
States<00:03:24.120> because<00:03:24.600> it's<00:03:24.840> only<00:03:25.050> able<00:03:25.319> to<00:03:25.410> reach

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
States because it's only able to reach

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.770 
States because it's only able to reach
those<00:03:25.769> higher<00:03:26.040> speeds<00:03:26.459> when<00:03:27.180> you<00:03:27.329> pedal<00:03:27.660> along

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
those higher speeds when you pedal along

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.670 
those higher speeds when you pedal along
rigorously<00:03:28.769> okay<00:03:29.640> so<00:03:29.989> essentially<00:03:30.989> if<00:03:31.380> this

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
rigorously okay so essentially if this

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.590 
rigorously okay so essentially if this
was<00:03:31.860> operating<00:03:32.430> under<00:03:32.519> throttle<00:03:33.030> power<00:03:33.209> alone

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
was operating under throttle power alone

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.380 
was operating under throttle power alone
it<00:03:34.079> would<00:03:34.260> still<00:03:34.560> top<00:03:34.860> out<00:03:35.070> at<00:03:35.340> 20<00:03:36.060> miles<00:03:36.209> per

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
it would still top out at 20 miles per

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.940 
it would still top out at 20 miles per

as<00:03:41.340> you<00:03:41.610> pedal<00:03:41.760> along<00:03:42.000> essentially<00:03:42.780> the<00:03:43.170> motor

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
as you pedal along essentially the motor

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.530 
as you pedal along essentially the motor
just<00:03:43.920> doesn't<00:03:44.220> stop<00:03:44.459> it's<00:03:44.730> still<00:03:45.000> offering

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
just doesn't stop it's still offering

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.289 
just doesn't stop it's still offering
you<00:03:45.690> that<00:03:45.870> incremental<00:03:46.500> boost<00:03:46.890> and<00:03:47.790> they<00:03:48.120> have

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
you that incremental boost and they have

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.569 
you that incremental boost and they have
similar<00:03:48.720> designs<00:03:49.260> in<00:03:49.470> Europe<00:03:49.769> and<00:03:50.250> in<00:03:50.370> fact

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
similar designs in Europe and in fact

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:53.090 
similar designs in Europe and in fact
this<00:03:51.269> bike<00:03:51.540> is<00:03:51.870> available<00:03:52.530> in<00:03:52.650> Europe<00:03:52.890> but

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
this bike is available in Europe but

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.069 
this bike is available in Europe but
over<00:03:53.730> there<00:03:53.940> there<00:03:54.239> they're<00:03:54.540> a<00:03:54.570> little<00:03:54.900> bit

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
over there there they're a little bit

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.140 
over there there they're a little bit
more<00:03:55.109> strict<00:03:55.590> about<00:03:55.709> the<00:03:56.280> top<00:03:56.579> speed<00:03:57.000> and

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
more strict about the top speed and

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.340 
more strict about the top speed and
limiting<00:03:57.540> you<00:03:57.660> and<00:03:57.840> they<00:03:58.019> out<00:03:58.140> they<00:03:58.260> have

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
limiting you and they out they have

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.319 
limiting you and they out they have
these<00:03:58.470> other<00:03:58.650> requirements<00:03:59.340> so<00:03:59.489> essentially

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
these other requirements so essentially

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:01.729 
these other requirements so essentially
if<00:04:00.420> you<00:04:00.540> had<00:04:00.720> this<00:04:00.870> bike<00:04:01.079> in<00:04:01.230> Europe<00:04:01.470> you<00:04:01.620> would

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
if you had this bike in Europe you would

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.770 
if you had this bike in Europe you would
need<00:04:01.890> to<00:04:02.130> have<00:04:02.549> a<00:04:02.579> little<00:04:02.760> license<00:04:03.209> plate<00:04:03.480> of

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
need to have a little license plate of

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.130 
need to have a little license plate of
course<00:04:04.410> it<00:04:04.560> would<00:04:04.680> need<00:04:04.859> these<00:04:05.370> lights<00:04:06.140> which

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
course it would need these lights which

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.840 
course it would need these lights which
get<00:04:07.890> carried<00:04:08.190> over<00:04:08.310> to<00:04:08.459> the<00:04:08.519> United<00:04:08.820> States

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
get carried over to the United States

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.940 
get carried over to the United States
version<00:04:09.390> and<00:04:09.540> then<00:04:09.989> these<00:04:10.200> little<00:04:10.500> nubs<00:04:10.709> on

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
version and then these little nubs on

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.289 
version and then these little nubs on
the<00:04:11.070> end<00:04:11.220> of<00:04:11.340> brake<00:04:11.519> levers<00:04:11.850> so<00:04:11.970> if<00:04:12.060> you<00:04:12.150> ever

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
the end of brake levers so if you ever

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.060 
the end of brake levers so if you ever
see<00:04:12.570> these<00:04:12.750> on<00:04:13.049> a<00:04:13.079> bike<00:04:13.320> in<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.530> US<00:04:13.829> you're

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
see these on a bike in the US you're

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.710 
see these on a bike in the US you're
like<00:04:14.160> what<00:04:14.310> are<00:04:14.400> those<00:04:14.489> nubs<00:04:14.760> it's<00:04:15.060> because

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
like what are those nubs it's because

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.539 
like what are those nubs it's because
that's<00:04:15.900> a<00:04:16.019> requirement<00:04:16.140> in<00:04:16.709> Europe<00:04:17.039> and<00:04:17.280> maybe

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
that's a requirement in Europe and maybe

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.449 
that's a requirement in Europe and maybe
just<00:04:17.820> helps<00:04:18.090> your<00:04:18.239> fingers<00:04:18.600> not<00:04:18.840> slip<00:04:19.289> off<00:04:19.459> I

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
just helps your fingers not slip off I

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.370 
just helps your fingers not slip off I
think<00:04:21.120> the<00:04:21.180> argument<00:04:21.600> in<00:04:21.690> the<00:04:21.750> United<00:04:22.079> States

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
think the argument in the United States

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.140 
think the argument in the United States
for<00:04:22.890> a<00:04:22.919> lot<00:04:23.039> of<00:04:23.130> people<00:04:23.400> has<00:04:23.550> been<00:04:23.700> well<00:04:23.940> gosh

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
for a lot of people has been well gosh

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.610 
for a lot of people has been well gosh
you<00:04:24.180> know<00:04:24.450> I<00:04:24.479> have<00:04:24.660> a<00:04:24.690> road<00:04:24.960> bike<00:04:25.169> and<00:04:25.410> I<00:04:25.440> can

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
you know I have a road bike and I can

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.710 
you know I have a road bike and I can
hit<00:04:26.070> 40<00:04:26.520> miles<00:04:26.700> per<00:04:26.850> hour<00:04:27.030> you<00:04:27.330> know<00:04:27.419> so<00:04:27.600> why

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
hit 40 miles per hour you know so why

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.590 
hit 40 miles per hour you know so why
not<00:04:27.930> my<00:04:28.050> electric<00:04:28.500> bike<00:04:28.650> and<00:04:28.919> you<00:04:29.340> know

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
not my electric bike and you know

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.880 
not my electric bike and you know
basically<00:04:30.600> there's<00:04:30.780> that<00:04:30.960> compromise<00:04:31.530> where

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
basically there's that compromise where

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.430 
basically there's that compromise where
yep<00:04:32.760> throttle<00:04:33.240> only<00:04:33.510> 20<00:04:33.960> miles<00:04:34.110> per<00:04:34.260> hour

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
yep throttle only 20 miles per hour

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.159 
yep throttle only 20 miles per hour
that's<00:04:34.770> the<00:04:34.890> limit

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
that's the limit

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.129 
that's the limit
but<00:04:35.650> if<00:04:35.800> you<00:04:35.919> pedal<00:04:36.219> along<00:04:36.479> you<00:04:37.479> you<00:04:37.719> you<00:04:37.930> can

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
but if you pedal along you you you can

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:39.360 
but if you pedal along you you you can
get<00:04:38.289> a<00:04:38.319> little<00:04:38.529> higher<00:04:38.710> and<00:04:38.740> in<00:04:39.009> this<00:04:39.159> case

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
get a little higher and in this case

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.909 
get a little higher and in this case
this<00:04:39.580> motor<00:04:39.879> is<00:04:40.090> 200<00:04:40.930> watts<00:04:41.110> nominal<00:04:41.650> but<00:04:41.830> it

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
this motor is 200 watts nominal but it

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.429 
this motor is 200 watts nominal but it
peaks<00:04:42.279> at<00:04:43.050> 750<00:04:44.050> so<00:04:44.199> they're<00:04:44.349> really

00:04:44.429 --> 00:04:44.439 
peaks at 750 so they're really

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:45.689 
peaks at 750 so they're really
satisfying<00:04:45.039> all<00:04:45.249> of<00:04:45.400> those<00:04:45.520> other

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
satisfying all of those other

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:47.790 
satisfying all of those other
requirements<00:04:45.909> and<00:04:46.569> and<00:04:47.110> frankly<00:04:47.469> it<00:04:47.560> doesn't

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
requirements and and frankly it doesn't

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.409 
requirements and and frankly it doesn't
actually<00:04:47.919> have<00:04:48.310> a<00:04:48.639> throttle<00:04:48.879> mode<00:04:49.150> it<00:04:49.270> does

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
actually have a throttle mode it does

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:50.760 
actually have a throttle mode it does
have<00:04:49.599> a<00:04:49.629> little<00:04:49.840> bit<00:04:49.930> of<00:04:49.960> a<00:04:50.080> walk<00:04:50.289> mode<00:04:50.560> if<00:04:50.740> you

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
have a little bit of a walk mode if you

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.149 
have a little bit of a walk mode if you
hold<00:04:51.520> that<00:04:51.729> the<00:04:52.060> nub<00:04:52.300> in<00:04:53.050> in<00:04:53.439> sort<00:04:53.620> of<00:04:53.740> the<00:04:53.860> the

00:04:54.149 --> 00:04:54.159 
hold that the nub in in sort of the the

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:56.249 
hold that the nub in in sort of the the
up<00:04:54.310> position<00:04:54.909> and<00:04:55.060> a<00:04:55.360> lot<00:04:55.509> of<00:04:55.599> European<00:04:55.960> bikes

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:56.259 
up position and a lot of European bikes

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:57.450 
up position and a lot of European bikes
have<00:04:56.469> that<00:04:56.620> as<00:04:56.770> well<00:04:56.919> that's<00:04:57.189> that's

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
have that as well that's that's

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:58.890 
have that as well that's that's
different<00:04:57.699> from<00:04:57.939> a<00:04:58.090> throttle<00:04:58.449> it<00:04:58.539> just<00:04:58.719> kind

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
different from a throttle it just kind

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.360 
different from a throttle it just kind
of<00:04:58.960> helps<00:04:59.199> you<00:04:59.349> if<00:04:59.499> you're<00:04:59.620> pushing<00:04:59.889> this<00:05:00.129> up<00:05:00.249> a

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
of helps you if you're pushing this up a

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.580 
of helps you if you're pushing this up a
hill<00:05:00.580> and<00:05:01.210> you're<00:05:01.479> not<00:05:01.659> necessarily<00:05:01.960> riding

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
hill and you're not necessarily riding

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.649 
hill and you're not necessarily riding
it<00:05:02.710> so<00:05:02.979> I<00:05:03.189> wanted<00:05:03.699> to<00:05:03.789> clarify<00:05:03.969> and<00:05:04.240> this<00:05:04.509> is

00:05:04.649 --> 00:05:04.659 
it so I wanted to clarify and this is

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:07.499 
it so I wanted to clarify and this is
kind<00:05:05.259> of<00:05:05.289> a<00:05:05.409> special<00:05:05.860> a<00:05:06.490> special<00:05:07.150> bike<00:05:07.300> in<00:05:07.449> the

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:07.509 
kind of a special a special bike in the

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:08.700 
kind of a special a special bike in the
United<00:05:07.779> States<00:05:07.960> it<00:05:08.110> was<00:05:08.199> one<00:05:08.349> of<00:05:08.379> the<00:05:08.499> first

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
United States it was one of the first

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.489 
United States it was one of the first
that<00:05:09.009> offer<00:05:09.490> that<00:05:09.849> that<00:05:10.330> higher<00:05:10.629> top<00:05:11.050> speed

00:05:11.489 --> 00:05:11.499 
that offer that that higher top speed

exploring why we were able to check this
out<00:06:06.789> and<00:06:07.060> I'll<00:06:07.300> see<00:06:07.779> if<00:06:07.870> for<00:06:08.020> more<00:06:08.169> primers
