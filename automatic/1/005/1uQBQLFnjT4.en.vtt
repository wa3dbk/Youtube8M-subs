00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 good your come to a good new video 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.290
 no details of places are four that we 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.150
 come from the gdc the hair 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.400
 perez conference problem that are being 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.590
 celebrating and good basically because in 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.020
 the details that good some knew me 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.180
 I'm not going to say the ones that I'm going to 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.789
 try mixing them a bit to 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.949
 remind people of different things 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:25.500
 as a novelty they have said that it will have a 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.849
 Hard drive capacity not know 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.500
 how much will be great for them 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.939
 capabilities but that is a terabyte by 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.800
 least because I guess the games 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.219
 will occupy more when we download from 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.270
 precision stories such and good seems 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.300
 be that in the resolution of the panel 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.800
 tactile in front because it will be 1920 x 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.329
 900 things that I did not understand very well 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.070
 because it does not usually conclude tactile could 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.149
 have resolution basically by 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.950
 explain a little above that 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.629
 someone correct me is for example that if 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.550
 a touch panel has more resolution 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.680
 it will go better in different areas 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.420
 for example let's give an example of 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.309
 a face we do not want to touch 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.390
 just the pupil with the finger then 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.219
 with the finger to be very large not 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.960
 could we use a pencil and 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.910
 we could another the pupil in case of 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.010
 have less resolution can detect and 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.790
 at least not in the area that we want to play 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.290
 good 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.090
 those explained in a way but good 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.280
 the resolution of the touch plant 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.960
 will be very high not to confuse what will be 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.080
 a screen to see nothing the screen 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.460
 touch will be a normal touch panel 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.080
 normal and current will also serve 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.780
 supposedly to move around the 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.700
 playstation menu once you know 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.200
 that will have a kind of light the command 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.870
 of the playstation on the 24th and it's from 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.250
 for different things like to know 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.380
 how many students is the character 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.030
 imagined example we have little time left 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.680
 life a character gets for camera 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.910
 in red and good means that we have left 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.090
 for life not to interact anymore 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.820
 apart from that it is also known that each 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.680
 player will have a color for example 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.810
 let's say we have a playstation 4 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.759
 with four controls connected as the 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.619
 command one would be blue the command two 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.930
 would be red the command 3 would be green and the 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.700
 command 4 in pink that is the different 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.560
 fields that is the different connectors 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.190
 of each command would be a color for 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.680
 know how to identify which command is 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.600
 who in the resolution of the camera 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.470
 the new dual camera that will have two 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.900
 cameras and I think also four four 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.070
 microphones or four microphones if I do not 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.050
 I'm wrong, I think there were two 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.590
 cameras and four microphones forgive me 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.330
 If I 'm wrong I'm very tired I'm 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.790
 seeing many things at once today good 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.640
 by the resolution of the camera will be 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.290
 1280 x 800 and it seems that it will not have 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.480
 a normal usb connection says that 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.820
 will use a totally new connector 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.620
 with which, well, we forget about 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.239
 be able to connect it to the pc so it seems 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.420
 but it's probably true that in some 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:44.000
 type of converter of this connector and such 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.410
 and well we can use it anywhere 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.090
 because it would be very good especially 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.459
 for youtube or a camera of this 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.560
 caliber because it looks good according to 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.820
 It is also said good in the camera 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.770
 it would also serve to 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.420
 voice recognition how they are used 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.980
 kinect and not know what capacity 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.080
 I would still not be very confirmed 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.720
 all that which is confirmed 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.440
 It is also that if there are four 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.750
 will finally increase 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.300
 friends of precision network currently 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.210
 remember that they are 100 friends and it seems to be 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.070
 that will rise from 100 to more you do not know 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.720
 how many more can we add but good 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.670
 it's good news because a lot of people 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.440
 he asks me to add me although I do not know what I do not know 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.450
 how much and grenade I do not have space for 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.070
 all because I already have the 100 friends that 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.990
 upload this is a good idea 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.580
 it also seems that we can put 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.560
 our real name so that for 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.480
 identify us companies are companies in 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.370
 which hopefully settles in 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.960
 same precise network that you had 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.400
 companies are three complexes are four 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.840
 because they 're either shitty because everyone 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.240
 the trophies of everything I have can 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.800
 share the jobs and they are four 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.140
 I suppose the avatar can be 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.569
 customize on the subject of who can 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.879
 put the photo you want and such 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:49.819
 few more things have been said good since 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:52.099
 you know the remote play / pressure 4 are 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.780
 views and especially one thing very 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.310
 important it seems that there will be a 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.379
 application from the mobiles that we 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.889
 will allow from getting into the towers and 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:02.750
 anywhere, download things 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:05.900
 automatically or we get the 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:09.480
 astoria and we put download in the 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:12.030
 phone download we can 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.519
 and download it what we want or 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.829
 the console will then download us and 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.900
 such something seemed like what happens in xbox 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.980
 360 when we get on the page in 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.450
 the official page of xbox in 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.280
 in our computer that we can 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.020
 download something and then on the console it 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.460
 is unloading us I guess those 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.980
 are four will have some kind of system 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.480
 to stay all the time in standby and 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.130
 This may be when we download the 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.080
 Mobile game you can start 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.030
 automatically download prices are 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.230
 four so good nothing else I do not know if 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.850
 I explained well all of the 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.370
 ways below the description you will have 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:46.580
 all the information that I just said and 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:49.520
 some more so as you see 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.470
 technical stuff of the console and such kind 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.250
 of things and nothing are going in the next 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.250
 video was approached another
