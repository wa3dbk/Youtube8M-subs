00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
yesterday obviously the first game of

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.230 
yesterday obviously the first game of
the<00:01:22.470> series<00:01:22.710> look<00:01:23.220> as<00:01:23.400> if<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.880> were<00:01:24.030> about

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
the series look as if you were about

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.240 
the series look as if you were about
loose<00:01:24.600> throughout<00:01:25.049> like<00:01:25.259> most<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.070> game

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
loose throughout like most of the game

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.830 
loose throughout like most of the game
and<00:01:26.460> then<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.700> managed<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.119> turn<00:01:27.299> around<00:01:27.479> so

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
and then you managed to turn around so

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.940 
and then you managed to turn around so
don't<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.140> think<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.530> rubberband

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
don't you think that the rubberband

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.620 
don't you think that the rubberband
affected<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.670> don't<00:01:30.360> think<00:01:30.479> we<00:01:30.540> were

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
affected that I don't think we were

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.330 
affected that I don't think we were
about<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.900> lose<00:01:31.079> I<00:01:31.259> think<00:01:31.290> we<00:01:31.500> actually<00:01:31.979> had<00:01:32.220> an

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
about to lose I think we actually had an

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.090 
about to lose I think we actually had an
advantage<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.820> whole<00:01:32.970> game

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
advantage the whole game

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.630 
advantage the whole game
we<00:01:34.610> sort<00:01:34.820> of<00:01:34.880> shoot<00:01:35.060> about<00:01:35.299> it<00:01:35.450> away<00:01:36.770> so

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
we sort of shoot about it away so

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.580 
we sort of shoot about it away so
obviously<00:01:38.119> now<00:01:38.720> you're<00:01:38.900> in<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.049> finals<00:01:39.409> then

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
obviously now you're in the finals then

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.140 
obviously now you're in the finals then
and<00:01:39.799> it'll<00:01:40.040> be<00:01:40.130> either<00:01:40.280> cloud<00:01:40.580> now<00:01:40.759> and<00:01:41.000> it'll

do you feel about him playing in

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.009 
do you feel about him playing in
comparison<00:02:08.209> to<00:02:08.239> black<00:02:08.509> because<00:02:08.810> how<00:02:08.959> is

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 
comparison to black because how is

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:10.419 
comparison to black because how is
considered<00:02:09.590> more<00:02:09.679> aggressive<00:02:10.160> than<00:02:10.250> black

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
considered more aggressive than black

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.670 
considered more aggressive than black
was<00:02:10.610> always<00:02:11.300> really<00:02:11.450> good<00:02:11.600> competitive<00:02:12.200> like

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
was always really good competitive like

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.100 
was always really good competitive like
I<00:02:13.400> would<00:02:14.120> say<00:02:14.269> how<00:02:14.390> is<00:02:14.540> definitely<00:02:14.870> a<00:02:14.900> better

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
I would say how is definitely a better

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.900 
I would say how is definitely a better
carry<00:02:15.410> player<00:02:15.620> compared<00:02:16.250> to<00:02:16.310> black<00:02:16.489> because

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
carry player compared to black because

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.900 
carry player compared to black because
and<00:02:17.510> if<00:02:17.750> it's<00:02:18.260> all<00:02:18.410> team<00:02:18.590> FL<00:02:18.890> and<00:02:19.160> chemistry<00:02:19.790> at

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
and if it's all team FL and chemistry at

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.259 
and if it's all team FL and chemistry at
all<00:02:19.940> black<00:02:20.900> would<00:02:21.050> be<00:02:21.080> good<00:02:21.530> enough<00:02:21.739> for<00:02:22.269> one

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
all black would be good enough for one

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.900 
all black would be good enough for one
team<00:02:23.569> I<00:02:23.690> guess<00:02:23.870> one<00:02:24.500> carry<00:02:24.920> for<00:02:25.190> five<00:02:25.430> four

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
team I guess one carry for five four

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.080 
team I guess one carry for five four
supports<00:02:26.360> care<00:02:26.630> of<00:02:26.690> him<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:27.590> how<00:02:27.830> we<00:02:27.890> how<00:02:28.819> jobs

blame was levied on all the members of
the<00:02:44.690> team<00:02:44.840> but<00:02:45.110> like<00:02:45.260> it<00:02:45.590> was<00:02:45.769> how<00:02:45.950> just

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
the team but like it was how just

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.630 
the team but like it was how just
motivated<00:02:46.910> as<00:02:47.000> soon<00:02:47.120> as<00:02:47.209> he<00:02:47.299> joined<00:02:47.510> vici<00:02:48.640> I'm

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
motivated as soon as he joined vici I'm

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.160 
motivated as soon as he joined vici I'm
not<00:02:49.880> really<00:02:49.970> sure<00:02:50.209> how<00:02:50.329> Hall<00:02:50.600> was<00:02:50.810> like<00:02:51.019> before

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
not really sure how Hall was like before

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.069 
not really sure how Hall was like before
so<00:02:51.920> I<00:02:51.950> couldn't<00:02:52.340> see<00:02:52.489> anything<00:02:53.090> I<00:02:53.209> wanted<00:02:53.480> how

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
so I couldn't see anything I wanted how

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.039 
so I couldn't see anything I wanted how
its<00:02:54.260> really<00:02:54.440> motivated<00:02:54.859> yeah<00:02:55.190> so<00:02:56.019> yeah<00:02:57.019> I

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049
