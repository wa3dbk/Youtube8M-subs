00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.379
 hello everyone welcome to a new 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.299
 web video repair yourself the 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:14.820
 present video taking advantage of that I have 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:17.490
 tilted the washing machine since I'm going to 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.680
 Replace the brushes of the 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.480
 washing motor the same in a 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.160
 repair they have had since they did not have 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.789
 of a new replacement of colo that 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.980
 brushes already used then they are 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.009
 practically at the end of its useful life and 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.540
 before the failure error and 8 will 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.190
 proceed to replace them but 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.550
 well this is not the purpose of the video 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.110
 since I tilt the washing machine 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.960
 has happened that you could tell us a 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.230
 couple of little things 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.120
 If you have lost any ring of 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.620
 woman bra for example in the 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.350
 washing machine a fault that is usually 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.019
 quite common they are introduced 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.260
 inside the holes of the 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:59.750
 Cuba and they end at the bottom 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.930
 finish at the bottom as they rub 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.750
 sound etcetera etcetera and we do not know 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.600
 how can we get them out to get a ring 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.600
 bra woman from Cuba 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.130
 washing machine that has been introduced to us 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.920
 we have we have two options in the 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.240
 oslo website explained but good and 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.789
 that we have the video so why not 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.550
 put it the first option would be 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:24.979
 dismantle the resistance for the part 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.810
 back of the machine disconnect and 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:32.170
 masters clear machine is off the plug 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:35.500
 the same we have are its loose end 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:38.409
 We tilt the machine and take out the 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.470
 resistance disconnect and we love your two 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:46.649
 connectors disconnected the probe in etc 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.649
 what it takes is to say we would take 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:54.020
 1 and in another 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:56.150
 we would remove the online etc and we 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.420
 allow a wrench out 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:02.540
 the central screw that loosens the rubber 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.210
 which makes resistance board with 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.830
 this we could extract the resistance in 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.920
 photos you have not explained on the page 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.050
 web and carefully with a magnet and with a 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.490
 we could try to look at 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.890
 see where we got wet 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.480
 the bra ring or what we have 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.580
 lost inside the vat of the 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.490
 washing machine and we could try to take out the 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.380
 same if by this opening it does not 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.710
 we got or this opening the 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.930
 You would see a bit complicated since according to 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.420
 what kind of washing machine because the truth is 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.010
 that getting out here can complicate a 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.260
 bit 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.739
 we have another option that already live 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.770
 depends on the washing machine model that would be 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:47.890
 through the bottom of the machine 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.740
 where is the drain tube of the 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:54.380
 machine we would have to drop the 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:57.860
 Clamp that bears on the side 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:01.310
 will release said tube and the same with a 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.350
 small mirror or a flashlight and with 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.450
 Care if we tilt the machine 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.820
 possibly the bra ring though 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.010
 we have lost is going to tilt for the 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.320
 side where the drain is because I say 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.030
 Carefully try to remove it by the tube 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.250
 drain 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.930
 the best option to me has passed me a couple 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.480
 of times it is by the side of the 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.000
 resistance here is usually where 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.030
 you can see lost objects better and 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.830
 they can be but good that you know that 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.490
 you have the option of being able to take it out 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.810
 also by the bottom 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:36.220
 since you are touching the drain pipe 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.850
 to observe that you do not have any 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.470
 object lost in the surprise I since 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.660
 I was in front of a tilted machine 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.530
 touched the tube and here in the part 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.140
 lower 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.810
 I have found that there is a lost object 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.030
 I do not know what it is 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.380
 I do not know what will be I suppose it will be a screw 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.480
 or something that I usually carry around 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:59.290
 pockets or a coin looks more like a 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:02.200
 screw but good instead of taking out the 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.030
 rubber pump drain the 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.380
 machine what I will do is take out the filter 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.330
 on the front when I kind of like 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.849
 machine well and we'll see what it is 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:13.750
 that has then nothing out the other 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:15.280
 repair as with the machine well and 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.510
 we will see what is lost there 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.940
 in the drain pipe 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.900
 once the separation that 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.250
 I had to make him 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.650
 let's continue with what we 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:30.180
 he commented seeing what is hidden 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:32.870
 in the filter since there was some old 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.870
 out there lost 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:39.590
 since the bowl that is a use 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.590
 usually nothing I have now at hand 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:43.229
 we turn the filter 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:53.600
 and this time 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.600
 and two coins 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:02.270
 to put the finger and check with the 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:07.750
 flashlight that nothing else jammed 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.750
 you do not see anything in the background at the pump 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:16.509
 many eyes and stick your fingers have 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:19.539
 careful since it would not be the first time 

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:21.920
 that maybe a pin or some 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:24.680
 sharp element 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.510
 although it was not possible to strain but nothing 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.150
 it seems that this time 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.620
 there were only two coins of these 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.870
 typical that we carry in our pockets 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:36.490
 always and by a pelvis to the 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.490
 pants finish in the washing machine 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.640
 Well I hope you liked the 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.680
 video one more complement in many 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.930
 videos about washing machines topics that I'm going 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.450
 going up and that little by little I'm doing 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:49.460
 almost always or always you see that it is 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:52.580
 with my life 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:55.009
 Efe 12 100 as you see a simple washing machine 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.530
 it does not matter that there are many models the 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:06:00.410
 hand can give us to harm enough 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:02.349
 things about them and nothing that's what 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.729
 that I like to me on the subject of 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:07.550
 teaching learn and transmit 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:09.889
 knowledge what is said for all a 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:13.960
 greeting and keep visiting website 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:13.960
