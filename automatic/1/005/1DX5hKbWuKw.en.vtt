00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.339
 hello people welcome to 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.390
 my first tutorial about battlefield 3 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:07.830
 in the tutorial I want you 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.040
 actually only show how you yours 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.860
 skill can improve something and so on 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.890
 few tips on public but also on 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.170
 eg ssl vpn or various other leagues 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.170
 applicable are good 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.580
 First, the settings you see 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.199
 already with me it is in English 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.939
 I will try as much as possible 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.230
 to translate in the window would have 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.910
 actually do nothing except that 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.410
 foreign city ​​you should be like that 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.420
 adjust as it is best for you 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.160
 it does not just depend on the mouse 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.930
 but also on the mouse pad that he used to 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.110
 for example, some give more 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.420
 resisted the others less 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.579
 it's about a third and yes 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.530
 that looks like the whole looks like this 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.820
 with me when i slow my mouse 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.070
 moves when I move fast 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.789
 But from that you have to completely for 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:00.949
 adjust yourself alone 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:02.699
 that is actually relative 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.519
 irrelevant here 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.869
 Here you can set weapons again 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.700
 zoom should be if only once 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.220
 so you only want to click once and then 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.930
 it stays that way or the button must hold 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.020
 the right mouse button I have now 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.689
 stopped being important is important 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.610
 So the audio loudness should you 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.549
 Now adjust it so that you when you go to 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.530
 For example, teamspeak are yours 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.189
 small comrades heard but still in 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:33.119
 Game sound still hears good because steps 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:36.420
 are very important or vote etc yes 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.490
 then on your system speaker system 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.259
 it probably means with me 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.869
 audio output is likely in German 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.399
 Hot should definitely be on headset 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.340
 switch if you play with headsets 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.840
 what I think of most now 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.790
 you can do the extended die mode 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.079
 switch off and the language is 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.770
 actually and relevant I think that 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:58.320
 English dubbing better now 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.119
 comes the main point video 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.799
 with monitor one recommends itself also 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.240
 if you have several but a monitor 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.420
 is easier to survey 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.940
 the resolution is me now 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.560
 full hd at 60 hertz should also be on 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.080
 the biggest thing is possible with you 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.170
 with newer monitors it is the 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.540
 resolution 1920 x 1080 actually 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.340
 standard fullscreen you can do it yourself 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.080
 I decide now on 1 the 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.989
 wide you should adjust so that 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.700
 he sees it better if you do 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.860
 she has very high on dark especially 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.630
 maps but there is still something worth it 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.760
 on the graphic the vertical one 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.870
 Synchronization should be set up 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:40.950
 the field of vision changes so I at 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.230
 now at 70 I put something up 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.519
 yes, I'll just talk to her 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.590
 then just have a bigger field of vision 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.870
 You should always increase a bit 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.930
 not as it is now 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.750
 I jumped to 87, but I found 70 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.010
 is optimal 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.769
 that should be on the bottom like that now 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.170
 I do not know in German 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:04.390
 and color mode should definitely be 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.950
 On a make the colors then 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.130
 just look stronger and have more contrast 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.239
 have now the graphics quality many 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.910
 of course want a nice graphics 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:15.489
 play and that all looks good though 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.440
 as soon as it hits the first ball or that 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.569
 first e cell match is actually going 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.890
 Irrelevant if explosion look beautiful 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.410
 but there it is more important that you 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.170
 have many frames and all that nice 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.450
 you can run fast in general 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.880
 Actually , just turn off everything 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.410
 mesh quality or guitar quality im 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.200
 German you should on ultra or 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.930
 raise the tara quality on lolo 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.450
 anti aging post anti avenue are both 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:46.540
 on from the annes profi filter on 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:51.000
 one and collages on it yes that was it 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:53.780
 actually to the settings 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.900
 I speak that way again 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.450
 and there is the so-called user cfg 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.130
 which gives you more frames I will 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.660
 I'll just pack it in below 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.750
 but another extra tutorial we the 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:08.690
 and what commands are there exactly 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:11.540
 be applied so now for the second 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.780
 point the right movement so you 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.579
 See if I run on a spot 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.590
 then I usually jump one is 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.690
 just faster when you jump and 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.980
 that should be the same way then 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.110
 not all the time you or will 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.639
 slower you can see here but also 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.220
 Run for a short while 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.480
 of course you have to jump like that 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.050
 right rhythm for yourself 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.970
 Find 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.410
 then there are still small disputes 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.910
 whether you like in for example 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.300
 counter-strike with the knife faster 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.400
 is 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.860
 I think others say no but 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.330
 if you just rush on a stain 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.160
 which is not yet taken 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.900
 in a brothel is already recommended 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.600
 but you should use the knife to run 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.120
 synonymous in time for your primary 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:55.130
 Change weapon or second 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:56.660
 weapon well then what I think 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.590
 to a very important point is the 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.750
 to move back and fourth 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.750
 so if you for example at a corner 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.100
 if you look out and shoot 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.900
 you are obviously a very light 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:09.320
 You should aim for that as much as possible 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:11.539
 small small field of view have so to 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.680
 example only the small corner and always 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:14.840
 increase a bit more 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.330
 and if he is in a corner for example 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.710
 is or even if you now before one 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.150
 opponent is always moving back and forth 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.630
 that makes it harder for you 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.520
 to meet 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:26.240
 So I'm the street now easy 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.440
 here and very important in my opinion 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.440
 Anyway if you are at a corner 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.310
 is directly a medi packs down then 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.250
 regenerate yourself when you are 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.510
 So you are shot when we live 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.310
 Now there's an adversary behind 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:40.690
 and then I move so the whole 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:45.860
 always move fast and fast 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:47.810
 and then I'll shoot you see 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.140
 my hit I have now actually 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:54.800
 which controls the recall badly 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:56.539
 but well it went as premium sponsor yes 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.010
 then the right weapons and the 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:00.350
 essays you see here is with me 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:03.890
 it hit a 16 3 with a front heavy 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:06.420
 barrel and the reflex visor 

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:08.100
 Generally , of course, with those 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:10.380
 Weapons play the best you are 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:14.310
 or handle them but can grad 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:16.830
 if it goes into the esl or against 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:19.080
 opponents have the esl experience you are 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.730
 with pws for example or looks really 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.400
 not competitive because of that recommends 

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:27.440
 to take the 16 a 3 in the 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:30.900
 sixteen 4 dm 416 or the ak 9 71 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.640
 should also aim at big or 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.830
 dispense wide zoom 

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.900
 the best is finally the reflex and that 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:39.840
 cobra but also the holographic visor 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:43.100
 is still quite good but the ag 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.850
 For example, you should avoid 

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.760
 Finally I would like to say now 

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:51.660
 Of course that's just tips and stuff 

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:53.370
 no bucket 1 recipe with her immediately 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.780
 but if he gets the tips 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:58.590
 followed and also a bit on 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:07:00.090
 public exercises then I think that time 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:01.770
 her after a while already one 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.540
 notice significant improvement 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.790
 So just with the back and 

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:09.750
 moving in corners actually helps 

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:10.560
 Of course you have to do that anyway 

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:13.520
 practice goal 

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:15.660
 It is actually optimal with 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.620
 storm rifles or carbines always on 

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.380
 to aim the breast 

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:21.360
 because yes then by the recall that not 

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:23.760
 You can mostly control completely 

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.950
 The head comes at the end and thus has that 

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:28.020
 best hit and on big 

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:35.760
 Of course, coverage should also be in 

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:37.560
 Seiffen shoot and in general, for example 

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.540
 maps how bazaar these blocks are here 

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.880
 as a little tip always very helpful 

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:44.070
 because they are just indestructible 

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.260
 right there in front of the block if he then 

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:47.700
 here in the banana gang looks in and 

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:50.160
 here is on the block and you always 

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:54.120
 beautiful and moving then you think 

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:55.950
 because some kills could get the water 

00:07:54.120 --> 00:08:00.030
 I will also be here for you at the end of the day 

00:07:55.950 --> 00:08:02.730
 still incorporate our clan page and that 

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:05.790
 tutorial how to insert the user tfg 

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:09.770
 and what commands are in there 

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:09.770
 this beautiful day and shoot still
