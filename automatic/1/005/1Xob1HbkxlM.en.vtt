air sweeper so you guys this was

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:07.880 
air sweeper so you guys this was
actually<00:00:06.779> going<00:00:07.020> to<00:00:07.170> be<00:00:07.290> called<00:00:07.589> the<00:00:07.740> air

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
actually going to be called the air

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.620 
actually going to be called the air
mortar<00:00:08.370> but<00:00:08.550> for<00:00:08.760> some<00:00:08.940> reason<00:00:09.269> they<00:00:09.599> changed

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
mortar but for some reason they changed

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.720 
mortar but for some reason they changed
the<00:00:10.080> name<00:00:10.260> and<00:00:10.290> now<00:00:10.620> we<00:00:10.679> have<00:00:10.980> it<00:00:11.130> called<00:00:11.550> the

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
the name and now we have it called the

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.240 
the name and now we have it called the
air<00:00:11.880> sweeper<00:00:12.360> so<00:00:12.809> we<00:00:12.929> have<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.139> level<00:00:13.590> 6<00:00:13.950> on<00:00:14.190> a

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
air sweeper so we have a level 6 on a

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.709 
air sweeper so we have a level 6 on a
townhall<00:00:14.820> 10<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.330> it's<00:00:15.450> going<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.599> be

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
townhall 10 and it's going to be

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.810 
townhall 10 and it's going to be
demonstrating<00:00:16.350> how<00:00:16.500> it<00:00:16.680> works<00:00:16.920> against<00:00:17.640> some

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
demonstrating how it works against some

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.970 
demonstrating how it works against some
of<00:00:17.850> these<00:00:17.970> troops<00:00:18.300> we<00:00:18.630> have<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:19.050> minion<00:00:19.470> lava

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
of these troops we have a minion lava

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.859 
of these troops we have a minion lava
hound<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.609> dragon<00:00:21.029> as<00:00:21.180> well<00:00:21.210> as<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.539> balloon

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
hound and a dragon as well as a balloon

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.259 
hound and a dragon as well as a balloon
now<00:00:22.740> if<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:22.920> notice<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.699> balloon<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.150> getting

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
now if you notice the balloon is getting

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.179 
now if you notice the balloon is getting
the<00:00:24.480> worst<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.900> it<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.140> it's<00:00:25.560> pushing<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:25.980> back

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
the worst of it and it's pushing it back

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.640 
the worst of it and it's pushing it back
further<00:00:26.519> but<00:00:26.820> this<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.539> basically<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.170> balanced

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
further but this is basically a balanced

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.439 
further but this is basically a balanced
change<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.310> some<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.789> air<00:00:29.939> attacks<00:00:30.300> that

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
change to some of the air attacks that

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.150 
change to some of the air attacks that
we're<00:00:30.630> getting<00:00:30.720> if<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.109> notice<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.650> lot<00:00:32.130> of

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
we're getting if you notice a lot of

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.040 
we're getting if you notice a lot of
champion<00:00:32.910> players<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.390> high-level<00:00:33.540> players

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
champion players and high-level players

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.720 
champion players and high-level players
are<00:00:34.230> using<00:00:34.500> nothing<00:00:34.649> but<00:00:34.829> air<00:00:35.010> tubes<00:00:35.309> so<00:00:35.520> this

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
are using nothing but air tubes so this

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.090 
are using nothing but air tubes so this
is<00:00:35.880> probably<00:00:36.270> just<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.899> balance<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.530> change<00:00:37.890> the

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
is probably just a balance to change the

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.310 
is probably just a balance to change the
tide<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:38.790> now<00:00:38.969> we<00:00:39.030> have<00:00:39.149> more<00:00:39.600> people

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
tide so that now we have more people

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.049 
tide so that now we have more people
using<00:00:40.680> ground<00:00:40.950> units<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.790> just<00:00:41.969> the

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
using ground units and it just the

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.810 
using ground units and it just the
balances<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.690> out<00:00:42.920> so<00:00:43.920> we<00:00:44.160> can<00:00:44.340> see<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.670> it

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
balances it out so we can see that it

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.279 
balances it out so we can see that it
actually<00:00:45.000> can<00:00:45.270> rotate<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.840> can<00:00:45.989> put<00:00:46.200> it

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
actually can rotate you can put it

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.020 
actually can rotate you can put it
anywhere<00:00:46.530> in<00:00:46.710> your<00:00:46.829> base<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.280> I'm<00:00:47.820> really

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
anywhere in your base and I'm really

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.660 
anywhere in your base and I'm really
excited<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.600> see<00:00:48.809> how<00:00:49.170> many<00:00:49.489> people<00:00:50.489> are<00:00:50.550> going

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
excited to see how many people are going

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.189 
excited to see how many people are going
to<00:00:50.760> use<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.420> their<00:00:51.539> advantage<00:00:51.600> if

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
to use this to their advantage if

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.750 
to use this to their advantage if
they're<00:00:52.440> gonna<00:00:52.590> change<00:00:53.250> up<00:00:53.399> their<00:00:53.550> base

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
they're gonna change up their base

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.900 
they're gonna change up their base
designs<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.739> formulate<00:00:55.739> some<00:00:55.949> sort<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.340> new

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
designs and formulate some sort of new

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.029 
designs and formulate some sort of new
defense<00:00:57.449> strategy<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:58.140> put<00:00:58.379> this<00:00:58.559> thing<00:00:58.800> in

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
defense strategy to put this thing in

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.430 
defense strategy to put this thing in
there<00:00:59.480> so<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.629> it's<00:01:00.780> centered<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.379> that

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
there so that it's centered and that

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.500 
there so that it's centered and that
it's<00:01:01.920> protecting<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.579> because<00:01:02.699> we<00:01:03.000> only<00:01:03.239> get

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
it's protecting you because we only get

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.230 
it's protecting you because we only get
one<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.080> know<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.589> this<00:01:05.339> was<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.610> level<00:01:05.909> 6

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
one that I know of this was a level 6

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.480 
one that I know of this was a level 6
and<00:01:06.450> they<00:01:06.600> haven't<00:01:06.840> really<00:01:07.229> told<00:01:07.409> me<00:01:07.710> on<00:01:07.950> what

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
and they haven't really told me on what

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.250 
and they haven't really told me on what
level<00:01:08.880> we're<00:01:09.000> gonna<00:01:09.119> get<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.510> or<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.750> stats<00:01:10.049> it

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
level we're gonna get it or the stats it

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.840 
level we're gonna get it or the stats it
doesn't<00:01:10.560> do<00:01:10.650> any<00:01:10.890> damage

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
doesn't do any damage

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.840 
doesn't do any damage
it<00:01:12.240> doesn't<00:01:12.659> do<00:01:12.920> it's<00:01:13.920> not<00:01:14.100> like<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.280> weapon<00:01:14.700> it

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
it doesn't do it's not like a weapon it

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.660 
it doesn't do it's not like a weapon it
just<00:01:15.540> pushes<00:01:15.780> troops<00:01:16.200> back<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:17.130> it's<00:01:17.310> just<00:01:17.520> to

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
just pushes troops back and it's just to

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.100 
just pushes troops back and it's just to
balance<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:18.119> stuff<00:01:18.360> out<00:01:18.540> but<00:01:18.720> I'm<00:01:18.840> really

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
balance this stuff out but I'm really

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.590 
balance this stuff out but I'm really
glad<00:01:19.229> we<00:01:19.500> have<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.250> it's<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.939> good<00:01:21.299> change

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
glad we have this and it's a good change

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.539 
glad we have this and it's a good change
that<00:01:21.840> we<00:01:21.930> do<00:01:22.110> need<00:01:22.290> because<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.650> get<00:01:23.130> hammered

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
that we do need because I get hammered

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.130 
that we do need because I get hammered
pretty<00:01:23.939> bad<00:01:24.119> by<00:01:24.299> some<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.600> these<00:01:24.689> air<00:01:24.869> players

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
pretty bad by some of these air players

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.050 
pretty bad by some of these air players
and<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.130> can<00:01:26.250> see<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.490> doesn't<00:01:26.670> really<00:01:26.880> affect

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
and you can see it doesn't really affect

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.880 
and you can see it doesn't really affect
the<00:01:27.450> ground<00:01:27.689> units<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.110> spec<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.470> coming<00:01:28.770> in

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
the ground units the spec is coming in

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.679 
the ground units the spec is coming in
taking<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.280> loot<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.670> it's<00:01:29.970> only<00:01:30.180> pushing

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689
