twisted

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.290

then<00:00:19.680> join<00:00:20.189> these<00:00:20.430> two<00:00:20.609> ends<00:00:20.820> of<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.060> slip

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
then join these two ends of the slip

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.960 
then join these two ends of the slip
stitch<00:00:24.019> now<00:00:25.019> we'll<00:00:25.230> chain<00:00:25.529> one<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:26.519> in<00:00:26.730> each

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
stitch now we'll chain one and in each

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.599 
stitch now we'll chain one and in each
chain<00:00:27.359> we<00:00:27.779> are<00:00:27.900> going<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.260> make<00:00:28.500> one<00:00:28.920> circle

che

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.189 

so<00:00:46.859> keep<00:00:47.070> making<00:00:47.519> one<00:00:47.699> single<00:00:48.000> crochet<00:00:48.390> in

hook into the next chain draw loop and

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:17.760 
hook into the next chain draw loop and
then<00:02:07.479> we'll<00:02:07.690> change<00:02:08.110> the<00:02:08.560> yarn<00:02:13.230> chain<00:02:14.230> two<00:02:16.770> and

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
then we'll change the yarn chain two and

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.350 
then we'll change the yarn chain two and
right<00:02:17.980> here<00:02:18.280> in<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.459> same<00:02:18.760> chain<00:02:19.060> we<00:02:19.270> are

right here in the same chain we are

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:32.890 
right here in the same chain we are
going<00:02:19.600> to<00:02:19.720> make<00:02:19.930> four<00:02:20.470> double<00:02:20.830> crochets

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900

we have three double crochets Plus this

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.880 
we have three double crochets Plus this
two<00:02:37.640> chain<00:02:37.819> space<00:02:38.120> and<00:02:38.450> that<00:02:39.290> will<00:02:39.409> count<00:02:39.650> as<00:02:39.860> a

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
two chain space and that will count as a

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.670 
two chain space and that will count as a
one<00:02:40.250> double<00:02:40.519> crochet<00:02:40.819> two<00:02:41.030> so<00:02:41.470> then<00:02:42.470> when<00:02:42.650> you

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
one double crochet two so then when you

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.509 
one double crochet two so then when you
sort<00:02:42.920> of<00:02:42.950> hook<00:02:43.220> here<00:02:43.640> in<00:02:43.760> our<00:02:43.909> first<00:02:45.519> double

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
sort of hook here in our first double

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.899 
sort of hook here in our first double
crochet<00:02:48.159> instead<00:02:49.159> of<00:02:49.340> walking<00:02:49.610> through<00:02:49.790> this

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:49.909 
crochet instead of walking through this

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:55.330 
crochet instead of walking through this
loop<00:02:50.620> and<00:02:51.620> then<00:02:52.400> draw<00:02:52.909> out<00:02:53.769> then<00:02:54.769> we'll<00:02:55.069> skip

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
loop and then draw out then we'll skip

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.360 
loop and then draw out then we'll skip
one<00:02:55.579> chain<00:02:55.610> and<00:02:56.180> into<00:02:56.569> a<00:02:56.629> second<00:02:57.049> chain<00:02:57.370> we'll

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
one chain and into a second chain we'll

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:06.699 
one chain and into a second chain we'll
make<00:02:58.579> one<00:02:58.970> single<00:02:59.510> crochet<00:03:05.319> skip<00:03:06.319> one<00:03:06.680> chain

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
make one single crochet skip one chain

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.910 
make one single crochet skip one chain
and<00:03:07.250> into<00:03:07.549> a<00:03:07.609> second<00:03:08.030> chain<00:03:08.299> we'll<00:03:09.230> make<00:03:09.500> four

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
and into a second chain we'll make four

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:28.690 
and into a second chain we'll make four
double<00:03:10.280> crochets<00:03:22.390> and<00:03:23.390> before<00:03:23.959> I<00:03:27.609> said<00:03:28.609> I

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
double crochets and before I said I

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.000 
double crochets and before I said I
would<00:03:28.909> go<00:03:29.359> first<00:03:29.659> double<00:03:30.019> crochet<00:03:32.769> and<00:03:33.769> so<00:03:33.980> I

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
would go first double crochet and so I

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.800 
would go first double crochet and so I
walk<00:03:34.220> through<00:03:34.370> this<00:03:34.489> loop<00:03:34.760> and<00:03:35.120> then<00:03:35.480> draw<00:03:35.780> a

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
walk through this loop and then draw a

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.420 
walk through this loop and then draw a
loop<00:03:38.049> okay<00:03:39.049> and<00:03:39.260> then<00:03:39.530> we'll<00:03:39.889> skip<00:03:40.160> one<00:03:40.400> chain

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
loop okay and then we'll skip one chain

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.699 
loop okay and then we'll skip one chain
into<00:03:41.060> a<00:03:41.090> second<00:03:41.510> chain<00:03:41.720> make<00:03:42.230> one<00:03:42.470> single

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
into a second chain make one single

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:50.470 
into a second chain make one single
crochet<00:03:47.980> skip<00:03:48.980> one<00:03:49.310> chain<00:03:49.340> into<00:03:50.000> a<00:03:50.060> second

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:47.669 
single crochet in the next chain and

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:50.300 
single crochet in the next chain and
then<00:06:48.330> we'll<00:06:48.509> make<00:06:48.750> one<00:06:49.080> single<00:06:49.289> crochet<00:06:49.860> in

then we'll make one single crochet in

00:06:50.310 --> 00:07:03.070 
then we'll make one single crochet in
each<00:06:50.669> chain<00:06:50.729> after<00:06:51.419> that

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.080 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.969 

and<00:07:03.680> so<00:07:03.919> we<00:07:04.159> will<00:07:04.400> repeat<00:07:04.819> this<00:07:05.979> throughout
