00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
now so it's gonna be a little bit easier

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:34.690 
now so it's gonna be a little bit easier

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
you faced him now if you take a look at

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.490 
you faced him now if you take a look at
at<00:01:37.130> resumes<00:01:37.460> layout<00:01:38.210> here<00:01:38.479> he<00:01:38.689> has<00:01:38.869> the<00:01:39.170> Sham

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
absorbed chance when it comes to bullets

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:53.950 
absorbed chance when it comes to bullets
fire<00:01:52.400> to<00:01:52.520> you<00:01:52.670> what<00:01:53.150> that<00:01:53.299> means<00:01:53.540> is<00:01:53.780> like

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
fire to you what that means is like

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.730 
fire to you what that means is like
mines<00:01:54.340> 94%<00:01:55.340> absorb<00:01:55.790> chance<00:01:56.560> 94%<00:01:57.560> of<00:01:57.650> the

mines 94% absorb chance 94% of the

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.740 
mines 94% absorb chance 94% of the
bullets<00:01:58.130> fired<00:01:58.400> I<00:01:58.549> mean<00:01:58.729> my<00:01:58.880> shield<00:01:59.390> is<00:01:59.600> going

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
bullets fired I mean my shield is going

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.390 
bullets fired I mean my shield is going
to<00:01:59.960> absorb<00:02:00.079> and<00:02:00.439> it's<00:02:00.560> not<00:02:00.680> going<00:02:00.829> to<00:02:01.040> do<00:02:01.189> any

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
to absorb and it's not going to do any

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.219 
to absorb and it's not going to do any
damage<00:02:01.610> to<00:02:01.790> it<00:02:02.090> whatsoever

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229

so<00:02:03.560> he's<00:02:03.770> doing<00:02:04.009> exactly<00:02:04.130> the<00:02:04.670> same<00:02:04.850> thing

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
so he's doing exactly the same thing

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.880 
so he's doing exactly the same thing
that<00:02:05.240> I<00:02:05.299> do<00:02:05.570> using<00:02:06.079> the<00:02:06.200> Sham<00:02:06.470> show

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
that I do using the Sham show

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.290 
that I do using the Sham show
going<00:02:07.159> through<00:02:07.370> here<00:02:07.580> because<00:02:07.880> there's<00:02:08.179> a<00:02:08.270> lot

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
going through here because there's a lot

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.570 
going through here because there's a lot
of<00:02:08.539> enemies<00:02:08.869> firing<00:02:09.229> bullets<00:02:09.530> at<00:02:09.619> you<00:02:09.679> if<00:02:10.520> you

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
of enemies firing bullets at you if you

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.400 
of enemies firing bullets at you if you
use<00:02:10.850> the<00:02:11.000> B<00:02:11.180> shield<00:02:11.510> you<00:02:11.690> know<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:11.930> capacity

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
use the B shield you know the capacity

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.930 
use the B shield you know the capacity
is<00:02:12.500> usually<00:02:12.800> pretty<00:02:13.010> low<00:02:13.220> and<00:02:13.430> it<00:02:13.550> goes<00:02:13.730> down

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
is usually pretty low and it goes down

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.600 
is usually pretty low and it goes down
pretty<00:02:14.270> rapidly<00:02:14.680> so<00:02:15.680> I<00:02:15.709> prefer<00:02:16.010> to<00:02:16.310> use<00:02:16.340> the

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
pretty rapidly so I prefer to use the

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.910 
pretty rapidly so I prefer to use the
sham<00:02:16.850> like<00:02:17.240> like<00:02:17.660> he's<00:02:17.840> doing<00:02:17.959> right<00:02:18.230> here<00:02:18.410> he

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.910 
does something a little bit different
than<00:02:20.270> I<00:02:20.360> do<00:02:20.420> he<00:02:20.690> kept<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.080> sham<00:02:21.319> on<00:02:21.350> the<00:02:21.650> entire

so<00:03:34.190> whit<00:03:34.400> got<00:03:34.610> a<00:03:34.640> level<00:03:34.880> 50<00:03:35.269> version<00:03:35.630> of<00:03:35.720> this

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
so whit got a level 50 version of this

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.660 
so whit got a level 50 version of this
and<00:03:36.110> you<00:03:36.620> know<00:03:36.709> both<00:03:36.950> of<00:03:37.010> them<00:03:37.250> are<00:03:37.400> about<00:03:37.459> the

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
and you know both of them are about the

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.390 
and you know both of them are about the
same<00:03:37.910> same<00:03:38.239> stats<00:03:38.510> 10,000<00:03:39.320> damage<00:03:39.980> stuff<00:03:40.220> like

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
same same stats 10,000 damage stuff like

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.130 
same same stats 10,000 damage stuff like
that<00:03:40.610> but<00:03:41.269> I<00:03:41.299> think<00:03:41.630> it's<00:03:41.750> a<00:03:41.810> pretty<00:03:41.989> cool

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
that but I think it's a pretty cool

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.630 
that but I think it's a pretty cool
pistol<00:03:42.590> man<00:03:42.739> the<00:03:42.890> fire<00:03:43.100> rate<00:03:43.310> is<00:03:43.340> pretty

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
pistol man the fire rate is pretty

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.130 
pistol man the fire rate is pretty
decent<00:03:43.820> as<00:03:44.060> well<00:03:44.209> you<00:03:44.269> can<00:03:44.420> see<00:03:44.540> me<00:03:44.660> rack<00:03:44.840> up<00:03:45.019> a

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
decent as well you can see me rack up a

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.500 
decent as well you can see me rack up a
couple<00:03:45.410> shots<00:03:45.680> there<00:03:45.980> but<00:03:46.790> it's<00:03:47.000> definitely<00:03:47.239> a

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
couple shots there but it's definitely a

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.530 
couple shots there but it's definitely a
pistol<00:03:48.049> that's<00:03:48.230> pretty<00:03:48.530> I<00:03:49.130> would<00:03:49.730> farm<00:03:50.150> for<00:03:50.390> it

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
pistol that's pretty I would farm for it
