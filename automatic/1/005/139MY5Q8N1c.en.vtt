00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.299
 Here 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:33.650

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.880
 Yes 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.500

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.610
 Blue Doo 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.409

 I thought it was good 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:34.470
 And 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:37.410
