pointed polishing my favorite aspect of
the<00:00:21.539> elite<00:00:21.750> series<00:00:22.050> would<00:00:22.439> be<00:00:22.500> on<00:00:22.949> all<00:00:23.220> the

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
the elite series would be on all the

the elite series would be on all the
Profi<00:00:23.730> cuffs<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.210> can<00:00:24.420> actually<00:00:24.660> polish<00:00:25.439> with

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
Profi cuffs you can actually polish with

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.769 
Profi cuffs you can actually polish with
the<00:00:25.710> external<00:00:26.369> ridges<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.119> allows<00:00:27.359> for

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
the external ridges and that allows for

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.550 
the external ridges and that allows for
superior<00:00:28.439> stain<00:00:28.800> removal<00:00:29.340> easier<00:00:29.880> access

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
superior stain removal easier access

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.350 
superior stain removal easier access
maneuverability<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:31.949> it's<00:00:32.130> very<00:00:32.550> convenient

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
maneuverability so it's very convenient

benefits of the external ridges on the
elite<00:00:42.149> cup<00:00:42.450> would<00:00:43.079> be<00:00:43.260> superior<00:00:43.739> stain

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
elite cup would be superior stain

they're harder to access the external
ridges<00:00:51.600> are<00:00:51.750> really<00:00:52.079> beneficial<00:00:52.530> in<00:00:52.829> those

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
ridges are really beneficial in those

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.250 
ridges are really beneficial in those
locations<00:00:53.370> increased<00:00:54.210> splatter<00:00:54.539> control<00:00:54.989> as

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
locations increased splatter control as

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.290 
locations increased splatter control as

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
well as superior maneuverability the

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.330 
well as superior maneuverability the
elite<00:01:00.539> flex<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:01.289> different<00:01:01.800> from<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.070> elite

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
elite flex is different from the elite

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.870 
elite flex is different from the elite
original<00:01:02.879> because<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.629> 25%<00:01:04.500> softer<00:01:05.220> this

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
original because it is 25% softer this

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.030 
original because it is 25% softer this
allows<00:01:06.210> for<00:01:06.240> slightly<00:01:06.900> more<00:01:07.049> flex<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.770> flair

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
allows for slightly more flex and flair

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.580 
allows for slightly more flex and flair
this<00:01:08.430> extra<00:01:08.909> flare<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.570> flex<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.290> better

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
this extra flare and flex is better

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.219 
this extra flare and flex is better
because<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.640> allows<00:01:11.970> for<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.689> cup<00:01:13.020> to

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
because it allows for the cup to

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.590 
because it allows for the cup to
actually<00:01:13.770> maneuver<00:01:14.250> around<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.299> natural

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
actually maneuver around the natural

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.870 
actually maneuver around the natural
contours<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.560> each<00:01:16.680> tooth<00:01:17.009> if<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.580> like<00:01:17.729> the

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
contours of each tooth if you like the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.120 
contours of each tooth if you like the
flare<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.479> elite<00:01:18.930> flex<00:01:19.290> but<00:01:19.740> prefer<00:01:20.100> a

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
flare of the elite flex but prefer a

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.429 
flare of the elite flex but prefer a
longer<00:01:20.369> cuff<00:01:20.759> then<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.450> elite<00:01:21.720> extend<00:01:22.200> flex

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
longer cuff then the elite extend flex

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.410 
longer cuff then the elite extend flex
is<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.860> choice<00:01:23.070> freedom<00:01:23.400> both<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:24.090> them<00:01:24.210> have

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
is the choice freedom both of them have

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.719 
is the choice freedom both of them have
the<00:01:24.570> advantage<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.650> increased<00:01:26.159> flex<00:01:26.520> and

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
the advantage of increased flex and

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.390 
the advantage of increased flex and
