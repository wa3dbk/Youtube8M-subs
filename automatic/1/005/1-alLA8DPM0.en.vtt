then I can pick it off and just easily

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.160 
then I can pick it off and just easily
pour<00:01:10.410> it<00:01:10.500> into<00:01:10.800> the<00:01:10.920> mixer<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:12.090> sometimes<00:01:12.930> you

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
pour it into the mixer and sometimes you

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.590 
pour it into the mixer and sometimes you
get<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.350> couple<00:01:13.650> little<00:01:14.280> bumps<00:01:14.850> on<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.210> bottom

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.719 
get a couple little bumps on the bottom

and it usually just press those through
with<00:01:17.910> my<00:01:18.090> hand<00:01:18.390> so<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.810> have<00:01:18.930> all<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.500> my<00:01:19.680> sugar

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
with my hand so I have all of my sugar

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.550 
with my hand so I have all of my sugar
for<00:01:20.369> my<00:01:20.490> recipe<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.900> we're<00:01:22.050> going<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.259> start

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
for my recipe so we're going to start

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.820 
for my recipe so we're going to start
our<00:01:22.740> mixer<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.369> then<00:01:23.490> add<00:01:23.759> our<00:01:23.790> sugar<00:01:24.180> slowly

any higher it could really get all over
your<00:02:00.959> kitchen<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.649> then<00:02:01.770> your<00:02:02.100> recipe<00:02:02.580> won't

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:03.929 
be accurate either

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:06.469 
be accurate either
so<00:02:04.619> after<00:02:05.100> this<00:02:05.310> mixes<00:02:05.759> in<00:02:05.940> a<00:02:05.970> little<00:02:06.330> bit

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
so after this mixes in a little bit

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.419 
so after this mixes in a little bit
we'll<00:02:06.660> go<00:02:06.810> ahead<00:02:06.959> and<00:02:07.470> add<00:02:07.709> the<00:02:07.920> rest<00:02:08.130> of<00:02:08.310> the

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
we'll go ahead and add the rest of the

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.690 
we'll go ahead and add the rest of the
sugar<00:02:09.470> hey<00:02:10.470> I'm<00:02:10.590> going<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:10.920> go<00:02:11.069> ahead<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.580> add

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
sugar hey I'm going to go ahead and add

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.949 
sugar hey I'm going to go ahead and add
my<00:02:11.940> cream<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:13.280> then<00:02:14.280> my<00:02:14.580> vanilla<00:02:15.000> I'm<00:02:15.600> going

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
my cream and then my vanilla I'm going

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.960 
my cream and then my vanilla I'm going
to<00:02:16.080> mix<00:02:16.230> this<00:02:16.470> for<00:02:16.770> a<00:02:16.800> few<00:02:17.130> minutes<00:02:17.520> so<00:02:17.640> it

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
to mix this for a few minutes so it

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.240 
to mix this for a few minutes so it
aerates<00:02:18.450> just<00:02:18.840> going<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.250> become

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
aerates just going to become

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.230 
aerates just going to become
incorporated

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
incorporated

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:30.360 
incorporated
going<00:02:22.420> to<00:02:22.510> become<00:02:22.780> lighter<00:02:23.080> in<00:02:23.410> color

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.089 

before<00:02:30.940> I<00:02:30.970> let<00:02:31.300> it<00:02:31.450> go<00:02:31.690> for<00:02:32.170> too<00:02:32.410> long<00:02:32.620> I<00:02:32.890> want

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
before I let it go for too long I want

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.640 
before I let it go for too long I want
to<00:02:33.220> start<00:02:33.519> scraping<00:02:34.030> it<00:02:34.420> down<00:02:34.690> so<00:02:35.440> I'm<00:02:35.500> going

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
to start scraping it down so I'm going

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.369 
to start scraping it down so I'm going
to<00:02:35.769> scrape<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.250> edges<00:02:36.760> so<00:02:37.629> I<00:02:37.690> can<00:02:37.900> get<00:02:38.110> my

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
to scrape the edges so I can get my

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.710 
to scrape the edges so I can get my
powdered<00:02:38.830> sugar<00:02:39.310> and<00:02:39.610> maybe<00:02:39.760> any<00:02:40.090> lumps<00:02:40.540> of

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
powdered sugar and maybe any lumps of

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.830 
powdered sugar and maybe any lumps of
butter<00:02:40.750> off<00:02:41.709> the<00:02:42.129> bottom<00:02:42.610> or<00:02:42.819> the<00:02:42.849> edges<00:02:43.450> and

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
butter off the bottom or the edges and

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.470 
butter off the bottom or the edges and
this<00:02:44.590> just<00:02:44.890> helps<00:02:45.250> your<00:02:45.400> mix<00:02:45.700> incorporate

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
this just helps your mix incorporate

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.770 
this just helps your mix incorporate
butter<00:02:46.780> and<00:02:47.230> it's<00:02:47.769> good<00:02:48.010> to<00:02:48.330> scrape<00:02:49.330> the<00:02:49.569> bowl

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
butter and it's good to scrape the bowl

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.380 
butter and it's good to scrape the bowl

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
down with a rubber spatula like this one

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.059 
down with a rubber spatula like this one
with<00:02:52.599> a<00:02:52.629> handle<00:02:53.140> on<00:02:53.260> it<00:02:53.500> they<00:02:53.650> work<00:02:53.830> pretty

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
with a handle on it they work pretty

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.970 
with a handle on it they work pretty
good<00:02:54.190> for<00:02:54.370> doing<00:02:54.730> that<00:02:55.090> so<00:02:55.660> knowing<00:02:56.110> that

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.160

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
curve a few minutes until it aerates

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.080 
curve a few minutes until it aerates
