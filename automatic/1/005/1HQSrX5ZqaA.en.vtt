00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:18.320
 hello everyone this video is a request 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.840
 What did a girl Maria Jose do? 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.020
 leaked pieces here on youtube she 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.630
 I wanted a black design using 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.270
 strips and that had areas with brightness 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.700
 and matt zones 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.670
 I 'm going to do it with enamels 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:36.280
 permanent and good we start putting 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.610
 a cap of black enamel throughout 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.610
 a 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:51.400
 and when we have it we can cure it in 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.400
 lamp for two minutes 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.930
 when we take out the lamp we give a 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.930
 second capita 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.070
 and we put other lamps in the lamp 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.830
 two minutes 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.820
 when we have it cleaned with a 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.820
 alcohol booth 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:18.950
 now we take a piece of tape in 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:22.220
 this case of silver and we put it in 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:25.450
 diagonal on the nail 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.789
 we stick well on the edges 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.689
 and we take another bit and put it 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:30.689
 parallel to this 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.200
 now we put our gel shine 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:45.380
 final and when we have it we put the 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.840
 lamp for 4 minutes 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.579
 we clean again but this time what 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.170
 We do with Kleenex to not lose the 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.170
 top coat shine 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.700
 and with pliers we are going to cut the 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.700
 excess ribbon 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.090
 with a polishing billet I will pass it a 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.750
 little bit where we cut the 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.640
 band to soften that area now 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.230
 I'm going to hit a bit of zeal for 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.550
 where we have put the band to 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.550
 Separate two areas on the nail 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:37.969
 with a matte topcoat we are going to apply it 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.969
 in the area that has been free of zeal 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.860
 ah 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.660
 when it has dried a little 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.090
 we withdraw the zeal 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.310
 and with another bit a little thinner what 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.190
 we put right between the two tapes to 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.950
 separate another part in the lower area 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.820
 of the nail to also apply the top 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.820
 matte coat 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:10.570
 when we have it, we retire the zeal 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:14.140
 and we would have the finished design is 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:16.010
 very simple but at the same time I see it very 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.989
 elegant too 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.659
 I hope you liked mari jose 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:24.579
 I hope you liked them all and we 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:24.579
 we see in the next video goodbye
