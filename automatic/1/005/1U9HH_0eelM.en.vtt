00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:06.039
 and good as much as it weighs on 

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:08.650
 users of xbox one the truth is that 

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:11.590
 once again playstation 4 returns to 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:14.650
 put a goal in terms of technique to xbox 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.690
 one and we talk about the video game has a 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.240
 title that reaches us at the end of this 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.990
 Same month on February 28 you know 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.300
 that goes on sale 10 that new version 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.480
 of that saga in which our maxim 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.130
 priority is to steal without being detected 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.840
 so to speak square enix has 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.700
 confirmed the resolution and rate of 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.410
 images per second that you're going to 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.660
 work 10 on the new consoles 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.540
 generation in playstation 4 the game goes 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.340
 to have a resolution of 1080p while 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.500
 that in xbox one will only reach 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.290
 the 900 p therefore there will be a 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.700
 rescued up to 1080p both 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.790
 versions are going to have a rate of 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:54.520
 images per second of 30 frames per 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:58.120
 second so only the users 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:01.020
 of pc are going to be those that can say 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.839
 play at this 10 to 60 frames per second 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.990
 because it will be this let's say limitations 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.970
 playstation 4 and xbox one techniques 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.990
 at the time of moving this title to 60 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.090
 frames per second 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.760
 it will really be because you have to remember 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.650
 that 10 was a title thought from a 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.180
 first moment for pc that then already 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.689
 he was saying that he was going to appear too 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.729
 in good consoles we'll see why 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.470
 attentive because nicolás cantín director 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.720
 of the game has said really you need 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.280
 good eyes to see the difference 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.590
 between the xbox one version and 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.729
 playstation 4 the version of both 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.920
 consoles are very good both versions 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.600
 there are hardly any differences between the two 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.619
 wanted to emphasize this is true and I say 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.500
 because then there are many people who say 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.450
 because you say there is so much difference 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.740
 there is not so much no in this case it is true 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.750
 who have said that there will not be so many 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:54.220
 differences but there you have the data 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.990
 1080p in playstation 4 900 p in xbox one 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.119
 I already say it depends on what television 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.180
 juguéis if you play on TV not very 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.049
 large above 40 inches 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.280
 you will hardly notice 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.890
 this type of details 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.470
 but well there you have these new data 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.959
 of time that title that supposes as already 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.630
 you know the restart in that veteran saga 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:16.870
 so there you have another little game for 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.310
 later this month and another one 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.110
 new chapter in the battle between 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.110
 playstation 4 and xbox one
