started talking about why didn't he go

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.970 
started talking about why didn't he go
to<00:02:58.640> the<00:02:58.819> draft<00:02:59.090> said<00:02:59.750> that<00:02:59.959> causing<00:03:00.709> the<00:03:00.769> great

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
to the draft said that causing the great

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.680 
to the draft said that causing the great
experience<00:03:01.459> for<00:03:01.519> him<00:03:01.760> and<00:03:02.000> he<00:03:02.959> wants<00:03:03.079> to<00:03:03.260> stay

hopefully<00:03:05.410> just<00:03:05.650> keep<00:03:06.520> playing<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:06.850> way<00:03:06.880> the

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
hopefully just keep playing the way the

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.760 
hopefully just keep playing the way the
plane<00:03:07.390> so<00:03:08.020> I<00:03:08.080> think<00:03:08.170> that's<00:03:08.440> the<00:03:08.560> biggest

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
plane so I think that's the biggest

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.350 
plane so I think that's the biggest
thing<00:03:08.950> because<00:03:09.100> everyone's<00:03:09.700> talking<00:03:10.300> about

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
thing because everyone's talking about

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.380 
thing because everyone's talking about
one<00:03:10.840> and<00:03:10.990> done<00:03:11.110> chewing<00:03:11.320> done<00:03:11.650> well<00:03:12.430> I<00:03:12.880> think

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
one and done chewing done well I think

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:19.010 
one and done chewing done well I think
it's<00:03:13.660> great<00:03:13.750> that<00:03:13.870> he's<00:03:14.110> going<00:03:14.260> to<00:03:14.320> stay
