00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.360
 hello friends like I said in some 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.190
 many videos are the things that I 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.520
 like to say and little the time that 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.140
 have for this so some 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.660
 series of videos are staying a bit 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.970
 late but sometimes 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.120
 I prefer to meet the requirements of 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.070
 your letters so well lately I've 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.560
 received some emails in which I 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.560
 Jce requests some simple ritual to 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:46.489
 attract to attract stability 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:48.809
 economically so necessary nowadays 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.059
 Searching in my book of shadows 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.129
 he had written down a ritual of which 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.159
 work since there are sometimes 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.730
 rituals that I have most marked in 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:03.000
 the book as ineffective is a ritual 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.190
 I've used it a few times but 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.180
 whenever I have done it has created in me 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.100
 the necessary imprint to satisfy my 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.170
 wish 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.680
 a great friend taught me years ago 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:20.080
 my practitioner of the hollow religion is 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.890
 a ritual to which I am very fond 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:27.280
 I think more where does it come from than 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:30.060
 the ritual itself but before proceeding to 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.990
 detail how this ritual is performed 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.860
 allow me to give you a few 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.929
 advice you have to destroy the fear there 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.890
 two thoughts that block the flow 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:44.380
 of money fear do not have to not have 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.899
 money feeling that you are not one of the 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.420
 called to generate money 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:52.000
 Fear acts as a shield and above all 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.840
 rejects all opportunities that are 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.940
 they can present you when we meditate 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.770
 especially when we do it with the 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.490
 pineal gland and we focus our attention 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.289
 in something that something grows if we focus 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.739
 our attention in the fear of 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:11.140
 lack that lack will grow at 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:14.530
 So much attention has to be focused on 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.360
 pleasant feeling of abundance and 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.790
 get away from fear 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.610
 when we over come that feeling of 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.550
 fear just relax in the 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:28.390
 abundance and in the pleasant feeling 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:31.330
 of not having economic problems and away 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:35.050
 fear I know it can be difficult 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:37.960
 but trust in providence my father 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:41.620
 always said god will provide and at the end 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:44.760
 always provided to maintain the movement 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:48.280
 Money money belongings 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.800
 everything is in some way energy and like 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.410
 such has to be in movement of 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.920
 nothing serves to amass something either money or 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.720
 fortune belongings clothes shoes yes 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.790
 something you have not used in the last two 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.700
 years, most likely you do not go 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.560
 to use with which to give it away from that 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.290
 way you are leaving a gap for 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.850
 abundance that will come is as if 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.730
 you have the fridge full of food 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.420
 expired you will have to empty the 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.620
 Put what you have recently purchased 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.870
 You should also eliminate those 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.330
 thoughts that are part of the past 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.239
 and that they no longer serve you to make way for 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:28.630
 one or a few of freedom and 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:31.030
 prosperity empty your head of 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.600
 feelings of penury and anguish 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:38.140
 always to receive you the fullness and 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:41.489
 now let's execute this ritual for 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:44.170
 you need a white crystal glass 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:47.049
 preferably new or very clean and 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.420
 especially that this glass is not going to 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:52.440
 use nothing more than to run this 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:56.070
 ritual on the first Sunday of each month 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.530
 a white candle a handful of salt as I have 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.210
 said the first Sunday of every month 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.670
 Choose a quiet place in your house and 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:05.490
 that will always be the same where you 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:08.850
 every month you will do this ritual for 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:11.160
 money and prosperity to start 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.860
 On a little table you will light the candle 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.600
 white I advise you not to light the 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.000
 candle directly from the lighter 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.730
 If you do not have wooden matches, take a 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.130
 stick it on and turn it on 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.200
 candle you have the glass with water and you 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.210
 add a little salt leaving it to rest 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.880
 three hours 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:33.090
 After that time you wash your hands with 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.370
 that water repeating the money is my 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.170
 friend and it comes to me with balance and 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.840
 harmony 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:42.660
 then you pick up a glass and go all over the 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.750
 house wetting your hands on it and 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:48.690
 slightly splashing the rooms and 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.440
 keep repeating the money is my friend and 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:54.060
 come to me with balance and harmony 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.790
 When you have finished, wash again 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.040
 your hands with the rest of the water do not 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:01.640
 I know it's let it dry in alone 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.780
 then turn off the candle but without blowing 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:07.320
 just take advantage of that you have the 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:09.240
 wet hands to turn it off there's never 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.690
 to blow a candle that is used to 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.450
 a ritual you have to pay for it with your hand and 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.730
 that's all, but first of all, do not forget 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:22.250
 that the true power is in 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:22.250
 your inside until the next friends
