00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello with you alex day reason for this 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.450
 videos have become as always thousands 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.560
 comments and posts with one 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.360
 the only request 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.910
 alex show video how to install 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.370
 the eight and that at me already the toad presses that 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.190
 most users have a ios 8 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.130
 on the device and I don't have even more 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.410
 I was finished off and naturally brought on 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.869
 There are numerous withdrawals of this review. 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.220
 videos from popular video bloggers that 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.590
 for installation 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.560
 Be sure to register Judit 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.360
 of your device, and what else to edit, I 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.760
 Here are my two devices updated on 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.920
 eight without any registration did 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.320
 if you are eager to upgrade to 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.000
 its out of 8 so let's do this for 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.000
 free and without any problems 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.170
 I remind about ios 8 is available for the same 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.879
 a number of devices for which is available a 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.859
 its 7 except iphone 4 before 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.870
 go through some installations always 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.470
 I highly recommend backing up 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.630
 copies 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.409
 so that in case something goes 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.600
 not everything could be restored further 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.280
 We are going to download directly the file with the beta 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.500
 as last year recommend 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.439
 use a reputable site a m 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.630
 was sitting. com only here is wide 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.939
 the choice 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.430
 you need to select and download one of 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:28.159
 versions proposed and focus 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.049
 we will be on the device model for this 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.240
 We look at the back cover and ios 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:33.679
 devices model number for example model 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.460
 my ipad air 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:38.590
 and 1474 we go to the most important thing 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.810
 install the firmware on our gadget 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.860
 we connect the device in aytyuns we press 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.799
 refresh button 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.229
 clamped alt on mac and shift on windows 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.929
 select the file with the firmware click 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.659
 open after this refresh and further 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:55.549
 the installation will start take it away from you 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.799
 few precious minutes of yours 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.619
 time but you will be lucky 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:03.250
 which can test the functional 8 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.509
 versions of the mobile system from apple 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.269
 congratulations now you're happy 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.610
 new ios 8 beta 1 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:13.220
 there is something to look at fast 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.829
 access to contacts from the multitasking menu 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.900
 integration of shazam functionality into siri 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:19.849

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.750
 this update 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.120
 information for the faint of heart why am i 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.609
 I say because seeing the first bugs 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.470
 using for example as 0 reaction to 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:39.200
 pressing the home and power buttons 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.940
 or not the appearance of buttons for taking or 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.639
 call rejection when you someone 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.650
 after all this, many of 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:49.489
 you will spit and will want to go 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.530
 on stable and its with 711 or not yet 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.690
 precluded that at some point on 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.060

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.810

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.790
 devices 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.160
 but I personally have since 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.350

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.310

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.739
