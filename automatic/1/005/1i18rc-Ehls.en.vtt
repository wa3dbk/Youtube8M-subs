00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:08.280
 It's cool, we're here straight from 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.230
 piracicaba for last proof of bread 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.660
 A Canadian Heat Accelerated Here Bread 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.250
 in toronto receives us is the following sumo 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.150
 of cars already thinking about formative 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.920
 triangular 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.630
 Me and you face gerson gerson 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.859
 you face those who add more victories 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.750
 in the non-triangular leads to the scaling jct 6 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.550
 has the same motor even touch the same 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.949
 power the third is a bit more 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.969
 heavy in this anguish is this or is it mass 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.430
 I can not cheat but the troops stayed 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.110
 The proof is as follows: 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.579
 in the body loses it has to push until the 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.350
 cone and the people like us here 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.059
 never fry clutches when they are 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.020
 near the pneuzinho there has also 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:01:00.239
 not to hit the bumper though the 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:01:03.539
 Eastern tradition have already been lost again 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.070
 to listen I started to accept the idea already 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.260
 that the poor thing 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.119
 My reaction was very fast. It 's the 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.250
 next, it looks to be fair then every 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.530
 one goes once in each car 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.750
 Now you face Japan was 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.770
 in the third year and the third is all 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:27.610
 your 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:30.909
 Look at the l1 l12 rock you lose means 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.469
 The pachydermatous was made after 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.250
 He came to try to knock me down. He arrived. 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:40.390
 there before 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:50.829
 I do not know if the ballot box was really a voice and 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:53.380
 Looking at the feature here soon in turnip futon 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:55.119
 and still ran over a cone swimming was only 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.759
 a little plate here it's okay to mark 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.890
 also a small plaque Tomazelli all time 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:03.640
 world saw me here look I would like to 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:07.360
 say it's a clutch test more 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.360
 than robot 11 a little bit of 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.329
 reflected also in the time of the uergs and 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.560
 stays on the hand brake with it engaged 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:17.349
 then he goes ahead I think he is 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.950
 this sumo in good truth was a fighter 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.780
 from sumÃ´ 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.060
 I went to watch the first impact the 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.889
 face takes it fall pure physics but the 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.930
 same speed for the more you are 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:29.230
 with a lot of technique now who accompanied 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.730
 every episode saw that more that it has 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.069
 that I was screwed here in that 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.930
 They invented rule in metal but I 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.940
 I had a lot of fun . 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.010
 It was sensational to put the 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.170
 ranking guys who are also there 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.389
 lifting a racing wheel is something the 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.040
 people never imagined that I would do it and I think 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:46.480
 That galera also liked me a lot. 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.400
 I do not know if it was one of the daily 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.109
 people accelerated on recording days 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.700
 that people accelerated but certainly 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:53.500
 we we have fun but it is 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.019
 we like you so much if you like it 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.609
 leave your license and share the 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.889
 people reach more people should stay 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:01.599
 promote the most crazy challenges 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:03.940
 boss and calling the 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.620
 audience did not panic was already the 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.359
 winner of accelerated pam 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.579
 but ended up taking another gold to 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:11.579
 house also in the south of cars 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.740
 Guys, I think this is what Sumo is. 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:28.280
 first impact and the guy is america 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:28.280
 The first is that the pope is easy.
