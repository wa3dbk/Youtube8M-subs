00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.180
 I could not understand his own origin. 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.360
 what is it 

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.050
 What this heat that blast wants to move 

00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:10.620
 I wonder why 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.329
 this out of control 

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:13.699
 it's a typical 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:15.329
 the other Brazilians 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:18.109
 the process may not end up 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:21.109
 he will not understand 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.800
 the director the podium 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.840
 The area where you're thinking how I'm going to lose 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.840
 How can I let him? 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.020
 let's know official 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.450
 but the site news is proof of this 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.450
 five-time champion of the ghost world 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.720
 He does pick up the initial wave. 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.200
 Reginald Paizão 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.200
 in this brazilian 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.250
 can give the embrace of the master fans 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.520
 andré was the one who expanded with a goal from simão made a point of speaking in brazil 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.430
 January - the region 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.320
 the respect of the triple world champion of the Brazilian ayrton senna current 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.320

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.210
 the pomegranate crowd 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.210
 I send the Brazilian national anthem 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.220
 the staging 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:11.479
 three agencies 

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:13.819
 I'm English 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.819
 river - in the midst of malaria 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:39.770
 was elected senator 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.989
 and the cries of is champion is champion 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.679
 supporters and was brought in during the 

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:47.839
 of overalls 

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:49.929
 promotional sketches 

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:53.219
 with the helmet on the brazilian flag 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:55.529
 Caesar and a Spanish 

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:58.829
 will win who is the champion in the generation 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:01.089
 this fantastic formula 1 

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:04.549
 trophy already delivered 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:07.149
 the fans showed that they were not delivered 

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:08.489
 - let's travel 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.489
 the increase in aliquots 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:15.639
 Teixeira talks to me 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:21.039
 algeria 

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:24.039
 The scene goes over the goal. 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.599
 there will only be a fight there too 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.269
 to the cedant of the cba 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.269
 Reginald with the sun. 

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:36.619
 party with your goal 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:44.389
 but he's an athlete who left 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:47.389
 after a race of so many emotions 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:54.889
 to airton sena 

00:03:57.529 --> 00:03:59.069
 will leave the podium 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:00.449
 for its importance 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:03.449
 stayed by the track 

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:10.809
 real madrid green-yellow 

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:17.069
 where to play your colleague 

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:20.069
 I figured the fight to stay with them. 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:27.379
 I'm focused 

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:30.009
 You have to take the seal now to the press room. 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:32.270
 plate official review 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.159
 hence the beautiful image after the victory of sernache schumacher ships repeated 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:38.600
 alex zanardi's club 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.979
 senna is the leader 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:41.779
 world championship 

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:45.159
 16 points six points ahead of Alan Prost 

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:49.939
 the party of the reginaldo helm reginaldo that run a long time did not see a 

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:51.460
 race without formula 1 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.080
 was a beautiful race to the prize with the conversation with the cindacta 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.939
 in Tokyo practically assembled here from Elias we said at the beginning of the 

00:04:58.939 --> 00:04:59.860
 streaming 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.340
 On top of a declaration from the Senate, they wanted to quit trying to 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.669
 good joke from any of the riders in the front row will be to 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:11.669
 try to lead a few laps he did more than that 

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:16.479
 only with a price to combat the favorites being there in the right place in the 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:20.919
 right moment and this was a victory of those who are there always ready at the maximum 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:25.110
 teams doing this he ended up putting himself in the right place at the moment 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.990
 right to play right and win in the smallest failure of families willis failed and there 

00:05:30.989 --> 00:05:31.980
 I remember again 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.280
 other testimony 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.460
 of forks what he said 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.690
 to support the reporter the cabrini baton which is easier to miss a race 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.719
 even for those who are favorite aluísio sérgio rasera won 

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:46.180
 he takes all the merits 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.230
 there is great doubt great brazilian moment - he creates 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.210
 a lot of emotion 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.080
 aírton senna won the brazilian grand prix 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.550
 We're going back to Jajá again that interlagos and a lot of things still to roll. 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.969
 a lot of things to happen 

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:06.720
 for each match at the start sucks 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.100
 Do not you ever give up but the saw is talking 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.770
 now we'll see 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.770
 the world 

00:06:16.559 --> 00:06:19.529
 of course you are concentrated super concentrated in the race but in that 

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:22.599
 eventually you felt like it's not like that and no one takes me away 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.560
 earned in the last 60 ten laps of the end 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.289
 the lieutenant who collapsed on the river Orinoco who admitted 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:34.289
 so only a technical fault can get out of there 

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:36.119
 the only mistake 

00:06:36.119 --> 00:06:39.999
 but feels like an electronic fault or is it a lie after your boyfriend 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.570
 - the staff looks at each other during 

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:47.420
 twice these last six rounds of Felipe alves that the promoter will break 

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:52.039
 the exchange lock just lacked there I was very apprehensive then 

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:55.039
 and in the last 12 votes and ovidio pedro zilli time 

00:06:56.419 --> 00:07:00.850
 It was really intense that the band could get that whole crowd if it 

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:03.080
 just to lille olá senna senna 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.740
 I asked the team what mix of operations started on Tuesday the program has 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:08.449
 It is made 

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:10.219
 several things in common 

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:13.580
 for the second time I win here what is a problem and for the project 

00:07:13.579 --> 00:07:15.899
 Original article here. 

00:07:15.899 --> 00:07:20.329
 then our motorcycle with little vote for depression and hydraulics and the exchange 

00:07:20.329 --> 00:07:23.389
 where does italy work had the same problem of eye printing 

00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:27.529
 this is a fight only the bike slows down a lot had a lot of people on the rink dangers 

00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:31.800
 there I was without control of the senator who is hydraulic and I stayed there to 

00:07:31.799 --> 00:07:36.369
 again had a possible loss of new was what will make him the people were music 

00:07:36.369 --> 00:07:40.369
 of the loaded in the arms of the people to the senate but I took so much they want them 

00:07:40.369 --> 00:07:43.020
 dance but I want to dvd knock on the head 

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:46.020
 flee or even the two prosecutors 

00:07:46.679 --> 00:07:50.520
 If I had to go through this race I would be ready to start.
