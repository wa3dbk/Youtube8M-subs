 in post would also not be Wednesday 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.350
 because that's not possible I have not 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.329
 at all at all the time you 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.530
 turn videos I 'm sorry but 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.670
 do not worry you're going to have 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.620
 this video we are monday 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.039
 today and then you go a 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.379
 video 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.780
 Saturday and then it will resume the pace 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.820
 saturday wednesday and so here we are 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.350
 in fact not see everything again like 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.030
 before it's just that I do not have any 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.600
 everything they try to predict with the 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.250
 severe weather 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.900
 when I film and it was a quality 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.950
 rotten so it was really impossible 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.770
 to make a video with this 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.990
 quality really null brightness have 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.930
 crushed by the loons everywhere there was 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.460
 my father is on the roof in the process of 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.409
 to fix it so that it does not run out 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.250
 was making a boom boom a brief one 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.840
 disaster 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.880
 I preferred to make a video here 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.049
 now and be a little late but 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.100
 it's okay after it will be 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.810
 holidays and you will be able to enjoy 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.210
 when you have new videos 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.430
 on the channel then on September 13th I 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.310
 picked up the novel yesterday you will understand 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.990
 rebecca steed published by Ã‰ditions 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.880
 wait was involved in my industry 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.530
 for a while and I did not know 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.460
 absolutely not what to expect but he 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.290
 tempted me a lot 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.780
 why do not I say too much the 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.640
 title yesterday you'll understand it's true that 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.530
 if we think a little it is not logical 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.880
 because yesterday it was yesterday 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.520
 will understand it's the future 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.750
 so suddenly it's pretty enigmatic 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.649
 as a very mysterious title and 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.610
 history is just as important 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.860
 we go back in history and in 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.869
 miranda dating who is a young 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.700
 pretty normal girl she's still 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.840
 very smart I think for his age 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.000
 in any case and she is really 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.860
 endearing as a character he is worshiped 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.269
 I was really attached to her a lot 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.110
 other characters from elsewhere and at 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.930
 beginning of the book 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.250
 it speaks of his life simply then 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.110
 then she will discover a little 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.269
 mysterious paper with a word and she does not 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.380
 not understand too much the meaning and 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.970
 it's someone who tells him he's coming 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.500
 to save his best friend and for the 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.060
 save her too is she not understand 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.650
 too much and she will then receive 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.090
 other words so that worries me a little 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.830
 and it's on the com to base itself any 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.299
 the story so the whole adventure we're going 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.430
 follow his life and we will also follow this 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.569
 her kind of teeth quest because she 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.700
 does not understand where these little ones come from 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.799
 papers so really the book he is 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.660
 just excellent in some scenes 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.709
 it's really so funny because 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.060
 when she tells how she is so 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.880
 young that sometimes these sentences are 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.530
 super naive are super they are said 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.120
 like that without thinking and I find that 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.609
 a lot more fun finally when 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.680
 it's reflected and it's at times 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:02.569
 when she goes to tell us that there is the 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.040
 late and his city that sleeps under the 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.359
 mailbox and then that they 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.680
 have to stay in school by closing 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:08.299
 because there is a madman running naked 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.739
 in the streets she when she says it 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:10.280
 it's just hilarious and I found that 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.690
 awesome 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.700
 and also when she says phrases 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.440
 touching and well it's a thousand times more 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.870
 touching that we are a lot more 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.799
 moving that when it's an adult who 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.389
 tell me I guess 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.519
 in any case for me it gave me this 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:24.230
 impression and I found that really 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.670
 beautiful as reading when we read a 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.810
 novel that is very young and that we 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.220
 realize that eventually dropped 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.810
 all the more touching thinks and the more I 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.609
 then it's true that the style is 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.470
 still youth yes I repeat myself 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:34.459
 but I still found that very 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.900
 nice and I had a lot a lot 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.730
 peace but so this is a book that has me 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.470
 bigger overall because it's true 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.210
 that it's a youth book so suddenly 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.190
 there is certainly 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.980
 when I was less dictated by 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.060
 the story - thoroughly in it but it has 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.100
 still been a very good read 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.960
 with very pretty quote from very 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.420
 nice sentences I spent very good 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.640
 moments with this novel in my hands and 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.260
 I really love them and I will 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.120
 recommend a lot it's really a 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.010
 nice book a relaxing book I would say 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.080
 even here is pretty rare for the little 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.780
 anecdote actually it's finished gold i did 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.520
 read in all I had to read all that there 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.750
 all this big part in the middle I 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.340
 had to read at the doctor's because we had 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.020
 ate doctor I not if you know that 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.640
 me two hours ago waited suddenly 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.560
 I almost could finish my book in the 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.840
 doctor is great with the atmosphere and 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.000
 all sick or super here you are 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.830
 so this challenge has been successful and in 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.390
 lower it was positive because I 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.910
 loved this novel what is a sudden 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:27.310
 good thing and I'm going to dig with you 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.820
 the next book that I will feel from my 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.160
 pillay 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.450
 so here in the garden as you 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.010
 know if you ever made a big cobblestone 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.780
 or a book like that 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.190
 absolutely not read ben ali where I the 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.990
 I will not read because it's true I draw 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.370
 nothing to the papers in front of you that's true 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.750
 than with courts and all these crimes 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.830
 as the groups had I can do 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.240
 books during the holidays 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.550
 and and great holidays are 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.160
 unfortunately still slow good then 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.960
 what are we going to heat up are we going to 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.440
 start as early as teaching but think that 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.440
 that's enough 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:07.080
 never expect to give birth then I have him 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:09.509
 says he smells the wood and it will be 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.120
 the ocean child of jean claude mourlevat 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:13.620
 here is the novel that was drawn so 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.789
 it's really a little book that I 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.779
 by the way I'm pretty fast 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:16.919
 luck with this challenge 

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:18.960
 because every time I felt 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:21.539
 rather small novel easy to read and from 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.460
 blow it does not take a big one big 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:25.710
 space of time in my program of 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.330
 reading so much better and so here's the 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.520
 cover this is a moment that I have 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.870
 bought at a flea market near what 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.999
 I had read the ballade of jean claude 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.710
 mourlevat when I was smaller and that 

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:37.110
 had me too much job is really and 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.669
 clementine beyond the block the worlds of 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.259
 clem also read a novel by jean claude 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:42.180
 mourlevat being small and was also 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:43.889
 too acidic and it reassures me I have not been 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.210
 saddle and suddenly when I saw this 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:46.529
 novel but I still loved 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.479
 the story so when I saw them at the 

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:50.069
 flea market it was at the rally at 50 cents 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:51.389
 I buy it because frankly I have 

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:52.110
 want to discover his pen otherwise I 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:54.270
 know that jean claude 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.669
 mourlevat also wrote earthly and he in 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.050
 also shouting with winter in but I 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:59.490
 know more than anything and they are 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.409
 youth novels that were published at 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.520
 gallimard it seems to me following I am 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:04.110
 almost sure because he's all the 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.349
 time on the gallimard stand at the 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.360
 book 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:08.099
 so logically it's really there 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.439
 down and suddenly I know it is known 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:12.449
 among young people our age among 

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:13.800
 young adults too but for me it's 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:15.659
 true that I'm fixed with books 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.610
 youth for now but why 

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:19.620
 not if I like to discover his pen 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.569
