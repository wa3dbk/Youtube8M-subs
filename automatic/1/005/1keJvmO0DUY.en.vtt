00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
that's where the skin color will be most

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:24.610 
that's where the skin color will be most
visible<00:04:21.680> next<00:04:22.520> we're<00:04:22.700> gonna<00:04:22.850> color<00:04:23.500> kind<00:04:24.500> of

the<00:04:36.650> color<00:04:36.860> a<00:04:37.190> lot<00:04:37.310> better<00:04:37.660> if<00:04:38.660> the<00:04:38.900> glue<00:04:39.110> is

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
the color a lot better if the glue is

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.620 
the color a lot better if the glue is
still<00:04:39.410> a<00:04:39.560> tiny<00:04:40.250> bit<00:04:40.370> sticky<00:04:41.000> which<00:04:41.180> mine

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
still a tiny bit sticky which mine

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.920
