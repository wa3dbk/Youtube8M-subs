I'll make it way easier to cast our five
colors<00:04:50.470> and<00:04:50.770> get<00:04:50.949> slivers<00:04:51.280> into<00:04:51.490> play<00:04:51.639> safer

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
colors and get slivers into play safer

and one forest the meat of all is a
sliver<00:04:56.800> itself<00:04:57.250> so<00:04:57.490> there's<00:04:57.639> no<00:04:57.789> reason<00:04:58.090> not

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:00.099 
to run in the forest is there simply

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:01.800 
to run in the forest is there simply
because<00:05:00.460> we<00:05:00.669> just<00:05:00.819> need<00:05:00.970> more<00:05:01.030> green<00:05:01.539> mana
