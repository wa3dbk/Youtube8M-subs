00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
thing we're going to do is scroll down

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.000 
thing we're going to do is scroll down
here<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.910> AT&amp;T<00:00:15.389> modem<00:00:15.990> card<00:00:16.139> page<00:00:16.500> I'm

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
here to the AT&amp;T modem card page I'm

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.490 
here to the AT&amp;T modem card page I'm
going<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.250> click<00:00:17.430> on<00:00:17.550> that<00:00:17.789> of<00:00:17.940> course<00:00:18.119> and

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
going to click on that of course and

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.260 
going to click on that of course and
then<00:00:19.500> we're<00:00:19.619> gonna<00:00:19.740> scroll<00:00:20.070> down<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.760> the

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
then we're gonna scroll down to the

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.759 
then we're gonna scroll down to the
device<00:00:21.810> we're<00:00:21.990> looking<00:00:22.230> for<00:00:22.410> which<00:00:22.590> is<00:00:22.619> the

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
device we're looking for which is the

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.990 
device we're looking for which is the
sierra<00:00:23.189> wireless<00:00:23.660> mercury<00:00:24.660> USB<00:00:25.470> modem<00:00:25.800> as<00:00:26.789> you

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
sierra wireless mercury USB modem as you

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.370 
sierra wireless mercury USB modem as you
can<00:00:27.150> see<00:00:27.359> this<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.930> first<00:00:28.260> 18<00:00:28.980> t<00:00:29.570> USB<00:00:30.570> card

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
can see this is the first 18 t USB card

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.280 
can see this is the first 18 t USB card
that<00:00:31.800> supports<00:00:32.309> broadband<00:00:33.030> speeds<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.510> 7.2

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
that supports broadband speeds of 7.2

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.979 
that supports broadband speeds of 7.2
megabits<00:00:34.739> per<00:00:34.800> second<00:00:35.280> which<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.120> very<00:00:36.450> fast

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
megabits per second which is very fast

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.729 
megabits per second which is very fast
obviously<00:00:38.390> however<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.750> AT&amp;T<00:00:40.230> network<00:00:40.410> is

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
obviously however the AT&amp;T network is

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.160 
obviously however the AT&amp;T network is
not<00:00:41.040> at<00:00:41.370> this<00:00:41.610> time<00:00:41.670> capable<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.629> those<00:00:42.780> speeds

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
not at this time capable of those speeds

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.940 
not at this time capable of those speeds
but<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.100> nice<00:00:44.219> thing<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:44.460> this<00:00:44.760> card<00:00:45.059> is

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
but the nice thing is this card is

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.290 
but the nice thing is this card is
future-ready<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.520> when<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.760> network<00:00:48.090> has

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
future-ready and when the network has

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.450 
future-ready and when the network has
been<00:00:48.590> upgraded<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:49.710> card<00:00:50.010> will<00:00:50.160> already<00:00:50.370> be

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
been upgraded this card will already be

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.510 
been upgraded this card will already be
ready<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.879> go<00:00:51.620> the<00:00:52.620> current<00:00:53.010> speeds<00:00:53.280> by<00:00:53.460> the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
ready to go the current speeds by the

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.569 
ready to go the current speeds by the
way<00:00:53.730> are<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.750> top<00:00:54.960> speed<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.260> 3.6<00:00:56.070> megabits

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
way are the top speed of 3.6 megabits

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.130 
way are the top speed of 3.6 megabits
per<00:00:56.670> second<00:00:57.180> but<00:00:57.329> your<00:00:57.449> real<00:00:57.660> speeds<00:00:57.960> are

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
per second but your real speeds are

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.799 
per second but your real speeds are
gonna<00:00:58.289> be<00:00:58.440> more<00:00:58.680> like<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:59.180> megabyte<00:01:00.180> per<00:01:00.359> second

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
gonna be more like a megabyte per second

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.579 
gonna be more like a megabyte per second
so<00:01:01.770> anyway<00:01:02.070> we'll<00:01:02.820> hit<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.030> shop<00:01:03.210> now'<00:01:03.359> button
