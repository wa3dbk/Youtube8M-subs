00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
of a hole in the top and we've got to

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.269 
of a hole in the top and we've got to
get<00:00:19.859> this<00:00:20.039> back<00:00:20.310> into<00:00:21.119> shape<00:00:21.779> so<00:00:22.769> here<00:00:23.010> we<00:00:23.100> go

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
get this back into shape so here we go

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.390 
get this back into shape so here we go
what<00:00:24.090> we'll<00:00:24.240> do<00:00:24.359> here<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.600> we'll<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:26.039> by<00:00:26.340> the

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
what we'll do here is we'll and by the

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.390 
what we'll do here is we'll and by the
way<00:00:27.349> these<00:00:28.349> means<00:00:28.619> you're<00:00:28.800> taking<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.189> good

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
way these means you're taking a good

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.120 
way these means you're taking a good
sharp<00:00:29.670> blade<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.179> cut<00:00:30.510> as<00:00:30.720> required<00:00:31.289> all<00:00:31.920> you

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
sharp blade and cut as required all you

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.470 
sharp blade and cut as required all you
need<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.430> just<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.759> little<00:00:32.940> bit<00:00:33.059> off<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.149> top

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
need is just a little bit off the top

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.850 
need is just a little bit off the top
over<00:00:33.780> there<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:35.149> just<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.329> bit<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.570> awful<00:00:36.960> now

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
over there and just a bit of awful now

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.770 
over there and just a bit of awful now
the<00:00:38.579> difference<00:00:38.969> here<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.180> what<00:00:39.510> we're<00:00:39.660> going

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
the difference here is what we're going

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.910 
the difference here is what we're going
to<00:00:39.840> do<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.079> we're<00:00:40.260> going<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.410> place<00:00:40.710> the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
to do is we're going to place the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.869 
to do is we're going to place the
activator<00:00:41.520> on<00:00:41.820> first<00:00:42.590> so<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.770> way<00:00:43.980> as<00:00:44.219> the

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
activator on first so that way as the

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.819 
activator on first so that way as the
adhesive<00:00:45.180> applies<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.230> will<00:00:46.379> harden

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
adhesive applies it will harden

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.760 
adhesive applies it will harden
instantly<00:00:47.700> so<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.570> won't<00:00:48.750> pour<00:00:49.079> into<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.500> shoe

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
instantly so it won't pour into the shoe

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.729 
instantly so it won't pour into the shoe
now<00:00:50.340> these<00:00:50.969> are<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.510> differences<00:00:52.199> in

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
now these are the differences in

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.529 
now these are the differences in
techniques<00:00:53.399> where<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.789> can<00:00:53.969> do<00:00:54.180> with<00:00:54.390> this

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
techniques where you can do with this

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.229 
techniques where you can do with this
product<00:00:54.870> okay<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:56.309> we<00:00:56.430> take<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.670> bit<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:56.969> this

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
product okay so so we take a bit of this

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.720 
product okay so so we take a bit of this
spray<00:00:57.629> here<00:00:57.899> calculator<00:00:58.829> edge<00:00:59.100> it's<00:00:59.430> just<00:00:59.640> a

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
spray here calculator edge it's just a

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.310 
spray here calculator edge it's just a
little<00:00:59.850> bit<00:01:00.030> it's<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.660> similar<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.410> butane<00:01:01.859> it

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
little bit it's a similar to butane it

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.750 
little bit it's a similar to butane it
really<00:01:04.320> really<00:01:04.589> evaporates<00:01:05.129> really<00:01:05.400> quickly

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
really really evaporates really quickly

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.300 
really really evaporates really quickly
and<00:01:06.000> once<00:01:06.810> once<00:01:07.080> it's<00:01:07.260> on<00:01:07.439> it's<00:01:07.710> on<00:01:07.860> there<00:01:08.100> for

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
and once once it's on it's on there for

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.070 
and once once it's on it's on there for
good<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.670> don't<00:01:08.790> have<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.150> put<00:01:09.390> anything<00:01:09.600> in

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
good you don't have to put anything in

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.179 
good you don't have to put anything in
anything<00:01:10.970> you<00:01:11.970> have<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.299> apply<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.570> again<00:01:13.189> it

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
anything you have to apply it again it

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.330 
anything you have to apply it again it
will<00:01:14.700> last<00:01:14.909> for<00:01:15.180> months<00:01:15.360> at<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.630> time<00:01:15.710> so<00:01:16.710> here

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
will last for months at a time so here

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.859 
will last for months at a time so here
we<00:01:17.430> go<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:17.790> now<00:01:17.820> we're<00:01:18.360> going<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.509> do<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.720> we're

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
we go so now we're going to do is we're

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.929 
we go so now we're going to do is we're

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
put this on here before and then put the

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.590 
put this on here before and then put the
the<00:01:33.950> activator<00:01:34.950> on<00:01:35.130> after<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:35.670> here<00:01:35.820> we<00:01:35.939> go<00:01:36.060> so

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
the activator on after so here we go so

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.840 
the activator on after so here we go so
just<00:01:37.520> as<00:01:38.689> slowly<00:01:39.689> as<00:01:40.049> possible<00:01:40.670> so<00:01:41.670> make<00:01:41.820> sure

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
just as slowly as possible so make sure

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.270 
just as slowly as possible so make sure
you<00:01:42.060> get<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.299> all<00:01:42.420> in<00:01:42.600> there<00:01:42.920> try<00:01:43.920> not<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.159> touch

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
you get it all in there try not to touch

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.039 
you get it all in there try not to touch
the<00:01:44.520> tip<00:01:44.869> because<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.990> tip<00:01:46.229> will<00:01:46.470> will<00:01:47.040> harden

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
the tip because the tip will will harden

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.710 
the tip because the tip will will harden
because<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.290> activator<00:01:49.740> okay<00:01:50.220> so<00:01:50.720> there

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
because of the activator okay so there

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.310 
because of the activator okay so there
it<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:52.070> what<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.220> can<00:01:53.369> do<00:01:53.579> is<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.360> can<00:01:54.509> quickly

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
it is what you can do is you can quickly

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.469 
it is what you can do is you can quickly
put<00:01:56.159> some<00:01:56.310> activator<00:01:56.700> on<00:01:56.820> top<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.329> the

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
put some activator on top so the

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.240 
put some activator on top so the
hardness<00:01:57.930> right<00:01:58.170> away<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.770> can<00:01:58.890> just<00:01:58.950> keep

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
hardness right away you can just keep

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.730 
hardness right away you can just keep
building<00:01:59.549> this<00:01:59.820> a<00:02:00.030> lot<00:02:00.750> of<00:02:00.780> body<00:02:01.110> shops<00:02:01.439> do

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
building this a lot of body shops do

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.760 
building this a lot of body shops do
