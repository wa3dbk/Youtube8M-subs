00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
was able to edit the video and

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.310 
was able to edit the video and
everything<00:01:11.610> then<00:01:12.510> they're<00:01:12.689> not<00:01:12.840> loaded<00:01:13.170> to

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320

youtube so how is this possible
how<00:01:18.880> can<00:01:19.060> it<00:01:19.150> not<00:01:19.180> be<00:01:19.360> compatible<00:01:19.840> of<00:01:20.110> mpeg-4

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549
