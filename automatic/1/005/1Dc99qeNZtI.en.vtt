a<00:00:49.120> lot<00:00:49.269> of<00:00:49.329> different<00:00:49.690> information<00:00:49.870> about<00:00:50.319> how

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:50.499 
a lot of different information about how

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:52.559 
a lot of different information about how
to<00:00:50.530> change<00:00:50.890> the<00:00:51.159> color<00:00:51.399> of<00:00:51.640> hydrangea<00:00:52.420> so

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:52.569 
to change the color of hydrangea so

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:53.910 
to change the color of hydrangea so
let's<00:00:52.749> go<00:00:52.870> over<00:00:52.899> a<00:00:53.050> little<00:00:53.170> primer<00:00:53.530> on<00:00:53.710> that

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
let's go over a little primer on that

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.479 
let's go over a little primer on that
sure<00:00:54.280> it's<00:00:54.850> a<00:00:54.940> common<00:00:55.269> question<00:00:55.719> blue<00:00:56.499> is<00:00:56.859> what

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
sure it's a common question blue is what

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.099 
sure it's a common question blue is what
we<00:00:57.609> commonly<00:00:57.789> see<00:00:58.120> around<00:00:58.510> here<00:00:58.659> just<00:00:58.989> because

00:00:59.099 --> 00:00:59.109 
we commonly see around here just because

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:01.739 
we commonly see around here just because
of<00:00:59.319> our<00:00:59.409> soil<00:00:59.739> acidity<00:01:00.399> and<00:01:00.670> the<00:01:01.269> aluminum

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:01.749 
of our soil acidity and the aluminum

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:04.619 
of our soil acidity and the aluminum
content<00:01:02.079> in<00:01:02.620> a<00:01:03.100> container<00:01:03.550> like<00:01:03.729> we<00:01:04.150> have<00:01:04.360> here

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
content in a container like we have here

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.060 
content in a container like we have here
we<00:01:04.750> have<00:01:04.839> some<00:01:04.989> blues<00:01:05.199> and<00:01:05.379> pinks<00:01:05.650> we<00:01:05.770> do<00:01:05.890> some

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
we have some blues and pinks we do some

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.730 
we have some blues and pinks we do some
amending<00:01:06.549> but<00:01:07.329> mostly<00:01:07.780> if<00:01:08.200> you<00:01:08.350> want<00:01:08.530> to<00:01:08.590> go<00:01:08.680> to

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
amending but mostly if you want to go to

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.160 
amending but mostly if you want to go to
pink<00:01:09.250> you<00:01:09.670> need<00:01:09.850> to<00:01:10.030> raise<00:01:10.270> the<00:01:10.630> pH<00:01:10.930> of<00:01:10.960> the

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
pink you need to raise the pH of the

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.700 
pink you need to raise the pH of the
soil<00:01:11.439> which<00:01:12.070> would<00:01:12.250> be<00:01:12.399> lime<00:01:13.240> garden<00:01:13.780> line<00:01:13.930> to

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
soil which would be lime garden line to

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.910 
soil which would be lime garden line to
intensify<00:01:15.189> the<00:01:15.369> blues<00:01:15.729> or<00:01:16.060> to<00:01:16.420> make<00:01:16.750> your<00:01:17.229> pink

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
intensify the blues or to make your pink

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.340 
intensify the blues or to make your pink
ones<00:01:18.159> more<00:01:18.490> blue<00:01:18.850> maybe<00:01:19.450> in<00:01:19.570> a<00:01:19.630> container<00:01:20.049> is

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
ones more blue maybe in a container is

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.880 
ones more blue maybe in a container is
aluminum<00:01:21.100> sulfate<00:01:21.700> and<00:01:22.450> you<00:01:22.719> can<00:01:22.899> maybe<00:01:23.530> do

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
aluminum sulfate and you can maybe do

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.590 
aluminum sulfate and you can maybe do
that<00:01:24.130> application<00:01:24.850> now<00:01:25.000> it<00:01:25.210> might<00:01:25.360> be<00:01:25.570> a

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
that application now it might be a

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.139 
that application now it might be a
little<00:01:25.930> late<00:01:26.350> but<00:01:27.250> if<00:01:27.579> you<00:01:27.729> do<00:01:27.880> want<00:01:28.030> to<00:01:28.119> change

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
little late but if you do want to change

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:30.060 
little late but if you do want to change
the<00:01:28.479> color<00:01:28.719> we<00:01:29.200> may<00:01:29.439> have<00:01:29.649> a<00:01:29.680> couple<00:01:29.829> more

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
the color we may have a couple more

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.620 
the color we may have a couple more
weeks<00:01:30.219> because<00:01:30.700> the<00:01:30.880> general<00:01:31.240> rule<00:01:31.420> of<00:01:31.450> thumb

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
weeks because the general rule of thumb

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.139 
weeks because the general rule of thumb
is<00:01:32.049> once<00:01:32.320> they<00:01:32.619> like<00:01:32.859> this<00:01:33.100> one<00:01:33.340> start<00:01:33.640> showing

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
is once they like this one start showing

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:35.520 
is once they like this one start showing
their<00:01:34.299> color<00:01:34.509> it's<00:01:34.780> probably<00:01:35.079> a<00:01:35.170> little<00:01:35.229> too

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
their color it's probably a little too

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.469 
their color it's probably a little too
late<00:01:35.680> or<00:01:35.920> change<00:01:36.219> it<00:01:36.430> but<00:01:36.969> if<00:01:37.090> they're<00:01:37.270> still

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
late or change it but if they're still

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.359 
late or change it but if they're still
tightly<00:01:37.869> butted<00:01:38.469> you<00:01:38.590> might<00:01:38.770> be<00:01:38.920> able<00:01:39.039> to<00:01:39.250> get

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
tightly butted you might be able to get

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.039 
tightly butted you might be able to get
away<00:01:39.460> with<00:01:39.729> it<00:01:39.850> when<00:01:40.240> is<00:01:40.359> the<00:01:40.479> best<00:01:40.630> time<00:01:40.780> then

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
away with it when is the best time then

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:42.870 
away with it when is the best time then
to<00:01:41.079> do<00:01:41.320> those<00:01:41.530> adjustments<00:01:41.979> if<00:01:42.430> you<00:01:42.520> wanted<00:01:42.789> to

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
to do those adjustments if you wanted to

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.969 
to do those adjustments if you wanted to
change<00:01:43.090> the<00:01:43.180> color<00:01:43.450> mid-march<00:01:44.049> okay<00:01:44.649> and<00:01:44.829> then

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
change the color mid-march okay and then

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.340 
change the color mid-march okay and then
again<00:01:45.219> maybe<00:01:45.369> in<00:01:45.579> mid-april<00:01:45.820> yeah<00:01:46.630> now<00:01:47.289> you

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
again maybe in mid-april yeah now you

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.679 
again maybe in mid-april yeah now you
