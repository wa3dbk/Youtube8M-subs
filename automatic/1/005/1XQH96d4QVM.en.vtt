00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:07.499
 calculate the limit when x store 2 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:10.589
 of x 3 match of x 2 be we see that 

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:13.589
 we have to calculate the limit of one 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:15.400
 function that is a quotient of polynomials 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:19.029
 in 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.720
 x equals that is when x 100 of 2 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.519
 then how 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.310
 the quotients of polynomials are 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.849
 continuous functions first of all that 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.329
 is done is to replace the x by 2 the 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.559
 we replace the x by 2 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:39.079
 + 3 match 2 - 2 and if the thing works 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.809
 well that is if we get a result that 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.479
 it makes sense because that will be the value of 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:47.239
 limit in case this happens to us 

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:48.780
 we will have to think a little more about our 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.930
 case 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:56.190
 we have in numerator 2 plus 35 in the 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.280
 denominator 2 minus 20 and observe that 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.780
 we have obtained a fraction with 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.670
 denominator 0 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.580
 we know a fraction with denominator 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.310
 0 does not make sense 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.799
 that does not give a number 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.509
 but we are in the situation where 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.250
 we are calculating a limit then 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:17.200
 you have to interpret this 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.350
 when we are calculating a limit in 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:25.220
 first place that extends two means 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:27.110
 that x is very close to two without being 2 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.860
 when the limit is calculated when x 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.650
 tends to something x is very close to that 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.080
 something but without being it in our case x is 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.330
 very close to 2 but it is not and as 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.790
 we have seen the procedure replace 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.900
 because the function of which we are 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.780
 calculating the limit is continuous 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.300
 but of course we have obtained a denominator 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.250
 zero 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:56.290
 denominator 0 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:02:01.350
 when x is very close 2 without being 2 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.350
 when we put in place of x the 2 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:07.690
 with this 2 we were referring to something very 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:12.370
 next to 2 without being 2 then something very 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:15.910
 next to 2 without being two minus 2 gives me 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.530
 something very close to zero without being zero or 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.360
 be that what it indicates when we are 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.080
 calculating this limit this zero in the 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.600
 denominator is something very small very very 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:30.270
 small but not being zero little that 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:33.580
 interpretation has 5 / / 05 / between 0 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.800
 means a number divided by something 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.480
 very very small and a divided number 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.020
 between something very small practically 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.430
 zero is very large then this is 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.550
 infinite and this would be the result of 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.190
 limit but an observation before 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.540
 finish that zero be very close to zero 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.349
 can be 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.060
 with negative numbers very close to 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:59.549
 zeros or with positive numbers very 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.590
 close to zero and clear the fact that 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:04.500
 be very close to zero with number 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:10.230
 negative with positive number makes 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:13.109
 this is five more each other is very 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:17.579
 next to zero more negative between - - - 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:19.530
 infinite or five divided if he is very 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:21.870
 close to zero but positive more 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.650
 the more more to more infinite that is 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.900
 this infinity depends on how you're doing 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.620
 approaching here in this denominator to 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.680
 zero 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.470
 then to determine this limit 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.389
 say more infinity minus infinity the 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.129
 truth is that that will depend on if you 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:40.650
 you approach two on the left by the 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:44.099
 right anyway we're going to 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.689
 stop we're not going to perform this 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.879
 study in this problem in others of 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:52.280
 our videos, yes you will find 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:54.470
 the calculation of lateral limits and in 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.900
 and analyze when you approach by the 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:00.910
 left or on the right the result 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.910
 if it is more infinite or less infinite
