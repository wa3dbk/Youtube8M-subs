00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
similar to that now if we take these

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.930 
similar to that now if we take these
chords

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940

and weary fret them this time now we

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:06.990 
and weary fret them this time now we
need<00:01:05.860> to<00:01:05.890> use<00:01:06.190> this<00:01:06.490> is<00:01:06.670> actually

need to use this is actually

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.570 
need to use this is actually
considerably<00:01:07.479> harder<00:01:07.750> to<00:01:08.110> use<00:01:08.470> finger<00:01:09.400> wise

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
considerably harder to use finger wise

but if we take this and we take take it

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.460 
but if we take this and we take take it
out<00:01:13.150> of<00:01:13.180> the<00:01:13.270> open<00:01:13.570> position<00:01:13.690> somewhere<00:01:14.320> a

versatile and we move it it shows up at

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:21.480 
versatile and we move it it shows up at
the<00:01:19.149> fifth<00:01:19.479> fret<00:01:19.810> so<00:01:20.680> to<00:01:20.799> do<00:01:21.009> your<00:01:21.220> you're<00:01:21.430> a

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
should be getting this these two notes

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.080 
should be getting this these two notes
now<00:01:34.470> that's<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.740> basic<00:01:35.190> idea<00:01:35.340> now<00:01:35.790> in<00:01:36.000> the

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
now that's the basic idea now in the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.290 
now that's the basic idea now in the
beginning<00:01:36.510> demo<00:01:37.500> here<00:01:37.800> I<00:01:38.010> was<00:01:38.670> doing<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.150> with

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
beginning demo here I was doing it with

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.750 
beginning demo here I was doing it with
kind<00:01:39.870> of<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.110> whole<00:01:40.530> shuffle<00:01:40.920> with<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.100> down<00:01:41.400> up

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
kind of a whole shuffle with a down up

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.210 
kind of a whole shuffle with a down up
down<00:01:41.790> up<00:01:42.030> down<00:01:42.390> up<00:01:42.770> you<00:01:43.770> probably<00:01:43.890> want<00:01:44.190> to

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
down up down up you probably want to

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.620 
down up down up you probably want to
start<00:01:44.460> with<00:01:44.520> just<00:01:44.790> downs<00:01:45.120> until<00:01:45.510> you're

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
start with just downs until you're

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.630 
start with just downs until you're
comfortable<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.290> then<00:01:46.890> try<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.160> work<00:01:47.400> in<00:01:47.550> the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
comfortable and then try to work in the

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.860 
comfortable and then try to work in the
ups<00:01:47.790> because<00:01:47.970> it's<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.300> little<00:01:48.479> bit<00:01:48.600> harder<00:01:48.840> to

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:48.870 
ups because it's a little bit harder to

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.250 
ups because it's a little bit harder to
control<00:01:50.240> but<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.600> know<00:01:51.690> I'll<00:01:51.900> do<00:01:52.050> it<00:01:52.140> both

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
control but you know I'll do it both

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.190 
control but you know I'll do it both
ways<00:01:52.440> so<00:01:53.010> anyway<00:01:53.340> this<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.479> your<00:01:54.600> shuffle<00:01:54.780> cord

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
ways so anyway this is your shuffle cord

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.020 
ways so anyway this is your shuffle cord
and<00:01:55.410> you're<00:01:55.830> going<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.040> apply<00:01:56.190> the<00:01:56.280> same<00:01:56.640> idea

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
and you're going to apply the same idea

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.430 
and you're going to apply the same idea
as<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.270> open<00:01:57.720> shuffle<00:01:58.110> where<00:01:58.200> you're<00:01:58.320> going

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
as the open shuffle where you're going

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.890 
as the open shuffle where you're going
to<00:01:58.530> strum<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.770> twice<00:01:59.100> and<00:02:00.090> then<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.630> have<00:02:00.780> an

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
to strum it twice and then you have an

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.840 
to strum it twice and then you have an
extension<00:02:01.470> now<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.770> extension<00:02:02.369> has<00:02:02.550> to<00:02:02.729> be

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
extension now the extension has to be

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.330 
extension now the extension has to be
with<00:02:03.060> your<00:02:03.210> pinky<00:02:03.740> and<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.830> need<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.100> stretch

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
with your pinky and you need to stretch

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.710 
with your pinky and you need to stretch
two<00:02:05.640> frets<00:02:05.940> above<00:02:06.300> your<00:02:06.990> third<00:02:07.290> finger<00:02:08.660> so<00:02:09.660> you

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.720 
two frets above your third finger so you
should<00:02:09.989> be<00:02:10.140> getting<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.679> ninth<00:02:11.070> fret<00:02:11.370> on<00:02:11.670> the

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.729 

so<00:02:40.239> that's<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.659> move<00:02:40.870> now<00:02:41.080> this<00:02:41.260> move<00:02:41.470> gets

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
so that's the move now this move gets

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.030 
so that's the move now this move gets
transplanted<00:02:42.569> on<00:02:43.569> different<00:02:44.260> string<00:02:44.560> sets<00:02:44.860> in

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
transplanted on different string sets in

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.860 
transplanted on different string sets in
different<00:02:45.340> places<00:02:45.519> on<00:02:45.849> the<00:02:45.970> neck<00:02:46.180> and<00:02:46.390> just

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
different places on the neck and just

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.140 
different places on the neck and just
goes<00:02:47.049> through<00:02:47.080> the<00:02:47.409> 12-bar<00:02:47.799> form<00:02:48.400> so<00:02:48.849> that's

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
goes through the 12-bar form so that's

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.050 
goes through the 12-bar form so that's
pretty<00:02:49.420> much<00:02:49.599> it's<00:02:49.989> actually<00:02:50.260> very<00:02:50.290> simple<00:02:50.500> to

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
pretty much it's actually very simple to

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.130 
pretty much it's actually very simple to
understand<00:02:52.060> it<00:02:52.239> it's<00:02:52.390> just<00:02:52.540> harder<00:02:52.870> to<00:02:52.900> play

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
understand it it's just harder to play

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.449 
understand it it's just harder to play
it<00:02:53.319> so<00:02:54.120> our<00:02:55.120> first<00:02:55.420> move<00:02:55.750> goes<00:02:56.560> to<00:02:56.830> a<00:02:56.860> D<00:02:57.129> chord

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
it so our first move goes to a D chord

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.350 
it so our first move goes to a D chord
not<00:02:58.120> from<00:02:58.330> here<00:02:58.739> addy<00:02:59.739> is<00:02:59.769> simply<00:03:00.430> moving<00:03:00.700> up<00:03:01.060> a

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
not from here addy is simply moving up a

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.369 
not from here addy is simply moving up a
string<00:03:01.629> set<00:03:03.540> same<00:03:04.540> thing<00:03:04.900> a<00:03:05.049> little<00:03:05.260> bit

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
string set same thing a little bit

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:06.809 
string set same thing a little bit
trickier<00:03:05.799> though<00:03:05.980> because<00:03:06.159> now<00:03:06.430> your<00:03:06.610> first

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
trickier though because now your first

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.569 
trickier though because now your first
finger<00:03:07.319> needs<00:03:08.319> to<00:03:08.500> create<00:03:08.739> a<00:03:08.829> mute<00:03:09.129> by

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
finger needs to create a mute by

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.080 
finger needs to create a mute by
blocking<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.420> low<00:03:10.569> string<00:03:10.810> out<00:03:11.340> so<00:03:12.340> you

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
blocking the low string out so you

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.690 
blocking the low string out so you
should<00:03:13.360> be<00:03:13.569> fretting<00:03:14.079> your<00:03:14.950> a<00:03:14.980> string<00:03:15.400> at<00:03:15.670> the

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
should be fretting your a string at the

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.619 
should be fretting your a string at the
fifth<00:03:16.000> fret<00:03:16.680> and<00:03:17.680> creating<00:03:18.609> a<00:03:18.700> mute<00:03:18.910> on<00:03:19.150> the<00:03:19.239> E

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:19.629 
fifth fret and creating a mute on the E

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:22.020 
fifth fret and creating a mute on the E
string<00:03:20.019> and<00:03:20.230> you<00:03:20.859> create<00:03:21.099> a<00:03:21.160> mute<00:03:21.400> by<00:03:21.579> actually

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
string and you create a mute by actually

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.300 
string and you create a mute by actually
writing<00:03:22.720> the<00:03:22.870> underside<00:03:23.470> of<00:03:23.500> the<00:03:23.680> string<00:03:23.950> very

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
writing the underside of the string very

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.250 
writing the underside of the string very
carefully<00:03:24.970> to<00:03:25.000> where<00:03:25.269> you're<00:03:25.420> not<00:03:25.599> over

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
carefully to where you're not over

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.660 
carefully to where you're not over
barring<00:03:26.680> and<00:03:26.829> you're<00:03:26.920> flopping<00:03:27.129> over<00:03:27.400> this

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
barring and you're flopping over this

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.720 
barring and you're flopping over this
way<00:03:28.500> I'm<00:03:29.500> getting<00:03:29.650> three<00:03:30.099> notes<00:03:30.310> as<00:03:30.489> you<00:03:30.519> hit

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
way I'm getting three notes as you hit

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.550 
way I'm getting three notes as you hit
your<00:03:30.879> power<00:03:31.090> cord<00:03:31.329> you<00:03:32.109> don't<00:03:32.230> want<00:03:32.349> to<00:03:32.440> do

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
your power cord you don't want to do

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.770 
your power cord you don't want to do
that<00:03:32.819> so<00:03:33.819> you're<00:03:33.940> joining<00:03:34.120> some<00:03:34.390> garden<00:03:34.720> at

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
that so you're joining some garden at

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.089 
that so you're joining some garden at
least<00:03:35.220> and<00:03:36.220> you<00:03:36.400> want<00:03:36.579> to<00:03:36.819> I<00:03:37.680> don't<00:03:38.680> I<00:03:38.769> think<00:03:39.010> of

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
least and you want to I don't I think of

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:40.650 
least and you want to I don't I think of
it<00:03:39.190> as<00:03:39.340> a<00:03:39.370> trolley<00:03:39.700> cable<00:03:39.970> kind<00:03:40.389> of<00:03:40.480> thing

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
it as a trolley cable kind of thing

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.599 
it as a trolley cable kind of thing
where<00:03:40.840> your<00:03:41.019> fingers<00:03:41.380> you<00:03:42.099> know<00:03:42.130> the<00:03:42.370> trolley

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
where your fingers you know the trolley

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:44.339 
where your fingers you know the trolley
and<00:03:42.819> this<00:03:42.970> is<00:03:43.120> the<00:03:43.269> cable<00:03:43.450> more<00:03:43.959> or<00:03:44.049> less<00:03:44.109> is

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
and this is the cable more or less is

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:45.720 
and this is the cable more or less is
that<00:03:44.500> you're<00:03:44.650> actually<00:03:44.829> just<00:03:45.220> physically

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
that you're actually just physically

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.789 
that you're actually just physically
right<00:03:46.419> underneath<00:03:46.810> the<00:03:47.169> string<00:03:47.470> so<00:03:47.650> you're

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
right underneath the string so you're

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.960 
right underneath the string so you're
creating<00:03:48.099> a<00:03:48.130> meet<00:03:48.310> with<00:03:48.340> your<00:03:48.609> first<00:03:48.730> finger

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.430 

because<00:03:51.540> you're<00:03:51.690> strumming<00:03:51.930> through<00:03:52.200> three

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
because you're strumming through three

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.840 
because you're strumming through three
strings<00:03:52.740> you<00:03:52.890> just<00:03:53.070> want<00:03:53.220> to<00:03:53.250> hear<00:03:53.400> two<00:03:53.610> and

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
strings you just want to hear two and

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.240 
strings you just want to hear two and
you<00:03:54.270> plug<00:03:54.480> in<00:03:54.630> the<00:03:54.720> same<00:03:54.960> shuffle<00:03:55.530> pattern

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
you plug in the same shuffle pattern

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:04.540 
you plug in the same shuffle pattern
there<00:03:57.890> oops<00:03:59.390> any<00:04:00.390> better<00:04:00.630> than<00:04:00.750> that

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:16.690 

okay<00:04:05.550> and<00:04:05.760> now<00:04:05.879> the<00:04:05.940> form<00:04:06.360> sounds<00:04:06.870> like<00:04:07.050> this

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:30.300 

you

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:39.100 

give<00:04:31.310> to<00:04:31.520> our<00:04:31.669> e<00:04:32.860> passing<00:04:33.860> forward<00:04:38.110> turn

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
give to our e passing forward turn

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.790 
give to our e passing forward turn
around

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
around

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.659 
around
so<00:04:41.759> from<00:04:42.360> the<00:04:42.479> e<00:04:42.509> part<00:04:42.990> we<00:04:43.199> have<00:04:43.379> this<00:04:43.669> same

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
so from the e part we have this same

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.550 
so from the e part we have this same
exact<00:04:45.060> cord<00:04:45.360> as<00:04:45.569> the<00:04:45.720> D

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
exact cord as the D

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.040 
exact cord as the D
we<00:04:48.100> just<00:04:48.370> shift<00:04:48.580> up<00:04:48.850> to<00:04:49.060> the<00:04:49.210> 7th<00:04:49.540> fret<00:04:49.690> first

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
we just shift up to the 7th fret first

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.500 
we just shift up to the 7th fret first
time<00:04:50.260> we've<00:04:50.440> moved<00:04:50.650> out<00:04:50.800> of<00:04:50.919> position<00:04:51.090> so<00:04:52.090> no

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
time we've moved out of position so no

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.430 
time we've moved out of position so no
low<00:04:52.720> string<00:04:53.080> seventh<00:04:53.680> fret<00:04:53.740> a<00:04:54.010> string<00:04:55.440> ninth

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
low string seventh fret a string ninth

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.620 
low string seventh fret a string ninth
fret<00:04:56.770> on<00:04:56.919> the<00:04:57.010> D<00:04:57.190> string<00:04:57.340> so<00:04:57.850> power<00:04:58.030> cord<00:04:58.389> built

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
fret on the D string so power cord built

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:04.230 
fret on the D string so power cord built
off<00:04:58.810> of<00:04:58.860> that<00:04:59.860> note<00:05:02.580> that's<00:05:03.580> all<00:05:03.820> we<00:05:03.940> get<00:05:04.090> on

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
off of that note that's all we get on

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.590 
off of that note that's all we get on
the<00:05:04.330> eat<00:05:04.510> just<00:05:04.840> that<00:05:05.020> much

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.560 

and<00:05:08.960> then<00:05:09.380> we<00:05:09.680> on<00:05:10.160> that<00:05:10.310> final<00:05:10.670> move<00:05:11.000> actually

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
and then we on that final move actually

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.740 
and then we on that final move actually
for<00:05:11.840> a<00:05:11.870> little<00:05:12.050> bit<00:05:12.200> of<00:05:12.320> spice<00:05:12.560> I<00:05:12.890> added<00:05:13.340> that<00:05:13.750> a

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
for a little bit of spice I added that a

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.600 
for a little bit of spice I added that a

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
look at it power cord down a deep so

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:28.260 
look at it power cord down a deep so
that<00:05:21.020> e<00:05:21.200> part<00:05:21.650> sounds<00:05:22.010> like

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:33.150 

one<00:05:28.870> more<00:05:29.020> time

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160
