00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.390 
IM x 53 based processor platform runs

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.120 
IM x 53 based processor platform runs
linux<00:00:22.810> and<00:00:22.960> then<00:00:23.050> on<00:00:23.170> top<00:00:23.410> of<00:00:23.470> that<00:00:23.620> we

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130 
linux and then on top of that we

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.400 
linux and then on top of that we
actually<00:00:24.340> have<00:00:24.730> an<00:00:25.660> android<00:00:26.140> based

actually have an android based

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.040 
actually have an android based
environment<00:00:26.800> with<00:00:27.220> our<00:00:27.460> IDG<00:00:28.270> connector<00:00:28.750> on<00:00:28.900> it

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050 
environment with our IDG connector on it

lot of i/o and a lot of user interfaces
for<00:00:37.420> real-world<00:00:37.870> applications<00:00:38.860> and<00:00:39.460> I<00:00:39.730> gather

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
for real-world applications and I gather

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.040 
for real-world applications and I gather

phones so what we've done here is we've

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:21.179 
phones so what we've done here is we've
actually<00:01:18.219> built<00:01:18.670> this<00:01:19.119> demonstration<00:01:20.049> of<00:01:20.350> you

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
actually built this demonstration of you

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:22.859 
actually built this demonstration of you
have<00:01:21.280> to<00:01:21.429> put<00:01:21.579> yourself<00:01:21.700> and<00:01:22.149> pretend<00:01:22.569> that<00:01:22.780> we

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
have to put yourself and pretend that we

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.349 
have to put yourself and pretend that we
actually<00:01:23.079> have<00:01:23.530> a<00:01:23.770> bus<00:01:24.159> we<00:01:24.520> don't<00:01:24.609> couldn't

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:25.359 
actually have a bus we don't couldn't

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:27.289 
actually have a bus we don't couldn't
quite<00:01:25.450> fit<00:01:25.780> a<00:01:25.810> bus<00:01:26.109> here<00:01:26.380> in<00:01:26.499> the<00:01:26.590> hallway<00:01:26.799> so

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
quite fit a bus here in the hallway so

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.019 
quite fit a bus here in the hallway so
we'll<00:01:28.299> make<00:01:28.479> do<00:01:28.979> let<00:01:29.979> so<00:01:30.130> as<00:01:30.249> you<00:01:30.399> can<00:01:30.549> see<00:01:30.789> what

00:01:31.019 --> 00:01:31.029 
we'll make do let so as you can see what

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:33.899 
we'll make do let so as you can see what
we<00:01:31.149> have<00:01:31.359> is<00:01:31.630> we<00:01:31.779> have<00:01:31.810> a<00:01:32.310> driver<00:01:33.310> control

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
we have is we have a driver control

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:35.879 
we have is we have a driver control
screen<00:01:34.329> if<00:01:34.539> you<00:01:34.659> look<00:01:34.810> at<00:01:34.929> the<00:01:35.049> driver<00:01:35.380> control

00:01:35.879 --> 00:01:35.889 
screen if you look at the driver control

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:38.849 
screen if you look at the driver control
screen<00:01:36.219> you'll<00:01:36.700> find<00:01:37.029> that<00:01:37.329> it<00:01:37.810> it<00:01:38.529> has<00:01:38.829> a

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:38.859 
screen you'll find that it it has a

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:40.949 
screen you'll find that it it has a
place<00:01:39.579> where<00:01:39.729> you<00:01:39.819> can<00:01:39.939> detect<00:01:40.299> how<00:01:40.539> much<00:01:40.719> has

00:01:40.949 --> 00:01:40.959 
place where you can detect how much has

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:42.629 
place where you can detect how much has
been<00:01:40.990> paid<00:01:41.439> how<00:01:41.649> much<00:01:41.709> has<00:01:41.950> been<00:01:41.979> collected

00:01:42.629 --> 00:01:42.639 
been paid how much has been collected

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:45.389 
been paid how much has been collected
what<00:01:43.329> the<00:01:43.450> fair<00:01:43.689> base<00:01:43.899> is<00:01:44.200> you'll<00:01:44.950> see<00:01:45.189> this

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
what the fair base is you'll see this

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:46.999 
what the fair base is you'll see this
second<00:01:45.939> window<00:01:46.329> here<00:01:46.599> where<00:01:46.779> we<00:01:46.899> have

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
second window here where we have

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.669 
second window here where we have
actually<00:01:48.009> a<00:01:48.039> view<00:01:48.670> to<00:01:48.849> the<00:01:48.909> camera<00:01:49.420> of<00:01:49.679> showing

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
actually a view to the camera of showing

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:51.870 
actually a view to the camera of showing
what's<00:01:50.889> going<00:01:51.159> on<00:01:51.340> and<00:01:51.520> so<00:01:51.609> you<00:01:51.700> can<00:01:51.819> see

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
what's going on and so you can see

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.760 
what's going on and so you can see
particularly<00:01:52.359> if<00:01:52.569> there<00:01:52.689> are<00:01:52.749> any<00:01:52.840> kids<00:01:53.529> out

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
particularly if there are any kids out

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.469 
particularly if there are any kids out
there<00:01:53.979> that<00:01:54.039> might<00:01:54.369> be<00:01:54.549> misbehaving<00:01:54.819> you<00:01:55.359> know

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
there that might be misbehaving you know

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.559 
there that might be misbehaving you know
that<00:01:55.630> sometimes<00:01:55.869> happens<00:01:56.259> on<00:01:56.649> buses<00:01:57.359> third<00:01:58.359> we

00:01:58.559 --> 00:01:58.569 
that sometimes happens on buses third we

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:01.109 
that sometimes happens on buses third we
have<00:01:58.749> the<00:01:59.020> map<00:01:59.499> view<00:01:59.950> so<00:02:00.579> the<00:02:00.729> driver<00:02:00.999> can

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
have the map view so the driver can

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.359 
have the map view so the driver can
actually<00:02:01.689> see<00:02:01.929> not<00:02:02.169> only<00:02:02.200> where<00:02:02.619> his<00:02:02.859> buses

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
actually see not only where his buses

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.789 
actually see not only where his buses
but<00:02:04.119> he<00:02:04.179> can<00:02:04.329> also<00:02:04.419> see<00:02:04.869> where<00:02:05.049> other<00:02:05.259> buses

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
but he can also see where other buses

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:07.469 
but he can also see where other buses
are<00:02:05.950> on<00:02:06.069> the<00:02:06.219> route<00:02:06.399> so<00:02:06.609> he<00:02:06.729> can<00:02:06.880> maintain

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
are on the route so he can maintain

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.469 
are on the route so he can maintain
proper<00:02:08.289> spacing<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.940> then<00:02:10.269> of<00:02:10.450> course

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
proper spacing and then of course

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.050 
proper spacing and then of course
finally<00:02:10.959> maybe<00:02:11.950> there's<00:02:12.189> some<00:02:12.370> music<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:12.970> the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
finally maybe there's some music and the

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.260 
finally maybe there's some music and the
driver<00:02:13.360> can<00:02:13.569> also<00:02:13.750> play<00:02:14.110> some<00:02:14.140> music

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
driver can also play some music

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.630 
driver can also play some music
and<00:02:15.780> actually<00:02:16.410> control<00:02:17.040> some<00:02:17.370> of<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.520> other

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
and actually control some of the other

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.340 
and actually control some of the other
things<00:02:17.730> from<00:02:18.120> this<00:02:18.240> touch<00:02:18.510> screen<00:02:18.540> here<00:02:19.140> like

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
things from this touch screen here like

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.440 
things from this touch screen here like
being<00:02:19.740> able<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:20.010> open<00:02:20.490> and<00:02:20.640> close<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:21.180> doors

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
being able to open and close the doors

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.140 
being able to open and close the doors

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
that map that you saw where the the bus

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.880 
that map that you saw where the the bus
was<00:02:32.250> well<00:02:32.910> a<00:02:33.210> passenger<00:02:34.200> that's<00:02:34.470> sitting<00:02:34.770> at<00:02:34.860> a
