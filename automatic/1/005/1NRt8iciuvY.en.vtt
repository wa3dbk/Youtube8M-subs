00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.980
 the first day of the week I promise 

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:08.469
 96 if you want to know how to make some 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.870
 easy and quick nails for this day of 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:13.500
 dead I invite you to keep seeing 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.500
 this video 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.929
 for the first design what we're going to 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.689
 use is base for our nail 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:31.759
 enamel orange black green shine and 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.949
 a finite brush the first thing we will do 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.199
 will be to place the base for our lady and 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:38.329
 the orange glaze then with the 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:40.339
 brush I'm going to make two little triangles 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.040
 each side of our nail figuring their 

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:44.659
 ears and let's join with a line 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.930
 just like I'm showing you in this 

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:46.930
 video 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.940
 then we are going to fill the area with the 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.190
 brush that comes in our enamel 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:26.140
 then with a punch or toothpick and 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.140
 green enamel I will make your eyes 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.970
 later with a little glaze 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.240
 orange I'm going to fill in the 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:38.140
 small triangles leaving a slight edge like this 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.140
 as I am showing it to you 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.570
 let's clean the brush and with enamel 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.230
 black we will make a vertical line to 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.230
 every ojito 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.460
 and that's how our first 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.100
 idea for the second idea we are going to 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.920
 use nail base white enamel 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.840
 red blue sky black shine a brush 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.850
 finite and a punch the first thing that 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.920
 we will apply the base for nails and 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.780
 our white enamel and with the brush and 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.490
 red enamel I will make hairline by 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.490
 The entire surface of our nail 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.319
 and now with the punch and blue enamel 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.390
 sky I'm going to put a point in the middle and 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.870
 with the brush I will make the 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.870
 circle 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.379
 and then we are going to put another black dot 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.330
 in the middle of the blue enamel and then another 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.830
 smallest white point to the edge of 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.230
 this and that's how our second one is 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.450
 idea for the third idea we're going to 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.550
 Use base for nail polish black 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.860
 golden shine a finite brush and a 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.260
 punch what we will do is place the 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.569
 base for nails and black enamel and with a 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.459
 punch and a little gold glaze I'll 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.799
 place a point in the middle and with the 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:18.150
 brush and a little more glaze I'll 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.150
 make like a disc 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.069
 then on top of the asterisk I'm going to do 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.380
 three circles one smaller one 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:38.390
 medium and a larger one covering all 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.390
 our nail to simulate the cobweb 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.910
 and that's how our third 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.950
 idea for the fourth idea what are we going to 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.560
 need is base for our nail 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.020
 enamels black white red shine a 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.030
 finite brush and a punch what we will do 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.280
 it will be to place our base and red enamel 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.340
 then with a punch we will do 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.080
 dots in the shape of an oval and with 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.500
 our enamel brush we're going to 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.500
 Fill 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.250
 then with the finite brush and a little 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.350
 of white enamel I will make some 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.690
 little triangles in each half circle that 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:32.400
 excels in taking care that all the peaks 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.400
 of the triangles look inwards 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:08.180
 let's clean our brush and now 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:10.730
 let's put some spots with enamel 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.180
 red again in the fangs simulating 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.180
 blood 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:17.419
 and that is how our fourth 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:19.789
 idea for the fifth idea we will need 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.650
 base for our nail two shades of 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:24.289
 orange enamel one stronger than the 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.479
 another green glaze black glitter and a 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:28.430
 finite brush what we will do will be 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:31.009
 place the base for our nail and 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.229
 our dark orange enamel and now 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:35.139
 with light orange enamel and brush 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:38.139
 finite I'm going to make vertical lines 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:38.139
 followed 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:47.110
 then with the brush already clean we are going to 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.600
 place the green enamel on the part 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.870
 top of our nail simulating the 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.870
 leaflets 

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:58.699
 we clean the brush and now with enamel 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.809
 black we will make two triangles in the middle 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:01.809
 simulating your eyes 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:13.650
 and in the lower part we are going to make your 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:16.220
 mouth leaving two little holes and you 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.220
 I am teaching it 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.970
 and that's how these five ideas are 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:32.699
 super easy for this day of the dead 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:34.620
 I hope you liked it a lot and so 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:36.720
 see you tomorrow with the second video of 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:41.000
 the week of terror I love you enough 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.000
 and I send a big kiss ay
