00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.790
 many of us have seen graffiti in 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.650
 streets and so on its simplest ways 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.500
 they are more complex not the place where 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.540
 we can not find avenues streets houses 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.550
 the fast and it has become a way of 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.199
 expression for the poorest or more 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.150
 repressed and is that although during 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.070
 many times he has made a bad name 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.380
 in many countries it has served as 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.449
 social protest and in many others it occupies 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.939
 its place as a form of manifestation of 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.590
 the one or not john but the graffiti not only 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.630
 it takes place in the streets sure 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.120
 heard that places like london paris 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.649
 the angels berlin barcelona are places 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.020
 key in the development of urban art 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.090
 However, something is happening in Mexico 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.370
 big and it's happening here in the museum 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.140
 diego rivera-anahuacalli in particular is 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.170
 an exhibition that brings together the eight 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.760
 best or one of the maximums and 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.289
 Mexican muralists today 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.120
 eight artists with styles and 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.640
 totally different personalities 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.530
 as tik as also he began the painting 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.390
 the streets whenever he has some 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.760
 cans and a fence on the street where 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.500
 paint this pint 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.710
 undoubtedly one of the most experienced 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.479
 of the group I personally admired very much 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.890
 your work always has a meaning 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.780
 incredible social 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.490
 paola del fin or main theme is the 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.950
 female figure not until now because the 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.479
 take a phrase from frida kahlo of feet 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.520
 so I want them if I have wings for 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.210
 fly is why they come here to a girl 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.960
 dancing looking is a girl who paints 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.780
 comments the incredible even this in his 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.750
 works are sold in enough galleries 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.630
 be recognized diego zelaya in reality 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.289
 all my work is about trying 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.390
 to present a good relationship between 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:45.060
 wild world and the world of the city 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.190
 Wine wines is an incredible human being 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.310
 it is much more focused on what is 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.920
 a little beige realism and this one is 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.470
 focuses on the realism itea you can see 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.240
 pints he has done with pure spray and 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.970
 that looks like a photograph totally 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.069
 incredible dÃ¡vila spoke a little bit like 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.709
 to take up the knowledge that we have 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:05.670
 lost as spiritual but I do not like 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:07.619
 much 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.750
 how to explain why I like to listen 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.209
 the interpretation of the people when the 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.630
 I see and danielle bux vague I am still 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.950
 a boy of 10 years that I have 23 yo 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.630
 when I sit down and do this it's the same 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.180
 that I have been doing since elementary school 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.610
 from kindergarten then how do I continue 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.069
 playing in the cartoon and obviously it's 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.650
 channel 5 all the cartoons that 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.349
 all this happened like I leave something in 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.579
 changed my hand to see things 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.560
 We do not show you the 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:37.930
 exhibition we show you the artists 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:43.090
 preparing the exhibition and you would leave 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:48.080
 collaborate but with the color we are going to 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:50.030
 put a little see here on the banks 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.770
 artists that show you that those 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.200
 scratches you see on the street many times 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.510
 they are art come enjoy and know new 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:01.090
 Mexican artists consume culture the 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.090
 culture is power this is the king pm
