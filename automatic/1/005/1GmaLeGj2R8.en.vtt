know<00:01:34.630> people<00:01:34.900> do<00:01:35.020> mount<00:01:35.230> climb<00:01:35.440> mountains<00:01:35.830> and

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
know people do mount climb mountains and

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.210 
know people do mount climb mountains and
this<00:01:36.310> is<00:01:36.460> very<00:01:36.910> slow<00:01:37.120> they<00:01:37.380> have<00:01:38.380> purpose<00:01:39.070> and

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
this is very slow they have purpose and

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.920 
this is very slow they have purpose and
reason<00:01:39.280> which<00:01:39.520> is<00:01:39.550> to<00:01:39.790> conquer<00:01:40.090> it<00:01:40.390> I<00:01:40.570> think

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
reason which is to conquer it I think

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.730 
reason which is to conquer it I think
because<00:01:41.230> live<00:01:41.440> shows<00:01:41.710> so<00:01:41.740> much<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:44.290> it<00:01:44.410> puts

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
because live shows so much and it puts

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.320 
because live shows so much and it puts
in<00:01:44.830> perspective<00:01:44.980> on<00:01:45.460> things<00:01:45.610> and<00:01:45.880> I've<00:01:46.150> met

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330
