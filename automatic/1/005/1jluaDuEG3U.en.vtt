case camera to get to the ball but watch
the<00:01:52.840> rotation<00:01:53.409> I<00:01:53.759> don't<00:01:54.759> think<00:01:54.969> she<00:01:55.060> has<00:01:55.180> good

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
the rotation I don't think she has good

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.399 
the rotation I don't think she has good
shoulder<00:01:55.659> rotation<00:01:55.929> when<00:01:56.020> she<00:01:56.109> was<00:01:56.229> in<00:01:56.289> one

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
shoulder rotation when she was in one

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.219 
shoulder rotation when she was in one
hand<00:01:56.619> and<00:01:56.770> she<00:01:56.859> does<00:01:57.009> two<00:01:57.189> hands<00:01:58.109> yeah<00:01:59.109> that's

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
hand and she does two hands yeah that's

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.160 
hand and she does two hands yeah that's
why<00:01:59.320> her<00:01:59.409> 200<00:01:59.829> so<00:01:59.950> much<00:02:00.039> better<00:02:01.170> great

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
why her 200 so much better great

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.429 
why her 200 so much better great
beautiful<00:02:02.859> 200<00:02:03.549> foreign<00:02:03.789> to<00:02:03.850> him<00:02:03.969> backhand<00:02:04.439> it

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
beautiful 200 foreign to him backhand it

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:07.230 
beautiful 200 foreign to him backhand it
puts<00:02:05.619> a<00:02:05.710> start<00:02:06.070> not<00:02:06.490> good<00:02:06.670> place<00:02:06.789> to<00:02:06.909> finish<00:02:07.179> I

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
puts a start not good place to finish I

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.150 
puts a start not good place to finish I
think<00:02:07.359> it<00:02:07.570> limits<00:02:07.899> your<00:02:08.019> mobility<00:02:08.259> and<00:02:08.769> your

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
think it limits your mobility and your

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.970 
think it limits your mobility and your
ability<00:02:09.459> to<00:02:09.519> get<00:02:09.640> there<00:02:09.880> as<00:02:10.000> time<00:02:10.239> goes<00:02:10.390> by

ability to get there as time goes by

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:15.510 
ability to get there as time goes by
