00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.040
 Greetings to all and welcome to a 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.800
 new video tutorial here on video 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.890
 dot image is in the video tutorial of the 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.050
 today we deal with the issue that each 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.279
 once we bought a camera in this 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:33.350
 cano case with reflex after the 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:38.059
 camera also usually comes a cedÃ© a 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:42.379
 compass dix with a software called zeus 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:44.600
 utility where we can use it but that 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.120
 we almost always forget to install it 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.790
 in the video tutorial of the day then we go 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:54.090
 to explain how it is installed once 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:57.150
 we have put in our reader 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.160
 cd because only not only we have to 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:04.510
 execute the setup that we give 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:06.490
 and now we get this message because we 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.619
 this box comes out 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.850
 and then we give it as we are in 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:13.439
 Europe we explain here 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.439
 Near East Europe and Africa 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:20.970
 you start reading and here it appears 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:28.170
 here it appears to us because it selects the country 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:31.170
 or region as it is selected in Spain ' 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.170
 following 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.960
 select the Spanish language 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.220
 we hope that 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.700
 go do your work there is the cde 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.700
 is reading 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.110
 digital camera software and installation 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.710
 simple 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:56.210
 this is version 25 installation 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.210
 automatic all software 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.450
 custom installation 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:08.020
 cano image gualeguay 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.020
 we go to the custom installation 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.750
 to accept 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.439
 and here he asks us what we want 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.730
 install we see that we can install 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:25.590
 digital professional photos of the utility 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:28.220
 Image browser picture this I gave you tore 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.440
 and photo steve 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.540
 does not tell you an application that allows 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.880
 merge a series of images 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:38.230
 proposals to form a single vision 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.230
 seamless panoramic 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.959
 this is the pitu of this software editor 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.310
 for creating style files 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.410
 image 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.020
 the member will be software for the 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.850
 print display of it 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:56.630
 of the images load the computer 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:59.270
 The utility software for camera 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.860
 to download images on the computer 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.170
 specify the configuration of the 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.590
 camera and take pictures remotely 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.530
 in the digital photo professional 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.970
 software to view or edit raw images 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.819
 recommended for photographers who take 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.130
 mostly raw images 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:20.580
 because with this this is what comes in the 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:24.410
 compass dix and the only thing we're going to do 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.410
 is to install the next girl 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.760
 and now we are in point 2 and 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.230
 we confirm that this is what we want 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.230
 install and we give you to install 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.170
 now it appears from point 3 the 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:44.000
 license 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:47.480
 if you want to read it and we give it to each other 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.580
 when installing the camera software it 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.260
 automatically downloaded from the internet 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.260
 latest complementary software 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.040
 we give him yes 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.190
 I told him I was not wrong he's sure 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:10.860
 what do you want to have I do not want 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.860
 stop we give you yes and here that yes 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.239
 we allow him 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:24.100
 and now 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:26.550
 the program will begin in step 4 to 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.420
 install 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:32.950
 right now 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:37.050
 is calculating how much approximate time 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.050
 It will take time to analyze all this 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.900
 and it is happening 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.680
 what we have to do is wait for 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.529
 what 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:55.740
 finish installing everything 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:58.919
 so little by little this will go away 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:02.270
 here it says it will take about two minutes 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:02.270
 in settling 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:10.289
 already installed the digital professional photo 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:14.539
 already installed the utility now going to 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:14.539
 install the browser image 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.520
 now it's the turn of vÃ­ctor is this 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:24.520
 the editor 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.759
 and now finally the 'photo' stage 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.580
 now we see that it puts what result of the 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:40.990
 All installed process we give to the 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:44.290
 next step 5 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:46.980
 since registering now in this case you 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:50.650
 I will say no later 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:51.520
 next to register in canon image 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.740
 and gualeguay 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.220
 later you will need to insert the cd 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:06:00.009
 and make tribute records 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:02.529
 let's accept and finalize 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:08.369
 once we have done that we have already 

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:14.999
 installed on our pc as the software 

00:06:08.369 --> 00:06:14.999
 from our photo camera 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:23.700
 and as we see on the desk we are 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:26.720
 the icons are then installed 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:29.830
 of the programs 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.830
 that we have seen previously
