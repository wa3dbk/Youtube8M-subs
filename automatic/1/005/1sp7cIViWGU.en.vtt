00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:16.350

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.810
 way to prepare it yes that leads to that 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:24.680

 red garlic wine white toast bread and a 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:34.020
 dish but I think it's not going to 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.489
 start we would start like that is what 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.730
 first you're going to eat to apply the 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.730
 pepper 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.470
 if someone has not tried the urta 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:50.989
 it is very soft very soft can be done 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.989
 also with other fish 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.670
 we do a little bit of egypt 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.219
 the chopped fruit very very very chopped 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.780
 immediate that this stew this way of 

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:14.850
 cooking the bottles can be done with 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.119
 other fish for example with hake 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.869
 with gold you can do with what 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:26.030
 I want it to be white, so let's go 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.030
 to add pepper to pepper 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.870
 now you have to anchor a little and 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:38.400
 then we're going to take the sauce 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:41.220
 Spanish you have a sauce there 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:46.290
 and what is this is a Spanish sauce 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:48.300
 and the bottomless of meat with vegetables and 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.090
 has to be reducing a lot and then 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.440
