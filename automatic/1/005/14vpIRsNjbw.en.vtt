because I do enjoy the concert when I'm

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.819 
because I do enjoy the concert when I'm
filming<00:03:33.010> but<00:03:33.430> it<00:03:33.760> is<00:03:34.349> easier<00:03:35.349> to<00:03:35.410> enjoy<00:03:35.709> it

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829

when<00:03:35.920> you're<00:03:36.040> not<00:03:36.190> filming<00:03:36.340> because<00:03:36.489> you<00:03:36.609> can

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
when you're not filming because you can

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.390 
when you're not filming because you can
jump<00:03:36.940> around<00:03:37.030> and<00:03:37.359> have<00:03:37.569> so<00:03:37.780> much<00:03:37.840> fun<00:03:38.170> but<00:03:38.950> I
