fuel savings available by using x1 tires
we<00:00:17.810> we<00:00:18.439> decided<00:00:18.890> we<00:00:19.009> would<00:00:19.160> give<00:00:19.279> that<00:00:19.460> a<00:00:19.490> try

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:19.699 
we we decided we would give that a try

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:22.079 
we we decided we would give that a try
with<00:00:20.089> fuel<00:00:20.300> prices<00:00:20.329> going<00:00:20.960> up<00:00:21.289> all<00:00:21.619> the<00:00:21.829> time

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:22.089 
with fuel prices going up all the time

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:24.700 
with fuel prices going up all the time
we<00:00:23.089> changed<00:00:23.480> over<00:00:23.570> the<00:00:23.749> order<00:00:24.019> on<00:00:24.230> a<00:00:24.259> hundred

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
we changed over the order on a hundred

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.950 
we changed over the order on a hundred
tractors<00:00:25.249> and<00:00:25.550> have<00:00:26.119> them<00:00:26.300> come<00:00:26.509> in<00:00:26.630> with<00:00:26.749> ex

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
tractors and have them come in with ex

tractors and have them come in with ex
ones<00:00:27.289> we<00:00:28.130> expected<00:00:28.730> to<00:00:28.820> get<00:00:28.939> a<00:00:28.999> two<00:00:29.269> and<00:00:29.390> a<00:00:29.449> half

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
ones we expected to get a two and a half

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.599 
ones we expected to get a two and a half
to<00:00:29.749> three<00:00:29.779> percent<00:00:30.169> increase<00:00:30.829> in<00:00:31.400> fuel

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:31.609 
to three percent increase in fuel

to three percent increase in fuel
mileage<00:00:33.190> after<00:00:34.190> we<00:00:34.309> had<00:00:34.399> ran<00:00:34.579> about<00:00:34.789> two

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
mileage after we had ran about two

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.400 
mileage after we had ran about two
hundred<00:00:35.059> fifty<00:00:35.329> thousand<00:00:35.809> miles<00:00:35.960> on<00:00:36.199> those

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
hundred fifty thousand miles on those

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.049 
hundred fifty thousand miles on those
tractors<00:00:36.920> we<00:00:37.219> found<00:00:37.489> that<00:00:37.670> we<00:00:37.789> were<00:00:37.879> actually

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
tractors we found that we were actually

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.540 
tractors we found that we were actually
four<00:00:38.600> percent<00:00:39.019> better<00:00:39.230> which<00:00:39.920> is<00:00:40.070> exceeded

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
four percent better which is exceeded

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.849 
four percent better which is exceeded
the<00:00:40.670> expectations<00:00:40.910> that<00:00:41.359> we<00:00:41.480> had<00:00:41.809> so<00:00:42.649> that

00:00:42.849 --> 00:00:42.859 
the expectations that we had so that

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:44.770 
the expectations that we had so that
confirmed<00:00:43.340> that<00:00:43.460> we<00:00:43.969> were<00:00:44.120> doing<00:00:44.539> the<00:00:44.629> right

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
confirmed that we were doing the right

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.069 
confirmed that we were doing the right
thing<00:00:45.050> by<00:00:45.199> putting<00:00:45.350> x1<00:00:45.829> zones<00:00:46.539> we<00:00:47.539> found<00:00:47.809> later

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
thing by putting x1 zones we found later

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:50.950 
thing by putting x1 zones we found later
that<00:00:48.379> the<00:00:48.559> tire<00:00:49.039> life<00:00:49.370> was<00:00:49.879> better<00:00:50.629> than

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
that the tire life was better than

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.319 
that the tire life was better than
projected<00:00:51.399> so<00:00:52.399> we<00:00:52.550> found<00:00:52.789> that<00:00:52.879> our<00:00:53.059> fuel

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
projected so we found that our fuel

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.259 
projected so we found that our fuel
savings<00:00:53.809> and<00:00:54.039> overall<00:00:55.039> cost<00:00:55.399> were<00:00:55.969> much

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:56.269 
savings and overall cost were much

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:57.639 
savings and overall cost were much
better<00:00:56.480> with<00:00:56.780> the<00:00:56.899> ex<00:00:57.019> ones<00:00:57.289> and<00:00:57.530> they<00:00:57.589> were

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
better with the ex ones and they were

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.340 
better with the ex ones and they were
with<00:00:57.949> the<00:00:58.100> dual<00:00:58.329> at<00:00:59.329> that<00:00:59.539> point<00:00:59.809> we<00:00:59.960> changed

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
with the dual at that point we changed

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.079 
with the dual at that point we changed
the<00:01:00.469> order<00:01:00.499> for<00:01:01.010> all<00:01:01.129> of<00:01:01.160> our<00:01:01.370> new<00:01:01.579> trailers<00:01:01.969> to

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
the order for all of our new trailers to

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:05.079 
the order for all of our new trailers to
come<00:01:02.239> in<00:01:02.390> on<00:01:02.510> x1<00:01:02.960> and<00:01:03.829> every<00:01:04.580> vehicle<00:01:04.939> that

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
come in on x1 and every vehicle that

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.429 
come in on x1 and every vehicle that
come<00:01:05.390> in<00:01:05.540> since<00:01:05.840> then<00:01:06.049> has<00:01:06.409> been<00:01:06.710> on<00:01:06.860> x1

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:11.690 

we<00:01:10.439> found<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.009> was<00:01:11.130> much<00:01:11.310> easier<00:01:11.369> to

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
we found that it was much easier to

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.639 
we found that it was much easier to
rotate<00:01:11.970> X<00:01:12.420> ones<00:01:12.720> as<00:01:12.930> opposed<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.290> duels

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:13.649 
rotate X ones as opposed to duels

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:16.069 
rotate X ones as opposed to duels
because<00:01:14.070> you're<00:01:14.729> only<00:01:14.820> rotating<00:01:15.630> four<00:01:15.840> tires

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:16.079 
because you're only rotating four tires

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:18.319 
because you're only rotating four tires
as<00:01:16.380> opposed<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.829> hey<00:01:17.009> when<00:01:17.970> we<00:01:18.090> were<00:01:18.210> running

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:18.329 
as opposed to hey when we were running

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:18.770 
as opposed to hey when we were running
duel

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
duel

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.990 
duel
we<00:01:19.020> didn't<00:01:19.380> rotate<00:01:19.710> tires<00:01:20.159> like<00:01:20.490> we<00:01:20.670> should

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
we didn't rotate tires like we should

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.690 
we didn't rotate tires like we should
and<00:01:21.360> since<00:01:22.289> the<00:01:22.470> labor<00:01:22.710> was<00:01:23.039> half<00:01:23.280> as<00:01:23.490> much

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
and since the labor was half as much

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.210 
and since the labor was half as much
with<00:01:23.939> an<00:01:24.090> x<00:01:24.330> one<00:01:24.600> we<00:01:25.170> are<00:01:25.350> actually<00:01:25.590> doing

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
with an x one we are actually doing

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.100 
with an x one we are actually doing
maintenance<00:01:26.939> now<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.570> we<00:01:27.659> should<00:01:27.689> have<00:01:27.960> been

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
maintenance now that we should have been

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.830 
maintenance now that we should have been
doing<00:01:28.140> all<00:01:28.439> along<00:01:32.360> the<00:01:33.360> things<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.750> we

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
doing all along the things that we

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.990 
doing all along the things that we
didn't<00:01:34.200> expect<00:01:34.500> at<00:01:34.740> all<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:35.310> our<00:01:35.759> maintenance

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
didn't expect at all is our maintenance

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.179 
didn't expect at all is our maintenance
costs<00:01:36.479> have<00:01:36.570> actually<00:01:36.720> gone<00:01:37.170> down<00:01:37.200> because

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
costs have actually gone down because

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.309 
costs have actually gone down because
when<00:01:39.000> drivers<00:01:39.450> would<00:01:39.600> have<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.780> flat<00:01:40.079> would

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:40.319 
when drivers would have a flat would

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:42.139 
when drivers would have a flat would
duels<00:01:40.560> they<00:01:41.310> would<00:01:41.459> think<00:01:41.640> they<00:01:41.759> still<00:01:42.000> had

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
duels they would think they still had

duels they would think they still had
one<00:01:42.390> tire<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.869> they<00:01:42.959> could<00:01:43.110> go<00:01:43.319> with<00:01:43.560> and

one tire that they could go with and

one tire that they could go with and
that<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.789> cap<00:01:45.060> would<00:01:45.270> come<00:01:45.479> off<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.020> tear<00:01:46.200> our

that the cap would come off and tear our
cross<00:01:46.619> members<00:01:47.069> and<00:01:47.310> mud<00:01:47.520> flaps<00:01:47.789> and<00:01:48.090> lights

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.919 
cross members and mud flaps and lights
now<00:01:49.289> when<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.590> driver<00:01:49.920> has<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.220> flat<00:01:51.149> with<00:01:51.390> an<00:01:51.509> x1

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:51.929 
now when a driver has a flat with an x1

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:54.740 
now when a driver has a flat with an x1
he<00:01:52.649> knows<00:01:52.799> he<00:01:52.950> has<00:01:53.099> to<00:01:53.130> stop<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:54.030> get<00:01:54.539> that

he knows he has to stop and get that
repaired<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.740> saves<00:01:56.039> us<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.220> lot<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.459> money<00:01:56.700> him

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
repaired it saves us a lot of money him

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.359 
repaired it saves us a lot of money him
and<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:58.200> repairs<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:58.830> don't<00:01:59.009> have<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.250> be

and the repairs that don't have to be

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.710 
and the repairs that don't have to be
made<00:01:59.520> later<00:01:59.819> because<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.390> everything<00:02:00.599> that

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
made later because of everything that

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.289 
made later because of everything that
was<00:02:00.899> torn<00:02:01.140> up<00:02:04.220> being<00:02:05.220> refrigerated<00:02:05.610> carrier
