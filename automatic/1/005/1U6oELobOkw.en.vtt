00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:11.219
 hi friends comrade asked for 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.380
 installation assistance 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.109
 filter 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:20.010
 decided to run for yourself to put 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:21.060
 separator apparently Korean-made 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.640
 but I think 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:31.730
 Chinese means complexity in what means 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.730
 place as you can see between the battery 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:40.969
 spare wheel and here's the main filter 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.620
 virtually no had to put 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.920
 mount under the separator need not regular 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:01.860
 place that is not on the frame 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:06.040
 what we did is showing the pipe 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.020
 square 40 by twenty two 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.200
 stuff 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:15.880
 welded plate with a turn after 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:20.770
 hot on the heat turned it on 90 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:25.770
 degrees made technological visible 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.770
 to the mounting hole 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:45.329
 sun interferes here it all and it all 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:49.069
 case fixed bolts time to buy 50 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.069
 rubles means 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:58.340
 what was wearing the outlet from the tank was going before 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:01.979
 here on the regular filter 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.640
 Well, further to the engine now that we 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:08.989
 made through an adapter 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:15.239
 because the diameter 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:20.010
 video diameter yes did not fit entrances 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:21.230
 the entrance to the separator did not fit properly 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.959
 tubes 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:32.220
 through adapter through additional 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:38.670
 pipe connected from the tank connected from 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:41.160
 tank separator output separator already to 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:47.180
 the standard filter turned out to be two 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:51.980
 filter in a row well separator action 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:56.420
 you understand youtube google and many more 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:03:00.709
 look see there will be questions 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:04.519
 set put likes 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.519
 but see what
