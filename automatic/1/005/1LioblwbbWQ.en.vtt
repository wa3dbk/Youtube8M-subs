but a problem I was having with my
actual<00:06:38.810> exterior<00:06:39.139> play<00:06:39.319> is<00:06:39.949> that<00:06:40.159> like<00:06:40.610> a

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639 
actual exterior play is that like a

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:42.279 
actual exterior play is that like a
slight<00:06:41.000> a<00:06:41.029> slight<00:06:41.180> movement<00:06:41.750> even<00:06:41.810> if<00:06:41.960> I<00:06:41.990> close

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:42.289

slight a slight movement even if I close
the<00:06:42.469> screen<00:06:42.680> because<00:06:43.340> it's<00:06:43.580> really<00:06:43.669> old<00:06:43.940> it

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:44.810 
the screen because it's really old it

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.629 
the screen because it's really old it
