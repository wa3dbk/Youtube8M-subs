00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 the preservation of bird species 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.850
 is a major concern among 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.919
 scientists and environmental groups 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.019
 product of the oil spill in the 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.700
 gulf of mexico the life cycle of 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.700
 these animals is affected 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.500
 unfortunately the oil spill 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.390
 has arrived on the coasts since last 20 of 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.930
 April pollutes the waters of the Gulf of 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.360
 Mexico 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.100
 around 110 species of birds 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.500
 migrants transit through the area 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.090
 affected according to the national federation of 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.630
 Wildlife the forecast is 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.630
 reserved 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.250
 these birds feed on the same 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.519
 areas where oil is found like this 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.559
 that over time we will see blockages 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:45.809
 poor and what will happen certainly a 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:50.309
 bird colony in size so close to the 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:53.010
 oil is worrying in this era 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.409
 of the year 25 million birds move 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.260
 in the area while that happens and before 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:01:00.839
 the pressures the state of california to 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.579
 West of the US canceled a project 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:04.940
 oil exploitation in front of its 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.940
 coasts 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.750
 the fishermen without work the spill 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:16.270
 massive oil destroying everything 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.189
 our very privileged ecosystem this 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.409
 it's not going to happen here in california because 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:23.130
 that reason I withdraw my support for the project 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:25.560
 quiet at the ready 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.420
 According to the authorities, the black spot 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.579
 will extend in the coming days to 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.759
 coasts of Florida 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.860
 moment more than 400 animal species are 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.070
 the direct victims of the drama 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.070
 ecological 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:42.210
 in the midst of frantic meetings and after 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.860
 pressures from the US government in 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.750
 British Petroleum is committed to 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.909
 pay the costs generated by the spill 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.680
 of oil in the Gulf of Mexico 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.600
 however the transnational has a 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.340
 history of accidents caused by 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.649
 the lack of controls within their 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.330
 structure for example the explosion of 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.500
 the refinery of the city of texas in 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.780
 2005 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.659
 this event resulted in 15 deaths and more than 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.580
 800 injured that same year the platform 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.740
 of the British oil company in the countryside 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.509
 ton del horse collapsed when it was 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.330
 hit by the hurricane of 11 in the 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.310
 gulf of mexico then in 2006 a 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.070
 Gas pipeline leaking crude in the slope 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.140
 north of alaska brought criticism to bp and 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.830
 led to one of the worst disasters in 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.830
 the story is fine
