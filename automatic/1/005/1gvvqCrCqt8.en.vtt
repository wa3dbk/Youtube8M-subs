00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:35.899 
old geezer called sorry and i'm glad
they<00:02:34.650> added<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:35.069> white<00:02:35.220> gloves<00:02:35.489> this<00:02:35.700> year

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
they added the white gloves this year

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:37.910 
they added the white gloves this year
because<00:02:36.090> there's<00:02:36.930> me<00:02:37.230> in<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.439> past<00:02:37.650> is

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
because there's me in the past is

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.710 
because there's me in the past is
forgotten<00:02:38.069> to<00:02:38.549> add<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.819> gloves<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.420> I<00:02:39.510> think

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
forgotten to add the gloves and I think

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.619 
forgotten to add the gloves and I think
the<00:02:39.840> gloves<00:02:40.079> had<00:02:40.590> a<00:02:40.620> lot<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:41.069> address<00:02:41.480> and<00:02:42.480> it

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
the gloves had a lot to address and it

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.929 
the gloves had a lot to address and it
just<00:02:42.810> makes<00:02:42.989> it<00:02:43.109> less<00:02:43.260> much<00:02:43.560> more<00:02:43.739> detailed<00:02:44.129> so

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:44.939 
just makes it less much more detailed so

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:47.869 
just makes it less much more detailed so
I'm<00:02:45.720> very<00:02:45.870> glad<00:02:46.200> with<00:02:46.439> that<00:02:46.620> and<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.579> bottom

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.250 
designs I'm very pretty I love her but
the<00:02:56.760> one<00:02:56.909> thing<00:02:57.120> I<00:02:57.299> must<00:02:57.329> complain<00:02:57.810> about<00:02:57.959> her

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
the one thing I must complain about her

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.839 
the one thing I must complain about her
is<00:02:58.560> that<00:02:58.590> she<00:02:59.329> has<00:03:00.329> the<00:03:00.540> blue<00:03:00.750> flat<00:03:01.079> and<00:03:01.609> as<00:03:02.609> you

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
is that she has the blue flat and as you

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.050 
is that she has the blue flat and as you
know<00:03:03.000> Cinderella<00:03:03.329> has<00:03:03.810> glass<00:03:04.230> slippers<00:03:05.060> so

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
know Cinderella has glass slippers so

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.220 
know Cinderella has glass slippers so
that's<00:03:06.480> really<00:03:06.690> annoying<00:03:07.049> and<00:03:07.879> I<00:03:09.230> understated

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
that's really annoying and I understated

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.039 
that's really annoying and I understated
at<00:03:10.319> least<00:03:10.560> make<00:03:10.769> the<00:03:10.950> slippers<00:03:12.049> transparent

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
at least make the slippers transparent

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:17.470 
at least make the slippers transparent
or<00:03:13.650> something<00:03:14.069> but<00:03:15.030> my<00:03:15.209> order<00:03:15.480> lightly<00:03:16.079> flats

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
or something but my order lightly flats

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.559 
or something but my order lightly flats
but<00:03:18.480> whatever<00:03:19.439> i<00:03:19.799> guess<00:03:20.370> we<00:03:20.670> could<00:03:20.879> switch

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
but whatever i guess we could switch

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.710 
but whatever i guess we could switch
them<00:03:21.780> with<00:03:21.930> other<00:03:22.170> Cinderella<00:03:23.040> dolls<00:03:23.310> and<00:03:23.760> she

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
she still has to bend and snap because

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.039 
she still has to bend and snap because
the<00:03:31.440> dolls<00:03:31.680> last<00:03:31.949> year<00:03:32.160> most<00:03:32.430> of<00:03:32.549> them<00:03:32.699> had

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
the dolls last year most of them had

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.259 
the dolls last year most of them had
defective<00:03:34.049> legs<00:03:34.290> because<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.579> honor<00:03:35.760> I<00:03:36.030> got

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
defective legs because the honor I got

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.839 
defective legs because the honor I got
that<00:03:36.599> has<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:37.019> body<00:03:37.440> from<00:03:37.709> last<00:03:37.859> year<00:03:38.099> she

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
that has the body from last year she

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:41.420 
that has the body from last year she
can't<00:03:39.120> really<00:03:39.209> sit<00:03:39.989> that<00:03:40.199> well<00:03:40.440> so<00:03:41.370> I'm

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
can't really sit that well so I'm

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.300 
can't really sit that well so I'm
guessing<00:03:41.609> that's<00:03:41.879> why<00:03:42.150> so<00:03:42.540> in<00:03:43.440> that<00:03:43.680> case<00:03:43.949> and

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
guessing that's why so in that case and

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.879 
guessing that's why so in that case and
not<00:03:44.879> really<00:03:45.030> that<00:03:45.239> bad<00:03:45.449> about<00:03:45.599> it<00:03:45.870> so<00:03:46.709> yeah

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
not really that bad about it so yeah
