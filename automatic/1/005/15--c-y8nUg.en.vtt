basically the answer is a little bit
tricky<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.179> this<00:00:30.420> because<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.720> really<00:00:30.779> depends

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
tricky to this because it really depends

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.729 
tricky to this because it really depends
on<00:00:31.410> your<00:00:31.470> level<00:00:31.800> if<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.790> are<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.390> beginner<00:00:34.290> i

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
on your level if you are a beginner i

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.370 
on your level if you are a beginner i
would<00:00:35.040> say<00:00:35.340> that<00:00:35.940> some<00:00:36.540> sort<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.840> interaction

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
would say that some sort of interaction

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.200 
would say that some sort of interaction
where<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:37.800> get<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.070> ask<00:00:38.219> questions<00:00:38.460> is

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
where you get to ask questions is

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.530 
where you get to ask questions is
important<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:40.410> don't<00:00:41.370> care<00:00:41.940> whether<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.510> kind

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
important I don't care whether that kind

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.940 
important I don't care whether that kind
of<00:00:42.930> interaction<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.739> online<00:00:44.219> or<00:00:45.079> in<00:00:46.079> person<00:00:46.440> I

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
of interaction is online or in person I

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.310 
of interaction is online or in person I
still<00:00:47.489> think<00:00:47.700> some<00:00:48.030> sort<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.510> interaction<00:00:49.110> is

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320

still think some sort of interaction is
important<00:00:49.739> because<00:00:49.860> when<00:00:50.430> you're<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.610> beginner

hopefully that helps everybody at the
same<00:02:04.649> time<00:02:04.829> so<00:02:05.040> that's<00:02:05.219> kind<00:02:05.369> of<00:02:05.399> an<00:02:05.520> easy

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
same time so that's kind of an easy

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.899 
same time so that's kind of an easy
quick<00:02:05.990> way<00:02:06.170> but<00:02:07.070> if<00:02:07.159> you<00:02:07.220> do<00:02:07.340> have<00:02:07.520> some<00:02:07.729> sort

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
quick way but if you do have some sort

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.760 
quick way but if you do have some sort

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
of interaction with the online websites

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.500 
of interaction with the online websites
that<00:02:09.890> you<00:02:10.009> did<00:02:10.280> classes<00:02:10.819> that<00:02:11.030> you're<00:02:11.120> taking

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
that you did classes that you're taking

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.199 
that you did classes that you're taking
then<00:02:12.080> it<00:02:12.620> will<00:02:12.770> be<00:02:12.860> important<00:02:13.850> to<00:02:13.940> keep<00:02:14.180> your

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
then it will be important to keep your

that you are having a hard time with to
that<00:02:25.100> class<00:02:25.959> but<00:02:26.959> if<00:02:27.260> you're<00:02:27.440> an<00:02:27.590> intermediate

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
that class but if you're an intermediate

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.770 
that class but if you're an intermediate
and<00:02:28.459> it's<00:02:28.640> really<00:02:28.850> a<00:02:28.940> matter<00:02:29.180> of<00:02:29.360> just<00:02:29.600> kind<00:02:29.690> of

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
and it's really a matter of just kind of

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.270 
and it's really a matter of just kind of
mastering<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.470> things<00:02:30.680> you<00:02:30.800> already<00:02:30.950> know

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
mastering the things you already know

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.710 
mastering the things you already know

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
and kind of getting better at him or

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.080 
and kind of getting better at him or
kind<00:02:33.200> of<00:02:33.290> smooth<00:02:33.680> in<00:02:33.890> orbit<00:02:34.370> you're<00:02:34.520> dancing

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
kind of smooth in orbit you're dancing

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.490

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
and get it to the next level maybe of

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.370 
and get it to the next level maybe of
choreography<00:02:37.190> create<00:02:37.880> your<00:02:38.030> moves<00:02:38.600> you

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
choreography create your moves you

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.229 
choreography create your moves you
definitely<00:02:39.769> do<00:02:40.070> not<00:02:40.100> need<00:02:40.310> a<00:02:40.519> teacher<00:02:40.790> to<00:02:41.090> do

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
definitely do not need a teacher to do

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.270 
definitely do not need a teacher to do

go<00:03:25.340> with<00:03:25.459> it<00:03:25.610> if<00:03:25.820> it's<00:03:25.970> a<00:03:26.060> matter<00:03:26.239> of<00:03:26.329> just<00:03:26.390> like

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
go with it if it's a matter of just like

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.440 
go with it if it's a matter of just like
learning<00:03:26.870> your<00:03:27.140> basics<00:03:27.530> and<00:03:27.680> working<00:03:27.980> out

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
then you probably don't care too much

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.250 
then you probably don't care too much
about<00:03:30.860> looking<00:03:31.670> stage<00:03:32.060> ready<00:03:32.540> but<00:03:33.019> if<00:03:33.110> you

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260
