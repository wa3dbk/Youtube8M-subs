00:00:10.727 --> 00:00:12.727
 It all starts in the night 

00:00:12.875 --> 00:00:13.890
 cold 

00:00:13.961 --> 00:00:15.031
 single 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:17.578
 And only one sound accompanies you 

00:00:17.656 --> 00:00:20.710
 The sound has become the symbol for this sneaky action game series. 

00:00:23.383 --> 00:00:26.804
 Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell is a challenging game, 

00:00:26.844 --> 00:00:29.445
 Compare with the Hitman or Metal Gear Solid 

00:00:29.555 --> 00:00:32.406
 Compelling players to follow strict rules 

00:00:32.453 --> 00:00:37.250
 But it was this harshness that brought the big fan community like today. 

00:00:37.623 --> 00:00:40.757
 For years, the series has changed its direction 

00:00:40.805 --> 00:00:44.632
 step out of the night, to come to the bright light, the light of gunfighting 

00:00:44.715 --> 00:00:46.851
 Hollywood explosions 

00:00:46.922 --> 00:00:51.046
 fall into the pitfalls that many blockbuster action games take on the third person 

00:00:51.086 --> 00:00:54.953
 Whether or not this change is welcome depends on each person's point of view 

00:00:55.016 --> 00:00:57.664
 But the important thing is how Splinter Cell will continue 

00:00:57.758 --> 00:01:01.265
 What is the vision of the developer aiming at? 

00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:08.062
 Until the E3 Fair 2012, it seems that the direction of action is still upheld 

00:01:08.117 --> 00:01:10.281
 and it made many people disappointed 

00:01:10.383 --> 00:01:12.976
 Add another brand of Splinter Cell game 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.875
 But the sneaky substance that we love is gone. 

00:01:16.055 --> 00:01:19.250
 But, forget all the prejudices that a short demo brings 

00:01:19.273 --> 00:01:22.437
 At Sologame, we experienced and knew for sure 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.953
 Splinter Cell has returned to the darkness. 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.273
 Blacklist is not a reboot version or change any elements of the series 

00:01:31.352 --> 00:01:34.421
 what it achieved is more impressive than that. 

00:01:34.508 --> 00:01:37.835
 Reinforce the most quintessential, combined with improvements in gameplay 

00:01:37.852 --> 00:01:39.851
 to be more suitable for modern audiences 

00:01:39.914 --> 00:01:43.265
 From there, it makes an extremely attractive and rich Splinter Cell experience 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.787
 Ubisoft Toronto's first studio game was not afraid to return to a large scale 

00:01:51.858 --> 00:01:54.498
 what people feel is missing in Conviction. 

00:01:55.334 --> 00:01:59.996
 Story play, Coop Split-screen or online, battlefield playing online 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.887
 Leaderboard rankings, upgrade and customize weapons 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.418
 equipped with advanced technology for aerial bases, 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.739
 Concept Art, detailed annexes for each character, each location 

00:02:08.807 --> 00:02:12.714
 In short, you can't ask for more than that for $ 60 

00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:16.668
 Blacklist's plot is very familiar to Tom Clancy brand 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.059
 A mysterious terrorist organization is threatening the United States 

00:02:19.114 --> 00:02:22.582
 forced President Patricia Caldwell to establish 4th Echelon 

00:02:22.614 --> 00:02:26.520
 Special unit under the command of the first Splinter Cell agent, Sam Fisher 

00:02:26.622 --> 00:02:29.715
 On the Paladin mobile base, a multifunctional aircraft 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.801
 4th Echelon moves around the world 

00:02:31.895 --> 00:02:37.075
 Collect intelligence, do everything you can to stop the attack before it's too late. 

00:02:37.216 --> 00:02:41.075
 No longer a lone warrior, Sam must now get used to being a commander 

00:02:41.106 --> 00:02:43.434
 Be willing to trust your life in the team. 

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:47.410
 This is a new direction, which may make Sam's role slightly lower 

00:02:47.458 --> 00:02:51.129
 But it is very suitable to build new relationships and interactions between characters 

00:02:51.177 --> 00:02:54.145
 The interaction is shown very vividly with transmission acting 

00:02:54.171 --> 00:02:56.520
 with Full Performance Capture technology 

00:02:56.583 --> 00:03:02.332
 This can be said to be the biggest breakthrough of Splinter Cell in the 7th, Ps3 and Xbox 360 console. 

00:03:08.983 --> 00:03:11.452
 Just one name found out that everything ended 

00:03:11.522 --> 00:03:13.452
 Who did she forget she was talking to? 

00:03:13.905 --> 00:03:17.733
 On the battlefield, Sam has recovered all of the stripped skills in Conviction 

00:03:17.835 --> 00:03:20.288
 and of course also interesting additions. 

00:03:20.522 --> 00:03:23.709
 Each level can be overcome by three different play styles 

00:03:23.757 --> 00:03:26.295
 Ghost, Panther and Assault 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.467
 Ghost is a classic play, hide in the dark 

00:03:29.515 --> 00:03:33.045
 Do not make any noise, take full advantage of the functions of the device 

00:03:33.093 --> 00:03:35.319
 penetrate and disappear without trace 

00:03:35.413 --> 00:03:39.561
 In contrast to that, Assault, breaking the door, using enemy troops as a shield, 

00:03:39.585 --> 00:03:45.866
 Shoot everything that moves and no one is alive to tell that Sam Fisher is here 

00:03:46.163 --> 00:03:49.655
 Panther, an intermediate play style that appears in Conviction, 

00:03:49.684 --> 00:03:52.856
 But it is also improved by flexibility in new mechanisms. 

00:03:58.505 --> 00:04:00.505
 The combination of 3 styles of play 

00:04:00.567 --> 00:04:04.067
 brings the most varied and exciting action game I've ever experienced 

00:04:04.145 --> 00:04:08.270
 A game that you can pass the first time you play in any way 

00:04:08.325 --> 00:04:10.574
 But there is a clear motivation to come back 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:13.348
 reload checkpoint, handle situations perfectly. 

00:04:13.387 --> 00:04:18.504
 The more you explore the level, dodge enemies and collect data files, the more points you will earn 

00:04:18.762 --> 00:04:23.090
 The score will then be transferred to the cash received by the Paladin base from the US government 

00:04:23.158 --> 00:04:26.254
 That of course makes Stealth play more important, 

00:04:26.309 --> 00:04:28.238
 because if successful in Ghost style 

00:04:28.294 --> 00:04:31.629
 Sam will unlock more devices and upgrade the base. 

00:04:31.794 --> 00:04:34.637
 Retooling helps you focus on your gameplay more 

00:04:34.708 --> 00:04:36.613
 increase tactical choices, 

00:04:36.653 --> 00:04:38.333
 Paladin upgrade again affects the whole experience 

00:04:38.387 --> 00:04:41.582
 as an improved Radar, unlocking weapons etc. 

00:04:41.622 --> 00:04:44.723
 This is a simple system but it can be addictive 

00:04:44.778 --> 00:04:48.473
 and make players constantly immerse in the world of Splinter Cell. 

00:05:04.163 --> 00:05:06.301
 I have certain doubts but Blacklist 

00:05:06.372 --> 00:05:10.035
 has blown away all the quality that is said to be the culmination of the Stealth Action series 

00:05:10.395 --> 00:05:13.238
 Bring back all the old and new values, distinctive styles 

00:05:13.278 --> 00:05:16.543
 Objective and clear vision of the development team. 

00:05:16.583 --> 00:05:22.324
 The Sologame will be back with Blacklist in the coop and multiplayer review section Spies vs Merc 

00:05:22.356 --> 00:05:25.379
 For now, see you guys next time.
