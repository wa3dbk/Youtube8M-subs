00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:08.450
 physical 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:11.110
 and coaching is that it is a tool 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.110
 very useful 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.660
 the categories whatever their age 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:21.230
 thus potentiate their capabilities 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:23.240
 improve in the strong and obviously the 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.880
 weak points make them less and less 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.430
 of changes hello how am I the coach 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.060
 Guillermo Cardenas was one of the 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.430
 instructors accreditation in coaching 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.780
 sporting and sports leadership that 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.510
 he gave all the coaches here 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.390
 of pumas basic forces makes a 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.370
 huge pleasure to be with them and observe 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.820
 what 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:48.100
 through the course most of the 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.250
 coaches could complement the 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.720
 tactical technical training including 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.000
 physical preparation with this tool 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.970
 what is the mental and emotional preparation 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.650
 they were all working 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.410
 individual processes with players 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:07.729
 then the impact to this course is 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:10.039
 immediately towards the players and 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:13.319
 It leaves a very good impression 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:17.240
 finished this first stage 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:20.930
 giving the basis for what will be a whole 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.870
 so strong project that as I say the 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:27.200
 mental and emotional preparation 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.210
 own players starting from the 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.630
 which are the directive and the 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.630
 trainers
