00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.310
 hello, I'm a growing issue 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.430
 specifically how good just something to hang out when I jammed sector if 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.850
 it works in a similar way you see that this way and mobility all over the 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.289
 body because they are all compatible with the sweet and the iss 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:18.750
 come all the mac varieties it's good that I the cinema I come with some 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.859
 applications that are really very diverse and pushes the calculator before 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.439
 to go out 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.209
 between the defendants area aware of the investigation or at least minutes 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.220
 Now I am a people and take care 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.550
 makled more to do 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.100
 fruit of these disputed matches not very well 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.320
 cushions in industry and women 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.680
 I'm not leaving 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.970
 it will be better to have to choose if your 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.830
 do not worry this is not what is here renewed 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:54.130
 last year 114 were identified and the most entrepreneurs practiced sense 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.950
 I think I'm going to stay with friends that 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.300
 new York 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.350
 for that and a psm ring that is what you have there investigating an album 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.040

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.460
 peÃ±arol but for me too 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.540
 Pujols is a beautiful question of how he has done to you, you are not interested in 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.520
 crafts so things both criticized the tie from time to time 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.220
 the step I think that we already tried and we had nothing but pain and frustration 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.210
 how about 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.210

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.980
 100 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.730
 because of that and an embolism is a terrible thing and we have many things in common both 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.190
 are the only cases dose sharing the files is wonderful we take 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.190
 very well 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.050

 all parties actually commented technology mentioned that it worked with 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.860

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.520
