00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.070 

in<00:00:05.730> this<00:00:05.850> lesson<00:00:06.150> we're<00:00:06.450> going<00:00:06.569> to<00:00:06.690> build<00:00:06.899> a

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
in this lesson we're going to build a

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:14.480 
in this lesson we're going to build a
three<00:00:07.319> value<00:00:07.740> and<00:00:08.010> a<00:00:08.370> five<00:00:08.610> value<00:00:09.030> scale<00:00:13.490> and

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
three value and a five value scale and

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.939 
three value and a five value scale and
we<00:00:14.610> start<00:00:14.849> off<00:00:15.000> with<00:00:15.240> just<00:00:15.350> white<00:00:16.350> paint<00:00:16.619> and

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
we start off with just white paint and

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.010 
we start off with just white paint and
black<00:00:17.160> paint<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.699> you'll<00:00:18.330> meet<00:00:18.449> about<00:00:18.690> five

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
black paint and you'll meet about five

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.990 
black paint and you'll meet about five
times<00:00:19.320> as<00:00:19.529> much<00:00:19.710> white<00:00:20.010> as<00:00:20.250> black<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:20.850> you'll

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
times as much white as black and you'll

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.130 
times as much white as black and you'll
see<00:00:21.330> why<00:00:21.539> as<00:00:21.869> we<00:00:22.439> go<00:00:22.560> through<00:00:22.830> this<00:00:23.960> so<00:00:24.960> what

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
see why as we go through this so what

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.179 
see why as we go through this so what
we're<00:00:25.260> going<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.439> do<00:00:25.590> is<00:00:25.740> we're<00:00:25.859> going<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.039> mix

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
we're going to do is we're going to mix

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.580 
we're going to do is we're going to mix
the<00:00:26.369> middle<00:00:26.640> value<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.300> we're<00:00:28.230> going<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.410> try

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
the middle value and we're going to try

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.050 
the middle value and we're going to try
to<00:00:28.650> get<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:28.890> value<00:00:29.279> that's<00:00:29.490> halfway<00:00:29.820> between

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
to get a value that's halfway between

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.540 
to get a value that's halfway between
the<00:00:30.630> two<00:00:31.520> now<00:00:32.520> as<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:32.820> notice<00:00:33.030> as<00:00:33.360> we<00:00:33.510> add<00:00:33.780> the

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
the two now as you notice as we add the

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.560 
the two now as you notice as we add the
black<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:36.500> color<00:00:37.520> rapidly<00:00:38.520> goes<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.149> dark

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
black the color rapidly goes to a dark

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.260 
black the color rapidly goes to a dark
gray<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.579> that's<00:00:41.579> why<00:00:41.790> we<00:00:41.940> need<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.239> have

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
gray and that's why we need to have

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.490 
gray and that's why we need to have
about<00:00:42.570> five<00:00:43.079> times<00:00:43.379> as<00:00:43.590> much<00:00:43.710> white<00:00:43.980> as<00:00:44.250> black

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
about five times as much white as black

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.840 
about five times as much white as black
otherwise<00:00:46.500> this<00:00:46.829> would<00:00:47.010> end<00:00:47.190> up<00:00:47.280> being<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.700> very

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
otherwise this would end up being a very

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.330 
otherwise this would end up being a very
very<00:00:48.120> dark<00:00:48.420> gray<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.710> what<00:00:49.890> we're<00:00:50.039> looking

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
very dark gray and what we're looking

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.569 
very dark gray and what we're looking
for<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.789> middle<00:00:51.210> value<00:00:51.949> now<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.190> was<00:00:53.340> too

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
for is a middle value now that was too

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.689 
for is a middle value now that was too
dark<00:00:54.079> so<00:00:55.079> I'm<00:00:55.469> adding<00:00:55.649> some<00:00:55.980> more<00:00:56.129> white<00:00:56.399> in

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
dark so I'm adding some more white in

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:04.219 
dark so I'm adding some more white in
order<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.329> lighten<00:00:57.930> up<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.289> value<00:00:58.649> a<00:01:03.229> little

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
order to lighten up the value a little

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.020 
order to lighten up the value a little
bit<00:01:04.439> too<00:01:04.650> much<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.159> we'll<00:01:05.309> darken<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.880> little

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
bit too much so we'll darken it a little

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.100 
bit too much so we'll darken it a little
bit<00:01:08.060> notice<00:01:09.060> how<00:01:09.210> I'm<00:01:09.299> mixing<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.869> very

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
bit notice how I'm mixing it very

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.399 
bit notice how I'm mixing it very
thoroughly<00:01:10.380> what<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.369> want<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.670> do<00:01:11.790> when<00:01:12.030> you

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
thoroughly what you want to do when you

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.690 
thoroughly what you want to do when you
when<00:01:13.409> you're<00:01:13.530> building<00:01:13.770> these<00:01:14.040> value<00:01:14.400> scales

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
when you're building these value scales

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.749 
when you're building these value scales
is<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.689> want<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:15.960> have<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.619> very<00:01:16.979> well<00:01:17.460> mixed

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
is you want to have a very well mixed

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.440 
is you want to have a very well mixed
paint<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:18.479> it's<00:01:18.630> just<00:01:18.810> one<00:01:19.200> solid<00:01:19.560> value<00:01:20.159> and

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
paint so it's just one solid value and

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.850 
paint so it's just one solid value and
the<00:01:21.450> knife<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.810> I'm<00:01:21.960> using<00:01:22.200> it's<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.650> long

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
the knife that I'm using it's a long

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.980 
the knife that I'm using it's a long
flexible<00:01:23.220> knife<00:01:23.700> it's<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.060> perfect<00:01:24.450> knife<00:01:24.659> for

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
flexible knife it's a perfect knife for

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.350 
flexible knife it's a perfect knife for
mixing<00:01:25.920> this<00:01:26.070> if<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:26.790> have<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:26.970> knife<00:01:27.180> that's

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
mixing this if you have a knife that's

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.940 
mixing this if you have a knife that's
too<00:01:27.570> short<00:01:27.900> it's<00:01:28.110> much<00:01:28.290> more<00:01:28.500> difficult<00:01:28.860> to

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
too short it's much more difficult to

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:37.690 
too short it's much more difficult to
use

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.610 

just<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.820> little<00:01:38.970> more<00:01:39.210> black<00:01:39.540> darkness<00:01:40.440> a

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:40.620 
just a little more black darkness a

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.500 
just a little more black darkness a
little<00:01:40.830> bit<00:01:40.980> notice<00:01:41.760> I'm<00:01:41.880> very<00:01:42.060> careful<00:01:42.270> about

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
little bit notice I'm very careful about

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.450 
little bit notice I'm very careful about
choosing<00:01:42.960> just<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.380> very<00:01:43.650> small<00:01:43.980> amount<00:01:44.040> of

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
choosing just a very small amount of

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:53.900 
choosing just a very small amount of
dark<00:01:44.760> here<00:01:52.040> and<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.190> takes<00:01:53.340> quite<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.670> lot<00:01:53.790> of

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
dark here and it takes quite a lot of

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.220 
dark here and it takes quite a lot of
time<00:01:54.120> there's<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.420> lot<00:01:54.450> of<00:01:54.660> adjustment<00:01:55.140> that's

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 
time there's a lot of adjustment that's

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.330 
time there's a lot of adjustment that's
needed<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:55.850> this<00:01:56.850> will<00:01:57.030> take<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:58.340> probably

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
needed so this will take you probably

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.470 
needed so this will take you probably
about<00:01:59.580> 15<00:02:00.540> minutes<00:02:00.840> just<00:02:00.900> to<00:02:01.170> do<00:02:01.320> that
