00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.069
 now let's take a look at that smartphone 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:10.620
 is inside open the cover is wrong 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:16.020
 she just sits pretty tight and 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:18.029
 You can damage the nail when removing it from 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.510
 one side by itself she is random 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:26.599
 do not fall off another hurt finger 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:31.199
 also unpleasant and so here we see 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:35.190
 battery two SIM card slots 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:38.370
 let's us and that with them we bullet containers 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:42.210
 see another inaccuracy and maybe 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:45.210
 cheating is his capacity but in this case 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.879
 here it is different for the better 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:52.469
 the capacity was 500 me 1 hour 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.660
 more than what is written on the box under 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.559
 battery as you can see already 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.280
 It is written that the phone is installed a 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:04.439
 person android 4 1 1 system 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:08.250
 also nice little thing is certainly better 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:12.150
 than 40 here is indicated incomprehensible model 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:18.140
 s 9300 let me remind you that samsung galaxy s3 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:21.090
 denoted as oh 9300 however 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.110
 galaxy s3 only work with one sim 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.090
 cards here we see support 2 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:33.240
 they are inserted only under the condition 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:35.100
 no battery and smartphone removal 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.759
 additional special fixers 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.759
 not 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.250
 everything is very simple 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.980
 now quickly deal with the second 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.860
 cover closable on the facial streamer 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:12.530
 cover from perform in such a way that 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.750
 do not overlap the main back 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.590
 the cover can be completely replaced 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.930
 notice their sizes match 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:25.270
 accordingly, he just covers himself 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:28.070
 However, we note that this cover 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:31.190
 this is now in fact in itself is not very 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:43.970
 well done and already moving away 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:49.760
 Immediately you need to check that all 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:52.209
 the latches became their grooves especially here 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.209
 that's it 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:05.850
 all this way you can use 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:09.340
 phone while he became a little thicker 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.980
 about 2-3 millimeters decent 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.750
 pretty magnitude and that's not counting this 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.500
 cover this cover adds more 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.500
 a few millimeters
