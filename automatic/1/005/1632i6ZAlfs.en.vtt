when we talk about what Isaiah was

when we talk about what Isaiah was
talking<00:02:32.100> about<00:02:32.190> money<00:02:32.550> is<00:02:32.670> he<00:02:32.790> referring<00:02:33.090> to

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
talking about money is he referring to

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.820 
talking about money is he referring to
the<00:02:33.360> money<00:02:33.540> it<00:02:33.660> would<00:02:33.780> take<00:02:33.990> him<00:02:34.140> to<00:02:34.350> buy<00:02:34.560> this

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
the money it would take him to buy this

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.890 
the money it would take him to buy this
team<00:02:35.100> outright<00:02:35.580> or<00:02:35.790> doesn't<00:02:36.480> refer<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:36.780> the

team's<00:02:37.260> budget<00:02:38.000> well<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.030> think<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.420> comes<00:02:39.630> down

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
team's budget well I think it comes down

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.260 
team's budget well I think it comes down
to<00:02:40.110> what<00:02:40.290> he<00:02:40.500> has<00:02:40.710> himself<00:02:41.100> his<00:02:41.670> own<00:02:41.790> personal

to what he has himself his own personal

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.240 
to what he has himself his own personal
net<00:02:42.450> worth<00:02:42.480> and<00:02:42.960> his<00:02:43.320> ability<00:02:43.740> to<00:02:43.890> pump<00:02:44.070> money

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
net worth and his ability to pump money

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.820 
net worth and his ability to pump money
into<00:02:44.400> this<00:02:44.760> franchise<00:02:45.060> as<00:02:45.600> it<00:02:46.110> had<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.620> deal

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
into this franchise as it had to deal

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.890 
into this franchise as it had to deal
with<00:02:46.860> growing<00:02:47.580> as<00:02:47.850> a<00:02:47.880> team<00:02:48.030> building<00:02:48.630> a

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
with growing as a team building a

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.570 
with growing as a team building a
championship<00:02:49.560> team<00:02:49.830> and<00:02:49.860> that's<00:02:50.310> a<00:02:50.400> very

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
championship team and that's a very

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.210 
championship team and that's a very
expensive<00:02:50.820> team<00:02:51.330> plus<00:02:51.990> focused<00:02:52.770> the<00:02:52.890> money<00:02:53.070> in

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
expensive team plus focused the money in

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.460 
expensive team plus focused the money in
on<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.460> Air<00:02:53.580> Canada<00:02:53.790> center<00:02:54.390> -<00:02:54.810> very<00:02:55.320> very

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
on the Air Canada center - very very

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.740 
on the Air Canada center - very very
expensive<00:02:56.010> ventures<00:02:56.610> and<00:02:56.790> I<00:02:57.090> think<00:02:57.360> in<00:02:57.510> terms

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
expensive ventures and I think in terms

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.890 
expensive ventures and I think in terms
of<00:02:57.959> his<00:02:58.110> own<00:02:58.290> 9%<00:02:58.530> he<00:02:59.489> felt<00:02:59.760> that<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.420> demands

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
of his own 9% he felt that the demands

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.110 
of his own 9% he felt that the demands
that<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.470> team<00:03:01.709> wanted<00:03:02.100> him<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.340> inject<00:03:02.910> in

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
that the team wanted him to inject in

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.600 
that the team wanted him to inject in
financially<00:03:03.870> were<00:03:04.290> simply<00:03:04.709> not<00:03:05.250> in<00:03:05.430> his

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
financially were simply not in his

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.880 
financially were simply not in his
pockets<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.180> have<00:03:06.330> and<00:03:07.020> I<00:03:07.110> think<00:03:07.320> perhaps<00:03:07.620> the

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
pockets to have and I think perhaps the

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.070 
pockets to have and I think perhaps the
most<00:03:08.100> telling<00:03:08.520> thing<00:03:08.850> he<00:03:09.000> said<00:03:09.330> was<00:03:09.660> when<00:03:09.989> he

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
most telling thing he said was when he

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.900 
most telling thing he said was when he
was<00:03:10.230> asked<00:03:10.560> about<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.860> arena<00:03:11.160> issue<00:03:11.400> he<00:03:11.670> did

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
was asked about the arena issue he did

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.180 
was asked about the arena issue he did
say<00:03:12.150> if<00:03:12.209> it<00:03:12.360> was<00:03:12.480> his<00:03:12.720> call<00:03:13.020> he<00:03:13.590> would<00:03:13.800> not<00:03:14.010> have

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
say if it was his call he would not have

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.620 
say if it was his call he would not have
built<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.520> Air<00:03:14.640> Canada<00:03:15.150> center<00:03:15.420> he<00:03:15.480> would

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
built the Air Canada center he would

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.600 
built the Air Canada center he would
have<00:03:15.720> stayed<00:03:15.900> in<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.170> SkyDome<00:03:16.470> and<00:03:16.950> waited

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
have stayed in the SkyDome and waited

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:18.800 
have stayed in the SkyDome and waited
for<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.880> Leafs<00:03:18.090> and<00:03:18.390> I<00:03:18.420> think<00:03:18.630> that<00:03:18.720> would

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
for the Leafs and I think that would

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:19.970 
for the Leafs and I think that would
have<00:03:18.900> been<00:03:18.930> a<00:03:19.080> round<00:03:19.260> of<00:03:19.380> applause<00:03:19.680> for<00:03:19.950> that

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
have been a round of applause for that

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.220 
have been a round of applause for that
how<00:03:20.190> do<00:03:20.250> you<00:03:20.400> thinking<00:03:20.760> I<00:03:20.940> think<00:03:21.900> you're

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
how do you thinking I think you're

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.720 
how do you thinking I think you're
probably<00:03:22.470> right<00:03:22.770> it<00:03:23.010> was<00:03:23.130> a<00:03:23.160> very<00:03:23.489> very

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
probably right it was a very very

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.000 
probably right it was a very very
telling<00:03:24.209> thing<00:03:24.420> that<00:03:24.630> he<00:03:24.720> told<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.709> entire

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
telling thing that he told the entire

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.740 
telling thing that he told the entire
media<00:03:26.370> gathering<00:03:26.850> he<00:03:27.270> said<00:03:27.480> that<00:03:27.630> he'd

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
media gathering he said that he'd

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:28.880 
media gathering he said that he'd
probably<00:03:27.930> get<00:03:28.140> in<00:03:28.290> trouble<00:03:28.620> from<00:03:28.709> the

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
probably get in trouble from the

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.650 
probably get in trouble from the
commissioner<00:03:29.310> for<00:03:29.459> saying<00:03:29.730> it<00:03:29.940> but<00:03:30.330> that<00:03:30.480> had

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
commissioner for saying it but that had

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.420 
commissioner for saying it but that had
they<00:03:30.870> taken<00:03:31.110> the<00:03:31.350> necessary<00:03:31.620> penalties

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
they taken the necessary penalties

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.120 
they taken the necessary penalties
perhaps<00:03:32.820> as<00:03:33.030> much<00:03:33.180> as<00:03:33.239> 25<00:03:33.840> million<00:03:34.230> dollars<00:03:34.380> to

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
perhaps as much as 25 million dollars to

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.920 
perhaps as much as 25 million dollars to
take<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.520> time<00:03:35.760> out<00:03:35.940> to<00:03:36.120> negotiate<00:03:36.660> with<00:03:36.780> the

would have served the long-term interest
of<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.180> Raptors<00:03:42.510> franchise<00:03:42.630> that<00:03:42.989> much

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350

better
and<00:03:43.950> that<00:03:44.220> brings<00:03:44.430> the<00:03:44.580> problem<00:03:45.000> back<00:03:45.180> to<00:03:45.330> the

original source because it was the NBA
that<00:03:47.670> decided<00:03:48.180> that<00:03:48.330> the<00:03:48.420> Air<00:03:48.570> Canada<00:03:48.870> site<00:03:49.380> is

that decided that the Air Canada site is
the<00:03:50.160> site<00:03:50.190> that<00:03:50.580> they<00:03:50.700> wanted<00:03:51.090> their<00:03:51.269> building

it was the NBA that picked this

what<00:04:03.630> do<00:04:03.720> you<00:04:03.780> think<00:04:03.930> about<00:04:04.140> that<00:04:04.380> I<00:04:04.590> think

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
what do you think about that I think

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.010 
what do you think about that I think
you're<00:04:05.490> right<00:04:05.610> on<00:04:05.819> I<00:04:05.850> think<00:04:06.120> the<00:04:06.390> NBA<00:04:06.510> is<00:04:06.990> a

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
you're right on I think the NBA is a

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.740 
you're right on I think the NBA is a
money<00:04:07.350> now<00:04:07.560> kind<00:04:07.920> of<00:04:08.069> a<00:04:08.100> kind<00:04:08.880> of<00:04:08.970> operation<00:04:09.600> I

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
money now kind of a kind of operation I

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.330 
money now kind of a kind of operation I
think<00:04:09.780> it<00:04:10.140> likes<00:04:10.319> to<00:04:10.500> deal<00:04:10.650> in<00:04:10.830> the<00:04:10.920> present

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
think it likes to deal in the present

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.890 
think it likes to deal in the present
not<00:04:11.459> certain<00:04:11.760> that<00:04:11.850> it's<00:04:12.030> not<00:04:12.270> necessarily

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
not certain that it's not necessarily

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.360 
not certain that it's not necessarily
the<00:04:12.930> future<00:04:13.380> and<00:04:13.620> it's<00:04:13.890> always<00:04:14.160> come<00:04:14.340> down

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
the future and it's always come down

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.280 
the future and it's always come down

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
very hard on expansion franchises

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.409 
very hard on expansion franchises
forcing<00:04:16.950> them<00:04:17.070> to<00:04:17.100> prove<00:04:17.400> their<00:04:17.579> worth<00:04:17.609> to<00:04:18.299> the
