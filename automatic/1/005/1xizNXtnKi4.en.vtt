you<00:01:36.580> know<00:01:36.670> all<00:01:36.880> of<00:01:37.030> our<00:01:37.150> actions<00:01:37.750> here<00:01:37.930> are

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
you know all of our actions here are

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.420 
you know all of our actions here are
tend<00:01:38.320> to<00:01:38.350> be<00:01:38.440> sagittal<00:01:39.040> so<00:01:39.159> they're<00:01:39.280> going

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
tend to be sagittal so they're going

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.310 
tend to be sagittal so they're going
through<00:01:39.580> the<00:01:39.729> through<00:01:40.420> the<00:01:40.540> forward

a lot of us with knee problems the first

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:21.629 
a lot of us with knee problems the first
thing<00:04:20.349> we<00:04:20.440> think<00:04:20.530> about<00:04:20.650> is<00:04:20.859> only<00:04:21.099> the<00:04:21.430> knee

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
thing we think about is only the knee

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:24.960 
thing we think about is only the knee
the<00:04:22.570> thing<00:04:22.810> is<00:04:22.930> is<00:04:23.080> the<00:04:23.200> knee<00:04:23.610> itself<00:04:24.610> is<00:04:24.820> kind

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
the thing is is the knee itself is kind

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.760 
the thing is is the knee itself is kind
of<00:04:25.060> directed<00:04:25.750> by<00:04:25.870> all<00:04:26.139> the<00:04:26.320> muscles<00:04:26.650> and

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
tendons around it so for instance if you

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.770 
tendons around it so for instance if you
tend<00:04:29.740> to<00:04:29.860> have<00:04:30.010> really<00:04:30.280> tight<00:04:30.940> calf<00:04:31.300> muscles
