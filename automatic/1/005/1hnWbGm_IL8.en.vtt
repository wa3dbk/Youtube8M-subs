00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello and welcome to the wow guide 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.899
 how do you get your passengers back? 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.429
 yes some will have noticed it 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.860
 There is no longer a button for the flight 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.070
 so happened is the passengers tabs the 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:18.480
 Of course there is still but I should have 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:21.869
 like the button back and yes blizzard 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.550
 there is a bit yes i find it in 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.199
 DÃ¼sselstrand stupid out that the home- 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.430
 to another and find it good 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.380
 maybe the wasen for the flight 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.420
 do not shape and how to do that 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.369
 getting back is very easy because that 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.890
 Glyph deer causes that one 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.730
 group member on you yourself 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.010
 can sit on it and make it happen 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.260
 you have to be in the old one too 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.030
 world where you can fly and I have 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.649
 recently, all of my lovely unpacked 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.879
 and have the tested and then I have 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.219
 I do the customers for me 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.460
 read through and he is in yours 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.379
 can shape travel now 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.449
 serve group members as right here 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.340
 travel is no longer yours 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.010
 fly and your flight will be shaped as 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.989
 separate ability learns that way or 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.479
 check today is pure and says here 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.970
 is the flight again and me 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.530
 can write here in giving the 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.680
 I do not think I'm stupid now 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.900
 For example, there are enough small checks 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.720
 the beautiful talent a flight there you have to 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.740
 also used to have in shape because I have 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.380
 almost always testing certain stars 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.299
 in it as well as now go like analyzes 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.549
 I do not know how much space they have 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.799
 and grace so that I am less wrong art 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.880
 Now I would have to think twice 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:40.140
 I use the green for owls train from grace 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:42.119
 I always want to trade or exchange separately 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.310
 have designed a button for the flight 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.549
 So I would give the extra button here 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.159
 already ice because sometimes you want to stop 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.049
 also go into the deer and you 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.049
 You have to think about how you do that 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.820
 low glyph space populated flight 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.860
 form yes or no what is yours 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.350
 you want to think in the extra button for 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.570
 have made the flight or not me 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.020
 I'm in favor of it and I really want to 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.969
 without testing that would like to have 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.300
 but since blizzard repeatedly to plants 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:15.170
 have it done just like that and well 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:18.980
 what can you say to head off ? 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.629
 good love bye and biologist 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.580
 what do you say to the flight 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.170
 if you write in the comments 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.030
 I would like the video 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.690
 I 'm sorry about an amon anywhere from 0 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.519
 looking forward 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.560
 then I wish you a nice one 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.269
 bye bye and here and here you can 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.310
 you see what strange people 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:40.150
 always somehow write me here 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.150
