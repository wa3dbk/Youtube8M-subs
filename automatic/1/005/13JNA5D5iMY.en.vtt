 verse as an acid and first ultrabond ex 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.719
 which we use in gel technology is 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.269
 however a derivation product 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.610
 doctor add one thing practically 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.529
 the ultra ex bond would be in place of 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.750
 as she said she would like to call 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.699
 the primer that goes maybe conceals an acid 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.109
 very strong destroy long and deep 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.939
 and that instead goes to reinforce the nail 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.460
 therefore certainly also 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.590
 treatment then we have cristina that yes 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.480
 occupies the training and ti 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.489
 I wanted to ask from the point of view 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.309
 however succeeded are the obstacles 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.410
 natural nail growth than anyway 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.829
 we work with our ger who like 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.440
 we said ultrabond ex which is neutral 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.079
 comparison nails natural and in any case 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.590
 all our products must be used 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.989
 to help grow natural nails 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.149

 collection the new gel collection 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:03.870
 colored cng that the trend 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:08.450
 let's say the tendency of these in art 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.969
 who performed our art rector 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.670
 and in any case we work with four 

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:17.329
 elongation performed elongation 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.860
 christa concer with snow under the nail is 

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:21.740
 natural that is called in bars 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.289
 aquarium and with our new genres 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.770
 in fact we also have semi-transparent 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:31.490
 these gerry trash gel that I just have it 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.420
 said and we have a reconstruction that is 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:38.240
 very thin but long but it is always 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:41.780
 resistant and always does not hinder the 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.060
 grace used the right method of the 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.549
 my company is called kb style however in 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.939
 reality phobias style is a company that 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:52.579
 embodies several sections one 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:55.399
 eco technicians section 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:57.110
 the section instead kb and motion and yes 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.959
 dedicates totally to what the 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.939
 product research and work with 

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:04.039
 nails but only sells therefore for 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:06.560
 professionals and you told me 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:08.539
 anyway you went from being passionate 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.910
 precisely and you managed to create 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.739
 your business as how was the 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.069
 passage which were the steps that 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.930
 you had to face me really wrong 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.959
 it has always been an almost passion 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.620
 manic not in nails or always strÃ  

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:26.720
 taken care of my natural nails or 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:33.069
 practically our latest creations 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:36.010
 which are dedicated to which one of several 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.000
 be free to choose the product 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.030
 by the star 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.260
 brushes because they are thinkable of 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.510
 any techniques been and all tested 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:51.590
 to work at its best and sometimes even 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:54.100
 I say trivial brush can facilitate 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:59.870
 processing at 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:01.610
 to the girls in a fantastic way there 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.860
 they are different forms now I am not 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.330
 just one that he understands but there 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.650
 are different forms to achieve 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.490
 different results 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:13.640
 Exactly there are several brushes for 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:16.760
 different techniques are not in for example 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:20.510
 these 2 brushes here are for 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:23.930
 processing of gel in decoration no e 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.090
 they are very soft they are very easy to 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:30.710
 use to create brushstrokes 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:32.720
 very elegant already its ok these for 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.210
 example are two brushes for working 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.730
 cultural james are very comfortable in 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:40.430
 how much they have the tip that allows us to 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.190
 manage the gel at its best on the surface and 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:46.790
 on the other side they are quite rigid 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:49.640
 no they can be in natural bristle 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:55.340
 that in synthetic arctic bristle from 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:57.250
 exact brush to apply fringe 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:01.400
 this is also a pretty brush 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:04.300
 important as it is created with a 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:09.410
 perfectly straight line perfectly 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:11.600
 smooth that creates us creates irregularities 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.670
 no thickness 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.760
 therefore we can encapsulate in fringe 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.560
 under eviction and sealant it happened 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:23.169
 and then of course our brushes that 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:26.000
 I consider very much more articles 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:29.150
 purchased brushes for decoration 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.840
 with water colors these are colors 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:35.060
 for her free-hand drawing with colors 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.880
 to water there is the number 3 that the more 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:40.220
 big is number 2 smaller for her 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:44.180
 thinner contours for the lines 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:47.670
 own very very small micro all 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.920
 two brushes and 2 brushes at the same time 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:53.130
 and the last two brushes I have from 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:58.050
 present and one of our products of mine 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:05:00.349
 recent are flat and cyclic brushes 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:04.020
 these brushes 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:05.970
 they are thin they are very flat though 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.819
 at the same time they have more body 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:11.189
 long than any other brush like that 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:13.889
 a few hours and you can work longer 

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:16.259
 with a single brushstroke I can do 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:19.259
 even a fingernail a whole flower without 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:23.629
 always having to pick up the color 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:23.629
 here thanks a lot for this too
