00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
really the reality anymore like I mean

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.570 
really the reality anymore like I mean
the<00:02:58.030> odd<00:02:58.120> time<00:02:58.330> you'd<00:02:58.600> be<00:02:58.720> able<00:02:59.019> to<00:02:59.200> edge<00:02:59.580> we

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
and then should try and train at the

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:22.990 
and then should try and train at the
high<00:03:12.050> levels<00:03:12.410> it's<00:03:12.650> not<00:03:12.800> really<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:22.790> great

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
high levels it's not really the great

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.680 
high levels it's not really the great
stress<00:03:23.300> we<00:03:23.480> have<00:03:23.510> now<00:03:23.870> that's<00:03:24.410> senior

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
stress we have now that's senior

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.460 
stress we have now that's senior
international<00:03:26.690> level<00:03:26.900> it's<00:03:27.020> a<00:03:27.080> strengthened

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
international level it's a strengthened

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.410 
international level it's a strengthened
deck<00:03:27.590> that<00:03:27.950> maybe<00:03:28.130> wasn't<00:03:28.400> there<00:03:28.760> three<00:03:29.390> four

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
deck that maybe wasn't there three four

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.809 
deck that maybe wasn't there three four
or<00:03:29.690> five<00:03:29.750> years<00:03:29.959> ago<00:03:30.230> I<00:03:30.620> think<00:03:31.010> that<00:03:31.640> can<00:03:31.790> be

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
or five years ago I think that can be

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:33.460 
or five years ago I think that can be
testament<00:03:32.360> to<00:03:32.540> the<00:03:32.750> work<00:03:32.900> that's<00:03:33.080> done<00:03:33.140> in<00:03:33.290> the
