00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
hey guys I got a bag of locks from

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.140 
hey guys I got a bag of locks from
flywheel<00:00:10.920> over<00:00:11.219> I'll<00:00:11.340> back<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:11.790> he's<00:00:11.910> known

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
flywheel over I'll back and he's known

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.879 
flywheel over I'll back and he's known
to<00:00:12.179> make<00:00:12.420> some<00:00:12.570> pretty<00:00:12.719> nasty<00:00:13.080> lock<00:00:13.530> but<00:00:13.740> this

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
to make some pretty nasty lock but this

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.510 
to make some pretty nasty lock but this
looked<00:00:14.190> like<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.400> standard<00:00:15.350> American<00:00:16.350> easy<00:00:16.770> to

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
looked like a standard American easy to

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.769 
looked like a standard American easy to
pick<00:00:17.820> standard<00:00:18.660> core<00:00:18.960> so<00:00:20.000> it<00:00:21.000> isn't<00:00:21.390> believe

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
pick standard core so it isn't believe

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.859 
pick standard core so it isn't believe
me<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.880> struggled<00:00:23.880> with<00:00:24.029> this<00:00:24.180> for<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.449> while<00:00:24.600> and

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
me I struggled with this for a while and

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.150 
me I struggled with this for a while and
then<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:24.990> noticed<00:00:25.230> something<00:00:25.680> unusual<00:00:25.740> about

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
then I noticed something unusual about

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.320 
then I noticed something unusual about
this<00:00:26.430> lock<00:00:26.670> that<00:00:27.510> maybe<00:00:28.910> flywheel<00:00:29.910> had<00:00:30.179> been

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
this lock that maybe flywheel had been

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.889 
this lock that maybe flywheel had been
in<00:00:30.740> inside<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.130> but<00:00:32.700> no<00:00:33.390> telling<00:00:33.690> what<00:00:33.809> he's

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
in inside of it but no telling what he's

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.060 
in inside of it but no telling what he's
put<00:00:34.020> in<00:00:34.110> there<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.350> doesn't<00:00:34.530> pick<00:00:34.800> like<00:00:35.040> a

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
put in there it doesn't pick like a

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.270 
put in there it doesn't pick like a
normal<00:00:35.399> American<00:00:35.790> but<00:00:36.860> hopefully<00:00:37.860> we<00:00:38.010> can<00:00:38.190> get

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
normal American but hopefully we can get

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.729 
normal American but hopefully we can get
it<00:00:38.340> picked<00:00:38.610> again<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.059> first<00:00:39.239> time<00:00:39.590> took<00:00:40.590> me

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
it picked again the first time took me

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.020 
it picked again the first time took me
about<00:00:40.920> 10<00:00:41.190> minutes<00:00:41.340> because<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.700> thought<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:41.879> was

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
about 10 minutes because I thought I was

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.490 
about 10 minutes because I thought I was
dealing<00:00:42.210> with<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.450> standard<00:00:42.899> America<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.469> I

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
dealing with a standard America and I

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.920 
dealing with a standard America and I
just<00:00:43.710> couldn't<00:00:44.070> find<00:00:44.489> any<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.059> serrated

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
just couldn't find any of the serrated

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.470 
just couldn't find any of the serrated
pins<00:00:46.289> but<00:00:46.620> let's<00:00:47.070> see<00:00:47.250> what<00:00:47.370> we<00:00:47.430> got<00:00:47.550> here<00:00:47.610> all

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
pins but let's see what we got here all

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.420 
pins but let's see what we got here all
right<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.110> spring-loaded<00:00:49.530> core<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.370> you

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
right it is a spring-loaded core so you

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.180 
right it is a spring-loaded core so you
got<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.730> kind<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:51.059> use<00:00:51.809> moderate<00:00:52.770> tension<00:00:52.920> to

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
got to kind of use moderate tension to

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.799 
got to kind of use moderate tension to
overcome<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:53.760> spring<00:00:54.059> tension<00:00:54.449> but<00:00:54.570> don't

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
overcome that spring tension but don't

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.450 
overcome that spring tension but don't
push<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:55.260> hard<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.770> bind<00:00:56.010> everything

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
push so hard that you bind everything

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.160 
push so hard that you bind everything
you<00:00:57.239> just<00:00:57.360> want<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.629> bind<00:00:57.809> up<00:00:57.989> one<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.770> them<00:00:58.920> and

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
you just want to bind up one of them and

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.319 
you just want to bind up one of them and
see<00:01:01.170> if<00:01:01.199> i<00:01:01.289> can<00:01:01.469> get<00:01:02.160> my<00:01:02.309> tension<00:01:02.699> right<00:01:02.910> here<00:01:03.180> a

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
see if i can get my tension right here a

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.760 
see if i can get my tension right here a
little<00:01:04.140> bit<00:01:04.320> more<00:01:04.970> okay<00:01:06.229> 33<00:01:07.229> gave<00:01:07.409> me<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.590> little

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
little bit more okay 33 gave me a little

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:24.319 
little bit more okay 33 gave me a little
clique<00:01:08.570> is<00:01:09.570> like<00:01:09.600> four<00:01:14.630> and<00:01:16.070> two<00:01:18.710> that's<00:01:19.710> one

and now three again and five and he's

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:45.250 
and now three again and five and he's
probably<00:01:34.359> set

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.240 

I<00:01:45.350> was<00:01:46.100> three<00:01:46.400> again<00:01:46.640> Oh<00:01:47.800> eat<00:01:48.800> something<00:01:49.070> just

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
on one gotta click out of him and

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.550 
on one gotta click out of him and
there's<00:02:04.670> three<00:02:04.910> and<00:02:05.150> i<00:02:05.180> got<00:02:05.300> a<00:02:05.330> deep<00:02:05.660> fault<00:02:06.170> set

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
there's three and i got a deep fault set

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.389 
there's three and i got a deep fault set
this<00:02:07.490> is<00:02:07.670> when<00:02:07.850> I<00:02:07.880> knew<00:02:07.970> things<00:02:08.420> weren't<00:02:08.750> quite

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
this is when I knew things weren't quite

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.390 
this is when I knew things weren't quite
standard<00:02:10.399> American<00:02:11.590> pins<00:02:12.590> inside<00:02:12.950> of<00:02:13.130> here

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.010 
it I'm on pin 2 and I'm getting a little
bit<00:02:26.360> of<00:02:26.450> feedback<00:02:26.630> a<00:02:27.230> lot<00:02:28.480> of<00:02:29.480> tension<00:02:29.810> on<00:02:29.900> this

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
bit of feedback a lot of tension on this

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.420 
bit of feedback a lot of tension on this
lock<00:02:32.410> got<00:02:33.410> a<00:02:33.440> release<00:02:33.800> and<00:02:33.830> probably

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
lock got a release and probably

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.100 
lock got a release and probably
something's<00:02:34.760> going<00:02:34.910> to<00:02:34.970> drop<00:02:35.180> on<00:02:35.420> here<00:02:38.110> okay

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
we lost something we lost our fault set

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.860 
we lost something we lost our fault set
and<00:02:42.709> there<00:02:42.890> we<00:02:42.980> go<00:02:43.190> unbelievable<00:02:44.090> let<00:02:44.630> me<00:02:44.720> show

and there we go unbelievable let me show
you<00:02:44.900> what<00:02:45.110> flywheel<00:02:45.500> has<00:02:45.620> done<00:02:45.860> to<00:02:46.010> this<00:02:46.160> thing

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
you what flywheel has done to this thing

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.780 
you what flywheel has done to this thing
I<00:02:47.530> didn't<00:02:48.530> really<00:02:48.680> realize<00:02:48.830> until<00:02:49.489> I<00:02:49.520> look

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
I didn't really realize until I look
