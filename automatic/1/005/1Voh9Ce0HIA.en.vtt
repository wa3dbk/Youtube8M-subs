00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
through it because I haven't had enough

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.030 
through it because I haven't had enough
time<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:24.030> it's<00:01:24.420> possibly<00:01:24.960> something<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.530> will

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
time and it's possibly something I will

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.760 
time and it's possibly something I will
go<00:01:26.189> back<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.670> when<00:01:26.850> i<00:01:26.880> do<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.119> time<00:01:27.509> um<00:01:29.000> yes<00:01:30.000> so

the<00:01:31.770> official<00:01:31.950> guide<00:01:32.280> gear<00:01:32.549> says<00:01:32.790> over<00:01:33.180> a

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
the official guide gear says over a

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.929 
the official guide gear says over a
hundred<00:01:33.540> maps<00:01:33.920> every<00:01:34.920> side<00:01:35.159> quest<00:01:35.490> detailed

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
hundred maps every side quest detailed

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.870 
hundred maps every side quest detailed
over<00:01:36.299> 300<00:01:36.840> pages<00:01:37.049> so<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.310> sort<00:01:38.790> of

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
over 300 pages so this sort of

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.780 
over 300 pages so this sort of
corresponds<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.810> what<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.560> think<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.189> not

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
corresponds to what I think of it not

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.730 
corresponds to what I think of it not
the<00:01:41.850> game<00:01:42.299> itself<00:01:42.689> but<00:01:42.960> I'm<00:01:43.110> just<00:01:43.259> saying<00:01:43.500> the

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
the game itself but I'm just saying the

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.609 
the game itself but I'm just saying the
style<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.700> fallout<00:01:45.270> 3<00:01:45.810> where<00:01:46.409> you're

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
style of it is fallout 3 where you're

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.219 
style of it is fallout 3 where you're
