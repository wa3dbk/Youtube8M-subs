00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
contains brute force save data and this

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.549 
contains brute force save data and this
is<00:00:32.910> actually<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.270> really<00:00:33.420> awesome<00:00:33.630> tool<00:00:33.989> that

is actually a really awesome tool that
you<00:00:34.680> guys<00:00:34.860> can<00:00:35.130> convert<00:00:35.520> these<00:00:36.090> differences

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
you guys can convert these differences

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.780 
you guys can convert these differences
so<00:00:37.380> once<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:37.620> install<00:00:37.649> it<00:00:38.160> go<00:00:38.579> through<00:00:38.730> the

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
so once you install it go through the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.030 
so once you install it go through the
regular<00:00:39.090> process<00:00:39.120> here<00:00:39.829> install<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:40.920> you'll

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
regular process here install it you'll

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.560 
regular process here install it you'll

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
get this screen once the screen actually

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.040 
get this screen once the screen actually
comes<00:00:42.960> up<00:00:43.230> you'd<00:00:43.469> want<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.829> go<00:00:44.370> over<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.050> drag
