00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello everyone I propose now 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.359
 to see a little bit different 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.160
 rules of travel concerning 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.019
 riders for that I prepared a 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.150
 file in which I realized 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.219
 screenshots so that's this file 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.010
 so here you have a chessboard on 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.900
 which you have a white jumper and 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.180
 represent by black pellets here 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.760
 all possible moves for the 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.449
 rider agree then you have to know 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.429
 that a rider can move in it 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.980
 okay and we have to count three boxes 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.969
 for moving so nothing of a small 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.040
 little rider here it is in c4 ca 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.450
 initial position and the different 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.750
 possible moves are as follows 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:48.629
 so there are three boxes in l1 2 3 1 2 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:54.270
 So he can come here and there but 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:01:08.040
 still one two three there but still 1 2 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:10.380
 3 1 and 8 1 2 3 1 2 3 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.280
 okay so moving the rider 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.990
 a little bit special 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.909
 so I repeat they move without 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.490
 she and we must count three boxes 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.890
 then a particularity to know for 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.759
 moving the rider the rider 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.799
 is the only piece that can jump 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:28.259
 other pieces his own pieces to himself 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.850
 or that of the opponent agree so 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.159
 like that riders ben bella the 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.200
 opportunity to jump feet this 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.470
 version his own pieces then the 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.119
 better 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.790
 as usual spread on chisty 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:44.100
 time and simulate a part so 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:46.829
 it's gone so I'll have the 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.540
 whites and I'm going to settle for 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.750
 move the riders and my opponent 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.880
 he will play the parts he wants 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.130
 so let's go then I remember 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.750
 that here we light up pawns so for 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.880
 start we have two possibilities actually 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.890
 Care pawns or simple dishes 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.840
 moved riders why because I 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.360
 reminds the rider the possibility of 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.619
 skip some chords so that I 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.349
 select here this jumper 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.660
 then for the possible displacements 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.390
 it's the following 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:18.530
 so I count 2 3 so I can come 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.190
 either here or then 1 2 3 is there then 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.480
 Ideally 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.400
 at the beginning when we do not know very well 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.700
 played we go in parties chose 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.130
 the option and we still choose to display 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.420
 movements validly agree and in 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:34.240
 blue appear displacements 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:36.320
 possible so for example I come here 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.950
 so I played them my opponent 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.180
 so here I will think a little bit 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.600
 what are my possible moves 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.250
 I can already go back okay 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.050
 the riders can revive 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.030
 can back off okay so I can 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:56.360
 go there but I can also go 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:59.720
 here okay keep a little bit of us 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:03.890
 so one two three I can go where 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:07.970
 still 2-3 I can come here or again 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.290
 one two three come here ok so if 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.720
 I click here in blue will appear 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.910
 the different boxes that I'm going 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.810
 to be able to occupy with the Canadian 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.630
 okay, that's the one I gave 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:24.740
 clearly then for example come here ta 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:26.840
 life so my opponent also has to 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:30.200
 play move the jumper so his 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.540
 initial position was here look 1 2 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.500
 3 he came there no problem 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.510
 I'm going to move my other 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.570
 jumper there is here of displacements 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:46.730
 possible on this box or on those 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:49.430
 you 're coming here so here I'm going to do 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.470
 attention because my rider who 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.150
 alas is at the mercy of this pawn so if 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.860
 I do not move this jumper I risk 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.120
 to make me eat good is not very serious 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.870
 it's a simulation it's for you 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.300
 show a little bit how that 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.560
 works i'll leave it there by 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.080
 against the cavaliere iliad a little bit 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:07.070
 I will move it and I will come 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:09.470
 1 2 3 eat his piece his pawn that is 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.830
 there okay it a little bit if I'm 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.840
 above 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:16.250
 I have several possible trips in 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.870
 blue and red was told that I can 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.080
 to eat one of those pieces that's what 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.080
 I want to do 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.080
 so he came to eat with his 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.210
 cavalier his calm said was there 1 2 3 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.000
 he came here and so on 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.070
 okay so a little summary a 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.830
 jumper moves in it and it takes 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.990
 count three chord boxes the jumper 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.450
 can move in advance by retreating 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.979
 on the sides there is no problem 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.900
 last thing to know the rider the 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:47.210
 only piece that can jump others 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:51.220
 pieces the feet of the opponent or his 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.220
 own pieces here I thank you
