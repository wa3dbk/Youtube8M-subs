00:00:04.348 --> 00:00:07.148
What do we believe to hold infinite power?

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.660
Power mixed with hatred and lust for revenge equals disaster.

00:00:17.374 --> 00:00:22.254
Two enemies at constant war aggravate the balance between good and evil.

00:00:22.751 --> 00:00:24.831
Causing inexplicable deaths.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.120
I will find you.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.400
Even if I have to work my way through everybody...

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.080
I will find you.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.540
You stood in front of me and watched me break down, causing the end of me.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.840
I will be the death of you, as you will be the death of me.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.760
Your death... Is my redemption.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.660
I can change the world... (Help, help!)

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.100
But I don't want to.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.040
Does the rage in my enemy's heart begin The Passing?

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.080
I wasn't always evil.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.900
Something... Happened.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.220
No! (Scream echoes)

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.800
My name is Detective Sergeant Jacobs.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.053
I have been the victim of a disaster,

00:01:40.053 --> 00:01:42.503
Set up for crimes I did not commit,

00:01:42.503 --> 00:01:44.863
For a reason I'll probably never know of.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.680
"I will kill you, Jacobs."

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.720
Revenge will be sought upon the innocents...

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.580
Until the truth will out.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.120
For their redemption, to rise.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.860
So, D.S Jacobs.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.320
I presume you understand that the evidence is building up in this case.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.780
On that basis, I really do need to suspend you immediately.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.040
Do you believe in immortality?

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.700
The whole time...

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.200
I knew it was you.
