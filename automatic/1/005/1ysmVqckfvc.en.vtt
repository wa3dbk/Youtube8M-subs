 we had Saturday next week that 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.920

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.349
 classes and I'm also going to send a greeting 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.930
 especially those I 'm going to know about this 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:20.209
 Friday in the city of Caracas where 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.830
 we will also be with curtains and 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:26.060
 shutters as we promised the year 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:28.790
 passed since early January with 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.230
 the girls of caracas so good 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.730
 caracas this Friday there we go very well 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.760
 above the mind I do not have a very 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.010
 very pretty that although it is very beautiful they 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.519
 I'm going to confess that it cost me a little bit 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.410
 the time to meet her because she is 100% 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.170
 polyester that is almost cottonless 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.640
 that means that's it already like that in 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.069
 common or violent color is 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.080
 truly spectacular that all those who 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.060
 we are here we fell in love with this cloth 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.000
 we would love to have the whole kitchen 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.870
 decorated with it is extremely economical 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.810
 really 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:07.099
 the accessible woman and in a store that 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.940
 they were several places the web has 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:12.390
 fifteen 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:15.030
 and your window to decorate my 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:19.650
 from a street or you are going to buy 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:21.750
 three meters will have to be left over 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.460
 half a meter left over to me but I'm going to 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.420
 make a few individual one has a 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.099
 claw pot 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.980
 to finish decorating this 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:31.050
 cook so if it does not matter better 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:36.209
 because they might go back and 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:38.400
 do not get the same curtain let's go 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.830
 first as the classes to part of the 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.530
 theory and then we 're going to go to 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.600
 to practice 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.450
 the graph that you should have in the 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.900
 notebook is the next thank you guys 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.970
 If the window measures one meter, you 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:58.069
 they are going to cut a rectangle of fabric that 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:01.319
 Measure 258 the double and a half of your window 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:03.740
 250 is double and a half and its window and 8 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:07.220
 are the hedges that are going to do 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:09.560
 and they're always going to cut it out of 47 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.320
 centimeters tall which is the measure 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:15.440
 universal height of a valance more 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:18.860
 the respective increases for what happened 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.360
 the draper repeating summarizing they're going to 

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.030
 cut a rectangle of cloth that goes to 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:25.430
 have 47 high for 252 hours 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.780
 surely they will have to tie 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.540
 strips 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.639
 for the leaves you are going to cut two 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.560
 pieces that have the height of the 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.540
 window do not do any kind of 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.250
 increase because these two sheets are already going to 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.610
 see today in the program bread inside 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:45.990
 this seed because the exact height of 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:47.910
 the window and half of all 58 years 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.669
 here we did the 2 hours because these 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:54.180
 two leaves go inside these fins and 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:56.250
 then finally the handles with 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.690
 the wood grabs the pieces that are 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.910
 to tie up for that I also say that 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.430
 it does not matter of serreta quoted that it is going to us 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.720
 To spare fabric because everything together 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.000
 you have to prepare it like that so I 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.810
 I imagine you did this 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.150
 graphic on in the notebook they have of 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.890
 our house seeing once that 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.900
 they prepared that we go for the cloth myself 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.669
 I have enough I understand I bought myself 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.470
 all the roll I said to you 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:21.270
 buy for my boss for my question 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:24.540
 now for sonia she wants her 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:27.930
 curtain with these colors of the base 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:30.300
 very well there it is then I bought 5 nothing 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:33.390
 more because her window is more 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.620
 It measured as large as it almost 2 meters 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.830
 first what are you going to do with you 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.240
 come from the store is to straighten the fabric 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.610
 I go back and I repeat, do not leave me 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.470
 distress you notice that straightens 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.300
 the fabric and it continues as if left twisted 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.820
 because this is a fabric that moves a 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.860
 little when they are working as 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.440
 let's prevent that good simply 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:56.300
 let's grab our pins let's go 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.300
 to make a row of pins 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.400
 of live thanks 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.350
 and there's my row now they're going to grab 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:12.440
 the rule will support her here 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:15.170
 exactly the side of the fabric 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:17.840
 making a square and with a pencil and a 

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:21.050
 chalk what you have marker what 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:24.080
 that they have are going to mark the line for 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:27.710
 the perfect fit and fabric right 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:30.530
 I have again I come back and I repeat the band aid 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:33.470
 is given through play a little bit there 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:37.790
 is and then now if they are going to grab 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:39.830
 the scissors and the havana to straighten 

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:41.969
 work backwards from you so that I 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:45.409
 see well 

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:45.409
 there we are cutting 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:57.570
 and there we removed the crooked thing that was 

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:59.880
 when we cut it in the store look 

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:02.730
 how it looks perfect pretty crooked 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.710
 good ready now now this 

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:06.660
 right good once we have it 

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:09.510
 right-wingers and let's take out the valance 

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:11.670
 that measures 47 centimeters tall already 

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.990
 We are also going to prepare the 

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:15.120
 iron because today we will be 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.950
 working and am indications with the 

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:20.690
 griddle 

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:20.690
 let's make a small cut
