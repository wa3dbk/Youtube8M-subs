00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.940
 it's a very rewarding career 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.940
 and very challenging 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.070
 the chemist is a professional with 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.200
 deep scientific knowledge 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.480
 about the subject and its 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.240
 transformations works mainly 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.099
 in the laboratory and deals with 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.680
 find new substances to 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.690
 solve problems of daily life 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.300
 the chemical engineer on the other hand 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.850
 occupies mostly of the part to scale 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.520
 industrial to produce those substances 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.129
 to meet those needs to great 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.860
 scale deals with the design of 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.610
 plants that the operation of plants of 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:58.190
 get a production of all those 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.190
 substances in an economical way 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.630
 at first it was a little hard for the 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:20.110
 done leaving my house and now everything 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:24.299
 new and did not know sevilla but good 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.299
 You really looked at me pretty well 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.460
 it is true that studying an exam does not 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.590
 like nobody but when you pass the 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.390
 time and you see that what you have studied in 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.280
 that exam you can really put in 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.280
 practice is rewarding 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.030
 a game of transparency with my 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.409
 friends and evenings of worked with 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.750
 them from the study room and then 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.750
 here a problem that brandon to the head 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.470
 of that thing was tuning has good 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.470
 memories the race 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:03.910
 the school was founded almost 50 years ago 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:07.030
 years are currently taught in it 8 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:10.509
 bachelor 's degrees and 12 master's degrees at about 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.869
 6,000 students counting for it with 500 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.869
 teachers 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.920
 and at the end you see that you are prepared to 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.549
 solve a lot of problem that you 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.549
 you saw incapable 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.730
 really chemical engineering is very 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.070
 present in our day to day from the 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.480
 diesel or your car's gasoline up 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.970
 the treatment of your waste 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.980
 city thinks about the materials of its 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.840
 mobile phone or the clothes you saw 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.180
 the medicines the products of 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.530
 cleaning all of them come from processes 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.530
 designed with chemical engineering 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.120
 that sometimes it 's true that the race is 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.590
 very hard because you think it's not going to 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.060
 give time that you will not be able to 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.560
 take the subjects the times of 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.660
 exams are very overwhelming you can not 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.160
 sleep but once the 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.780
 satisfaction is so great that you 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.780
 you think everything was worth it
