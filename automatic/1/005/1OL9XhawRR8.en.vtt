textbooks<00:02:23.740> tell<00:02:23.980> us<00:02:24.100> to<00:02:24.280> apply<00:02:24.580> color<00:02:24.940> and

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
textbooks tell us to apply color and

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.480 
textbooks tell us to apply color and
Lightner<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:26.200> half<00:02:26.500> an<00:02:26.650> inch<00:02:26.830> from<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.220> scalp

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.940 
and a half an inch from the ends but in
reality<00:02:30.270> it<00:02:31.270> we<00:02:31.540> should<00:02:31.810> apply<00:02:32.380> the<00:02:32.410> color<00:02:32.830> a

on and off the scalp lightning we will
continue<00:02:53.770> to<00:02:53.860> process<00:02:54.160> until<00:02:55.030> we<00:02:55.060> have

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
continue to process until we have

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.690 
continue to process until we have
reached<00:02:55.330> the<00:02:55.750> red-orange<00:02:56.260> stage<00:02:56.800> which<00:02:57.670> is

step3<00:03:08.860> rinse<00:03:09.760> shampoo<00:03:10.200> and<00:03:11.200> dry

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.480 

step<00:03:16.660> 3<00:03:17.320> apply<00:03:18.130> our<00:03:18.490> copper<00:03:19.060> base<00:03:19.270> color<00:03:20.490> next

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.490 
step 3 apply our copper base color next

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.580 
step 3 apply our copper base color next
we<00:03:21.760> will<00:03:21.880> apply<00:03:22.240> our<00:03:22.570> color<00:03:22.600> to<00:03:23.200> the<00:03:23.320> mid-shaft

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
we will apply our color to the mid-shaft

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.150 
we will apply our color to the mid-shaft
first<00:03:24.400> this<00:03:25.210> is<00:03:25.360> one<00:03:25.630> way<00:03:25.810> to<00:03:25.840> avoid<00:03:26.440> hot<00:03:26.800> roots

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
first this is one way to avoid hot roots

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.330 
first this is one way to avoid hot roots
we<00:03:28.090> will<00:03:28.270> let<00:03:28.420> this<00:03:28.600> process<00:03:28.870> for<00:03:29.500> 10<00:03:29.710> to<00:03:29.890> 15

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
we will let this process for 10 to 15

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.210 
we will let this process for 10 to 15
minutes<00:03:30.700> then<00:03:31.660> we<00:03:31.900> will<00:03:32.050> apply<00:03:32.380> to<00:03:32.530> the<00:03:32.890> scalp

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
minutes then we will apply to the scalp

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.970 
minutes then we will apply to the scalp
area<00:03:33.490> and<00:03:33.940> hair<00:03:34.360> ends<00:03:34.810> and<00:03:35.410> we<00:03:35.530> will<00:03:35.680> allow

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
area and hair ends and we will allow

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.920 
area and hair ends and we will allow
that<00:03:36.010> to<00:03:36.310> process<00:03:36.670> for<00:03:37.270> 35<00:03:37.900> to<00:03:38.320> 50<00:03:38.740> minutes

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
that to process for 35 to 50 minutes

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.990 
that to process for 35 to 50 minutes
again<00:03:40.930> you<00:03:41.110> want<00:03:41.290> to<00:03:41.350> use<00:03:41.410> fine<00:03:42.000> subsections

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
again you want to use fine subsections

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.420 
again you want to use fine subsections
so<00:03:43.390> that<00:03:43.540> you<00:03:43.720> can<00:03:43.900> have<00:03:44.140> good<00:03:44.500> and<00:03:44.890> complete

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
so that you can have good and complete

00:03:45.430 --> 00:04:03.490 
so that you can have good and complete
color<00:03:45.790> coverage

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.390 

step<00:04:04.190> 3<00:04:04.850> rents<00:04:05.570> color<00:04:05.920> shampoo<00:04:06.920> and<00:04:07.160> condition

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
step 3 rents color shampoo and condition

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.490 
step 3 rents color shampoo and condition
so<00:04:10.400> here<00:04:10.640> is<00:04:10.760> our<00:04:10.940> finished<00:04:11.120> result<00:04:11.510> and<00:04:12.320> as

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
so here is our finished result and as

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.680 
so here is our finished result and as
you<00:04:12.650> can<00:04:12.830> see<00:04:12.890> we<00:04:13.460> have<00:04:13.640> achieved<00:04:13.790> a<00:04:14.180> beautiful
