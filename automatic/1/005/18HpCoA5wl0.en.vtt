00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:14.059
 Hello dear friends today will 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.010
 such a small video preview double so 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.720
 let's call him 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.189
 First I want to tell you a little about 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.140
 what you see in the picture now 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.510
 that some time ago to me 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:27.380
 Representatives of the site turned ura.ru 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:29.060
 and offered this option of cooperation 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.980
 which seemed to me very personal 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.660
 interesting they offered me to send 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.039
 some knives of your choice 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.690
 but actually what they stopped you 

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:37.730
 Now you see such a box in the frame and 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.710
 asked how to show them on 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.360
 the channel can make a video about their work 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.950
 maybe just thank for the gift 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.820
 item in this approximately the form with them 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.579
 to interact 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.950
 I decided that perhaps that I have 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.180
 thematic pr promotion from this site and 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.660
 agreed to this option 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.880
 his own today were delivered 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.980
 before me here are our wonderful 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.510
 everything is good as if I came to such 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.399
 I am a man of remarkable dexterity 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.189
 let me plastic packaging here 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.770
 through the morning clean and show you here 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:08.810
 the knives that came to me today 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.460
 a gift that we must 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.310
 try to use it because for 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.049
 I personally have this but this category of knives 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.909
 which was not only me never 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:18.290
 I think that even many viewers 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.030
 of the hoof channel they are most likely not 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.549
 faced with similar knives deal in 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.010
 that as far as I understand today from 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.290
 site this here so appeared not so 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.939
 long time on the website samara.ru series of knives 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.409
 which is called kiraman titan 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.659
 that is, in general, they are from themselves 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.150
 represent quite ordinary ceramic 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.430
 knives that are unusual because 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.320
 made titanium plating well 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.610
 or 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.560
 so here it all comes in very 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.450
 so nice nice such a box and 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.950
 look like this if you take a closer look 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.630
 the knife that is either first it seems that 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.369
 the rest but if you look at it 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.619
 more attentively I think that now the frame 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.090
 will be seen at least in high 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.619
 as a ceramic knife here 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.540
 ceramic edge with a supply with 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:00.890
 laser sharpening is traditionally dealing with on 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:02.509
 such knives like this 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.780
 plastic but very pleasant to the touch 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:08.390
 actually handles in this case 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.909
 we are dealing with such a set of 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.920
 three knives here as I understand 2 chefs here 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:14.239
 it means different size here 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.700
 even fell on the back of the box 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.319
 indicated 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.730
 which one is this size yes here 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.950
 everything is drawn here that is 16,145 meters 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.790
 other 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:29.500
 175 and and divide by iv 125 millimeters here 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.760
 actually here's out of the box so 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.349
 of course it was necessary not to turn over 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.580
 close first but like this knives 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:39.640
 let's take a closer look 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.410
 but I sort of say for whom I give you them 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.450
 showing this thing with this 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.790
 average chef I'm a little bit today 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.739
 I tried to cut well, in general, honestly 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.269
 I will say cope with the work for which 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.450
 designed quite worthy of me 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:54.040
 pleased so let's say I honestly 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.450
 the first moment when to make knives for me here 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.099
 so it seemed that on the butt they 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.290
 pretty fat but when i'm today 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:01.750
 compare with my knives and series 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.640
 tramontina pro it turned out that these knives 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.130
 on the butt is even slightly thinner but not 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.829
 less as if the descent here is not of a butt 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.940
 here you can see how they are made 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.260
 let's see how it will work 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.810
 specific feature seemed 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.160
 the absence of such a sharpened tip i 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.690
 I really don't know how much this is a feature 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.420
 all ceramic knives but nonetheless 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.400
 here are the tips here and even 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.400
 on the little one itself therefore telekinesis 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.359
 I honestly thought that this knife 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.160
 designed mainly for cutting 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:28.600
 vegetables that he may have spicy 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.250
 the tip of something to pick something up 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.410
 let's say in the potato eyes you say 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.880
 what to do but no either 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.519
 so I will try how it works 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.470
 look rather curious well in 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.000
 anyway i want to say big 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.220
 Thanks for the gift because in any 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.250
 the case of gifts, I always get a nice 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.230
 I hope that this gift is so much 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.750
 worthy looks will be worthy too 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.090
 work afterwards the second one today 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.769
 Well , well, to be honest, it's still me 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.569
 probably the more pleasant thing is that 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:04:00.160
 today as a result not so long ago 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:02.769
 announced on the site on the site on 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.109
 channel sorry sharing came to me 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:09.380
 Here is such a knife entered not 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:13.640
 exchange I gave for him 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.960
 zero tolerance 05 05 50 here and came to 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.770
 I've got such a wonderful one 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:21.410
 legs I want to say that I am Eugene 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:23.030
 I hope that this will be for you as well. 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.390
 well, at least for me personally 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.680
 this exchange for just golden of the total not 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.380
 to you for being me 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.090
 offered this knife because if you 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.680
 as you say love crowbar and you 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.930
 so zero tolerance on the same more 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.060
 interesting is generally pure 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.520
 aesthetically, these are the knives 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.860
 Bench we are well, just probably the most 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.480
 most my great love and not 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.040
 absolutely not due and some workers 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.200
 characteristics but just because I 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.610
 really like how it's all done i 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.770
 today, to be honest this knife in hand 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.080
 picked up and stuck that is its functional 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.610
 features we 'll talk something else 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.470
 Eugene warned me of the fact that 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.000
 I personally have the first knife in the collection 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.850
 so which party are you first 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.350
 production 670 of a thousand came to me 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:07.400
 today from finland i managed it 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.570
 get stalin 390 i'm honest when 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.950
 imagined that it was a knife a few 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.540
 less proved that it is quite 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.850
 some kind of full size so good 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.770
 folder 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:17.000
 and as far as I understand it can be me 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.500
 Of course I am mistaken in this case 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.820
 information because I will do a review 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.590
 sure to check but in my opinion it is 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.780
 The first knife of the company is business divided by 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.180
 bearings, that is, I do n’t know how much 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.830
 here we can show us in general 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.400
 that there are absolutely definitely 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.530
 bearings 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.630
 here that is a very so soft glory dan 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.970
 I was warned about it 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:38.270
 like this movement just fall out 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:40.070
 but nevertheless, as if perfectly 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.290
 a delicious opening that is just 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.150
 strict with upset he generally from 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.920
 the whiffs of the wind are quite like that 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.020
 easy to do it all so wonderful 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.960
 completely snap this new hilt 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.550
 such a pen is very subtle here 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.440
 so pretty snappy, oddly enough 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.600
 despite 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.340
 so let's say that such a knife is enough 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.090
 fine in general guys well honestly tell 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.160
 complete delight 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.050
 I haven't had any 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.240
 opportunities to look at the knife . which the 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.730
 I've never seen this before. 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.380
 just such a case here in general 

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.510
 special thanks for such a wonderful 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.190
 the exchange also pleased me very well 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.750
 accordingly some popolzuyus 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.210
 looked to be sure to work 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:20.060
 there will be a review on this knife as well as on 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.870
 company knives presented today 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.240
 samuro 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:26.500
 I hope that you were interested in a lot 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.500
 thanks for watching bye
