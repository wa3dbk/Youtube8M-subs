00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.290
 hello everyone my name is Nina I'm glad 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.870
 greet you on your channel 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.789
 Today we will talk about the brand on the fence 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.500
 shop the fact is that I live in the city and 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.410
 relaxed and we recently opened 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.749
 shopping center aura where the store opened 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:27.779
 for body shop and I decided to look there 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:30.869
 and buy something to watch something from 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.940
 the brand had never been ordered here 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.950
 and decided so let's say go personally 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.800
 see what I ordered is not very 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.079
 much rather bought not very much 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.309
 cosmetics care decorative and want 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.039
 tell you about your first 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.680
 impressions of acquaintance with this brand 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:50.660
 so let's look at the first thing 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.070
 bought why I want to say ordered it 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.980
 foundation for body shop 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.609
 this cream moisturizing effect 30 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.940
 milliliters chance dad I can say 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.620
 that it is lightweight with medium coating 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.780
 evens out skin tone but won't hide 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.520
 some big problems so when 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.730
 having big skin problems 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.439
 still worth using powdered cream 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.720
 Again, repeat the cradle so on my 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.240
 look he is more suitable for the summer for 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.570
 me it is a little bit darkish but how would 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.270
 such a strong difference between for example neck 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.369
 and I don’t notice very well 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.890
 feathers at the borders practically 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.439
 can't see anything so i love him but 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.360
 Again, I repeat all the same light for 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.640
 I will love me more dense 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.680
 Coverage still you put on the summer 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.049
 I forgot to say this cream in my 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.549
 Shade 02, respectively, in my opinion, whether 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.490
 was not number one whether he was 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.710
 very very light I sat in shade 02 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.070
 the next thing i took is crumbly 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.039
 extra virgin powder there is no puff 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:57.149
 there is she here without a puff then he 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:02:00.570
 her 205 she mats well this powder 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.310
 she's good cover basically even me 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.840
 I can say the same as the tone 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.939
 cream if we just apply 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.950
 moisturizer and on top of this powder 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:12.300
 thats the same effect basically 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.030
 the coating will be exactly the same even 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.890
 some problems will hide more than 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.540
 concealer single only 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.120
 I have a problem with the distribution of this 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.980
 Powder the matter is that something is a shade again 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.550
 the same patel doesn't need anything else 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.200
 that but I can say that when I put 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.390
 her so not very big tassel 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.580
 kabuki she is stained then in 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.950
 hard to shade so i take 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.560
 big brush I shade first on 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:42.319
 hand and then put on face then 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:45.150
 it falls evenly and not 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.250
 stained everything is fine but as I only 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.870
 I want to put more powder at once 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.260
 some dark ones begin 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.730
 stains are possible if there were 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:57.300
 lighter perhaps no such problems 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.760
 did not know but besides the foundation and 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.750
 in addition to the powder, I still cry so let's say 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:06.599
 miniaturks of such 3 environments this shampoo is 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.599
 balm conditioner for colored hair 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:13.200
 shampoo by the way, too, for colored hair 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:15.299
 and shower gel gentle vanye but I'll start with 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.730
 shower gel because in principle about 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.920
 he had little to say he was worth 120 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.220
 rubles really smells like vanilla he 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:26.340
 very pleasant with a very pleasant smell 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:29.370
 the sensations are so soapy not 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.769
 leaves but overall i can't say 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.989
 about him something special right 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.989
 that he is some kind of super cool or there 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:39.150
 it just washes everything and can be out of it 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.430
 wash I do not know anything 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.530
 just plain good 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.170
 enough so not very thick 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.090
 consistency shower gel 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.340
 further two means 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.430
 shampoo and balsam they are very me 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.349
 liked these shampoos and balms but i 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.750
 without sls as far as I understand 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:00.030
 without any means there without my 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.239
 paraben shampoo well washes 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:06.540
 hair we have a pleasant scent but as 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:08.639
 usually for all those without sulfate 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.799
 shampoos are characteristic of what comes after them 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:13.319
 nevertheless the use of balm is required 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:16.799
 because otherwise the hair is tangled 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:20.099
 really look like straw 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.620
 Probably I don’t know how to buy 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:24.419
 I still such a shampoo but it looks like 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.349
 on all such shampoos without 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:30.960
 I liked the air conditioner very much 

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:33.360
 he is very thick he is very economical on 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.550
 my opinion was enough for me this package 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.810
 even on and even stayed a few times 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.449
 despite the fact that I have enough 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.639
 long hair I liked him 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:43.410
 principle also as likely matrix also 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:45.000
 as probably kerastase that is 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.150
 good enough such conditioner 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.479
 Mighty everything in it is what you need 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.190
 smoothes hair and 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:55.800
 unravels them that is without us 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.580
 with this shampoo basically he 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.570
 wonderful 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:02.460
 Well, in this way I can say that I 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.830
 I was happy with my shopping 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.380
 did adoboli go but if here you him 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.750
 see also miniatur fish better 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.280
 buy miniaturks first see how 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.289
 you will not like these 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.919
 means because they are well so in 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:19.020
 principle is quite expensive here you can 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:21.500
 for 120 for 130 rubles to try 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.490
 will suit you or not in principle 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.380
 decorative cosmetics I also do not 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.630
 disappointed the only thing just 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.940
 most likely leave and closer to the summer 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.159
 here on this all thank you very much for 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.020
 watching you have a nice day 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:36.560
