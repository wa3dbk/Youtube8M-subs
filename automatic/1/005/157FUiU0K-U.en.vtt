Lamont said you're unfit to stand for
the<00:03:01.300> Labour<00:03:01.480> Party<00:03:01.930> what<00:03:02.830> was<00:03:02.920> your<00:03:03.010> response

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
the Labour Party what was your response

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.910 
the Labour Party what was your response
to<00:03:03.459> that<00:03:04.020> it<00:03:05.020> was<00:03:05.140> a<00:03:05.170> little<00:03:05.290> bit<00:03:05.440> precipitate

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
to that it was a little bit precipitate

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.320 
to that it was a little bit precipitate
because<00:03:06.160> i<00:03:06.220> hadn't<00:03:06.430> convicted<00:03:06.880> at<00:03:06.970> that<00:03:07.090> point

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
because i hadn't convicted at that point

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.890 
because i hadn't convicted at that point
and<00:03:08.260> you<00:03:08.950> know<00:03:09.420> normally<00:03:10.420> one<00:03:10.630> would<00:03:10.660> expect

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
and you know normally one would expect

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.770 
and you know normally one would expect
sub<00:03:11.410> judice<00:03:11.650> e<00:03:11.800> rules<00:03:12.430> to<00:03:12.640> apply<00:03:12.730> we<00:03:13.209> employ

sub judice e rules to apply we employ
normal<00:03:14.140> employers<00:03:14.530> would<00:03:14.680> and<00:03:14.830> so<00:03:14.950> forth<00:03:15.840> but

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
normal employers would and so forth but

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.390 
normal employers would and so forth but
I<00:03:16.900> think<00:03:17.080> she<00:03:17.200> said<00:03:17.380> that<00:03:17.590> because<00:03:17.770> there<00:03:18.310> was

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
I think she said that because there was

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.190 
I think she said that because there was
a<00:03:18.430> Scottish<00:03:19.090> Labour<00:03:19.239> Party<00:03:19.570> confirm<00:03:19.930> so<00:03:20.110> it's

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
a Scottish Labour Party confirm so it's

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.930 
a Scottish Labour Party confirm so it's
quite<00:03:20.350> a<00:03:20.410> lot<00:03:20.530> of<00:03:20.650> pressure<00:03:21.250> upon<00:03:21.580> her<00:03:21.700> to<00:03:21.820> do

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
quite a lot of pressure upon her to do

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.580 
quite a lot of pressure upon her to do
that<00:03:22.090> so<00:03:23.970> she<00:03:24.970> has<00:03:25.060> a<00:03:25.090> strong<00:03:25.330> view<00:03:25.630> she<00:03:26.470> has<00:03:26.560> a

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
that so she has a strong view she has a

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.370 
that so she has a strong view she has a
political<00:03:27.070> reasons<00:03:27.340> for<00:03:27.459> saying<00:03:27.610> that<00:03:27.820> I

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
political reasons for saying that I

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.040 
political reasons for saying that I
don't<00:03:29.670> necessarily<00:03:30.670> agree<00:03:31.090> with<00:03:31.239> her<00:03:31.450> but<00:03:31.660> you

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
don't necessarily agree with her but you

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.009 
don't necessarily agree with her but you
know<00:03:32.550> some<00:03:33.550> people<00:03:33.580> will<00:03:34.420> and<00:03:34.630> some<00:03:34.780> people
