00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 moin moin and we come to bake 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.799
 effects today yes continue with how 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.519
 get like spybot 1.8 because 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:09.420
 put it together with me then 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.759
 can also use 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.780
 and if you husband linux and lupe there 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.590
 It is actually in a few steps 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.880
 done 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.590
 what do we need yes we need 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.240
 of course, infraserv linux server one 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.220
 virtual machine somewhere where the 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.650
 be or ubuntu or another 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.010
 system ongoing, the page here by 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.660
 lake gold kraftakt wie god ist einfach 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.000
 he of course links below here with me 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.500
 land right here on it and yes we 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.020
 actually need only a few below 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.600
 Points are the first to attract us of course 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.340
 with our account with us 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.780
 now all the stuff here too 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.540
 we can install with enough 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.040
 have rights and see if we java 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.719
 or any java ever 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.250
 draufhaben this we just type 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.350
 java - version so java blank 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.809
 version and as you can see I have here 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.960
 in open landscape runtime environment eistee 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.870
 2.4 point 7 on it makes the most sense 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.970
 it always times the server to update and 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.260
 to upgrade we do that with update 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.460
 then the normal packages goes through looks 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
 but somewhere finds something he 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.659
 In this case , it is possible to update four 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.250
 packages look at it and now 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.700
 update a bit around that was it too 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.670
 beautiful 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.380
 and next we'll do it 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.670
 upgrade so the update is with me now 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.229
 We are now on everyone 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.850
 case 100 percent up to date 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.560
 and now we can continue 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.420
 It would not be up yet 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.220
 has his computer or no jay kay has 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.079
 if he java the sign version 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.659
 Entering it can be very easy 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.060
 yes after installing and we find that 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.439
 here with us on the sport side and the 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.829
 command is in fact up here 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.540
 7 of course you can get away and then 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.040
 would you install it i have it 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.079
 yes now we're missing it 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.020
 but still there and we install that 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.729
 with ab - get install is very easy 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.470
 since we are asked again want 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.759
 you really install the package and 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.049
 this now lasts accordingly 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.790
 again a few seconds 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.530
 that's done now it's done 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.219
 and if you try after that too 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.360
 come 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.530
 then it will already say if the 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.210
 right version of java you have 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.159
 accordingly you can do it with yours 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.659
 test the current vision and if so 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.209
 not working just installed 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.560
 as also said that java open 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.140
 jdk 7 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.610
 tk we with everything on it what we need 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.710
 of course, we still lack the picture 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.300
 chart tool and the home us now 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.130
 first but we are going to at first 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.750
 us in the home folder wants to make sure 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.510
 us professions are with ls 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.830
 and yes we are somewhere in root 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.060
 We do not want this directory if 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.770
 Now with your normal standard 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.180
 accounts online since the page 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.070
 automatically in your home directory 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.330
 Unfortunately I have to go here again 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.030
 I'll go home directory 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.010
 with cd blank home and gives it 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.620
 Check it again and have a look here 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.030
 I have three folders and that is going on 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.530
 Of course, 300 is already something in it 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.940
 but want to have an empty directory 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.800
 otherwise the whole thing a bit 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.590
 We'll make a mess and we'll do it 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.260
 us with mk you blank now 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.700
 just spyder 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.739
 now we have it is created everything 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.980
 show how you see there it is 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:01.320
 and how do you go in with cds picot? 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.580
 now we are in there bls see you 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.120
 that is completely empty 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.100
 Now we need the image tools and 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.510
 this is linked here we can 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.769
 of course download it here now but 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.600
 that does not bring us to need it 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.580
 the root server therefore right click and 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.360
 Copy address of the left 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.790
 Let's go back to coty and enter a w 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.230
 Blank and paste that here 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.579
 so-called and he lay down now 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.200
 the internet directly into this 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:28.260
 directory in the directory like 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.970
 see this image tools points in it 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.980
 the wgt is not working you can 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.940
 easy to install with apt 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.200
 get install and then just dial though 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.390
 by default is actually on everyone 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.950
 yes debian calculator on it but who it 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.209
 not did not work can 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.299
 So download it 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.950
 so the picture will be tools and now you have to 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:51.150
 still start this point or here 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:54.180
 States can be found here under point 3 3 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.220
 and here last year was the time - java 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.110
 blank wild tools dots 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.459
 So we start the whole and if we 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.340
 now the right years vision on it 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.090
 have and the right thing to do then it works 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.530
 also go directly 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.790
 here we now have the problem as 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.380
 Here we have addressed at the beginning 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.850
 do not have the right tk on it 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.489
 it is also pointed out here 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.989
 she did not find euro here 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.370
 the right one but not found 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.959
 That's why we install it once 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.630
 again shortly after so we have now 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.579
 the latest java 7 openjdk the 460 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.360
 look at it and can do it again 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:25.560
 look like the whole thing is called version 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.630
 Now we have the latest ice t it is 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.410
 As I have just seen , I would have one 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.510
 other version 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.910
 and we can now in this folder 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.820
 again let the picture through 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.180
 picture tools point yes with java 's sign 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.410
 with blank image tools and at the end 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.580
 should we finally get our speed 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.280
 then get out folder 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:47.760
 now we are done here you see picture 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:50.370
 successful and now we have our 18th 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.229
 where we find now that as gls 1 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.979
 we see here with spam folder 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:58.700
 india with cd in the mirror folder then 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:02.669
 There would be a and here we go into the 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:04.800
 server folder and here we go 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:06.840
 Take a look and here we find it 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.020
 Complete year celebration then in the target 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:13.860
 folder so cd target and if we have it 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:16.919
 We give the sport 1 8er 01 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.630
 net schott it's so easy on linux 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:20.280
 now we can handle that at just over 180 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.690
 the jörg wind work and push around 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.210
 does that either through the console or 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.909
 you make scp overcome and then 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.020
 you can start with 1.8 and so on 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:29.130
 we say goodbye to this video shop 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.360
 I have fallen if so is yet 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.640
 I will not be rehearsing here 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.110
