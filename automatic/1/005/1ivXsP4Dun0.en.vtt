bombing<00:00:09.179> mission<00:00:09.570> I<00:00:09.719> think<00:00:13.910> that's<00:00:14.910> probably

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
bombing mission I think that's probably

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:26.269 
bombing mission I think that's probably
a<00:00:15.509> real<00:00:15.750> good<00:00:16.020> idea<00:00:24.680> he's<00:00:25.680> kind<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:25.890> spinning

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
a real good idea he's kind of spinning

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.349 
a real good idea he's kind of spinning
around<00:00:26.369> real<00:00:26.820> well

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
around real well

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:36.139 
around real well
I<00:00:33.530> like<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.680> flashing<00:00:35.190> bulb<00:00:35.430> in<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.820> head<00:00:36.000> of

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
I like the flashing bulb in the head of

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.330 
I like the flashing bulb in the head of
the<00:00:36.210> remote<00:00:36.570> oh<00:00:36.920> wait<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.950> minute<00:00:38.040> that's

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
the remote oh wait a minute that's

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.910 
the remote oh wait a minute that's
that's<00:00:38.730> infrared<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:40.110> can't<00:00:40.410> see<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.770> but

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
that's infrared so you can't see it but

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.869 
that's infrared so you can't see it but
the<00:00:41.070> camera<00:00:41.460> can<00:00:43.100> I'd<00:00:44.100> have<00:00:44.250> expected<00:00:44.700> them<00:00:44.820> to

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
the camera can I'd have expected them to

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:53.060 
the camera can I'd have expected them to
be<00:00:44.969> radio-controlled<00:00:51.440> what<00:00:52.440> do<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.559> lost<00:00:52.770> you

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
be radio-controlled what do you lost you

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.040 
be radio-controlled what do you lost you
lost<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.489> battery<00:00:53.879> but<00:00:54.149> it's<00:00:54.270> still<00:00:54.449> working
