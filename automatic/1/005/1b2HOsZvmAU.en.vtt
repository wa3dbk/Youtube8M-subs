00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:08.340
 hello in this short on the drawing 

00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:11.880
 I approach the perspective with the rendering of 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.940
 drawing using shades of the most 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.660
 bright to dark to give a 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:24.000
 three-dimensional form of depth and 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.830
 volume drawing after the portrait of 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.360
 whitney houston 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:30.710
 many of you ask me how 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.970
 to draw a French artist to 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.130
 well I would like to take advantage of 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.940
 the opportunity to show you how 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.220
 to draw my idol johnny hallyday whose 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.829
 I love these mega gig of course as 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.520
 many of his idols and I'm waiting with 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.720
 a lot of impatience his biography 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.670
 since it is published is unfortunately for 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.430
 the moment exhausted and I'm waiting with 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:58.020
 a lot of impatience well let's go back to 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:01.980
 our subject see how to achieve the 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.450
 portrait of johnny hallyday then the 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.590
 first thing to do these are 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.549
 pencil lines very thin one without 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.579
 worry about details 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.520
 you just have to highlight 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:17.549
 the different elements of the face so 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.090
 on paper so to start at 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.979
 to draw a noval so I decided to 24 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.389
 cm by 18 cm 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:30.479
 in the sense of height then divided 

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:33.270
 so on or down by a curve 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.990
 and then from right to left with a 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.719
 another curve that will be towards the 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.209
 right 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:46.529
 we will trace the shape of the front of 

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:50.729
 the tent of the ears and then trace in 

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:56.479
 the right eyebrow the side of the eye 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:02:01.619
 the cheek I propose to draw a curve 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:06.060
 for the center of the lips and now 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.500
 the left eyebrow tracing the eyes the nose 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.440
 and the mouth 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:15.360
 So here is a general pattern of 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:18.950
 portrait of awesome idea well we have 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:22.890
 outlined the main features of the portrait 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:26.220
 now let's see how to make the 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:29.600
 details I propose you to refine the 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:33.270
 facial elements so in pencil 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.940
 always to be is relatively late 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.480
 do not hesitate to take the gum and 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:43.290
 go back until the moment 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:48.390
 the drawn element corresponds to what 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:51.390
 you desire you will refined the eye the 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.580
 down his face he said so this is a 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.320
 a little bit stronger 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.560
 as soon as you feel that the expression of the 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:01.560
 face is the good 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:06.630
 you can also now refine the 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:10.709
 left then refined the sketched ear the 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:13.650
 sense of hair here you can 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:16.170
 now nuance the hair as I 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.090
 wanted to show with the purpose of 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.500
 whitney houston 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.440
 you can once you have 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.230
 used the black pencil relatively strong 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:30.600
 to skate the hair for a rendering 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:33.269
 softer nuanced present grids the 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:37.799
 face to give relief from the 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:40.799
 volume perspective insisted on the game 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:44.329
 of light on the sides of the neo the epa 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.329
 morning eyelids 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:51.110
 well now that you realized 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:54.590
 the whole picture so we go 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:57.560
 rectify areas so darker 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.690
 to give depth relief and 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.820
 clearer for things that are 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.800
 more on the surface or more that have 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:08.450
 the appearance of being larger and 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:10.550
 this using the eraser so in a 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:15.020
 first time you will blacken them 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:17.510
 areas here at the cros black pencil and well 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:21.680
 sure to clear up the other traits for 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:24.640
 give nuance with features of the 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:27.380
 dark clear shout 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:30.770
 with regard to the shaded games 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.220
 so for this palette of nuances the 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.220
 black to white 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.030
 the idea to the presence there is on 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:41.420
 to work as much as possible in the 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.910
 shades of light gray or white using 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.210
 of the eraser then to blacken to have 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.210
 depth 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:52.910
 here is the portrait of johnny hallyday is 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:55.910
 completed I am very happy to have 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:05:01.360
 realized this portrait for you of our 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:01.360
 great French idol goodbye
