okay<00:00:01.140> so<00:00:01.199> in<00:00:01.380> this<00:00:01.469> video<00:00:01.650> we're<00:00:02.010> going<00:00:02.100> to

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
okay so in this video we're going to

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.490 
okay so in this video we're going to
talk<00:00:02.340> about<00:00:02.550> a<00:00:02.669> u.s.<00:00:03.120> logics<00:00:03.689> and<00:00:03.899> their

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
talk about a u.s. logics and their

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.230 
talk about a u.s. logics and their
optimization<00:00:05.220> process<00:00:05.430> for<00:00:05.819> internet

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
optimization process for internet

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.360 
optimization process for internet
explorer<00:00:06.930> this<00:00:07.350> is<00:00:07.529> a<00:00:07.560> great<00:00:07.799> way<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:07.950> speed<00:00:08.340> up

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
explorer this is a great way to speed up

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.910 
explorer this is a great way to speed up
internet<00:00:08.790> explorer<00:00:09.630> you've<00:00:10.349> got<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.620> program

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
internet explorer you've got the program

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.160 
internet explorer you've got the program
open<00:00:11.280> come<00:00:11.490> over<00:00:11.670> here<00:00:11.820> to<00:00:11.849> optimization<00:00:12.690> and

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
open come over here to optimization and

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.300 
open come over here to optimization and
then<00:00:13.830> start<00:00:14.340> internet<00:00:15.089> optimizer<00:00:16.310> we're

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
then start internet optimizer we're

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.429 
then start internet optimizer we're
going<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.550> select<00:00:18.420> our<00:00:18.660> connection<00:00:19.080> type<00:00:19.260> in

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
going to select our connection type in

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.200 
going to select our connection type in
this<00:00:19.590> case<00:00:19.830> it<00:00:20.130> is<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:21.710> dsl<00:00:22.710> connection<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.369> i'm

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
this case it is a dsl connection and i'm

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.240 
this case it is a dsl connection and i'm
not<00:00:24.420> sure<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.750> exact<00:00:25.289> speed<00:00:25.710> this<00:00:25.949> being<00:00:26.160> a

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
not sure of the exact speed this being a

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.730 
not sure of the exact speed this being a
client<00:00:26.670> setup<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:27.240> we're<00:00:27.390> going<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.599> say<00:00:27.810> 500k

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
client setup so we're going to say 500k

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.120 
client setup so we're going to say 500k
512<00:00:29.670> kb<00:00:30.060> up<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.689> megabyte<00:00:31.349> per<00:00:31.529> second<00:00:32.009> and

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
512 kb up to a megabyte per second and

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.510 
512 kb up to a megabyte per second and
you<00:00:32.730> can<00:00:32.880> also<00:00:33.000> go<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.270> check<00:00:33.780> my<00:00:34.200> actual<00:00:34.980> can

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
you can also go to check my actual can

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.020 
you can also go to check my actual can
internet<00:00:35.940> connection<00:00:36.390> speed<00:00:37.790> you<00:00:38.790> can<00:00:38.879> go<00:00:38.969> to

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
internet connection speed you can go to

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.660 
internet connection speed you can go to
speedtest.net<00:00:39.530> and<00:00:40.530> run<00:00:40.829> one<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.129> those<00:00:41.250> tests

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
speedtest.net and run one of those tests

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.760 
speedtest.net and run one of those tests
as<00:00:41.790> well<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.809> for<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.050> sake<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.260> argument

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
as well so for the sake of argument

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.290 
as well so for the sake of argument
we're<00:00:44.250> going<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.520> say<00:00:44.730> I'm<00:00:44.969> going<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.149> close

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
we're going to say I'm going to close

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.330 
we're going to say I'm going to close
out<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.600> browser<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:46.170> we've<00:00:46.350> tested<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.980> and

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
out the browser that we've tested it and

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.819 
out the browser that we've tested it and
we<00:00:47.670> got<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.899> 512k<00:00:48.899> up<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.200> megabyte<00:00:49.620> per

we got a 512k up to a megabyte per

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.220 
we got a 512k up to a megabyte per
second<00:00:50.309> we're<00:00:50.910> going<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.120> hit<00:00:51.180> start<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.899> is

greater speed so as I said it's going to

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.899 
greater speed so as I said it's going to
run<00:01:18.659> through<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.990> do<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.729> while<00:01:20.729> we're

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
run through and do that while we're

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
RAM you have installed which is pretty

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.130 
RAM you have installed which is pretty
slick<00:01:32.549> because<00:01:32.759> that's<00:01:33.090> two<00:01:33.390> gig<00:01:33.750> right<00:01:34.079> there

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
slick because that's two gig right there

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.530 
slick because that's two gig right there
it's<00:01:35.009> basically<00:01:35.430> two<00:01:35.700> gig<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.119> installed

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
it's basically two gig of installed

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.840 
it's basically two gig of installed

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.600 
memory that the system has part of it
being<00:01:39.000> used<00:01:39.270> by<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.540> video<00:01:39.869> card<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.610> you

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
being used by the video card and you

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.090 
being used by the video card and you
have<00:01:41.759> windows<00:01:42.060> seven<00:01:42.090> running<00:01:42.540> rather<00:01:42.689> nicely

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
have windows seven running rather nicely

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.410 
have windows seven running rather nicely
and<00:01:44.100> then<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.460> tells<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.759> how<00:01:44.909> big<00:01:45.060> your<00:01:45.210> hard

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
and then it tells you how big your hard

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.999 
and then it tells you how big your hard
disk<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:46.369> and<00:01:47.369> how<00:01:47.880> much<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.740> being<00:01:49.740> used

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
disk is and how much of it is being used

through on the internet optimization it

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.190
