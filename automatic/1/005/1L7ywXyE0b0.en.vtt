00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.960 

so<00:03:58.530> once<00:03:58.740> it<00:03:58.890> out<00:03:59.010> the<00:03:59.190> second<00:03:59.520> section<00:03:59.700> you

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
so once it out the second section you

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.420 
so once it out the second section you
can<00:04:00.030> move<00:04:00.240> on<00:04:00.360> to<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.600> first<00:04:00.840> section<00:04:01.430> where

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
can move on to the first section where

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.190 
can move on to the first section where
the<00:04:02.459> corrugation<00:04:03.270> gets<00:04:03.510> simpler<00:04:03.900> for<00:04:04.140> the

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
the corrugation gets simpler for the

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.530 
the corrugation gets simpler for the
left<00:04:04.380> hand<00:04:04.620> which<00:04:04.950> is<00:04:05.010> basically<00:04:05.370> now<00:04:05.610> b<00:04:06.000> &amp;<00:04:06.030> E

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
left hand which is basically now b &amp; E

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.750 
left hand which is basically now b &amp; E
and<00:04:06.870> also<00:04:07.860> displaying<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.370> root<00:04:08.520> and<00:04:08.640> the

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
and also displaying the root and the

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.640 
and also displaying the root and the
fifth<00:04:09.030> and<00:04:09.300> I'm<00:04:09.510> this<00:04:09.840> van<00:04:10.260> thing<00:04:10.440> between

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
fifth and I'm this van thing between

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:26.900 
fifth and I'm this van thing between
that<00:04:11.010> and<00:04:12.170> so<00:04:13.170> what<00:04:13.319> it<00:04:13.440> will<00:04:13.530> sound<00:04:13.680> like<00:04:25.910> the

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
that and so what it will sound like the

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.490 
that and so what it will sound like the
right<00:04:26.940> hand<00:04:27.360> is<00:04:27.630> a<00:04:27.720> little<00:04:27.870> more<00:04:28.020> involved<00:04:28.320> at

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
right hand is a little more involved at

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.200 
right hand is a little more involved at
this<00:04:28.620> point<00:04:28.919> and<00:04:29.100> split<00:04:29.550> around<00:04:29.850> with<00:04:30.000> the<00:04:30.060> B
