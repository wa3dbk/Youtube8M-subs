00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
right worship leaders tend to have the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.580 
right worship leaders tend to have the
same<00:01:05.820> observational<00:01:06.689> perspective<00:01:07.409> as

okay silently like judging them for not

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.220 
okay silently like judging them for not
knowing<00:02:17.120> how<00:02:17.330> to<00:02:17.360> you<00:02:17.750> want<00:02:17.870> I<00:02:17.900> mean<00:02:18.050> like<00:02:18.170> I

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.300 
want to engage in them and talk to them
a<00:02:19.819> little<00:02:19.910> bit<00:02:20.060> I<00:02:20.379> think<00:02:21.379> there's<00:02:21.530> two<00:02:21.709> ways<00:02:21.739> to

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
a little bit I think there's two ways to

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.229 
a little bit I think there's two ways to
play<00:02:22.670> music

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
play music

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.949 
play music
one<00:02:24.230> is<00:02:24.379> with<00:02:24.590> your<00:02:25.160> like<00:02:25.849> analysis<00:02:26.510> like<00:02:26.930> a

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
one is with your like analysis like a

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.050 
one is with your like analysis like a
lens<00:02:27.230> right<00:02:27.739> like<00:02:27.920> you're<00:02:28.099> analyzing

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
lens right like you're analyzing

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.150 
lens right like you're analyzing
everything<00:02:29.599> here's<00:02:30.530> what<00:02:30.709> counts<00:02:31.010> you're

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
everything here's what counts you're

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.620 
everything here's what counts you're
playing<00:02:31.400> on<00:02:31.580> here's<00:02:31.790> what<00:02:31.910> count<00:02:32.150> I'm<00:02:32.360> playing

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
playing on here's what count I'm playing

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.540 
playing on here's what count I'm playing
on<00:02:32.750> when<00:02:32.870> I<00:02:32.900> playing<00:02:33.080> on<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.230> same<00:02:33.349> count<00:02:33.650> the

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
on when I playing on the same count the

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.970 
on when I playing on the same count the
e<00:02:34.580> of<00:02:34.880> three<00:02:35.150> what<00:02:35.810> right<00:02:36.019> and<00:02:36.260> then<00:02:36.769> there's

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
e of three what right and then there's

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.289 
e of three what right and then there's
this<00:02:37.130> like<00:02:37.340> antennae<00:02:37.880> of<00:02:38.739> feeling<00:02:40.209> which<00:02:41.209> is

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
this like antennae of feeling which is

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:43.240 
this like antennae of feeling which is
how<00:02:41.390> most<00:02:41.599> people<00:02:41.660> operate<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:42.620> I'll<00:02:43.040> think

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
how most people operate and I'll think

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.420 
how most people operate and I'll think
the<00:02:43.730> same<00:02:43.910> way<00:02:44.060> that<00:02:44.330> the<00:02:44.450> taste<00:02:44.660> buds<00:02:44.870> work<00:02:45.430> it

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
the same way that the taste buds work it

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.250 
the same way that the taste buds work it
tastes<00:02:46.610> good<00:02:46.849> right<00:02:47.090> everybody's<00:02:48.080> got<00:02:48.110> that

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
tastes good right everybody's got that

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.910 
tastes good right everybody's got that
antenna

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
antenna

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.539 
antenna
I<00:02:49.099> felt<00:02:49.940> I<00:02:50.120> felt<00:02:50.330> right<00:02:50.980> what<00:02:51.980> I'm<00:02:52.099> doing<00:02:52.430> right

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
I felt I felt right what I'm doing right

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.569 
I felt I felt right what I'm doing right
now<00:02:52.730> feels<00:02:53.299> right<00:02:54.040> what<00:02:55.040> you're<00:02:55.190> doing<00:02:55.489> right

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
now feels right what you're doing right

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:57.300 
now feels right what you're doing right

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
now doesn't feel right

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.400 
now doesn't feel right
okay<00:02:58.310> I<00:02:58.630> think<00:02:59.630> both<00:02:59.780> of<00:02:59.810> those<00:03:00.019> things<00:03:00.260> are

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
okay I think both of those things are

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.860 
okay I think both of those things are
helpful<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:01.579> analysis<00:03:02.060> the<00:03:02.209> analytical<00:03:02.599> lens

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
helpful the analysis the analytical lens

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.860 
helpful the analysis the analytical lens
and<00:03:03.170> the<00:03:03.620> feeling<00:03:04.099> antenna<00:03:04.610> right<00:03:05.420> just<00:03:05.630> gonna

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
and the feeling antenna right just gonna

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.500 
and the feeling antenna right just gonna
sit<00:03:06.019> in<00:03:06.079> there<00:03:06.970> both<00:03:07.970> of<00:03:08.090> those<00:03:08.180> things<00:03:08.390> are

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
sit in there both of those things are

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.660 
sit in there both of those things are
helpful<00:03:08.599> in<00:03:08.840> the<00:03:09.260> end<00:03:09.440> the<00:03:09.980> main<00:03:10.160> thing<00:03:10.400> is<00:03:10.549> the

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
helpful in the end the main thing is the

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.449 
helpful in the end the main thing is the
feeling<00:03:11.200> music<00:03:12.200> is<00:03:12.319> not<00:03:12.470> a<00:03:12.530> game<00:03:12.769> of<00:03:12.799> analysis

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
feeling music is not a game of analysis

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.240 
feeling music is not a game of analysis
it's<00:03:13.880> not<00:03:14.000> a<00:03:14.630> bunch<00:03:14.780> of<00:03:14.900> it's<00:03:15.349> just<00:03:16.040> a<00:03:16.069> math

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
it's not a bunch of it's just a math

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.460 
it's not a bunch of it's just a math
problem<00:03:16.780> right<00:03:17.780> like<00:03:17.930> I<00:03:17.989> said<00:03:18.170> before<00:03:18.260> the

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
problem right like I said before the

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.500 
problem right like I said before the
real<00:03:18.620> value<00:03:18.980> in<00:03:19.100> music<00:03:19.370> the<00:03:19.459> real<00:03:19.670> identity<00:03:20.480> of

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
real value in music the real identity of

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.660 
real value in music the real identity of
music<00:03:20.870> is<00:03:20.959> the<00:03:21.079> emotional<00:03:21.530> thing<00:03:22.430> that<00:03:22.579> it

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
music is the emotional thing that it

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.690 
music is the emotional thing that it
pulls<00:03:22.850> out<00:03:23.030> of<00:03:23.120> right<00:03:23.989> just<00:03:24.380> that<00:03:24.980> emotional

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
pulls out of right just that emotional

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.670 
pulls out of right just that emotional

to do a fill it's just gonna serve your

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.969 
to do a fill it's just gonna serve your
ineptitude<00:05:16.620> at<00:05:16.979> counting<00:05:18.410> so<00:05:19.410> if<00:05:19.590> you<00:05:19.740> could

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979 
ineptitude at counting so if you could

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:22.719 
ineptitude at counting so if you could
just<00:05:20.160> learn<00:05:20.370> how<00:05:20.580> to<00:05:20.610> count<00:05:20.940> that'd<00:05:21.330> be<00:05:21.510> better

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:22.729 
just learn how to count that'd be better

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:24.860 
just learn how to count that'd be better
right<00:05:23.729> I<00:05:23.789> mean<00:05:24.000> you<00:05:24.090> say<00:05:24.240> if<00:05:24.300> you<00:05:24.419> say<00:05:24.570> that<00:05:24.720> in
