coins<00:00:33.899> just<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.620> little<00:00:34.980> bit<00:00:35.100> cheaper<00:00:35.579> so<00:00:35.790> the

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
coins just a little bit cheaper so the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
point but it's still really really fast

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.779 
point but it's still really really fast
now<00:00:42.510> if<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.750> wanted<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:44.010> could<00:00:44.219> get<00:00:44.550> the

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
number one simply because i didn't see

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.869

like<00:00:57.899> there<00:00:58.469> was<00:00:58.620> much<00:00:58.829> point<00:00:59.250> i've<00:00:59.399> tried<00:00:59.670> the

very<00:02:27.000> very<00:02:27.329> great<00:02:27.510> player<00:02:27.719> coming<00:02:27.989> up<00:02:28.140> but

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
very very great player coming up but

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.720 
very very great player coming up but
once<00:02:28.680> put<00:02:28.920> Jack<00:02:29.040> Wilshere<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.430> he's<00:02:29.549> not

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
once put Jack Wilshere and he's not

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.030 
once put Jack Wilshere and he's not
obviously<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.180> quickest<00:02:30.569> and<00:02:30.810> it's<00:02:31.709> kind<00:02:32.010> of

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
obviously the quickest and it's kind of

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.130 
obviously the quickest and it's kind of
not<00:02:32.189> those<00:02:32.280> things<00:02:32.489> about<00:02:32.670> its<00:02:32.849> kind<00:02:33.000> of<00:02:33.030> just

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
not those things about its kind of just

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.110 
not those things about its kind of just
putting<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.409> loss<00:02:34.680> of<00:02:34.799> Pacey<00:02:35.040> plays<00:02:35.280> in<00:02:35.489> and<00:02:35.670> to

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
putting a loss of Pacey plays in and to

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.360 
putting a loss of Pacey plays in and to
get<00:02:36.269> the<00:02:36.359> chemistry<00:02:36.780> you<00:02:37.200> have<00:02:37.409> to<00:02:37.620> make<00:02:38.189> some

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
get the chemistry you have to make some

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.280 
get the chemistry you have to make some
sacrifices<00:02:38.480> somewhere<00:02:39.480> I<00:02:39.510> think<00:02:39.870> having<00:02:40.109> a

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
sacrifices somewhere I think having a

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.050 
sacrifices somewhere I think having a
solid<00:02:40.620> sentiment<00:02:41.069> instead<00:02:41.760> of<00:02:41.819> saying

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
solid sentiment instead of saying

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.970 
solid sentiment instead of saying
throwing<00:02:42.599> storage<00:02:43.200> down<00:02:43.500> there<00:02:43.769> and

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
throwing storage down there and

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.619 
throwing storage down there and
converting<00:02:44.849> doubt<00:02:45.030> everything<00:02:45.299> is<00:02:45.480> a<00:02:45.510> good

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
converting doubt everything is a good

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.770 
converting doubt everything is a good
idea<00:02:45.900> but<00:02:46.260> walk<00:02:46.470> got<00:02:46.739> incredibly<00:02:47.459> fast<00:02:47.849> 96

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
pace he's better than I thought and if I

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.580

been really really awesome team and the
gameplay<00:03:44.849> it<00:03:45.359> should<00:03:45.690> hopefully<00:03:45.840> show<00:03:46.229> that

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:46.409 
gameplay it should hopefully show that

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:48.619 
gameplay it should hopefully show that
some<00:03:46.650> goals<00:03:46.889> in<00:03:47.190> here<00:03:47.459> I'm<00:03:47.940> pretty<00:03:48.269> good<00:03:48.479> I

some goals in here I'm pretty good I
really<00:03:48.959> enjoyed<00:03:48.989> the<00:03:49.349> team<00:03:49.560> it<00:03:49.739> was<00:03:49.799> very

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
really enjoyed the team it was very

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.680 
really enjoyed the team it was very
fluid<00:03:50.489> the<00:03:50.609> passing<00:03:51.090> was<00:03:51.209> really<00:03:51.540> good

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
fluid the passing was really good

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.899 
fluid the passing was really good
because<00:03:51.810> we<00:03:52.169> had<00:03:52.379> the<00:03:53.010> three<00:03:53.310> sentiments

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:53.909 
because we had the three sentiments

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:56.569 
because we had the three sentiments
weren't<00:03:54.659> just<00:03:55.169> Pacey<00:03:55.500> like<00:03:55.859> I<00:03:56.010> didn't<00:03:56.459> get

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
weren't just Pacey like I didn't get

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.280 
weren't just Pacey like I didn't get
strikers<00:03:57.239> and<00:03:57.389> just<00:03:57.540> convert<00:03:57.900> them<00:03:58.079> down

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
strikers and just convert them down

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.379 
strikers and just convert them down
purely<00:03:58.829> for<00:03:59.069> pace<00:03:59.280> because<00:03:59.879> I<00:04:00.060> didn't<00:04:00.239> want<00:04:00.269> to

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
purely for pace because I didn't want to

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:02.420 
purely for pace because I didn't want to
do<00:04:00.479> that<00:04:00.510> I<00:04:00.629> didn't<00:04:00.810> want<00:04:00.930> to<00:04:00.989> just<00:04:01.829> have<00:04:02.129> pace

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
do that I didn't want to just have pace

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.520 
do that I didn't want to just have pace
I<00:04:02.639> want<00:04:02.819> some<00:04:03.090> decent<00:04:03.599> players<00:04:03.959> in<00:04:04.109> there<00:04:04.319> and

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
I want some decent players in there and

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.039 
I want some decent players in there and
then<00:04:05.010> three<00:04:05.159> sentiments<00:04:05.729> did<00:04:06.180> a<00:04:06.389> really<00:04:06.780> good

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
then three sentiments did a really good

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.530 
then three sentiments did a really good
job<00:04:07.109> of<00:04:07.530> holding<00:04:07.859> up<00:04:08.099> play<00:04:08.400> and<00:04:08.699> allowing<00:04:09.419> the

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
job of holding up play and allowing the

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.030 
job of holding up play and allowing the
three<00:04:09.750> attackers<00:04:10.049> it's<00:04:10.620> getting<00:04:10.829> some

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
three attackers it's getting some

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.309 
three attackers it's getting some
perfect<00:04:11.400> positions<00:04:11.759> and<00:04:11.970> then<00:04:12.389> just<00:04:12.659> have<00:04:13.290> a

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
perfect positions and then just have a

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.920 
perfect positions and then just have a
run<00:04:13.590> literally<00:04:14.220> just<00:04:14.250> absolutely<00:04:15.180> bolted

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
run literally just absolutely bolted

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.259 
run literally just absolutely bolted
down<00:04:16.079> the<00:04:16.229> wing<00:04:16.380> and<00:04:16.530> have<00:04:17.280> a<00:04:17.519> bit<00:04:17.789> of<00:04:17.820> run<00:04:18.090> this

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
down the wing and have a bit of run this

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.020 
down the wing and have a bit of run this
here<00:04:18.570> Royce<00:04:19.380> is<00:04:19.680> amazing<00:04:20.489> at<00:04:20.609> doing<00:04:20.639> little

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
here Royce is amazing at doing little

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.420 
here Royce is amazing at doing little
it's<00:04:21.180> quite<00:04:21.359> good<00:04:21.509> technique<00:04:21.810> to<00:04:21.840> fair

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
it's quite good technique to fair

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.769 
it's quite good technique to fair
unfortunately<00:04:23.430> that<00:04:23.580> didn't<00:04:23.760> go<00:04:23.880> in<00:04:24.060> but<00:04:24.270> if

00:04:24.769 --> 00:04:24.779 
unfortunately that didn't go in but if

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:27.470 
unfortunately that didn't go in but if
you<00:04:24.900> sort<00:04:25.110> of<00:04:25.229> run<00:04:25.650> across<00:04:26.310> the<00:04:26.550> pitch

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
you sort of run across the pitch

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.430 
you sort of run across the pitch
they<00:04:27.570> don't<00:04:27.810> really<00:04:27.930> know<00:04:28.140> what<00:04:28.260> to<00:04:28.350> do

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
they don't really know what to do

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.810 
they don't really know what to do
because<00:04:28.620> they<00:04:28.860> think<00:04:28.920> you<00:04:29.280> know<00:04:29.400> passing<00:04:29.610> you

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
because they think you know passing you

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.750 
because they think you know passing you
just<00:04:30.030> keep<00:04:30.150> going<00:04:30.360> it's<00:04:30.780> awesome<00:04:31.760> really

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
just keep going it's awesome really

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.850 
just keep going it's awesome really
really<00:04:33.360> awesome<00:04:33.690> I<00:04:33.990> think<00:04:34.020> voice<00:04:34.440> is<00:04:34.620> probably

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
really awesome I think voice is probably

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.680 
really awesome I think voice is probably
the<00:04:35.010> best<00:04:35.220> place<00:04:35.400> to<00:04:35.610> do<00:04:35.670> though<00:04:35.820> because<00:04:36.120> you

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
the best place to do though because you

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.420 
the best place to do though because you
can<00:04:36.870> then<00:04:37.020> quickly<00:04:37.380> cut<00:04:37.770> inside<00:04:38.070> with<00:04:38.280> some

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
can then quickly cut inside with some

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.510 
can then quickly cut inside with some
step<00:04:38.640> overs<00:04:38.970> or<00:04:39.120> a<00:04:39.210> BAM<00:04:39.780> yang<00:04:39.990> to<00:04:40.140> be<00:04:40.200> fair

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
step overs or a BAM yang to be fair

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.280 
step overs or a BAM yang to be fair
really<00:04:41.520> really<00:04:41.940> good<00:04:42.120> as<00:04:42.240> stepovers<00:04:42.780> ass<00:04:43.020> was

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
really really good as stepovers ass was

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.920 
really really good as stepovers ass was
good<00:04:43.650> the<00:04:43.800> gun<00:04:43.950> like<00:04:44.130> his<00:04:44.310> defending<00:04:44.970> and<00:04:45.150> his

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
good the gun like his defending and his

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.410 
good the gun like his defending and his
dribbling<00:04:46.500> like<00:04:46.800> they<00:04:47.760> allowed<00:04:47.940> to<00:04:48.120> get<00:04:48.240> some

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
dribbling like they allowed to get some

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.880 
dribbling like they allowed to get some
radial<00:04:48.690> position<00:04:48.840> that's<00:04:49.290> a<00:04:49.380> really<00:04:49.740> nice

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 
radial position that's a really nice

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.370 
radial position that's a really nice
goal<00:04:50.160> really<00:04:50.940> nice<00:04:51.270> outside<00:04:51.570> for<00:04:51.990> sure<00:04:52.170> I'm

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
goal really nice outside for sure I'm

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.800 
goal really nice outside for sure I'm
getting<00:04:52.800> a<00:04:52.980> 9<00:04:53.370> out<00:04:53.700> of<00:04:53.730> 10<00:04:54.030> I<00:04:54.210> think<00:04:54.510> it<00:04:54.690> could

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
getting a 9 out of 10 I think it could

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.000 
getting a 9 out of 10 I think it could
be<00:04:54.930> better<00:04:55.080> if<00:04:55.230> you<00:04:55.350> upgrade<00:04:55.680> some<00:04:55.860> of<00:04:55.950> the

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
be better if you upgrade some of the

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.130 
be better if you upgrade some of the
players<00:04:56.160> would<00:04:56.400> say<00:04:56.550> upgrades<00:04:57.020> but<00:04:58.020> you

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.140 
players would say upgrades but you

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.450 
players would say upgrades but you
probably<00:04:58.320> don't<00:04:58.440> need<00:04:58.770> it<00:04:58.980> like<00:04:59.130> it<00:04:59.250> was<00:04:59.280> just

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
probably don't need it like it was just

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.910 
probably don't need it like it was just
a<00:04:59.580> really<00:04:59.880> fun<00:05:00.090> scene<00:05:00.630> but<00:05:00.930> I'm<00:05:01.410> not<00:05:01.710> actually

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 
a really fun scene but I'm not actually

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.710 
a really fun scene but I'm not actually
that<00:05:02.280> good<00:05:02.340> at<00:05:02.700> pace<00:05:02.940> if<00:05:03.150> you<00:05:03.240> think<00:05:03.450> I<00:05:03.510> still

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
that good at pace if you think I still

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.260 
that good at pace if you think I still
had<00:05:03.810> to<00:05:03.990> rely<00:05:04.770> on<00:05:04.800> my<00:05:05.040> dribbling<00:05:05.340> and<00:05:05.790> sort<00:05:06.210> of
