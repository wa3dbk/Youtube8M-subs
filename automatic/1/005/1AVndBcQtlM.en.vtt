00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.750
 hello how am I, Jesus, gallant 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:09.379
 online mondo rhythmic and today we are going to 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:12.820
 work the polyrhythm of 3 over 4 4 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:17.420
 over 3 to control this pole and pace 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:20.960
 it is necessary to control the language before 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:24.650
 of sixteenths if we take a 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:29.179
 4x4 the total of sixteenths that are not 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:33.570
 center in a 4x4 are 16 if we take a 3 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:36.090
 by 4 the total of sixteenths are 12 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.670
 in this case we should control 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.100
 both the sixteenths arena in 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.390
 the 4x4 as the field of the sixteenths 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.320
 in the 3 x 4 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.710
 that is to say 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.440
 each of the 16 sixteenths or of the 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:55.730
 12 sixteenths that are in a compass 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.800
 of 4 x 4 or in a 3 x 4 measure 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.570
 here we have a compass of three 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:04.390
 four as we have written three times 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:08.390
 four 12 and 33 blacks and sixteenths 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:13.190
 corresponding to 3 by 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:15.740
 3 4 1 2 3 4 if this is clear to us 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.640
 that there are these 12 sixteenths now 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:22.630
 let's choose certain semicorcheas d 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:25.150
 of the compass to get a 4x4 on top 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.060
 of this three by four if we 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.880
 we have catch we are dividing those 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:37.360
 four sixteenths of each time in 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:40.600
 groups of 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.530
 we see that four groups come out 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.320
 of three sixteenths 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.729
 each group wish of those three 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.220
 Sixteenths becomes a black 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.970
 new 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:55.070
 we are here every accent in a black 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.840
 here we have in the first black the 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.540
 second black the third black and the 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.780
 fourth quarter 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.780
 in this case those four blacks 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.560
 It makes us a musical phrase 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.929
 within three by four in one of 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.940
 four times four if we count one two 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.840
 three four and it is we have a three by 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.240
 four which is what we simply do 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.270
 multiply by four each of the 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.650
 black of the compass different to four times 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.360
 four in this case is three by four 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:30.260
 with which 444 and in turn we divide 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:35.140
 those four in three 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:38.049
 then we take 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 123 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:42.319
 then every beginning I count again 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:46.129
 each principle of those 3 notes is 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:50.060
 turns into a new black 2 3 4 1 2 3 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:53.299
 4 here we have 4 semicorcheas be forgiveness 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:56.690
 4 blacks that have come out of a 3 by 4 is 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:03:01.010
 easy then with if we take 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:04.489
 the 3 blacks of the 3 by 4 and we add the 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.650
 4 blacks 1 2 3 4 it becomes a 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:09.630
 musical phrase that is within the 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.930
 language the semiquaver language 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.790
 we have in this case 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:19.000
 the first and last of a group of 4 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.829
 two eighth notes and then we have the 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.230
 first and second of a group of 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:26.019
 four that are sixteenths and eighth note 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.370
 Dotted now understand why 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:33.549
 you have to control the language of the 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:37.120
 sixteenths in the bass drum pum 23.23 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:41.170
 and singing for catsup is this is tap 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.430
 tap is ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:48.090
 TA Ta ta 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:52.880
 to work these types of exercises 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:56.120
 It is essential to have a good metronome 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.040
 a metronome to help us especially in 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.970
 the first steps to listen to these 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.410
 policies 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.410
 and I recommend you 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.120
 to look at this this metronome this 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.670
 metronome is 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.190
 for any musician or a real 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:18.570
 passed metronome the relationships that 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:23.400
 We between measures may vary can 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:27.960
 add 5 7 9 11 irregular bars 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:30.449
 let's say 15 17 good things that better not 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:34.550
 we touch in our life but this 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:36.350
 Metronome some brainiac it has 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.529
 he has thought it will surely be a 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:41.349
 battery as we are all crazy 

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:43.519
 and the truth is that it is a tool 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:45.229
 very important or you can take a 

00:04:43.519 --> 00:04:47.209
 sheet music editing program and 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.999
 write us your polyrhythms and 

00:04:47.209 --> 00:04:53.650
 others in the sibelius for example 

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:57.160
 end each one the most comfortable 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:59.979
 now let's hear a little how 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:03.470
 it may sound a 3 over 4 and a 4 over 3 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:05.330
 in a specific situation 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.490
 well we are already on the battery and now 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.320
 let's play the musical phrase that we have 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.480
 created about three by four in the 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.520
 box once touched in the box 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.070
 we will separate the hands and we will see that 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.820
 converts to a policy of 4 out of 3 3 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.820
 about 4 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:35.099
 123 sub 23 is adapted for potato 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:47.650
 nothing is adapted to each one 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:53.840
 23.2 3.23 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 for 1 2 3 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:06:07.979
 4 1 2 3 for a separate hands 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:06:11.310
 12 31 23 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 and 1 2 3 and 1 2 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:14.340
 3 4 1 2 3 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:17.400
 and we get with the same brand of 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:21.890
 metronome play 2 different measures 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:24.890
 the time of 4 and that of 3 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.890
 ah 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:39.850
 the power to control this polygamy we 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:42.580
 sharpens the sense of hearing we know that 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:45.889
 we are playing a compass 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.960
 interact with the other interested 

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:50.960
 this 15 d 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.819
 of interaction creating sensations 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.759
 different to always be playing the 

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:58.009
 compass that he proposes to us in the song 

00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:59.990
 we can interact is how I 

00:06:58.009 --> 00:07:02.120
 I consider as a modal interchange in 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:05.960
 harmony this is a rhythmic exchange 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:08.680
 you're playing in 4 3 3 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.680
 4 

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:15.520
 let's say the most practical end the power 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:18.060
 exchange only when you can 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.060
 some drinks 

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:24.010
 Well, so far today's class 

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:27.380
 I hope it was interesting 

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:31.150
 remember that we see you online mondo 

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:31.150
 rhythmic greeting
