00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.630
 hello how about friends welcome to zone 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.510
 ghost I am phantom and I bring you 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.460
 information about targets 2 zombies what 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.800
 that we were waiting for many are 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.830
 asking enough questions about what 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.110
 will happen what will happen in black zombies 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.910
 ops 2 but well this here I'm going to 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.940
 bring some answers like 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:41.530
 remember in the trailer this image comes out 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:43.180
 where it seems that it is the light of the box 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.610
 mysterious they remember the box where 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.190
 we could grab weapons that came out 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.070
 randomly, because I'm made to 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:54.130
 if it is the box if it is the light that goes 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.930
 towards that box even if only 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.480
 put here just to give us a 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.850
 taste of what it is and is coming 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.340
 zombies although they still did not take us out 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.399
 nothing concrete in this trailer also 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:09.579
 for those who order in the game top 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:12.130
 order in the white game 2 and they 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:14.229
 they are delivering a poster this well is 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.210
 can see from both sides and good from a 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.399
 side has the face this with the man 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.180
 with the gun and the other side has to 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:22.570
 is 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.640
 what is the mysterious woman for many 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.100
 who will be who it will be because I have a 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.570
 theory seems to me that is samantha 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:33.640
 take it off enough will say no it can not be 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.990
 but if there are many possibilities that 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:41.670
 be that blanket and more grown up be here 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:44.500
 as you can see it has some melon shopper 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.930
 some girls that did not put him but this one 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.500
 what I wanted to say is kg how can 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:53.470
 see has a shotgun this shotgun 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.930
 apparently it's winchester's 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:00.009
 winchester that looks like it's going to come out in 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:03.700
 the zombie game in black ops and I 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.950
 it seems to me that it is quite 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.530
 interesting that you can use it already 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.840
 they know the story at the end but if you 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.290
 they fix well here on the in the poster and 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.989
 here is the teddy bear appears on 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.710
 teddy bear and near his foot his 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.290
 left foot 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:24.260
 and this is another sign that this has 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.200
 what to do with zombies and also that this 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:31.190
 skull that was already stopping is of 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:34.280
 doping that it is quite possible that 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.680
 be the final rector if you look closely at the 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.300
 way you have hair this there 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.460
 some images that you can find 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.250
 when they do not have the beanie is the 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.320
 right faith then it's pretty much like 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.020
 I think it will be remembered 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.830
 he and samantha changed body 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:54.670
 then it is likely quite probable 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:59.510
 that in the history of what is the 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:02.210
 black ops 2 give us more information 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.160
 of what happened or what it is that 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.890
 follow after what we saw 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.680
 in what is the world map then 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.170
 we have to wait let's see what else 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.690
 more brings and good other zombie data 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:18.470
 of black ops 2 is that you will be able to 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.420
 play in up to 8 players then 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.270
 I hope they are not going to do something 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.290
 seemed like what they did in the 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.710
 game receives no operation 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.140
 reconsider and I could 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:31.290
 four players against four players 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.720
 and it's a kind of team duel and 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.640
 zombies coming out everywhere I hope 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.100
 do not do that because I feel that what 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.680
 they would ruin if they say they do 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.440
 cooperative but they are not going to do that 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.880
 because it would be a big disappointment so 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.250
 least of my part I do not know what they think 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:53.220
 you and also that this is him 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:55.770
 in this game they are going to have missions 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.380
 will have the regular thing that is the rounds 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.210
 to go from round to round to see 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.580
 which is the highest you can get and 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:04.920
 they keep coming out the zombies are going to 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.660
 have that the classic and also other 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.200
 different game modes that are going to 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.640
 add that you still do not know yet with 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.490
 accuracy of what is going to be treated but 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.680
 is a little bit of change does not fall badly and 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:20.070
 you know that all the novices we 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.860
 then we used to see what else we 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.080
 also brings that the graphic engine that 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.120
 they will use for zombies is going to be the 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.580
 same that they will use for multiplayer 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.110
 then this gives them a little bit more 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.590
 freedom to them to 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:38.830
 doing things are a little more entertaining 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.510
 at the time that we play good 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.460
 that 's what I have so far about 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.650
 zombies I hope you liked it already 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.510
 you know the favorite X leave your 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:50.260
 comments that they think they expect from 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:52.330
 blacos zombies in 2 and good too 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.280
