00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.030
 I participated in November marathon 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.790
 new york and i'm having a little side 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.520
 advice from the fir trees with the course 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.750
 is not very easy and then I 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.460
 would like us to talk a little bit about 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.450
 the general atmosphere of the race that 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.160
 it's really a magical race 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.110
 since it's gone for all 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.130
 runners of the dream on which it is necessary 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.560
 go at least once in his life 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.489
 how did you feel it oasis 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.550
 actually an important event 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.500
 it's one of the biggest promo marathon 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.920
 Marathon internal world 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.949
 participations the mood here the aspect 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.300
 mythical 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:49.890
 I enjoyed the experience 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:52.890
 what is strange that reserves me and that 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.809
 was a very positive experience 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.989
 we waited to see differently the 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.579
 desecration what interested me growing up 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.990
 everything in the midst of the profession 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.360
 point that mom 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.010
 therefore because it was his 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.200
 first marathon can choose werlen 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.570
 take some easy and why the 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.460
 from new york for example with hindsight 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.380
 it is true that I would have made the expenses 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.570
 the new york joy and that's the pride 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.980
 judge from this time I do not 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.080
 am not prepared accordingly by 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:22.860
 report at the beginning it's true that for a 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.110
 first marathon I had two french 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.970
 work if I had been to berlin where 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.860
 the fastest marathon I think 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.090
 I had between two indeed 2h11 in 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.980
 the legs for the first with a 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.030
 preparation success as this week 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:38.070
 but what hurt me the most 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.420
 quotation marks that of the path that is 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.280
 I did not think it was so hard 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.110
 for sure I was not prepared for 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.390
 consequence it was prepared in the 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.049
 Lyonnais suburbs on courses a 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:52.200
 little flat not too low the union 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:53.909
 it was very complicated to manage 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.009
 it is the discovery of the test I had 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.590
 already the American markets I thought 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.409
 not done so early in the race 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.530
 but just 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.939
 does it disgust you or not 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.390
 it was an experience that you will 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.049
 return 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.750
 huawei in a bike experience the map 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:14.220
 empowered because more is needed for 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:18.090
 we disgust but announced the 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.620
 telecommuting is very informative I 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.090
 learned a lot about myself because 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.400
 the marathon is really a test 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.310
 which requires a lot of 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.349
 self-knowledge of a preparation 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.930
 and then as sweet as their output 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.849
 it's just two marathons if I pass 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.430
 well tailgating us their feelings 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:38.819
 who leave in covered mud and well 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:42.000
 you laugh to calculate my mobility 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.349
 god to hang on in the hard you 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.840
 control nothing until the finish 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:48.100
 so now it was me I saw your 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.140
 race on TV but 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.670
 the American directors showed that 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.990
 the first ones and I believe that at a moment 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.330
 given you were training you led 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:03:00.600
 exciting market seaway wanted 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:04.240
 really that is to say that it will give 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:08.650
 I'm sorry for a state of mind like everything 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:10.420
 do the game during for twenty five 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.870
 kilometers I walked shots it was 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.280
 not hard fight was hard but heart 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.810
 mans guys who tell you about me 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.980
 heard him breathe then I was 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.700
 well because their economy 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:24.160
 I was on the basis of contention but 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:30.520
 I was new to me so I was 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:33.400
 hurts it's sixth place was at 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.290
 tidy up the question is what I stop 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.090
 I'm going to tell you what made me the most 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.790
 bad it's not that I spend on 30th I'm 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:43.240
 say i 'll do in the ten though 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.770
 saw i'm going to do my eco office 36th 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.190
 as well as the mayor in absolute it's 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.070
 not a lot 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.470
 nancy kilometers it rocks at all at 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.390
 everything and there you go from a state and forests 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.080
 that a state or if the sad that makes 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.090
 account they ask what's all going 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.380
 because we must be punished because 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.940
 left driving accordingly it is 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:05.590
 that you are worthy even in difficulty 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:07.540
 but no we see really good and the 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.370
 origins of like that tandja is not 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.700
 comparable on jmm on a shy 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:16.989
 even in the very pale never ever 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:18.700
 after I know what I missed so no 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.820
 no it's a great experience 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.680
 we travel itself the credit 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.580
 atmosphere is about what you 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.860
 long time were so focused 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.720
 like a panting at nothing when rendered 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.790
 all you can not talk about the fervor of the 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.390
 public the methods ya of the world or not 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.490
 you are so you saw 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.990
 yeah you're in your bubble and especially 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:42.530
 after you are focused on his run share 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:44.450
 of market rabbit vp at the beginning all the 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.460
 world have no vendors but who want 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.600
 from in front to put mallet who 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.940
 mounts if you magnify and 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.420
 the witness rally I know that kiprotich 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:57.040
 is very tired several tables for 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.240
 I was with net weight we never 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.180
 a table with three guys and the good guys 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.640
 kiprotich title team and champion 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.940
 Olympic in Uganda took my the 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:09.340
 bottle what they suspected the 15th 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.390
 and it's important to 15 m I know everything 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.640
 but no doubt and on May 15 at 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:15.310
 Twentieth candle dutronc of the goal off 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.840
 helpers leave the official drink but 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.940
 as I am prepared with same drink 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:22.840
 for two months I vomited 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:24.730
 so that's a management that you 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.060
 discover on the moment tea during your 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:30.010
 prepare to drink a drink I 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:32.470
 was trying to be your death not 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:36.940
 were acid amass 6g bonus and 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:38.440
 so this is a management no place on 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.910
 course is perfect 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.160
 the question is what are you 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.630
 will return to the day to force the case not 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.050
 of date still the weight of the pizza 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.050
 Fourneret
