z1 is doesn't have this kind of edge to
a<00:00:41.100> cool<00:00:41.399> edge-to-edge<00:00:41.640> display<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.600> this

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
a cool edge-to-edge display that this

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.529 
a cool edge-to-edge display that this
kind<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.050> concept<00:00:43.260> has<00:00:43.969> so<00:00:44.969> this<00:00:45.149> console<00:00:45.450> is

pretty cool because that's ultra-thin
vessels<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.570> then<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.320> seems<00:00:49.469> like<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:49.829> slim

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
too much space then also seems that it

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.380

16 16 ship will be bigger than the

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.780 
16 16 ship will be bigger than the
galaxy<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.740> three<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.100> going<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.310> come<00:01:29.490> out<00:01:29.520> in

galaxy of three is going to come out in

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.870 
galaxy of three is going to come out in
a<00:01:29.850> market<00:01:30.090> right<00:01:30.210> now<00:01:30.680> resolution<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.770> 3840<00:01:32.400> x

2160<00:01:33.869> almost<00:01:34.770> like<00:01:34.979> 4k<00:01:35.520> resolution<00:01:36.030> i<00:01:36.090> think

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
2160 almost like 4k resolution i think

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.660 
2160 almost like 4k resolution i think
and<00:01:37.170> into<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.560> song<00:01:37.920> three<00:01:38.340> gigahertz

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
and into a song three gigahertz

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.560 
and into a song three gigahertz
quad-core<00:01:39.170> processor<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:40.439> like<00:01:41.189> Intel<00:01:41.640> AMD

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
quad-core processor so like Intel AMD

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.899 
quad-core processor so like Intel AMD
processors<00:01:43.380> it's<00:01:43.890> kind<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.310> like<00:01:44.460> getting

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
processors it's kind of like getting

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.889 
processors it's kind of like getting
like<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.210> real<00:01:45.890> computer<00:01:47.420> it's<00:01:48.420> pretty<00:01:48.630> same

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
like a real computer it's pretty same

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.190 
like a real computer it's pretty same
four<00:01:49.259> gigabytes<00:01:49.590> ram<00:01:49.920> like<00:01:50.250> computers<00:01:50.790> have

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
four gigabytes ram like computers have

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.440 
four gigabytes ram like computers have
and<00:01:52.200> then<00:01:52.380> 128<00:01:53.280> gigabytes<00:01:53.759> all<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.149> storage

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
the top side which i think i was must be

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.960 
the top side which i think i was must be
the<00:02:59.540> best<00:02:59.750> place<00:03:00.410> to<00:03:00.680> put<00:03:00.829> the<00:03:00.980> speaker<00:03:01.400> as<00:03:01.549> the

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
the best place to put the speaker as the

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.970 
the best place to put the speaker as the
iphone<00:03:02.390> has<00:03:02.630> yeah<00:03:03.110> I<00:03:03.140> furness<00:03:03.440> the<00:03:03.560> speakers

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
all on the bottom and I think that might

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.530 
all on the bottom and I think that might
be<00:03:06.410> one<00:03:06.680> of<00:03:06.709> the<00:03:06.829> best<00:03:07.010> places<00:03:07.329> but<00:03:08.329> one<00:03:08.420> of

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
be one of the best places but one of

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.440 
be one of the best places but one of
these<00:03:08.660> thing<00:03:08.989> is<00:03:09.170> that<00:03:09.730> this<00:03:10.730> sony<00:03:11.030> phone<00:03:11.239> has

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
these thing is that this sony phone has

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.199 
these thing is that this sony phone has
a<00:03:11.480> lot<00:03:11.690> of<00:03:11.720> place<00:03:12.680> on<00:03:13.310> the<00:03:13.700> bottom<00:03:14.000> on<00:03:14.090> the

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
a lot of place on the bottom on the

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.150 
a lot of place on the bottom on the
front<00:03:14.420> side<00:03:14.600> of<00:03:14.660> the<00:03:14.900> phone<00:03:15.079> and<00:03:15.380> also<00:03:16.040> they

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
front side of the phone and also they

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.160 
front side of the phone and also they
talk<00:03:16.459> when<00:03:17.090> it<00:03:17.239> probably<00:03:17.600> would<00:03:17.780> be<00:03:17.810> able<00:03:17.989> to

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
talk when it probably would be able to

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.590 
talk when it probably would be able to
put<00:03:18.350> this<00:03:18.470> speaker<00:03:19.090> so<00:03:20.090> that<00:03:20.299> would<00:03:20.420> probably

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
put this speaker so that would probably

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.539 
put this speaker so that would probably
a<00:03:20.840> better<00:03:20.989> place<00:03:21.260> but<00:03:21.410> it<00:03:21.530> looks<00:03:21.680> so<00:03:21.859> sexy<00:03:22.069> when

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
a better place but it looks so sexy when

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.340 
a better place but it looks so sexy when

say<00:03:27.560> i<00:03:27.950> don't<00:03:28.280> think<00:03:28.489> glass<00:03:28.760> back<00:03:29.060> is<00:03:29.329> the<00:03:29.569> best

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.440 
say i don't think glass back is the best
material<00:03:30.829> even<00:03:31.639> though<00:03:31.760> it<00:03:31.790> looks<00:03:32.150> a<00:03:32.329> little

bit<00:03:32.630> sexy<00:03:33.109> but<00:03:33.380> it<00:03:33.799> kind<00:03:33.980> of<00:03:34.040> makes<00:03:34.160> your<00:03:34.340> phone

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:34.609 
bit sexy but it kind of makes your phone
