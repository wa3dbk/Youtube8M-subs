motion and you can see how beautiful the
design<00:02:22.910> is<00:02:23.209> and<00:02:23.510> it<00:02:23.600> just<00:02:23.630> pops<00:02:24.049> right<00:02:24.230> off<00:02:24.380> the

powders so let's look at a couple other

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:41.160 
powders so let's look at a couple other
of<00:02:37.820> the<00:02:37.970> cards<00:02:38.239> that<00:02:38.329> I<00:02:38.540> created

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.100 

this<00:02:41.800> one<00:02:42.069> here

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.860 

using<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.290> new<00:02:46.470> tags<00:02:46.890> and<00:02:47.370> I<00:02:48.180> cut<00:02:48.390> out<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.660> tag

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
just saw me use and then I cut out the

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.670 
just saw me use and then I cut out the
tag<00:02:53.300> also<00:02:54.300> on<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.720> tags<00:02:54.989> are<00:02:55.290> these<00:02:55.530> little

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
butterfly and I just made it so it looks

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.110

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
I took the eleganza web ribbon here and

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.400 
I took the eleganza web ribbon here and
I<00:03:08.370> cut<00:03:08.640> it<00:03:08.730> in<00:03:08.849> half<00:03:08.879> and<00:03:09.510> then<00:03:09.720> I<00:03:09.870> used<00:03:10.170> a

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
I cut it in half and then I used a

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.229 
I cut it in half and then I used a
little<00:03:10.709> bit<00:03:10.830> of<00:03:10.860> the<00:03:11.190> 3d<00:03:11.549> stamp<00:03:11.819> paint<00:03:12.090> right

little bit of the 3d stamp paint right

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.650 
little bit of the 3d stamp paint right
on<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.540> edges<00:03:12.930> here<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.530> complete<00:03:13.890> my<00:03:14.099> card

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
on the edges here to complete my card

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.020 
on the edges here to complete my card
the<00:03:15.660> background<00:03:16.349> here<00:03:16.769> and<00:03:16.950> my<00:03:17.250> lacking<00:03:17.730> loops

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
the background here and my lacking loops

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.569 
the background here and my lacking loops
is<00:03:18.209> in<00:03:18.569> a<00:03:18.840> previous<00:03:19.140> video<00:03:19.590> that<00:03:19.829> I<00:03:20.130> have<00:03:20.370> done

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
is in a previous video that I have done

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.150 
is in a previous video that I have done
and<00:03:20.910> it's<00:03:21.390> basically<00:03:21.660> just<00:03:22.019> using<00:03:22.620> two<00:03:22.920> colors

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
and it's basically just using two colors

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.210 
and it's basically just using two colors
of<00:03:23.579> the<00:03:23.880> 3d<00:03:24.269> stamp<00:03:24.599> paint<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.140> then<00:03:25.650> stamping

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
of the 3d stamp paint and then stamping

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.460 
of the 3d stamp paint and then stamping
on<00:03:26.370> top<00:03:26.670> with<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.120> black<00:03:27.420> with<00:03:27.900> that<00:03:28.110> design

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
on top with the black with that design

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.520 
on top with the black with that design
as<00:03:28.769> the<00:03:28.829> black<00:03:29.819> resists<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:30.569> stamp<00:03:30.959> paint<00:03:31.230> it

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
as the black resists the stamp paint it

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.310 
as the black resists the stamp paint it
gives<00:03:31.829> you<00:03:31.950> a<00:03:31.980> really<00:03:32.220> beautiful<00:03:32.610> effect

this card is again using the same
background<00:03:39.920> technique<00:03:40.340> and<00:03:40.550> you<00:03:40.610> can<00:03:40.760> see

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
background technique and you can see

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.880 
background technique and you can see
this<00:03:41.090> on<00:03:41.300> black<00:03:41.570> and<00:03:41.810> the<00:03:41.900> Sun<00:03:42.080> white<00:03:42.290> so<00:03:42.620> even

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
this on black and the Sun white so even

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.320 
this on black and the Sun white so even
though<00:03:42.920> I've<00:03:43.100> used<00:03:43.310> the<00:03:43.430> same<00:03:43.610> colors<00:03:44.030> you<00:03:44.210> get

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.560 
though I've used the same colors you get
a<00:03:44.390> totally<00:03:44.930> different<00:03:45.530> look<00:03:46.310> and<00:03:46.580> this<00:03:47.330> time

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
a totally different look and this time

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.500 
a totally different look and this time
again<00:03:47.930> I've<00:03:48.170> used<00:03:48.500> the<00:03:48.680> black<00:03:49.060> that<00:03:50.060> we<00:03:50.270> just

the locking loops I actually use the

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.660 
the locking loops I actually use the
e6000<00:04:53.330> spray<00:04:53.600> adhesive<00:04:53.750> just<00:04:54.410> because<00:04:54.830> it's<00:04:55.520> a
