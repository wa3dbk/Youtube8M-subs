00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:51.339 
she locks the phone in place there's two

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:54.059 
she locks the phone in place there's two
ways<00:00:51.549> of<00:00:51.850> fitting<00:00:52.629> the<00:00:52.749> phone<00:00:52.959> in<00:00:53.199> you<00:00:53.859> can

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:54.069 
ways of fitting the phone in you can

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:57.660 
ways of fitting the phone in you can
slip<00:00:54.609> it<00:00:54.789> in<00:00:54.909> as<00:00:55.209> so<00:00:55.600> and<00:00:56.379> it<00:00:56.559> locks<00:00:57.219> like<00:00:57.399> that

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
slip it in as so and it locks like that

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.059 
slip it in as so and it locks like that
and<00:00:57.850> the<00:00:57.940> screen<00:00:58.299> is<00:00:58.329> is<00:00:59.139> obviously<00:00:59.469> pointed

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:00.069 
and the screen is is obviously pointed

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:02.459 
and the screen is is obviously pointed
outward<00:01:00.489> so<00:01:00.760> solar<00:01:01.209> can<00:01:01.749> still<00:01:01.959> get<00:01:02.109> damaged

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
outward so solar can still get damaged

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.560 
outward so solar can still get damaged
and<00:01:02.559> so<00:01:02.739> on<00:01:02.889> this<00:01:03.459> is<00:01:03.609> the<00:01:03.729> part<00:01:03.909> that<00:01:04.030> locks<00:01:04.390> it

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
and so on this is the part that locks it

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.520 
and so on this is the part that locks it
on<00:01:05.040> on<00:01:06.040> problem<00:01:06.520> it's<00:01:06.730> my<00:01:06.880> fault<00:01:07.120> we<00:01:07.900> just
