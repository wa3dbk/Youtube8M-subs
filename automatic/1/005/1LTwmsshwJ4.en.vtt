00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:06.150
 how about health friends on this occasion 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.339
 I bring you the review of apparently 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:14.250
 two different cases but rather it's the 

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:16.230
 same is a 64 view of riviera good them 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.300
 I say that I bring all because good 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.640
 I wanted to show you a difference 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.070
 that lies between the tweets 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.560
 some little things like for example in this 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:31.380
 case some that are common like this 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:34.470
 are worth less than 10 90 but that cost me 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.350
 this and well it is a common car and 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.059
 current but inside the cars 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.550
 ordinary is that they come from hot 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.070
 wheels also comes in cars what 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.930
 they call rubber tires or super 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.030
 so you call these cars that 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.200
 they differ good first the packaging as 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.690
 you can see although it is the same 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.800
 This car shows that here 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.780
 drawings that this one is not in the packaging 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.700
 out of that it appears in this case in the 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.160
 special case of this after nothing else 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.890
 is the difference but also in the 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.460
 back would be noticed and here we go to 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.460
 see them up 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.590
 sometimes it can be there you can see the 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.750
 equal difference in the trunk and then 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.690
 something that is even more notorious is the 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.580
 fact that it is 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.420
 divert the tires here have the 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.010
 rims and see the rims of this as 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.650
 you can see seemingly 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.160
 they are smaller but in this case 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.670
 these are rubber tires we are going to 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:39.560
 open it 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.560
 so we can appreciate the 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:48.790
 the good figure this is what they call 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:51.210
 some of those who collect 11 you loved 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.070
 leave wells this is what they call a 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.070
 super 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.470
 or a car with rubber tires something 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.630
 that can mainly lay the 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.300
 what we will mainly notice is 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.540
 that the wheels are different 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.060
 here is me I am this I bought it in 1090 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.510
 I was hanging and I grabbed a chedraui 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.700
 is already 10 90 however these are 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.740
 they are selling much more expensive the 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.020
 they sell on the internet and that's why 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.790
 fought but it is if you can see 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.370
 that the difference is the tires of 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.460
 rubber a cart or any other cart 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.050
 normal for example 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.050
 and let's go see the difference between 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.240
 the tires 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.770
 and the rubber tires do not like that 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.520
 also the wheels are usually 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:39.630
 different are like me 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.630
 like the other he 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.290
 because I have that is this and you can see 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.769
 you guys like the tires are different 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.420
 the wheels are different if in this case 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.239
 the colors differ a lot from the 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.750
 normal version so the cart looks 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.240
 totally the same 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.700
 and good and only those who buy them 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.860
 and they keep them in their packages because 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.810
 if they like it because that's how they think 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.240
 right to me no god took it out of the 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.280
 package and I enjoy another difference 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.100
 is that these are called astur 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.250
 hands but if you see a version 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.050
 normal like this is not a disorder is 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.910
 a normal version but if it comes with 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.490
 rubber tires complete a stroke with 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.900
 where we noticed it here we see it I'm going to 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.520
 make an approach for the camera 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.720
 can be with a cart is distorted 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.900
 this 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.370
 and see it in th have surjan be the 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.830
 hidden treasures of a treasure 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.630
 hidden so that it apparently comes 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.460
 like any other common cart and 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.950
 current as meaning within all the 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.960
 line and that if one does not know how to distinguish 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.760
 then the account but out of what 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.910
 is the rubber tires the cart is the 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.890
 same and it comes out in a heap 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.780
 some some others are also 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.270
 called back emerge as for example 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:56.170
 this as life I already commented before 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:58.540
 that's because here this giving allows 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.750
 and you see here I can see it is already 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.459
 half in 2013 in this one I'm already going 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.100
 to turn it to know better this side 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.720
 is in this flame indicates that it is a 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.590
 phone even if the tire is of 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.670
 normal plastic and in some cases it is 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.350
 that back there 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.109
 well as this one they have half and 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:20.709
 apart it comes with the rubber tire that 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.850
 they are already different let's say that in 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.420
 that sense but they are also 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.130
 considered super 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.320
 and well then there is this is 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.350
 practically the same cart no longer 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.270
 have for me case to get this and good 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.100
 I'm just showing you so they can see the 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.630
 difference and that if you any 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.210
 occasion have the opportunity to leave 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:41.000
 he got them and they appreciate it not for the 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:44.000
 value of what some may ask in 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.190
 internet but simply for the value 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.860
 to have a car that is really worth it 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:52.670
 Well, this was my review of the 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.700
 super 64 live and also applies for 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.990
 see the normal because I showed them 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.420
 so I hope you liked it 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.390
 our review and then we are in 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:05.300
 contact and any other questions or 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:07.280
 any other appreciation then forward 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.720
 can do it I think it will taste 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.760
 revisions and we are pending for 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.300
 other revisions that are well greetings 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.300
 bye
