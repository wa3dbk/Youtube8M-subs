images before inserting them into
articles<00:00:23.599> this<00:00:24.599> produces<00:00:25.140> two<00:00:25.349> problems

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
articles this produces two problems

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.609 
articles this produces two problems
first<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.480> physical<00:00:27.840> size<00:00:28.200> of<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.470> image

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
first the physical size of the image

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.220 
first the physical size of the image
might<00:00:29.160> be<00:00:29.340> too<00:00:29.520> large<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.149> not<00:00:30.779> display<00:00:31.140> on

the page as you'd like this is easily
overcome<00:00:34.469> though<00:00:34.710> by<00:00:35.280> selecting<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.180> image

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
overcome though by selecting the image

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.369 
overcome though by selecting the image
and<00:00:38.329> changing<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.420> dimensions<00:00:39.929> in<00:00:40.320> the

make the image look okay it does not

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:51.659 
reduce the file size of the image so the

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:54.139 
reduce the file size of the image so the
physical<00:00:52.289> size<00:00:52.469> has<00:00:52.769> been<00:00:52.800> reduced<00:00:53.370> but<00:00:53.999> the

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
physical size has been reduced but the

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.959 
physical size has been reduced but the
file<00:00:54.390> size<00:00:54.659> remains<00:00:54.929> the<00:00:55.230> same<00:00:55.969> modern

cameras<00:00:57.300> capture<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.809> lot<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.199> detail<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.769> each

photo can be several megabytes in size
inserting<00:01:02.999> one<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.239> these<00:01:03.390> images<00:01:03.809> into<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.080> web

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
inserting one of these images into a web

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.710 
inserting one of these images into a web
page<00:01:04.589> means<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.610> page<00:01:05.820> will<00:01:06.060> take<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.420> long

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
page means the page will take a long

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.990

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
time to load and if you have several

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.880 
time to load and if you have several
photos<00:01:09.360> on<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.600> page<00:01:09.870> it<00:01:10.140> could<00:01:10.620> take<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.800> couple

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
photos on a page it could take a couple

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.770 
photos on a page it could take a couple
of<00:01:11.190> minutes<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.640> load<00:01:11.790> which<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.480> unacceptable

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
of minutes to load which is unacceptable

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.840 
of minutes to load which is unacceptable
so<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:16.050> is<00:01:16.230> vital<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.710> resize<00:01:17.280> your<00:01:17.310> images

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
so it is vital to resize your images

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.820 
so it is vital to resize your images
before<00:01:18.090> uploading<00:01:18.480> them<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.870> a<00:01:19.050> web<00:01:19.230> page<00:01:19.260> in

the<00:01:20.760> basics<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.570> introduce<00:01:22.170> an<00:01:22.350> online<00:01:22.740> tool

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
the basics I introduce an online tool

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.180 
the basics I introduce an online tool
called<00:01:23.310> picnic<00:01:24.440> however<00:01:25.440> this<00:01:25.560> application

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
called picnic however this application

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.340 
called picnic however this application
has<00:01:26.220> been<00:01:26.340> devoured<00:01:27.090> by<00:01:27.240> Google<00:01:27.660> and<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:28.170> looks

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
has been devoured by Google and it looks

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.140 
has been devoured by Google and it looks
like<00:01:28.440> it's<00:01:28.740> set<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.070> become<00:01:29.460> part<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.880> their

overall set of tools this won't suit

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.180 
overall set of tools this won't suit
everyone<00:01:33.510> so<00:01:33.810> let's<00:01:34.380> take<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.620> look<00:01:34.860> at<00:01:35.040> an
