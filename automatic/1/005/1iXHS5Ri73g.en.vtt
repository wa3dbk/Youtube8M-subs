00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
something that the media is taking it

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.859 
something that the media is taking it
far<00:01:35.100> greater<00:01:35.430> than<00:01:35.520> what<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.850> is

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
the thing that really staggered the

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.390 
the thing that really staggered the
public<00:02:18.480> was<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:18.959> fact<00:02:19.349> of<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.769> amounts<00:02:20.280> all

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
public was the fact of the amounts all

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.740 
public was the fact of the amounts all
of<00:02:20.459> a<00:02:20.519> sudden<00:02:20.760> it's<00:02:20.849> reported<00:02:21.360> that<00:02:21.450> she<00:02:21.510> lost

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
of a sudden it's reported that she lost

of a sudden it's reported that she lost
over<00:02:22.110> million<00:02:22.470> hours<00:02:22.830> playing<00:02:23.580> on<00:02:23.879> golf<00:02:24.180> that

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
over million hours playing on golf that

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.070 
over million hours playing on golf that
aminos<00:02:25.830> I<00:02:26.190> guess<00:02:26.640> I<00:02:26.790> would<00:02:27.000> be<00:02:27.030> sick<00:02:27.660> if<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:27.900> lost

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
aminos I guess I would be sick if I lost

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.780 
aminos I guess I would be sick if I lost
one<00:02:28.290> point<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:28.709> me<00:02:28.860> now<00:02:29.129> is<00:02:29.190> that<00:02:29.370> he<00:02:29.519> would<00:02:29.670> be

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
one point to me now is that he would be

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.789 
one point to me now is that he would be
sick<00:02:30.030> if<00:02:30.060> he<00:02:30.510> reduced<00:02:30.870> one<00:02:31.079> point<00:02:31.319> to<00:02:31.440> me<00:02:31.590> now

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
sick if he reduced one point to me now

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.000 
sick if he reduced one point to me now
except<00:02:32.340> three<00:02:32.660> 300,000<00:02:33.660> so<00:02:34.349> yeah<00:02:34.500> he<00:02:34.709> must<00:02:34.920> be

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
except three 300,000 so yeah he must be

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
except three 300,000 so yeah he must be
sick<00:02:35.280> if<00:02:35.489> that's<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.940> case<00:02:36.150> but<00:02:37.079> I<00:02:37.319> think<00:02:37.349> that

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
sick if that's the case but I think that

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.869 
sick if that's the case but I think that
he<00:02:39.530> exaggerated<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.769> a<00:02:40.829> point<00:02:41.099> and<00:02:41.370> I'm<00:02:41.549> and

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
he exaggerated to a point and I'm and

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.449 
he exaggerated to a point and I'm and
I've<00:02:42.150> come<00:02:42.569> up<00:02:42.690> with<00:02:42.720> my<00:02:42.840> own<00:02:43.340> conclusion<00:02:44.340> and

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
I've come up with my own conclusion and

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.789 
I've come up with my own conclusion and
why<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.670> exaggeration<00:02:45.450> was<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:46.019> 1.2<00:02:46.650> or

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
why the exaggeration was to 1.2 or

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.130 
why the exaggeration was to 1.2 or
whatever<00:02:47.670> was<00:02:47.910> that<00:02:47.940> it<00:02:48.420> sells<00:02:48.690> books

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
whatever was that it sells books

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.780 
whatever was that it sells books
it<00:02:49.379> sells<00:02:49.620> books<00:02:49.890> plus<00:02:50.670> for<00:02:51.510> guy<00:02:51.690> who<00:02:51.750> makes

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
it sells books plus for guy who makes

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.380 
it sells books plus for guy who makes
over<00:02:53.790> billion<00:02:54.269> dollars<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:55.680> lose<00:02:56.239> $300,000<00:02:57.239> is

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
over billion dollars to lose $300,000 is

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.360 
over billion dollars to lose $300,000 is
easy<00:02:57.569> acceptable<00:02:58.379> from<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.799> public<00:02:59.129> but<00:02:59.340> to

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
easy acceptable from the public but to

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.300 
easy acceptable from the public but to
say<00:02:59.730> he<00:02:59.910> lost<00:03:00.090> 1.2<00:03:00.959> then<00:03:01.769> the<00:03:01.859> public's<00:03:02.190> gonna

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
say he lost 1.2 then the public's gonna

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.099 
say he lost 1.2 then the public's gonna
look<00:03:02.430> at<00:03:02.609> his<00:03:02.730> hell<00:03:02.970> god<00:03:03.660> that's<00:03:03.810> a<00:03:03.930> lot<00:03:04.079> of

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
look at his hell god that's a lot of

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.589 
look at his hell god that's a lot of
money<00:03:04.349> you<00:03:04.889> know<00:03:04.920> that's<00:03:05.190> that's<00:03:05.430> a<00:03:05.670> 1.2<00:03:06.209> maybe

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
money you know that's that's a 1.2 maybe

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:09.050 
money you know that's that's a 1.2 maybe
does<00:03:06.870> have<00:03:07.049> a<00:03:07.109> problem<00:03:07.519> but<00:03:08.519> I<00:03:08.549> think<00:03:08.609> that<00:03:08.940> was

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
does have a problem but I think that was

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.309 
does have a problem but I think that was
one<00:03:09.209> of<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.389> reasons<00:03:09.690> that<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:09.900> numbers<00:03:10.200> are

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
one of the reasons that the numbers are

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.990 
one of the reasons that the numbers are
throwing<00:03:10.500> up<00:03:10.680> there<00:03:10.859> but<00:03:12.410> either<00:03:13.410> way<00:03:13.769> I<00:03:14.099> felt

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
throwing up there but either way I felt

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.270 
throwing up there but either way I felt
I<00:03:15.090> was<00:03:15.209> betrayed<00:03:15.599> by<00:03:15.810> this<00:03:15.870> individual

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
I was betrayed by this individual

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.809 
I was betrayed by this individual
