00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:07.769
 the forest for many young people nothing 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.389
 especially the so-called trails 

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:11.790
 and jumps should also be something 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.820
 very different in higher faster 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.189
 the motto is the downhill rider and it 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.039
 Increases more and more thrills 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.970
 Pure again occur and the pedals 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.810
 already is the top speed 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:28.940
 the kicker comes closer and 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.940
 saying so daniel feels like driving 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.579
 when downhill mountainbiking a must 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.440
 downhill route in terrain 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.120
 be driven as fast as possible 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.710
 next to the speed 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.469
 natural and artificial obstacles 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.420
 for added charm on the trails 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.460
 however, for the downhill 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.370
 especially bicycles and special 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.620
 equipment needed it applies more was 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.899
 sure the driver is the better 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.670
 his equipment will be 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:01:00.239
 daniel is just a very risky 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.829
 sport and despite sufficient 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.120
 Protectors can stop it again and again 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.799
 that is also difficult 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.959
 injuries like mine 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.409
 example splinters the clavicle 

00:01:06.959 --> 00:01:11.819
 and a broken knee 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:15.509
 the equipment is still to 

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:17.159
 risk minimization recommended but why 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.039
 Will this dangerous sport ever 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.709
 exercised for many of the drivers it is the 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:24.209
 community that everyone helps and you 

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:26.340
 together does anything 

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:28.289
 so, for example, you build new ones together 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.569
 trends and down together 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:32.759
 but for many it is just that 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:34.950
 possession of the ball or the adrenalin kick 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.789
 when driving or before the 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.789
 departure arises 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.780
 yes, especially to adrenaline you can 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.930
 say that this is a hormone which is in the 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.689
 body is formed and ultimately up 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.820
 the autonomic nervous system affects the 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.130
 Effect is, for example, increased 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.020
 Heart rate or a slope of the 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.880
 blood pressure and the human is then in 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.320
 the situation in the short term easy 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.810
 to be more efficient 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.880
 young people do not think much and 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.349
 Just go without worrying about the 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.630
 to be aware of risks 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.640
 of course, injuries also belong to it 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.250
 such as cruciate ligament tear and 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.950
 WirbelbrÃ¼che However, this exists 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.630
 risk sports in other one 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.170
 big danger is the fall on the 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.630
 neck 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.700
 to avoid this source of danger 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.560
 Many people are wearing neck protection 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.080
 driving a car causes some accidents 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.910
 because of other car drivers but when 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.310
 downhill and you have to yourself mostly 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.530
 responsible for accidents around the hobby 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.970
 It takes one to practice 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.970
 highest physical performance 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:50.459
 Nevertheless, there are many problems so that 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.709
 first big problem is that the high 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.600
 costs for the equipment and the bikes 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.880
 and for repairs in between 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.380
 In each case, there are always times 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.940
 second big problem are definitely 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.010
 the rangers you need a permit 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.400
 and somewhere in the forest ray build 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.709
 can 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.780
 when building any fast now 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.510
 without permission then it is illegal in it 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.340
 Demolished by the forester , the construction happens 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.380
 of the trail in agreement with the 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.720
 Rangers to daniel for many 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.700
 fascinating sport but you should 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.380
 know your limits and the necessary 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.459
 respect the speed around the 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.810
 have left 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.810
 And what do you think of it
