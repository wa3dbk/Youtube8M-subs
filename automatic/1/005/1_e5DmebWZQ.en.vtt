want<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.130> play<00:00:20.369> it<00:00:21.380> they<00:00:22.380> seem<00:00:22.619> quite<00:00:22.949> good<00:00:23.189> but

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430

want to play it they seem quite good but
i<00:00:23.730> think<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.210> range<00:00:24.420> is<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.660> bit<00:00:24.689> underpowered

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
i think the range is a bit underpowered

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.679 
i think the range is a bit underpowered
they<00:00:25.439> either<00:00:25.560> need<00:00:25.740> more<00:00:26.130> defense<00:00:26.490> or<00:00:26.820> more

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
they either need more defense or more

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.560 
they either need more defense or more
range<00:00:28.130> at<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.220> moment<00:00:29.300> they're<00:00:30.300> not<00:00:30.390> exactly

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
range at the moment they're not exactly

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.299 
range at the moment they're not exactly
balanced<00:00:31.320> with<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.500> rest<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:31.949> classes

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
balanced with the rest of the classes

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.650 
balanced with the rest of the classes
and<00:00:32.460> their<00:00:32.579> gear<00:00:32.790> doesn't<00:00:32.940> drop<00:00:33.210> in<00:00:33.329> soulbound

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660

the floor because that'd be boring

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:50.680 
the floor because that'd be boring
realized<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:39.059> lot<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.960> I'm<00:00:40.050> going<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:41.780> do<00:00:42.780> this

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.660 

as<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:52.050> guys<00:00:52.350> probably<00:00:52.410> know<00:00:52.949> do<00:00:53.250> things<00:00:53.280> been

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
as you guys probably know do things been

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.610 
as you guys probably know do things been
patched<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.390> lot<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.660> people<00:00:55.079> have<00:00:55.350> lost

really<00:00:56.129> good<00:00:56.250> stuff<00:00:56.280> already<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.940> think<00:00:57.600> it's

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
really good stuff already I think it's

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.110

fairer<00:00:58.500> with<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.370> can<00:00:59.550> patch<00:00:59.730> because<00:00:59.940> it

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
fairer with you can patch because it

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.610 
fairer with you can patch because it
means<00:01:00.270> people<00:01:00.480> who<00:01:00.750> aren't<00:01:00.989> skillful<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.530> I

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
means people who aren't skillful and I

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.979 
means people who aren't skillful and I

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.630 
could get the am is properly don't have
them<00:01:06.799> because<00:01:07.799> there<00:01:07.950> was<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.189> many<00:01:08.280> noobs

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
using comp than damage because they were

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:19.940 
using comp than damage because they were
so<00:01:11.250> cheap

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:36.750
