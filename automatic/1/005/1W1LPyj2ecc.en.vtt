into much detail of this because we're

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.650 
of the body it works second quarter it
goes<00:00:25.710> up<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.980> little<00:00:26.010> bit<00:00:26.310> more<00:00:26.490> this<00:00:27.480> for

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
goes up a little bit more this for

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.220 
goes up a little bit more this for
active<00:00:27.990> in<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:29.039> three<00:00:29.340> as<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.390> can<00:00:30.539> see<00:00:30.779> goes

up further and then for you know that
that's<00:00:35.130> really<00:00:35.399> as<00:00:35.460> far<00:00:35.520> as<00:00:35.790> my<00:00:35.880> people<00:00:35.940> would

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
that's really as far as my people would

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.430 
that's really as far as my people would
want<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.510> go<00:00:36.630> at<00:00:36.750> him<00:00:36.840> with<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.380> I'm

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
want to go at him with it and I'm

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.330 
want to go at him with it and I'm
putting<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.770> on<00:00:37.829> gently<00:00:38.450> now<00:00:39.800> if<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:41.010> didn't

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
putting it on gently now if I didn't

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.220 
putting it on gently now if I didn't
want<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.489> send<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:41.730> energy<00:00:42.149> through<00:00:42.570> his

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
want to send that energy through his

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.190 
want to send that energy through his
body<00:00:43.500> into<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.460> back<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.090> his<00:00:45.329> body<00:00:45.570> by

body into the back of his body by

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.799 
body into the back of his body by
circulating<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.309> energy<00:00:47.789> will<00:00:48.450> see<00:00:48.780> a

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
circulating the energy will see a

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.930 
circulating the energy will see a
completely<00:00:49.379> different<00:00:49.770> effect<00:00:50.070> on<00:00:50.550> dissa

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
completely different effect on dissa

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.360 
completely different effect on dissa
gently<00:00:51.420> as<00:00:51.480> I<00:00:51.570> can<00:00:51.840> okay<00:00:54.260> now<00:00:55.260> notice<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:56.039> I'm

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
gently as I can okay now notice that I'm

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.520 
gently as I can okay now notice that I'm
actually<00:00:56.670> letting<00:00:57.360> go<00:00:57.690> as<00:00:57.930> soon<00:00:58.230> as<00:00:58.410> that

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
actually letting go as soon as that

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.189 
actually letting go as soon as that
bites<00:01:00.530> we've<00:01:01.530> spoken<00:01:02.010> about<00:01:02.579> how<00:01:03.149> how<00:01:03.930> steve

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
bites we've spoken about how how steve

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.450 
bites we've spoken about how how steve
is<00:01:04.320> not<00:01:04.470> going<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.650> put<00:01:04.769> anything<00:01:04.949> on<00:01:05.189> for<00:01:05.400> the

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
is not going to put anything on for the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.130 
is not going to put anything on for the
cameras<00:01:05.850> please<00:01:06.479> just<00:01:06.689> explain<00:01:06.930> the

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
cameras please just explain the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.590 
cameras please just explain the
difference<00:01:07.409> as<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.740> felt<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.159> just<00:01:08.640> really

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
difference as you felt it just really

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.750 
difference as you felt it just really
really<00:01:11.180> it's<00:01:12.180> yeah<00:01:12.750> now<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.680> let<00:01:14.010> go<00:01:14.220> in<00:01:14.460> reality

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
really it's yeah now I let go in reality

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.609 
really it's yeah now I let go in reality
i'd<00:01:15.270> be<00:01:15.450> putting<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:15.840> on<00:01:15.990> as<00:01:16.110> hard<00:01:16.320> as<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.560> can

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
i'd be putting that on as hard as I can

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.530 
i'd be putting that on as hard as I can
and<00:01:16.830> i'll<00:01:17.070> be<00:01:17.189> putting<00:01:17.369> on<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.820> two<00:01:18.210> areas

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
and i'll be putting on to two areas

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.730 
and i'll be putting on to two areas
which<00:01:18.659> would<00:01:18.810> be<00:01:18.869> even<00:01:19.140> more<00:01:19.229> painful<00:01:19.470> but<00:01:19.710> the

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
which would be even more painful but the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.800 
which would be even more painful but the
spiraling<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.970> technique<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.509> really

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
spiraling of the technique is really

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.280 
spiraling of the technique is really
important<00:01:22.820> we<00:01:23.820> can<00:01:23.970> do<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.330> same<00:01:24.509> thing<00:01:24.869> from

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
important we can do the same thing from

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.460 
important we can do the same thing from
a<00:01:25.500> strike<00:01:26.270> so<00:01:27.270> i'm<00:01:27.720> just<00:01:27.780> going<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.110> get<00:01:28.229> c2

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
a strike so i'm just going to get c2

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.319 
a strike so i'm just going to get c2
tent<00:01:28.799> up<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.070> little<00:01:29.250> bit<00:01:29.400> ok<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:29.670> we<00:01:30.090> saw

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
tent up a little bit ok so we saw

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.780 
tent up a little bit ok so we saw
earlier<00:01:30.720> Steve<00:01:31.530> can<00:01:31.770> take<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> good<00:01:32.189> dig<00:01:32.460> no

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
earlier Steve can take a good dig no

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.050 
earlier Steve can take a good dig no
question<00:01:33.210> about<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.710> if<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:35.070> circulate<00:01:35.909> that

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
question about it if I circulate that

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.600 
question about it if I circulate that
energy<00:01:36.450> through<00:01:36.750> here<00:01:37.110> so<00:01:37.619> I'm<00:01:37.770> twisting

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
energy through here so I'm twisting

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:47.640 
energy through here so I'm twisting
round<00:01:38.909> as<00:01:39.119> I'm<00:01:39.240> actually<00:01:39.390> landing<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.960> strike

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.750 

good<00:01:49.270> okay<00:01:50.270> big<00:01:51.229> difference<00:01:51.620> now<00:01:52.310> we're<00:01:52.640> going

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
good okay big difference now we're going

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.300 
good okay big difference now we're going
to<00:01:52.880> see<00:01:53.090> it<00:01:53.240> see<00:01:53.780> a<00:01:53.810> street<00:01:54.530> application<00:01:55.190> for

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
to see it see a street application for

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.310 
to see it see a street application for
this<00:01:55.370> a<00:01:55.430> little<00:01:55.580> bit<00:01:55.760> later<00:01:55.940> on<00:01:56.180> but<00:01:56.240> just<00:01:56.570> to

breathing in all the intent it was just
purely<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.320> circulation<00:02:37.540> we<00:02:38.540> also<00:02:38.690> find<00:02:39.170> that

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
purely the circulation we also find that

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.699 
purely the circulation we also find that
will<00:02:40.100> work<00:02:40.310> brilliantly<00:02:40.790> on<00:02:41.269> probably<00:02:42.170> see

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
will work brilliantly on probably see

will work brilliantly on probably see
the<00:02:42.739> seventy<00:02:43.100> percent<00:02:43.190> of<00:02:43.489> the<00:02:43.850> of<00:02:44.269> the

the seventy percent of the of the

the seventy percent of the of the
Meridian<00:02:44.780> systems<00:02:45.230> we're<00:02:45.380> going<00:02:45.530> to<00:02:45.590> be

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
Meridian systems we're going to be

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.519 
Meridian systems we're going to be
exploring<00:02:46.400> today
