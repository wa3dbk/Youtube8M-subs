00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:11.389
 magic palette space and this time 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:13.699
 We are with leandro, well, you know 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.830
 the impact that the machine has had 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:19.310
 yes yes awesome 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:22.700
 this impressive good then like 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.790
 they ask us again and they say please the 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.760
 machine we want to see not only 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:32.689
 you brought them and six but another heap 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:35.180
 of machinery I would say and artifacts for 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.430
 to be able to work and do the real 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.160
 scrapbooking bros and let yourself rossi is 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.710
 good and what we are today we are going to 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.870
 present is a long right and we're going 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.180
 to do now in this life to 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.730
 very good look 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.210
 the good thing about this is that we're going to 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.820
 implement the route that the cheerleader 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.770
 We will also use sales to 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.250
 make the credit that is inside 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.170
 and to make these edges 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.940
 good to each time for example we brought a 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.490
 how are the bases are 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.050
 cartoncitos and lined with paper 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.110
 obviously acid free all the 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.150
 correct scheme and free of good acid 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.750
 if you want we can try the abwehr vale 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.400
 see that I explain this quickly 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.740
 of this that has good that is a 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.960
 fighter that helps us to make the 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.840
 perforations already know to visar well 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.580
 here for example with an album we can 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.690
 beyond use by another 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:34.110
 emiliano apart can use agendas in 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.110
 booklets 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.560
 the spiral that perforated the cartons 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.260
 the papers exactly come with a 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.180
 very easy palanquita camps are not 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.430
 four positions ones for the covers 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.920
 other tests leaves another that is the 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.680
 free system and another that is to go 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.200
 doing all the leaves or is all the 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.350
 long the leaves is a punch 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.800
 very tasty, so what 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.400
 you want and we will demonstrate it here with 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.400
 a little card 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.070
 17 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.070
 I do this 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.770
 for very well 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:31.470
 the noise has to look very good 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.840
 but you have to be a little bit of force but 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.110
 I'm sorry, but look how neat 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.700
 in beautiful liquid this looks then 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.960
 then what we have these are the 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.240
 sharp that we went through the 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.170
 little machine that we have put so much that 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.170
 I like everything 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.890
 go Go 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.130
 you have to remember that these are the 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.890
 big guys and you do not need any 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.700
 adapter and I think behind camera 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.700
 Everyone wants 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.840
 good and not there 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.760
 with the left so it's a bit 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.720
 difficult but I can assure you that a 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.720
 Once that happened it is already 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:24.209
 a query 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:27.569
 this bit so that edge the part 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:31.069
 short but very rich, just imagine what 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.069
 what would be to cut this scissor 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:39.480
 this yes or yes you need a tool 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:39.480
 that's the girls 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.230
 with this alone 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.830
 and now the front part where you do not have 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:53.400
 to stick your finger before I close 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.400
 with the new levers 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.220
 we have 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:08.100
 there is very good much better 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:11.850
 we can not in the middle yes and now 2 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:14.330
 but the fear there jumps straight loose 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.330
 fruits 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:20.829
 we show them what they do the tram 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.770
 freeze to give forest the die cuts 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.760
 these are parts of the decoration can 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.070
 have this album 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.130
 yes yes so good these are the points 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.050
 you have to look before I was practicing 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.170
 this one so as not to be embarrassed in the 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.000
 Fuzzy look at this press this is how 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:43.960
 a 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.960
 those who have good look at a wonder
