00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
of snapped in place unlike the other

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.600 
of snapped in place unlike the other
side<00:00:06.690> in<00:00:07.170> the<00:00:07.319> front<00:00:07.620> area<00:00:07.799> you'll<00:00:08.189> notice<00:00:08.490> if

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
side in the front area you'll notice if

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.570 
side in the front area you'll notice if
you<00:00:08.670> pull<00:00:09.000> up<00:00:09.030> on<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.300> back<00:00:09.450> it'll<00:00:09.780> move<00:00:10.080> and

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:10.580 
you pull up on the back it'll move and

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.310 
you pull up on the back it'll move and
it<00:00:11.580> feels<00:00:11.969> like<00:00:12.269> something's<00:00:12.719> kind<00:00:13.170> of

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
it feels like something's kind of

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.460 
it feels like something's kind of
holding<00:00:13.620> it<00:00:13.679> down<00:00:14.240> but<00:00:15.240> there<00:00:15.660> is<00:00:15.839> nothing

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
holding it down but there is nothing

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.740 
holding it down but there is nothing
that<00:00:17.779> I<00:00:18.779> can<00:00:19.439> see<00:00:19.800> all<00:00:20.210> right<00:00:21.210> so<00:00:21.449> you<00:00:21.600> have

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
that I can see all right so you have

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.910 
that I can see all right so you have
these<00:00:21.869> two<00:00:21.930> wires<00:00:22.230> right<00:00:22.439> here<00:00:22.500> your<00:00:22.710> stick

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
these two wires right here your stick

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.939 
these two wires right here your stick
you<00:00:23.670> got<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.910> band<00:00:24.150> which<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.289> unfortunately

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
you got the band which I unfortunately

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.980 
you got the band which I unfortunately
do<00:00:26.430> not<00:00:26.460> know<00:00:26.760> how<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:26.910> take<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.300> off<00:00:27.480> or

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
do not know how to take that off or

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.500 
do not know how to take that off or

wires off pull this off and then these
are<00:00:44.219> only<00:00:44.489> now<00:00:44.730> connected<00:00:46.190> by<00:00:47.190> this<00:00:47.250> bad<00:00:48.860> I'll

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
are only now connected by this bad I'll

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.380 
are only now connected by this bad I'll
set<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.070> down

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:01.520 

yeah<00:00:54.390> there's<00:00:54.660> two<00:00:54.840> parts<00:01:00.199> now<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.350> we<00:01:01.410> have

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
yeah there's two parts now that we have

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.290 
yeah there's two parts now that we have
these<00:01:01.620> two<00:01:01.680> parts

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
these two parts

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.200 
these two parts
pretty<00:01:03.300> much<00:01:04.070> if<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.339> really<00:01:05.880> wanted<00:01:06.090> to

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
pretty much if you really wanted to

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.670 
pretty much if you really wanted to
separate<00:01:06.510> this<00:01:06.720> I'm<00:01:06.930> sure<00:01:07.170> there's<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.439> way<00:01:07.650> to

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
separate this I'm sure there's a way to

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.620 
separate this I'm sure there's a way to
I<00:01:07.920> didn't<00:01:08.760> really<00:01:08.939> want<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.150> mess<00:01:09.299> with<00:01:09.330> it

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
I didn't really want to mess with it

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.830 
I didn't really want to mess with it
there's<00:01:09.810> no<00:01:10.049> reason<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.530> at<00:01:10.950> all<00:01:11.159> honesty<00:01:11.840> you

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
there's no reason to at all honesty you

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.999 
there's no reason to at all honesty you
can<00:01:13.500> now<00:01:14.180> take<00:01:16.130> one<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.280> your<00:01:19.009> screwdrivers

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
can now take one of your screwdrivers

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:30.620 
can now take one of your screwdrivers
and<00:01:20.280> unscrew<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:22.380> three<00:01:23.900> screws<00:01:29.630> holding

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
and unscrew the three screws holding

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.840 
and unscrew the three screws holding
down<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.990> chip<00:01:31.259> this<00:01:32.130> will<00:01:32.310> also<00:01:32.460> allow<00:01:32.700> you

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
down the chip this will also allow you

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:41.090 
down the chip this will also allow you
to<00:01:33.180> remove<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:38.780> scroll<00:01:39.780> wheel<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.200> get<00:01:41.009> to

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
to remove the scroll wheel and get to

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.710 
to remove the scroll wheel and get to
the<00:01:41.189> LEDs<00:01:41.549> it's<00:01:41.790> also<00:01:41.970> let<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.329> get<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.630> the

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
the LEDs it's also let you get to the

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.270 
the LEDs it's also let you get to the
LEDs<00:01:43.049> under<00:01:43.439> your<00:01:45.049> big<00:01:46.049> LEDs<00:01:46.500> which<00:01:46.799> powers

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
LEDs under your big LEDs which powers

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.499 
LEDs under your big LEDs which powers
the<00:01:49.369> little<00:01:50.369> laser<00:01:50.549> symbol<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.299> on<00:01:51.420> the

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
the little laser symbol that is on the

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.480 
the little laser symbol that is on the
front<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.750> your<00:01:51.810> mouse<00:01:52.020> this<00:01:52.590> big<00:01:52.829> LED<00:01:53.220> right

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
front of your mouse this big LED right

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.810 
front of your mouse this big LED right
here<00:01:53.759> it's<00:01:54.149> on<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.360> very<00:01:55.189> back<00:01:56.189> end<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.670> the

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
here it's on the very back end of the

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.999 
here it's on the very back end of the
mouse<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.869> one's<00:01:58.079> probably<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.439> easiest<00:01:58.799> to

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
mouse that one's probably the easiest to

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.039 
mouse that one's probably the easiest to
replace<00:01:59.780> I<00:02:01.430> have<00:02:02.430> very<00:02:02.729> small<00:02:03.390> knowledge<00:02:03.750> as

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
replace I have very small knowledge as

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.810 
replace I have very small knowledge as
far<00:02:04.079> as<00:02:04.320> soldering<00:02:04.740> things<00:02:05.219> on<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.460> circuit

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
far as soldering things on the circuit

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.089 
far as soldering things on the circuit
boards<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.270> stuff<00:02:06.570> like<00:02:06.719> that<00:02:06.930> goes<00:02:07.140> but<00:02:08.069> I

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
boards and stuff like that goes but I

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.070 
boards and stuff like that goes but I
could<00:02:08.369> definitely<00:02:08.429> do<00:02:08.729> that<00:02:08.879> one<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.840> other

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
could definitely do that one the other

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.840 
could definitely do that one the other
ones<00:02:10.289> are<00:02:10.440> really

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
ones are really

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.540 
ones are really
small<00:02:11.180> like<00:02:11.510> the<00:02:11.660> ones<00:02:11.840> inside<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:13.040> scroll

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
small like the ones inside the scroll

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.250 
small like the ones inside the scroll
wheel<00:02:13.700> and<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.240> ones<00:02:14.420> inside<00:02:14.720> your<00:02:14.930> buttons

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
wheel and the ones inside your buttons

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.000 
wheel and the ones inside your buttons
over<00:02:15.890> here<00:02:16.330> those<00:02:17.330> I<00:02:17.690> could<00:02:18.590> really<00:02:18.920> use

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
over here those I could really use

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.920 
over here those I could really use
someone's<00:02:19.430> advice<00:02:19.580> on<00:02:20.000> how<00:02:20.300> you<00:02:20.360> go<00:02:20.840> about

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
someone's advice on how you go about

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.170 
someone's advice on how you go about
doing<00:02:21.260> that<00:02:21.440> once<00:02:22.400> you<00:02:22.490> get<00:02:22.550> those<00:02:22.730> three<00:02:22.910> out

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
doing that once you get those three out

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.700 
doing that once you get those three out
you<00:02:23.480> can<00:02:23.690> pretty<00:02:23.960> much<00:02:24.020> just<00:02:24.110> pull<00:02:24.500> straight

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
you can pretty much just pull straight

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.990 
you can pretty much just pull straight

this<00:02:48.500> just<00:02:48.710> like<00:02:48.830> a<00:02:48.860> screw<00:02:49.220> so<00:02:49.940> toss<00:02:50.120> it<00:02:50.300> in

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
this just like a screw so toss it in

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.090 
this just like a screw so toss it in
with<00:02:50.570> the<00:02:50.720> screws<00:02:51.640> also<00:02:52.640> the<00:02:52.820> 3<00:02:53.920> circuit<00:02:54.920> board

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
with the screws also the 3 circuit board

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.130 
with the screws also the 3 circuit board
screws<00:02:55.340> on<00:02:56.090> there<00:02:56.920> and<00:02:57.920> now<00:02:58.130> you<00:02:58.190> have<00:02:59.140> these

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
screws on there and now you have these

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.080 
screws on there and now you have these
components<00:03:00.680> your<00:03:01.160> board<00:03:01.400> with<00:03:01.700> a<00:03:01.730> scroll

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.030 
components your board with a scroll
wheel<00:03:02.180> on<00:03:02.390> it<00:03:02.450> which<00:03:03.140> we<00:03:03.320> will<00:03:03.500> take<00:03:03.680> off<00:03:03.830> right

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
wheel on it which we will take off right

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.970 
wheel on it which we will take off right
now<00:03:05.920> just<00:03:06.920> pull<00:03:07.600> to<00:03:08.600> the<00:03:08.690> side<00:03:08.930> it'll<00:03:09.620> be<00:03:09.800> to

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
now just pull to the side it'll be to

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.730 
now just pull to the side it'll be to
your<00:03:10.070> right<00:03:10.280> and<00:03:10.670> it'll<00:03:11.600> pop<00:03:11.870> the<00:03:12.320> one<00:03:12.500> side

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740 
your right and it'll pop the one side

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.490 
your right and it'll pop the one side
out<00:03:13.180> this<00:03:14.180> is<00:03:14.360> I'll<00:03:14.540> be<00:03:14.720> able<00:03:14.780> how<00:03:15.110> about<00:03:15.350> like

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
out this is I'll be able how about like

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.630 
out this is I'll be able how about like
a<00:03:15.620> metal<00:03:16.070> clamp

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
a metal clamp

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.030 
a metal clamp
looks<00:03:17.120> like<00:03:17.330> pull<00:03:18.020> that<00:03:18.140> out<00:03:18.320> your<00:03:18.860> wheel

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
looks like pull that out your wheel

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.680 
looks like pull that out your wheel
comes<00:03:19.370> straight<00:03:19.760> out<00:03:19.820> it'll<00:03:20.240> look<00:03:20.390> just<00:03:20.450> like

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
comes straight out it'll look just like

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.020 
comes straight out it'll look just like
this<00:03:22.180> set<00:03:23.180> down<00:03:23.360> here<00:03:24.250> will<00:03:25.250> not<00:03:25.430> need<00:03:25.670> it<00:03:25.790> I

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
this set down here will not need it I

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.820 
this set down here will not need it I
was<00:03:26.540> thinking<00:03:26.570> about<00:03:26.840> maybe<00:03:27.050> painting<00:03:27.620> these

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
was thinking about maybe painting these

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.540 
was thinking about maybe painting these
translucent<00:03:28.840> ends<00:03:29.860> this<00:03:30.860> is<00:03:31.010> I<00:03:31.100> kind<00:03:31.280> of<00:03:31.310> do<00:03:31.520> a

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
translucent ends this is I kind of do a

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.280 
translucent ends this is I kind of do a
little<00:03:31.670> modding<00:03:32.090> to<00:03:32.240> it<00:03:32.390> but<00:03:32.600> we'll<00:03:32.840> see

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
little modding to it but we'll see

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.410 
little modding to it but we'll see
hey<00:03:33.950> girls<00:03:34.280> I'll<00:03:34.400> make<00:03:34.520> update<00:03:34.850> videos<00:03:35.180> as<00:03:35.360> far

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
hey girls I'll make update videos as far

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.200 
hey girls I'll make update videos as far
as<00:03:35.660> that<00:03:35.840> is<00:03:36.230> concerned<00:03:38.650> alright<00:03:39.650> and<00:03:40.370> then<00:03:40.700> we

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.210 
as that is concerned alright and then we

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.320 
as that is concerned alright and then we
will<00:03:41.590> now<00:03:42.590> have<00:03:42.770> the<00:03:43.100> empty<00:03:43.400> board<00:03:43.640> nothing

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
will now have the empty board nothing

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:45.850 
will now have the empty board nothing
else<00:03:44.480> really<00:03:44.630> on<00:03:44.840> it<00:03:44.990> pretty<00:03:45.170> much<00:03:45.350> just<00:03:45.410> plug

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
else really on it pretty much just plug

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:52.440 
else really on it pretty much just plug
 into<00:03:46.340> it<00:03:47.890> so<00:03:48.890> you<00:03:49.310> have<00:03:49.760> four<00:03:50.480> screws

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
 into it so you have four screws

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.080 
 into it so you have four screws
right<00:03:53.450> here<00:03:54.010> let<00:03:55.010> me<00:03:55.040> see<00:03:55.370> those<00:03:55.520> four<00:03:55.790> screws

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
right here let me see those four screws

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:02.860 
right here let me see those four screws
the<00:03:56.390> metal<00:03:56.660> this<00:03:57.440> will<00:03:57.620> disconnect<00:03:58.390> the<00:04:01.870> the

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
the metal this will disconnect the the

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.670 
the metal this will disconnect the the
