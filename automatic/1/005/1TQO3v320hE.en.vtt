00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.020
 chain of predators 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.920
 so we have the producer there 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.589
 which in May 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.709
 and the secondary consumer 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:11.879
 - for us too 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:14.879
 we have the chain of predators 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.609
 we have the bottom of a pond 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:19.849
 producer 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:21.390
 the aquatic plant 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.079
 the mollusk 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:25.029
 as a criminal sink 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.560
 you get your food but everything 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.050
 the stem leaves that aquatic plant 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.410
 then we have the secondary consumer fish that feeds on itself 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.610
 mollusc 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.220
 we have a chain where the producer has because the aquatic plant the 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.420
 mollusc than the plenary consumer 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.560
 I think it's the secondary consumer 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.680
 next to us we have a cover 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.460
 ask to fish your fish 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.880
 in this case if we introduce stable in the chain it happens to be a consumer 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.000
 is due to the area of â€‹â€‹the chain of predators 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.430
 observed 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:09.400
 we then have a chain of parasites the chain of predators and we 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.640
 we also have a chain that can be mixed 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.909
 where we will have consumers to avoid cpi consumers councilors 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.810
 but if not always we have a linear sequence air 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.030
 is that of the tropic relationships that the food chain 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.870
 in some cases we will have several chains 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.860
 bringing together what we call a web mend 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.660
 the food web are these 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.670
 inter-relations between food chains 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.580
 How are we going to write? 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.830
 and I would like you to accompany in the following example demonstrating that 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.080
 it was a food to feed 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.240
 is the producer the vegetable 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.060
 who is producing your food 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.060
 for the man who the primary consumer 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.700
 and also for chicken 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.929
 consumer 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:02.330
 primary im 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.640
 one more man 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.359
 I hated chicken. 

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:09.380
 then he becomes a consumer 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.380
 secondary to ingesting chicken 

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:16.849
 I the whole line as the increase can serve as food 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.569
 for the technician 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.580
 the verdict when to eat 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.219
 of the chicken when he arrives with it found in physics on the line he is a 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:29.219
 secondary consumer in this chain 

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:33.829
 all the value found in man's gut 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.159
 he can be a secondary consumer 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:38.579
 tertiary 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:43.159
 in the sequence why because man is primary then the secondary worm 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:46.419
 when the man is secondary the worm is also 

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:47.549
 this scenario 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.119
 now watch 

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:52.979
 both the man and the hen as the worm and thus the corn 

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:54.749
 They are all 

00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:59.909
 of compounds undergo the process of decomposition by bacteria and fungi 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.420
 and are transformed into nutrients 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.700
 and these attendants stayed at the council only 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.989
 reused by the producer 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.390
 closing the cycle of matter in the food chain 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:14.409
 it's a matter 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:17.129
 matter is transferred 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.609
 from one traffic level to the other that will also enter 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.929
 producer corresponds to the first level of trafficking in the chain 

00:03:23.929 --> 00:03:27.440
 consumer to the second level of trafficking 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.500
 secondary consumer third level traffic 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.079
 and so on 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:37.539
 and now I would like you to remember that initial question 

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:42.189
 note the question 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:45.189
 what is the role of each living being in the environment 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.310
 so we have 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.540
 the producers 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.319
 are always represented by the group of vegetables the terrestrial vegetables 

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:57.149
 from a fruit that is a product of the vegetable 

00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:59.599
 so too as the algae 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:03.009
 seaweeds are also aquatic producers 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.959
 and basic algae also in freshwater classes 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:11.270
 or we also have the primary consumers 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.370
 because they are considered the herbivores are the animals if it loses binho holes 

00:04:16.059 --> 00:04:19.189
 are those who feed on southern vegetable 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.830
 secondary consumers are carnivores 

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:28.459
 are the animals that feed on the primary consumers 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:31.039
 consumers 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:34.659
 telecine areas are carnivores as well 

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:37.539
 are the animals that feed douch 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:39.050
 secondary 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.289
 by the end we will have the chain grant composers 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:46.699
 which are represented by bacteria and 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.740
 As we just got right, we have a food chain, the producer only 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.159
 consumer has composer 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:57.519
 in many cases we have the man as being a herbivore 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.100
 feed on vegetables but we can also have man as a carnivore if 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.540
 feeding from another vicious kirby fihri animal 

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:12.209
 as man he occupies two trophic levels feeding on the producer 

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:13.789
 as well as 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:14.830
 it is hard 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.360
 consumer in the case of another animal and will also receive another 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.430
 name 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.710
 it is classified into three calls 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.159
 the bus feeds on everything 

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.279
 feeds 

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:30.279
 both of the product and of another consumer 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:36.580
 we also have not only more man with other animals that also have this 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:37.320
 same 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.520
 position of a Canadian food chain 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.509
 as well as mini-games are also classified as having 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:49.240
 burns that are those animals that feed on the accident screams of a 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.460
 food chain 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.090
 We are going to need 30 last Saturday. 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.080
 the remains the animals 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.129
 it from decaying vegetables 

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:03.389
 and so we think about our class talking about the role of each living being 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.999
 in a food chain 

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:09.650
 who is the ideal car, but is it for our next biology class? 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:10.670
 until then
