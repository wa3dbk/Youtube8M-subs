of<00:01:02.899> ergonomics<00:01:03.899> if<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.110> will<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:05.000> it's<00:01:06.000> got<00:01:06.119> a

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
of ergonomics if you will and it's got a

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.270 
of ergonomics if you will and it's got a
unique<00:01:06.450> feature<00:01:06.720> where<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.409> can<00:01:07.680> go<00:01:07.950> forward

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
but you also go in reverse reverse will

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.160 
but you also go in reverse reverse will
give<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.159> braking<00:01:11.820> ability<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.900> in<00:01:12.990> case

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
give you braking ability so in case

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.390 
give you braking ability so in case
something<00:01:13.500> darts<00:01:13.770> in<00:01:13.890> front<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.250> you<00:01:14.340> for

you<00:01:31.979> can<00:01:32.130> just<00:01:32.340> pedal<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:32.759> reverse<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.210> just

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
you can just pedal in reverse and just

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.630 
you can just pedal in reverse and just
intuitively<00:01:34.020> have<00:01:34.590> total<00:01:34.950> control<00:01:35.070> over<00:01:35.340> the
