looked up and watched the Stars move

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.080 
looked up and watched the Stars move
across<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.200> sky<00:00:13.469> throughout<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.130> night<00:00:14.340> in

then<00:00:23.790> in<00:00:23.940> the<00:00:24.029> 16th<00:00:24.510> century<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:25.199> new<00:00:25.529> idea<00:00:25.949> was

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
then in the 16th century a new idea was

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.950 
then in the 16th century a new idea was
proposed<00:00:26.610> by<00:00:26.850> the<00:00:26.910> astronomer<00:00:27.570> Nikolai

Copernicus Copernicus suggested that the

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:32.879 
apparent motion of the Stars was caused

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:35.060 
apparent motion of the Stars was caused
by<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.150> movement<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.629> the<00:00:33.720> earth<00:00:33.840> as<00:00:34.170> the

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:51.330 
clear that the movement of the Stars

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.829 
clear that the movement of the Stars
overhead<00:00:51.659> is<00:00:52.110> an<00:00:52.229> illusion<00:00:52.680> but<00:00:53.250> then<00:00:53.549> in<00:00:53.839> 1718
