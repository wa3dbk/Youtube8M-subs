00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:41.610
 rose petal is a thin line thick and 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:50.340
 again thin and so all the petals now i 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:56.869
 I'll show you just clicked fat 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.869

 thin click on the brush let go horse 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:14.830
 so then where were we thin intersection 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.230
 on these places should be thick 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.540
 line 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:25.740
 staggered there was doing again 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.740

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:38.609
 let me so easy 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.459
 I, therefore , slightly tore off the line 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:44.299
 can make it a little by volume not 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:47.340
 that is, these thick lines still do 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:49.980
 wider then it will look like 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:55.430
 volume pretty even 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:03:05.609
 and here everything is done pestles one finely 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:12.859
 pressing and again subtly such a rosette 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:17.760
