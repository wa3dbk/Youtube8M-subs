 very good people with a lot of desire too 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.550
 discovering what this type of 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.830
 practices is that they always leave 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:57.950
 discovering new things 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.950
 [Music] 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.100
 not everyone who comes here and then 

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:04.810
 it ends up being a professional there are people 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.750
 that he does have his interest and other people who 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.269
 comes will have a good time to self-improve 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.049
 and then everyone works with their 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.049
 own limit 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:22.189
 On the one hand, training demands 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.560
 to stay in order to be in 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:26.160
 been like to continue discovering 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.950
 things 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.130
 I'm practicing what I do not now 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.010
 I'm in a suit but I come from there 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.920
 tie suit and I come with that clamp and 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:41.130
 came out the training clothes and ends 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.310
 but something very rare usually people 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.020
 Younger the one that comes here and they finish 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.000
 saying that I'm clear that I do not 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.190
 inside with work clothes is something and 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.700
 between the practice clothes and that's very 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.819
 funny 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.950
 I hope you liked what they saw 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:01.060

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.060
 what they have to do is cheer up
