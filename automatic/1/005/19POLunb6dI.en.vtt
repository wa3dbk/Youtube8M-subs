ways<00:00:14.780> to<00:00:15.080> record<00:00:15.470> an<00:00:15.650> acoustic<00:00:16.070> guitar

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
ways to record an acoustic guitar

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.260 
ways to record an acoustic guitar
firstly<00:00:18.740> we<00:00:19.220> want<00:00:19.370> to<00:00:19.520> make<00:00:19.700> sure<00:00:19.730> that<00:00:20.210> our

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
firstly we want to make sure that our

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.359 
firstly we want to make sure that our
Priya<00:00:20.630> has<00:00:20.930> enough<00:00:21.230> signal<00:00:21.650> to<00:00:21.860> capture<00:00:22.220> the

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
Priya has enough signal to capture the

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:24.370 
Priya has enough signal to capture the
sound<00:00:22.550> we<00:00:23.480> want<00:00:23.690> to<00:00:23.779> find<00:00:24.050> the<00:00:24.200> most

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
sound we want to find the most

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.769 
sound we want to find the most
comfortable<00:00:24.529> position<00:00:25.040> for<00:00:25.490> the<00:00:25.730> musician<00:00:26.180> so

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
comfortable position for the musician so

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.560 
comfortable position for the musician so
he<00:00:26.930> can<00:00:27.080> play<00:00:27.260> his<00:00:27.440> instrument<00:00:27.980> adequately<00:00:28.570> we

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
he can play his instrument adequately we

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.999 
he can play his instrument adequately we
are<00:00:29.689> asking<00:00:30.020> him<00:00:30.110> to<00:00:30.259> start<00:00:30.500> playing<00:00:30.770> and

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
are asking him to start playing and

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.070 
are asking him to start playing and
while<00:00:31.310> he<00:00:31.460> does<00:00:31.700> we<00:00:32.119> will<00:00:32.270> be<00:00:32.419> adjusting<00:00:32.930> the

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:33.080 
while he does we will be adjusting the

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.350 
while he does we will be adjusting the
microphone<00:00:33.560> on<00:00:33.710> the<00:00:33.800> sound<00:00:34.190> source<00:00:34.490> we<00:00:35.329> will

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
microphone on the sound source we will

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.330 
microphone on the sound source we will
start<00:00:35.780> at<00:00:35.990> a<00:00:36.020> standard<00:00:36.350> point<00:00:36.680> which<00:00:37.220> is

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
start at a standard point which is

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:50.250 
start at a standard point which is
around<00:00:37.579> the<00:00:37.730> 12th<00:00:38.000> fret

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.960 

then<00:00:51.260> we<00:00:51.560> will<00:00:51.680> readjust<00:00:51.980> our<00:00:52.340> preamp<00:00:52.790> to

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
then we will readjust our preamp to

00:00:52.970 --> 00:01:10.359 
then we will readjust our preamp to
obtain<00:00:53.360> a<00:00:53.540> good<00:00:53.809> sounding<00:00:54.200> level<00:01:09.190> once<00:01:10.190> I've

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
obtain a good sounding level once I've

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.219 
obtain a good sounding level once I've
done<00:01:10.520> this<00:01:10.580> I'm<00:01:10.940> going<00:01:11.300> to<00:01:11.420> once<00:01:11.600> again<00:01:11.720> adjust

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
done this I'm going to once again adjust

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:13.750 
done this I'm going to once again adjust
the<00:01:12.380> microphone<00:01:12.560> position<00:01:12.950> to<00:01:13.369> find<00:01:13.610> the

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
the microphone position to find the

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.630 
the microphone position to find the
sound<00:01:14.030> the<00:01:14.630> artist<00:01:15.020> and<00:01:15.200> I<00:01:15.320> are<00:01:15.500> happy<00:01:15.680> with

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.219 

one<00:01:19.640> way<00:01:19.850> I<00:01:19.880> recommend<00:01:20.270> to<00:01:20.509> do<00:01:20.630> this<00:01:20.810> is<00:01:21.080> to

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
one way I recommend to do this is to

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.020 
one way I recommend to do this is to
take<00:01:21.350> a<00:01:21.410> pair<00:01:21.710> of<00:01:21.740> headphones<00:01:21.979> so<00:01:22.550> we<00:01:22.670> can<00:01:22.790> hear

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
take a pair of headphones so we can hear

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.670 
take a pair of headphones so we can hear
the<00:01:23.060> adjustments<00:01:23.750> we<00:01:23.869> are<00:01:23.990> making<00:01:24.200> in<00:01:24.440> real

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
the adjustments we are making in real

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.410 
the adjustments we are making in real
time

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.550 

next<00:01:29.420> I<00:01:29.570> will<00:01:29.720> move<00:01:29.869> the<00:01:29.990> microphone<00:01:30.440> around

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
next I will move the microphone around

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.710 
next I will move the microphone around
the<00:01:30.860> instrument<00:01:31.160> finding<00:01:32.090> the<00:01:32.180> position<00:01:32.360> that

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
the instrument finding the position that

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.430 
the instrument finding the position that
gives<00:01:32.899> us<00:01:33.200> our<00:01:33.380> favorite<00:01:33.710> sound<00:01:34.100> to<00:01:34.250> our<00:01:34.280> ears

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
gives us our favorite sound to our ears

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.960 
gives us our favorite sound to our ears
once<00:01:36.440> we<00:01:36.619> find<00:01:36.890> that<00:01:36.979> sweet<00:01:37.220> spot<00:01:37.280> we<00:01:37.820> will

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
once we find that sweet spot we will

00:01:37.970 --> 00:02:00.020 
once we find that sweet spot we will
secure<00:01:38.330> the<00:01:38.479> mic<00:01:38.690> so<00:01:39.050> that<00:01:39.080> it<00:01:39.289> does<00:01:39.410> not<00:01:39.440> move

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.610 

we<00:02:01.030> will<00:02:01.150> just<00:02:01.420> to<00:02:01.570> preempt<00:02:01.990> to<00:02:02.110> make<00:02:02.290> sure<00:02:02.470> the

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
we will just to preempt to make sure the

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:12.090 
we will just to preempt to make sure the
volume<00:02:02.770> is<00:02:03.100> at<00:02:03.250> a<00:02:03.280> healthy<00:02:03.610> mode<00:02:10.770> it<00:02:11.770> is<00:02:11.950> also

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
volume is at a healthy mode it is also

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.920 
volume is at a healthy mode it is also
recommended<00:02:12.459> to<00:02:12.850> record<00:02:13.180> the<00:02:13.300> signal<00:02:13.660> just<00:02:13.780> to

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
recommended to record the signal just to

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.900 
recommended to record the signal just to
take<00:02:14.110> a<00:02:14.140> quick<00:02:14.410> look<00:02:14.620> at<00:02:14.800> the<00:02:14.890> waveform<00:02:15.100> just

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
take a quick look at the waveform just

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.240 
take a quick look at the waveform just
to<00:02:16.000> make<00:02:16.150> sure<00:02:16.180> we<00:02:16.600> have<00:02:16.810> good<00:02:17.200> levels<00:02:17.560> it's

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
to make sure we have good levels it's

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.040 
to make sure we have good levels it's
not<00:02:18.459> a<00:02:18.490> rule<00:02:18.730> it's<00:02:19.000> just<00:02:19.209> something<00:02:19.510> I<00:02:19.660> do<00:02:19.750> that

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
not a rule it's just something I do that

00:02:20.050 --> 00:03:24.210 
not a rule it's just something I do that
helps<00:02:20.290> me

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.619 

here<00:03:25.220> we<00:03:25.340> have<00:03:25.459> the<00:03:25.550> recorded<00:03:26.060> guitar<00:03:26.330> and<00:03:26.480> Pro

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:26.629 
here we have the recorded guitar and Pro

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:28.900 
here we have the recorded guitar and Pro
Tools<00:03:26.870> let's<00:03:27.530> start<00:03:27.739> mixing<00:03:27.950> and<00:03:28.250> add<00:03:28.700> some

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
Tools let's start mixing and add some

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.030 
Tools let's start mixing and add some
processing<00:03:29.360> let's<00:03:30.050> select<00:03:30.319> the<00:03:30.470> section<00:03:30.860> and

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
processing let's select the section and

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:39.570 
processing let's select the section and
loop<00:03:31.190> it<00:03:31.310> first

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:52.520 

firstly<00:03:40.580> we're<00:03:41.030> going<00:03:41.060> to<00:03:41.300> add<00:03:41.450> an<00:03:41.600> EQ

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.600 

I'm<00:03:53.530> going<00:03:53.770> to<00:03:53.890> boost<00:03:54.100> the<00:03:54.220> mid<00:03:54.460> high

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
I'm going to boost the mid high

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.550 
I'm going to boost the mid high
frequencies<00:03:55.150> a<00:03:55.180> bit<00:03:55.450> to<00:03:55.630> add<00:03:55.780> some<00:03:55.990> definition

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
frequencies a bit to add some definition

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:03.420 
frequencies a bit to add some definition
to<00:03:56.590> the<00:03:56.770> sound<00:04:01.710> then<00:04:02.710> I'm<00:04:02.830> going<00:04:03.070> to<00:04:03.160> cut<00:04:03.340> the

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
to the sound then I'm going to cut the

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.500 
to the sound then I'm going to cut the
lows<00:04:05.490> just<00:04:06.490> a<00:04:06.580> bit<00:04:06.730> to<00:04:06.880> eliminate<00:04:07.300> any

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
lows just a bit to eliminate any

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:14.130 
lows just a bit to eliminate any
undesired<00:04:08.170> or<00:04:08.410> needless<00:04:08.920> sounds<00:04:12.750> again<00:04:13.750> I'm

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
undesired or needless sounds again I'm

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.720 
undesired or needless sounds again I'm
going<00:04:14.320> to<00:04:14.410> boost<00:04:14.680> the<00:04:14.770> high<00:04:14.890> frequencies<00:04:15.400> just

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
going to boost the high frequencies just

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:31.550 
going to boost the high frequencies just
a<00:04:15.790> loop

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.380 

now<00:04:32.560> I'm<00:04:32.860> going<00:04:33.190> to<00:04:33.310> insert<00:04:33.550> a<00:04:33.640> compressor<00:04:34.120> to

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
now I'm going to insert a compressor to

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.830 
now I'm going to insert a compressor to
control<00:04:34.720> the<00:04:34.810> dynamics

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.020 

like<00:04:38.410> I<00:04:38.500> said<00:04:38.560> before<00:04:38.889> I<00:04:39.340> like<00:04:39.820> this

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
like I said before I like this

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.340 
like I said before I like this
compressor<00:04:40.480> because<00:04:40.720> it's<00:04:40.870> very<00:04:41.050> easy<00:04:41.169> to<00:04:41.410> use

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
compressor because it's very easy to use

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.510 
compressor because it's very easy to use
I'm<00:04:44.350> always<00:04:44.560> going<00:04:44.740> to<00:04:44.830> trying<00:04:45.160> only

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
I'm always going to trying only

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.159 
I'm always going to trying only
compressed<00:04:45.910> up<00:04:46.090> to<00:04:46.210> one<00:04:46.360> and<00:04:46.510> a<00:04:46.570> half<00:04:46.600> two

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
compressed up to one and a half two

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:58.470 
compressed up to one and a half two
decibels<00:04:56.580> now<00:04:57.580> let's<00:04:57.790> open<00:04:57.940> an<00:04:58.150> auxiliary

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.480 
decibels now let's open an auxiliary

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.440 
decibels now let's open an auxiliary
channel<00:04:58.900> and<00:04:59.050> insert<00:04:59.410> and<00:04:59.590> effect

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
channel and insert and effect

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:10.390 
channel and insert and effect
firstly<00:05:02.450> we<00:05:02.810> will<00:05:02.930> insert<00:05:03.230> a<00:05:03.440> reverb<00:05:08.740> and<00:05:09.740> in

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
firstly we will insert a reverb and in

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.980 
firstly we will insert a reverb and in
this<00:05:10.550> case<00:05:10.820> I'm<00:05:11.090> going<00:05:11.270> to<00:05:11.360> use<00:05:11.450> the<00:05:11.750> bright

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
this case I'm going to use the bright

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:24.690 
this case I'm going to use the bright
Hall<00:05:12.200> preset

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:24.700 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.310 

now<00:05:25.700> I'm<00:05:25.970> going<00:05:26.270> to<00:05:26.300> select<00:05:26.630> an<00:05:26.840> input<00:05:27.140> for

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
now I'm going to select an input for

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.150 
now I'm going to select an input for
this<00:05:27.470> reverb

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.370 

I'm<00:05:31.160> quickly<00:05:31.910> going<00:05:32.240> to<00:05:32.390> rename<00:05:32.660> it<00:05:32.720> to<00:05:32.990> be

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
I'm quickly going to rename it to be

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.860 
I'm quickly going to rename it to be
more<00:05:33.560> organized<00:05:34.070> and<00:05:36.970> in<00:05:37.970> the<00:05:38.120> send<00:05:38.360> I<00:05:38.570> will

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
more organized and in the send I will

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:46.810 
more organized and in the send I will
find<00:05:39.110> the<00:05:39.200> name<00:05:39.380> and<00:05:39.650> activate<00:05:45.490> then<00:05:46.490> start

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
find the name and activate then start

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.250 
find the name and activate then start
playing<00:05:47.060> around<00:05:47.210> with<00:05:47.480> the<00:05:47.630> effect<00:05:47.930> on<00:05:48.140> the

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
playing around with the effect on the

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:55.720 
playing around with the effect on the
instrument<00:05:53.380> I'm<00:05:54.380> attempting<00:05:54.800> to<00:05:54.980> distinguish

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:55.730 
instrument I'm attempting to distinguish

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.490 
instrument I'm attempting to distinguish
the<00:05:55.970> changes<00:05:56.360> in<00:05:56.510> reverb<00:05:56.870> but<00:05:56.990> by<00:05:57.110> stopping

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
the changes in reverb but by stopping

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:05.380 
the changes in reverb but by stopping
and<00:05:57.770> playing<00:05:58.430> the<00:05:58.550> track<00:05:58.790> rapidly<00:06:04.090> I'm<00:06:05.090> going

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:05.390 
and playing the track rapidly I'm going

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:06.790 
and playing the track rapidly I'm going
to<00:06:05.480> cut<00:06:05.690> a<00:06:05.720> little<00:06:05.840> more<00:06:06.230> of<00:06:06.320> the<00:06:06.410> mid<00:06:06.590> low

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 
to cut a little more of the mid low

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:20.120 
to cut a little more of the mid low
frequencies

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.130 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.590 

now<00:06:21.130> here's<00:06:21.520> the<00:06:21.670> recording<00:06:22.090> without<00:06:22.420> any

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:22.600 
now here's the recording without any

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:27.780 
now here's the recording without any
processing

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:27.790 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:32.900

I'm<00:06:39.880> going<00:06:40.120> to<00:06:40.240> increase<00:06:40.540> the<00:06:40.690> highs<00:06:40.870> on<00:06:41.140> the

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:41.230 
I'm going to increase the highs on the

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:50.610 
I'm going to increase the highs on the
reverb<00:06:42.510> and<00:06:43.740> raise<00:06:44.740> the<00:06:44.950> cent<00:06:49.350> that's<00:06:50.350> it<00:06:50.470> for

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:50.620 
reverb and raise the cent that's it for

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.260 
reverb and raise the cent that's it for
