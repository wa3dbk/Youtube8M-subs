00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.949
 you one of the most realistic concepts 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:26.730
 expressed opinion in general and through 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:29.010

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.619

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.239

 complicates rotara and to him from no special 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.270
 It is this device that should 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.530
 to convert your life that is perhaps 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.160
 some push notification should 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.440
 come to your and here and now I will 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.700
 show one of the most realistic 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.920
 concepts that are on the Internet they 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.649
 very much the design that is in the concept 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.390
 and he is very very cool thought out then 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.910
 there is just such a cat designer see 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.710
 they are rounded dials and then explain 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.690
 why does it work for you 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.460
 push notification sent you can 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.920
 through a series of answers that is 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.780
 headphones connected to iphone and iphone 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.549
 now watch for some 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.619
 protocol, let's say bluetooth articles 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.810
 audiko dislike as well 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.729
 it will look and through syria you can 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.580
 give a command and you say it there 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.380
 answer on with the s and here it is and that they 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.200
 need to say understand what to fight 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.750
 application type will be embedded 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.270
 alarm clock timer and stopwatch and 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.890
 but I'm not waiting for a review cue and the leaders will be 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.450
 all programs for watches 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.250
 it can also be downloaded tweetbot and 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.560
 view twitter feed why not 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.470
 Also listen to the attention of the application of the SBU 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.900
 which supposedly was in ios 8 should more accurately 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.790
 be at 8 which will keep track of your 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.740
 health, that is, it measures the same pulse 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.079
 count how much you eat how much sleep and 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.570
 in general feeds these are all features that are 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.880
 in anapa b and here's what i expect from him 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.590
 all is not quite as if it is waiting 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.420
 will use and that's what time 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.090
 work iphone last let's say 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.280
 watching the same tape you are a warrior you yourself 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.960
 save battery energy on iphone 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.060
 I certainly understand what is also bluetooth 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.280
 this is also an arco cost agree then 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.950
 what's what instagram tweetbot check 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.729
 And let's say the VKontakte tape will save your 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.920
 ni 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.019
 on iphone the answer to the same with too 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.760
 will save iphone time and in general 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.980
 it comes down to what time it works 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.319
 increases that people plus here's another 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.299
 one interesting concept iwatch output 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.519
 superboy romney, too, he tried very hard 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.930
 unfortunately he does not realize life 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.540
 because make round split 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.519
 hard enough and I calculated what 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.349
 done somehow difficult and yes i know 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.790
 motorola aura thing to match the shower there 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.160
 rectangular display this on 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.569
 rectangular display . just around the edges 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.640
 not active whether it is anyway 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.739
 rectangle spray they circle right there us 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.170
 there are few places and the possibility of a well, 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.510
 round display + battery problems 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.730
 and with components it is also very good and 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.239
 It will not be released until September of October 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.970
 in general in the autumn from the age of 14 if later in the summer 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.980
 he and you, then certainly I Wisnu my 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.410
 thought you understood it is a direct tear 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.390
 Caceres iphone and a long time 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.920
 the work of the iphone itself would also be 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.900
 not bad to do for a long time 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.400
 work fire what have three days new 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.690

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.690
 any innovative ways 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.269
 charging why not and his mosque by chance 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.459
 hill bend shut down the whole team philbin and 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.530
 now nakheel band he seems to be eating a lot 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.510
 software programs there too but 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.440
 since it is no longer let them out 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.299
 stupidly abandoned 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.940

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.480
