00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:26.159
 region 

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:28.939
 even if the manga is gradually being replaced by phones and 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.499

 the economic support of this culture 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.720

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.210

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.420
 by a soft editor in charge of following the mangaka and his team 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.880

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.840
 job 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.940
 in the hours preceding the delivery of the last boards 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.940
 it is not uncommon for the publisher to be at home with a lack of sight 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.610
 last month the diet 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.290
 to the inverted when they start manga but only editors decide his 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.640
