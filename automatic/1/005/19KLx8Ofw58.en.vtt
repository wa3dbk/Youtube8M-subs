00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.040 

all<00:01:54.370> insulation<00:01:55.120> all<00:01:55.240> over<00:01:55.420> the<00:01:55.510> floor<00:01:55.780> here

it's<00:01:57.900> really<00:01:58.980> weird<00:01:59.980> to<00:02:00.400> me<00:02:00.580> seeing<00:02:01.030> a<00:02:01.210> room

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
it's really weird to me seeing a room

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.510 
it's really weird to me seeing a room
that<00:02:01.600> I<00:02:01.690> basically<00:02:02.020> grew<00:02:02.470> up<00:02:02.710> in<00:02:02.980> torn<00:02:03.370> apart

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
that I basically grew up in torn apart

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.930 
that I basically grew up in torn apart
to<00:02:03.850> this<00:02:03.970> level<00:02:08.130> okay<00:02:09.130> I<00:02:09.369> guess<00:02:09.580> the<00:02:09.670> door<00:02:09.820> to

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
to this level okay I guess the door to

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.300 
to this level okay I guess the door to
suck<00:02:10.149> itself<00:02:10.480> closed<00:02:10.750> but<00:02:11.440> anyway<00:02:14.160> it's<00:02:15.160> got<00:02:15.250> a

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
suck itself closed but anyway it's got a

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.890 
suck itself closed but anyway it's got a
little<00:02:15.520> bit<00:02:15.640> hazardous<00:02:15.910> walking<00:02:16.540> around<00:02:16.780> in

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
little bit hazardous walking around in

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:17.940 
little bit hazardous walking around in
there<00:02:16.990> and<00:02:17.080> I<00:02:17.110> think<00:02:17.200> that's<00:02:17.320> like<00:02:17.440> exposed

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
there and I think that's like exposed

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:26.970 
there and I think that's like exposed
wiring<00:02:18.310> everywhere<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:26.380> view<00:02:26.590> from<00:02:26.740> the<00:02:26.830> back

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
wiring everywhere the view from the back

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.260 
wiring everywhere the view from the back
you<00:02:27.130> could<00:02:27.220> see<00:02:27.370> that<00:02:27.490> wall<00:02:27.790> in<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.030> middle

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
you could see that wall in the middle

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.140 
you could see that wall in the middle
there<00:02:28.450> it's<00:02:28.600> completely<00:02:28.750> gone<00:02:29.620> now
