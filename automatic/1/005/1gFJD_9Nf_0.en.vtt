00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:09.910 
extensions I'm going to show you how to

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.350 
extensions I'm going to show you how to
braid<00:00:10.910> in<00:00:11.360> the<00:00:11.750> hair<00:00:12.080> extensions<00:00:13.120> one<00:00:14.120> thing

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360 
braid in the hair extensions one thing

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.140 
braid in the hair extensions one thing
to<00:00:14.599> keep<00:00:14.750> in<00:00:14.960> mind<00:00:15.259> is<00:00:15.500> to<00:00:15.530> have<00:00:15.769> a<00:00:15.800> chair<00:00:16.250> like

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
to keep in mind is to have a chair like

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.840 
to keep in mind is to have a chair like
this<00:00:17.210> so<00:00:17.840> when<00:00:17.990> you<00:00:18.110> divide<00:00:18.529> the<00:00:18.890> hair<00:00:19.099> and<00:00:19.699> you

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
this so when you divide the hair and you

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.810 
this so when you divide the hair and you
pull<00:00:20.060> it<00:00:20.150> out<00:00:20.270> of<00:00:20.300> the<00:00:20.449> package<00:00:21.820> you're

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
pull it out of the package you're

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.730 
pull it out of the package you're
careful<00:00:23.150> that<00:00:23.630> you<00:00:23.720> have<00:00:23.900> a<00:00:23.930> chair<00:00:24.289> to<00:00:24.439> put<00:00:24.619> it

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
careful that you have a chair to put it

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.429 
careful that you have a chair to put it
over<00:00:25.039> so<00:00:25.850> that<00:00:25.880> it<00:00:26.150> doesn't<00:00:26.539> get<00:00:26.660> bunched<00:00:27.260> up

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
over so that it doesn't get bunched up

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.370 
over so that it doesn't get bunched up
so<00:00:27.830> it<00:00:28.490> comes<00:00:28.760> in<00:00:29.090> a<00:00:29.180> package<00:00:29.720> like<00:00:29.750> this<00:00:30.050> and

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
so it comes in a package like this and

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
so it comes in a package like this and
we<00:00:31.189> just<00:00:31.220> separate<00:00:32.119> it<00:00:32.419> and<00:00:32.720> then<00:00:33.350> slide<00:00:34.160> it

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:34.400 
we just separate it and then slide it

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.690 
we just separate it and then slide it
over<00:00:34.640> the<00:00:35.140> chair<00:00:36.140> and<00:00:36.890> I've<00:00:37.250> already<00:00:37.399> done

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
over the chair and I've already done

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.590 
over the chair and I've already done
that<00:00:37.940> with<00:00:38.270> this<00:00:38.570> hair<00:00:39.040> this<00:00:40.040> is<00:00:40.250> 16<00:00:40.820> inch<00:00:41.059> hair

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
that with this hair this is 16 inch hair

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.340 
that with this hair this is 16 inch hair
and<00:00:41.930> her<00:00:42.680> hair<00:00:42.710> we've<00:00:43.190> used<00:00:44.170> actually<00:00:45.170> about

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
and her hair we've used actually about

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.490 
and her hair we've used actually about
two<00:00:45.739> and<00:00:45.890> a<00:00:45.950> half<00:00:45.980> packages<00:00:46.940> and<00:00:47.420> it<00:00:48.289> just

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
two and a half packages and it just

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.200 
two and a half packages and it just
depends<00:00:48.829> on<00:00:49.129> you<00:00:49.370> know<00:00:49.460> how<00:00:49.640> much<00:00:49.789> hair<00:00:50.030> you

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
depends on you know how much hair you

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.479 
depends on you know how much hair you
want<00:00:50.329> to<00:00:50.450> braid<00:00:50.690> in<00:00:50.960> so<00:00:51.710> I've<00:00:51.890> already<00:00:52.070> done

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
want to braid in so I've already done

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.560 
want to braid in so I've already done
most<00:00:52.700> of<00:00:53.000> it<00:00:53.270> and<00:00:53.600> then<00:00:54.020> they<00:00:54.200> just<00:00:54.829> basically

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
most of it and then they just basically

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.770 
most of it and then they just basically
divided<00:00:56.570> it<00:00:56.719> out<00:00:56.899> and<00:00:57.350> then<00:00:57.559> taking<00:00:58.780> specific

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
divided it out and then taking specific

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.220 
divided it out and then taking specific
small<00:01:00.440> little<00:01:00.890> sections<00:01:01.489> and<00:01:01.910> I<00:01:02.600> don't<00:01:02.960> do

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
small little sections and I don't do

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.279 
small little sections and I don't do
this<00:01:03.379> in<00:01:03.649> a<00:01:03.770> straight<00:01:04.190> line<00:01:05.259> every<00:01:06.259> time

00:01:06.279 --> 00:01:06.289 
this in a straight line every time

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:10.960 
this in a straight line every time
because<00:01:07.039> as<00:01:07.760> you<00:01:08.740> divide<00:01:09.740> and<00:01:10.070> part<00:01:10.400> it<00:01:10.610> if<00:01:10.820> you

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
because as you divide and part it if you

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.120 
because as you divide and part it if you
part<00:01:11.299> it<00:01:11.420> in<00:01:11.540> the<00:01:11.570> same<00:01:11.960> area<00:01:12.409> all<00:01:12.680> the<00:01:12.860> time

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
part it in the same area all the time

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.760 
part it in the same area all the time
the<00:01:13.340> hair<00:01:13.580> can<00:01:13.850> begin<00:01:14.119> to<00:01:14.330> break<00:01:15.049> off<00:01:15.320> so<00:01:15.710> you

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
the hair can begin to break off so you

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.700 
the hair can begin to break off so you
want<00:01:15.920> to<00:01:16.159> kind<00:01:16.340> of<00:01:16.750> alternate<00:01:17.750> how<00:01:18.439> you're

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
want to kind of alternate how you're

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.490 
want to kind of alternate how you're
dividing<00:01:19.009> it<00:01:19.490> and<00:01:19.790> so<00:01:20.240> this<00:01:20.570> time<00:01:20.930> I<00:01:21.140> just<00:01:21.170> kind

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
dividing it and so this time I just kind

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.490 
dividing it and so this time I just kind
of<00:01:21.680> randomly<00:01:22.340> divided<00:01:22.939> I<00:01:23.210> put<00:01:23.540> it<00:01:23.659> into<00:01:23.960> four

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
of randomly divided I put it into four

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.039 
of randomly divided I put it into four
sections<00:01:24.799> and<00:01:25.250> then<00:01:25.430> each<00:01:25.580> section<00:01:26.090> I<00:01:26.240> started

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
sections and then each section I started

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.109 
sections and then each section I started
to<00:01:27.259> divide<00:01:27.530> out<00:01:27.830> you<00:01:28.130> can<00:01:28.310> kind<00:01:28.580> of<00:01:28.640> see<00:01:28.880> how

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
to divide out you can kind of see how

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.670 
to divide out you can kind of see how
it's<00:01:29.590> kind<00:01:30.590> of<00:01:31.420> divided<00:01:32.420> some<00:01:32.659> of<00:01:32.810> them<00:01:32.960> are<00:01:33.110> in

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
it's kind of divided some of them are in

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.350 
it's kind of divided some of them are in
triangles<00:01:34.490> and<00:01:34.729> some<00:01:34.909> of<00:01:35.030> them<00:01:35.119> are<00:01:35.299> in

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
triangles and some of them are in

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.530 
triangles and some of them are in
squares<00:01:35.720> and<00:01:36.020> I<00:01:36.110> wanted<00:01:36.950> it<00:01:37.070> that<00:01:37.130> way<00:01:37.540> on

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
squares and I wanted it that way on

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.210 
squares and I wanted it that way on
purpose<00:01:38.619> so<00:01:39.619> here<00:01:39.920> we<00:01:40.070> take<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:40.549> hair<00:01:41.170> and

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
purpose so here we take the hair and

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.609 
purpose so here we take the hair and

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
brushed it out and then I would put in

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.480 
brushed it out and then I would put in
some<00:01:49.159> sort<00:01:49.430> of<00:01:49.579> like<00:01:50.000> conditioning<00:01:50.689> cream<00:01:51.490> to

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
have three sections that we can start to

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.520 
have three sections that we can start to
braid<00:02:19.070> so<00:02:19.910> we<00:02:20.090> just<00:02:20.300> braid<00:02:20.900> it<00:02:20.930> and<00:02:21.410> the

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
braid so we just braid it and the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.200 
braid so we just braid it and the
hardest<00:02:21.890> part<00:02:21.980> is<00:02:22.250> just<00:02:22.430> getting<00:02:22.550> it<00:02:22.910> started

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
hardest part is just getting it started

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.960 
hardest part is just getting it started
tight<00:02:23.750> we<00:02:24.560> want<00:02:24.800> it<00:02:24.890> to<00:02:25.070> start<00:02:25.400> tight<00:02:25.700> but<00:02:25.940> not

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
tight we want it to start tight but not

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.470 
tight we want it to start tight but not
tight<00:02:26.420> enough<00:02:26.540> that<00:02:26.960> little<00:02:28.180> bubbles

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
tight enough that little bubbles

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.540 
tight enough that little bubbles
pull<00:02:29.930> up<00:02:30.110> on<00:02:30.260> there<00:02:30.470> there<00:02:30.740> when<00:02:30.950> you<00:02:31.040> see<00:02:31.310> kids

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
pull up on there there when you see kids

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.760 
pull up on there there when you see kids
and<00:02:31.820> if<00:02:31.940> they<00:02:32.120> have<00:02:32.300> it's<00:02:32.990> too<00:02:33.260> tight<00:02:33.560> you

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
and if they have it's too tight you

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.240 
and if they have it's too tight you
might<00:02:33.890> get<00:02:34.130> a<00:02:34.160> little<00:02:34.630> it<00:02:35.630> might<00:02:35.800> get<00:02:36.800> kind<00:02:37.130> of

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
might get a little it might get kind of

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.720 
might get a little it might get kind of
sore<00:02:37.730> so<00:02:38.540> we<00:02:38.720> want<00:02:38.930> to<00:02:39.080> hold<00:02:39.380> it<00:02:39.590> firm<00:02:40.310> but<00:02:40.700> not

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
sore so we want to hold it firm but not

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.350 
sore so we want to hold it firm but not
so<00:02:41.450> tight<00:02:41.720> that<00:02:41.960> it's<00:02:42.140> painful<00:02:42.850> I'm<00:02:43.850> going<00:02:44.180> to

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
so tight that it's painful I'm going to

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.080 
so tight that it's painful I'm going to
sprayed<00:02:44.750> and<00:02:45.710> I<00:02:45.800> braid<00:02:46.040> it<00:02:46.190> down<00:02:46.400> about<00:02:46.640> three

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
sprayed and I braid it down about three

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.800 
sprayed and I braid it down about three
or<00:02:47.180> four<00:02:47.420> times<00:02:47.660> and<00:02:48.200> then<00:02:49.190> I<00:02:49.450> separated<00:02:50.450> so

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
or four times and then I separated so

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.550 
or four times and then I separated so
here's<00:02:51.110> her<00:02:51.350> hair<00:02:51.710> and<00:02:52.010> here's<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:52.940> two<00:02:53.560> of

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
here's her hair and here's the two of

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.380 
here's her hair and here's the two of
the<00:02:55.310> synthetic<00:02:56.060> hair<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:56.630> I'm<00:02:57.110> going<00:02:57.320> to<00:02:57.350> add

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
the synthetic hair and I'm going to add

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.710 
the synthetic hair and I'm going to add
and<00:02:59.390> divide<00:02:59.840> this<00:03:00.440> and<00:03:00.860> add<00:03:01.250> some<00:03:01.640> of<00:03:01.790> her<00:03:02.660> hair

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
and divide this and add some of her hair

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.490 
and divide this and add some of her hair
to<00:03:03.170> it<00:03:03.320> some<00:03:03.620> that<00:03:03.830> now<00:03:04.070> we<00:03:04.130> have<00:03:05.500> three

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
to it some that now we have three

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:13.230 
to it some that now we have three
sections<00:03:06.920> of<00:03:07.460> hair<00:03:09.010> basically<00:03:10.660> so<00:03:11.660> we<00:03:11.840> have

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
sections of hair basically so we have

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.100 
sections of hair basically so we have
her<00:03:14.240> hair<00:03:14.570> divided<00:03:15.200> into<00:03:16.240> the<00:03:17.240> sections<00:03:17.840> and

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
her hair divided into the sections and

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
her hair divided into the sections and
now<00:03:18.230> we're<00:03:18.470> braiding<00:03:19.420> with<00:03:20.420> three<00:03:21.130> sections

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
now we're braiding with three sections

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.530 
now we're braiding with three sections
of<00:03:22.640> the<00:03:23.480> synthetic<00:03:24.080> hair<00:03:24.110> along<00:03:24.860> with<00:03:25.420> part<00:03:26.420> of

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
of the synthetic hair along with part of

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.200 
of the synthetic hair along with part of
her<00:03:26.720> hair<00:03:27.020> and<00:03:27.590> I<00:03:27.740> would<00:03:27.950> just<00:03:28.160> divide<00:03:28.430> it<00:03:28.940> and

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.210 
her hair and I would just divide it and

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.350 
her hair and I would just divide it and
braid<00:03:29.540> it<00:03:29.780> all<00:03:29.900> the<00:03:30.020> way<00:03:30.880> until<00:03:31.880> you<00:03:31.940> get<00:03:32.300> to

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
braid it all the way until you get to

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:40.090 
braid it all the way until you get to
the<00:03:32.720> end<00:03:32.870> of<00:03:33.020> her<00:03:33.140> hair<00:03:38.560> you<00:03:39.560> want<00:03:39.740> to<00:03:39.830> kind<00:03:39.980> of

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
the end of her hair you want to kind of

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.830 
the end of her hair you want to kind of
pull<00:03:40.670> through<00:03:41.120> otherwise<00:03:41.870> it<00:03:42.110> gets<00:03:42.820> knotted

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
pull through otherwise it gets knotted

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.720 
pull through otherwise it gets knotted
at<00:03:44.840> the<00:03:45.080> end<00:03:45.260> if<00:03:45.709> you<00:03:45.740> braid<00:03:46.160> it<00:03:46.370> and<00:03:46.400> don't

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
at the end if you braid it and don't

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:54.380 
at the end if you braid it and don't
pull<00:03:47.030> it<00:03:47.209> through<00:03:47.570> every<00:03:47.870> couple<00:03:48.290> of<00:03:48.350> times

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:16.009 

and<00:03:54.540> then<00:03:54.990> I<00:03:55.790> just<00:03:56.790> take<00:03:57.090> a

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.780

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
you can just try it to trim it you can

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.740 
you can just try it to trim it you can
wash<00:04:34.780> it<00:04:35.050> this<00:04:35.260> way<00:04:35.560> I<00:04:36.100> just<00:04:36.850> be<00:04:37.210> careful<00:04:37.720> to
