the ones that easily come out this one's
a<00:02:30.750> little<00:02:30.870> bit<00:02:31.050> harder<00:02:31.320> of<00:02:31.350> course<00:02:31.440> this<00:02:32.100> is<00:02:32.250> a

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
a little bit harder of course this is a

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.950 
a little bit harder of course this is a
budget<00:02:32.520> case<00:02:32.880> so<00:02:33.300> you're<00:02:33.510> not<00:02:33.600> going<00:02:33.750> to<00:02:33.810> have

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
budget case so you're not going to have

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.260 
budget case so you're not going to have
all<00:02:34.170> of<00:02:34.230> those<00:02:34.530> features<00:02:34.820> I've<00:02:35.820> gone<00:02:36.090> ahead

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
all of those features I've gone ahead

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.110 
all of those features I've gone ahead
and<00:02:36.660> remove<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.800> side<00:02:38.010> panel<00:02:38.040> here<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:38.820> i

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
and remove the side panel here and i

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.670 
and remove the side panel here and i
want<00:02:39.210> to<00:02:39.300> show<00:02:39.360> you<00:02:39.450> there<00:02:39.660> is<00:02:39.690> foam<00:02:40.290> on<00:02:40.530> the

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
want to show you there is foam on the

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.900 
want to show you there is foam on the
side<00:02:40.860> panel<00:02:41.130> this<00:02:41.190> is<00:02:41.340> sound<00:02:41.610> dampening

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
side panel this is sound dampening

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.670 
side panel this is sound dampening
material<00:02:42.060> now<00:02:42.810> one<00:02:43.050> thing<00:02:43.080> I<00:02:43.290> can<00:02:43.440> notice

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
material now one thing I can notice

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.040 
material now one thing I can notice
about<00:02:43.860> it<00:02:44.040> right<00:02:44.220> away<00:02:44.250> it<00:02:44.730> is<00:02:45.270> not<00:02:45.600> overly

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
about it right away it is not overly

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.830 
about it right away it is not overly
thick<00:02:46.350> and<00:02:46.590> it's<00:02:46.680> not<00:02:46.860> really<00:02:47.850> dense<00:02:48.150> like<00:02:48.690> we

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
thick and it's not really dense like we

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.720 
thick and it's not really dense like we
see<00:02:49.020> on<00:02:49.050> a<00:02:49.140> lot<00:02:49.350> of<00:02:49.500> other<00:02:49.709> cases<00:02:49.950> who<00:02:50.280> just

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
see on a lot of other cases who just

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.310 
see on a lot of other cases who just
going<00:02:50.850> to<00:02:50.940> have<00:02:51.060> to<00:02:51.090> see<00:02:51.450> as<00:02:51.720> we<00:02:51.959> you<00:02:52.080> know<00:02:52.200> get

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
going to have to see as we you know get

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.350 
going to have to see as we you know get
our<00:02:52.620> system<00:02:52.980> installed<00:02:53.310> how<00:02:53.850> well<00:02:54.150> this

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
our system installed how well this

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.990 
our system installed how well this
actually<00:02:54.600> dampens<00:02:55.260> your<00:02:55.320> sound<00:02:55.820> now<00:02:56.820> if<00:02:56.910> we

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
actually dampens your sound now if we

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.699 
actually dampens your sound now if we
get<00:02:57.150> this<00:02:57.300> out<00:02:57.480> of<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.600> way<00:02:57.660> we<00:02:58.050> can<00:02:58.200> actually

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
get this out of the way we can actually

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.940 
get this out of the way we can actually
see<00:02:59.240> everything<00:03:00.240> that<00:03:00.810> is<00:03:01.110> inside<00:03:01.500> of<00:03:01.830> our

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
again we get that out of the way and we

again we get that out of the way and we
can<00:04:09.540> take<00:04:09.810> a<00:04:09.840> look<00:04:10.019> at<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:10.380> back<00:04:10.560> of<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.799> case

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
can take a look at the back of the case

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:11.930 
can take a look at the back of the case
and<00:04:11.130> this<00:04:11.220> is<00:04:11.340> going<00:04:11.459> to<00:04:11.519> show<00:04:11.670> you<00:04:11.760> how

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
and this is going to show you how

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.600 
and this is going to show you how
everything<00:04:12.900> is<00:04:13.140> set<00:04:13.799> up<00:04:13.830> here<00:04:14.190> we<00:04:14.280> can<00:04:14.400> see<00:04:14.519> our

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
everything is set up here we can see our

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.490 
everything is set up here we can see our
large<00:04:14.790> CPU<00:04:15.180> cut<00:04:15.360> out<00:04:15.480> all<00:04:15.690> of<00:04:15.900> our<00:04:16.290> routing

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
large CPU cut out all of our routing

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.080 
large CPU cut out all of our routing
holes<00:04:16.799> now<00:04:16.979> remember<00:04:17.549> the<00:04:17.640> trays<00:04:17.880> that<00:04:17.910> I

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
holes now remember the trays that I

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.520 
holes now remember the trays that I
talked<00:04:18.330> about<00:04:18.419> they<00:04:18.630> do<00:04:18.690> come<00:04:18.989> out<00:04:19.109> on<00:04:19.290> this

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
talked about they do come out on this

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.520 
talked about they do come out on this
side<00:04:19.739> of<00:04:19.859> the<00:04:19.919> case<00:04:20.100> so<00:04:20.970> we<00:04:21.510> can<00:04:21.840> take<00:04:22.320> those

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
side of the case so we can take those

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.460 
side of the case so we can take those
out<00:04:22.740> and<00:04:23.039> I'm<00:04:24.000> sure<00:04:24.240> you<00:04:24.360> guys<00:04:24.479> can<00:04:24.539> see<00:04:25.020> that

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
out and I'm sure you guys can see that

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.720 
out and I'm sure you guys can see that
they<00:04:25.620> support<00:04:25.979> two<00:04:26.099> and<00:04:26.220> a<00:04:26.250> half

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
they support two and a half

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.190 
they support two and a half
and<00:04:26.970> three<00:04:27.330> and<00:04:27.420> a<00:04:27.480> half<00:04:27.510> inch<00:04:27.870> hard<00:04:28.140> drive

three and a half inch hard drive

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.460 
three and a half inch hard drive
installation<00:04:30.090> will<00:04:30.540> be<00:04:30.660> completely<00:04:31.050> to<00:04:31.260> lyst

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
installation will be completely to lyst

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.980 
installation will be completely to lyst
with<00:04:31.980> a<00:04:32.010> little<00:04:32.250> pegs<00:04:32.520> that<00:04:32.820> are<00:04:33.000> on<00:04:33.360> here<00:04:33.390> and

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
with a little pegs that are on here and

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.900 
with a little pegs that are on here and
of<00:04:34.170> course<00:04:34.200> these<00:04:35.010> easily<00:04:35.570> should<00:04:36.950> go<00:04:37.950> if<00:04:38.790> I

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
of course these easily should go if I

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.640 
of course these easily should go if I
can<00:04:39.210> line<00:04:39.540> it<00:04:39.570> up<00:04:39.720> correctly<00:04:39.930> go<00:04:40.260> right<00:04:40.470> back

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
can line it up correctly go right back

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.610 
can line it up correctly go right back
in<00:04:40.890> there<00:04:41.100> just<00:04:41.670> like<00:04:41.790> that<00:04:41.850> really<00:04:42.330> easy<00:04:42.660> it

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
in there just like that really easy it

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.910 
in there just like that really easy it
looks<00:04:43.920> like<00:04:44.190> the<00:04:44.820> top<00:04:45.270> hard<00:04:46.260> drive<00:04:46.440> cage<00:04:46.650> can

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:46.920 
looks like the top hard drive cage can

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.530 
looks like the top hard drive cage can
also<00:04:47.040> be<00:04:47.250> removed<00:04:47.580> I<00:04:47.850> might<00:04:48.000> do<00:04:48.150> see<00:04:48.300> the<00:04:48.390> two

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
also be removed I might do see the two

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.330 
also be removed I might do see the two
screws<00:04:48.780> here<00:04:49.020> so<00:04:49.470> that<00:04:49.590> should<00:04:49.770> just<00:04:49.950> pull<00:04:50.130> out

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
screws here so that should just pull out
