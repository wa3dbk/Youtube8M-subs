00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
lot of factors that go into putting a

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.740 
lot of factors that go into putting a
bedroom<00:01:52.100> together<00:01:52.460> and<00:01:52.760> making<00:01:53.150> it<00:01:53.390> look<00:01:53.540> good

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
bedroom together and making it look good

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.800 
bedroom together and making it look good
so<00:01:54.140> if<00:01:54.530> you<00:01:55.159> segment<00:01:55.490> it<00:01:55.820> out<00:01:55.940> it<00:01:56.180> makes<00:01:56.630> it

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
so if you segment it out it makes it

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.020 
so if you segment it out it makes it
easier<00:01:57.200> to<00:01:57.440> approach<00:01:57.799> and<00:01:58.190> it<00:01:58.369> makes<00:01:58.580> you<00:01:58.790> kind

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
easier to approach and it makes you kind

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.850 
easier to approach and it makes you kind
of<00:01:59.090> step<00:01:59.330> back<00:01:59.510> and<00:01:59.750> think<00:01:59.990> about<00:02:00.049> each<00:02:00.470> piece

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
of step back and think about each piece

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.370 
of step back and think about each piece
