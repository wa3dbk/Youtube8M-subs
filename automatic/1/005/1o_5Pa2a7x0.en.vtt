where portion control is of the utmost
importance<00:00:45.930> as<00:00:46.110> I've<00:00:46.829> said<00:00:46.980> many<00:00:47.039> times

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
importance as I've said many times

your body composition then it really

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.709

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
then you're not going to lose any body

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.950 
then you're not going to lose any body
fat<00:01:13.770> at<00:01:13.950> all<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.369> if<00:01:14.880> you're<00:01:15.030> aiming<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.630> bulk

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
fat at all and if you're aiming to bulk

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.530 
fat at all and if you're aiming to bulk
up<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.439> your<00:01:17.070> net<00:01:17.310> calorie<00:01:17.670> surplus<00:01:17.970> shoots

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
up and your net calorie surplus shoots

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.359 
up and your net calorie surplus shoots
too<00:01:18.720> high<00:01:18.900> again<00:01:19.229> 15<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.710> 20%<00:01:20.070> above

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.100 
too high again 15 to 20% above
maintenance<00:01:21.119> would<00:01:21.240> be<00:01:21.360> my<00:01:21.479> recommendation

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
maintenance would be my recommendation

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.660 
maintenance would be my recommendation
there<00:01:22.290> you're<00:01:22.830> still<00:01:23.009> going<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.220> gain<00:01:23.400> muscle
