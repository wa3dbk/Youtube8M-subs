deficiencies<00:02:48.230> or<00:02:48.620> not<00:02:48.890> is<00:02:49.100> another<00:02:49.310> way

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
deficiencies or not is another way

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.250 
deficiencies or not is another way
there's<00:02:50.090> so<00:02:50.330> many<00:02:50.420> different<00:02:50.870> ways<00:02:51.019> and

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
there's so many different ways and

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.740 
there's so many different ways and
that's<00:02:51.410> what<00:02:51.560> I<00:02:51.590> teach<00:02:51.890> is<00:02:52.150> make<00:02:53.150> sure<00:02:53.480> what

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
that's what I teach is make sure what

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.300 
that's what I teach is make sure what
you're<00:02:53.900> doing<00:02:54.260> is<00:02:54.410> working<00:02:54.680> for<00:02:55.010> you<00:02:55.130> and

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
forget about what everyone else is

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.539 
forget about what everyone else is
saying<00:02:56.690> don't<00:02:57.380> follow<00:02:57.920> the<00:02:58.160> leader<00:02:58.400> and

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
saying don't follow the leader and

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.370 
saying don't follow the leader and
because<00:02:59.120> the<00:02:59.269> leader<00:02:59.480> might<00:02:59.810> be<00:02:59.989> doing<00:03:00.260> what

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
because the leader might be doing what

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.660 
because the leader might be doing what
works<00:03:00.560> best<00:03:00.769> for<00:03:00.860> them<00:03:01.100> but<00:03:01.310> but<00:03:01.400> something

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
works best for them but but something

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.120 
works best for them but but something
else<00:03:01.790> might<00:03:02.030> be<00:03:02.180> best<00:03:02.420> for<00:03:02.630> you<00:03:02.780> is<00:03:03.709> the<00:03:03.950> raw

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
else might be best for you is the raw

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.890

vegan<00:03:04.610> diet<00:03:04.640> best<00:03:05.090> for<00:03:05.299> all<00:03:05.390> of<00:03:05.540> us<00:03:05.660> I<00:03:05.840> think

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
vegan diet best for all of us I think

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.560 
vegan diet best for all of us I think
it's<00:03:06.440> the<00:03:06.680> most<00:03:07.160> cleansing<00:03:07.519> I<00:03:08.000> think<00:03:08.299> it<00:03:08.420> has

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
it's the most cleansing I think it has

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.300 
it's the most cleansing I think it has
the<00:03:08.720> most<00:03:08.930> nutrients<00:03:09.530> I<00:03:09.709> think<00:03:09.950> that<00:03:10.070> are<00:03:10.160> most

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
the most nutrients I think that are most

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.509 
the most nutrients I think that are most
easily<00:03:10.519> digested<00:03:11.450> and<00:03:11.660> I<00:03:12.079> think<00:03:12.410> we<00:03:13.340> can

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
easily digested and I think we can

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.880 
easily digested and I think we can
thrive<00:03:13.790> on<00:03:14.060> it<00:03:14.230> however<00:03:15.230> there<00:03:15.590> are<00:03:15.709> some

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
thrive on it however there are some

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.460 
thrive on it however there are some
people<00:03:16.280> in<00:03:16.310> certain<00:03:16.609> situations<00:03:17.470> emotionally

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
people in certain situations emotionally

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.370 
people in certain situations emotionally
mentally<00:03:19.209> lack<00:03:20.209> of<00:03:20.420> knowledge<00:03:20.870> and<00:03:21.079> all<00:03:21.230> these

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
mentally lack of knowledge and all these

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.319 
mentally lack of knowledge and all these
other<00:03:21.590> reasons<00:03:21.829> they<00:03:22.310> will<00:03:22.519> not<00:03:22.700> thrive<00:03:23.060> on<00:03:23.299> a

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
other reasons they will not thrive on a
