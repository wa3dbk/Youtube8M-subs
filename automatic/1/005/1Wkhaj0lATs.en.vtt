pressure<00:01:43.530> for<00:01:43.799> my<00:01:43.890> airplane<00:01:44.539> your<00:01:45.539> service

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
pressure for my airplane your service

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.510 
pressure for my airplane your service
and<00:01:46.229> maintenance<00:01:46.380> section<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:46.799> your<00:01:46.859> poh<00:01:47.249> or

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
and maintenance section of your poh or

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.190 
and maintenance section of your poh or
your<00:01:47.759> aircraft<00:01:48.270> maintenance<00:01:48.539> manual<00:01:49.049> should

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
your aircraft maintenance manual should

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.719 
your aircraft maintenance manual should
answer<00:01:49.469> that<00:01:49.590> question<00:01:49.890> for<00:01:50.039> you<00:01:50.219> okay<00:01:50.670> so

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
answer that question for you okay so

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.899 
answer that question for you okay so
what's<00:01:51.420> in<00:01:51.569> flying<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.899> Cessna<00:01:52.259> 182<00:01:52.710> s<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.520> the

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
what's in flying a Cessna 182 s and the

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.599 
what's in flying a Cessna 182 s and the
poh<00:01:54.359> says<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.740> tire<00:01:55.979> pressure<00:01:56.280> should

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:56.609 
poh says that the tire pressure should

00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:01.069 
poh says that the tire pressure should
be<00:01:56.640> 42<00:01:57.359> psi<00:01:57.630> so<00:01:58.560> can<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.829> use<00:01:58.859> between<00:01:59.340> 42<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.359> 44

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
be 42 psi so can I use between 42 and 44

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.149 
be 42 psi so can I use between 42 and 44
psi<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:02.310> acceptable<00:02:02.990> correct<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:05.100> other

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
psi is that acceptable correct the other

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.039 
psi is that acceptable correct the other
thing<00:02:05.429> with<00:02:05.549> that<00:02:05.579> is<00:02:05.729> whether<00:02:06.389> it<00:02:06.630> recommends

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
thing with that is whether it recommends

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.359 
thing with that is whether it recommends
that<00:02:07.170> pressure<00:02:07.409> at<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.770> loaded<00:02:08.160> or<00:02:08.340> unloaded

that pressure at a loaded or unloaded

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.700 
that pressure at a loaded or unloaded
condition<00:02:09.179> if<00:02:09.630> it<00:02:09.840> recommends<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.380> in<00:02:10.560> an

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
condition if it recommends it in an

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.220 
condition if it recommends it in an

well<00:02:21.450> again<00:02:21.720> two<00:02:22.019> things<00:02:22.230> for<00:02:22.409> that<00:02:22.530> first<00:02:23.340> of

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
well again two things for that first of

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.460 
well again two things for that first of
all<00:02:23.549> use<00:02:23.730> a<00:02:23.760> digital<00:02:24.030> or<00:02:24.810> around<00:02:25.170> aisle

all use a digital or around aisle
aviation<00:02:26.340> tire<00:02:26.970> pressure<00:02:27.269> gauge<00:02:27.799> and<00:02:28.799> make

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
aviation tire pressure gauge and make

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.559 
aviation tire pressure gauge and make
sure<00:02:29.190> that<00:02:29.310> you're<00:02:29.459> not<00:02:29.549> using<00:02:29.790> one<00:02:29.970> that<00:02:30.450> goes

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
sure that you're not using one that goes

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.110 
sure that you're not using one that goes
to<00:02:30.599> 300<00:02:31.140> psi<00:02:31.470> if<00:02:31.769> your<00:02:32.099> tires<00:02:32.340> are<00:02:32.610> in<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.819> 50

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
to 300 psi if your tires are in the 50

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.720 
to 300 psi if your tires are in the 50
psi<00:02:33.480> area<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:34.560> how<00:02:34.739> often<00:02:35.069> should<00:02:35.220> I<00:02:35.340> check<00:02:35.519> my

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
psi area and how often should I check my

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.610 
psi area and how often should I check my
tire<00:02:35.910> pressure<00:02:36.209> well<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:37.200> should<00:02:37.349> check<00:02:37.379> your

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
tire pressure well you should check your

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.039 
tire pressure well you should check your
tire<00:02:37.769> pressure<00:02:38.150> daily<00:02:39.150> or<00:02:39.360> before<00:02:39.900> each

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
tire pressure daily or before each

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.360 
tire pressure daily or before each
flight<00:02:40.290> you<00:02:40.590> really<00:02:40.830> should<00:02:40.980> check<00:02:41.010> it<00:02:41.250> before

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
flight you really should check it before

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.160 
flight you really should check it before
in<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.760> first<00:02:42.000> flight<00:02:42.269> so<00:02:42.599> your<00:02:42.720> tires<00:02:42.930> are

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
in the first flight so your tires are

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.630 
in the first flight so your tires are
cold<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.829> gives<00:02:44.010> you<00:02:44.129> a<00:02:44.160> good<00:02:44.370> proper

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
cold and it gives you a good proper

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.880 
cold and it gives you a good proper
reading<00:02:44.819> and<00:02:45.269> what<00:02:45.810> about<00:02:46.049> what<00:02:46.290> we<00:02:46.440> put<00:02:46.470> in

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
reading and what about what we put in

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.190 
reading and what about what we put in
the<00:02:47.099> tires<00:02:47.370> is<00:02:47.849> nitrogen<00:02:48.450> better<00:02:48.810> than<00:02:49.049> air

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
the tires is nitrogen better than air

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.589 
the tires is nitrogen better than air
nitrogen<00:02:50.069> is<00:02:50.340> better<00:02:50.670> than<00:02:50.879> air<00:02:51.030> in<00:02:51.269> certain

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
nitrogen is better than air in certain

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.600 
nitrogen is better than air in certain
circumstances<00:02:52.370> generally<00:02:53.370> when<00:02:53.489> you're

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
circumstances generally when you're

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.610 
circumstances generally when you're
using<00:02:53.819> a<00:02:54.150> tubeless<00:02:54.480> tire<00:02:54.780> it'll<00:02:55.379> reduce

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
using a tubeless tire it'll reduce

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.440 
using a tubeless tire it'll reduce
corrosion<00:02:55.950> on<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.310> wheel<00:02:56.459> if<00:02:57.090> you're<00:02:57.299> using

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
using nitrogen you should continue to

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.770 
using nitrogen you should continue to
use<00:03:04.349> nitrogen<00:03:04.859> to<00:03:05.160> maximize<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.790> benefit<00:03:06.150> now

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
the time as a flight instructor you

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.910 
the time as a flight instructor you
probably<00:03:09.959> remember<00:03:10.440> this<00:03:10.560> from<00:03:10.769> your

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
probably remember this from your

probably remember this from your
instructing<00:03:11.430> days<00:03:11.640> you<00:03:12.120> know<00:03:12.209> how<00:03:12.299> students

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
instructing days you know how students

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.839 
instructing days you know how students
are<00:03:12.780> really<00:03:12.930> hard<00:03:13.170> on<00:03:13.290> tires

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 
are really hard on tires

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.460 
are really hard on tires
sometimes<00:03:14.849> I'm<00:03:15.030> told<00:03:15.269> well<00:03:15.480> it's<00:03:15.660> okay<00:03:16.079> if

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
sometimes I'm told well it's okay if

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.930 
sometimes I'm told well it's okay if
there's<00:03:16.709> some<00:03:16.859> cords<00:03:17.250> or<00:03:17.400> little<00:03:17.670> fabric

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
there's some cords or little fabric

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.050 
there's some cords or little fabric
showing<00:03:18.569> not<00:03:19.379> okay<00:03:19.739> know<00:03:20.519> if<00:03:20.790> you<00:03:20.910> see

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
showing not okay know if you see

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.400 
showing not okay know if you see
anything<00:03:21.329> but<00:03:21.450> rubber<00:03:21.630> it's<00:03:21.810> time<00:03:21.989> to<00:03:22.169> replace

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
anything but rubber it's time to replace

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.559 
anything but rubber it's time to replace
that<00:03:22.560> tire<00:03:22.739> certainly<00:03:23.239> really<00:03:24.239> for<00:03:24.389> best
