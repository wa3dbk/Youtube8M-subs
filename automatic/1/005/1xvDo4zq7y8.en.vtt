00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
if this is the video on Ecola no swings

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.859 
if this is the video on Ecola no swings
we<00:00:17.570> get<00:00:17.900> we<00:00:18.199> get<00:00:18.380> a<00:00:18.439> single<00:00:18.800> brick<00:00:19.130> head<00:00:19.869> and

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869 
we get we get a single brick head and

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:28.620 
we get we get a single brick head and
now<00:00:21.349> we're<00:00:21.650> going<00:00:21.800> to<00:00:21.919> boil<00:00:22.430> the<00:00:22.700> water

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.040 

so<00:00:29.170> Iike<00:00:29.650> needs<00:00:30.490> three<00:00:31.090> to<00:00:31.150> four<00:00:31.540> liters<00:00:32.020> of

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
so Iike needs three to four liters of

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.580 
so Iike needs three to four liters of
boiling<00:00:32.680> hot<00:00:33.010> water<00:00:33.310> to<00:00:33.940> help<00:00:34.060> expand<00:00:34.720> and<00:00:35.440> it

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 
boiling hot water to help expand and it

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.350 
boiling hot water to help expand and it
will<00:00:35.740> expand<00:00:36.220> to<00:00:36.490> about<00:00:36.610> seven<00:00:37.120> to<00:00:37.239> eight

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
will expand to about seven to eight

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.130 
will expand to about seven to eight
liters<00:00:37.680> okay<00:00:38.680> right<00:00:38.980> now<00:00:39.160> I<00:00:39.190> am<00:00:39.610> boiling<00:00:40.140> 1/2

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
liters okay right now I am boiling 1/2

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.160 
liters okay right now I am boiling 1/2
liter<00:00:41.620> of<00:00:41.950> juice<00:00:42.070> twice<00:00:42.760> obviously<00:00:43.450> to<00:00:43.690> get<00:00:43.870> to

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
liter of juice twice obviously to get to

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.850 
liter of juice twice obviously to get to
three<00:00:44.860> liters<00:00:46.350> next<00:00:47.350> thing<00:00:47.470> you<00:00:47.620> need<00:00:47.830> to

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
three liters next thing you need to

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.680 
three liters next thing you need to
think<00:00:48.160> about<00:00:48.280> is<00:00:48.550> where<00:00:49.030> are<00:00:49.059> you<00:00:49.450> going<00:00:49.600> to

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
think about is where are you going to

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.740 
think about is where are you going to
put<00:00:49.930> the<00:00:50.290> in<00:00:50.440> color

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.490 

now<00:00:56.320> Ekeroth<00:00:56.710> will<00:00:57.280> expand<00:00:57.910> so<00:00:58.540> you<00:00:58.600> need<00:00:59.230> to

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
now Ekeroth will expand so you need to

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.390 
now Ekeroth will expand so you need to
put<00:00:59.650> it<00:00:59.739> in<00:00:59.920> a<00:01:00.190> box<00:01:00.900> that<00:01:01.900> will<00:01:02.110> not<00:01:02.290> let<00:01:03.280> it

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 
put it in a box that will not let it

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.810 
put it in a box that will not let it
drop<00:01:03.730> out<00:01:04.800> that's<00:01:05.800> kind<00:01:06.070> of<00:01:06.280> deep<00:01:06.430> that<00:01:06.729> will

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
drop out that's kind of deep that will

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.280 
drop out that's kind of deep that will
be<00:01:06.910> okay<00:01:07.270> also<00:01:07.870> make<00:01:08.410> sure<00:01:08.440> that<00:01:09.070> there<00:01:09.550> is<00:01:09.670> no

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
be okay also make sure that there is no

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.920 
be okay also make sure that there is no
like<00:01:11.290> other<00:01:11.670> substances<00:01:12.670> in<00:01:12.850> it<00:01:13.000> you<00:01:13.810> know

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
like other substances in it you know

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.010 
like other substances in it you know
like<00:01:14.140> washing<00:01:15.130> up<00:01:15.490> powder<00:01:15.790> or<00:01:16.420> anything<00:01:16.780> like

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
like washing up powder or anything like

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.340 
like washing up powder or anything like
that<00:01:17.200> obviously<00:01:17.440> that<00:01:17.650> will<00:01:17.830> harm<00:01:18.040> the<00:01:18.280> gecko

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
that obviously that will harm the gecko

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.859 
that obviously that will harm the gecko
so<00:01:20.350> I<00:01:20.380> put<00:01:20.650> the<00:01:20.740> Eco<00:01:21.160> earth<00:01:21.369> in<00:01:21.670> the<00:01:22.240> bowl<00:01:22.450> and

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
so I put the Eco earth in the bowl and

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.280 
so I put the Eco earth in the bowl and
this<00:01:23.770> will<00:01:24.310> expand<00:01:25.300> to<00:01:25.509> enough<00:01:25.750> dirt<00:01:26.050> for

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
this will expand to enough dirt for

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.190 
this will expand to enough dirt for
about<00:01:26.440> two<00:01:26.770> decades<00:01:27.160> or<00:01:27.759> two<00:01:28.270> the<00:01:28.450> variants<00:01:28.899> if

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
about two decades or two the variants if

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.730 
about two decades or two the variants if
they're<00:01:29.410> about<00:01:29.560> two<00:01:29.830> foot<00:01:30.160> by<00:01:30.190> foot<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:32.500> it

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
they're about two foot by foot and it

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.590 
they're about two foot by foot and it
will<00:01:32.860> last<00:01:33.040> for<00:01:33.490> six<00:01:33.940> months

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
will last for six months

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.940 
will last for six months
it<00:01:35.470> also<00:01:35.759> will<00:01:36.759> absorb<00:01:37.509> odors<00:01:37.810> and<00:01:38.440> waste

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
it also will absorb odors and waste

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:45.700 
it also will absorb odors and waste
products<00:01:39.340> so<00:01:39.520> that's<00:01:39.610> actually<00:01:40.030> really<00:01:40.210> good

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:02:01.740

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
amount of dirt in there there's a lot

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.780 
amount of dirt in there there's a lot
more<00:02:30.180> on<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.600> cool<00:02:30.870> end<00:02:31.050> which<00:02:31.590> is<00:02:31.920> this<00:02:32.520> end

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
more on the cool end which is this end

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.860 
more on the cool end which is this end
and<00:02:33.560> also<00:02:34.560> once<00:02:35.250> it<00:02:35.430> drives<00:02:35.850> it<00:02:36.150> will<00:02:36.360> go<00:02:36.660> down

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
and also once it drives it will go down

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.400 
and also once it drives it will go down
a<00:02:36.930> little<00:02:37.230> bit<00:02:37.410> that's<00:02:37.500> why<00:02:37.680> I<00:02:37.710> put<00:02:37.950> so<00:02:38.100> much<00:02:38.250> in

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
a little bit that's why I put so much in

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.710 
a little bit that's why I put so much in
the<00:02:40.410> hot<00:02:40.680> area<00:02:41.160> I<00:02:41.340> put<00:02:41.550> a<00:02:41.580> little<00:02:41.760> bit<00:02:41.910> less<00:02:41.970> so

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
the hot area I put a little bit less so

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.430 
the hot area I put a little bit less so
the<00:02:42.900> heat<00:02:43.050> will<00:02:43.170> come<00:02:43.350> through<00:02:43.790> okay<00:02:44.790> so

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
the heat will come through okay so

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.690 
the heat will come through okay so
everything<00:02:46.440> in<00:02:46.560> here<00:02:46.800> there<00:02:47.010> are<00:02:47.130> a<00:02:47.160> few<00:02:47.490> new
