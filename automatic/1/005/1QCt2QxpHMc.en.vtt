00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:14.759
 personnel and civilian can focus and another one 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:17.210
 little of it for you here is the key is the 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:23.000
 metal part used to start the car 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:25.880
 to do this there is a trading here where 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.770
 You first rule here, and then 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:33.660
 Powerful pulls in 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.660
 it has even all glass global 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.800
 and the ones below 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.540
 alone 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.400
 the gl version does not have this 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.250
 glx version 2.0 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.800
 many of the things he has today do not 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.440
 I have not even seen the electric rear already 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.170
 have and I will show the public outside 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.110
 First points I liked 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:04.220
 the tires they saw on it have a kind 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:06.170
 protection is that they make the wheel 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.610
 punk more English than she days they a 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:16.630
 little I just asked for a lot of help 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:21.440
 the suspension is she is independent behind 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:23.770
 which makes it very comfortable and tasty 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.770
 fasting 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.040
 on the back has only one backlight 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:43.480
 here is to get enough dust time I go 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.480
 although quite escape to Brazil 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:04.060
 in front he shaved quite a bit from the beginning 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:08.500
 with a good see the link that I will leave 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:11.260
 here the video below is divine opinion and 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.800
 I sent automotive news that did not 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:18.520
 It took a lot lately but is 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:23.010
 taking care enough tabbed wk 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.010
 gaitÃ¡n work soon opened the doors 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:41.519
 the hood is interesting, it 's not for 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:41.519
 within the headquarters of this key 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:53.360
 this key here is to use to open the hood or 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.360
 to lock the steering if you lose the key 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:17.450
 good 2.0 duratec engine and it has a 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.100
 Low sculpture here is dirty but not 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.130
 either with other cars do not have 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.600
 this coverage is that's what matters 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.070
 said no 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.070
 with that kind of thing 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:36.790
 What is this problem he had 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:39.349
 here was a player here leaking and the 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.400
 consultant says that there are few people 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:45.739
 this kind of problem 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:47.269
 and this piece here she hit the engine and 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:54.280
 speak of monza 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:59.269
 it seemed and this piece that also had 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:03.200
 Broken was changed to make noise 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:09.290
 one thing I do not like is that here she 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:14.540
 gets hot so it gets difficult to 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:16.689
 people are complicated open the key is good and 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.689
 bad 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:24.019
 because it is safe
