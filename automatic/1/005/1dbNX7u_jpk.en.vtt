in the phone the phone sim the phone is

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.810 
in the phone the phone sim the phone is
going<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.410> have<00:00:43.559> like<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.800> curve<00:00:44.160> like<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.430> on

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
going to have like a curve like this on

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.080 
going to have like a curve like this on
both<00:00:45.210> sides<00:00:45.739> but<00:00:46.739> here's<00:00:47.250> here's<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.820> thing

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
both sides but here's here's the thing

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.729 
both sides but here's here's the thing
here<00:00:48.329> it's<00:00:48.450> going<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.690> be<00:00:48.809> thirty<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.590> fifty

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
here it's going to be thirty to fifty

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.549 
here it's going to be thirty to fifty
percent<00:00:50.160> less<00:00:50.489> curved<00:00:51.020> and<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.260> reason

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
percent less curved and the reason

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.160 
percent less curved and the reason
because<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.340> because<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.969> phone<00:00:54.840> is

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
because of this is because the phone is

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.709 
because of this is because the phone is
in<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.920> galaxy<00:00:56.460> s6<00:00:56.760> eyes<00:00:57.030> like<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.300> 5-inch

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
in the galaxy s6 eyes like a 5-inch

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.290 
in the galaxy s6 eyes like a 5-inch
display<00:00:57.780> instead<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.100> like<00:00:59.879> a<00:01:00.149> with

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
display instead of a like a with

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.959 
display instead of a like a with
7-inch<00:01:00.780> note<00:01:01.469> edge<00:01:01.829> as<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.309> see<00:01:02.579> here<00:01:02.789> like

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
7-inch note edge as you see here like

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.910 
7-inch note edge as you see here like
this<00:01:03.180> note<00:01:03.510> sighs<00:01:03.809> that's<00:01:04.170> why<00:01:04.320> they<00:01:04.589> can<00:01:04.769> have

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
this note sighs that's why they can have

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.250 
this note sighs that's why they can have
like<00:01:05.129> this<00:01:05.369> big<00:01:05.850> curve<00:01:06.180> here<00:01:06.479> but<00:01:06.659> on<00:01:06.869> this

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
like this big curve here but on this

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.850 
like this big curve here but on this
smaller<00:01:07.710> size<00:01:08.460> phone<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.470> it<00:01:10.470> looks<00:01:10.770> like

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
smaller size phone and it looks like

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.560 
smaller size phone and it looks like
that's<00:01:11.100> why<00:01:11.310> they're<00:01:11.490> going<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.700> have<00:01:12.000> only<00:01:12.240> 30

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
that's why they're going to have only 30

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.249 
that's why they're going to have only 30
or<00:01:13.380> two<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:14.100> fifty<00:01:14.460> percent<00:01:14.640> less<00:01:14.939> curve<00:01:15.360> but

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
or two to fifty percent less curve but

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.640 
or two to fifty percent less curve but
there<00:01:16.409> also<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.830> another<00:01:17.100> reason<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.700> is

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
there also is another reason and that is

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.929 
there also is another reason and that is
because<00:01:19.650> they<00:01:19.830> are<00:01:19.920> going<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.310> have<00:01:20.520> power

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
because they are going to have power

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.749 
because they are going to have power
button<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.750> volume<00:01:21.869> buttons<00:01:22.470> on<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.250> side<00:01:23.460> as

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
button and volume buttons on the side as

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.830 
button and volume buttons on the side as
well<00:01:24.060> how<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:24.930> works<00:01:25.170> on<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.310> note<00:01:27.150> edge<00:01:27.450> here

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
well how it works on the note edge here

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.260 
well how it works on the note edge here
is<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.740> they<00:01:28.979> actually<00:01:29.310> move<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:30.060> up

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
is that you they actually move that up

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.420 
is that you they actually move that up
here<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:31.320> power<00:01:31.530> button<00:01:31.710> but<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.189> looks<00:01:32.340> like

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
here the power button but it looks like

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.240 
here the power button but it looks like
they're<00:01:32.670> going<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.909> have<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.210> around<00:01:33.840> here<00:01:34.439> on

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
they're going to have it around here on

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.840 
they're going to have it around here on
the<00:01:35.850> galaxy<00:01:36.750> s6<00:01:37.079> edge<00:01:37.350> or<00:01:37.740> galaxy<00:01:38.159> s<00:01:38.280> H<00:01:38.520> or

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
the galaxy s6 edge or galaxy s H or

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.310 
the galaxy s6 edge or galaxy s H or
galaxy<00:01:39.299> edge<00:01:39.390> whatever<00:01:39.840> now<00:01:39.990> they're<00:01:40.229> going
