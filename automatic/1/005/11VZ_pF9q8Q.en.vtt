 Binder technology for safe 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:31.769
 building sealing we look today 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.050
 the innovation product superflex 24 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.000
 at home weber deitermann to this 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.500
 product offers many advantages for 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.690
 the processor and also for the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.520
 private household we can with this 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.079
 product on the one hand building seal 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.120
 produce in the area of ​​the balcony 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.940
 Terrace renovation is also starting up 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.469
 existing coatings romance 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.329
 Apply the product is in 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.309
 essential from a rivers component 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.030
 the component a and a powder 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.550
 component of the component b we need 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.230
 here no more water 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.760
 it can bring significant benefits 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.100
 no alternative issued anymore 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.380
 will be another advantage around 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.119
 even when taking partial quantities 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.689
 the mixture ratio always one to 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.010
 one which also brings significant benefits 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:15.450
 Objects that are under time pressure 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.970
 always in this day and age 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.979
 theme with this product no problem 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.299
 You can already be on the wall after four 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.340
 usually heat insulation panels 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.130
 glue and the next day the 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.630
 to pour baugrube how each 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.430
 are steps and what is what 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.650
 Advantages of this product brings look 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.770
 on the basis of some examples to the 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.659
 then immediately introduce 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.520
 first topic grad spatula we have 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.220
 as a rule, here it under reasons with 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.720
 the coat of stones finished threatening places 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.240
 Fills here are many 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.310
 kieslaster juncker is basically 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.750
 said a deeper five meters deepen 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.579
 would have to be closed first 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.500
 We will also do a grass spatula 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.220
 and make a bubble 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.409
 avoid 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.939
 That will be a very important point 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.530
 This leveling spatula looks like it shows us 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.460
 like dani and back in the country 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.460
 offer us that right 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.330
 they are looking the right way 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.100
 process the monte plastic foils in 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.200
 Area of ​​floor plate going on 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.790
 masonry and subsequently the 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:19.290
 correct application of the seal 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:21.390
 superflex 24 on the wall too 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.160
 Detailed solutions can be made with this product 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.450
 be executed in the next 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.190
 Let's take a look at this 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.319
 other of our impermeable 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.790
 got spatula deitermann hag express 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.100
 we now see the individual here 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.180
 work steps and start in principle 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.840
 with the mediator with the 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.840
 so-called budget 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.280
 another advantage of this product 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.269
 is the deitermann hks fiber reinforced 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.459
 is what you see exactly here as well 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.459
 means you have it before painting before 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:54.200
 brushed around him to cling to the petermann 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.200
 hks mortar to ensure 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.880
 now old man has ice surface 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.989
 adjusted to a proper brought 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.390
 to be able to produce 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.190
 further you already have it 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.049
 permeable they can with this 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.299
 Hollow throat already water surface 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.579
 made mortar and also the 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:15.230
 ladder likes it as compensation for 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:15.230
 closures and for the net 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.599
 the thin set 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.220
 water-permeable mortar for the 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:26.640
 Agent before deleted in the 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.640
 fall here 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:37.329
 here is the product spatula capable 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.060
 set we see the stick here 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:41.560
 heat insulation boards gluing the with 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.329
 the plates take place here with the same 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.540
 Product is made the seal 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:48.220
 is in this case superflex 24 the 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.200
 heat the plates are pointwise 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.200
 glued only in groundwater and 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.120
 pressurized water area they become 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.930
 glued over the entire surface to infiltrate 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.930
 to prevent the water 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:03.489
 on the basis of this practical example 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:05.379
 is one can the many advantages of 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.420
 superflex recognize the 24 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:10.180
 fast by drying lightly 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.280
 processability of the product fast 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.750
 rain strength bit relatively soon 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.849
 also fast pressure waterproof and 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.680
 Of course, this also ensures one 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:19.810
 fast behind fill the pit all 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.440
 These advantages help us one 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.440
 rapid construction progress
