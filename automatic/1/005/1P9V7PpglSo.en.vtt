numbness and tingling that goes down the

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.750 
numbness and tingling that goes down the
arm<00:01:00.360> so<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.260> can<00:01:01.469> actually<00:01:01.710> be<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.039> very<00:01:02.489> much<00:01:02.699> of

reach<00:01:57.060> above<00:01:57.569> my<00:01:57.750> head<00:01:57.929> so<00:01:58.080> I<00:01:58.140> had<00:01:58.289> to<00:01:58.380> go<00:01:58.500> get<00:01:58.649> a

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
reach above my head so I had to go get a

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:00.410 
reach above my head so I had to go get a
shot<00:01:58.950> for<00:01:59.220> that<00:01:59.310> but<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.819> know<00:01:59.940> how<00:02:00.090> much<00:02:00.239> your

00:02:02.089 --> 00:02:02.099 
purse weight and actually I think it

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:04.400 
purse weight and actually I think it
weighed<00:02:02.250> more<00:02:02.489> than<00:02:02.550> this<00:02:02.819> how<00:02:03.330> much<00:02:03.509> 10

pounds

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.389 
pounds
now<00:02:06.330> if<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.569> factor<00:02:06.840> in<00:02:07.080> 10<00:02:07.319> pounds<00:02:07.920> then<00:02:08.099> 5

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
now if you factor in 10 pounds then 5

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.800 
now if you factor in 10 pounds then 5
pounds<00:02:08.819> for<00:02:08.940> your<00:02:09.060> breasts<00:02:09.390> or<00:02:09.479> something
