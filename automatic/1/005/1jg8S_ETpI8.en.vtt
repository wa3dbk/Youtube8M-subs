00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.929 
of with BSF through the arm series and
now<00:01:36.840> we're<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.079> RM<00:01:37.409> low<00:01:38.039> VOCs<00:01:38.280> solvent<00:01:38.850> that

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
now we're the RM low VOCs solvent that

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.309 
now we're the RM low VOCs solvent that
were<00:01:39.030> actually<00:01:39.270> spraying<00:01:39.450> now<00:01:39.630> which<00:01:40.200> is

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:40.319 
were actually spraying now which is

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:41.959 
were actually spraying now which is
amazing<00:01:40.409> biggest<00:01:41.280> thing<00:01:41.399> on<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.609> is<00:01:41.670> we<00:01:41.880> can

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:41.969 
amazing biggest thing on that is we can

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:44.149 
amazing biggest thing on that is we can
actually<00:01:42.090> do<00:01:42.299> faster<00:01:42.899> graphics<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.950> know<00:01:43.979> the

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
actually do faster graphics you know the

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.950 
actually do faster graphics you know the
textures<00:01:44.729> are<00:01:44.850> better<00:01:44.999> be<00:01:45.329> more<00:01:45.719> pearls

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
textures are better be more pearls

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.809 
textures are better be more pearls
solvents<00:01:46.679> and<00:01:46.859> a<00:01:47.009> faster<00:01:47.369> time<00:01:47.520> we<00:01:47.640> have<00:01:47.759> to

00:01:47.809 --> 00:01:47.819 
solvents and a faster time we have to

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:49.309 
solvents and a faster time we have to
get<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:47.999> product<00:01:48.270> out<00:01:48.299> sooner<00:01:48.539> before<00:01:49.109> we<00:01:49.200> got

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:49.319 
get the product out sooner before we got

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:50.779 
get the product out sooner before we got
BSF<00:01:49.770> we<00:01:49.920> really<00:01:50.069> had<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.219> problem<00:01:50.429> with<00:01:50.670> the

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
BSF we really had a problem with the

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:52.429 
BSF we really had a problem with the
other<00:01:50.880> quality<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.899> cards<00:01:52.170> not<00:01:52.259> being

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
other quality and the cards not being

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.129 
other quality and the cards not being
what<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.590> wanted<00:01:53.009> so<00:01:53.460> one<00:01:53.609> BSF<00:01:54.060> came<00:01:54.270> in<00:01:54.450> you

00:01:55.129 --> 00:01:55.139 
what I wanted so one BSF came in you

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:56.120 
what I wanted so one BSF came in you
know<00:01:55.259> they're<00:01:55.649> probably<00:01:55.829> one<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.039> most

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
know they're probably one the most

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.950 
know they're probably one the most
important<00:01:56.609> parts<00:01:56.639> of<00:01:56.969> our<00:01:57.060> build<00:01:57.359> you<00:01:57.840> know

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
important parts of our build you know

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.059 
important parts of our build you know
whenever<00:01:58.139> you<00:01:58.289> paint<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.469> car<00:01:58.649> that's<00:01:58.889> really

00:01:59.059 --> 00:01:59.069 
whenever you paint a car that's really

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:00.319 
whenever you paint a car that's really
the<00:01:59.280> finish<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.639> what<00:01:59.789> you<00:01:59.850> want<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.240> know

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
the finish of what you want you know

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.940 
the finish of what you want you know
when<00:02:00.479> people<00:02:00.630> look<00:02:00.929> at<00:02:01.049> these<00:02:01.229> parts<00:02:01.560> the

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
when people look at these parts the

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.230 
when people look at these parts the
number<00:02:02.189> one<00:02:02.280> thing<00:02:02.429> they<00:02:02.520> go<00:02:02.639> to<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:02.969> finish

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
number one thing they go to is finish

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.760 
number one thing they go to is finish
the<00:02:03.420> exterior<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:04.049> then<00:02:04.409> they<00:02:04.499> look<00:02:04.679> at

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
the exterior and then they look at

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.889 
the exterior and then they look at
everything<00:02:04.979> else<00:02:05.159> so<00:02:05.880> with<00:02:06.119> that<00:02:06.270> paint<00:02:06.539> we've

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
everything else so with that paint we've

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.240 
everything else so with that paint we've
been<00:02:07.170> painting<00:02:07.380> here<00:02:07.590> both<00:02:07.740> three<00:02:07.979> years<00:02:08.160> of

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
been painting here both three years of

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.609 
been painting here both three years of
BSF<00:02:08.610> never<00:02:09.060> had<00:02:09.240> one<00:02:09.390> car<00:02:09.569> returned<00:02:09.869> which<00:02:10.470> is

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
BSF never had one car returned which is

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.140 
BSF never had one car returned which is
