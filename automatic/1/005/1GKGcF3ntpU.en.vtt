00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.370

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:21.350
 but i meet a holy africa 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:21.350

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.490

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.750

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.960

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.790
 was killed shortly before the headshot 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.370
 you all saw everyone, I think 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.290
 If I let you go, it was a bald man 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.870
 friend let us take him there 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.640
 I would feel someone my poverty 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:56.829
 to hope 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.520
 and yet not always the alta can 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.280
 Not be 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:09.670
 eight he also knows what hope roof 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:10.780
 for a god my god killed little something 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.320
 in some way this is just round 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.320
 finished 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:25.190
 what is that supposed to be anyway? 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:26.150
 opponent there is somewhere me 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.680
 I wanted to say to Lose 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.860
 his perfect seal but I was 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.860
 a little bit 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:46.500
 There is an enemy on it and I shoot it 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:48.720
 dead and not from behind 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.860
 I thought there are just in the 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.479
 direction three teammates with me 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.299
 sprinted and still from behind 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.110
 killed here and there is one 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.110
 I will 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:10.619
 I thought I thought I did 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:14.519
 Died to myself okay if I'm with 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:21.800
 my park bench remembers there are quite a lot 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:21.800
 gamer base in the car is dangerous 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:29.300
 I did not see anything but he is dead 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.300
 Hamburg 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.750
 Hip was from all sides 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.700
 This game is handicapped when I left 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.410
 So close to the camera they are hardly 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.510
 although you actually meet if the 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:50.600
 Being so close is so much better 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.600
 hit in the face with his fist 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.709
 age these maps are somehow a 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.329
 a bit strange because my sport 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.530
 somehow always somewhere else and the 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.209
 people are always somewhere somehow 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.930
 different that you always from the back 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.930
 is shot down 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.409
 I killed something 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.430
 why is that not dead and what 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:25.420
 was that? 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.420
 why do they have a vehicle at all ? 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:43.510
 hahahahaha clearly lost shit in peace 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:43.510
 Poland is doing your job and almost dead 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.740
 I looked at it so badly 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.950
 I did not even die 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.950
 met
