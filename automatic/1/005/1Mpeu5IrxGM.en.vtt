up about the V set dogs and swarm I know
like<00:03:05.850> like<00:03:06.750> earlier<00:03:07.080> my<00:03:07.200> videos<00:03:07.530> I<00:03:07.740> said<00:03:08.010> like

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
like like earlier my videos I said like

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.070 
like like earlier my videos I said like
the<00:03:08.340> Loadstar<00:03:08.940> every<00:03:09.360> post<00:03:09.570> a<00:03:09.630> video<00:03:09.720> same

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
the Loadstar every post a video same

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.010 
the Loadstar every post a video same
like<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.260> loadstar<00:03:11.420> maybe<00:03:12.420> better<00:03:12.690> than<00:03:12.810> the

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
like a loadstar maybe better than the

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.900 
like a loadstar maybe better than the
swarm<00:03:13.290> and<00:03:13.890> I've<00:03:14.040> got<00:03:14.250> to<00:03:14.340> swarm<00:03:14.580> a<00:03:14.670> couple

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
swarm and I've got to swarm a couple

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.220 
swarm and I've got to swarm a couple
times<00:03:15.090> before<00:03:15.240> I<00:03:15.450> made<00:03:15.600> that<00:03:15.720> video<00:03:15.840> that's

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
times before I made that video that's

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.480 
times before I made that video that's
the<00:03:16.350> reason<00:03:16.560> why<00:03:16.650> I<00:03:16.680> said<00:03:16.770> that<00:03:16.950> I'm<00:03:17.190> not<00:03:17.220> just

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
the reason why I said that I'm not just

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.280 
the reason why I said that I'm not just
gonna<00:03:17.550> say<00:03:17.820> something<00:03:18.209> for<00:03:18.810> you<00:03:18.900> know<00:03:19.020> not

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
gonna say something for you know not

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.949 
gonna say something for you know not
having<00:03:19.470> any<00:03:19.830> you<00:03:20.760> know<00:03:20.880> any<00:03:20.910> proof<00:03:21.420> behind<00:03:21.810> it

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
having any you know any proof behind it

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.990 
having any you know any proof behind it
or<00:03:22.050> any<00:03:22.230> evidence<00:03:22.500> no<00:03:23.130> playtime<00:03:23.550> behind<00:03:23.880> I'm

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
or any evidence no playtime behind I'm

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.250 
or any evidence no playtime behind I'm
not<00:03:24.120> just<00:03:24.240> gonna<00:03:24.300> do<00:03:24.540> that<00:03:24.660> I'm<00:03:24.780> gonna<00:03:24.930> put<00:03:25.170> the

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
not just gonna do that I'm gonna put the

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.570 
not just gonna do that I'm gonna put the
time<00:03:25.470> in<00:03:25.650> and<00:03:25.830> then<00:03:26.010> I'm<00:03:26.100> gonna<00:03:26.190> give<00:03:26.370> my

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
time in and then I'm gonna give my

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.640 
time in and then I'm gonna give my
opinion<00:03:26.940> on<00:03:27.060> it<00:03:27.180> and<00:03:27.300> so<00:03:27.810> that's<00:03:28.230> what<00:03:28.380> I<00:03:28.410> did

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
opinion on it and so that's what I did

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.410 
opinion on it and so that's what I did
and<00:03:28.860> at<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.490> time<00:03:29.700> I<00:03:29.730> didn't<00:03:30.120> really<00:03:30.240> like

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
and at the time I didn't really like

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.910 
and at the time I didn't really like
swarm<00:03:30.750> I<00:03:30.840> thought<00:03:31.020> it<00:03:31.110> was<00:03:31.230> overrated<00:03:31.440> thought

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
swarm I thought it was overrated thought

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.320 
swarm I thought it was overrated thought
I<00:03:31.950> was<00:03:32.100> just<00:03:32.250> you<00:03:32.580> know<00:03:32.670> just<00:03:32.850> a<00:03:32.970> really<00:03:33.090> high

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
I was just you know just a really high

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.960 
I was just you know just a really high
streak<00:03:33.720> that<00:03:33.930> was<00:03:34.340> not<00:03:35.340> worth<00:03:35.580> getting<00:03:35.760> I

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
streak that was not worth getting I

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.400 
streak that was not worth getting I
thought<00:03:36.150> low<00:03:36.540> start<00:03:36.840> would<00:03:36.930> be<00:03:36.959> better<00:03:37.170> but

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
thought low start would be better but

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.750 
thought low start would be better but
then<00:03:37.560> playing<00:03:37.890> this<00:03:38.040> game<00:03:38.220> a<00:03:38.280> lot<00:03:38.520> getting

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
then playing this game a lot getting

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.940 
then playing this game a lot getting
swarm<00:03:39.150> then<00:03:39.810> getting<00:03:40.080> dogs<00:03:40.290> at<00:03:40.530> same<00:03:40.740> time

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
swarm then getting dogs at same time

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.090 
swarm then getting dogs at same time
it's<00:03:41.280> like<00:03:41.400> dang<00:03:42.470> it's<00:03:43.470> a<00:03:43.590> great<00:03:43.800> combination

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
it's like dang it's a great combination

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.979 
it's like dang it's a great combination
sometimes<00:03:44.790> I<00:03:44.940> call<00:03:45.090> both<00:03:45.300> men<00:03:45.570> at<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.780> same

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
sometimes I call both men at the same

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.860 
sometimes I call both men at the same
time<00:03:46.230> while<00:03:47.190> others<00:03:47.610> I'll<00:03:47.880> just<00:03:48.120> you<00:03:48.690> know<00:03:48.750> to

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
time while others I'll just you know to

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.120 
time while others I'll just you know to
spread<00:03:49.230> them<00:03:49.350> out<00:03:49.410> a<00:03:49.470> little<00:03:49.560> bit<00:03:49.709> so<00:03:49.890> I<00:03:49.920> get

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
spread them out a little bit so I get

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.860 
spread them out a little bit so I get
more<00:03:50.280> kills<00:03:50.520> it<00:03:51.150> really<00:03:51.390> just<00:03:51.510> spins<00:03:51.720> how<00:03:51.840> I
