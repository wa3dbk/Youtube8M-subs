 A quarter of the people of Noah 1 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.190
 After this one quarter outside 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.850

 My grandson I used to make brown so that I can understand it, but this time 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.769
 Transparent so as not to be noticeable 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.769
 Use a silicon rubber 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:27.800
