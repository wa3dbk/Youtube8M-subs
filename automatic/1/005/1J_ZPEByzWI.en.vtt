00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:18.429 
processing and to do that we have

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:21.029 
processing and to do that we have
selected<00:00:18.640> exercise<00:00:19.330> file<00:00:19.539> 2-11<00:00:20.170> which<00:00:20.800> is<00:00:20.920> our

lovely car here I'm going to take it

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.230 
lovely car here I'm going to take it
into<00:00:23.380> the<00:00:23.710> develop<00:00:24.100> module<00:00:24.430> by<00:00:24.550> hitting<00:00:24.699> D<00:00:24.940> and

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240 
into the develop module by hitting D and

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.420 
into the develop module by hitting D and
this<00:00:25.810> car<00:00:25.990> isn't<00:00:26.170> so<00:00:26.380> lovely<00:00:26.710> hopefully<00:00:27.070> none

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
this car isn't so lovely hopefully none

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.099 
this car isn't so lovely hopefully none
of<00:00:27.550> you<00:00:27.640> guys<00:00:27.760> are<00:00:27.940> driving<00:00:28.630> this<00:00:28.689> car<00:00:28.869> around

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:29.109 
of you guys are driving this car around

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:30.660 
of you guys are driving this car around
or<00:00:29.199> attempting<00:00:29.590> to<00:00:29.710> you<00:00:29.770> because<00:00:30.490> I<00:00:30.550> don't

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:30.670 
or attempting to you because I don't

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:31.830 
or attempting to you because I don't
think<00:00:30.699> that'll<00:00:31.000> work<00:00:31.029> out<00:00:31.210> so<00:00:31.390> well<00:00:31.539> for<00:00:31.570> you

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
think that'll work out so well for you

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.569 
think that'll work out so well for you
but<00:00:32.559> let's<00:00:32.859> make<00:00:33.039> sure<00:00:33.070> that<00:00:33.309> we<00:00:33.399> have

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:33.579 
but let's make sure that we have

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:35.190 
but let's make sure that we have
snapshot<00:00:34.149> zero<00:00:34.510> one<00:00:34.690> color<00:00:34.930> click<00:00:35.050> is

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.200 
snapshot zero one color click is

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.110 
snapshot zero one color click is
selected<00:00:35.649> if<00:00:35.920> you<00:00:36.340> don't<00:00:36.610> have<00:00:36.790> this<00:00:36.970> is

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
selected if you don't have this is

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.970 
selected if you don't have this is
probably<00:00:37.510> because<00:00:37.780> you've<00:00:38.140> been<00:00:38.170> a<00:00:38.350> bad<00:00:38.710> kid

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
probably because you've been a bad kid

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.590 
probably because you've been a bad kid
and<00:00:39.220> you<00:00:39.280> have<00:00:39.460> skipped<00:00:39.850> our<00:00:40.329> color

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
and you have skipped our color

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.959 
and you have skipped our color
correction<00:00:40.780> on<00:00:41.200> this<00:00:41.350> on<00:00:41.590> this<00:00:41.860> image<00:00:42.160> so<00:00:42.850> make

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:42.969 
correction on this on this image so make

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:44.069 
correction on this on this image so make
sure<00:00:43.000> you<00:00:43.149> go<00:00:43.239> back<00:00:43.270> and<00:00:43.660> do<00:00:43.750> that<00:00:43.870> in<00:00:43.989> that

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.079 
sure you go back and do that in that

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:46.470 
sure you go back and do that in that
previous<00:00:44.440> chapter<00:00:44.890> now<00:00:45.880> we're<00:00:46.120> gonna<00:00:46.210> start

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
previous chapter now we're gonna start

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.580 
previous chapter now we're gonna start
from<00:00:46.630> this<00:00:46.750> point<00:00:46.960> and<00:00:47.200> we're<00:00:47.290> gonna<00:00:47.379> do

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.590 
from this point and we're gonna do

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.290 
from this point and we're gonna do
something<00:00:47.980> that's<00:00:48.219> called<00:00:48.430> digital<00:00:48.850> cross

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
something that's called digital cross

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.880 
something that's called digital cross
processing<00:00:49.870> I<00:00:50.050> want<00:00:50.350> to<00:00:50.410> explain<00:00:50.680> a<00:00:50.739> little

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
processing I want to explain a little

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.100 
processing I want to explain a little
bit<00:00:51.070> that<00:00:51.370> digital<00:00:52.329> cross<00:00:52.510> processing<00:00:52.960> is

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
bit that digital cross processing is

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.869 
bit that digital cross processing is
very<00:00:53.469> much<00:00:53.680> different<00:00:54.129> from<00:00:54.190> cross

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
very much different from cross

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:56.250 
very much different from cross
processing<00:00:55.360> and<00:00:55.539> where<00:00:55.750> it<00:00:55.870> that<00:00:56.050> term

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
processing and where it that term

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.889 
processing and where it that term
originally<00:00:56.770> came<00:00:57.010> from<00:00:57.239> cross<00:00:58.239> processing<00:00:58.719> is

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 
originally came from cross processing is

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:00.090 
originally came from cross processing is
basically<00:00:59.170> a<00:00:59.260> process<00:00:59.500> that<00:00:59.710> we<00:00:59.829> used<00:00:59.980> to<00:01:00.039> be

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
basically a process that we used to be

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.889 
basically a process that we used to be
done<00:01:00.219> on<00:01:00.309> film<00:01:00.610> where<00:01:00.940> a<00:01:01.149> photographer<00:01:01.809> to

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
done on film where a photographer to

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:03.060 
done on film where a photographer to
shoot<00:01:01.930> something<00:01:02.410> and<00:01:02.530> say<00:01:02.649> a<00:01:02.680> certain<00:01:02.860> time

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
shoot something and say a certain time

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.189 
shoot something and say a certain time
in<00:01:03.160> film<00:01:03.430> and<00:01:03.699> rather<00:01:04.449> than<00:01:04.659> processing<00:01:05.079> it

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
in film and rather than processing it

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.039 
in film and rather than processing it
and<00:01:05.379> the<00:01:05.829> type<00:01:06.009> of<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:07.060> know<00:01:07.090> chemicals<00:01:07.869> that

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
and the type of you know chemicals that

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:09.959 
and the type of you know chemicals that
should<00:01:08.319> have<00:01:08.409> been<00:01:08.529> used<00:01:08.740> for<00:01:08.889> that<00:01:08.950> film<00:01:09.279> they

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:09.969 
should have been used for that film they

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:11.459 
should have been used for that film they
use<00:01:10.299> a<00:01:10.329> different<00:01:10.840> chemical<00:01:11.109> that<00:01:11.350> was

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:11.469 
use a different chemical that was

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:13.080 
use a different chemical that was
designed<00:01:11.770> for<00:01:12.009> a<00:01:12.069> different<00:01:12.219> type<00:01:12.729> of<00:01:12.759> film

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
designed for a different type of film

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.349 
designed for a different type of film
hence<00:01:13.869> the<00:01:14.079> term<00:01:14.259> cross<00:01:14.709> processing<00:01:15.189> now<00:01:16.179> what

00:01:16.349 --> 00:01:16.359 
hence the term cross processing now what

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:18.179 
hence the term cross processing now what
that<00:01:16.389> process<00:01:16.929> does<00:01:17.170> is<00:01:17.200> it<00:01:17.560> creates<00:01:17.709> all

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
that process does is it creates all

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:19.830 
that process does is it creates all
sorts<00:01:18.459> of<00:01:18.520> crazy<00:01:18.670> wacky<00:01:18.939> colors<00:01:19.420> they<00:01:19.539> can<00:01:19.689> add

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
sorts of crazy wacky colors they can add

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.510 
sorts of crazy wacky colors they can add
greens<00:01:20.289> to<00:01:20.529> the<00:01:20.619> highlights<00:01:21.009> and<00:01:21.219> blues<00:01:21.490> to

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
greens to the highlights and blues to

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.879 
greens to the highlights and blues to
the<00:01:21.700> shadows<00:01:22.119> and<00:01:22.329> boost<00:01:22.959> overall<00:01:23.319> Red's<00:01:23.679> it

00:01:23.879 --> 00:01:23.889 
the shadows and boost overall Red's it

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:25.349 
the shadows and boost overall Red's it
can<00:01:24.009> make<00:01:24.159> skin<00:01:24.429> tone<00:01:24.639> look<00:01:24.880> like<00:01:25.029> you<00:01:25.270> know

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:25.359 
can make skin tone look like you know

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:26.760 
can make skin tone look like you know
your<00:01:25.389> own<00:01:25.659> balloon<00:01:25.899> buzz<00:01:26.109> and<00:01:26.229> all<00:01:26.319> orange<00:01:26.649> and

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
your own balloon buzz and all orange and

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.440 
your own balloon buzz and all orange and
stuff<00:01:26.920> it<00:01:27.399> kind<00:01:27.579> of<00:01:27.609> just<00:01:27.759> had<00:01:27.880> this<00:01:28.029> wacky

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
stuff it kind of just had this wacky

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.309 
stuff it kind of just had this wacky
kind<00:01:29.020> of<00:01:29.109> crazy<00:01:30.009> look<00:01:30.310> to<00:01:30.429> the<00:01:30.520> images<00:01:30.909> and

00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:31.319 
kind of crazy look to the images and

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:33.539 
kind of crazy look to the images and
often<00:01:32.319> times<00:01:32.499> it<00:01:32.649> actually<00:01:32.679> came<00:01:33.069> out<00:01:33.219> looking

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
often times it actually came out looking

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.760 
often times it actually came out looking
like<00:01:33.579> you<00:01:34.389> know<00:01:34.450> a<00:01:34.539> vintage<00:01:34.990> photograph<00:01:35.499> where

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
like you know a vintage photograph where

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.289 
like you know a vintage photograph where
you<00:01:36.039> know<00:01:36.130> you<00:01:36.189> have<00:01:36.399> amplified<00:01:36.819> colors<00:01:37.179> in

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
you know you have amplified colors in

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:39.029 
you know you have amplified colors in
certain<00:01:37.569> areas<00:01:37.810> and<00:01:37.840> stuff<00:01:38.079> and<00:01:38.319> that's<00:01:38.829> why<00:01:39.009> I

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:39.039 
certain areas and stuff and that's why I

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:40.800 
certain areas and stuff and that's why I
think<00:01:39.189> today<00:01:39.609> people<00:01:39.849> kind<00:01:40.119> of<00:01:40.209> confuse<00:01:40.539> cross

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
think today people kind of confuse cross

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.449 
think today people kind of confuse cross
processing<00:01:41.259> with<00:01:41.409> vintage<00:01:41.829> photographs<00:01:42.310> is

00:01:42.449 --> 00:01:42.459 
processing with vintage photographs is

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:44.580 
processing with vintage photographs is
because<00:01:42.789> it<00:01:43.419> kind<00:01:43.659> of<00:01:43.719> simulates<00:01:44.169> that<00:01:44.229> effect

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
because it kind of simulates that effect

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.919 
because it kind of simulates that effect
to<00:01:45.009> an<00:01:45.130> extent<00:01:45.669> now<00:01:46.119> some<00:01:46.389> cross<00:01:46.599> processing

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929 
to an extent now some cross processing

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:48.510 
to an extent now some cross processing
looks<00:01:47.139> crazy<00:01:47.439> wacky<00:01:47.739> and<00:01:47.979> it<00:01:48.039> just<00:01:48.189> looks<00:01:48.369> like

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
looks crazy wacky and it just looks like

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.729 
looks crazy wacky and it just looks like
you<00:01:48.700> know<00:01:48.789> a<00:01:48.969> toy<00:01:49.209> effect<00:01:49.630> but<00:01:50.229> there<00:01:50.590> are

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:50.739 
you know a toy effect but there are

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:52.349 
you know a toy effect but there are
styles<00:01:51.099> of<00:01:51.399> cross<00:01:51.549> processing<00:01:51.909> that<00:01:52.060> can<00:01:52.179> make

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:52.359 
styles of cross processing that can make

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:54.449 
styles of cross processing that can make
images<00:01:52.749> look<00:01:53.079> like<00:01:53.109> vintage<00:01:53.829> tone<00:01:54.009> images

00:01:54.449 --> 00:01:54.459 
images look like vintage tone images

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:56.309 
images look like vintage tone images
where<00:01:54.669> you<00:01:54.789> have<00:01:54.969> you<00:01:55.450> know<00:01:55.479> amplified<00:01:56.049> blues

00:01:56.309 --> 00:01:56.319 
where you have you know amplified blues

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:57.989 
where you have you know amplified blues
and<00:01:56.469> the<00:01:56.529> shadows<00:01:56.950> and<00:01:57.279> you<00:01:57.429> know<00:01:57.520> more<00:01:57.669> greens

00:01:57.989 --> 00:01:57.999 
and the shadows and you know more greens

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:59.909 
and the shadows and you know more greens
and<00:01:58.149> the<00:01:58.209> highlights<00:01:58.630> and<00:01:58.899> boosted<00:01:59.590> Reds<00:01:59.799> and

00:01:59.909 --> 00:01:59.919 
and the highlights and boosted Reds and

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:01.139 
and the highlights and boosted Reds and
the<00:02:00.009> highlights<00:02:00.369> and<00:02:00.520> stuff<00:02:00.669> like<00:02:00.759> that<00:02:00.939> and

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
the highlights and stuff like that and

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:02.519 
the highlights and stuff like that and
that's<00:02:01.749> really<00:02:01.959> the<00:02:02.139> effect<00:02:02.349> that<00:02:02.439> we're

00:02:02.519 --> 00:02:02.529 
that's really the effect that we're

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:04.109 
that's really the effect that we're
gonna<00:02:02.619> be<00:02:02.739> creating<00:02:03.009> with<00:02:03.489> digital<00:02:03.939> cross

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
gonna be creating with digital cross

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:05.909 
gonna be creating with digital cross
processing<00:02:04.509> we're<00:02:05.049> gonna<00:02:05.139> be<00:02:05.319> going<00:02:05.469> into<00:02:05.709> our

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:05.919 
processing we're gonna be going into our

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:07.409 
processing we're gonna be going into our
tone<00:02:06.159> curve<00:02:06.399> and<00:02:06.549> and<00:02:06.669> in<00:02:06.759> different<00:02:07.119> the

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:07.419 
tone curve and and in different the

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:09.949 
tone curve and and in different the
color<00:02:07.899> channels<00:02:08.319> to<00:02:08.770> create<00:02:09.069> that<00:02:09.160> effect<00:02:09.520> so

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
color channels to create that effect so

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.390 
color channels to create that effect so
cross<00:02:10.959> processing<00:02:11.260> digitally<00:02:11.650> and<00:02:11.860> on<00:02:12.099> film

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
cross processing digitally and on film

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.350 
cross processing digitally and on film
are<00:02:12.640> two<00:02:12.760> different<00:02:13.030> things

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
are two different things

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.880 
are two different things
we<00:02:13.599> can<00:02:13.780> kind<00:02:13.959> of<00:02:14.079> use<00:02:14.140> digital<00:02:14.590> cross

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
we can kind of use digital cross

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.410 
we can kind of use digital cross
processing<00:02:15.219> as<00:02:15.310> simulate

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
processing as simulate

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.210 
processing as simulate
the<00:02:16.540> effects<00:02:16.810> that<00:02:16.930> you<00:02:17.050> get<00:02:17.230> with<00:02:17.500> film<00:02:17.980> cross

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
the effects that you get with film cross

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.520 
the effects that you get with film cross
processing<00:02:18.610> though<00:02:18.760> alright<00:02:19.360> let's<00:02:20.349> get

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
processing though alright let's get

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.770 
processing though alright let's get
started<00:02:20.590> that's<00:02:21.099> enough<00:02:21.400> jibber-jabber

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
started that's enough jibber-jabber

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.510 
started that's enough jibber-jabber
let's<00:02:22.780> load<00:02:23.140> up<00:02:23.349> our<00:02:23.530> tone<00:02:23.830> curve<00:02:24.040> pallet<00:02:24.430> by

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
let's load up our tone curve pallet by

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.240 
let's load up our tone curve pallet by
hitting<00:02:24.700> control<00:02:25.090> 2<00:02:25.360> or<00:02:26.260> panel<00:02:26.739> rather<00:02:26.980> I'm

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
hitting control 2 or panel rather I'm

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.140 
hitting control 2 or panel rather I'm
going<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:27.520> keep<00:02:27.670> calling<00:02:27.849> these<00:02:27.970> things

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
going to keep calling these things

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.210 
going to keep calling these things
pallets<00:02:28.480> I'm<00:02:28.569> so<00:02:28.690> used<00:02:28.840> to<00:02:28.930> photoshop<00:02:29.230> alright

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
pallets I'm so used to photoshop alright

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.949 
pallets I'm so used to photoshop alright
so<00:02:30.520> with<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.120> tone<00:02:31.300> curve<00:02:31.480> selected<00:02:31.840> what

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
so with the tone curve selected what

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.660 
so with the tone curve selected what
we're<00:02:32.050> going<00:02:32.170> to<00:02:32.200> do<00:02:32.319> is<00:02:32.470> go<00:02:32.590> down<00:02:32.739> to<00:02:32.980> RGB<00:02:33.400> if

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
we're going to do is go down to RGB if

these regions thing here which is like I
said<00:02:46.360> before<00:02:46.480> it's<00:02:47.260> something<00:02:47.500> I<00:02:47.560> never<00:02:47.739> do<00:02:47.950> if

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
said before it's something I never do if

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.710 
said before it's something I never do if
I<00:02:48.250> want<00:02:48.430> to<00:02:48.489> adjust<00:02:48.550> my<00:02:48.790> tone<00:02:49.000> curve<00:02:49.209> I<00:02:49.420> adjust

I want to adjust my tone curve I adjust

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.420 
I want to adjust my tone curve I adjust
it<00:02:49.840> manually<00:02:50.200> if<00:02:50.410> I<00:02:50.530> don't<00:02:50.800> I<00:02:50.980> use<00:02:51.160> my<00:02:51.280> basic

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
it manually if I don't I use my basic

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.370 
it manually if I don't I use my basic
sliders<00:02:52.030> there's<00:02:52.569> no<00:02:52.750> point<00:02:52.989> in<00:02:53.080> using<00:02:53.290> these

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
sliders there's no point in using these

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.930 
sliders there's no point in using these
sliders<00:02:53.650> down<00:02:53.860> here<00:02:54.190> to<00:02:54.370> adjust<00:02:54.459> your<00:02:54.700> tone

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
sliders down here to adjust your tone

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.370 
sliders down here to adjust your tone
curve<00:02:55.120> when<00:02:55.330> you<00:02:55.450> have<00:02:55.600> the<00:02:55.750> exact<00:02:55.959> same<00:02:56.140> thing

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
curve when you have the exact same thing

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.440 
curve when you have the exact same thing
up<00:02:56.500> in<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.680> basic<00:02:57.010> module<00:02:57.370> or<00:02:57.760> a<00:02:57.819> basic<00:02:58.239> panel

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
up in the basic module or a basic panel

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.520 
up in the basic module or a basic panel
so<00:02:59.319> let's<00:02:59.709> click<00:02:59.950> to<00:03:00.130> edit<00:03:00.280> our<00:03:00.580> point<00:03:00.819> curve

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
so let's click to edit our point curve

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.289 
so let's click to edit our point curve
now<00:03:02.530> we<00:03:02.590> have<00:03:03.010> the<00:03:03.130> option<00:03:03.489> in<00:03:03.640> Lightroom<00:03:04.000> 4

basically our shadow detail just becomes

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.390 
basically our shadow detail just becomes
like<00:04:33.030> this<00:04:33.240> kind<00:04:33.990> of<00:04:34.110> sludgy<00:04:34.650> gray<00:04:34.950> look<00:04:35.220> and

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
like this kind of sludgy gray look and

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.860 
like this kind of sludgy gray look and
because<00:04:35.669> we've<00:04:35.820> added<00:04:35.910> Blues<00:04:36.330> of<00:04:36.360> the<00:04:36.540> shadows

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
because we've added Blues of the shadows

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.230 
because we've added Blues of the shadows
it<00:04:37.050> picks<00:04:37.440> up<00:04:37.590> that<00:04:37.740> blue<00:04:38.010> tint<00:04:38.340> so<00:04:39.060> it<00:04:39.120> has

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
it picks up that blue tint so it has

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.629 
it picks up that blue tint so it has
kind<00:04:39.419> of<00:04:39.450> a<00:04:39.540> really<00:04:39.750> nice<00:04:39.840> faded<00:04:40.260> look<00:04:40.639> next

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
kind of a really nice faded look next

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:42.800 
kind of a really nice faded look next
we're<00:04:41.760> going<00:04:41.850> to<00:04:41.940> add<00:04:42.030> a<00:04:42.060> midpoint<00:04:42.300> right<00:04:42.600> here

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
we're going to add a midpoint right here

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.330 
we're going to add a midpoint right here
and<00:04:42.930> pull<00:04:43.169> up<00:04:43.290> the<00:04:43.440> overall<00:04:43.800> brightness<00:04:44.070> of

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
and pull up the overall brightness of

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.100 
and pull up the overall brightness of
the<00:04:44.400> image<00:04:44.660> then<00:04:45.660> we're<00:04:45.780> gonna<00:04:45.870> add<00:04:46.080> a

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
the image then we're gonna add a

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.870 
the image then we're gonna add a
highlight<00:04:46.620> point<00:04:46.860> and<00:04:47.160> pull<00:04:47.340> down<00:04:47.490> our<00:04:47.639> whites

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
highlight point and pull down our whites

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.170 
highlight point and pull down our whites
so<00:04:48.240> we<00:04:48.330> can<00:04:48.450> kill<00:04:48.720> some<00:04:48.750> of<00:04:48.960> that<00:04:49.080> contrast

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
so we can kill some of that contrast

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.340 
so we can kill some of that contrast
alright<00:04:51.180> guys<00:04:51.330> so<00:04:51.450> now<00:04:51.479> we<00:04:51.630> have<00:04:51.900> this<00:04:52.080> kind<00:04:52.290> of

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
alright guys so now we have this kind of

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.350 
alright guys so now we have this kind of
cool<00:04:52.560> faded<00:04:53.070> vintage<00:04:53.370> look<00:04:53.610> to<00:04:53.700> the<00:04:53.789> image<00:04:53.910> and

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
cool faded vintage look to the image and

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.150 
cool faded vintage look to the image and
now<00:04:54.870> we<00:04:54.930> just<00:04:55.140> got<00:04:55.260> to<00:04:55.350> finish<00:04:55.530> it<00:04:55.800> by<00:04:55.950> adding

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
now we just got to finish it by adding

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.880 
now we just got to finish it by adding
in<00:04:56.460> some<00:04:56.880> detail<00:04:57.240> or<00:04:57.900> some<00:04:58.140> effects<00:04:58.440> basically

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
in some detail or some effects basically

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.640 
in some detail or some effects basically
so<00:04:59.550> let's<00:04:59.729> go<00:04:59.850> down<00:05:00.060> to<00:05:00.090> our<00:05:00.440> effects<00:05:01.440> panel

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
so let's go down to our effects panel

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.409 
so let's go down to our effects panel
we're<00:05:01.860> gonna<00:05:01.950> go<00:05:02.160> hit<00:05:02.400> control<00:05:02.760> seven<00:05:03.210> and

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
we're gonna go hit control seven and

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:06.409 
we're gonna go hit control seven and
then<00:05:04.140> we're<00:05:04.260> gonna<00:05:04.350> load<00:05:05.220> up<00:05:05.280> on<00:05:05.580> the<00:05:05.700> grain<00:05:05.940> to

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
then we're gonna load up on the grain to

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.630 
then we're gonna load up on the grain to
about<00:05:06.690> plus<00:05:07.200> 60<00:05:07.710> maybe<00:05:07.950> plus<00:05:08.250> eighty

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
about plus 60 maybe plus eighty

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.850 
about plus 60 maybe plus eighty
somewhere<00:05:09.240> around<00:05:09.300> this<00:05:09.479> range<00:05:09.690> I'm<00:05:10.410> gonna

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
somewhere around this range I'm gonna

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.310 
somewhere around this range I'm gonna
add<00:05:11.010> a<00:05:11.039> little<00:05:11.250> bit<00:05:11.370> to<00:05:11.400> my<00:05:11.520> size<00:05:11.789> and<00:05:12.320> let's

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
add a little bit to my size and let's

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.020 
add a little bit to my size and let's
zoom<00:05:13.410> in<00:05:13.710> and<00:05:13.860> check<00:05:13.979> it<00:05:14.010> out<00:05:14.220> the<00:05:14.550> larger<00:05:14.910> our

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
zoom in and check it out the larger our

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.550 
zoom in and check it out the larger our
size<00:05:15.270> is<00:05:15.510> the<00:05:15.780> more<00:05:15.990> of<00:05:16.110> the<00:05:16.200> detail<00:05:16.470> we're

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
size is the more of the detail we're

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.710 
size is the more of the detail we're
gonna<00:05:16.650> kill<00:05:16.950> the<00:05:17.700> smaller<00:05:18.000> the<00:05:18.150> size<00:05:18.330> the

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
gonna kill the smaller the size the

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.969 
gonna kill the smaller the size the
finer<00:05:18.960> the<00:05:19.110> grain<00:05:19.320> and<00:05:19.410> the<00:05:19.500> more<00:05:19.650> detail<00:05:19.919> we

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979 
finer the grain and the more detail we

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:21.710 
finer the grain and the more detail we
preserve<00:05:20.340> so<00:05:21.000> we<00:05:21.060> wanted<00:05:21.270> to<00:05:21.330> kind<00:05:21.419> of<00:05:21.539> have<00:05:21.660> a

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
preserve so we wanted to kind of have a

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.300 
preserve so we wanted to kind of have a
realistic<00:05:22.080> feel<00:05:22.289> to<00:05:22.680> it<00:05:22.800> and<00:05:22.979> right<00:05:23.100> about

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
realistic feel to it and right about

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.890 
realistic feel to it and right about
here<00:05:23.370> looks<00:05:23.789> pretty<00:05:23.970> good<00:05:24.180> let's<00:05:24.539> see<00:05:24.750> if<00:05:24.810> we

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
here looks pretty good let's see if we

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.200 
here looks pretty good let's see if we
want<00:05:24.990> to<00:05:25.110> go<00:05:25.260> any<00:05:25.410> higher<00:05:25.500> I<00:05:26.030> like<00:05:27.030> it<00:05:27.120> about

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
want to go any higher I like it about

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.250 
want to go any higher I like it about
seventy<00:05:27.930> amount<00:05:28.260> about<00:05:28.800> 35<00:05:29.370> for<00:05:29.789> the<00:05:30.210> size<00:05:30.450> and

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
seventy amount about 35 for the size and

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.330 
seventy amount about 35 for the size and
let's<00:05:31.530> see<00:05:31.650> if<00:05:31.680> we<00:05:31.770> want<00:05:31.890> it<00:05:32.039> to<00:05:32.100> be<00:05:32.160> a<00:05:32.190> little

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
let's see if we want it to be a little

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.279 
let's see if we want it to be a little
bit<00:05:32.490> more<00:05:32.610> rough<00:05:32.970> I'd<00:05:33.210> like<00:05:33.360> it<00:05:33.390> about<00:05:33.600> plus<00:05:33.870> 60

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:34.289 
bit more rough I'd like it about plus 60

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:36.320 
bit more rough I'd like it about plus 60
for<00:05:34.440> the<00:05:34.530> roughness<00:05:34.860> this<00:05:35.610> is<00:05:35.729> again<00:05:36.000> really

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
for the roughness this is again really

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:37.850 
for the roughness this is again really
stylistic<00:05:37.020> so<00:05:37.140> you<00:05:37.200> guys<00:05:37.350> pick<00:05:37.590> what<00:05:37.770> works

6 on a Mac and again if in vintage
photos<00:05:49.440> are<00:05:49.620> often<00:05:49.979> vignette<00:05:50.370> it<00:05:50.520> they<00:05:51.000> came

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
photos are often vignette it they came

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.580 
photos are often vignette it they came
from<00:05:51.330> older<00:05:51.630> cameras<00:05:51.960> that<00:05:52.050> had<00:05:52.169> vignette<00:05:52.470> at

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
from older cameras that had vignette at

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:53.930 
from older cameras that had vignette at
edges<00:05:52.860> and<00:05:52.950> so<00:05:53.039> we're<00:05:53.160> gonna<00:05:53.220> replicate<00:05:53.460> that

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
edges and so we're gonna replicate that

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.060 
edges and so we're gonna replicate that
by<00:05:54.090> just<00:05:54.270> pulling<00:05:54.660> in<00:05:54.810> a<00:05:55.020> lens<00:05:55.680> correction

by just pulling in a lens correction

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:57.380 
by just pulling in a lens correction
vignette<00:05:56.370> again<00:05:56.669> I<00:05:56.700> don't<00:05:56.820> like<00:05:57.030> using<00:05:57.240> a

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
vignette again I don't like using a

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.120 
vignette again I don't like using a
standard<00:05:57.690> you<00:05:58.260> know<00:05:58.380> post<00:05:58.560> crop<00:05:58.770> vignette<00:05:59.070> in

because<00:05:59.280> it's<00:05:59.370> a<00:05:59.430> little<00:05:59.580> bit<00:05:59.669> too<00:05:59.760> strong<00:05:59.840> so

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
because it's a little bit too strong so

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:01.730 
because it's a little bit too strong so
I'm<00:06:00.900> just<00:06:00.990> gonna<00:06:01.140> pull<00:06:01.320> in<00:06:01.440> this<00:06:01.500> midpoint

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
I'm just gonna pull in this midpoint

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:02.780 
I'm just gonna pull in this midpoint
about<00:06:02.430> negative

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
about negative

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.730 
about negative
49<00:06:03.150> and<00:06:03.330> 11<00:06:03.720> for<00:06:03.870> the<00:06:03.930> midpoint<00:06:04.260> looks<00:06:04.440> good<00:06:04.650> to

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
49 and 11 for the midpoint looks good to

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.110 
49 and 11 for the midpoint looks good to
me<00:06:04.770> and<00:06:05.130> now<00:06:06.000> let's<00:06:06.240> go<00:06:06.360> back<00:06:06.630> up<00:06:06.870> to<00:06:06.900> the<00:06:07.170> basic

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 
me and now let's go back up to the basic

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.340 
me and now let's go back up to the basic
we're<00:06:09.120> gonna<00:06:09.210> subtract<00:06:09.690> out<00:06:09.840> a<00:06:09.870> little<00:06:10.110> bit<00:06:10.260> of

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.350 
we're gonna subtract out a little bit of

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.750 
we're gonna subtract out a little bit of
vibrance<00:06:10.680> just<00:06:10.920> so<00:06:10.980> we<00:06:11.100> see<00:06:11.280> a<00:06:11.310> little<00:06:11.640> bit

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.760 
vibrance just so we see a little bit

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.210 
vibrance just so we see a little bit
more<00:06:11.880> of<00:06:12.330> that<00:06:12.650> underlying<00:06:13.650> kind<00:06:13.890> of<00:06:14.010> cross

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 
more of that underlying kind of cross

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.160 
more of that underlying kind of cross
process<00:06:14.610> look<00:06:14.880> at<00:06:15.090> this<00:06:15.690> point<00:06:15.900> if<00:06:15.990> you<00:06:16.080> guys

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:16.170 
process look at this point if you guys

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:17.270 
process look at this point if you guys
want<00:06:16.470> to

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 
want to

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.650 
want to
oh<00:06:17.310> and<00:06:17.760> what<00:06:17.940> I'm<00:06:18.030> gonna<00:06:18.120> do<00:06:18.270> also<00:06:18.420> is<00:06:18.630> just

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 
oh and what I'm gonna do also is just

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.300 
oh and what I'm gonna do also is just
add<00:06:18.930> a<00:06:18.960> little<00:06:19.080> bit<00:06:19.200> of<00:06:19.290> saturation<00:06:20.010> to<00:06:20.100> it<00:06:20.190> so

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:20.310 
add a little bit of saturation to it so

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:21.950 
add a little bit of saturation to it so
it's<00:06:20.400> kind<00:06:20.520> of<00:06:20.550> amplifying<00:06:21.090> the<00:06:21.780> cross

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 
it's kind of amplifying the cross

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.930 
it's kind of amplifying the cross
processing<00:06:22.440> so<00:06:23.280> remember<00:06:23.550> in<00:06:23.610> the<00:06:23.640> previous

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:23.940 
processing so remember in the previous

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:24.830 
processing so remember in the previous
story<00:06:24.060> when<00:06:24.210> we<00:06:24.270> talked<00:06:24.420> about<00:06:24.510> how<00:06:24.660> you<00:06:24.720> could

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 
story when we talked about how you could

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.360 
story when we talked about how you could
pull<00:06:25.080> down<00:06:25.230> the<00:06:25.350> vibrance<00:06:25.740> and<00:06:25.950> add<00:06:26.130> to<00:06:26.280> the

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
pull down the vibrance and add to the

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:27.670 
pull down the vibrance and add to the
saturation<00:06:26.790> to<00:06:27.000> kind<00:06:27.180> of<00:06:27.270> create<00:06:27.540> that

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680 
saturation to kind of create that

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.860 
saturation to kind of create that
reverse<00:06:28.820> coloring<00:06:29.820> type<00:06:29.970> of<00:06:30.090> look<00:06:30.180> to<00:06:30.240> it<00:06:30.390> so

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870 
reverse coloring type of look to it so

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.600 
reverse coloring type of look to it so
that's<00:06:30.990> what<00:06:31.110> we're<00:06:31.200> doing<00:06:31.410> here<00:06:31.590> we'll<00:06:32.490> go

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:32.610 
that's what we're doing here we'll go

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:33.980 
that's what we're doing here we'll go
back<00:06:32.730> to<00:06:32.820> our<00:06:32.940> tone<00:06:33.120> curve<00:06:33.330> panel<00:06:33.690> we'll

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:33.990 
back to our tone curve panel we'll

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.690 
back to our tone curve panel we'll
adjust<00:06:34.260> it<00:06:34.440> just<00:06:34.470> a<00:06:34.680> tiny<00:06:34.830> bit<00:06:35.070> to<00:06:35.280> see<00:06:35.430> if<00:06:35.460> we

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:35.700 
adjust it just a tiny bit to see if we

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.030 
adjust it just a tiny bit to see if we
want<00:06:36.120> any<00:06:36.240> additional<00:06:36.840> colors<00:06:37.200> what<00:06:37.770> I<00:06:37.800> would

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:38.040 
want any additional colors what I would

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.500 
want any additional colors what I would
like<00:06:38.220> is<00:06:38.430> a<00:06:38.460> little<00:06:38.640> bit<00:06:38.730> more<00:06:38.820> greens<00:06:39.180> in<00:06:39.480> my

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:39.510 
like is a little bit more greens in my

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:40.970 
like is a little bit more greens in my
highlights<00:06:40.050> so<00:06:40.410> I'm<00:06:40.470> gonna<00:06:40.590> pull<00:06:40.800> up<00:06:40.890> the

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:40.980 
highlights so I'm gonna pull up the

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.130 
highlights so I'm gonna pull up the
green<00:06:41.190> just<00:06:41.340> a<00:06:41.460> little<00:06:41.670> bit<00:06:41.790> just<00:06:42.630> so<00:06:42.720> my<00:06:42.840> sky

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:43.140 
green just a little bit just so my sky

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:44.720 
green just a little bit just so my sky
goes<00:06:43.380> to<00:06:43.500> like<00:06:43.650> that<00:06:43.800> nice<00:06:44.040> kind<00:06:44.340> of<00:06:44.430> faded

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:44.730 
goes to like that nice kind of faded

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:47.390 
goes to like that nice kind of faded
vintage<00:06:45.030> green<00:06:45.350> I'd<00:06:46.350> also<00:06:46.500> like<00:06:46.800> let's<00:06:47.190> see<00:06:47.370> a

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:47.400 
vintage green I'd also like let's see a

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.310 
vintage green I'd also like let's see a
little<00:06:47.730> bit<00:06:47.880> more<00:06:47.940> blues<00:06:48.390> in<00:06:48.660> the<00:06:48.690> shadows<00:06:49.110> and

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:49.320 
little bit more blues in the shadows and

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.450 
little bit more blues in the shadows and
kind<00:06:49.500> of<00:06:49.560> the<00:06:49.620> deeper<00:06:49.890> shadows<00:06:50.220> so<00:06:50.280> I'm<00:06:50.340> gonna

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.460 
kind of the deeper shadows so I'm gonna

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.910 
kind of the deeper shadows so I'm gonna
pull<00:06:50.670> it<00:06:50.790> down<00:06:50.940> just<00:06:51.090> a<00:06:51.180> tiny<00:06:51.330> bit<00:06:51.540> and<00:06:52.350> just

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:52.920 
pull it down just a tiny bit and just

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.100 
pull it down just a tiny bit and just
bring<00:06:53.160> it<00:06:53.280> about<00:06:53.640> there<00:06:54.000> and<00:06:54.900> that<00:06:55.020> looks

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:55.110 
bring it about there and that looks

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:56.780
