sketches<00:01:57.990> as<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:58.680> can<00:01:58.860> stand<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.460> very<00:02:00.299> rarely

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
sketches as you can stand I very rarely

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.530 
sketches as you can stand I very rarely
use<00:02:00.990> my<00:02:01.170> first<00:02:01.380> sketch<00:02:01.820> or<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.180> second

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
use my first sketch or the second

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.929 
use my first sketch or the second
usually<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.350> do<00:02:04.469> about<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.829> dozen<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:05.520> kind<00:02:05.820> of

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
usually I do about a dozen and I kind of

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.510 
usually I do about a dozen and I kind of
mix<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.360> match<00:02:06.890> it's<00:02:07.890> important<00:02:08.399> to

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
mix and match it's important to

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.150 
mix and match it's important to
brainstorm<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.360> get<00:02:10.200> all<00:02:10.319> of<00:02:10.440> your<00:02:10.530> ideas<00:02:10.920> on

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
brainstorm and get all of your ideas on

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.280 
brainstorm and get all of your ideas on
paper<00:02:11.370> as<00:02:11.790> quickly<00:02:12.150> as<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:12.569> can

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
paper as quickly as you can

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.229 
paper as quickly as you can
don't<00:02:13.439> waste<00:02:13.620> any<00:02:13.860> time<00:02:13.950> on<00:02:14.159> detail<00:02:14.939> and<00:02:15.180> all

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
don't waste any time on detail and all

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.599 
don't waste any time on detail and all
that<00:02:15.360> kind<00:02:15.540> of<00:02:15.569> crap<00:02:15.629> and<00:02:16.219> then<00:02:17.219> you<00:02:17.370> evaluate

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:17.609 
that kind of crap and then you evaluate

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:20.599 
that kind of crap and then you evaluate
what's<00:02:18.299> working<00:02:18.629> and<00:02:18.959> what's<00:02:19.170> not<00:02:19.260> in<00:02:19.980> each<00:02:20.370> of

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:20.609 
what's working and what's not in each of

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:23.449 
what's working and what's not in each of
your<00:02:20.700> little<00:02:20.909> scribbles<00:02:21.329> and<00:02:22.250> combine<00:02:23.250> all

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
your little scribbles and combine all

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.000 
your little scribbles and combine all
the<00:02:23.609> strengths<00:02:24.209> in<00:02:24.450> that<00:02:24.900> really<00:02:25.409> rough<00:02:25.650> stage

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
the strengths in that really rough stage

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.270 
the strengths in that really rough stage
before<00:02:26.670> you<00:02:27.209> start<00:02:27.510> drawing<00:02:27.870> and<00:02:28.230> long<00:02:28.799> before

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
before you start drawing and long before

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.009 
before you start drawing and long before
you<00:02:29.400> start<00:02:29.700> rendering<00:02:30.120> you've<00:02:30.750> heard<00:02:30.870> this

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
you start rendering you've heard this

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.530 
you start rendering you've heard this
before<00:02:31.079> but<00:02:31.409> it<00:02:31.920> bears<00:02:32.010> repeating<00:02:32.540> good

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
before but it bears repeating good

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.770 
before but it bears repeating good
paintings<00:02:34.079> come<00:02:34.590> from<00:02:34.829> good<00:02:35.040> drawings<00:02:35.780> now

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
paintings come from good drawings now

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.479 
paintings come from good drawings now
those<00:02:37.170> of<00:02:37.319> you<00:02:37.409> who<00:02:37.590> watch<00:02:37.739> mythbusters<00:02:38.459> will

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
those of you who watch mythbusters will

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.309 
those of you who watch mythbusters will
argue<00:02:39.120> that<00:02:39.359> you<00:02:39.689> can<00:02:39.989> indeed<00:02:40.409> polish<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.430> turd

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
argue that you can indeed polish a turd

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.020 
argue that you can indeed polish a turd
but<00:02:43.319> seriously<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:44.040> work<00:02:44.219> you<00:02:44.370> do<00:02:44.489> before<00:02:44.790> you

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
but seriously the work you do before you

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.210 
but seriously the work you do before you
start<00:02:45.359> painting<00:02:45.750> is<00:02:45.870> way<00:02:46.530> more<00:02:46.739> important

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
start painting is way more important

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.280 
start painting is way more important
than<00:02:47.280> anything<00:02:47.579> else<00:02:50.959> unfortunately<00:02:51.959> because

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
than anything else unfortunately because

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.429 
than anything else unfortunately because
this<00:02:52.319> piece<00:02:52.799> is<00:02:53.040> a<00:02:53.069> little<00:02:53.819> bit<00:02:53.970> old<00:02:54.209> I<00:02:54.540> could

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:55.439 
this piece is a little bit old I could

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:57.619 
this piece is a little bit old I could
only<00:02:55.560> dig<00:02:55.829> up<00:02:55.980> two<00:02:56.280> of<00:02:56.669> the<00:02:57.000> sketches<00:02:57.419> that<00:02:57.450> I

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
only dig up two of the sketches that I

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:01.909 
only dig up two of the sketches that I
did<00:02:58.819> this<00:02:59.819> first<00:03:00.120> one<00:03:00.359> has<00:03:00.750> some<00:03:01.200> dynamic

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:01.919 
did this first one has some dynamic

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:03.530 
did this first one has some dynamic
stuff<00:03:02.129> going<00:03:02.400> on<00:03:02.489> but<00:03:02.760> it<00:03:03.150> looked<00:03:03.329> a<00:03:03.389> little

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
stuff going on but it looked a little

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.539 
stuff going on but it looked a little
bit<00:03:03.689> too<00:03:03.840> much<00:03:03.989> like<00:03:04.260> she<00:03:04.650> could<00:03:04.799> be<00:03:04.889> falling

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
bit too much like she could be falling

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.390 
bit too much like she could be falling
or<00:03:05.819> being<00:03:06.629> dragged<00:03:07.049> down<00:03:07.260> by<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.739> forest<00:03:08.189> and

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
or being dragged down by the forest and

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.119 
or being dragged down by the forest and
I<00:03:09.269> felt<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:10.049> composition<00:03:10.620> was<00:03:10.769> a<00:03:10.799> little<00:03:11.010> too

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
I felt the composition was a little too

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.929 
I felt the composition was a little too
centralized<00:03:12.230> this<00:03:13.230> next<00:03:13.829> one<00:03:14.040> it<00:03:14.639> could<00:03:14.819> have

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:14.939 
centralized this next one it could have

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:16.429 
centralized this next one it could have
been<00:03:15.030> fun<00:03:15.269> because<00:03:15.599> the<00:03:15.720> amount<00:03:15.870> of<00:03:15.989> detail<00:03:16.409> I

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:16.439 
been fun because the amount of detail I

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:18.170 
been fun because the amount of detail I
could<00:03:16.739> have<00:03:16.829> put<00:03:17.010> into<00:03:17.159> like<00:03:17.609> makeup<00:03:17.879> and

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
could have put into like makeup and

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.629 
could have put into like makeup and
trinkets<00:03:18.629> and<00:03:18.780> things<00:03:18.900> like<00:03:19.079> that<00:03:19.139> but<00:03:19.639> much

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639 
trinkets and things like that but much

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:23.809 
trinkets and things like that but much
of<00:03:20.669> the<00:03:20.849> suggestion<00:03:21.690> of<00:03:21.720> flight<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:22.859> magic

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
of the suggestion of flight and magic

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.149 
of the suggestion of flight and magic
use<00:03:24.030> would<00:03:24.239> be<00:03:24.269> lost<00:03:24.569> I<00:03:24.930> felt<00:03:25.650> that<00:03:25.799> this<00:03:25.919> pose

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 
use would be lost I felt that this pose

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:28.490 
use would be lost I felt that this pose
would<00:03:26.370> work<00:03:26.549> well<00:03:26.729> I<00:03:26.970> knew<00:03:27.540> that<00:03:27.569> with<00:03:27.840> the

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
would work well I knew that with the

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.800 
would work well I knew that with the
vines<00:03:28.799> and<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.340> jungle<00:03:29.699> actually<00:03:30.329> touching

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
vines and the jungle actually touching

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.080 
vines and the jungle actually touching
her<00:03:30.989> it<00:03:31.349> would<00:03:31.530> be<00:03:31.680> more<00:03:32.040> likely<00:03:32.310> to<00:03:32.489> visually

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
her it would be more likely to visually

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.119 
her it would be more likely to visually
anchor<00:03:33.540> her<00:03:33.720> to<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:33.959> ground<00:03:34.199> rather<00:03:34.979> than

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
anchor her to the ground rather than

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.849 
anchor her to the ground rather than
convey<00:03:36.120> that<00:03:36.269> it's<00:03:36.419> lifting<00:03:36.989> her<00:03:37.260> so<00:03:37.799> to

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
convey that it's lifting her so to

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.770 
convey that it's lifting her so to
counteract<00:03:38.190> that<00:03:38.609> as<00:03:38.849> much<00:03:39.030> as<00:03:39.150> I<00:03:39.239> could<00:03:39.299> I

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
counteract that as much as I could I

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.369 
counteract that as much as I could I
went<00:03:39.989> with<00:03:40.079> a<00:03:40.109> really<00:03:40.590> classic<00:03:40.979> flying<00:03:41.639> pose

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:42.379 
went with a really classic flying pose

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:44.780 
went with a really classic flying pose
the<00:03:43.379> next<00:03:43.709> most<00:03:43.859> important<00:03:44.370> thing<00:03:44.579> was<00:03:44.729> to

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
the next most important thing was to

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.689 
the next most important thing was to
create<00:03:45.120> a<00:03:45.299> flow<00:03:45.780> in<00:03:46.079> the<00:03:46.199> vines<00:03:46.440> around<00:03:46.709> her<00:03:47.099> so

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:47.699 
create a flow in the vines around her so

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:49.670 
create a flow in the vines around her so
they<00:03:47.849> looked<00:03:48.329> like<00:03:48.389> they<00:03:48.540> were<00:03:48.720> lifting<00:03:49.409> and

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
they looked like they were lifting and

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.039 
they looked like they were lifting and
reaching<00:03:49.889> out<00:03:50.419> now<00:03:51.419> with<00:03:51.629> those<00:03:51.810> things

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
reaching out now with those things

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.960 
reaching out now with those things
address<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.919> next<00:03:53.370> thing<00:03:53.549> would<00:03:53.669> be<00:03:53.819> to<00:03:53.940> put

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
address the next thing would be to put

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.280 
address the next thing would be to put
some<00:03:54.239> clothes<00:03:54.449> on<00:03:54.599> her<00:03:54.720> Magic<00:03:55.139> the<00:03:55.260> Gathering

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
composition for example I had already

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.600 
composition for example I had already
intended<00:04:32.060> to<00:04:32.150> give<00:04:32.300> her<00:04:32.419> a<00:04:32.480> crown<00:04:32.810> or<00:04:33.110> tiara

intended to give her a crown or tiara

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.250 
intended to give her a crown or tiara
but<00:04:34.610> seeing<00:04:35.030> how<00:04:35.150> much<00:04:35.270> volume<00:04:35.540> her<00:04:35.900> hair<00:04:36.139> was

but seeing how much volume her hair was

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.960 
but seeing how much volume her hair was
going<00:04:36.440> to<00:04:36.500> take<00:04:36.650> up<00:04:36.860> in<00:04:36.980> the<00:04:37.100> scene<00:04:37.310> I<00:04:37.520> decided

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
going to take up in the scene I decided

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.610 
going to take up in the scene I decided
something<00:04:38.480> needed<00:04:38.630> to<00:04:38.840> break<00:04:39.110> up<00:04:39.320> all<00:04:39.500> that

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
something needed to break up all that

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.629 
something needed to break up all that
space<00:04:39.850> so<00:04:40.850> a<00:04:41.270> basic<00:04:41.870> crown<00:04:42.290> evolved<00:04:43.010> into<00:04:43.370> that

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
space so a basic crown evolved into that

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:45.400 
space so a basic crown evolved into that
long<00:04:43.910> headdress<00:04:44.389> of<00:04:44.600> floaty<00:04:44.840> rocks<00:04:45.169> or

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
long headdress of floaty rocks or

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.010 
long headdress of floaty rocks or
whatever<00:04:45.889> and<00:04:46.130> I<00:04:46.820> gave<00:04:47.030> her<00:04:47.180> necklaces<00:04:47.750> and

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
whatever and I gave her necklaces and

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.840 
whatever and I gave her necklaces and
little<00:04:48.200> bangle<00:04:48.620> things<00:04:48.919> all<00:04:49.400> over<00:04:49.430> the<00:04:49.669> place

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
little bangle things all over the place

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.000 
little bangle things all over the place
so<00:04:50.060> that<00:04:50.180> there<00:04:50.360> was<00:04:50.510> so<00:04:51.320> there<00:04:51.500> was<00:04:51.620> more<00:04:51.860> to

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
so that there was so there was more to

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.370 
so that there was so there was more to
reiterate<00:04:52.250> that<00:04:52.490> feeling<00:04:53.120> of<00:04:53.210> movement<00:04:53.419> I<00:04:53.870> had

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
reiterate that feeling of movement I had

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.570

these<00:04:54.970> floating<00:04:55.970> bone<00:04:56.750> dagger<00:04:57.139> II<00:04:57.290> things<00:04:57.680> but

these floating bone dagger II things but

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.159 
these floating bone dagger II things but
in<00:04:58.880> the<00:04:58.970> end<00:04:59.000> I<00:04:59.210> thought<00:04:59.419> this<00:04:59.600> was<00:04:59.750> already<00:05:00.110> a

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
in the end I thought this was already a

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:02.500 
in the end I thought this was already a
really<00:05:00.440> busy<00:05:00.770> piece<00:05:01.160> and<00:05:01.490> it<00:05:01.970> didn't<00:05:02.270> need<00:05:02.330> any

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
really busy piece and it didn't need any

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.810 
really busy piece and it didn't need any

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
things start to move around when you add

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.529 
things start to move around when you add
them<00:05:42.289> and<00:05:42.530> just<00:05:43.520> like<00:05:43.669> your<00:05:43.850> drawing<00:05:44.120> you<00:05:44.419> need

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:44.539 
them and just like your drawing you need

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:46.270 
them and just like your drawing you need
to<00:05:44.630> have<00:05:44.780> everything<00:05:45.080> worked<00:05:45.440> out<00:05:45.590> before<00:05:45.890> you

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
to have everything worked out before you

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.029 
to have everything worked out before you
get<00:05:46.430> to<00:05:46.550> that<00:05:46.580> tedious<00:05:47.090> rendering<00:05:47.630> bit

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:48.039 
get to that tedious rendering bit

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:50.620 
get to that tedious rendering bit
consider<00:05:49.039> your<00:05:49.220> light<00:05:49.370> sources<00:05:49.880> the<00:05:50.419> light

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
consider your light sources the light

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:51.940 
consider your light sources the light
source<00:05:50.870> is<00:05:51.080> what<00:05:51.229> will<00:05:51.350> give<00:05:51.470> your<00:05:51.560> piece<00:05:51.770> of

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:51.950 
source is what will give your piece of

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.890 
source is what will give your piece of
certain<00:05:52.190> mood<00:05:52.490> and<00:05:52.940> it's<00:05:53.120> what<00:05:53.389> describes

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
certain mood and it's what describes

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.070 
certain mood and it's what describes
volume<00:05:54.650> and<00:05:54.919> shape<00:05:55.190> an<00:05:55.990> understanding<00:05:56.990> of

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
volume and shape an understanding of

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.390 
volume and shape an understanding of
light<00:05:57.350> is<00:05:57.560> going<00:05:57.800> to<00:05:58.010> make<00:05:58.160> all<00:05:58.340> the

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 
light is going to make all the

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.340 
light is going to make all the
difference<00:05:59.030> when<00:05:59.450> you<00:05:59.570> get<00:05:59.750> to<00:05:59.870> the<00:05:59.990> painting

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.350 
difference when you get to the painting

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.310 
difference when you get to the painting
stage<00:06:01.030> okay<00:06:02.030> so<00:06:02.389> a<00:06:02.419> lot<00:06:02.600> of<00:06:02.630> that<00:06:02.870> probably

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:03.320 
stage okay so a lot of that probably

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.279 
stage okay so a lot of that probably
isn't<00:06:03.560> new<00:06:03.830> to<00:06:04.039> you<00:06:04.220> the<00:06:04.850> foundations<00:06:05.630> they're

isn't new to you the foundations they're

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:09.129 
isn't new to you the foundations they're
extremely<00:06:06.620> important<00:06:07.220> and<00:06:07.870> I'll<00:06:08.870> be<00:06:09.020> the

extremely important and I'll be the
first<00:06:09.169> to<00:06:09.440> admit<00:06:09.530> they're<00:06:10.039> not<00:06:10.280> my<00:06:10.430> strong

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:10.729
