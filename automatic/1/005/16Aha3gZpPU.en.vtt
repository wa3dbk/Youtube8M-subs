the spectator to think of a number

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.380 
the spectator to think of a number
between<00:00:18.539> 10<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.230> 20<00:00:19.830> that<00:00:20.460> means<00:00:20.520> any<00:00:21.210> number

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
between 10 and 20 that means any number

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.070 
between 10 and 20 that means any number
between<00:00:21.750> 11<00:00:22.500> through<00:00:22.920> 1910<00:00:23.820> actually<00:00:24.810> works

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
between 11 through 1910 actually works

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.779 
between 11 through 1910 actually works
but<00:00:25.859> we'll<00:00:26.010> say<00:00:26.189> think<00:00:26.430> of<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.580> number<00:00:26.670> between

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
but we'll say think of a number between

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.939 
but we'll say think of a number between
10<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.269> 20<00:00:27.689> let's<00:00:28.320> say<00:00:28.470> they<00:00:28.560> think<00:00:28.769> of<00:00:28.859> the

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
them to add the two digits together so

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.929 
them to add the two digits together so
12<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.060> 1<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.570> 2<00:01:21.600> 1<00:01:22.409> plus<00:01:22.650> 2<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:23.009> 3<00:01:23.040> count

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
12 is a 1 and a 2 1 plus 2 is 3 count

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.230 
12 is a 1 and a 2 1 plus 2 is 3 count
down<00:01:24.119> 3<00:01:24.390> cards<00:01:24.810> 1<00:01:25.080> 2<00:01:25.470> 3<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.400> next<00:01:26.610> card<00:01:26.939> show

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
down 3 cards 1 2 3 the next card show

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.510 
down 3 cards 1 2 3 the next card show
them<00:01:27.420> as<00:01:27.540> their<00:01:27.689> card<00:01:27.990> we're<00:01:28.530> not<00:01:28.710> looking<00:01:29.040> but

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
them as their card we're not looking but

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.550 
them as their card we're not looking but
we<00:01:29.549> know<00:01:29.820> it's<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.210> ace<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.509> hearts<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:31.290> works

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
we know it's the ace of hearts it works

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.219 
we know it's the ace of hearts it works
every<00:01:31.920> time<00:01:32.130> because<00:01:32.579> number<00:01:33.360> 10<00:01:33.900> is<00:01:34.259> 1<00:01:35.189> plus<00:01:35.729> 0

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
every time because number 10 is 1 plus 0

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.300 
every time because number 10 is 1 plus 0
so<00:01:37.229> that's<00:01:37.560> 1<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.310> 10<00:01:38.520> minus<00:01:38.820> 1<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:39.030> 9<00:01:39.259> 11<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.439> 1

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
so that's 1 so 10 minus 1 is 9 11 is 1

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.530 
so that's 1 so 10 minus 1 is 9 11 is 1
plus<00:01:41.520> 1<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:42.030> 2<00:01:42.060> 11<00:01:42.899> minus<00:01:43.200> 2<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.500> 9<00:01:43.680> 12<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.729> 1<00:01:45.149> &amp;<00:01:45.360> 2

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
plus 1 is 2 11 minus 2 is 9 12 is 1 &amp; 2

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.780 
plus 1 is 2 11 minus 2 is 9 12 is 1 &amp; 2
is<00:01:45.750> 3<00:01:45.960> 12<00:01:46.470> minus<00:01:46.829> 3<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:47.070> 9<00:01:47.420> 16<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.720> 1<00:01:48.990> plus<00:01:49.229> 6<00:01:49.470> is<00:01:49.649> 7

16<00:01:50.790> minus<00:01:51.119> 7<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:51.540> 9<00:01:51.770> so<00:01:52.770> all<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.130> numbers

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
16 minus 7 is 9 so all the numbers

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.060 
16 minus 7 is 9 so all the numbers
between<00:01:53.579> 10<00:01:54.090> through<00:01:54.479> 19<00:01:54.509> if<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.680> take<00:01:55.920> the

between 10 through 19 if you take the

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.980 
between 10 through 19 if you take the
number<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.640> add<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.180> two<00:01:57.329> digits<00:01:57.360> together

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
number and add the two digits together

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.999 
number and add the two digits together
and<00:01:58.290> count<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:59.009> down<00:01:59.159> 1<00:01:59.520> 2<00:01:59.759> 3<00:02:00.000> 4<00:02:00.299> 5<00:02:00.570> 6<00:02:00.930> 7<00:02:01.140> 8<00:02:01.409> 9<00:02:01.740> 10
