00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.919
 and one day it came time to me 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.469
 the usual whole ceremony is more 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.860

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.960
 petition about marriage wish them happiness and here 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.410
 here looking at young people I understood 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.500
 that something is not intuition prompted 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.010
 ex asked if they love each other they 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.320
 answered yes of course very much and then 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.920
 I asked them a question that never again 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.290
 nobody asked very scary 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.640
 question 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.040
 appealing to young man and russian 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:44.010
 The following imagine just such a 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:46.410
 the picture you entered marriage went to your 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.879
 honeymoon and crashed on 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:54.480
 car and she was now not that beautiful 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:57.320
 the girl who you see in front of her 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.320
 became disabled 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:04.650

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.610

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.650
 and by reaction I understood 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.850
 I realized that he would not be able to 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.830
 love this girl if she 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.600

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.780

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.960

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:37.660

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.950

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:15.810
 rejoices in wrong and rejoices in the truth 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:21.060

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:22.980
