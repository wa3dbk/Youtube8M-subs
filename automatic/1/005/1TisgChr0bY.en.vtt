00:00:12.876 --> 00:00:15.876
 These are dark times, which cannot be doubted 

00:00:17.319 --> 00:00:19.032
 Harry .. Where is he? 

00:00:21.583 --> 00:00:25.693
 Our world has not known any greater danger than today 

00:00:28.805 --> 00:00:32.845
 But you can't win this war alone, Mr. Potter. 

00:00:38.994 --> 00:00:40.658
 He's too strong. 

00:00:45.825 --> 00:00:48.042
 We have infiltrated the ministry. 

00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:51.136
 You have nothing to fear when you have nothing to hide. 

00:00:52.281 --> 00:00:54.793
 The longer we stay here, the stronger he gets. 

00:00:56.062 --> 00:00:59.062
 I have to be the one who kills Harry Potter. 

00:01:01.767 --> 00:01:03.353
 Anyway from the street to something safer. 

00:01:03.598 --> 00:01:05.759
 They have to go undercover before someone kills them. 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.003
 This way they don't know who the real Harry Potter is. 

00:01:11.486 --> 00:01:12.570
 They are coming! 

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:14.491
 They are coming! 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.976
 Harry! Stop! Go! 

00:01:22.175 --> 00:01:24.840
 No one but me will die. 

00:01:26.234 --> 00:01:27.608
 You have to do something! 

00:01:29.331 --> 00:01:32.155
 Do you think I don't know what this feels like? - No, you don't know that! 

00:01:32.297 --> 00:01:35.297
 Your parents are dead! You have no family! - Stop! 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:39.602
 THIS AUTUMN 

00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:41.310
 After you, Mr. Potter. 

00:01:41.386 --> 00:01:42.447
 ONLY ONE 

00:01:42.447 --> 00:01:44.250
 Tell me where he is. 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.287
 CAN SURVIVE 

00:01:45.287 --> 00:01:47.335
 You really don't have a chance. 

00:01:53.385 --> 00:01:54.328
 Help me! 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:07.241
 I've seen your heart. And it's mine.
