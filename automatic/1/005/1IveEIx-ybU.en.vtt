00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049

incredible there really is nothing wrong

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.379 
incredible there really is nothing wrong
with<00:04:25.650> van<00:04:25.950> Persie<00:04:26.340> he<00:04:26.700> is<00:04:26.790> a<00:04:26.820> little<00:04:27.000> bit<00:04:27.150> slow

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
with van Persie he is a little bit slow

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.390 
with van Persie he is a little bit slow
to<00:04:27.509> some<00:04:27.659> people's<00:04:27.960> likings<00:04:28.409> he<00:04:28.919> is<00:04:29.009> only<00:04:29.129> 80

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
to some people's likings he is only 80

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.800 
to some people's likings he is only 80
piece<00:04:29.639> but<00:04:29.819> I<00:04:29.849> definitely<00:04:30.150> think<00:04:30.509> that<00:04:30.629> is

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
piece but I definitely think that is

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.020 
piece but I definitely think that is
certainly<00:04:31.110> okay<00:04:31.499> he<00:04:32.069> makes<00:04:32.280> up<00:04:32.460> for<00:04:32.490> it<00:04:32.729> in<00:04:32.789> his

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
certainly okay he makes up for it in his

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.730 
certainly okay he makes up for it in his
dribbling<00:04:33.419> and<00:04:33.629> his<00:04:33.810> shooting<00:04:33.990> his<00:04:34.349> dribbling

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
dribbling and his shooting his dribbling

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.320 
dribbling and his shooting his dribbling
is<00:04:34.919> excellent<00:04:35.400> as<00:04:35.490> well<00:04:35.669> and<00:04:35.819> pairing<00:04:36.120> it<00:04:36.210> up

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
is excellent as well and pairing it up

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.149 
is excellent as well and pairing it up
with<00:04:36.449> his<00:04:36.569> forced<00:04:36.870> our<00:04:36.960> skills<00:04:37.259> just<00:04:37.800> makes<00:04:38.039> it

00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:38.159 
with his forced our skills just makes it

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:39.709 
with his forced our skills just makes it
that<00:04:38.219> much<00:04:38.490> better<00:04:38.550> and<00:04:38.849> as<00:04:38.969> you<00:04:39.090> can<00:04:39.210> see<00:04:39.240> he's

00:04:39.709 --> 00:04:39.719 
that much better and as you can see he's

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:41.209 
that much better and as you can see he's
very<00:04:39.990> versatile<00:04:40.439> he<00:04:40.650> did<00:04:40.860> get<00:04:41.039> a<00:04:41.099> few

00:04:41.209 --> 00:04:41.219 
very versatile he did get a few

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:43.309 
very versatile he did get a few
opportunities<00:04:41.759> on<00:04:42.240> corner<00:04:42.840> kicks<00:04:42.870> to<00:04:43.199> get

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:43.319 
opportunities on corner kicks to get

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:45.140 
opportunities on corner kicks to get
some<00:04:43.499> headers<00:04:43.770> I<00:04:43.949> didn't<00:04:44.430> miss<00:04:44.550> a<00:04:44.580> few<00:04:44.819> but<00:04:45.029> was

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
some headers I didn't miss a few but was

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.059 
some headers I didn't miss a few but was
able<00:04:45.270> to<00:04:45.389> capitalize<00:04:45.930> on<00:04:45.960> that<00:04:46.169> last<00:04:46.560> one<00:04:46.680> so

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:47.069 
able to capitalize on that last one so

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:48.830 
able to capitalize on that last one so
he<00:04:47.189> can<00:04:47.310> also<00:04:47.460> do<00:04:47.639> that<00:04:47.669> his<00:04:47.969> 73<00:04:48.419> heading<00:04:48.659> does

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
he can also do that his 73 heading does

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.779 
he can also do that his 73 heading does
definitely<00:04:49.020> show<00:04:49.409> through<00:04:49.710> and<00:04:49.889> I<00:04:50.249> just<00:04:50.580> think

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
definitely show through and I just think

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:52.939 
definitely show through and I just think
van<00:04:50.909> persie<00:04:51.300> is<00:04:51.330> an<00:04:51.569> absolutely<00:04:52.080> absolutely

or a blue card in your squad that's

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:03.769 
or a blue card in your squad that's
basically<00:05:03.060> what's<00:05:03.330> going<00:05:03.479> to<00:05:03.539> make<00:05:03.629> the

00:05:03.769 --> 00:05:03.779 
basically what's going to make the

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:05.510 
basically what's going to make the

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:08.600 
because I think they're all basically
just<00:05:07.199> as<00:05:07.379> good<00:05:07.529> as<00:05:07.650> each<00:05:07.800> other<00:05:08.009> and<00:05:08.250> that

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
just as good as each other and that

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.309 
just as good as each other and that
they're<00:05:08.789> just<00:05:08.819> a<00:05:09.120> great<00:05:09.150> card<00:05:09.750> overall<00:05:10.110> on<00:05:10.199> an
