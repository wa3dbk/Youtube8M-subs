one<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.490> or<00:01:50.880> I'm<00:01:51.060> going<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.240> find<00:01:51.390> out<00:01:51.570> if

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
one it is or I'm going to find out if

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.539 
one it is or I'm going to find out if
you're<00:01:51.780> all<00:01:51.930> wrong<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.130> started<00:01:53.490> looking

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
you're all wrong so I started looking

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.080 
you're all wrong so I started looking
under<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.000> hood<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.450> going<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:56.090> universities

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
under the hood and going to universities

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.639 
under the hood and going to universities
and<00:01:57.299> talking<00:01:57.600> professors<00:01:58.079> in<00:01:58.200> biochemistry

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
and talking professors in biochemistry

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.950 
and talking professors in biochemistry
physiology<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.729> asking<00:02:00.060> them<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.630> know<00:02:00.750> what

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
physiology and asking them you know what

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.740 
physiology and asking them you know what
happens<00:02:01.350> when

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
happens when

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.200 
happens when
eat<00:02:01.900> this<00:02:02.170> what<00:02:02.980> do<00:02:03.160> enzymes<00:02:03.370> actually<00:02:03.970> do<00:02:04.060> in

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
eat this what do enzymes actually do in

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.390 
eat this what do enzymes actually do in
the<00:02:04.270> body<00:02:04.480> what<00:02:05.470> about<00:02:05.530> temperature<00:02:06.130> and

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
the body what about temperature and

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.190 
the body what about temperature and
denaturing<00:02:06.970> of<00:02:07.120> proteins<00:02:07.510> and<00:02:07.720> enzymes<00:02:07.780> and<00:02:08.140> I

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
denaturing of proteins and enzymes and I

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.630 
denaturing of proteins and enzymes and I
just<00:02:08.380> would<00:02:08.560> ask<00:02:08.679> as<00:02:08.860> many<00:02:08.920> questions<00:02:09.100> as<00:02:09.520> I

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
just would ask as many questions as I

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.350 
just would ask as many questions as I
could<00:02:09.820> i<00:02:10.090> get<00:02:10.630> text<00:02:11.200> books<00:02:11.410> from<00:02:12.360> university

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
could i get text books from university

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.730 
could i get text books from university
bookstores<00:02:13.750> when<00:02:13.900> i<00:02:13.930> go<00:02:14.050> to<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.140> library<00:02:14.560> and

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
bookstores when i go to the library and

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.820 
bookstores when i go to the library and
i<00:02:15.430> just<00:02:15.610> started<00:02:15.730> doing<00:02:16.000> research<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:16.830> the

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
i just started doing research and the

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.040 
i just started doing research and the
more<00:02:18.070> research<00:02:18.370> i<00:02:18.610> did<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:19.300> more<00:02:19.540> I<00:02:19.570> realized

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
more research i did the more I realized

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.470 
more research i did the more I realized
that<00:02:20.170> we<00:02:20.440> know<00:02:20.620> very<00:02:21.280> very<00:02:21.430> little<00:02:21.970> about<00:02:22.270> the

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
that we know very very little about the

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.870 
that we know very very little about the
body<00:02:22.660> and<00:02:22.930> diet<00:02:23.620> and<00:02:23.890> most<00:02:24.340> of<00:02:24.520> the<00:02:24.610> people

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
body and diet and most of the people

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.180 
body and diet and most of the people
that<00:02:24.970> are<00:02:25.030> writing<00:02:25.360> books<00:02:25.600> heard<00:02:26.500> somebody

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
that are writing books heard somebody

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.980 
that are writing books heard somebody
else's<00:02:27.520> theory<00:02:27.940> and<00:02:28.120> then<00:02:28.270> they<00:02:28.360> just<00:02:28.540> parrot

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
else's theory and then they just parrot

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.199 
else's theory and then they just parrot
that<00:02:29.170> information<00:02:29.800> to<00:02:30.459> somebody<00:02:30.850> else<00:02:31.000> to

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
that information to somebody else to

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:32.310 
that information to somebody else to
somebody<00:02:31.540> else<00:02:31.720> and<00:02:31.840> then<00:02:31.959> that<00:02:32.140> person

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
somebody else and then that person

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.840 
somebody else and then that person
writes<00:02:32.650> a<00:02:32.740> book<00:02:32.890> using<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:33.370> information<00:02:33.550> that

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
writes a book using the information that

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.640 
writes a book using the information that
was<00:02:34.000> borrowed<00:02:34.360> and<00:02:34.480> before<00:02:34.720> you<00:02:34.750> know<00:02:34.930> it<00:02:34.959> 20

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
was borrowed and before you know it 20

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.190 
was borrowed and before you know it 20
books<00:02:35.800> have<00:02:36.010> been<00:02:36.040> written<00:02:36.190> and<00:02:37.180> they<00:02:38.140> were

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
books have been written and they were

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.420 
books have been written and they were
based<00:02:38.470> on<00:02:38.680> something<00:02:39.100> that's<00:02:39.190> not<00:02:39.370> even

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
based on something that's not even

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.060 
based on something that's not even
factual<00:02:40.030> but<00:02:40.840> now<00:02:40.959> you<00:02:41.380> know<00:02:41.470> millions<00:02:41.890> of

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
factual but now you know millions of

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.350 
factual but now you know millions of
people<00:02:42.340> believe<00:02:42.580> that<00:02:42.760> this<00:02:42.880> thing<00:02:43.090> is<00:02:43.120> true

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
people believe that this thing is true

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.510 
people believe that this thing is true
and<00:02:43.600> there's<00:02:43.810> 20<00:02:44.110> books<00:02:44.290> to<00:02:44.980> prove<00:02:45.160> it<00:02:45.370> and

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
and there's 20 books to prove it and

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.160 
and there's 20 books to prove it and
they've<00:02:45.670> got<00:02:45.820> references<00:02:46.060> but<00:02:46.570> the<00:02:46.840> original

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
they've got references but the original

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.740 
they've got references but the original
study<00:02:47.860> was<00:02:48.430> flawed<00:02:48.730> it<00:02:49.030> was<00:02:49.120> just<00:02:49.300> a<00:02:49.390> theory

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
study was flawed it was just a theory

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.780 
study was flawed it was just a theory
yeah<00:02:50.260> you<00:02:50.560> mentioned<00:02:50.739> people<00:02:51.280> out<00:02:51.370> of<00:02:51.489> fear
