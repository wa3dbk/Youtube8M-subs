 we went to analyze let's say the two X's 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.480
 and thanks to that they are filtered until 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.480
 now 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.110

 the Croatian is pronounced I'm not sorry 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.620
 neither germán the interest is that he reads it 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.740
 him because I do not know very well pronounces neither 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.780
 portugal nor italian only ni nor german 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.060
 he has it 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.730
 he told me that we will give him my mother 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.160
 how are we good Japanese or 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.020
 damn idea in Japanese either 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.750
 He does not say a damned idea of what 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.480
 he says that neither since either so 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.700
 come back then I read it the same as what 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.340
 read the same good will be of attribute 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.600
 earth is going to have warrior types going to 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.480
 be a monster of the effect that follows 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.300
 accepts vice is going to form with monsters 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.500
 level one is going to have sensation attack 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:55.400
 they have something that is quite minimal and the 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:59.370
 thing the effect of the letter is continuous 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.709
 thriller fast and do not quite know what 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.290
 it's good we're going to pass the important thing that 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:07.140
 it would be the effect they are going to be three monsters 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.360
 Level 1 to see what this letter 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.880
 face up in attack position not 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.100
 can be destroyed in battle when you 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.739
 you receive battle damage from a 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.569
 battle involving this letter will 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:22.260
 inflicts is the damage 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:25.739
 the damage to your opponent 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:30.390
 and you will receive only take your opponent 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.390
 when is this way we say this letter 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.730
 fight with a monster of your opponent 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:39.200
 during the 1 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.200
 the calculation of the damage 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.410
 of the players of the turn of the 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.870
 players you can buy a material 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.930
 that is accepted from this letter and had rival 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.659
 carries 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.239
 the battle damage that you were going to receive 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:55.739
 a pretty weak letter given that 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.189
 defense but with a pretty effect 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.189
 good 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.790
 well it seems that the 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.709
 episodes of sexual anime 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.870
 and let's move on to the next letter that 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:14.790
 has filtered which is going to be called 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.790
 wait a moment to put the image 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:24.200
 We are number 63 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:29.630
 we are we and soldier 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:31.420
 soldiers would be Spanish number 73 to 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.850
 monks and zolder 1 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.410
 connected in germany-italy not in 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.850
 Japanese and that's what in the other letter 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.430
 that is not very well pronounce them and that 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.550
 the law you 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:44.510
 sleeve 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:47.180
 this attribute light the guys are going to do 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:49.760
 up and a glass a monster that yes that 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.560
 accept defect is the way this is 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.320
 of a star and it's going to have zero 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.900
 attack and 2003 defense quite defense 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:00.139
 the truth that this monster is going to have 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.840
 and well the effect 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:05.710
 show level 1 is not known very well 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.710
 those that are going to be 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:13.790
 so you can say you can only 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:15.650
 use the effect of number 63 to mochis 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:18.110
 only has one turn per turn had 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.730
 uncoupling an xy monster is a matter 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.620
 which is accepted from this letter then 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:24.080
 activate one of these effects to 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:27.629
 pipe argument 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.889
 to your opponent's trade of the 

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:31.639
 next is so difficult from your opponent 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:34.569
 both players draw a card 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:37.740
 both players win x lite points 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:39.750
 good letter pretty 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.500
 I would not say cheat as it affects both 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:45.000
 players but you do not have enough of 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.770
 2000 either with truly neither 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.539
 it is so much I do not know that he has 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.970
 balanced for what seems to be 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:52.590
 writing quite a bit since it affects the 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.110
 effect to the two players as they see 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.930
 I said before and one thing that I know 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:02.190
 I forgot to tell you and it's a thing about 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:05.910
 have to put the image for here the 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:09.330
 about going out in 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:12.540
 good in English the hull on July 12 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:14.650
 of 2013 and in German on July 11 , 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.990
 2013 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.120
 now you ask me this information 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:26.300
 I have signed 100 I would say it is 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:28.699
 60% more would be 185% confirmed I think 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:31.759
 with at least I think it's all 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:32.990
 all reliable except the output oil 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:35.030
 I'm not sure if it's reliable 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:38.780
 but I already tell you that envelopes and letters 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:41.509
 I say that they are 80 to 90% are reliable 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.740
 or be safe and good nothing I hope that you 

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:44.900
 have liked this new section that I'm going 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.849

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.470
