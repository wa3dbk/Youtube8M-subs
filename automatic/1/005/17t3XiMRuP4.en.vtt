00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.210
 and make you plug it's a 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.740
 equiterre educational campaign that aims 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.790
 to better understand what are the 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.290
 electric transport 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.849
 we are associated with several 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.990
 associations of owners of 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:20.759
 electric vehicles of companies 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.489
 public transit we walk to 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:24.810
 through Quebec to better demystify 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:27.649
 all this question lot of 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.649
 transport electrification 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.510
 experts are interested in 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.700
 the electrification of transport what 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.200
 Quebec more than 40% of gas emissions 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.680
 greenhouse gas well sector 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.660
 transport network 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.430
 how are we tackling sum of 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.320
 different ways better thinking new 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.150
 better arrange them more transport 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.530
 collective but we will still have 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.870
 need to use cars during 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.160
 a long time and more we will use 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.840
 electric cars the more we will succeed 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.160
 to reduce our ecological footprint 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.830
 reduce our greenhouse gas emissions 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.210
 greenhouse trick to other categories of 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.010
 spin-offs for gill appointments 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.810
 the first is to see how much 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.300
 there is an effervescence park in quebec 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.009
 a municipal world in the regions of 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.080
 gatineau to rimouski going through 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.820
 Montreal and Quebec as we team up 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.259
 at municipal councils organizations 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.520
 tourism companies 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:15.960
 car dealers who 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.060
 is interested in the whole question 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.500
 electrification on the one hand and the other 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.820
 share for people who would like 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.440
 become vehicle owners 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.240
 electric to meet others 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.800
 owners who thought in some 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.780
 like eric for years of being able 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.170
 exchange with one thing really 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.170
 precious 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.210
 and reborn gills to fight it's 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.579
 a way to put around a table 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.530
 for a computer who are interested in 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:40.729
 the question of electrification then 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.469
 of car dealers 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.210
 government departments of quebec and 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:45.890
 municipalities of the owners of 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.600
 electric vehicles to see how 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.759
 complains nor Quebec even further to 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.310
 take this turn there to a situation 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.409
 turned his back more and more to 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.149
 oil and make Quebec a place 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.710
 for both 1.1 million 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.610
 ecological performance that no 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.159
 performing 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.159
 you 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.159
 we
