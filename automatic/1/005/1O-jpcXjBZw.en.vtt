00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.350 
over here and if your enemy ocular meet
a<00:01:25.560> few<00:01:25.740> teammates<00:01:26.100> occupy<00:01:26.580> this<00:01:26.640> area<00:01:27.150> and

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
a few teammates occupy this area and

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.749 
a few teammates occupy this area and
they<00:01:28.200> occupy<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.680> area<00:01:29.340> then<00:01:29.490> they're<00:01:29.610> going

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
they occupy that area then they're going

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.550 
they occupy that area then they're going
to<00:01:29.820> spawn<00:01:30.030> all<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.570> way<00:01:30.689> in<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:30.900> building<00:01:31.320> so

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
to spawn all the way in that building so

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.950 
to spawn all the way in that building so
that's<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.100> that's<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.430> third<00:01:33.210> spawn<00:01:33.780> but

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
that's the that's the third spawn but

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.990 
that's the that's the third spawn but
primaries<00:01:34.500> are<00:01:34.619> here<00:01:34.860> in<00:01:34.979> here<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.790> find

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
primaries are here in here so you find

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.609 
primaries are here in here so you find
out<00:01:36.119> whatever<00:01:36.299> what<00:01:36.960> look<00:01:37.200> on<00:01:37.290> your<00:01:37.409> mini-map

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
you cannot cap the drop zone kind of

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.109 
you cannot cap the drop zone kind of
keep<00:01:55.350> them<00:01:55.500> off<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.009> stuff<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.490> then

at the last second go over and grab it

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.980 
at the last second go over and grab it
like<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.280> just<00:01:59.340> did<00:01:59.579> and<00:02:00.030> maybe<00:02:00.570> you'll<00:02:00.780> get<00:02:00.930> a

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
like I just did and maybe you'll get a

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.260 
like I just did and maybe you'll get a
good<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.890> care<00:02:02.130> package<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.850> works<00:02:03.000> pretty<00:02:03.149> good

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
good a care package it works pretty good

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.649 
good a care package it works pretty good
for<00:02:03.420> me<00:02:03.750> but<00:02:04.530> um<00:02:04.740> this<00:02:05.729> drop<00:02:06.030> zone<00:02:06.270> this<00:02:06.540> is

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
for me but um this drop zone this is

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.330 
for me but um this drop zone this is
another<00:02:06.869> one<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.110> those<00:02:07.229> death<00:02:07.500> traps<00:02:07.530> this<00:02:08.160> is

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
another one of those death traps this is

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.550 
another one of those death traps this is
a<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:09.270> hear<00:02:09.539> you're<00:02:09.810> going<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.050> die<00:02:10.200> so<00:02:10.500> if

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
a you hear you're going to die so if

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.660 
a you hear you're going to die so if
you're<00:02:10.679> on<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.800> mobile<00:02:11.009> streak<00:02:11.310> or<00:02:11.430> anything

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
you're on a mobile streak or anything

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.300 
you're on a mobile streak or anything
like<00:02:11.700> that

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
like that

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.400 
like that
don't<00:02:14.310> go<00:02:14.430> too<00:02:14.490> close<00:02:14.820> to<00:02:15.090> this<00:02:15.210> one<00:02:15.390> um<00:02:15.600> but

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
don't go too close to this one um but

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.960 
don't go too close to this one um but
that<00:02:16.800> being<00:02:16.830> said<00:02:17.070> you're<00:02:17.610> gonna<00:02:17.670> want<00:02:17.940> to

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
that being said you're gonna want to

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.940 
that being said you're gonna want to
make<00:02:18.120> sure<00:02:18.150> this<00:02:18.420> this<00:02:18.930> truck<00:02:19.170> is<00:02:19.200> exploded

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
make sure this this truck is exploded

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.970 
make sure this this truck is exploded
before<00:02:20.100> you<00:02:20.340> go<00:02:20.460> to<00:02:20.520> it<00:02:20.780> because<00:02:21.780> needs<00:02:22.320> stuns

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
before you go to it because needs stuns

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.710 
before you go to it because needs stuns
everything<00:02:23.580> can<00:02:23.760> just<00:02:23.940> funnel<00:02:24.300> right<00:02:24.480> into

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
everything can just funnel right into

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.120 
everything can just funnel right into
this<00:02:24.810> I<00:02:25.020> mean<00:02:25.110> it's<00:02:25.260> like<00:02:25.380> a<00:02:25.410> little<00:02:25.590> catcher's

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
this I mean it's like a little catcher's

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.220 
this I mean it's like a little catcher's
mitt<00:02:26.340> her<00:02:26.880> needs<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:27.360> stuns<00:02:27.660> and<00:02:27.870> everything

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
mitt her needs and stuns and everything

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.350 
mitt her needs and stuns and everything
is<00:02:28.320> crazy<00:02:28.590> but<00:02:29.310> a<00:02:29.370> little<00:02:29.760> line<00:02:29.880> of<00:02:30.030> sight<00:02:30.210> of

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
is crazy but a little line of sight of

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.760 
is crazy but a little line of sight of
course<00:02:30.510> you<00:02:30.750> can<00:02:30.840> poke<00:02:30.990> your<00:02:31.110> head<00:02:31.170> over<00:02:31.410> here

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
course you can poke your head over here

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.380 
course you can poke your head over here
you<00:02:32.400> know<00:02:32.490> kill<00:02:32.730> them<00:02:32.910> they're<00:02:33.090> they're<00:02:33.270> going

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
you know kill them they're they're going

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.830 
you know kill them they're they're going
to<00:02:33.450> spawn<00:02:33.690> in<00:02:33.960> here<00:02:34.350> and<00:02:35.690> they're<00:02:36.690> going<00:02:36.780> to

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
to spawn in here and they're going to

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.390 
to spawn in here and they're going to
catch<00:02:37.050> you<00:02:37.170> off<00:02:37.200> guard<00:02:37.320> by<00:02:37.800> spawning<00:02:38.040> in<00:02:38.280> here

catch you off guard by spawning in here

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.480 
catch you off guard by spawning in here
it's<00:02:38.670> kind<00:02:38.820> of<00:02:38.940> crazy<00:02:39.180> but<00:02:40.070> they<00:02:41.070> will<00:02:41.220> spawn

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
it's kind of crazy but they will spawn

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:42.770 
it's kind of crazy but they will spawn
right<00:02:41.760> in<00:02:41.940> here<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.240> they'll<00:02:42.330> spot<00:02:42.570> right<00:02:42.750> on

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
right in here and they'll spot right on

this drop zone it's nuts but see I

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.290 
this drop zone it's nuts but see I
wasn't<00:02:46.860> on<00:02:47.070> it<00:02:47.220> I<00:02:47.280> get<00:02:47.460> on<00:02:47.580> it<00:02:47.670> for<00:02:47.790> two<00:02:47.910> seconds

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
wasn't on it I get on it for two seconds
