peaks naturally what it look like when

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.760 
peaks naturally what it look like when
they're<00:02:49.220> there<00:02:51.010> all<00:02:52.010> right<00:02:52.160> these<00:02:52.490> look<00:02:52.670> good

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.930 
they're there all right these look good
flip<00:02:54.770> them<00:02:54.890> over<00:02:54.980> your<00:02:55.100> head<00:02:55.160> if<00:02:55.610> they<00:02:55.760> don't

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
flip them over your head if they don't

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.980

fall<00:02:56.150> they're<00:02:56.570> stiff<00:02:56.750> peaks<00:02:57.370> okay<00:02:58.370> so<00:02:58.840> in<00:02:59.840> the

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
fall they're stiff peaks okay so in the

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.630 
fall they're stiff peaks okay so in the
bowl<00:03:00.110> that<00:03:00.320> I've<00:03:00.410> dusted<00:03:00.710> my<00:03:01.010> lemon<00:03:01.340> in<00:03:01.460> I'm

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
bowl that I've dusted my lemon in I'm

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.760 
bowl that I've dusted my lemon in I'm
gonna<00:03:01.790> add<00:03:01.940> in<00:03:02.150> my<00:03:02.180> recalls<00:03:02.630> done<00:03:02.840> and<00:03:03.560> I<00:03:03.710> think

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
gonna add in my recalls done and I think

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.200 
gonna add in my recalls done and I think
the<00:03:04.040> whole<00:03:04.220> milk<00:03:04.430> we<00:03:04.520> caught<00:03:04.670> that<00:03:04.850> does<00:03:05.030> make

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
the whole milk we caught that does make

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.730 
the whole milk we caught that does make
a<00:03:05.270> difference<00:03:05.330> but<00:03:05.870> you<00:03:05.960> can<00:03:06.110> try<00:03:06.290> using<00:03:06.530> a

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
a difference but you can try using a

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.880 
a difference but you can try using a
parts<00:03:07.040> cam<00:03:07.310> I<00:03:07.520> never<00:03:07.850> have<00:03:08.090> so<00:03:08.810> I<00:03:09.170> really

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
parts cam I never have so I really

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.500 
parts cam I never have so I really
wouldn't<00:03:10.130> be<00:03:10.400> able<00:03:10.460> to<00:03:10.580> say<00:03:10.850> whether<00:03:11.090> it<00:03:11.330> works

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
wouldn't be able to say whether it works

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.480 
wouldn't be able to say whether it works
as<00:03:11.690> well<00:03:11.870> but<00:03:12.200> can<00:03:12.710> you<00:03:12.770> imagine<00:03:12.830> it<00:03:13.160> wouldn't

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
as well but can you imagine it wouldn't

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:19.120 
as well but can you imagine it wouldn't
so<00:03:14.420> we<00:03:15.020> got<00:03:15.200> them<00:03:15.640> egg<00:03:16.640> yolks<00:03:17.800> touch<00:03:18.800> of

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
so we got them egg yolks touch of

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.260 
so we got them egg yolks touch of
vanilla<00:03:19.580> just<00:03:20.180> a<00:03:20.270> little<00:03:20.510> bit<00:03:20.630> not<00:03:21.320> too<00:03:21.380> much

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
vanilla just a little bit not too much

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.370 
vanilla just a little bit not too much
there<00:03:23.270> you<00:03:23.330> go<00:03:23.570> the<00:03:23.810> reason<00:03:24.020> when<00:03:24.140> I'm<00:03:24.230> not

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
there you go the reason when I'm not

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.110 
there you go the reason when I'm not
using<00:03:24.590> my<00:03:24.830> bunny<00:03:25.070> lean<00:03:25.310> on<00:03:25.459> my<00:03:25.580> little<00:03:25.910> bags

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
using my bunny lean on my little bags

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.970 
using my bunny lean on my little bags
because<00:03:26.630> I<00:03:26.660> don't<00:03:26.900> like<00:03:27.110> to<00:03:27.320> leave<00:03:27.410> them<00:03:27.590> open

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
because I don't like to leave them open

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.680 
because I don't like to leave them open
and<00:03:28.160> I<00:03:28.400> wouldn't<00:03:28.730> need<00:03:28.850> a<00:03:28.910> whole<00:03:29.090> bag<00:03:29.300> for<00:03:29.570> this

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
and I wouldn't need a whole bag for this

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.960 
and I wouldn't need a whole bag for this
so<00:03:29.950> touch<00:03:30.950> a<00:03:30.980> sugar<00:03:31.310> just<00:03:31.730> a<00:03:31.790> couple

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
so touch a sugar just a couple

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.480 
so touch a sugar just a couple
tablespoons<00:03:32.530> and<00:03:33.530> I'm<00:03:33.620> just<00:03:33.800> gonna<00:03:33.920> use<00:03:34.010> the

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490 
tablespoons and I'm just gonna use the

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:41.210 
tablespoons and I'm just gonna use the
same<00:03:34.610> mixer<00:03:35.360> here<00:03:35.630> to<00:03:36.260> whisk<00:03:36.560> this<00:03:36.740> all<00:03:36.890> up

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.580 

adding<00:03:42.220> in<00:03:42.340> our<00:03:42.460> dry<00:03:42.910> ingredients<00:03:43.380> mix<00:03:44.380> those

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
adding in our dry ingredients mix those

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.200 
adding in our dry ingredients mix those
in<00:03:45.750> batter<00:03:46.750> but<00:03:47.140> don't<00:03:47.500> worry<00:03:47.850> it<00:03:48.850> ends<00:03:49.090> up

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:49.210 
in batter but don't worry it ends up

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.070 
in batter but don't worry it ends up
working<00:03:49.420> in<00:03:49.660> the<00:03:49.720> end

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
working in the end

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.330 
working in the end
I'm<00:03:52.080> gonna<00:03:52.230> add<00:03:52.410> a<00:03:52.440> touch<00:03:52.740> of<00:03:52.770> luck<00:03:53.100> that<00:03:53.280> I

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
I'm gonna add a touch of luck that I

00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:07.140 
I'm gonna add a touch of luck that I
didn't<00:03:53.670> have<00:03:53.790> out<00:03:54.030> but<00:03:56.030> I<00:03:57.030> knew<00:03:57.780> delays

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150
