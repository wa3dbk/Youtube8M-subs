00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.610
 we keep walking well 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:05.320
 although the children or nothing happens the 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:09.930
 dog is controlled is socialized 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.930
 and there we will take it without pay 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.580
 but not 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.800
 [Music] 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.980
 the dog must be in four soon 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.220
 which is sphinx type can not be the 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.380
 hip 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:27.260
 recharged on the floor so we can 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:31.479
 follow in a normal walk and do not 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.479
 It is hard work to get up to the dog 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.430
 we keep walking 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.020
 left turn 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:47.720
 the dog does not hinder high sitting 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.440
 We will leave it automatic to 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.440
 point to run 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.640
 we 're going to throw it to the belt 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.180
 if they are fixed, the dog remains the same 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:08.950
 four points types well je 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.950
 we are not going to accept that 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.450
 [Music] 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.380

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.070

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.070
 okay 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.020
 and sit back like that 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:31.160
 with an order or automatic look everything 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:34.520
 depends on the handler or the dog 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.520
 we keep walking 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:46.369
 [Music] 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:52.350

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.770
 the dog congratulates 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:59.520
 is calm the dog is not going to 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:02.780
 give no prize to eat all your 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.780
 prize is going to be a caress 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.850

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.790
 we keep walking 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:17.750
 right turn very well 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.750
 I'll leave it quiet 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.450
 the dog was not given any order 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:28.599
 deserted to neither of cast only was 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.599
 still there we will accept it like that 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.600
 we are going to take it 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.209
 now 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:41.400
 we leave it so we're going to give a 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:45.659
 return 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:48.829
 but you do not have to move, let's move on 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:48.829
 on top of him 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:59.270

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.270

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.960
