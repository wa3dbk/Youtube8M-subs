speaking<00:00:12.050> on<00:00:12.170> the<00:00:12.200> soul<00:00:12.560> these<00:00:12.950> are<00:00:13.070> all<00:00:13.190> nnn

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:13.820 
speaking on the soul these are all nnn

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.640 
speaking on the soul these are all nnn
there's<00:00:14.510> two<00:00:14.810> grooves<00:00:15.080> running<00:00:15.410> down<00:00:15.530> the

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 
there's two grooves running down the

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.370 
there's two grooves running down the
center<00:00:15.830> so<00:00:16.190> make<00:00:16.940> sure<00:00:17.120> that<00:00:17.510> you<00:00:17.810> have<00:00:17.960> an<00:00:18.050> NN

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
center so make sure that you have an NN

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.710 
center so make sure that you have an NN
binding<00:00:18.890> and<00:00:19.160> when<00:00:19.970> we<00:00:20.060> say<00:00:20.180> on<00:00:20.300> an<00:00:20.390> end<00:00:20.540> we

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
binding and when we say on an end we

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.810 
binding and when we say on an end we
mean<00:00:20.900> at<00:00:21.500> this<00:00:21.650> point<00:00:21.890> the<00:00:22.070> touring<00:00:22.520> versus

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
mean at this point the touring versus

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.730 
mean at this point the touring versus
the<00:00:22.910> backcountry<00:00:23.240> so<00:00:23.540> NNN<00:00:23.990> touring<00:00:24.410> is<00:00:24.560> the

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
the backcountry so NNN touring is the

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.500 
the backcountry so NNN touring is the
binding<00:00:25.010> that<00:00:25.070> you<00:00:25.220> need<00:00:25.400> to<00:00:25.820> work<00:00:25.939> with<00:00:26.000> this

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
binding that you need to work with this

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.300 
binding that you need to work with this
type<00:00:26.779> of<00:00:26.960> boot<00:00:27.110> and<00:00:27.410> these<00:00:27.590> are<00:00:27.710> all<00:00:27.830> NN<00:00:28.160> and

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
type of boot and these are all NN and

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.310 
type of boot and these are all NN and
touring<00:00:28.580> boots<00:00:28.789> and<00:00:29.360> here's<00:00:29.570> two<00:00:29.810> options<00:00:30.200> for

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
touring boots and here's two options for

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.020 
touring boots and here's two options for
bindings<00:00:30.800> here's<00:00:31.789> the<00:00:31.910> t3<00:00:32.390> auto<00:00:32.830> automatic

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
bindings here's the t3 auto automatic

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.510 
bindings here's the t3 auto automatic
meaning<00:00:35.030> you<00:00:35.720> line<00:00:36.080> up<00:00:36.110> the<00:00:36.350> tow<00:00:36.500> bar<00:00:36.710> right<00:00:37.430> in

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
meaning you line up the tow bar right in

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.320 
meaning you line up the tow bar right in
front<00:00:37.640> of<00:00:37.699> that<00:00:37.760> bumper<00:00:38.210> and<00:00:38.809> you<00:00:39.350> step<00:00:39.770> down

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.330 
front of that bumper and you step down

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.430 
front of that bumper and you step down
it's<00:00:41.330> not<00:00:41.480> so<00:00:41.690> easy<00:00:41.870> when<00:00:42.020> you're<00:00:42.140> pushing<00:00:42.350> on

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
it's not so easy when you're pushing on

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.350 
it's not so easy when you're pushing on
a<00:00:42.530> table<00:00:42.860> there<00:00:42.980> you<00:00:43.070> go<00:00:43.129> and<00:00:43.460> you<00:00:43.790> are<00:00:43.940> engaged

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
a table there you go and you are engaged

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.540 
a table there you go and you are engaged
and<00:00:44.780> then<00:00:45.350> you're<00:00:45.920> kicking<00:00:46.160> and<00:00:46.280> gliding

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
and then you're kicking and gliding

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.729 
and then you're kicking and gliding
along<00:00:46.670> and<00:00:47.149> to<00:00:47.239> release<00:00:47.510> you<00:00:47.690> push<00:00:47.960> your<00:00:48.230> ski

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
along and to release you push your ski

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:50.350 
along and to release you push your ski
pole<00:00:48.920> on<00:00:49.040> that<00:00:49.160> little<00:00:49.280> button<00:00:49.970> and<00:00:50.090> out<00:00:50.210> you

pole on that little button and out you
go

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
go

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.250 
go
that's<00:00:51.649> the<00:00:51.860> Chi<00:00:52.040> 3<00:00:52.340> Auto<00:00:52.550> and<00:00:52.960> then<00:00:53.960> we've<00:00:54.140> got

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
that's the Chi 3 Auto and then we've got

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.920 
that's the Chi 3 Auto and then we've got
the<00:00:54.440> t4<00:00:54.980> which<00:00:55.730> just<00:00:55.940> works<00:00:56.300> the<00:00:56.420> same<00:00:56.719> way

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
the t4 which just works the same way

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.680 
the t4 which just works the same way
it's<00:00:57.110> an<00:00:57.200> automatic<00:00:57.500> binding<00:00:58.100> but<00:00:58.760> it<00:00:59.270> is

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
it's an automatic binding but it is

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.290 
it's an automatic binding but it is
designed<00:00:59.989> to<00:01:00.410> work<00:01:00.440> with<00:01:00.829> the<00:01:01.030> what<00:01:02.030> is<00:01:02.120> called

the ski this is meant to work with this
n<00:01:17.270> is<00:01:17.360> plate<00:01:17.840> where<00:01:18.229> the<00:01:18.290> binding<00:01:18.729> actually

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
n is plate where the binding actually

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.000 
n is plate where the binding actually
slides<00:01:20.680> onto<00:01:21.680> a<00:01:21.710> track<00:01:22.280> and<00:01:23.500> locks<00:01:24.500> into<00:01:24.799> place

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
slides onto a track and locks into place

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.670 
slides onto a track and locks into place
and<00:01:25.520> the<00:01:26.390> nice<00:01:26.540> the<00:01:26.869> benefit<00:01:27.200> of<00:01:27.229> this<00:01:27.350> is<00:01:27.530> one

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
and the nice the benefit of this is one

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.620 
and the nice the benefit of this is one
you're<00:01:27.799> not<00:01:27.890> putting<00:01:28.040> holes<00:01:28.280> in<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:28.549> ski<00:01:28.790> you

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
you're not putting holes in the ski you

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.830 
you're not putting holes in the ski you
get<00:01:29.840> really<00:01:30.260> good<00:01:30.820> contact<00:01:31.820> to<00:01:32.150> the<00:01:32.570> ski

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
get really good contact to the ski

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.710 
get really good contact to the ski
you're<00:01:33.350> connected<00:01:34.010> on<00:01:34.130> the<00:01:34.159> edges<00:01:34.610> so<00:01:35.180> it

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
you're connected on the edges so it

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.670 
you're connected on the edges so it
actually<00:01:35.960> does<00:01:36.110> give<00:01:36.290> you<00:01:36.350> little<00:01:36.439> more<00:01:36.560> edge

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
actually does give you little more edge

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.789 
actually does give you little more edge
pressure<00:01:36.920> and<00:01:37.220> you<00:01:37.520> can<00:01:37.580> actually<00:01:37.820> move<00:01:38.119> the

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
pressure and you can actually move the

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.320 
pressure and you can actually move the
balance<00:01:39.799> point<00:01:40.070> forward<00:01:40.520> and<00:01:40.670> backward<00:01:41.119> if

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
balance point forward and backward if

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.200 
balance point forward and backward if
that<00:01:41.990> is<00:01:42.140> your<00:01:42.259> thing<00:01:42.850> we<00:01:43.850> don't<00:01:44.000> get<00:01:44.090> too

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
that is your thing we don't get too

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.490 
that is your thing we don't get too
complicated<00:01:44.540> there<00:01:44.840> but<00:01:44.960> the<00:01:45.020> idea<00:01:45.290> is<00:01:45.409> you

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
complicated there but the idea is you

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.600 
complicated there but the idea is you
can<00:01:45.650> actually<00:01:45.740> move<00:01:46.009> it<00:01:46.159> forward<00:01:46.460> and<00:01:46.549> back

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
can actually move it forward and back

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:47.980 
can actually move it forward and back
depending<00:01:47.150> on<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:47.299> snow<00:01:47.479> conditions<00:01:47.659> which

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
depending on the snow conditions which

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.810 
depending on the snow conditions which
actually<00:01:48.290> can<00:01:48.560> help<00:01:48.770> your<00:01:48.979> performance<00:01:49.250> and

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
actually can help your performance and

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.580 
actually can help your performance and
if<00:01:50.420> you're<00:01:50.540> training<00:01:50.869> ski<00:01:51.110> some<00:01:51.320> little<00:01:51.500> bit

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
if you're training ski some little bit

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.870 
if you're training ski some little bit
heavier<00:01:51.890> than<00:01:52.040> you<00:01:52.159> are<00:01:52.310> you<00:01:52.640> can<00:01:52.759> actually

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
heavier than you are you can actually

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.730 
heavier than you are you can actually
with<00:01:53.390> those<00:01:53.509> two<00:01:53.720> will<00:01:53.869> slide<00:01:54.439> the<00:01:54.560> buying

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
with those two will slide the buying

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.980 
with those two will slide the buying
back<00:01:54.950> or<00:01:55.189> forward<00:01:55.460> ahead<00:01:56.180> or<00:01:56.390> behind<00:01:56.540> the

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
back or forward ahead or behind the
