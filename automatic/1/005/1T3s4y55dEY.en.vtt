00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
running all over here or something again

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.960 
running all over here or something again
and<00:02:06.110> actually<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.500> SME<00:02:08.190> I'm<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.580> base<00:02:08.729> thing

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
and actually the SME I'm the base thing

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.130 
and actually the SME I'm the base thing
so<00:02:09.060> I'm<00:02:09.119> supposed<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.330> run<00:02:09.479> back<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.810> rock<00:02:09.989> or

not over there but you get the point so

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.020 
not over there but you get the point so

the this north side away from everyone

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.760 
the this north side away from everyone
so<00:03:34.830> pretty<00:03:35.130> much<00:03:35.220> what<00:03:35.430> happens<00:03:35.550> that<00:03:35.970> um<00:03:36.770> he

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
so pretty much what happens that um he

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.150 
so pretty much what happens that um he
will<00:03:38.780> when<00:03:39.780> the<00:03:39.900> green<00:03:40.050> bug<00:03:40.200> has<00:03:40.380> launched<00:03:40.860> um
