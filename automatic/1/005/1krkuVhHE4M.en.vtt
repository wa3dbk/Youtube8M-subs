of the brain sandwich we don't know what
that<00:01:56.200> is<00:01:56.500> we<00:01:56.740> just<00:01:56.860> ordered<00:01:57.220> one<00:01:57.340> brain

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
that is we just ordered one brain

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.520 
that is we just ordered one brain
sandwich<00:01:58.030> so<00:02:00.030> don't<00:02:01.030> count<00:02:01.180> on<00:02:01.330> it<00:02:01.390> it's<00:02:02.200> it's
