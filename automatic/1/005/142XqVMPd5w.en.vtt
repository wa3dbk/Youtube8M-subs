question by placing who or what before
it<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:16.290> answer<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.100> will<00:01:17.250> get<00:01:17.520> would<00:01:18.210> be<00:01:18.240> the

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
it the answer you will get would be the

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.789 
it the answer you will get would be the
subject<00:01:19.250> for<00:01:20.250> example<00:01:21.259> children<00:01:22.259> have

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
subject for example children have

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.149 
subject for example children have
littered<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.460> playground<00:01:24.360> with<00:01:24.630> popcorn<00:01:25.159> now

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
littered the playground with popcorn now

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.929 
littered the playground with popcorn now
here<00:01:26.610> children<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.380> subject<00:01:28.950> have

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
here children is the subject have

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.749 
here children is the subject have
littered<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.780> playground<00:01:31.350> with<00:01:31.590> popcorn<00:01:31.920> is

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
littered the playground with popcorn is

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.210 
littered the playground with popcorn is
a<00:01:32.820> predicate<00:01:35.119> the<00:01:36.119> verb<00:01:36.509> in<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.200> sentence<00:01:37.799> is

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
a predicate the verb in the sentence is

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.649 
a predicate the verb in the sentence is
littered<00:01:39.290> when<00:01:40.290> we<00:01:40.439> ask<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:41.100> question<00:01:41.270> who<00:01:42.270> or

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
littered when we ask the question who or

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.730 
littered when we ask the question who or
what<00:01:43.470> littered<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.670> answer<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.600> children<00:01:46.409> did

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
what littered the answer is children did

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.210 
what littered the answer is children did
so<00:01:47.689> children<00:01:48.689> is<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.320> subject<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.100> the

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
so children is the subject of the

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.359 
so children is the subject of the
sentence<00:01:50.750> whereas<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:52.590> rest<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.189> the

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
sentence whereas the rest of the

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.899 
sentence whereas the rest of the
sentence<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.390> predicate<00:01:55.100> which<00:01:56.100> goes<00:01:56.490> to

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
sentence is the predicate which goes to

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.330 
sentence is the predicate which goes to
relate<00:01:57.420> something<00:01:58.350> about<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.280> subject<00:02:01.340> yes

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
relate something about the subject yes

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.050 
relate something about the subject yes
my<00:02:02.670> we<00:02:03.600> have<00:02:03.899> understood<00:02:04.799> how<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.460> identify

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
my we have understood how to identify

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.529 
my we have understood how to identify
the<00:02:06.780> subject<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:08.280> predicate<00:02:08.360> in<00:02:09.360> a

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
the subject and the predicate in a
