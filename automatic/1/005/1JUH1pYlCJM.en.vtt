cover-up<00:03:05.519> be<00:03:05.760> honest<00:03:06.120> by<00:03:06.360> Jason<00:03:06.810> Mraz<00:03:06.959> as<00:03:07.500> you

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
cover-up be honest by Jason Mraz as you

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.360 
cover-up be honest by Jason Mraz as you
can<00:03:08.400> tell<00:03:08.700> from<00:03:09.180> my<00:03:09.269> background<00:03:09.959> I<00:03:10.349> had<00:03:11.220> to

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
can tell from my background I had to

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.600 
can tell from my background I had to
turn<00:03:11.519> on<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:11.819> lights<00:03:12.230> because<00:03:13.230> it<00:03:14.099> got<00:03:14.310> so

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
turn on the lights because it got so

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.110 
turn on the lights because it got so
dark<00:03:14.640> and<00:03:15.239> it's<00:03:15.989> 4:30<00:03:16.769> so<00:03:17.640> I<00:03:17.670> guess<00:03:17.909> this<00:03:18.060> is

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
dark and it's 4:30 so I guess this is

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.920 
dark and it's 4:30 so I guess this is
what<00:03:18.390> happens<00:03:18.900> when<00:03:19.110> winter<00:03:19.530> is<00:03:19.620> here<00:03:20.930> let's

take a brief moment to grieve that falls

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.390 
take a brief moment to grieve that falls
over<00:03:24.720> and<00:03:24.989> winters<00:03:25.709> here<00:03:27.829> okay<00:03:28.860> moments<00:03:29.340> over
