00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.950
 cleaned up and play the regular season but on 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:19.730
 6 divisions ended new stage 75 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:19.730
 postgame comments and baking there 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:34.419
 Print 31 led correctly collects 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.419
 very much in the texts of the three fields was 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.920
 strategies that hit and 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.309
 accordingly it is inattentive roads 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.309
 and played 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:52.070
 lucky year has changed more 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.530
 uniqueness got on the same rake that 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.199
 him victory 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.649
 we use our moments and always 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:04.940
 ready for defense take key done 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:07.009
 so let's say for the first time the result has gathered 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:23.619
 I am pleased to say that no one 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:44.050
 character flag then injury 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:44.050
 hand fracture discrimination 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.900
 so you too will learn everything now take off 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:58.900
 will cause you say this game moment or 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:02:02.070
 this is a special kind of people all sang with 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:06.750
 hand it was replaced that there will be such a game 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.900
 very hard not to the prince and two goals 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.360
 lose 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:15.630
 second half against the strongest branches 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:17.950
 what tactics change pin down 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.830
 the fans first of all tried the guys 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:25.080
 calm and so that they themselves fled 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:30.870
 straightened bills your methodically 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:33.550
 prepared their attacks + 1 that is 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.800
 asked to bounce when we write off 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.130
 concentrated that is manifested yet 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.520
 more character it is clear that these desire 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:47.210
 new look at 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:57.190
 although they gave rest of course would very much 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:59.570
 and so much you did fool 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.150
 Similarly, the question is only in other goods 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.190
 but play the wind first half 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.810
 second half of the activity because 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.870
 Nicholas food calmly only sandler 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.210
 Screaming ours to coefficient 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:16.820
 chairs 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:19.330
 Generally, I already can not 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.060
 to say that you were mistaken just like you 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.890
 righteous no counterattack 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.470
 lost soup olga 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:30.440
 every single element of the fight we are all 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.800
 lost therefore difficult and this 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.800
 case 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:44.470
 this special idea was the end of the game 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:48.200
 bring out the Hebrew language leader so here's a nickname 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.819
 by size to it and because that 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.590
 there or us specifically guys 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:56.290
 overdone emotions overwhelmed 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.880
 same 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.070
 so no one wanted to give in until 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.550
 I wanted to lose the position so many times 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.940
 was being treated for something to infer from 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.110
 myself 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.670
 my skills there don't even know what they removed 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:16.600
 talked back banged and what a 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:16.600
 it didnâ€™t delete banged them nobody cursed 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.490
 what's done is done to protest on 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.490
 refereeing 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:33.190
 the next cave after the start 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.730
 destroyed to utter 2 will be released 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.800
 in the second half we even noted that 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.450
 after the game of course it's unpleasant that 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.010
 all the same 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.790
 so let's say pay more attention to 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.040
 what 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:50.980
 not to miss accordingly 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:53.570
 catch the words head us get 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.550
 no one will refuse we will of course 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.490
 it is better 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:02.530
 I wanted to skip the nearest one often 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.530
 the game makes up our less wrong 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.860
 another question thanks
