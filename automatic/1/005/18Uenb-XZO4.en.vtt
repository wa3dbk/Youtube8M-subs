hello<00:00:00.599> today<00:00:01.410> I'm<00:00:01.469> going<00:00:01.560> to<00:00:01.650> show<00:00:01.770> you<00:00:01.829> how

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
hello today I'm going to show you how

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.700 
hello today I'm going to show you how
you<00:00:02.159> can<00:00:02.340> actually<00:00:02.520> use<00:00:02.820> vector<00:00:03.480> files<00:00:03.870> on<00:00:04.230> the

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
you can actually use vector files on the

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.280 
you can actually use vector files on the
web<00:00:04.950> and<00:00:05.540> the<00:00:06.540> biggest<00:00:06.899> difference<00:00:07.080> between

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
web and the biggest difference between

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.160 
web and the biggest difference between
vector<00:00:07.919> and<00:00:07.950> raster<00:00:08.130> files<00:00:08.760> is<00:00:09.120> that<00:00:09.719> a<00:00:09.840> vector

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
vector and raster files is that a vector

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.190 
vector and raster files is that a vector
file<00:00:10.679> can<00:00:11.519> be<00:00:11.550> scaled<00:00:12.030> up<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.240> any<00:00:12.780> size

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
file can be scaled up to any size

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.129 
file can be scaled up to any size
without<00:00:13.650> losing<00:00:14.070> quality<00:00:14.660> whereas<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.690> raster

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
without losing quality whereas a raster

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.290 
without losing quality whereas a raster
file<00:00:16.410> is<00:00:16.710> composed<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.880> all<00:00:18.000> these<00:00:18.180> little

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
file is composed of all these little

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.019 
file is composed of all these little
pixels<00:00:18.779> so<00:00:19.050> as<00:00:19.230> you<00:00:19.470> scale<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:19.890> up<00:00:19.949> in<00:00:20.100> size<00:00:20.340> the

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
pixels so as you scale it up in size the

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.970 
pixels so as you scale it up in size the
pixels<00:00:21.510> that<00:00:21.660> it's<00:00:21.810> made<00:00:22.020> up<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.380> become

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
pixels that it's made up of become

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.650 
pixels that it's made up of become
bigger<00:00:23.160> bigger<00:00:23.490> so<00:00:23.850> you<00:00:23.910> know<00:00:24.210> we've<00:00:24.359> all<00:00:24.449> seen

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
bigger bigger so you know we've all seen

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.750 
bigger bigger so you know we've all seen
pixelated<00:00:25.230> images<00:00:25.590> that's<00:00:26.250> what<00:00:26.460> happens

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
pixelated images that's what happens

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.080 
pixelated images that's what happens
when<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.029> scale<00:00:27.390> up<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:28.099> small<00:00:29.099> file<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:29.939> is<00:00:30.060> a

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
when you scale up a small file that is a

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.930 
when you scale up a small file that is a
raster<00:00:30.420> file<00:00:30.840> where<00:00:31.590> as<00:00:31.679> vector<00:00:32.009> files<00:00:32.279> the

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
raster file where as vector files the

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.120 
raster file where as vector files the
file<00:00:33.360> is<00:00:33.540> actually<00:00:33.960> like<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.380> ton<00:00:35.100> of

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
file is actually like a ton of

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.920 
file is actually like a ton of
mathematical<00:00:35.910> equations<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.630> stuff<00:00:36.750> that

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
mathematical equations and stuff that

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.150 
mathematical equations and stuff that
tell<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.739> program<00:00:38.610> how<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:39.960> math<00:00:40.320> renders

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
tell a program how that math renders

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.700 
tell a program how that math renders
into<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.520> shape<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.840> instead<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.140> being<00:00:43.350> pixel

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
into a shape so instead of being pixel

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.279 
into a shape so instead of being pixel
data<00:00:43.860> it's<00:00:44.129> actually<00:00:44.309> like<00:00:44.700> math<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.360> how<00:00:45.539> the

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
data it's actually like math of how the

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.930 
data it's actually like math of how the
curves<00:00:46.559> work<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.100> how<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.219> colors<00:00:47.579> work<00:00:47.789> and

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
curves work and how the colors work and

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.850 
curves work and how the colors work and
that<00:00:48.030> sort<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.239> thing<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:49.320> there<00:00:49.590> are<00:00:49.710> what

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
that sort of thing and so there are what

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.549 
that sort of thing and so there are what
are<00:00:49.890> called<00:00:50.090> SVG<00:00:51.090> files<00:00:51.510> which<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.440> can

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
are called SVG files which you can

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.889 
are called SVG files which you can
actually<00:00:52.649> use<00:00:53.010> on<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.460> web<00:00:53.610> as<00:00:53.899> scalable

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
actually use on the web as scalable

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.010 
actually use on the web as scalable
vector<00:00:55.110> graphics<00:00:55.770> SVG<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:57.690> can<00:00:57.840> create

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
vector graphics SVG and you can create

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.040 
vector graphics SVG and you can create
these<00:00:58.320> in<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.500> program<00:00:58.890> like<00:00:59.039> illustrator<00:00:59.370> and

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
these in a program like illustrator and

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.970 
these in a program like illustrator and
you<00:01:01.050> can't<00:01:01.260> really<00:01:01.469> create<00:01:01.620> them<00:01:01.770> in<00:01:01.859> that

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
you can't really create them in that

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.189 
you can't really create them in that
many<00:01:02.129> other<00:01:02.309> programs<00:01:02.730> but<00:01:03.149> if<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.989> have<00:01:04.170> a

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
many other programs but if you have a

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.170 
many other programs but if you have a
vector<00:01:04.559> logo<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.159> illustrator<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.700> can<00:01:05.909> save

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
vector logo in illustrator you can save

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.420 
vector logo in illustrator you can save
it<00:01:06.299> as<00:01:06.360> an<00:01:06.510> SVG<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:07.260> use<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.979> on<00:01:08.159> your<00:01:08.280> own

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
it as an SVG and use it on your own

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.880 
it as an SVG and use it on your own
website<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:09.170> I'm<00:01:10.170> going<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.380> show<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.560> real

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
website so I'm going to show you real

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.380 
website so I'm going to show you real
quick<00:01:11.070> how<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.250> do<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.520> it's<00:01:11.670> very<00:01:11.790> easy<00:01:11.880> and

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
quick how to do that it's very easy and

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.660 
quick how to do that it's very easy and
it's<00:01:12.479> very<00:01:12.540> supported<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.920> won't<00:01:14.250> work<00:01:14.400> in

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
it's very supported it won't work in

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.749 
it's very supported it won't work in
Internet<00:01:15.150> Explorer<00:01:15.450> 7<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.020> earlier<00:01:16.610> so<00:01:17.610> if

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
Internet Explorer 7 and earlier so if

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.100 
Internet Explorer 7 and earlier so if
you<00:01:17.850> have<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.060> lot<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.299> clients<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.780> aren't

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
you have a lot of clients that aren't

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.539 
you have a lot of clients that aren't
quite<00:01:19.320> up<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.560> date<00:01:19.740> yet<00:01:20.070> with<00:01:20.220> Internet

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
quite up to date yet with Internet

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.020 
quite up to date yet with Internet
Explorer<00:01:20.909> updating<00:01:21.570> then<00:01:22.490> SVG<00:01:23.490> might<00:01:23.759> not<00:01:23.939> be

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
Explorer updating then SVG might not be

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.469 
Explorer updating then SVG might not be
the<00:01:24.150> way<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.270> go<00:01:25.369> but<00:01:26.369> otherwise<00:01:26.580> it's<00:01:27.330> great

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
the way to go but otherwise it's great

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.870 
the way to go but otherwise it's great
and<00:01:27.780> what's<00:01:28.740> so<00:01:28.920> cool<00:01:28.950> about<00:01:29.220> these<00:01:29.490> vector

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
and what's so cool about these vector

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.569 
and what's so cool about these vector
graphics<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.600> they're<00:01:31.530> very<00:01:31.560> small<00:01:32.220> file

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
graphics is that they're very small file

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.490 
graphics is that they're very small file
size<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:33.509> if<00:01:33.630> you're<00:01:33.750> having<00:01:33.930> like<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.140> huge

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
size so if you're having like a huge

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.109 
size so if you're having like a huge
image<00:01:34.740> in<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.189> background<00:01:35.579> or<00:01:35.700> like<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.850> big

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
image in the background or like a big

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.910 
image in the background or like a big
image<00:01:36.329> in<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.540> page<00:01:36.720> you're<00:01:37.439> going<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.650> save<00:01:37.890> a

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
image in the page you're going to save a

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.649 
image in the page you're going to save a
lot<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.280> load<00:01:38.670> time<00:01:38.939> for<00:01:39.180> your<00:01:39.299> visitors

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
lot of load time for your visitors

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:40.940 
lot of load time for your visitors
because<00:01:39.869> they're<00:01:40.110> not<00:01:40.229> loading<00:01:40.530> this<00:01:40.619> huge

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
because they're not loading this huge

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.580 
because they're not loading this huge
huge<00:01:41.220> vector<00:01:41.759> or<00:01:41.909> sorry<00:01:42.180> raster<00:01:42.540> image<00:01:42.810> so

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
huge vector or sorry raster image so

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.630 
huge vector or sorry raster image so
here<00:01:44.430> in<00:01:44.549> Illustrator<00:01:45.060> I've<00:01:45.360> got<00:01:45.990> this<00:01:46.640> police

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
here in Illustrator I've got this police

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.690 
here in Illustrator I've got this police
badge<00:01:47.880> with<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.149> cool<00:01:48.560> swatch<00:01:49.560> gradient<00:01:50.549> a

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
badge with a cool swatch gradient a

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.819 
badge with a cool swatch gradient a
swirly<00:01:51.659> thing<00:01:51.869> on<00:01:52.049> it

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
swirly thing on it

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.200 
swirly thing on it
and<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.399> did<00:01:53.549> this<00:01:53.670> just<00:01:53.880> because<00:01:54.030> it's<00:01:54.180> a

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
and I did this just because it's a

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.670 
and I did this just because it's a
little<00:01:54.390> more<00:01:54.540> complex<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.290> we'll<00:01:55.380> give<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:55.590> an

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
little more complex so we'll give you an

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.100 
little more complex so we'll give you an
example<00:01:55.920> what<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.219> more<00:01:56.430> complex<00:01:57.030> kind<00:01:57.960> of

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
example what a more complex kind of

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.219 
example what a more complex kind of
shape<00:01:58.710> looks<00:01:59.070> like<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.600> I'm<00:02:00.600> going<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:00.960> save

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
shape looks like and I'm going to save

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.080 
shape looks like and I'm going to save
that<00:02:01.259> as<00:02:01.590> an<00:02:01.770> SVG<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:02.399> already<00:02:02.640> have<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.909> saved

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
that as an SVG I already have it saved

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.480 
that as an SVG I already have it saved
as<00:02:03.390> just<00:02:03.600> an<00:02:03.750> illustrator<00:02:04.170> file<00:02:04.409> so<00:02:05.250> if<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.369> go

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
as just an illustrator file so if I go

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.260 
as just an illustrator file so if I go
to<00:02:05.549> file<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.719> then<00:02:06.810> save<00:02:07.140> as<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:08.060> can<00:02:09.060> choose

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
to file and then save as I can choose

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.589 
to file and then save as I can choose
type<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.840> choose<00:02:10.110> SVG<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.360> again<00:02:12.360> it's<00:02:12.540> just

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
type and choose SVG and again it's just

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.410 
type and choose SVG and again it's just
on<00:02:12.780> my<00:02:12.870> desktop

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
on my desktop

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.920 
on my desktop
so<00:02:15.420> for<00:02:15.689> fonts<00:02:16.110> um<00:02:16.769> I<00:02:17.730> would<00:02:18.239> say<00:02:18.269> convert<00:02:18.840> it

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
so for fonts um I would say convert it

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.170 
so for fonts um I would say convert it
to<00:02:18.989> outline<00:02:19.470> so<00:02:20.159> that<00:02:20.310> it's<00:02:20.430> not<00:02:20.610> actually<00:02:21.060> in

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
to outline so that it's not actually in

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.979 
to outline so that it's not actually in
there<00:02:21.299> as<00:02:21.450> text<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:23.450> this<00:02:24.450> is<00:02:24.599> a<00:02:24.629> good<00:02:24.810> thing

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
there as text and this is a good thing

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.479 
there as text and this is a good thing
to<00:02:25.110> do<00:02:25.230> because<00:02:25.379> then<00:02:25.650> it's<00:02:25.799> not<00:02:25.980> loading<00:02:26.370> as

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
to do because then it's not loading as

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.059 
to do because then it's not loading as
much<00:02:26.670> however<00:02:27.450> we<00:02:28.379> see<00:02:28.560> in<00:02:28.650> our<00:02:28.769> little

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
much however we see in our little

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.119 
much however we see in our little
descriptor<00:02:29.909> down<00:02:30.060> there<00:02:30.269> that<00:02:31.140> small<00:02:31.590> outline

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
descriptor down there that small outline

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.160 
descriptor down there that small outline
text<00:02:32.640> might<00:02:32.819> not<00:02:32.970> be<00:02:33.090> accurately<00:02:33.450> preserved

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
text might not be accurately preserved

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.210 
text might not be accurately preserved
so<00:02:34.349> let's<00:02:34.470> look<00:02:34.530> at<00:02:34.650> some<00:02:34.739> of<00:02:34.829> the<00:02:34.890> other<00:02:35.010> stuff

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
so let's look at some of the other stuff

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.080 
so let's look at some of the other stuff
we<00:02:35.310> can<00:02:35.459> do<00:02:35.900> it<00:02:36.900> looks<00:02:37.170> like<00:02:37.790> SVG<00:02:38.790> is<00:02:38.939> the

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
we can do it looks like SVG is the

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.390 
we can do it looks like SVG is the
standard<00:02:39.540> but<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:40.349> says<00:02:40.560> that<00:02:40.739> small<00:02:40.980> text<00:02:41.310> is

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
standard but it says that small text is

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.050 
standard but it says that small text is
also<00:02:41.760> an<00:02:41.849> issue<00:02:42.709> whereas<00:02:43.709> the<00:02:43.859> Adobe<00:02:44.250> CC<00:02:44.489> F<00:02:44.849> is

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
also an issue whereas the Adobe CC F is

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.720 
also an issue whereas the Adobe CC F is
apparently<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.480> most<00:02:48.900> best-looking<00:02:49.889> way<00:02:50.220> to

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
apparently the most best-looking way to

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.430 
apparently the most best-looking way to
do<00:02:50.819> fonts<00:02:51.180> but<00:02:51.510> it's<00:02:51.629> not<00:02:51.720> very<00:02:51.840> supported<00:02:52.290> so

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
do fonts but it's not very supported so

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.259 
do fonts but it's not very supported so
for<00:02:52.709> me<00:02:52.829> I'm<00:02:53.069> going<00:02:53.459> to<00:02:53.489> convert<00:02:53.819> it<00:02:53.940> to<00:02:53.970> an<00:02:54.150> app

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
for me I'm going to convert it to an app

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.789 
for me I'm going to convert it to an app
line<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:55.459> for<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.639> image<00:02:57.030> location

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
line and for the image location

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.679 
line and for the image location
basically<00:02:58.799> if<00:02:59.099> you<00:02:59.489> are<00:02:59.730> embedding<00:03:00.239> the<00:03:00.450> image

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:00.689 
basically if you are embedding the image

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:05.050 
basically if you are embedding the image
as<00:03:00.840> an<00:03:01.170> actual<00:03:01.470> image<00:03:01.650> you'll<00:03:02.280> choose<00:03:02.579> embed

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.949 

or<00:03:06.060> you<00:03:06.269> can<00:03:06.389> do<00:03:06.480> it<00:03:06.599> as<00:03:06.689> a<00:03:06.720> link<00:03:07.049> and<00:03:07.579> I

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
or you can do it as a link and I

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.300 
or you can do it as a link and I
personally<00:03:09.959> I<00:03:09.989> mean<00:03:10.139> like<00:03:10.319> it's<00:03:10.470> kind<00:03:10.680> of<00:03:10.799> it

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
personally I mean like it's kind of it

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.740 
personally I mean like it's kind of it
goes<00:03:11.489> back<00:03:11.670> and<00:03:11.819> forth<00:03:12.000> but<00:03:12.180> I<00:03:12.299> kind<00:03:12.540> of<00:03:12.599> like

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
goes back and forth but I kind of like

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.780 
goes back and forth but I kind of like
linking<00:03:13.200> because<00:03:14.040> it's<00:03:14.370> a<00:03:14.430> little<00:03:14.670> bit

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
linking because it's a little bit

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.240 
linking because it's a little bit
smaller<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.769> you'll<00:03:16.769> just<00:03:16.920> have<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.129> mess

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
smaller and you'll just have to mess

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.909 
smaller and you'll just have to mess
with<00:03:17.370> it<00:03:17.489> that's<00:03:17.699> the<00:03:17.819> thing<00:03:18.000> about<00:03:18.290> SVG<00:03:19.290> files

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:19.919 
with it that's the thing about SVG files

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:21.170 
with it that's the thing about SVG files
and<00:03:20.160> stuff<00:03:20.340> is<00:03:20.489> that<00:03:20.609> a<00:03:20.639> lot<00:03:20.819> of<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:20.970> time<00:03:21.120> you

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
and stuff is that a lot of the time you

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.369 
and stuff is that a lot of the time you
just<00:03:21.299> have<00:03:21.359> to<00:03:21.569> try<00:03:21.750> it<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:22.019> see<00:03:22.079> what<00:03:22.290> you

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 
just have to try it and see what you

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:22.580 
just have to try it and see what you
like

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
like

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.509 
like
so<00:03:23.459> if<00:03:23.549> I<00:03:23.609> click<00:03:23.819> link<00:03:24.090> and<00:03:24.299> then<00:03:24.389> click<00:03:24.569> OK<00:03:24.870> and

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
so if I click link and then click OK and

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.890 
so if I click link and then click OK and
I<00:03:26.519> go<00:03:26.699> to<00:03:26.760> my<00:03:27.060> desktop<00:03:28.609> I<00:03:29.609> see<00:03:30.510> right<00:03:30.690> here

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
I go to my desktop I see right here

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.789 
I go to my desktop I see right here
there's<00:03:31.739> this<00:03:31.949> SVG<00:03:32.549> document<00:03:33.470> and<00:03:34.470> one<00:03:34.620> thing

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
there's this SVG document and one thing

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.500 
there's this SVG document and one thing
I<00:03:34.889> want<00:03:35.069> you<00:03:35.099> to<00:03:35.159> note<00:03:35.430> right<00:03:35.639> off<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.150> bat<00:03:36.329> is

I want you to note right off the bat is

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.020 
I want you to note right off the bat is
it's<00:03:36.750> 166<00:03:37.709> kilobytes<00:03:38.810> if<00:03:39.810> I<00:03:40.169> were<00:03:40.319> to<00:03:41.030> take

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
it's 166 kilobytes if I were to take

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.979 
it's 166 kilobytes if I were to take
this<00:03:42.299> from<00:03:43.079> illustrator<00:03:44.359> copy<00:03:45.359> it<00:03:45.599> into<00:03:45.810> like

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
this from illustrator copy it into like

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.129 
this from illustrator copy it into like
a<00:03:46.019> new<00:03:46.229> Photoshop<00:03:46.709> file<00:03:47.720> you<00:03:48.720> see<00:03:48.930> I<00:03:48.959> was

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
a new Photoshop file you see I was

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:52.099 
a new Photoshop file you see I was
looking<00:03:49.379> for<00:03:49.500> generic<00:03:49.829> logos<00:03:50.780> and<00:03:51.780> let's<00:03:51.959> say

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
looking for generic logos and let's say

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.710 
looking for generic logos and let's say
that<00:03:52.139> I<00:03:52.260> made<00:03:52.440> it<00:03:52.530> large<00:03:52.769> like<00:03:53.449> even<00:03:54.449> as<00:03:54.569> big<00:03:54.659> as

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
that I made it large like even as big as

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.390 
that I made it large like even as big as
a<00:03:54.870> thousand<00:03:55.260> pixels<00:03:55.409> oops<00:03:57.769> and<00:03:58.769> I<00:03:58.859> saved<00:03:59.129> it<00:03:59.220> as

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
a thousand pixels oops and I saved it as

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.979 
a thousand pixels oops and I saved it as
I<00:03:59.639> don't<00:03:59.849> know<00:03:59.909> a<00:03:59.940> JPEG<00:04:00.419> which<00:04:00.629> is<00:04:00.780> a<00:04:00.810> pretty

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
I don't know a JPEG which is a pretty

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:06.140 
I don't know a JPEG which is a pretty
compressed<00:04:01.379> size<00:04:01.560> to<00:04:01.829> the<00:04:01.919> desktop

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.550 

and<00:04:07.790> let's<00:04:08.790> say<00:04:08.940> I<00:04:08.970> had<00:04:09.180> it<00:04:09.269> at<00:04:09.360> 8<00:04:09.569> as<00:04:10.049> the

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
and let's say I had it at 8 as the

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:17.140 
and let's say I had it at 8 as the
quality<00:04:14.540> we<00:04:15.540> see<00:04:15.720> that<00:04:15.870> that's<00:04:15.989> 170<00:04:16.680> kilobytes

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
quality we see that that's 170 kilobytes

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:22.280 
quality we see that that's 170 kilobytes
versus<00:04:18.150> on<00:04:18.269> in<00:04:18.389> 66<00:04:18.989> so<00:04:20.780> anything<00:04:21.780> larger<00:04:22.260> than

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
versus on in 66 so anything larger than

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.800 
versus on in 66 so anything larger than
this<00:04:22.710> is<00:04:23.040> going<00:04:23.580> to<00:04:23.850> be<00:04:23.940> much<00:04:24.090> larger<00:04:24.330> for<00:04:24.690> this

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
this is going to be much larger for this

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.650 
this is going to be much larger for this
file<00:04:25.050> for<00:04:25.620> the<00:04:25.680> JPEG<00:04:26.040> whereas<00:04:26.970> with<00:04:27.180> the<00:04:27.300> SVG

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
file for the JPEG whereas with the SVG

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.020 
file for the JPEG whereas with the SVG
it<00:04:28.080> doesn't<00:04:28.410> matter<00:04:28.560> how<00:04:28.740> big<00:04:28.919> it<00:04:28.979> gets<00:04:29.190> so<00:04:29.970> you

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
it doesn't matter how big it gets so you

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.240 
it doesn't matter how big it gets so you
can<00:04:30.389> meet<00:04:30.540> maintain<00:04:31.050> a<00:04:31.080> very<00:04:31.260> small<00:04:31.620> file<00:04:31.919> size

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
can meet maintain a very small file size

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.120 
can meet maintain a very small file size
for<00:04:32.280> a<00:04:32.639> very<00:04:32.850> very<00:04:33.150> large<00:04:33.360> file<00:04:33.720> and<00:04:33.960> in<00:04:34.889> terms

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
for a very very large file and in terms

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.159 
for a very very large file and in terms
of<00:04:35.280> how<00:04:35.400> it<00:04:35.550> works<00:04:35.760> let's<00:04:36.660> say<00:04:36.840> I<00:04:36.870> go<00:04:37.020> into

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
of how it works let's say I go into

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.050 
of how it works let's say I go into
Dreamweaver<00:04:37.320> I<00:04:37.919> have<00:04:38.460> this<00:04:38.580> one<00:04:38.789> I<00:04:38.820> was<00:04:39.000> using

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
Dreamweaver I have this one I was using

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.750 
Dreamweaver I have this one I was using
earlier<00:04:39.570> for<00:04:39.750> another<00:04:39.930> video<00:04:40.310> this<00:04:41.310> one<00:04:41.520> saved

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
earlier for another video this one saved

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.360 
earlier for another video this one saved
on<00:04:41.910> the<00:04:42.000> desktop<00:04:42.120> and<00:04:42.740> so<00:04:43.740> it<00:04:43.830> works<00:04:44.039> just<00:04:44.310> like

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
on the desktop and so it works just like

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.610 
on the desktop and so it works just like
any<00:04:44.460> other<00:04:44.760> image<00:04:45.060> you<00:04:45.780> can<00:04:45.960> just<00:04:46.110> do<00:04:46.229> image

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
any other image you can just do image

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.409 
any other image you can just do image
source<00:04:47.310> equals<00:04:48.860> and<00:04:49.880> this<00:04:50.880> is<00:04:51.000> what<00:04:51.120> I<00:04:51.150> called

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
source equals and this is what I called

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:55.969 
source equals and this is what I called
it<00:04:52.280> it's<00:04:53.280> called<00:04:53.550> it<00:04:53.669> logo<00:04:53.970> to<00:04:54.030> SVG<00:04:54.630> so<00:04:54.979> logo

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
it it's called it logo to SVG so logo

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:57.950 
it it's called it logo to SVG so logo
dot<00:04:56.340> SVG<00:04:57.150> since<00:04:57.479> they're<00:04:57.600> both<00:04:57.720> on<00:04:57.930> the

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
dot SVG since they're both on the

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.740 
dot SVG since they're both on the
desktop<00:04:58.410> and<00:04:59.280> then<00:04:59.370> close<00:04:59.610> that<00:04:59.850> tag<00:05:00.090> and<00:05:00.330> it

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
desktop and then close that tag and it

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.210 
desktop and then close that tag and it
has<00:05:00.870> it<00:05:01.020> here<00:05:01.260> all<00:05:01.470> dinky<00:05:01.919> you<00:05:02.039> have<00:05:02.160> to

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
has it here all dinky you have to

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.439 
has it here all dinky you have to
actually<00:05:02.340> preview<00:05:02.789> and<00:05:02.910> browser<00:05:03.060> before<00:05:03.240> you

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:03.449 
actually preview and browser before you

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:07.610 
actually preview and browser before you
can<00:05:03.570> see<00:05:03.720> it<00:05:04.850> let's<00:05:05.850> do<00:05:06.060> it<00:05:06.090> at<00:05:06.300> let's<00:05:06.510> say<00:05:06.720> 500

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
can see it let's do it at let's say 500

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:08.330 
can see it let's do it at let's say 500
by<00:05:07.680> 500

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
by 500

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:14.420 
by 500
so<00:05:08.460> width<00:05:08.750> equals<00:05:09.750> 500<00:05:10.370> height<00:05:12.020> 500<00:05:13.099> so<00:05:14.099> I<00:05:14.130> save

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
so width equals 500 height 500 so I save

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.800 
so width equals 500 height 500 so I save
this<00:05:14.580> and<00:05:14.729> I<00:05:14.760> preview<00:05:15.030> in<00:05:15.120> the<00:05:15.150> browser<00:05:15.210> look

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
this and I preview in the browser look

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.870 
this and I preview in the browser look
at<00:05:15.930> that<00:05:16.080> we've<00:05:16.889> got<00:05:17.070> our<00:05:17.190> vector<00:05:17.460> image<00:05:17.729> how

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
at that we've got our vector image how

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.990 
at that we've got our vector image how
hard<00:05:18.120> was<00:05:18.270> that<00:05:18.380> not<00:05:19.380> very<00:05:19.620> hard<00:05:19.889> and<00:05:20.070> what's

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
hard was that not very hard and what's

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.969 
hard was that not very hard and what's
so<00:05:21.180> cool<00:05:21.210> let's<00:05:21.630> say<00:05:21.780> I<00:05:21.810> had<00:05:22.020> some<00:05:22.289> weird<00:05:22.620> need

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979 
so cool let's say I had some weird need

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:25.400 
so cool let's say I had some weird need
to<00:05:23.190> make<00:05:23.310> it<00:05:23.430> 5,000<00:05:24.210> by<00:05:24.300> 5,000<00:05:24.960> or<00:05:25.139> something

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
to make it 5,000 by 5,000 or something

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.420 
to make it 5,000 by 5,000 or something
like<00:05:25.560> that<00:05:27.080> we<00:05:28.080> can<00:05:28.200> see<00:05:28.380> that<00:05:28.530> it<00:05:28.620> still<00:05:28.889> pixel

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
like that we can see that it still pixel

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.879 
like that we can see that it still pixel
perfect<00:05:29.700> detail<00:05:30.539> on<00:05:31.020> all<00:05:31.320> of<00:05:31.470> these<00:05:31.620> shapes

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:31.889 
perfect detail on all of these shapes

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:35.150 
perfect detail on all of these shapes
which<00:05:32.820> is<00:05:33.000> just<00:05:33.240> so<00:05:33.479> freakin<00:05:34.110> cool<00:05:34.380> in<00:05:34.949> my

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
which is just so freakin cool in my

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.100 
which is just so freakin cool in my
opinion<00:05:35.639> that<00:05:35.789> you<00:05:36.270> can<00:05:36.510> have<00:05:36.690> all<00:05:36.810> this<00:05:36.930> so

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
opinion that you can have all this so

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.600 
opinion that you can have all this so
it'd<00:05:37.199> be<00:05:37.229> great<00:05:37.590> for<00:05:37.800> website<00:05:38.190> background

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
it'd be great for website background

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.659 
it'd be great for website background
textures<00:05:39.030> and<00:05:39.860> it's<00:05:40.860> just<00:05:41.070> it's<00:05:41.250> really<00:05:41.310> nice

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
textures and it's just it's really nice

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:44.029 
textures and it's just it's really nice
because<00:05:42.080> let's<00:05:43.080> say<00:05:43.229> you're<00:05:43.410> reusing<00:05:44.010> your

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 
because let's say you're reusing your

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:46.490 
because let's say you're reusing your
logo<00:05:44.639> five<00:05:45.539> different<00:05:45.750> times<00:05:46.050> on<00:05:46.169> your<00:05:46.320> site

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
logo five different times on your site

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.890 
logo five different times on your site
in<00:05:46.740> multiple<00:05:47.160> different<00:05:47.310> sizes<00:05:47.880> well<00:05:48.570> if<00:05:48.780> you

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
in multiple different sizes well if you

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.080 
in multiple different sizes well if you
have<00:05:49.110> five<00:05:49.500> separate<00:05:49.949> JPEGs<00:05:50.430> that<00:05:50.610> people<00:05:51.000> are

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
have five separate JPEGs that people are

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.060 
have five separate JPEGs that people are
loading<00:05:51.479> they're<00:05:52.410> gonna<00:05:52.560> have<00:05:52.680> to<00:05:52.740> load<00:05:52.889> five

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070 
loading they're gonna have to load five

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.430 
loading they're gonna have to load five
separate<00:05:53.340> files<00:05:53.580> whereas<00:05:54.510> if<00:05:54.720> you<00:05:54.900> have<00:05:55.050> one

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
separate files whereas if you have one

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.620 
separate files whereas if you have one
SVG<00:05:56.010> file<00:05:56.250> that<00:05:56.490> you<00:05:56.580> simply<00:05:56.789> display<00:05:57.419> at

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
SVG file that you simply display at

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.839 
SVG file that you simply display at
different<00:05:57.930> sizes<00:05:58.320> the<00:05:58.800> users<00:05:59.130> only<00:05:59.639> ever

00:05:59.839 --> 00:05:59.849 
different sizes the users only ever

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:02.300 
different sizes the users only ever
loading<00:06:00.360> one<00:06:00.599> file<00:06:00.870> and<00:06:01.169> so<00:06:01.770> when<00:06:02.160> their

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
loading one file and so when their

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.790 
loading one file and so when their
browser<00:06:02.520> caches<00:06:03.240> that<00:06:03.479> file<00:06:03.810> it<00:06:04.110> means<00:06:04.680> that

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
browser caches that file it means that

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.320 
browser caches that file it means that
their<00:06:04.919> load<00:06:05.099> time<00:06:05.370> is<00:06:05.400> going<00:06:05.789> to<00:06:05.849> be<00:06:05.970> decreased

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
their load time is going to be decreased

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.000 
their load time is going to be decreased
because<00:06:06.570> they<00:06:06.810> don't<00:06:06.960> have<00:06:07.110> to<00:06:07.289> load<00:06:07.830> that

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.010 
because they don't have to load that

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.520 
because they don't have to load that
image<00:06:08.250> again<00:06:08.370> so<00:06:09.150> there's<00:06:09.900> a<00:06:09.960> quick<00:06:10.229> little

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530 
image again so there's a quick little

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.830 
image again so there's a quick little
rundown<00:06:10.680> of<00:06:10.889> SVG's<00:06:11.370> again<00:06:11.760> they're<00:06:12.300> very<00:06:12.599> cool

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
rundown of SVG's again they're very cool

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:13.879 
rundown of SVG's again they're very cool
you<00:06:13.050> have<00:06:13.229> to<00:06:13.260> have<00:06:13.470> something<00:06:13.680> like

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:13.889 
you have to have something like

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:15.190 
you have to have something like
illustrator<00:06:14.159> to<00:06:14.520> do<00:06:14.700> it<00:06:14.820> unfortunately

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:15.200 
illustrator to do it unfortunately

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.330 
illustrator to do it unfortunately
because<00:06:16.200> otherwise<00:06:16.770> you<00:06:16.979> don't<00:06:17.130> have<00:06:17.250> the

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
because otherwise you don't have the

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:17.660 
because otherwise you don't have the
vector

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:17.670 
vector

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:20.240 
vector
I'll<00:06:17.820> begin<00:06:17.970> with<00:06:18.210> so<00:06:18.900> best<00:06:19.410> of<00:06:19.530> luck<00:06:19.590> if<00:06:20.160> you
