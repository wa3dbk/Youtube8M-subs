program<00:00:18.330> called<00:00:18.570> notepad<00:00:19.170> plus<00:00:19.439> plus<00:00:19.470> the

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
program called notepad plus plus the

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.000 
program called notepad plus plus the
link<00:00:20.160> for<00:00:20.490> that<00:00:20.550> will<00:00:20.820> be<00:00:21.060> in<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.300> description

now<00:00:23.010> that<00:00:23.250> you've<00:00:23.400> got<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:24.560> it's<00:00:25.560> been

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
now that you've got that it's been

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.529 
now that you've got that it's been
literally<00:00:26.189> seconds<00:00:26.640> but<00:00:26.820> you've<00:00:26.970> got<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.390> now

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
literally seconds but you've got it now

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.330 
literally seconds but you've got it now
you<00:00:27.779> need<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.800> find<00:00:28.949> your<00:00:29.099> steam<00:00:29.310> folder

you need to find your steam folder

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.630 
you need to find your steam folder
usually<00:00:30.210> it's<00:00:30.570> in<00:00:30.720> c<00:00:31.019> program<00:00:31.470> files<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:32.130> then

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
usually it's in c program files and then

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.910 
usually it's in c program files and then
steam<00:00:32.940> or<00:00:33.210> steam<00:00:33.480> powered<00:00:33.809> but<00:00:34.530> in<00:00:34.710> my<00:00:34.860> case

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
steam or steam powered but in my case

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.740 
steam or steam powered but in my case
i've<00:00:35.370> installed<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.880> in<00:00:35.969> another<00:00:36.239> directory

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
i've installed it in another directory

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.020 
i've installed it in another directory
so<00:00:36.960> if<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.380> know<00:00:37.500> what<00:00:37.710> for<00:00:38.430> example<00:00:38.760> let's

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
so if you know what for example let's

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.340 
so if you know what for example let's
say<00:00:39.120> you've<00:00:39.239> got<00:00:39.390> several<00:00:39.780> hard<00:00:39.989> drives<00:00:40.170> if

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
say you've got several hard drives if

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.990 
say you've got several hard drives if
you<00:00:40.440> know<00:00:40.559> what<00:00:40.710> hard<00:00:40.890> drive<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.280> find<00:00:41.910> that

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
you know what hard drive is find that

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.930 
you know what hard drive is find that
later<00:00:42.540> of<00:00:42.780> hard<00:00:42.989> drive<00:00:43.170> then<00:00:43.680> go<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:43.950> Program

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
later of hard drive then go to Program

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.990 
later of hard drive then go to Program
Files<00:00:45.260> then<00:00:46.260> go<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.649> steam<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.399> steam<00:00:47.670> powered

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
Files then go to steam a steam powered

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000 
Files then go to steam a steam powered
and<00:00:48.300> then<00:00:49.020> go<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.289> steam<00:00:49.620> apps<00:00:49.820> and<00:00:50.820> then<00:00:51.629> go<00:00:51.899> to

and then go to steam apps and then go to
common<00:00:53.010> within<00:00:54.000> there<00:00:54.360> you'll<00:00:54.600> find<00:00:54.750> your<00:00:54.870> f1

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
common within there you'll find your f1

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
this one here being one now in my

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.969 
this one here being one now in my
opinion<00:01:29.100> increase<00:01:29.939> both<00:01:30.810> by<00:01:31.110> maybe<00:01:31.439> one<00:01:31.740> or

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
opinion increase both by maybe one or

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.890 
opinion increase both by maybe one or
two<00:01:32.009> so<00:01:32.759> making<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.180> 1<00:01:33.659> or<00:01:33.930> 1.5<00:01:34.909> no<00:01:35.909> yeah<00:01:36.479> making

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
two so making it 1 or 1.5 no yeah making

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.780 
two so making it 1 or 1.5 no yeah making
a<00:01:37.049> 1.5<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.979> two<00:01:38.430> or<00:01:38.729> 2.5<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:40.020> three<00:01:40.619> I'm<00:01:41.460> going

a 1.5 and two or 2.5 and three I'm going

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.280 
a 1.5 and two or 2.5 and three I'm going
to<00:01:41.939> put<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.360> moon<00:01:42.720> well<00:01:42.990> I'm<00:01:43.110> gonna

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
to put it to the moon well I'm gonna

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.389 
to put it to the moon well I'm gonna
make<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.680> lot<00:01:43.829> more<00:01:43.860> than<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.250> I'm<00:01:44.310> gonna

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
make it a lot more than that I'm gonna

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.649 
make it a lot more than that I'm gonna
put<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.820> eight<00:01:45.119> point<00:01:45.450> five<00:01:45.920> and<00:01:47.240> nine<00:01:48.240> I

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
put it to eight point five and nine I

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.899 
put it to eight point five and nine I
believe<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:49.259> maximum<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.829> can<00:01:50.220> go<00:01:50.549> as<00:01:50.700> main

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
believe the maximum you can go as main

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.069 
believe the maximum you can go as main
point<00:01:51.210> name<00:01:52.009> I'm<00:01:53.009> not<00:01:53.670> sure<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.030> but<00:01:54.750> I

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
point name I'm not sure of that but I

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.719 
point name I'm not sure of that but I
think<00:01:55.290> it's<00:01:55.770> main<00:01:55.920> point<00:01:56.130> what<00:01:56.280> name<00:01:56.490> is<00:01:56.640> the

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
think it's main point what name is the

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.260 
think it's main point what name is the
max<00:01:56.909> okay<00:01:57.869> so<00:01:57.930> I'm<00:01:58.049> gonna<00:01:58.170> save<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.409> now<00:01:59.270> and

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
max okay so I'm gonna save that now and

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.109 
max okay so I'm gonna save that now and
