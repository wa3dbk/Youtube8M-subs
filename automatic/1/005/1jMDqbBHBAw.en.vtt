 Hello , the song data is very good 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.180
 suitable for beginners 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.199
 here one fight is pretty simple and 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.649
 common 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:55.739
 also quite simple chords of them here 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.559
 pretty little and no chords with 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.239
 Barre, that is, there is a newcomer in principle 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.370
 can play like that first 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.180
 Consider the chords that are in the song 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:10.380
 this is kurt m 6 strings they sound 5 string 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.659

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.289
 string on the first fret and 1 string 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:21.119
 open proud further we have a chord 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:22.289
 d em 6 5 do not sound 4 open 3 string 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.289
 on the second fret 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:27.360
 second string on the 3rd fret and 1 string on 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:30.300
 first fret 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.960
 Further, the chord is put it almost 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.240
 as well as 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.440
 am only we lift our fingers to 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.870
 above the string we play from 6 walls and still have 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.950
 g chord 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:47.490
 sixth string on 3 fret 5 on the second 4 3 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:51.540
 strings open 2 is also open and the first 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:55.440
 on the third fret and there is still a chord c 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:59.880
 6 does not sound 5 on the third fret 4 on 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:02.100
 second fret third open 2 on first 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.930
 fret and the first string is open and so 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.740
 now to the rhythmic pattern and to 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.750
 chord order put kurt m with 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.020
 he starts the song in the loser we 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:16.520

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.520

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.880

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:47.010
 The song begins with the same chord m 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:50.010
