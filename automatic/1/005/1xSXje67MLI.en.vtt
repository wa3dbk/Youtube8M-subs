00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.980
 hi friends want to share my 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.930
 experiences tell how to achieve 50 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.060
 level super fast get crying 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.099
 new parts for all your cars after all 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.840
 swing the level of all your gauge up 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.759
 maximum well or almost to 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.890
 maximum once again make a reservation 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.800
 dress new details becomes available 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.780
 only after level 50 is it the top 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.450
 the most powerful parts 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.120
 gain characteristics and since this 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.070
 do you have to jump a lot namely 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.930
 to perform a jump, let's Challenge 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:59.070
 first go to the map and filter 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:01:00.930
 task but the skill of the type of jump I have 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.180
 all radars are open and respectively 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.920
 all kinds of challenges as you see 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.979
 jumps abound and they 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.270
 concentrated mainly here 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.310
 Next, choose any church 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.530
 since you just started here the difference with 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:18.840
 what begin almost there is no 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:23.570
 some very handy here for example 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.570
 This military base will now explain why 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.070
 how do you know the challenge of challenge leap 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.100
 jumped stamp fly away for a certain 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.990
 mark in our case pay but you are so 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.700
 here on the runway you can 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.860
 cram almost any car 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.170
 do not easily jump to platinum 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.270
 by jumping you get a dress new detail 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.400
 with randomly generated levels 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.100
 way, respectively, the more and your 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:54.030
 bend the more chance the roller details 50 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.890
 level well, or at least 49 or 48 in general 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.540
 it all depends on how much 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.670
 time you are ready to spend it 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.860
 I think the distance departures for 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.860
 mark the level of detail does not affect and 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.020
 Here you have the first dress on the next 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.790
 I recommend this challenge here. 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:20.940
 history is also a lot of space to 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:22.650
 accelerate and there is no traffic but in order 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.810
 to jump on the dam on the rally 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.500
 or off-road car here is better to take 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.120
 more overclocking for example from here and 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.950
 so going over the challenge you start and 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.170
 hopping on variable on all machines 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.570
 quickly get a platinum kit 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.820
 Of course there are some challenges that 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.100
 sharpened for rally or off-road 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.500
 cars or vice versa to a greater degree 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.120
 sports or racing if your 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.520
 SUV stubbornly does not want to fly 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.160
 platinum and race car can't take 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.290
 overclocking don't despair almost everything 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.510
 platinum parts are duplicated and you 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.880
 can take pay on another challenge 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:01.550
 at this all thank you all for your attention 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.550
 I hope my mini guide helped you bye
