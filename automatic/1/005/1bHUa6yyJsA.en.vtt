00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
we've come to know over here we have

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.100 
we've come to know over here we have
this<00:01:56.729> character<00:01:57.090> line<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.390> swoops<00:01:57.509> all<00:01:57.869> the

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
way down and then rises as we go to the

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.850 
way down and then rises as we go to the
rear<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.149> we<00:02:00.420> have<00:02:00.570> this<00:02:00.719> relatively<00:02:01.229> drastic

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
rear and we have this relatively drastic

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
sloping half glass is of course

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.399 
sloping half glass is of course
reminiscent<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.909> lexus<00:02:06.299> RX<00:02:06.659> but<00:02:07.229> very

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
reminiscent of the lexus RX but very

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.529 
reminiscent of the lexus RX but very
much<00:02:07.530> like<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.950> RX<00:02:08.340> most<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:08.849> this<00:02:08.970> sloping<00:02:09.390> is

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
much like the RX most of this sloping is

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.910 
much like the RX most of this sloping is
actually<00:02:09.899> due<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.229> styling<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.860> the

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
actually due to the styling and the

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.710 
actually due to the styling and the
window<00:02:11.340> line<00:02:11.849> right<00:02:12.120> here<00:02:12.300> because<00:02:12.599> the

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
window line right here because the

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.790 
window line right here because the
actual<00:02:13.050> roof<00:02:13.200> of<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.410> vehicle

actual roof of the vehicle

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.860 
actual roof of the vehicle
is<00:02:13.860> relatively<00:02:14.610> square<00:02:15.000> really<00:02:15.510> helping<00:02:15.780> out

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
is relatively square really helping out

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.600 
is relatively square really helping out
that<00:02:16.050> interior<00:02:16.320> room<00:02:16.680> up<00:02:17.100> front<00:02:17.160> we<00:02:17.460> have<00:02:17.490> a

that interior room up front we have a

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.430 
that interior room up front we have a
decidedly<00:02:18.150> front-wheel<00:02:18.600> drive<00:02:18.750> overhang<00:02:19.260> and

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
decidedly front-wheel drive overhang and

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.510 
decidedly front-wheel drive overhang and
that's<00:02:19.590> versus<00:02:20.010> something<00:02:20.160> like<00:02:20.400> the

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
that's versus something like the

Mercedes GLK or the BMW x3 and that's
