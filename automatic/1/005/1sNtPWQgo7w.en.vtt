 we see that the driver at the mumine assembly 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.080
 so we call download now 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.259
 We accept and see the driver

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.270
 Daddy where do we want to unzip 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:46.979
 unzip from our driver this 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.700
 here is this daddy for example a new folder that 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.759
 i have here 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.829
 applets new folder so let's 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.990
 let's see what's here if there is something 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.780
 it is important here are different programs on delphi 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.909
 they are not important for us click ok and then 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.680
 place is torn unzip 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.079
 drivers 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.270
 then from this folder will be 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.190
 installed 1 our computer itself and 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.560
 so see it all happens pretty 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.220
 quickly 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.020
 I also installed the driver gadgets 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.879
 gadgets in our video card here 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.459
 load temperature is shown here 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.180
 out load 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.700
 fans are scarce how many they 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.860
 uploaded if someone wants to get 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.450
 write me the same gadget in the comments 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.090
 I will do a video review 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.610
 only if you write to you of course 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.290
 it will be interesting to do a review on that 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.450
 how to get these gadgets 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.090
 this is a gadget on RAM 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.900
 processor and hard disk for Russian 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.000
 all computer systems see that here 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.099
 such a very nice interface we 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.530
 First we check the compatible system 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:53.280
 if you have a very old map, then 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:58.250
 Maybe in the drivers will not be so we 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.250
 click here to see express 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:06.780
 and preparing to install guys I will say 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:09.360
 I want to pause because 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.629
 this can damage the installation and therefore 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.220
 I pause and so see the driver 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:17.190
 already booted also booted and 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:21.409
 nvidia geforce experience it what it 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:23.970
 letter and later we close it all and 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:24.959
 open in tehada who were 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.549
 installation 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:31.590
 for our yes our drivers here they are them 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.170
 you can safely remove them you specified 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.079
 the path to them you indicated the installation itself 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:40.019
 we remove them completely without leaving a trace 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:43.230
 manifests and let's see what is 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:45.150
 geforce experience discovering the world of stages 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.849
 As for me, useless program 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.590
 which we do not need, I constantly forget 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:51.269
 remove everything during installation 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.510
 uncheck it when installing 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:56.879
 drivers and therefore advise you to her 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.069
 generally install this program 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:00.530
 keeps track of all installed games 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.359
 click search games 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:07.019
 egor is not found unfortunately I do not know 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:09.359
 why I have here world of tanks 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.989
 which on earlier versions of this one 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:14.220
 applet 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:17.880
 was located from this program 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:21.239
 and principle we can see what we have 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.109
 drivers updated update them in 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.320
 driver tab 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:30.510
 here we can also see my system 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:33.930
 Cat what system in our 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:37.650
 what system is our everything here is written 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.210
 This model of video card memory how much 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.810
 memory we have prompt and expansion 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:45.210
 screen driver version which we have 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:47.760
 windows and much more and so 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.860
 games still could not find 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.680
 select the options let's remove we 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.260
 go to the control panel of the program 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.620
 programs and components and find and 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:00.990
 nvidia geforce expirience version well 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.150
 the newest which you will have 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.080
 updated 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:11.490
 we delete nvidia geforce expirience 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:13.980
 I donâ€™t want her at all 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:17.670
 tell you maybe you as gamers 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:20.670
 some will be comfortable and do not want to say 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:26.790
 what where gamers is some kind of mockery 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:28.680
 or I offend you all I deleted it not me 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.720
 need, in principle, all the program 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.970
 retired drivers updated go to 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:36.240
