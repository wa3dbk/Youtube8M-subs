we're<00:00:19.779> going<00:00:19.960> to<00:00:20.050> learn<00:00:20.259> how<00:00:20.320> to<00:00:20.590> use<00:00:20.980> the

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
we're going to learn how to use the

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.060 
we're going to learn how to use the
stitch<00:00:21.489> in<00:00:22.060> a<00:00:22.180> circular<00:00:22.480> and<00:00:22.930> a<00:00:23.169> flat<00:00:23.500> version

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070 
stitch in a circular and a flat version

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.350 
stitch in a circular and a flat version
and<00:00:24.369> you're<00:00:24.579> going<00:00:24.669> to<00:00:24.730> come<00:00:24.790> across<00:00:24.939> the

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:25.360 
and you're going to come across the

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.850 
and you're going to come across the
valley<00:00:25.570> and<00:00:25.840> you're<00:00:26.020> going<00:00:26.200> to<00:00:26.290> rotate<00:00:26.500> the

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:26.860 
valley and you're going to rotate the

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.959 
valley and you're going to rotate the
needle<00:00:27.160> and<00:00:27.369> come<00:00:27.880> up<00:00:28.059> from<00:00:28.300> bottom<00:00:28.840> to<00:00:28.869> top

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.939 

when<00:00:33.969> I<00:00:34.000> pull<00:00:34.329> this<00:00:34.510> you'll<00:00:35.410> see<00:00:35.649> that<00:00:35.829> it

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:35.949 
when I pull this you'll see that it

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:38.189 
when I pull this you'll see that it
actually<00:00:35.980> becomes<00:00:36.699> a<00:00:37.030> little<00:00:37.360> triangle<00:00:37.899> on

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:38.199 
actually becomes a little triangle on

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:43.500 
actually becomes a little triangle on
the<00:00:38.260> end<00:00:39.539> like<00:00:40.539> so<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:42.399> next<00:00:42.579> step<00:00:42.760> is<00:00:43.149> to

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
the end like so the next step is to

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.950 
the end like so the next step is to
reinforce<00:00:44.079> this<00:00:44.589> to<00:00:45.159> reinforce<00:00:45.760> you<00:00:46.690> need<00:00:46.870> to

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
reinforce this to reinforce you need to

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.789 
reinforce this to reinforce you need to
cross<00:00:47.230> over<00:00:47.469> and<00:00:47.769> come<00:00:48.549> back<00:00:49.000> up<00:00:49.059> a<00:00:49.589> bead<00:00:50.589> on

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:50.799 
cross over and come back up a bead on

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:52.649 
cross over and come back up a bead on
the<00:00:50.890> side<00:00:51.339> of<00:00:51.640> the<00:00:51.850> bead<00:00:52.030> you're<00:00:52.239> coming<00:00:52.510> out

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:52.659

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
that it's going to stay tight well we

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.900 
that it's going to stay tight well we
did<00:01:55.450> the<00:01:55.569> round<00:01:55.780> version<00:01:56.550> when<00:01:57.550> we<00:01:57.670> did<00:01:57.819> the

did the round version when we did the

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.609 
did the round version when we did the
first<00:01:57.940> row<00:01:58.330> kind<00:01:58.660> of<00:01:58.750> tightened<00:01:59.140> up<00:01:59.259> the<00:01:59.440> base

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
first row kind of tightened up the base

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.460 
first row kind of tightened up the base
row<00:01:59.920> so<00:02:00.729> I'm<00:02:00.789> going<00:02:01.060> down<00:02:01.269> through<00:02:01.690> the<00:02:02.050> second

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
row so I'm going down through the second

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.820 
row so I'm going down through the second
bead<00:02:03.420> here<00:02:04.420> are<00:02:04.569> some<00:02:04.750> samples<00:02:05.470> of<00:02:05.619> the

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
bead here are some samples of the

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.029 
bead here are some samples of the
