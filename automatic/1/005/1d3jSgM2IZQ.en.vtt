hey<00:00:01.740> guys<00:00:01.920> so<00:00:02.310> I<00:00:02.340> thought<00:00:02.610> I<00:00:02.639> would<00:00:02.760> do<00:00:02.970> a<00:00:03.000> video

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
hey guys so I thought I would do a video

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.610 
hey guys so I thought I would do a video
of<00:00:03.449> my<00:00:04.049> 100<00:00:04.680> squats<00:00:04.920> a<00:00:05.190> day<00:00:05.370> I<00:00:05.670> did<00:00:06.240> the<00:00:06.629> April

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
of my 100 squats a day I did the April

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.200 
of my 100 squats a day I did the April
challenge<00:00:08.069> for<00:00:08.309> a<00:00:08.340> hundred<00:00:08.639> squats<00:00:08.880> a<00:00:09.090> day

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
challenge for a hundred squats a day

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.900 
challenge for a hundred squats a day
where<00:00:09.570> every<00:00:10.019> day<00:00:10.170> in<00:00:10.320> April<00:00:10.769> I<00:00:11.040> did<00:00:11.219> 100

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
where every day in April I did 100

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.749 
where every day in April I did 100
squats<00:00:12.120> and<00:00:12.599> in<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.710> month<00:00:13.860> of<00:00:13.980> April<00:00:14.400> I<00:00:14.580> was

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
squats and in the month of April I was

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.900 
squats and in the month of April I was
actually<00:00:14.940> timing<00:00:15.540> myself<00:00:15.929> so<00:00:16.470> every<00:00:17.430> day<00:00:17.670> my

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
actually timing myself so every day my

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.359 
actually timing myself so every day my
goal<00:00:18.119> was<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.720> beat<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.500> time<00:00:19.740> of<00:00:20.039> the

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
goal was to beat the time of the

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.420 
goal was to beat the time of the
previous<00:00:20.789> day<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.289> I<00:00:22.289> think<00:00:22.350> my<00:00:22.830> very<00:00:22.890> first

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
previous day and I think my very first

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.009 
previous day and I think my very first
couple<00:00:23.730> days<00:00:23.880> which<00:00:24.359> was<00:00:24.480> actually<00:00:24.869> right

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
couple days which was actually right

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.630 
couple days which was actually right
before<00:00:25.199> April<00:00:25.650> started<00:00:26.010> because<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.250> wanted<00:00:26.550> to

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
before April started because I wanted to

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.269 
before April started because I wanted to
kind<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.330> ease<00:00:27.570> myself<00:00:27.779> into<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:29.070> very

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
kind of ease myself into it the very

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.220 
kind of ease myself into it the very
first<00:00:29.580> couple<00:00:29.939> days<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.269> did<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.779> was<00:00:30.900> taking

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
first couple days I did it it was taking

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.650 
first couple days I did it it was taking
me<00:00:31.349> like<00:00:31.529> 15<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.399> 20<00:00:32.669> minutes<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.090> do<00:00:33.270> 100

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
me like 15 to 20 minutes to do 100

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.170 
me like 15 to 20 minutes to do 100
squats<00:00:33.960> because<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:34.829> would<00:00:35.070> have<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.250> rest<00:00:35.969> in

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
squats because I would have to rest in

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.590 
squats because I would have to rest in
between<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:37.489> by<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.550> time<00:00:38.790> April<00:00:39.059> started<00:00:39.420> my

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
between and by the time April started my

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.420 
between and by the time April started my
time<00:00:39.809> was<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.020> little<00:00:40.170> over<00:00:40.590> five<00:00:40.770> minutes<00:00:41.010> and

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
time was a little over five minutes and

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.299 
time was a little over five minutes and
at<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.300> end<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.629> April<00:00:42.989> my<00:00:43.620> best<00:00:44.010> time<00:00:44.280> was

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
at the end of April my best time was

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.850 
at the end of April my best time was
right<00:00:45.120> around<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.899> 3-minute<00:00:46.379> mark<00:00:46.410> so

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
right around the 3-minute mark so

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.830 
right around the 3-minute mark so
sometimes<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.820> was<00:00:47.940> just<00:00:48.329> below<00:00:48.510> and

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
sometimes it was just below and

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.260 
sometimes it was just below and
sometimes<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.440> was<00:00:49.559> just<00:00:49.590> over<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:50.820> there<00:00:51.149> was

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
sometimes it was just over so there was

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.700 
sometimes it was just over so there was
definitely<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.690> lot<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:51.930> progress<00:00:52.110> when<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.590> do

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
definitely a lot of progress when you do

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.520 
definitely a lot of progress when you do
it<00:00:52.829> every<00:00:53.100> day<00:00:53.129> but<00:00:53.730> since<00:00:54.140> April<00:00:55.140> I've

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
it every day but since April I've

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.770 
it every day but since April I've
actually<00:00:55.829> kind<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.699> been<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.420> little<00:00:57.660> bit

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
actually kind of been a little bit

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.389 
actually kind of been a little bit
lazier<00:00:58.199> I've<00:00:58.410> only<00:00:58.559> done<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:59.010> few<00:00:59.219> times

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
lazier I've only done it a few times

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.099 
lazier I've only done it a few times
randomly<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.510> definitely<00:01:00.660> want<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:00.989> get

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
randomly and I definitely want to get

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.000 
randomly and I definitely want to get
back<00:01:01.289> into<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.829> so<00:01:03.049> if<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.229> look<00:01:04.379> at<00:01:04.500> my<00:01:04.619> form

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
back into it so if you look at my form

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.390 
back into it so if you look at my form
here<00:01:05.610> I'm<00:01:06.560> concentrating<00:01:07.560> on<00:01:07.799> making<00:01:08.369> sure

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
here I'm concentrating on making sure

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.270 
here I'm concentrating on making sure
that<00:01:08.549> my<00:01:08.880> knees<00:01:09.119> don't<00:01:09.750> go<00:01:09.900> inwards<00:01:10.680> when<00:01:11.130> I'm

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
that my knees don't go inwards when I'm

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.850 
that my knees don't go inwards when I'm
squatting<00:01:11.729> down<00:01:12.049> so<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.080> want<00:01:13.380> my<00:01:13.439> legs<00:01:13.710> to

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
squatting down so I want my legs to

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.570 
squatting down so I want my legs to
either<00:01:14.010> stay<00:01:14.450> parallel<00:01:15.450> or<00:01:15.720> slightly<00:01:16.580> open

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
either stay parallel or slightly open

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.539 
either stay parallel or slightly open
when<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.060> squat<00:01:18.450> down<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.110> I'm<00:01:19.799> raising<00:01:20.280> my

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
when I squat down and I'm raising my

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.700 
when I squat down and I'm raising my
arms<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:21.299> front<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.630> me<00:01:21.840> when<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.200> squat<00:01:22.530> down

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
arms in front of me when I squat down

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.700 
arms in front of me when I squat down
just<00:01:23.009> because<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.490> helps<00:01:23.820> with<00:01:24.000> my<00:01:24.030> balance

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
just because it helps with my balance

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.719 
just because it helps with my balance
you<00:01:25.710> can<00:01:25.830> actually<00:01:26.159> see<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.490> I'm<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.640> little

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
you can actually see that I'm a little

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:27.800 
you can actually see that I'm a little
bit<00:01:27.060> wobbly

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
bit wobbly

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.999 
bit wobbly
every<00:01:28.020> now<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.259> again<00:01:28.290> when<00:01:28.530> I'm<00:01:28.650> coming<00:01:28.799> up

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
every now and again when I'm coming up

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.830 
every now and again when I'm coming up
and<00:01:29.280> that's<00:01:29.430> because<00:01:29.700> one<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.390> my<00:01:30.450> legs<00:01:30.630> is

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
and that's because one of my legs is

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.109 
and that's because one of my legs is
stronger<00:01:31.259> than<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.500> other<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:32.430> I'm<00:01:32.790> kind<00:01:33.060> of

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
stronger than the other so I'm kind of

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.390 
stronger than the other so I'm kind of
compensating<00:01:33.720> with<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.259> leg<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:34.950> it's

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
compensating with that leg so it's

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.370 
compensating with that leg so it's
really<00:01:35.610> nice<00:01:35.790> actually<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.329> film<00:01:37.200> yourself

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
really nice actually to film yourself

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.380 
really nice actually to film yourself
and<00:01:37.799> look<00:01:37.890> back<00:01:38.040> on<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:38.400> because<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:38.970> never

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
and look back on this because I never

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.830 
and look back on this because I never
noticed<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.869> before<00:01:39.930> even<00:01:40.860> though<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.720> you<00:01:42.720> know

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
noticed it before even though I you know

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.060 
noticed it before even though I you know
I've<00:01:43.049> done<00:01:43.259> them<00:01:43.409> in<00:01:43.530> front<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.829> mirror

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
I've done them in front of the mirror

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.670 
I've done them in front of the mirror
and<00:01:44.509> it's<00:01:45.509> just<00:01:45.750> it's<00:01:46.110> not<00:01:46.259> something<00:01:46.590> you

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
and it's just it's not something you

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.050 
and it's just it's not something you

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.330 
that's just another thing you really
want<00:02:33.320> to<00:02:33.410> be<00:02:33.470> conscious<00:02:33.860> of<00:02:33.980> when<00:02:34.220> you're

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
want to be conscious of when you're

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.930 
want to be conscious of when you're
doing<00:02:34.370> this<00:02:34.820> and<00:02:35.860> I'm<00:02:36.860> doing<00:02:36.920> it<00:02:37.460> a<00:02:37.550> little<00:02:37.790> bit

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
doing this and I'm doing it a little bit

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.490 
doing this and I'm doing it a little bit
slower<00:02:38.210> now<00:02:38.450> than<00:02:38.690> I<00:02:38.750> used<00:02:38.990> to<00:02:39.140> I<00:02:39.230> actually

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
slower now than I used to I actually

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.440 
slower now than I used to I actually
prefer<00:02:40.250> going<00:02:40.490> a<00:02:40.670> little<00:02:40.760> bit<00:02:40.970> slower<00:02:41.240> and

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
prefer going a little bit slower and

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.030 
prefer going a little bit slower and
really<00:02:41.720> being<00:02:41.930> able<00:02:42.050> to<00:02:42.200> concentrate<00:02:42.470> on<00:02:42.920> my

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
really being able to concentrate on my

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.160 
really being able to concentrate on my
form<00:02:43.340> when<00:02:43.580> I<00:02:43.610> was<00:02:43.850> doing<00:02:44.000> it<00:02:44.240> for<00:02:44.270> speed

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
form when I was doing it for speed

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.870 
form when I was doing it for speed
I<00:02:45.230> kind<00:02:45.800> of<00:02:45.890> was<00:02:46.040> getting<00:02:46.310> a<00:02:46.400> little<00:02:46.790> bit

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
I kind of was getting a little bit

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.670 
I kind of was getting a little bit
sloppier<00:02:47.360> I<00:02:47.660> was<00:02:47.840> still<00:02:48.020> paying<00:02:48.230> attention<00:02:48.590> to

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
sloppier I was still paying attention to

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.350 
sloppier I was still paying attention to
form<00:02:48.950> but<00:02:49.280> it's<00:02:49.490> a<00:02:49.580> lot<00:02:49.760> harder<00:02:49.970> when<00:02:50.240> you're

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
form but it's a lot harder when you're

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.680 
form but it's a lot harder when you're
trying<00:02:50.510> to<00:02:50.660> do<00:02:50.750> it<00:02:50.870> faster<00:02:52.150> okay<00:02:53.150> so<00:02:53.210> I<00:02:53.360> thought

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
trying to do it faster okay so I thought

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.840 
trying to do it faster okay so I thought
I<00:02:53.840> would<00:02:54.050> cut<00:02:54.290> in<00:02:54.560> a<00:02:54.860> better<00:02:55.160> angle<00:02:55.610> so<00:02:55.820> you

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
I would cut in a better angle so you

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.270 
I would cut in a better angle so you
could<00:02:56.090> see<00:02:56.330> my<00:02:56.480> feet<00:02:56.840> and<00:02:57.110> here<00:02:57.920> you<00:02:58.010> can<00:02:58.100> see

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
could see my feet and here you can see

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.800 
could see my feet and here you can see
that<00:02:58.430> my<00:02:58.490> knees<00:02:58.670> are<00:02:58.700> staying<00:02:59.180> behind<00:02:59.420> my<00:02:59.630> feet

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
that my knees are staying behind my feet

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.350 
that my knees are staying behind my feet
when<00:03:00.020> I'm<00:03:00.140> going<00:03:00.410> down<00:03:00.650> and<00:03:00.980> that<00:03:01.730> I'm<00:03:01.910> keeping

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
when I'm going down and that I'm keeping

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.510 
when I'm going down and that I'm keeping
my<00:03:02.450> legs<00:03:02.690> wide<00:03:03.200> when<00:03:03.500> I<00:03:03.530> go<00:03:03.740> down<00:03:03.980> instead<00:03:04.370> of

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
my legs wide when I go down instead of

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.060 
my legs wide when I go down instead of
letting<00:03:04.790> them<00:03:04.910> come<00:03:05.090> towards<00:03:05.540> each<00:03:05.720> other<00:03:06.070> you

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
letting them come towards each other you

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.200 
letting them come towards each other you
can<00:03:07.160> actually<00:03:07.310> see<00:03:07.640> that<00:03:07.760> I<00:03:07.820> do<00:03:07.910> have<00:03:08.180> a

I<00:03:15.710> just<00:03:15.830> wanted<00:03:16.280> to<00:03:16.400> show<00:03:16.610> you<00:03:16.640> that<00:03:17.270> I<00:03:17.540> always

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
I just wanted to show you that I always

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.840 
I just wanted to show you that I always
do<00:03:18.320> my<00:03:18.350> squats<00:03:18.650> in<00:03:18.920> front<00:03:19.160> of<00:03:19.220> the<00:03:19.280> mirror<00:03:19.550> it

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
do my squats in front of the mirror it

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.460 
do my squats in front of the mirror it
makes<00:03:20.150> a<00:03:20.360> really<00:03:20.570> big<00:03:20.750> difference<00:03:20.810> for<00:03:21.350> me

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
makes a really big difference for me

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.080 
makes a really big difference for me
because<00:03:21.800> if<00:03:22.040> I'm<00:03:22.160> not<00:03:22.310> doing<00:03:22.550> them<00:03:22.790> in<00:03:22.940> front

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
because if I'm not doing them in front

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.440 
because if I'm not doing them in front
of<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:23.239> mirror<00:03:23.510> my<00:03:24.140> form<00:03:24.650> gets<00:03:25.160> really<00:03:25.970> sloppy

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
of the mirror my form gets really sloppy

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.930 
of the mirror my form gets really sloppy
it's<00:03:27.140> really<00:03:27.410> easy<00:03:27.650> for<00:03:27.920> me<00:03:27.980> to<00:03:28.130> get<00:03:28.520> lost<00:03:28.730> in

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
it's really easy for me to get lost in

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.030 
it's really easy for me to get lost in
my<00:03:29.090> head<00:03:29.300> and<00:03:29.630> just<00:03:29.840> get<00:03:29.989> distracted<00:03:30.350> and<00:03:30.920> I

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
my head and just get distracted and I

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.710 
my head and just get distracted and I
start<00:03:31.250> thinking<00:03:31.310> about<00:03:31.610> other<00:03:31.910> things<00:03:32.000> or<00:03:32.630> I'm

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
start thinking about other things or I'm

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.330 
start thinking about other things or I'm
thinking<00:03:32.870> about<00:03:33.290> wanting<00:03:33.500> the<00:03:33.770> squats<00:03:34.040> to<00:03:34.250> be

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
thinking about wanting the squats to be

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.699 
thinking about wanting the squats to be
over<00:03:34.670> already<00:03:34.820> and<00:03:35.300> the<00:03:36.140> last<00:03:36.350> thing<00:03:36.560> on<00:03:36.680> my

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
over already and the last thing on my

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.910 
over already and the last thing on my
mind<00:03:36.830> is<00:03:37.310> form<00:03:37.880> so<00:03:38.660> I<00:03:38.690> really<00:03:39.230> recommend<00:03:39.350> doing

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
mind is form so I really recommend doing

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.199
