only people that use Celsius it goes up

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.270 
only people that use Celsius it goes up
to<00:00:56.940> 410<00:00:57.930> Fahrenheit<00:00:58.530> that's<00:00:58.770> really<00:00:59.100> really

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
to 410 Fahrenheit that's really really

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.970 
to 410 Fahrenheit that's really really
hot<00:00:59.690> and<00:01:00.690> it's<00:01:00.989> got<00:01:01.109> precise<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.680> stable

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.549 
hot and it's got precise and stable
temperature<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:03.030> has<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.180> swivel<00:01:03.539> cord<00:01:04.080> so

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
temperature and it has a swivel cord so

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.840 
temperature and it has a swivel cord so
that<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.799> doesn't<00:01:04.949> get<00:01:05.100> all<00:01:05.220> tangled<00:01:05.519> up<00:01:05.670> and

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
that it doesn't get all tangled up and

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.240 
that it doesn't get all tangled up and
it's<00:01:06.510> ergonomically<00:01:07.080> designed<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.979> is

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
it's ergonomically designed this is

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.090 
it's ergonomically designed this is
basically<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:09.170> great<00:01:10.170> straightener<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:10.979> is

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
basically a great straightener this is

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.550 
basically a great straightener this is
recommended<00:01:11.369> for<00:01:11.700> those<00:01:11.909> with<00:01:12.350> super<00:01:13.350> curly

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
recommended for those with super curly

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.620 
recommended for those with super curly
and<00:01:13.770> thick<00:01:14.010> hair<00:01:14.220> because<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.119> dawn<00:01:15.360> of

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
and thick hair because is the dawn of

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.910 
and thick hair because is the dawn of
strainers<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.320> can<00:01:16.470> curl<00:01:16.619> with<00:01:16.770> those

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
strainers and you can curl with those

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.440 
strainers and you can curl with those
two<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.369> can't<00:01:17.580> go<00:01:17.700> with<00:01:17.850> those<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.090> can<00:01:18.240> flip

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
two you can't go with those you can flip

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.390 
two you can't go with those you can flip
you<00:01:18.600> can<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:19.500> know<00:01:19.619> do<00:01:19.860> everything<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.369> want

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
you can you know do everything you want

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.120 
you can you know do everything you want
to<00:01:20.610> do<00:01:20.729> with<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.939> strainer<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.450> can<00:01:21.570> stream

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
to do with the strainer you can stream

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.950

that<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:07.050> um<00:02:07.520> these<00:02:08.520> were<00:02:08.700> ceramic

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
that that um these were ceramic

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.500 
that that um these were ceramic
tourmaline<00:02:09.390> both<00:02:09.840> of<00:02:09.960> these<00:02:10.080> are<00:02:10.430> and<00:02:11.430> what<00:02:12.360> is

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
tourmaline both of these are and what is

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.030 
tourmaline both of these are and what is
so<00:02:12.660> that's<00:02:12.870> right<00:02:13.230> I<00:02:13.410> can't<00:02:13.650> leave<00:02:13.710> is<00:02:13.830> late

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
so that's right I can't leave is late

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.670 
so that's right I can't leave is late
for<00:02:14.160> Alec<00:02:14.640> you<00:02:15.030> see<00:02:15.270> it's<00:02:15.570> infused<00:02:16.020> gemstones

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
for Alec you see it's infused gemstones

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.560 
for Alec you see it's infused gemstones
so<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.130> gives<00:02:17.280> it<00:02:17.460> kind<00:02:17.700> of<00:02:17.820> better<00:02:18.060> properties

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
so it gives it kind of better properties

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.020 
so it gives it kind of better properties
for<00:02:18.810> like<00:02:19.140> mingling<00:02:19.830> train<00:02:20.130> on<00:02:20.400> smell<00:02:20.820> and

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
for like mingling train on smell and

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.850 
for like mingling train on smell and
keeping<00:02:21.330> moisture<00:02:21.480> in<00:02:21.810> hair<00:02:22.050> and<00:02:22.080> whatnot<00:02:22.680> so

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
keeping moisture in hair and whatnot so

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.700 
keeping moisture in hair and whatnot so
um<00:02:23.670> yeah<00:02:24.360> that's<00:02:24.570> what<00:02:24.720> they<00:02:24.810> look<00:02:24.960> like<00:02:24.990> so

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
um yeah that's what they look like so

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.440 
um yeah that's what they look like so
the<00:02:25.890> reason<00:02:26.070> if<00:02:26.760> you're<00:02:26.970> in<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.150> rest<00:02:27.330> of<00:02:27.390> the

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
because the u.s. voltage so we don't

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.040

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
u.s. you can win these but if you're not

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.430 
u.s. you can win these but if you're not
and<00:02:36.330> you<00:02:36.390> still<00:02:36.600> want<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:36.780> win<00:02:36.870> try<00:02:37.110> those<00:02:37.260> was
