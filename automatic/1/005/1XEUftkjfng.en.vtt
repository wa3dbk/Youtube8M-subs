 Hi everyone guys are on the way 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:20.220
 today I want to show you how to find 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:28.640
 the distant lands and light minecraft 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:28.640
 Christmas is a place where the game 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:38.840
 at least a large but they say that wide and 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.840
 the map all twisted and very strange 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.629
 prove it 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:50.250
 now I will explain to you how to get there without it 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:53.250
 we'll use tricks to get there because 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:58.620
 otherwise it is impossible is impossible 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.620
 you have to play you bring nine hundred between 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.449
 the stuff like that so we'll use the tools 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.100
 I advise you to stay creative because 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.270
 otherwise don't survive if you do 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:13.820
 I say since then we do this command 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:24.570
 slash all types then we write 2 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:26.310
 with 79 lupar left we press with the 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.600
 first we test with seven then 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.600
 because I don't remember mouthpiece 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.820
 wrong even though I got it wrong 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.009
 mistaken 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:47.280
 here then we have to write percent and 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:47.939
 zero ok it's too much is too big 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.929
 distance 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.929
 then we have to take away with 9 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:53.929
 fantastic 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.980
 little music 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:12.920
 at the end of the minecraft world a 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.100
 boy see you here and darker e 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.890
 this is normal 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:21.850
 I tell you in the end you see there is one 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.850
 she deserves it 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:33.430
 Get ready cost in creative sprints 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:33.430
 look there is not 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.159
 there is not 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:48.700
 these blocks are soil and own 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:48.700
 good sweet water nothing 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:57.130
 It is something that I like very much 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.170
 look at me the minimum reiss ton 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:04.570
 through you know there is just one 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:10.330
 split and these blocks of this 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:15.760
 soil species are not blocks in 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:17.230
 actually these blocks are not there is for 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.000
 this I said to be creative 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.770
 meaning adults there are no tell me you 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:29.070
 here is the psi I see found in the above ri 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:34.980
 Inter has passed under the world 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:34.980
 before seeing it pissed off 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.440
 small demonstration 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.250
 the blocks and blocks does not exist 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.170
 view 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.860
