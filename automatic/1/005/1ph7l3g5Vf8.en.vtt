in a long time the chicken of course is
the<00:02:18.400> KFC<00:02:18.730> chicken<00:02:19.590> but<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:21.370> only<00:02:21.520> problem<00:02:21.790> I

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
the KFC chicken but the only problem I

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.840 
the KFC chicken but the only problem I
have<00:02:22.000> with<00:02:22.090> the<00:02:22.180> sandwich<00:02:22.450> is<00:02:22.570> very<00:02:22.780> dry<00:02:23.850> after

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
eating it is a big piece of chicken so I

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.290 
eating it is a big piece of chicken so I
think<00:02:29.050> I'm<00:02:29.260> gonna<00:02:29.470> get<00:02:29.620> full<00:02:30.060> rights<00:02:31.060> but<00:02:31.240> I

think I'm gonna get full rights but I

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.910 
think I'm gonna get full rights but I
think<00:02:31.660> this<00:02:31.750> this<00:02:32.230> thing's<00:02:32.410> probably<00:02:32.530> better

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
think this this thing's probably better

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.510 
think this this thing's probably better
