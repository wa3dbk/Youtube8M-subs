00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
so when I saw Four Thirds in the package

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.470 
so when I saw Four Thirds in the package
I<00:00:22.380> was<00:00:22.500> just<00:00:22.769> sort<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:22.980> under<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.160> impression

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
I was just sort of under the impression

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.700 
I was just sort of under the impression
its<00:00:24.480> Micro<00:00:24.810> Four<00:00:24.990> Thirds<00:00:25.019> like<00:00:25.439> it's

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
its Micro Four Thirds like it's

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.380 
its Micro Four Thirds like it's
extremely<00:00:26.430> common<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:27.029> they<00:00:27.119> were<00:00:27.180> showing

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
extremely common and they were showing

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.750
