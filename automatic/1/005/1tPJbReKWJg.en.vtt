00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.060 
of coconut oil spray cuz I figured I'll

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.310 
of coconut oil spray cuz I figured I'll
try<00:00:22.300> it<00:00:22.449> out<00:00:22.630> like<00:00:23.230> that<00:00:24.539> I've<00:00:25.539> been<00:00:25.720> using<00:00:25.990> it

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
try it out like that I've been using it

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.730
