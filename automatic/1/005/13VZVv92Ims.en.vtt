00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
concept but very very fun you could kind

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.530 
concept but very very fun you could kind
of<00:01:03.370> half<00:01:03.550> class<00:01:03.820> it<00:01:04.000> as<00:01:04.059> a<00:01:04.119> puzzle<00:01:04.509> game

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
of half class it as a puzzle game

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.999 
of half class it as a puzzle game
actually<00:01:04.839> just<00:01:05.229> be<00:01:05.350> very<00:01:05.530> careful<00:01:05.650> about

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.009 
actually just be very careful about

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:07.950 
actually just be very careful about
where<00:01:06.250> you<00:01:06.340> place<00:01:06.549> your<00:01:06.670> infection<00:01:07.210> and<00:01:07.420> where

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
where you place your infection and where

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.389 
where you place your infection and where
you<00:01:08.049> place<00:01:08.259> your<00:01:08.380> zombie<00:01:08.649> spawns<00:01:08.920> and<00:01:09.130> whatnot

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:09.399 
you place your zombie spawns and whatnot

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:10.770 
you place your zombie spawns and whatnot
but<00:01:09.729> eventually<00:01:09.970> it<00:01:10.210> will<00:01:10.299> get<00:01:10.420> to<00:01:10.479> the<00:01:10.630> point

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
but eventually it will get to the point

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.780 
but eventually it will get to the point
where<00:01:11.049> you<00:01:11.140> are<00:01:11.170> so<00:01:11.439> powerful<00:01:11.740> and<00:01:12.340> it<00:01:12.430> really

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
where you are so powerful and it really

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.780 
where you are so powerful and it really
really<00:01:13.090> doesn't<00:01:13.750> matter<00:01:13.979> but<00:01:14.979> yes<00:01:15.220> the<00:01:15.490> areas

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
really doesn't matter but yes the areas

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.340 
really doesn't matter but yes the areas
do<00:01:15.909> actually<00:01:16.240> expand<00:01:16.570> for<00:01:16.900> part<00:01:17.140> way<00:01:17.200> through

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
do actually expand for part way through

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.899 
do actually expand for part way through
the<00:01:17.440> game<00:01:17.470> you'll<00:01:17.680> get<00:01:18.010> more<00:01:18.580> and<00:01:18.700> more<00:01:18.790> people

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
the game you'll get more and more people

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:20.850 
the game you'll get more and more people
in<00:01:19.120> each<00:01:19.210> area<00:01:19.360> so<00:01:19.630> more<00:01:19.930> and<00:01:20.050> more<00:01:20.140> expensive

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
in each area so more and more expensive

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.920 
in each area so more and more expensive
maps<00:01:21.370> so<00:01:22.000> it<00:01:22.120> gets<00:01:22.210> harder<00:01:22.570> and<00:01:22.630> harder<00:01:22.690> to

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
maps so it gets harder and harder to

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.660 
maps so it gets harder and harder to
kill<00:01:23.080> everybody<00:01:23.320> so<00:01:23.560> I<00:01:23.590> suppose<00:01:23.890> but<00:01:24.280> remain<00:01:24.640> a

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
kill everybody so I suppose but remain a

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.700 
kill everybody so I suppose but remain a
puzzle<00:01:25.090> tribe<00:01:25.330> hoping<00:01:25.780> but<00:01:26.260> yeah<00:01:26.409> go<00:01:26.590> ahead

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
puzzle tribe hoping but yeah go ahead

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.230 
puzzle tribe hoping but yeah go ahead
and<00:01:26.799> give<00:01:26.979> it<00:01:27.010> a<00:01:27.100> go<00:01:27.220> it's<00:01:27.430> free<00:01:27.700> to<00:01:27.820> play<00:01:27.909> so

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
and give it a go it's free to play so

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.260 
and give it a go it's free to play so

again for the lateness of the episodes

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.580 
again for the lateness of the episodes
they've<00:03:43.180> been<00:03:43.299> coming<00:03:43.450> out<00:03:43.660> at<00:03:43.900> a<00:03:44.079> ridiculous

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
they've been coming out at a ridiculous

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.360

time<00:03:44.620> generally<00:03:45.340> around<00:03:45.430> 11<00:03:46.239> 1130<00:03:46.769> GMT<00:03:47.769> sits

time generally around 11 1130 GMT sits

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.520 
time generally around 11 1130 GMT sits
pretty<00:03:49.090> much<00:03:49.299> unacceptable<00:03:49.959> and<00:03:50.079> I<00:03:50.140> know<00:03:50.200> that

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
pretty much unacceptable and I know that

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.710 
pretty much unacceptable and I know that
but<00:03:50.650> the<00:03:51.220> reasoning<00:03:51.610> behind<00:03:51.640> it<00:03:52.060> is<00:03:52.209> purely

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
but the reasoning behind it is purely

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.620 
but the reasoning behind it is purely
because<00:03:52.959> it<00:03:53.829> takes<00:03:54.010> so<00:03:54.160> long<00:03:54.400> to<00:03:54.459> make<00:03:54.790> and

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
because it takes so long to make and

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.770 
because it takes so long to make and
I've<00:03:55.750> got<00:03:55.930> so<00:03:56.140> much<00:03:56.260> schoolwork<00:03:56.530> to<00:03:56.799> do<00:03:56.950> so

I've got so much schoolwork to do so

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.740 
I've got so much schoolwork to do so
it's<00:03:58.780> really<00:03:59.170> difficult<00:03:59.500> for<00:03:59.860> me<00:03:59.980> I<00:04:00.970> am<00:04:01.570> just
