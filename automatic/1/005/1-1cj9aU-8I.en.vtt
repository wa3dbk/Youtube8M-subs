00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 the damn nerds need to be 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.770
 informed by that now maximum brings you 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.620
 all the news from the world of 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.620
 technology and videogames 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.389
 keep the intruders in val a group 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.130
 of gifted players who performed 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.080
 a visit to the val office 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.490
 they posted an image in which you see the 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.350
 registration of projects of the 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.240
 creators leave live and between them they 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.449
 He finds the rumored one but has never 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.490
 announced les for dirt 3 in this list 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.529
 whose veracity remains to be verified 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.780
 the new one is also mentioned 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.579
 graphic engine source 2 that is 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.290
 officially in development since a 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.600
 obviously it is to be assumed that 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.670
 titles like left order 3 will take advantage 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.860
 this new technology as he said clear 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.059
 than the level a few months ago now if 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.379
 these players take advantage of our 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.239
 essence remains to be seen a class of 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.039
 engineering the image of the hacker in the 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.989
 cinema and TV have little to do with 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.879
 reality on the small screen we see 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.890
 bald carlin typing the crazy zeros and 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.660
 some on a screen plugging in a heat 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.430
 and flying in buildings while in 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.140
 the reality the most dangerous hackers 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.890
 are the ones that do not need a keyboard to 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.900
 Steal 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.970
 action to code the key of a bank 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.250
 it's very difficult but getting some 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.500
 clueless I give you your key is a lot but 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.990
 much easier hackers are called to 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.090
 these social engineering procedures and 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.830
 an ex hacker who has it clear gave 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.590
 Chair on the subject 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.590
 jordan harbinger today gives seminar about 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.720
 posta how to rise mines in bars and 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.310
 He said that after all they are the same 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.560
 manipulation skills 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.180
 harbinger met some employees of the 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.740
 defense department wanted 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.780
 impress those and told him details 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.229
 superficial but secret with these 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.149
 data 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.340
 jordan found a group of linkedin 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.020
 for specialists in the subject and sent 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.550
 mails offering work in a company 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.140
 of intelligence getting the guys 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.539
 tell you what they were working on 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.280
 moment taking out super secret data 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.500
 harbinger showed how easy it is to do 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.600
 shake the cia in a talk at the 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.220
 conference defcon maybe tomorrow what 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.789
 they find in a ditch but that gave 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.380
 radio chair to someone the nintendo is 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:02.880
 he started making numbers and he came to the 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.649
 conclusion that the company that 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.970
 hosts the brothers mario to everything 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:11.280
 jairo and other worlds sold since 1983 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:14.130
 268 97 million consoles and 300 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.680
 85 15 million laptops not only that 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.530
 but they sold 4 000 102 million 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.110
 games all this adds about 80 and 15 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:26.069
 billions of yen or as iwata sees it a 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:29.310
 come back with russia do not fuck crazy juan si 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.830
 You are the European company distributor 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.720
 hero 2 game that includes tactics of 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.340
 dynamic battle and destruction of 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.739
 environments based on historical facts 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.090
 of real conflicts announced that he will leave 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.100
 of distributing the game due to 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.020
 numerous criticisms that he himself received 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.820
 on the part of the Russian players who 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.950
 consider that the new work of relic 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.350
 entertainment is full of myths and 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.300
 Western prejudices about 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.310
 participation of the Soviet Union in 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.590
 the second world war for its part 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.970
 he was promised to investigate the matter but 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.069
 still did not transcend any kind of 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.760
 modification or communicated about it and 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:05.489
 much less an apology windows is the 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.050
 play those who use smartphones a while ago 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.000
 they know that the decision of a system 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.130
 operative or another has nothing to do with your 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.810
 power nor with the quality of its design 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.700
 but with the amount of applications 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.890
 available apple took a little bit of 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.610
 advantage to android blackberry stayed 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.980
 asleep 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.420
 the popular windows phone 8 although it comes 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.280
 with several first-line phones 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.990
 has in comparison very few 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.540
 applications the answer of microsoft 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.280
 is admirable and seems to be against 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.140
 the fame that the company has this week 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.170
 they launched a program called windows 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.060
 phone app studio completely free 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.130
 that will allow to develop applications to 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.890
 anyone who has knowledge 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.630
 minimum of html5 of course the 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.030
 applications are not very powerful but 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.770
 Microsoft relies on flexibility and 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.600
 user creativity what 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:52.020
 enough to not charge a 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.240
 penny for the thieves system but 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.100
 punctual overkill software surprised 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.930
 a pretty anxious public this week 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.720
 when using your twitter account 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.510
 announced that pay 2 will anticipate some 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.480
 days and would arrive on August 13 to pc and 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.400
 between August 13 and 16 to consoles 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.380
 the game that was expected by the end of 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.570
 August generated a lot of 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.880
 adepts with their first delivery and this is not 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.799
 plan to stay behind so be prepared 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.570
 because next Tuesday they will be able to 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.420
 relive the times of playing pool and 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.790
 thief but in the best possible way 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.190
 and hit him with the guitar and ubisoft 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.500
 confirmed that the 2014 edition of his 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.030
 Rocks meet guitar simulator will count 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.340
 with improved lessons to master 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.870
 our instrument the game will include a 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.670
 new system that will recognize 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.220
 automatically our mistakes we 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:40.200
 will give a detailed explanation of what 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.820
 that we fail and even the keys that 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.160
 we should practice so that we 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.720
 we repeat in addition and ubisoft promises that 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.240
 the classes of the new rocksmith will be 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.980
 much much more dynamic and flexible 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.920
 being more accessible to 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.270
 beginners looking to start from scratch 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.980
 really from scratch so he dusted in 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.000
 your guitars and tune the strings 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:01.530
 because in October 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.990
 rocksmith 2014 will be among us already 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.270
 that I loved the throne last year I told you 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:09.060
 that in Japan when we had created the 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.190
 first intelligent toilet the satish of 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.630
 the line hain acz that sounds like a 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.070
 extraterrestrial that comes to invade the 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.900
 land but it's just a piece of 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.340
 porcelain connected to the sewer that is 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.530
 able to do a couple of being sometimes 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.420
 how to know by bluetooth that goes into 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.980
 your house and start heating the lid 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.780
 so that you do not get cold in the houses 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.760
 the satish does all this through a 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.409
 application that runs nando and hyun kim 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.869
 Japan was a moderate success 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:33.209
 of security back I'll realized 

00:05:30.869 --> 00:05:35.009
 a small error in the application though 

00:05:33.209 --> 00:05:36.719
 the program asks for your serial number 

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:38.969
 does not save it and then all 

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:40.979
 neighboring satish toilets react to the 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:42.599
 application then for example you can 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:44.519
 go to the path of someone who does not have and 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:46.589
 from the corner activate puts l the 

00:05:44.519 --> 00:05:49.679
 stream of the video at maximum speed and 

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:51.509
 very high temperature nl of course the 

00:05:49.679 --> 00:05:54.529
 company does not admit errors or return the 

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:58.110
 money for playing your used gold wine 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:06:00.509
 failed but used the same but 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.069
 different yet I do not know if they are good or 

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:04.139
 bad news for hunters and 

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:05.939
 achievements but microsoft announced that the 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:08.699
 games that are both in xbox 

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:10.979
 360 as a nexus act they will have different 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:12.929
 achievements or achievements in this way if 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:15.059
 we play with the beauty goes in our 

00:06:12.929 --> 00:06:16.949
 360 we will not work them the same 

00:06:15.059 --> 00:06:19.199
 achievements that we would obtain and play in 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:20.879
 software and the latter some achievements 

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:22.949
 could become different 

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:25.619
 Rewards to redeem value of replayability 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:28.399
 or marketing strategy 21 

00:06:25.619 --> 00:06:30.689
 November we tell you more data in 

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:32.879
 www.cgae.es that on Tuesdays and Wednesdays at 

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:35.280
 the 23 on damn nerds here in

 vorterix road in connection with goal 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:41.100
 dotcom the misfits will inherit the 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.740
 land and for that they need to be 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:47.660
 informed 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:47.660
 damn cars in fort the ex not
