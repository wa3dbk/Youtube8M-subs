using AI file of course which is the
jailbreak<00:02:05.429> version<00:02:05.819> but<00:02:06.660> anyway<00:02:07.319> so<00:02:07.830> you

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
jailbreak version but anyway so you

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.990 
jailbreak version but anyway so you
don't<00:02:08.069> need<00:02:08.160> jailbreak<00:02:08.550> though<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.789> can<00:02:08.910> do

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
don't need jailbreak though you can do

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.360 
don't need jailbreak though you can do
this<00:02:09.149> with<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.330> PC<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:09.810> just<00:02:10.080> takes<00:02:10.259> longer<00:02:10.440> by

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
this with a PC it just takes longer by

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.890 
this with a PC it just takes longer by
using<00:02:11.520> I<00:02:11.730> Explorer<00:02:12.090> or<00:02:12.360> something<00:02:12.660> but<00:02:12.780> then

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.620 
level of that make sure to put that in
another<00:02:53.860> folder<00:02:54.310> before<00:02:54.580> you<00:02:54.970> paste<00:02:55.209> it<00:02:55.390> in<00:02:55.480> if

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
another folder before you paste it in if

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:56.699 
another folder before you paste it in if
that<00:02:55.720> makes<00:02:55.900> sense<00:02:56.079> so<00:02:56.200> you<00:02:56.290> want<00:02:56.440> to<00:02:56.500> copy

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
like I can't actually fly and if I jump

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.319 
like I can't actually fly and if I jump
off<00:03:52.599> here<00:03:52.660> I<00:03:53.169> actually<00:03:53.650> take<00:03:53.919> fall<00:03:54.160> damage<00:03:54.329> you

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
off here I actually take fall damage you

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:56.789 
off here I actually take fall damage you
can't<00:03:55.569> see<00:03:55.810> it<00:03:55.900> but<00:03:56.049> the<00:03:56.169> world<00:03:56.319> it<00:03:56.620> still

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
can't see it but the world it still

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:58.080 
can't see it but the world it still
thinks<00:03:56.950> you're<00:03:57.130> in<00:03:57.220> survival<00:03:57.430> but<00:03:57.760> you<00:03:57.849> get<00:03:58.000> to

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
thinks you're in survival but you get to

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.360 
thinks you're in survival but you get to
creative<00:03:58.450> inventory<00:03:58.660> and<00:03:58.989> everything<00:03:59.370> it's

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
creative inventory and everything it's

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:01.589 
creative inventory and everything it's
pretty<00:04:00.549> cool<00:04:00.700> though

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
pretty cool though

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:03.690 
pretty cool though
and<00:04:01.780> I<00:04:02.260> am<00:04:02.829> it's<00:04:03.310> a<00:04:03.340> little<00:04:03.489> bit<00:04:03.579> different

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
and I am it's a little bit different

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.099 
and I am it's a little bit different
than<00:04:03.910> it<00:04:04.000> was<00:04:04.090> before<00:04:04.150> for<00:04:04.540> changing<00:04:05.079> your

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
than it was before for changing your

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:08.250 
than it was before for changing your
worlds<00:04:05.560> but<00:04:06.090> now<00:04:07.090> you<00:04:07.150> just<00:04:07.630> copy<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:08.049> level

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
worlds but now you just copy the level

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.659 
worlds but now you just copy the level
at<00:04:08.349> that<00:04:08.500> before<00:04:08.919> you<00:04:09.040> had<00:04:09.160> to<00:04:09.190> copy<00:04:09.459> some

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:09.669 
at that before you had to copy some

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:11.729 
at that before you had to copy some
other<00:04:09.819> stuff<00:04:10.090> and<00:04:10.329> the<00:04:11.049> world<00:04:11.290> files<00:04:11.560> look

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
other stuff and the world files look

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.970 
other stuff and the world files look
different<00:04:12.040> now<00:04:12.130> and<00:04:12.370> yeah<00:04:13.269> anyway<00:04:14.079> so<00:04:14.650> I<00:04:14.680> hope

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
different now and yeah anyway so I hope

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.250 
different now and yeah anyway so I hope
