 Hello my life, welcome to 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.940

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.339
 Today I want for 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.379
 I mean super delicious and above all 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.279
 things superfast apple carrots salad 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.800

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.710
 today there is always with her when I go to 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.619
 Lunch something fresh something 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.360
 would like to make a delicious salad and about 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.480
 I usually have at home and just 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:33.300
 listen to and that's why if you relish the 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.390
 rover just look at it first 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:41.129
 you need to have 300 grams peeled 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:44.070
 and cut in pieces and I have 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.359
 two apples well gutted and gutted 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.359
 also cut into pieces 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.499
 now our ingredients can be added soon 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:58.429
 for the salad sauce to do it 

00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:58.429
 That would be ten grams 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.810
 10 grams of balsamic vinegar 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.770
 because a pinch of salt is salt 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:33.130
 and a pinch of pepper so come now 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:36.350
 sugar in addition I take most 43 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.060
 supports ions that's a tablespoon 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.670
 sugar 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.960
 he comes to it if you like and 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.460

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.400
 also like a few more nuts 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.920

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.710

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.720

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.720
