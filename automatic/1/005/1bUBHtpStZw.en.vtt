standard macbook pro the glass plate on
the<00:01:37.350> front<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:38.310> basically<00:01:38.729> makes<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.150> mirror

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
the front it basically makes the mirror

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.140 
the front it basically makes the mirror
and<00:01:39.810> it's<00:01:40.259> really<00:01:40.560> distracting<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.460> it's

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
and it's really distracting and it's

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.260 
and it's really distracting and it's
really<00:01:42.210> hard<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.810> focus<00:01:42.990> on<00:01:43.320> your<00:01:43.380> content

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
really hard to focus on your content

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.480 
really hard to focus on your content
when<00:01:45.270> using<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.930> retina<00:01:46.530> display<00:01:46.920> because

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
when using the retina display because

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.719 
when using the retina display because
it's<00:01:48.030> kind<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.390> semi-gloss<00:01:48.899> kind<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.729> look

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
it's kind of a semi-gloss kind of a look

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.230 
it's kind of a semi-gloss kind of a look
to<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:52.130> it's<00:01:53.130> no<00:01:53.369> more<00:01:53.520> nearly<00:01:53.939> as

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
to it so it's no more nearly as

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.440 
to it so it's no more nearly as
reflected<00:01:55.310> reflective<00:01:56.310> as<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.850> 15-inch

and<00:02:14.450> Apple<00:02:15.450> did<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:15.900> really<00:02:16.200> good<00:02:16.410> job<00:02:16.470> of

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
and Apple did a really good job of

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.339 
and Apple did a really good job of
making<00:02:17.099> this<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.670> thin<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:17.970> light<00:02:18.349> portable

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
making this a thin and light portable

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:25.070 
making this a thin and light portable
pro<00:02:20.340> machine<00:02:20.760> for<00:02:21.060> you<00:02:21.239> on<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:22.860> side<00:02:23.129> we<00:02:24.080> have

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
pro machine for you on the side we have

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.210 
pro machine for you on the side we have
our<00:02:25.849> magsafe<00:02:26.849> 2<00:02:26.879> connector<00:02:27.660> and<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.920> reason

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
our magsafe 2 connector and the reason

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.100 
our magsafe 2 connector and the reason
why<00:02:29.340> Apple<00:02:29.790> needed<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.239> go<00:02:30.390> with<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.660> magsafe

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
why Apple needed to go with the magsafe

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.920 
why Apple needed to go with the magsafe
2<00:02:31.140> is<00:02:31.849> because<00:02:33.230> um<00:02:34.489> the<00:02:35.489> chassis<00:02:36.000> is<00:02:36.030> so<00:02:36.510> thin

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
2 is because um the chassis is so thin

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.229 
2 is because um the chassis is so thin
and<00:02:37.230> even<00:02:38.010> compared<00:02:38.400> to<00:02:38.489> the<00:02:38.610> macbook<00:02:38.819> air

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
and even compared to the macbook air

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.680 
and even compared to the macbook air
this<00:02:40.049> chassis<00:02:40.560> is<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:40.890> lot<00:02:41.250> thinner<00:02:41.640> than<00:02:42.510> the

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
this chassis is a lot thinner than the

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.690 
this chassis is a lot thinner than the
macbook<00:02:43.049> air<00:02:43.290> so<00:02:43.950> that's<00:02:44.129> the<00:02:44.280> reasoning

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
macbook air so that's the reasoning

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.990 
macbook air so that's the reasoning
behind<00:02:44.760> magsafe<00:02:45.599> 2<00:02:46.610> you<00:02:47.610> have<00:02:47.760> two

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
behind magsafe 2 you have two

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.050 
behind magsafe 2 you have two

the<00:04:51.720> same<00:04:51.900> time<00:04:52.340> so<00:04:53.340> because<00:04:53.910> of<00:04:54.210> the

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
the same time so because of the

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.380 
the same time so because of the
expandability<00:04:55.020> of<00:04:55.560> the<00:04:56.310> display<00:04:56.760> output<00:04:57.180> I

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
expandability of the display output I

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.480 
expandability of the display output I
really<00:04:58.080> think<00:04:58.260> that<00:04:58.380> this<00:04:58.650> machine<00:04:59.040> is<00:04:59.220> really

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
really think that this machine is really

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.160 
really think that this machine is really
geared<00:04:59.880> towards<00:05:00.780> Pro<00:05:01.140> users<00:05:02.780> when<00:05:03.780> it<00:05:03.900> comes

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.170 
geared towards Pro users when it comes

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:07.490 
geared towards Pro users when it comes
to<00:05:04.500> the<00:05:04.740> speed<00:05:05.040> of<00:05:05.220> this<00:05:05.340> laptop<00:05:06.290> there<00:05:07.290> is<00:05:07.470> a

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
to the speed of this laptop there is a

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.850 
to the speed of this laptop there is a
noticeable<00:05:07.830> difference<00:05:08.220> in<00:05:08.730> speed<00:05:08.850> as<00:05:09.180> well

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
noticeable difference in speed as well

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.980 
noticeable difference in speed as well
now<00:05:10.860> I<00:05:10.890> compared<00:05:11.460> to<00:05:11.760> my<00:05:11.910> 2.2<00:05:12.630> gigahertz

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990

compressed the same file in five minutes
53<00:05:44.370> seconds<00:05:45.290> so<00:05:46.970> there's<00:05:47.970> about<00:05:49.550> the<00:05:50.550> 52

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
53 seconds so there's about the 52

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.690 
53 seconds so there's about the 52
second<00:05:51.450> difference<00:05:51.780> between<00:05:51.840> the<00:05:52.140> laptops

now<00:05:53.700> 52<00:05:54.240> seconds<00:05:54.780> is<00:05:54.960> under<00:05:55.200> a<00:05:55.230> minute<00:05:55.470> and<00:05:55.800> it

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
now 52 seconds is under a minute and it

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.460 
now 52 seconds is under a minute and it
may<00:05:56.550> not<00:05:56.760> seem<00:05:57.060> like<00:05:57.120> that<00:05:57.510> much<00:05:57.750> of<00:05:58.200> a<00:05:58.290> big

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.470

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:33.770 
fast I did a disk speed tests the black
magic<00:06:29.490> and<00:06:31.520> it<00:06:32.520> just<00:06:32.760> gave<00:06:32.910> me<00:06:32.970> an<00:06:33.150> error<00:06:33.330> but

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:33.780
