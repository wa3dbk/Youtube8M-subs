feel like you can educate the people to

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.820 
feel like you can educate the people to
recycle<00:02:33.850> not<00:02:34.660> only<00:02:34.840> that<00:02:34.990> we<00:02:35.380> have<00:02:35.530> a<00:02:35.560> state

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
think about it is this something that

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.670 
think about it is this something that
you<00:02:54.430> would<00:02:54.580> implement<00:02:54.880> in<00:02:55.240> your<00:02:55.300> city<00:02:55.720> it's

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
you would implement in your city it's

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.020 
you would implement in your city it's
very<00:02:56.860> exciting<00:02:57.280> because<00:02:57.430> it<00:02:57.850> integrates

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
very exciting because it integrates

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.120 
very exciting because it integrates
technology<00:02:58.450> with<00:02:59.350> doing<00:02:59.710> the<00:02:59.800> right<00:02:59.920> thing

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
technology with doing the right thing

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.620 
technology with doing the right thing
for<00:03:00.310> the<00:03:00.400> planet<00:03:00.760> and<00:03:00.910> getting<00:03:01.180> people<00:03:01.300> to<00:03:01.510> do

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
for the planet and getting people to do

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.510 
for the planet and getting people to do
the<00:03:01.750> right<00:03:01.780> thing<00:03:02.110> so<00:03:02.380> I<00:03:02.590> think<00:03:02.980> that<00:03:03.220> it's

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
the right thing so I think that it's

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.010 
the right thing so I think that it's
exciting<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.150> potential<00:03:04.630> that<00:03:04.720> it<00:03:04.870> has

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
exciting the potential that it has

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.530 
exciting the potential that it has
especially<00:03:05.440> with<00:03:05.740> our<00:03:05.830> schools<00:03:06.270> maybe<00:03:07.270> in<00:03:07.420> our

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
especially with our schools maybe in our

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.320 
especially with our schools maybe in our
zoo<00:03:07.780> and<00:03:07.990> our<00:03:08.080> parks<00:03:08.410> because<00:03:09.130> we've<00:03:10.030> got<00:03:10.180> to

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
zoo and our parks because we've got to

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.150 
zoo and our parks because we've got to
recycle<00:03:10.780> more<00:03:10.930> and<00:03:11.170> I<00:03:11.320> think<00:03:11.560> your<00:03:11.740> company's

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
recycle more and I think your company's
