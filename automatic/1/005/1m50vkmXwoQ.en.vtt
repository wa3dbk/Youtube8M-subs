it completely changed how I write music
how<00:04:42.409> I<00:04:42.439> think<00:04:42.560> about<00:04:43.039> the<00:04:43.759> kinds<00:04:44.120> of<00:04:44.210> ways<00:04:45.139> that

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:45.319 
how I think about the kinds of ways that

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:47.260 
how I think about the kinds of ways that
I<00:04:45.379> approach<00:04:45.469> the<00:04:46.129> games<00:04:46.340> that<00:04:46.550> I<00:04:46.610> do<00:04:46.729> and<00:04:47.090> the

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
I approach the games that I do and the

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.969 
I approach the games that I do and the
films<00:04:47.539> that<00:04:47.659> I<00:04:47.719> do<00:04:47.840> and<00:04:47.990> the<00:04:48.080> concert<00:04:48.530> projects

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:48.979

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
that I do etc etc and I would never have

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.969 
that I do etc etc and I would never have
had<00:04:51.889> that<00:04:52.039> experience<00:04:52.689> without<00:04:53.770> working<00:04:54.770> on

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
had that experience without working on

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:59.140 
had that experience without working on
journey<00:04:55.250> and<00:04:55.490> so<00:04:56.449> I<00:04:56.479> will<00:04:56.840> be<00:04:56.990> truly<00:04:57.909> for<00:04:58.909> the

that you write that's not something I

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.520 
that you write that's not something I
take<00:05:13.699> lightly<00:05:13.759> for<00:05:14.389> even<00:05:14.629> one<00:05:14.810> person<00:05:15.229> to<00:05:15.379> do

take lightly for even one person to do

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.969 
take lightly for even one person to do
and<00:05:16.870> so<00:05:17.870> to<00:05:17.930> be<00:05:18.259> able<00:05:18.349> to<00:05:18.500> witness<00:05:18.710> a

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
and so to be able to witness a

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:21.550 
and so to be able to witness a
reflection<00:05:19.490> back<00:05:19.639> of<00:05:20.479> what<00:05:21.169> they've<00:05:21.349> done

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
reflection back of what they've done

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.580 
reflection back of what they've done
with<00:05:21.770> that<00:05:21.889> experience<00:05:22.569> that<00:05:23.569> rewrote<00:05:24.409> me

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
with that experience that rewrote me

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.990 
with that experience that rewrote me
that<00:05:24.979> totally<00:05:25.759> on<00:05:26.270> a<00:05:26.330> DNA<00:05:26.990> level<00:05:27.229> altered<00:05:28.129> my

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
that totally on a DNA level altered my

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.769 
that totally on a DNA level altered my
sense<00:05:29.240> of<00:05:29.389> purpose

00:05:29.769 --> 00:05:29.779 
sense of purpose

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:33.219 
sense of purpose
