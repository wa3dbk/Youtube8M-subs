create the clipping mask so to do this
the<00:00:55.699> long<00:00:55.879> way<00:00:56.120> you<00:00:56.629> go<00:00:56.780> to<00:00:56.840> layer<00:00:57.309> create

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
the long way you go to layer create

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
shortcut and the way I do it and I find

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:05.680 
shortcut and the way I do it and I find
this<00:01:03.140> much<00:01:03.350> easier<00:01:03.710> is<00:01:03.980> to<00:01:04.580> hover<00:01:04.729> over<00:01:04.910> your

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
this much easier is to hover over your

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.350 
this much easier is to hover over your
two<00:01:05.899> layers<00:01:06.310> press<00:01:07.310> alt<00:01:07.670> on<00:01:08.150> your<00:01:08.180> keyboard

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.300 
the tutorial so this is a really simple
technique<00:01:36.290> on<00:01:36.979> affinity<00:01:37.939> I<00:01:38.930> have<00:01:39.860> an<00:01:40.009> image

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
technique on affinity I have an image

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.510 
technique on affinity I have an image
all<00:01:40.850> you<00:01:41.540> do<00:01:41.720> is<00:01:41.990> select<00:01:42.290> your<00:01:42.650> type<00:01:43.310> tool

all you do is select your type tool

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:52.929 
all you do is select your type tool
write<00:01:46.520> your<00:01:46.640> message<00:01:51.759> we're<00:01:52.759> going<00:01:52.880> to

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
write your message we're going to

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.530 
write your message we're going to
position<00:01:53.090> it<00:01:53.479> and<00:01:54.820> then<00:01:55.820> there's<00:01:56.240> two<00:01:56.390> ways

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
position it and then there's two ways

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.960 
position it and then there's two ways
you<00:01:56.720> can<00:01:56.810> do<00:01:56.990> this<00:01:57.020> one<00:01:57.590> which<00:01:57.979> is<00:01:58.159> so<00:01:58.670> simple

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
you can do this one which is so simple

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.209 
you can do this one which is so simple
is<00:01:59.450> you<00:02:00.110> select<00:02:00.500> your<00:02:00.680> image<00:02:01.040> and<00:02:01.310> you<00:02:01.460> put<00:02:01.670> it

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:03.219 
is you select your image and you put it

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:07.179 
is you select your image and you put it
you'd<00:02:04.219> like<00:02:04.250> drag<00:02:04.759> it<00:02:04.969> on<00:02:05.119> top<00:02:05.360> of<00:02:05.390> your<00:02:06.189> text

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
you'd like drag it on top of your text

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.969 
you'd like drag it on top of your text
and<00:02:07.369> it'll<00:02:07.520> go<00:02:07.700> and<00:02:08.570> do<00:02:08.720> that<00:02:08.869> group<00:02:09.229> and<00:02:09.530> we'll

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
and it'll go and do that group and we'll

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.479 
and it'll go and do that group and we'll
create<00:02:10.190> a<00:02:10.579> clipping<00:02:11.090> mask<00:02:11.560> if<00:02:12.560> we<00:02:12.890> take<00:02:13.370> it

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
create a clipping mask if we take it

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.990 
create a clipping mask if we take it
back<00:02:13.520> out<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:15.140> other<00:02:15.349> way<00:02:15.470> you<00:02:15.530> can<00:02:15.920> do<00:02:16.129> it

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
back out the other way you can do it

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.040 
back out the other way you can do it
select<00:02:17.210> your<00:02:17.360> text<00:02:18.580> select<00:02:19.580> this<00:02:19.790> little<00:02:20.050> icon

I<00:02:35.150> find<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:35.810> dragging<00:02:36.230> much<00:02:36.740> easier<00:02:37.070> and<00:02:37.720> kind

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
I find the dragging much easier and kind

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.530 
I find the dragging much easier and kind
of<00:02:38.750> quicker<00:02:39.020> and<00:02:39.410> then<00:02:39.950> again<00:02:40.220> you<00:02:40.430> can<00:02:40.670> move

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
of quicker and then again you can move

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.199 
of quicker and then again you can move
around<00:02:41.720> your<00:02:42.020> image<00:02:42.430> to<00:02:43.430> find<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:43.760> best<00:02:43.940> part

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
around your image to find the best part
