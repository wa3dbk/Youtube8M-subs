and it was changing and and then with

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.550 
and it was changing and and then with
about<00:01:39.190> ten<00:01:39.430> floors<00:01:39.700> to<00:01:39.910> go<00:01:40.060> I<00:01:40.090> I<00:01:40.570> kind<00:01:40.899> of<00:01:41.080> felt

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
about ten floors to go I I kind of felt

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.469 
about ten floors to go I I kind of felt
that<00:01:41.740> I<00:01:41.830> was<00:01:42.009> you<00:01:42.460> know<00:01:42.490> enough<00:01:42.880> in<00:01:43.060> front<00:01:43.330> to

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
that I was you know enough in front to

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.930 
that I was you know enough in front to
win<00:01:43.660> and<00:01:43.960> so<00:01:44.200> I<00:01:44.470> lost<00:01:44.979> a<00:01:45.100> bit<00:01:45.220> of<00:01:45.310> focus<00:01:45.490> in<00:01:45.850> the

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
win and so I lost a bit of focus in the

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.090 
win and so I lost a bit of focus in the
last<00:01:45.970> ten<00:01:46.390> floors<00:01:46.690> so<00:01:46.960> I<00:01:46.990> really<00:01:47.590> struggled<00:01:48.040> a

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
last ten floors so I really struggled a

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.580

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
bit so I'm a bit annoyed with myself but
