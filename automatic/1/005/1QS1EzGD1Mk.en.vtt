00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:24.650
 all salute with you and horn when it is 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.330
 comes about the strongest tanks of our game 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.630
 can not be ignored 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.970
 American t57 heavy about him and 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.170
 will be discussed in today's anti guide from 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.150
 ran out the company 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.430
 I suggest you identify the strengths 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.570
 side of our hero and figure out how 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.379
 confront him 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.379
 drove 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.470
 most important advantage t57 heavy 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.810
 hurricane firepower realizable 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.240
 four drum projectile count each 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.130
 shot from t57 cannon deprives the enemy 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.900
 400 strength points 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.450
 respectively for one drum 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.820
 American does an average of 1600 damage 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.220
 it seems not so dangerous but time 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.440
 full recharge drum just 25 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.600
 seconds and now think whether everyone 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.210
 a tank can inflict more than three in a minute 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.130
 thousand damage the first rule is not valid 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.710
 only for our hero but for all 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.510
 tanks with a drum loading it says 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.360
 about what to take damage from them to us 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:30.450
 extremely undesirable t57 in six seconds 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.390
 able to give 1600 damage for the same 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.460
 it's about time you're playing t-62a make 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.550
 one shot charge and maybe 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.590
 make another one that is put 640 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.930
 damage I think everything is clear so far 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.210
 it's dangerous to start a heavy shootout 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.460
 the next plus to and century magnificent 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.460
 angles of vertical guidance 8 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.530
 degrees down and 12 up such are veins 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.360
 allow you to use another strong 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.259
 tank side possessing 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.970
 ricochet form but they are a little later 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.380
 t57 universal tank and therefore in battle 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.270
 your opponent may behave 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.759
 totally unpredictable 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.009
 American has no standard positions 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.350
 such as waffles or British Fri-shka 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.540
 so the second rule get ready for 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.120
 to the unexpected appearance of havik from any 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.220
 directions in the third paragraph of the rules i 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.819
 I will try to talk about the methods of struggle 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.680
 157 heavy with a maximum speed of 35 kilometers 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.209
 an hour our hero is not very comfortable himself 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.220
 feels on open cards 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.340
 but in the city the role is played not so much 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.720
 maximum speed how much dynamics and 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.970
 steering in this heavy 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.800
 not bad for him and plays and 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.150
 turning speed in place and fast 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.160
 rotating tower 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.590
 but for us it means what kind of carousel 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.630
 it is unlikely to succeed but there are ways 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.790
 which can work at a certain 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.340
 luck the first one to disassemble the enemy 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.170
 when he recharges the drum remember a 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.510
 twenty five seconds over 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.610
 which heavy is useless and defenseless and 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.440
 use it as well as possible 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.390
 talking to him while he 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.120
 busy with a different purpose so we 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.720
 keep our own margin of safety still 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.340
 can 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.980
 merge khavik at his departure from 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.050
 shelter if the team works out of focus 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.880
 and during the update the caterpillar then one of 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.110
 the strongest tanks in the game quickly 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.390
 go to the hangar 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.520
 but it already refers to the fourth 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.460
 rules that are again universal 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.590
 and is applicable not only to the T57 heavy it 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.960
 is to focus the fire on the car 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.030
 able to do the most damage to us 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.920
 or our ally so with 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.690
 opportunity to pitch 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.910
 Heavy use it and try 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.010
 attract the attention of allies such 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.290
 actions will definitely bring the team 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.170
 profit and now imagine what you 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.510
 have to shoot in frontal projection 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.970
 t57 which points you need to target and which 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.730
 avoid the strongest armor open and 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.370
 valdis nld there 203 millimeters under 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.400
 slopes up to 65 degrees respectively 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.800
 there we do not shoot in the forehead of the tower 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.930
 sides of the gun where 137 millimeters 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.450
 located at wild angles to us a 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.370
 here you need to target nld pierce which 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.100
 will not make much effort tank guns 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.959
 even the eighth level and the base of the tower 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.209
 who confidently pierces guns with 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.550
 armor penetration in the region of 200 millimeters 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.870
 the sides and stern of the tank make their way by all 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.940
 who is not lazy but when shooting 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.950
 cumulative caterpillar shells can 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.250
 eat all the damage and need about it 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.709
 remember and the last fifth rule every 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.970
 once entering into battle 157 count on 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.890
 what controls him 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.320
 experienced player behind which no 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.210
 one thousand battles it will help you not 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.790
 relax and act adequately 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.030
 situations do not go under the drum and so 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.690
 not exactly do this with little hp 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.330
 shoot for sure 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.160
 and do not forget to follow the course of the battle 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.780
 this is my all subscribe to wot 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.460
 fan &amp; red bull company 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.460
 and with you was good bye
