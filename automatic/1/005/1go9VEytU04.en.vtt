00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:21.249
 so 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:24.249
 the india 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.949
 the child with another man 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.880
 2 so you can do it 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.710
 one the weatherman 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.710
 the 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.750
 10 the correct one 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.899
 working out the project there are only a few parties after that 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.899
 this was a good time 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.570
 other way around 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.030
 egypt 3 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.070
 at the moment of Kooten and the Bie man 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.450
 in that context of a child in a in 10 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.939
 do a profit distribution in tens in libya 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.840
 by the people 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.650
 although 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.250
 take it and that too 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.250
 local parties 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.470
 emmen that quote why not 9 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.960
 until now 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.860
 no have l 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.080
 to agree on a plan that turns the moment of panic green 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:43.399
 point 3 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.610
 the duel 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.630
 paltrow reason who wants 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.540
 a week earlier 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.620
 that I 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.720
 3 o'clock 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.679
 the pit stop also completely 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:58.970
 well 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.970
 all those and much longer than normal 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.500
 Elijah 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.420
 a 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.819
 repeated 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.280
 all who i am 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.660
 But you can't deny that there is anything more than that I could imagine 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:16.699
 therefore not give up on this 

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:19.699
 although 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.689
 men who have the euro 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:27.699
 source 

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:28.519
 to have 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.419
 the year 

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:36.589
 Also the party wants the peloton that only after he has a plate 

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:38.379
 I'm on the couch 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:41.819
 we therefore have a topper every month, we follow the 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:45.030
 lk 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.309
 o'clock 

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:47.790
 I really could not
