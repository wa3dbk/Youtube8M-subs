there so what I want to do is see how we

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.890 
there so what I want to do is see how we
would<00:04:49.920> connect<00:04:50.340> our<00:04:50.580> chargeable<00:04:51.090> battery<00:04:51.150> so

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
would connect our chargeable battery so

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.550 
would connect our chargeable battery so
here<00:04:52.050> we<00:04:52.170> have<00:04:52.320> our<00:04:52.530> USB<00:04:53.810> port<00:04:54.810> here<00:04:54.900> and<00:04:55.140> we
