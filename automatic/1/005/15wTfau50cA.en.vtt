00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.160
 how about diego happy year 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.860
 it was the first game of the season 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.540
 you come from holiday period 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.890
 I do not know if you had any doubt about how and 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.470
 order the party team without 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.220
 But the first part of the best of 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.950
 this course well yes I think the first 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.970
 time the team responded very well not 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.110
 It was the concrete thing that I would have liked 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:39.930
 but yes from the game left a one 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.100
 feeling in a very positive image in 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.739
 the start the second time also 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.770
 it was good until I think that there 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.990
 we lower a bit the rival there are a few meters 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.810
 later he found the goal he gave 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:54.100
 enthusiasm and good and luckily we could 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:57.250
 answer again very well 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.480
 to the third goal and solve a match that 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.019
 from the game I think there was no doubt 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.909
 always from the short result 10 2 to 1 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:06.729
 It always gives you the worry of not 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:10.390
 I finish is created with 3 to 1 since 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:12.550
 the meeting was on track 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.930
 hello to mister I wanted to ask you about the 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.760
 joy that there has been today in the stands 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.350
 compared to the last meetings that 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.520
 have been disputed here that will value it the 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.409
 joy that the fans have taken today 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.840
 and two like I will not ask for 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:25.180
 fernando towers yes to be ready to 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.869
 play against Real Madrid good of 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.460
 people 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.490
 wonderful today there is an atmosphere 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.250
 extraordinary people when people 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.490
 team came close people 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.470
 participated and well that does not do us well 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.090
 because it was always the story of 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.550
 Atlético de Madrid and the fans of 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.940
 athletic of madrid so let's hope that 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:49.000
 this is good for the club 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.149
 and especially the shirt to which they are 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.130
 fans who are in the stands 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:57.210
 so what they want the best has 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.210
 what to look for that way 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.580
 to give me a tower tomorrow I will train 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.110
 I think we're going to do some football and 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:10.259
 good we will see in what conditions it is and 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:13.080
 consequently afterwards we will act 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.579
 good afternoon ricardo in sodium is 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.500
 athletic I wanted to ask you about 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:18.170
 same that is growing a lot in the 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.090
 team 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.290
 despite having a different position 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.310
 to which he had last season in his 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.959
 previous team 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.030
 we are cutting the team many 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.540
 offensive alternatives with him now that 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.670
 you have more offensive options 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.069
 what ideas do you have how to combine the 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.760
 players that you have that are good at 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:39.620
 as to grima individually it was coming 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.680
 growing for a while now this 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.630
 part we have already been saying and beyond 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.670
 of the goals that reflect something 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.459
 very important to him personally 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.660
 for the team in the same way to me 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.200
 what I like the most when he returns 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.709
 when he works when he collaborates in 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.450
 the in the associated game as soon as 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.069
 retrieve a ball that makes him 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.920
 team to attack better I think that 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.420
 all that is going to be better soccer player and 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.860
 obviously much more complete for not 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.040
 occupy only the band which is a 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.260
 natural place and occupy other places that 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.519
 the team between lines I can do very 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.069
 well as for the combinations that 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:18.440
 They have front will result 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.600
 of what the parties ask of me 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.010
 matches are not all the same and I think 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.409
 with the features we have 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.659
 everyone will play and obviously we will try 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:29.540
 choose the one we think is best for 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:32.329
 every match 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.459
 hello diego there is more milk to see I wanted 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.900
 ask him for godín has appeared today 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.739
 when when I needed it the most 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.230
 team with the sun 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:42.290
 what is your opinion about it, I say good 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:45.739
 better important already has enough goals 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.569
 this season I hope you can continue in 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.140
 that line 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:53.569
 It has a personality and a hierarchy 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.480
 very important within the campus and what 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.760
 we always need in that state 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.890
 hello diego very good I wanted to ask you 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.060
 by arda turan what do you think of the party 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.680
 what he has done and if the change has been 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.959
 thinking a little bit and what is coming 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.640
 real madrid forward not see me 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:10.650
 change was made thinking about what 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.650
 I needed the equipment at that time 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.610
 and Martha in the first time shared 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:19.079
 extraordinary with 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.759
 individual talent play what 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.289
 they wanted the team to participate 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:25.430
 offensively very well and especially that 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:27.539
 is shown in the hierarchy that has the 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.710
 entering the second time was already missing 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:30.960
 I think 20 minutes, if I 'm not mistaken 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.389
 there seek to have a little more 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.610
 height without losing offensive speed 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.949
 I was having Griezmann with 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.539
 mandzukic leaving coke in the middle 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:42.509
 obviously practically does not occupy better 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:44.550
 place better places and that's why it's 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:46.349
 a change to friendship good strategy 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.819
 ask yourself by josé maría jiménez and if 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:50.219
 It is making you very difficult when you are 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:54.040
 well miranda when choosing between 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:55.870
 limiting good are the best 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.210
 decisions that one can have as 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.540
 coach when there is so much competition 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:03.310
 in a sector we need Miranda 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:05.470
 urgent is a player who has given us 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.920
 many joys as a player 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.780
 fundamental in this in these three years 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.570
 that takes the athletic one of madrid and 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.370
 jiménez comes pushing from the best 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.860
 way you can talk that playing 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.840
 well I never never understand the 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.090
 players who speak in newspapers 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.070
 I think the only way there is in 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.690
 the football of speaking is when it touches you and 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.360
 the coach of the shirt prove it 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:31.560
 and he has shown it with facts that 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.150
 only thing that counts in this mind 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.590
 as it assumes a week with two 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.050
 matches against Real Madrid and another against 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.529
 the Barcelona 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.689
 normal with the 

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:42.669
 tranquility of having won today that 

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:45.549
 what they needed for the start of 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:49.689
 league and good tomorrow we will prepare from a 

00:05:45.549 --> 00:05:52.899
 little the cup game that is very 

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:55.269
 important and consequently of good 

00:05:52.899 --> 00:05:57.609
 that was less day for Barcelona 

00:05:55.269 --> 00:05:59.939
 but following the same line from 

00:05:57.609 --> 00:05:59.939
 forever
