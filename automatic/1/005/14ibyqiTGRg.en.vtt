hello<00:00:01.560> everyone<00:00:01.860> this<00:00:02.820> is<00:00:02.879> a<00:00:03.060> short<00:00:03.480> video<00:00:03.600> to

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
hello everyone this is a short video to

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.079 
hello everyone this is a short video to
show<00:00:03.810> you<00:00:03.990> the<00:00:04.980> pc<00:00:05.370> simulation<00:00:05.879> of<00:00:05.970> the

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
show you the pc simulation of the

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.080 
show you the pc simulation of the
popular<00:00:06.480> arcade<00:00:06.629> game<00:00:06.990> you<00:00:07.170> beat<00:00:07.379> and

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.090 
popular arcade game you beat and

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.610 
popular arcade game you beat and
basically<00:00:09.090> you<00:00:09.240> assign<00:00:09.510> a<00:00:09.540> key<00:00:09.870> on<00:00:10.559> your

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
basically you assign a key on your

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.919 
basically you assign a key on your
keyboard<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.460> correspond<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.450> each<00:00:12.540> of<00:00:12.809> those

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
keyboard to correspond to each of those

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.620 
keyboard to correspond to each of those
16<00:00:13.380> boxes<00:00:13.559> or<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.009> p<00:00:14.309> on<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.460> screen<00:00:14.759> and<00:00:14.940> you

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
16 boxes or a p on the screen and you

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.240 
16 boxes or a p on the screen and you
play<00:00:15.900> on<00:00:16.170> your<00:00:16.199> keyboard<00:00:16.619> rather<00:00:17.010> than

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
play on your keyboard rather than

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.120 
play on your keyboard rather than
hitting<00:00:17.430> on<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:17.699> panel<00:00:17.990> so<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.859> is<00:00:20.010> quite

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
hitting on a panel so it is quite

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.779 
hitting on a panel so it is quite
different<00:00:20.609> but<00:00:20.760> at<00:00:21.060> least<00:00:21.300> it's<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.990> closest

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
different but at least it's the closest

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:24.859 
different but at least it's the closest
simulation<00:00:23.789> that<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.210> can<00:00:24.359> get<00:00:24.539> in<00:00:24.779> a

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
simulation that you can get in a

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.080 
simulation that you can get in a
computer<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.970> so<00:00:27.199> basically<00:00:28.609> your<00:00:29.609> school<00:00:29.939> be

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
computer and so basically your school be

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.729 
computer and so basically your school be
shown<00:00:30.330> here<00:00:31.730> yep<00:00:32.730> my<00:00:32.969> cursor<00:00:33.329> yes<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:34.530> will<00:00:34.620> be

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
shown here yep my cursor yes it will be

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.720 
shown here yep my cursor yes it will be
shown<00:00:34.950> here<00:00:35.190> but<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.600> bonus<00:00:37.020> 100k<00:00:38.010> won't<00:00:38.579> be

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
shown here but the bonus 100k won't be

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.110 
shown here but the bonus 100k won't be
included<00:00:39.300> won't<00:00:39.930> be<00:00:40.140> included<00:00:40.590> yep<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:41.219> the

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
included won't be included yep so the

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.030 
included won't be included yep so the
full<00:00:42.480> monty<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.020> most<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.649> can<00:00:43.860> get

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
full monty the most that you can get

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.910 
full monty the most that you can get
here<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.750> 900<00:00:45.750> k<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.430> and<00:00:48.140> then<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.379> just

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
here is 900 k and and then you just

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.850 
here is 900 k and and then you just
select<00:00:50.640> your<00:00:50.910> marker<00:00:51.210> if<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.480> want<00:00:51.690> i<00:00:52.140> created

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
select your marker if you want i created

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.010 
select your marker if you want i created
some<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.309> new<00:00:53.550> markets<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.360> realistic

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
some of the new markets the realistic

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.650 
some of the new markets the realistic
markets<00:00:55.379> like<00:00:55.680> flour<00:00:55.949> flash<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.730> default<00:00:57.480> one

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
markets like flour flash and default one

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.580 
markets like flour flash and default one
and<00:00:57.899> i<00:00:59.000> use<00:01:00.000> flour<00:01:00.270> commonly<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:00.960> i'll<00:01:01.559> just

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
and i use flour commonly so i'll just

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.580 
and i use flour commonly so i'll just
use<00:01:02.250> flour<00:01:02.640> demonstrate<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:05.390> so<00:01:06.470> when<00:01:07.470> you

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
use flour demonstrate and so when you

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.380 
use flour demonstrate and so when you
when<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:07.799> hit<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.130> thing<00:01:08.340> perfectly<00:01:08.820> time<00:01:09.090> as

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
when you hit the thing perfectly time as

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.270 
when you hit the thing perfectly time as
you<00:01:09.750> know<00:01:09.869> like<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.619> know<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.860> ball<00:01:11.070> you

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
you know like you know the ball you

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.719 
you know like you know the ball you
little<00:01:11.549> bar<00:01:11.820> on<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.840> screen<00:01:13.320> above<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:14.400> panel

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
little bar on a screen above the panel

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.850 
little bar on a screen above the panel
you<00:01:14.790> playing<00:01:15.060> there's<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.810> when<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.650> when<00:01:16.830> you

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
you playing there's a when you when you

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.980 
you playing there's a when you when you
hit<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.400> perfectly<00:01:17.729> time<00:01:18.000> then<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.600> appears

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
hit it perfectly time then it appears

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.399 
hit it perfectly time then it appears
yellow<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.500> here<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.950> will<00:01:20.070> appear<00:01:20.369> as<00:01:20.549> green<00:01:21.060> I

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
yellow in here it will appear as green I

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.719 
yellow in here it will appear as green I
don't<00:01:22.409> know<00:01:22.470> why<00:01:22.650> it's<00:01:22.830> green<00:01:23.040> but<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.490> is

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
don't know why it's green but it is

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.179 
don't know why it's green but it is
green<00:01:23.909> here<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.299> if<00:01:25.140> it's<00:01:25.350> not<00:01:25.560> perfectly

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
green here and if it's not perfectly

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.310 
green here and if it's not perfectly
time<00:01:26.460> it<00:01:26.700> will<00:01:26.850> appear<00:01:27.060> as<00:01:27.119> yellow<00:01:27.450> very

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
time it will appear as yellow very

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.249 
time it will appear as yellow very
strange<00:01:28.590> but<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.579> works<00:01:29.970> like<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.600> if

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
strange but it works like that and if

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.800 
strange but it works like that and if
you<00:01:31.350> miss<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:32.009> will<00:01:32.159> be<00:01:32.280> blue<00:01:32.729> or<00:01:33.380> black<00:01:34.380> and

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
you miss it it will be blue or black and

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.210 
you miss it it will be blue or black and
yeah<00:01:36.810> that's<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.350> then<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.770> background

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
yeah that's it and then the background

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.219 
yeah that's it and then the background
will<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:39.210> there's<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.540> little<00:01:39.689> gate<00:01:39.960> in<00:01:40.140> the

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
will that there's a little gate in the

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.710 
will that there's a little gate in the
background<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:41.130> if<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.549> play<00:01:41.850> your<00:01:42.119> combos

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
background so if you play your combos

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.590 
background so if you play your combos
quite<00:01:43.049> fluently<00:01:43.500> then<00:01:44.119> the<00:01:45.119> gate<00:01:45.329> will<00:01:45.509> be

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
quite fluently then the gate will be

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.510 
quite fluently then the gate will be
fully<00:01:45.840> open<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.380> background<00:01:47.009> we<00:01:47.100> change<00:01:47.369> to

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
fully open and background we change to

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.940 
fully open and background we change to
yellow<00:01:47.670> like<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.390> old<00:01:48.810> version<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.770> beat

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
yellow like the old version of you beat

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.210 
yellow like the old version of you beat
and<00:01:50.220> not<00:01:50.939> ripples<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:52.040> basically<00:01:53.040> that's

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
and not ripples and basically that's

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.990 
and not ripples and basically that's
ruse<00:01:53.549> so<00:01:54.829> you<00:01:55.829> can<00:01:55.979> select<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.369> songs<00:01:56.610> have

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
ruse so you can select the songs have

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.700 
ruse so you can select the songs have
quite<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.450> lot<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.750> songs<00:01:57.960> here<00:01:58.229> because<00:01:58.439> the

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
quite a lot of songs here because the

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.310 
quite a lot of songs here because the
default<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.340> I<00:02:00.240> can't<00:02:00.780> remember<00:02:00.930> how<00:02:01.290> many

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
default is I can't remember how many

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.160 
default is I can't remember how many
songs<00:02:01.710> are<00:02:01.950> there<00:02:02.100> but<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.759> should<00:02:03.240> be<00:02:03.270> 14<00:02:03.960> and

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
songs are there but it should be 14 and

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.490 
songs are there but it should be 14 and
now<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:04.890> have<00:02:05.159> 74<00:02:05.909> so<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.299> added<00:02:06.659> sixty<00:02:07.200> dollars

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
now I have 74 so I added sixty dollars

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
going to play a little song and just get

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.710 
going to play a little song and just get
you<00:02:25.739> the<00:02:25.890> idea<00:02:26.370> of<00:02:26.550> what<00:02:26.790> is<00:02:26.910> it<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.239> then<00:02:27.480> like

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
you the idea of what is it and then like

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.199 
you the idea of what is it and then like
how<00:02:27.959> is<00:02:28.019> it<00:02:28.170> like<00:02:28.319> in<00:02:28.500> gameplay<00:02:28.709> I<00:02:29.160> did<00:02:29.879> I'm<00:02:30.060> not

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
how is it like in gameplay I did I'm not

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.820 
how is it like in gameplay I did I'm not
sure<00:02:30.269> whether<00:02:30.569> it<00:02:31.049> will<00:02:31.260> have<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.440> little<00:02:31.709> bit

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
sure whether it will have a little bit

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.009 
sure whether it will have a little bit
of<00:02:31.860> delay<00:02:32.040> because<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:33.299> recording<00:02:33.810> software

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
of delay because the recording software

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:40.009 
of delay because the recording software
is<00:02:34.849> and<00:02:35.849> is<00:02:36.150> going<00:02:37.140> funny<00:02:37.349> so<00:02:38.810> let's<00:02:39.810> see<00:02:39.930> how

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
is and is going funny so let's see how

00:02:40.019 --> 00:04:36.050 
is and is going funny so let's see how
it<00:02:40.049> goes

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.129 

so<00:04:36.660> that's<00:04:36.840> it<00:04:36.990> my<00:04:37.860> score<00:04:38.130> is<00:04:38.300> 781<00:04:39.300> so<00:04:39.990> that

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
so that's it my score is 781 so that

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:42.020 
so that's it my score is 781 so that
means<00:04:40.320> it<00:04:40.500> as<00:04:41.160> this<00:04:41.340> is<00:04:41.460> the<00:04:41.550> background<00:04:41.910> is

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
means it as this is the background is

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.610 
means it as this is the background is
fully<00:04:42.240> open<00:04:42.300> the<00:04:42.690> gate<00:04:42.840> is<00:04:42.960> fully<00:04:43.139> open<00:04:43.230> and<00:04:43.440> so

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
fully open the gate is fully open and so

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.420 
fully open the gate is fully open and so
is<00:04:43.940> 881<00:04:44.940> my<00:04:45.150> final<00:04:45.450> score<00:04:45.690> well<00:04:46.320> it's<00:04:46.650> it's<00:04:46.919> a

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
is 881 my final score well it's it's a

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.550 
is 881 my final score well it's it's a
great<00:04:47.700> but<00:04:48.000> I'm<00:04:48.630> not<00:04:48.900> satisfied<00:04:49.110> with<00:04:49.410> that

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
great but I'm not satisfied with that

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.370 
great but I'm not satisfied with that
because<00:04:50.330> my<00:04:51.330> best<00:04:51.570> score<00:04:51.840> is<00:04:51.960> actually

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
because my best score is actually

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.909 
because my best score is actually
something<00:04:52.740> like<00:04:53.120> 93<00:04:54.120> well<00:04:54.780> in<00:04:54.990> in<00:04:55.290> route<00:04:55.500> in<00:04:55.830> a

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
something like 93 well in in route in a

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.120 
something like 93 well in in route in a
real<00:04:56.160> machine<00:04:56.580> I<00:04:56.660> haven't<00:04:57.660> I<00:04:57.919> haven't<00:04:58.919> been

real machine I haven't I haven't been

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.010 
real machine I haven't I haven't been
able<00:04:59.250> to<00:04:59.430> unlock<00:04:59.940> it<00:05:00.000> because<00:05:00.330> my<00:05:00.540> grade<00:05:00.900> is

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
able to unlock it because my grade is

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.850 
able to unlock it because my grade is
too<00:05:01.200> low<00:05:01.350> and<00:05:02.360> well<00:05:03.360> yeah<00:05:03.930> you<00:05:03.990> hope<00:05:04.470> you<00:05:04.680> get
