00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.300 
consumable it is and how much it would
be<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.570> transfer<00:01:39.570> them<00:01:39.720> all<00:01:39.869> over<00:01:40.049> so<00:01:40.409> if<00:01:40.799> i<00:01:41.009> got

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
be to transfer them all over so if i got

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.889 
be to transfer them all over so if i got
a<00:01:41.340> striker<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.880> went<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.270> transfer<00:01:42.630> them<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.780> a

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
a striker and went to transfer them to a

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.840 
a striker and went to transfer them to a
sentiment<00:01:43.409> geometry<00:01:44.189> with<00:01:44.310> course<00:01:44.520> i<00:01:44.670> think

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
sentiment geometry with course i think

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.310 
sentiment geometry with course i think
it<00:01:44.909> costs<00:01:45.119> around<00:01:45.180> three<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.720> four<00:01:45.899> thousand

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
it costs around three to four thousand

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.139 
it costs around three to four thousand
coins<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:47.040> hunter<00:01:47.399> so<00:01:47.700> for<00:01:47.970> three

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
coins and the hunter so for three

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.780 
coins and the hunter so for three
thousand<00:01:48.540> coins<00:01:48.899> plus<00:01:49.320> or<00:01:49.740> that's<00:01:50.310> how<00:01:50.430> much<00:01:50.579> I

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
thousand coins plus or that's how much I

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.450 
thousand coins plus or that's how much I
value<00:01:51.689> adds<00:01:51.899> on<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.350> so<00:01:52.860> that<00:01:52.890> would<00:01:53.430> be

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
value adds on to it so that would be

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.010 
value adds on to it so that would be
about<00:01:53.820> seven<00:01:54.210> thousand<00:01:54.509> coins<00:01:54.659> or<00:01:54.869> if<00:01:54.930> I

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
about seven thousand coins or if I

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.709 
about seven thousand coins or if I
picked<00:01:55.170> him<00:01:55.259> up<00:01:55.470> for<00:01:55.799> in<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.640> cm<00:01:56.969> with<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.270> hunter

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
picked him up for in a cm with a hunter

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.899 
picked him up for in a cm with a hunter
I<00:01:57.930> could<00:01:58.320> potentially<00:01:59.250> sell<00:01:59.430> them<00:01:59.549> for<00:01:59.729> eight

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
I could potentially sell them for eight

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.940 
I could potentially sell them for eight
to<00:02:00.390> nine<00:02:00.570> thousand<00:02:01.049> coins<00:02:01.229> which<00:02:01.829> is

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
to nine thousand coins which is

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.160 
to nine thousand coins which is
absolutely<00:02:02.280> insane<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:03.270> i<00:02:03.869> would<00:02:04.140> recommend

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
absolutely insane and i would recommend

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.440 
absolutely insane and i would recommend
using<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.890> chemistry<00:02:05.340> sold<00:02:05.549> engine<00:02:06.090> as<00:02:06.299> it

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
using the chemistry sold engine as it

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.229 
using the chemistry sold engine as it
goes<00:02:06.600> for<00:02:06.810> 2k<00:02:07.200> hunter<00:02:07.979> catalyst<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:08.879> shadow

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
goes for 2k hunter catalyst and shadow

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.580 
goes for 2k hunter catalyst and shadow
wouldn't<00:02:09.629> recommend<00:02:09.959> using<00:02:10.110> any<00:02:10.349> of<00:02:10.440> the

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
wouldn't recommend using any of the

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.860 
wouldn't recommend using any of the
other<00:02:10.770> ones<00:02:10.800> maybe<00:02:11.400> sniper<00:02:11.819> it<00:02:12.120> is<00:02:12.270> a<00:02:12.480> decent

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
other ones maybe sniper it is a decent

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.980 
other ones maybe sniper it is a decent
deal<00:02:13.230> but<00:02:13.440> they<00:02:13.530> only<00:02:13.650> go

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
deal but they only go

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.500 
deal but they only go
1000<00:02:14.650> coins<00:02:14.830> so<00:02:15.310> you<00:02:15.400> have<00:02:15.550> to<00:02:15.670> be<00:02:15.700> thinking<00:02:15.970> of

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
1000 coins so you have to be thinking of

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.360 
1000 coins so you have to be thinking of
how<00:02:16.690> many<00:02:16.750> how<00:02:17.170> much<00:02:17.320> coins<00:02:17.590> you<00:02:18.010> could<00:02:18.220> be

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
how many how much coins you could be

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.340 
how many how much coins you could be
making<00:02:18.610> so<00:02:18.910> that<00:02:18.940> potentially<00:02:19.570> by<00:02:19.750> you<00:02:20.200> could

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
making so that potentially by you could

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.530 
making so that potentially by you could
actually<00:02:20.410> pick<00:02:20.920> that<00:02:21.160> Boateng<00:02:21.880> up<00:02:22.090> there<00:02:22.390> and

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
actually pick that Boateng up there and

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.360 
actually pick that Boateng up there and
probably<00:02:22.660> this<00:02:22.930> them<00:02:23.080> up<00:02:23.200> for<00:02:23.350> a<00:02:23.380> bit<00:02:23.590> more<00:02:23.800> but

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
probably this them up for a bit more but

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.920 
probably this them up for a bit more but
all<00:02:24.520> you<00:02:24.670> got<00:02:24.790> to<00:02:24.850> do<00:02:24.910> stuff<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.240> strike<00:02:25.540> it<00:02:25.570> if

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
all you got to do stuff and strike it if

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.630 
all you got to do stuff and strike it if
you<00:02:26.080> are<00:02:26.200> stuck<00:02:26.500> and<00:02:26.680> there<00:02:27.160> is<00:02:27.250> no<00:02:27.430> more

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
you are stuck and there is no more

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.640 
you are stuck and there is no more
camped<00:02:28.060> for<00:02:28.090> you<00:02:28.390> so<00:02:28.600> clapping<00:02:28.930> striker<00:02:29.350> and

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
camped for you so clapping striker and

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.230 
camped for you so clapping striker and
this<00:02:29.800> Danny<00:02:30.070> Welbeck<00:02:30.490> comes<00:02:30.700> up<00:02:30.910> so<00:02:31.060> in<00:02:31.180> a

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
this Danny Welbeck comes up so in a

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.740 
this Danny Welbeck comes up so in a
church<00:02:31.450> church<00:02:32.260> Danny<00:02:32.710> Welbeck<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.570> see<00:02:34.570> how

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
church church Danny Welbeck and see how

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.540 
church church Danny Welbeck and see how
many<00:02:34.810> there<00:02:35.050> are<00:02:35.230> on<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.590> market<00:02:35.830> in<00:02:36.160> a<00:02:36.280> cam

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
many there are on the market in a cam

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.580 
many there are on the market in a cam
position<00:02:37.030> I<00:02:37.180> believe<00:02:37.690> there<00:02:37.870> was<00:02:37.960> no<00:02:38.140> hunters

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
position I believe there was no hunters

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.540 
position I believe there was no hunters
or<00:02:38.860> strike<00:02:39.610> or<00:02:40.390> like<00:02:40.840> general<00:02:41.620> players<00:02:41.950> but

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
or strike or like general players but

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.190 
or strike or like general players but
that<00:02:42.970> is<00:02:43.150> not<00:02:43.420> a<00:02:43.480> problem<00:02:43.810> at<00:02:43.900> all<00:02:44.020> because

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
that is not a problem at all because

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.960 
that is not a problem at all because
there's<00:02:44.560> many<00:02:44.800> many<00:02:44.980> players<00:02:45.280> on<00:02:45.490> the<00:02:45.550> market

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
there's many many players on the market

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.870 
there's many many players on the market
and<00:02:46.180> it<00:02:47.080> does<00:02:47.350> actually<00:02:47.710> work<00:02:48.010> as<00:02:48.370> well<00:02:48.550> as<00:02:48.580> you

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
and it does actually work as well as you

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.180 
and it does actually work as well as you
saw<00:02:49.030> from<00:02:49.150> my<00:02:49.330> tray<00:02:49.540> file<00:02:49.780> so<00:02:50.020> I<00:02:50.260> gotta<00:02:50.560> do<00:02:50.740> so

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
saw from my tray file so I gotta do so

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.220 
saw from my tray file so I gotta do so
to<00:02:51.250> prepare<00:02:51.460> specifically<00:02:52.120> isn't<00:02:52.840> a<00:02:52.870> method

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
to prepare specifically isn't a method

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.350 
to prepare specifically isn't a method
where<00:02:53.650> you<00:02:53.680> just<00:02:54.040> have<00:02:54.490> to<00:02:54.730> find<00:02:55.060> general

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
where you just have to find general

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.940 
where you just have to find general
players<00:02:55.660> after<00:02:55.870> searching<00:02:56.260> them<00:02:56.380> pacifically

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
players after searching them pacifically

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.070 
players after searching them pacifically
and<00:02:57.250> that<00:02:57.790> is<00:02:57.910> a<00:02:57.940> bad<00:02:58.240> thing<00:02:58.300> lettuce<00:02:58.750> method

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
and that is a bad thing lettuce method

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.270 
and that is a bad thing lettuce method
as<00:02:59.230> you<00:02:59.470> have<00:02:59.560> to<00:02:59.680> know<00:02:59.800> which<00:03:00.010> players

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
as you have to know which players

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.490 
as you have to know which players
actually<00:03:01.180> decent<00:03:01.810> or<00:03:02.140> no<00:03:02.230> I<00:03:02.260> wouldn't

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
actually decent or no I wouldn't

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.050 
actually decent or no I wouldn't
recommend<00:03:02.770> doing<00:03:03.010> players<00:03:03.370> are<00:03:03.550> really<00:03:03.760> bad

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
recommend doing players are really bad

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.630 
recommend doing players are really bad
maybe<00:03:04.750> like<00:03:04.960> 50<00:03:05.710> pace<00:03:05.920> or<00:03:06.070> under<00:03:06.280> I<00:03:06.310> wouldn't

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
maybe like 50 pace or under I wouldn't

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.250 
maybe like 50 pace or under I wouldn't
recommend<00:03:06.820> doing<00:03:06.970> any<00:03:07.300> of<00:03:07.330> them<00:03:07.510> more<00:03:08.080> like

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
recommend doing any of them more like

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.170 
recommend doing any of them more like
highly<00:03:08.710> known<00:03:08.890> players<00:03:09.190> and<00:03:09.520> not<00:03:09.670> from<00:03:09.820> random
