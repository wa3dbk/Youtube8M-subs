00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello a beach chair and warm 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:08.429
 Welcome to the most important muscle building 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:11.580
 Tip the world would be really nice biceps 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.889
 wide shoulders sixpack beautiful massive 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.650
 breast and so on athletically build up 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.080
 If you want this tip then you should 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.850
 but take into account every case 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.830
 funny thing is he has now 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.170
 nothing to do with the training 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.180
 So with something like the chemistry already 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.070
 in the muscle or something and also nothing 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.520
 the diet so what you eat so everything 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.030
 needs to build muscle and so on 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:38.489
 but rather had to do pascal if 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.140
 You now ask a coach in the fourth 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.910
 study what you mean for one 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.280
 Hiring needs to succeed 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.539
 to be able to train and over the years 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.340
 not just one year, but 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.410
 really over the years like me the other day 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.789
 motivation video has really shown 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.160
 to exercise the rest of your life 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.590
 then inevitably always or 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.719
 also in discussions the word discipline 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.180
 that means we have to fall 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.850
 be disciplined all know that the 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.100
 most important for muscle building is 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:08.850
 Discipline you know that's true too 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.000
 Unfortunately this is wrong discipline brings 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.140
 absolutely nothing for muscle building 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.930
 Discipline is just a attitude 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.479
 that something has to do so discipline 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.150
 is basically a kind of forcing me 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.310
 must do something to achieve something 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.229
 but the discipline alone leads to it 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.259
 no success but only the implement 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.430
 doing that leads to success that is when 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.750
 Let's make a little formula now 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.549
 We can say discipline leads to it 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.229
 I can eat a healthy diet that 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.590
 I move to the sport and that 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:48.090
 But then leads to success the implementation 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.909
 yes so and now I say that we have this 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.310
 concept of discipline and 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.340
 Although fun because I can also with 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.170
 fun to feed me healthy and i can 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.820
 also go into training with fun and 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.229
 to succeed and when to enter 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.810
 go to the gym or the long 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:09.899
 faces so points to yes but have 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.610
 There is no passion then 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.930
 I wonder if I have something 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.700
 So I'm only talking for myself now 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.890
 really if i do something over years 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.230
 which I do not want 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.090
 what is the probability that I am 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.040
 the whole by goals not very high 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.500
 whereas if I'm using something right 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.400
 make a lot of fun and engagement and 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.590
 thereby sales 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.110
 then I have much more prospects 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.510
 Success therefore the most important tip for 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.930
 is muscle-building around the world 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.000
 in my opinion to have fun with the 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.280
 whole things to go in yes 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.959
 studio fun to have I have too 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.070
 posted on facebook for the first time by 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.840
 because of both the one wife to me 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.459
 team and me immediately after the motto yes 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.140
 Ok let's see what I can do then 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.209
 do not bother twice as loud and 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.160
 Study Yes, that is to say , people accept 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.900
 a little bit on the arm, it takes everything 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.209
 not so serious on this whole pose 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.280
 and so i'm always down when 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.540
 when training from the mirror but it is 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.280
 everything just for fun 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.840
 i do not take the whole thing too seriously i 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.090
 do not take myself too seriously yes 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.120
 because if somebody somehow says you are 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.400
 a crass substance or mixture namely 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.750
 stimulants or you're full of stark 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.299
 wide you think you're over cool now 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.280
 then I do not take it seriously then 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.920
 I'll mess with him 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.350
 me funny so have fun and stay relaxed 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.420
 at the whole yes that is always the case 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.820
 this dichotomy you have to penetrate hard 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.680
 take a close look but still loose 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:36.250
 stay with it and have fun developing it 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:39.580
 Things and fun always lead in the long run 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:43.600
 to become more successful by doing more 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.380
 implements and does more than pure 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.060
 discipline 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.070
 that was it for the most important 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.660
 muscle building tip of the world of mine 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.160
 opinion you can even like times 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.870
 your opinion you write under 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.790
 can also say corridors at all 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.959
 no idea what you're talking about without 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.940
 discipline is no good 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.739
 I'm always in the field of this criticism 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.110
 okay that was my video on the subject of fun 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.769
 the most important muscle building tip that too 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.310
 claim 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.380
 if you have more 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.819
 you want to see muscle growth then you can 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.980
 you just have a muscle up here 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.390
 wednesday from last week look there 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.580
 I have a bit of that prevented 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.130
 rowing showed a very good exercise for 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.950
 the broad back muscles which here and 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.019
 also the license or you can on 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.910
 the guide also the beautiful vegan 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.669
 looks at recipes and at the gladiator 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.139
 So, coach wants to look right 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.909
 christ out of the series 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:31.639
 can you do well before training here 

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:32.629
 then these processes are always good 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:37.840
 in muscle building 

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:37.840
 i would say a qr barcode on the beach
