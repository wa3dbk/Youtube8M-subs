00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 the boys are baxter now a new one 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.730
 video tutorial in which I will explain 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.610
 like having endless snow on minecraft 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:14.009
 first thing first I wanted 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.260
 tell you is that during the rain to you 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.660
 you have to build a roof on yours 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.090
 snowman if he won't die 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.539
 second thing i'll show you how 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.789
 it works we take a shovel 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.720
 if we take iron because more more 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.540
 beautiful in my opinion then we go into mode 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.360
 survival and let's go here and continue to 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.350
 find out until the shovel ends 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.940
 let's see the ball wears out and 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.739
 we continue to collect snow this 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.550
 because why the snowman is 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.530
 sitting on that block and that block 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.250
 there it always goes on to become snow but if 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.559
 we remove it because it worries us is 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.890
 the puppet will always become snow now 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.109
 let's see how to build this one 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.789
 shop you go well this shop 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.530
 sorry I just did the opinion 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:07.770
 of the shocks I loaded before 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:10.460
 this and I am the survival me 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.460
 noticed now 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.340
 we take a piece of material from 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:21.149
 building the beauty of this one of this 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:27.689
 what i show you is that you 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:34.280
 you can have infinite snow as it says 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:37.289
 even if that is also infinite blocks 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.000
 I'm trying to tell you this 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:41.729
 also have infinite blocks beyond 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.709
 infinite snow also blocks the 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.090
 building wanting because that can 

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:47.909
 also be used as a block from 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.590
 snow construction ok to do the 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.250
 snowman you need one 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:56.009
 pumpkin and snow blocks 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.349
 then we put one two blocks of snow 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.520
 let's put that pumpkin we put a quick one 

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:03.810
 shelter 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.909
 ok and this is our our source 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.619
 endless snow we put the 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.890
 survival and we see that we continue to 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:18.660
 collect we will continue to collect 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:21.500
 snow with us we put it so we will have 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.500
 many blocks 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.250
