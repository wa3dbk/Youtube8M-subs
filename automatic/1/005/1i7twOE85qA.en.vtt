00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 and it's time to buy a used car 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:08.189
 also how to know if you are taking 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.590
 there to the garage a vehicle full of 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.450
 problems a vehicle that was flooded 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.429
 Who's going to give us important tips? 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.830
 now on this subject will talk 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.090
 with us it's a mechanics that's right 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.180
 a woman 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.250
 Roseli understands more than I do by car. 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.710
 what the rosetta rosely that good good 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.260
 day where the grace of the trunk all great 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.579
 Pleasure to talk to you now, Roseli. 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.680
 woman understands mechanics and says 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.000
 who is afraid to understand a little to 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.610
 not be passed behind 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.800
 right now roseli a question that 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.870
 sure, who's at home is doing it? 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.950
 now we show several cars 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.960
 underwater 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.480
 several cars that spoiled this 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.910
 problem and then I'll ask you in the 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.530
 time to buy a new car how come 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.719
 I wonder if this car that I am 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.640
 buying stayed in a flood stayed 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.680
 submerged is in the situation that people 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.800
 showed the report now has as 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.129
 figure it does have to have several 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:09.650
 Hints are checking mainly 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:12.510
 carpet, the situation of the banks is 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.760
 take the car to a mechanic's workshop or 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.540
 lying under the car check if 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.880
 Do you have any rusty items? 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.369
 so it's very easy to identify the car 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.950
 had people understand now for example? 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.990
 Did you mention the carpet, that's when 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.990
 the person has to be attentive how is that 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.880
 the carpet stays when the car 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.579
 submerged for example has a person 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.430
 to identify so eta has yes because 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.799
 when the carpet did not pick up moisture it 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.079
 has a certain shape and when it 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.560
 he took moisture mainly in the 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.659
 side of the car near the 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.909
 what happens it starts to drop off the 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.549
 bad smell then sometimes just changing the 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.380
 time is not the time to change to the cold in 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.369
 temperature changes you already feel the bad 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.200
 smell in the car 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.659
 rosana and it looks like there's a car near 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.340
 You 're going to show us some good. 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.979
 I will ask our cameraman show 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.009
 For those of you who are from the Alexandre 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:11.069
 cameraman on the scale is 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.660
 I can chandran it, there you can 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.890
 and that's how we stay there 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.170
 in relation to the engine 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.510
 show us people in the last 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.170
 people want to learn also look first 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:25.380
 step your car caught flood then it is 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.660
 suddenly a highway is a tip 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.570
 It's very important that I do the 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.540
 lectures and I speak to people, it's you 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.790
 to get a bag of water suddenly 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.340
 volume of water is going up which should 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.560
 be done get out of the car do not stay in 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.730
 because the team contains the parts 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:47.580
 where you have there are locks 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:51.390
 electrical alarms and this causes 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.190
 can wet the module ends up locking 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.260
 every vehicle you have no condition 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.989
 after leaving him showing us 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.450
 this engine what could not what did not 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.459
 for example in this engine which 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.880
 You 're showing us people. Now, look. 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:09.510
 What you can not look at is a silly story, right? 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:12.090
 wires can not be looking, that 's where the 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.840
 water mainly enters the filter 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.910
 air 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.870
 then felt until the water volume was 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.140
 great 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.930
 the engine it will admit water here 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.579
 superstition and goes straight to the engine 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.470
 then that tube of the air filter or 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.660
 water can enter through here into the 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.420
 motor or, in other words, any 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.430
 any lonely street that we 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.709
 is try to pass by 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.600
 somehow it will wet that part of 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.500
 a lower part is just above the 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.959
 middle wheel 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.140
 many cars without problems sometimes only 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:46.230
 the fact that you got the rain that happens 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:49.049
 it's just watering the module it ends up watering 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.209
 the coil is not looking at these parts 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.070
 components causes the car to 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.260
 scamming the car is failing 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.120
 then is one that is defective 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.310
 intermittent one hour gives defect exchange 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.750
 It does not work, it's another tip. 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.530
 important too 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:07.079
 passing the sea in a flood is not to have 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.660
 Care for water was entering the engine 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:12.720
 looking here I'll show you by the 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:17.010
 exhaust is exactly right 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.780
 So the water she can not can not can not 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:22.250
 through the exhaust because the water 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.530
 through the exhaust underneath 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.960
 is that this guy is a little more 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.360
 inside, this is having a scene that button 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.570
 as a boy had no show 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.630
 entering the water here will admit the 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.800
 engine will admit to admitting this water 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.400
 admitting this water goes into the 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.470
 motor 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.230
 So how will I know if the engine is running? 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.930
 Bad or not, I'll show you that 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:47.690
 is very simple liked the roseli in it 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.580
 It's very good, now let me tell you one 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.440
 business for you rose there are you brought 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.990
 some pieces there to show 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.630
 people are important parts also with 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:59.960
 relation to the cars that remain there is 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:02.330
 arrested in transit and in that 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.970
 Do not worry about those floods 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.540
 are important parts mainly 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.090
 clutch 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.620
 the engine starts when wet clutch 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.870
 motor starts skating then that 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.590
 you can get out and the car 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.169
 do not leave 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.330
 can be also this problem is another 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:20.480
 problem something else that should 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:22.460
 to be checked is the sump the position was 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.610
 the part of the engine that is going to 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:28.790
 below, then try to see if this 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:31.310
 charge did not suffer any on a beat 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:33.979
 because suffering this beat can 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:36.080
 damage the fisherman to the oil pump and 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:37.370
 can also damage the engine roseli 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.740
 to shut down your participation 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:42.350
 here now I wanted you to respond 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.540
 if there is a question there, our viewer 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.880
 Juan Carlos sent a question to 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.830
 he is in the east zone of sÃ£o 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.300
 Paulo is a big brother and he is asking you 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.960
 It's also low for the 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:56.600
 tpi is wondering if it's like passing 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:59.570
 in a first-rate flood can 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.950
 or not the ideal is the 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.350
 next time you are 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.960
 passing in a flood and life ' avoiding 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:08.540
 change gear and then do not flood 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:12.290
 always noticed that the front car 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:14.930
 is below 6 wheel of water and you 

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:16.790
 engages a first gear and follows the 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.040
 course in the first gear without 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:21.710
 exactly if you change margin of 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.690
 suddenly see the volume of water behind the 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.570
 car because at the time you 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:28.040
 will open the volume of water that 

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:30.229
 volume of water if you change the 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.810
 gearbox may enter through the exhaust 

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:35.310
 car dies when a car dies 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:36.930
 absorbs the engine it admits this water 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.790
 where it happens, I fit 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.110
 Hydraulic is right Roseli I loved it 

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:41.910
 talk to you 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.830
 Thank you for your participation 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:46.230
 here and now the inertia left in this 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:48.090
 program pink friday 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:51.030
 I did not want to leave, man was my fan. 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:53.400
 Wrong page because it's my facebook is 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:56.100
 like roseli oliveira da silva and visit 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.620
 my fan page as a mechanical shovel're roseli 

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:01.250
 sure and roseli understands the mechanics of 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:04.640
 truth in the balela did not see in each zone 

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.640
 for you
