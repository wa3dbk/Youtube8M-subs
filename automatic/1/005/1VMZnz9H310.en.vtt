very<00:00:07.459> effective<00:00:08.029> and<00:00:08.269> complete<00:00:08.900> training

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:09.230 
very effective and complete training

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.590 
very effective and complete training
technique<00:00:09.740> to<00:00:10.160> stimulate<00:00:10.639> maximum<00:00:11.209> muscle

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:11.600 
technique to stimulate maximum muscle

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.539 
technique to stimulate maximum muscle
growth<00:00:11.780> but<00:00:12.289> it's<00:00:12.469> also<00:00:12.650> a<00:00:12.799> very<00:00:13.160> advanced

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:13.549 
growth but it's also a very advanced

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:35.090 
growth but it's also a very advanced
technique<00:00:14.150> not<00:00:14.330> for<00:00:14.600> everybody

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.890 

so<00:00:36.100> that<00:00:36.220> concludes<00:00:36.670> our<00:00:36.790> video<00:00:37.000> on<00:00:37.210> cluster

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
so that concludes our video on cluster

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.650 
so that concludes our video on cluster
training<00:00:38.380> one<00:00:39.250> final<00:00:39.640> word<00:00:39.820> of<00:00:39.940> advice<00:00:40.270> don't

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
training one final word of advice don't

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.140 
training one final word of advice don't
overdo<00:00:41.590> clusters<00:00:42.100> because<00:00:42.550> they're<00:00:42.970> it's

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.150 
overdo clusters because they're it's

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.500 
overdo clusters because they're it's
such<00:00:43.450> an<00:00:43.780> effective<00:00:44.820> powerful<00:00:45.820> method

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
such an effective powerful method

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.110 
such an effective powerful method
it's<00:00:47.080> very<00:00:47.410> also<00:00:47.650> very<00:00:47.980> stressful<00:00:48.580> on<00:00:48.790> both

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
it's very also very stressful on both

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.750 
it's very also very stressful on both
the<00:00:49.480> muscles<00:00:49.930> and<00:00:50.140> the<00:00:50.500> nervous<00:00:50.890> system<00:00:50.920> so

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
the muscles and the nervous system so

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.120 
the muscles and the nervous system so
it's<00:00:51.940> very<00:00:52.090> easy<00:00:52.480> to<00:00:52.780> do<00:00:52.930> too<00:00:53.170> much<00:00:53.410> because

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.130 
it's very easy to do too much because

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.790 
it's very easy to do too much because
all<00:00:54.730> athletes<00:00:55.180> especially<00:00:55.629> those<00:00:56.410> who<00:00:56.650> are

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
all athletes especially those who are

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.549 
all athletes especially those who are
buying<00:00:56.980> this<00:00:57.370> tape<00:00:57.640> want<00:00:58.330> to<00:00:58.510> improve<00:00:58.930> as<00:00:59.230> fast

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
buying this tape want to improve as fast

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.030 
buying this tape want to improve as fast
as<00:00:59.710> possible<00:01:00.250> but<00:01:01.210> by<00:01:01.629> trying<00:01:02.080> to<00:01:02.290> do<00:01:02.590> too<00:01:02.800> much

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
as possible but by trying to do too much

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.270 
as possible but by trying to do too much
too<00:01:03.370> soon<00:01:03.400> you're<00:01:04.330> actually<00:01:04.809> stopping<00:01:05.560> your

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
too soon you're actually stopping your

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.340 
too soon you're actually stopping your
progress<00:01:06.700> and<00:01:07.060> probably<00:01:07.630> even<00:01:07.869> you're<00:01:08.229> going

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
progress and probably even you're going

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.620 
progress and probably even you're going
to<00:01:08.410> regress<00:01:08.740> at<00:01:08.920> some<00:01:09.100> point<00:01:09.369> so<00:01:10.060> with<00:01:10.210> cluster

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
to regress at some point so with cluster

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.180 
to regress at some point so with cluster
training<00:01:11.020> what<00:01:11.200> you<00:01:11.320> want<00:01:11.500> to<00:01:11.619> do<00:01:11.770> is<00:01:11.950> do

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
training what you want to do is do

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.150 
training what you want to do is do
clusters<00:01:12.850> for<00:01:13.090> three<00:01:13.390> weeks<00:01:13.600> tops<00:01:13.960> then<00:01:14.770> three

weeks<00:01:15.340> of<00:01:15.640> regular<00:01:16.300> training<00:01:16.930> go<00:01:17.350> back<00:01:17.560> to

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
weeks of regular training go back to

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.590 
weeks of regular training go back to
cluster<00:01:18.100> for<00:01:18.280> three<00:01:18.460> weeks<00:01:18.640> and<00:01:18.910> back<00:01:19.450> and

in<00:01:35.619> a<00:01:35.680> cluster<00:01:36.100> form<00:01:36.340> because<00:01:36.850> you<00:01:36.940> don't<00:01:37.120> want

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
in a cluster form because you don't want

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.510 
in a cluster form because you don't want

so<00:01:40.960> remember<00:01:41.710> cluster<00:01:42.310> very<00:01:42.909> effective<00:01:43.420> very

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
so remember cluster very effective very

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.410 
so remember cluster very effective very
powerful<00:01:44.770> but<00:01:45.220> also<00:01:45.280> very<00:01:45.760> stressful<00:01:46.299> on<00:01:46.360> the

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
powerful but also very stressful on the

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.260 
powerful but also very stressful on the
body<00:01:46.540> so<00:01:46.870> you<00:01:46.990> don't<00:01:47.229> overdo<00:01:47.710> it<00:01:47.950> so<00:01:48.670> I<00:01:48.700> hope

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
body so you don't overdo it so I hope

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.359 
body so you don't overdo it so I hope
you<00:01:49.420> enjoyed<00:01:49.659> the<00:01:49.780> tape<00:01:49.990> and<00:01:50.229> hopefully<00:01:50.860> you

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
you enjoyed the tape and hopefully you

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.060 
you enjoyed the tape and hopefully you
enjoyed<00:01:51.729> it<00:01:51.850> as<00:01:51.970> enough<00:01:52.720> to<00:01:53.260> buy<00:01:53.409> the<00:01:53.470> next<00:01:53.770> one

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
enjoyed it as enough to buy the next one

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.880 
enjoyed it as enough to buy the next one
so<00:01:54.580> in<00:01:55.299> the<00:01:55.450> meantime<00:01:55.659> enjoy<00:01:56.229> your<00:01:56.380> training

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
so in the meantime enjoy your training

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:05.740 
so in the meantime enjoy your training
and<00:01:57.070> hopefully<00:01:57.430> enjoy<00:01:57.970> your<00:01:58.119> results

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.320 

well<00:02:06.290> most<00:02:06.680> people<00:02:07.070> will<00:02:07.280> associate<00:02:07.760> cluster

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
well most people will associate cluster

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.270 
well most people will associate cluster
training<00:02:08.720> with<00:02:08.930> Coach<00:02:09.350> Charles<00:02:09.650> Poliquin

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.730 
training with Coach Charles Poliquin
which<00:02:10.790> is<00:02:10.970> basically<00:02:11.420> true<00:02:11.750> because<00:02:12.080> he's<00:02:12.590> the

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
which is basically true because he's the

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.320 
which is basically true because he's the
one<00:02:12.770> who<00:02:13.010> popularized<00:02:13.400> this<00:02:14.090> training

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
one who popularized this training

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.450 
one who popularized this training
technique<00:02:14.900> however<00:02:15.590> this<00:02:16.040> is<00:02:16.160> a<00:02:16.190> training

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
technique however this is a training

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.570 
technique however this is a training
method<00:02:16.730> that<00:02:17.030> has<00:02:17.420> been<00:02:17.450> used<00:02:17.750> for<00:02:18.500> many<00:02:19.250> many

because as you might know in olympic
weightlifting<00:02:29.990> you<00:02:30.860> have<00:02:31.010> to<00:02:31.220> drop<00:02:31.490> the

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
weightlifting you have to drop the

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.970 
weightlifting you have to drop the
weight<00:02:31.850> after<00:02:32.180> each<00:02:32.570> repetition<00:02:32.900> because<00:02:33.560> you
