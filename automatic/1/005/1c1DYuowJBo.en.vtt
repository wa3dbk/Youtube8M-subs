 played against and of course many instruments as a mother with a special 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.330
 game for him that's called the radio play predicted to be great in the fifties 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:21.300
 people do 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.680
 where the safe was on the radio with all kinds of attributes to the sounds that 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.410
 could have supported a good story, but why shouldn't that be on television 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.140
 therefore a nicola has a whole cart full of all tribute 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.830
 a colleague of all sounds from last week to hear that game all that 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:37.650

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.740
 and jeroen van koningsbrugge and foreplay actor

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.400
 the fall of the wall 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.070
 this was 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.280
 the ladies coming in November 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.140
 in these ten 89 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.140
 X 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.850
 those are the people behind the violence 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.850
 not no at the moment 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.060
 the boys are just the wall 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.060
 of tree that is not downwards adjusted by the road 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.050
 he was on the list of cyclists 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.570
 but that went very well 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.370
 I know what I am doing I start with a small piece 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:32.870
 the last pillar 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.870
 and perhaps the latter better 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.850
 the falls occurred in Groningen 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.780
 according to the spool 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.870
 that is not the intention 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.040
 nadal 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.880
 a blissful dialogue 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.930
 a hole appeared on the other side of the wall on the roof 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.349
 Tuesday the little boy started that time 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.799

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:23.659
 it becomes an important role to give meaning to partner 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.219
 on the big market in breda 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:30.999

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:37.759
 an alarm clock 

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:42.359
 the Brabant newspaper 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:45.359
 and of course 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:55.159
 good plan because on the other side of the wall due to slippery 

00:02:57.869 --> 00:03:00.539
 wanted to interpret politics 

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:02.159

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.329
 where do you have an ap market for someone who was once seriously injured 

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:16.269

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:17.759
 every case 

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:20.759

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:45.119
 we expected every year 

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:46.190
 but fortunately 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.169
 wait a moment for large brazilian samba 

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:51.989
 she wants to share 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.989
 I say so myself 

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:07.939
 a special day 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:09.259
 in November 

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:12.259
 the wall had fallen with a huge blow 

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:23.509

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:27.729
