that is just like a Miss which I really

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.979 
that is just like a Miss which I really
like<00:02:36.239> it's<00:02:36.420> not<00:02:36.569> heavy<00:02:37.380> like<00:02:37.770> cream<00:02:38.870> but<00:02:39.870> it's

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
like it's not heavy like cream but it's

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.259 
like it's not heavy like cream but it's
not<00:02:40.110> exactly<00:02:40.410> an<00:02:40.530> aerosol<00:02:40.860> spray<00:02:40.920> so<00:02:41.700> it

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
not exactly an aerosol spray so it

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:43.130 
not exactly an aerosol spray so it
doesn't<00:02:42.540> get<00:02:42.599> too<00:02:42.780> sticky

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
doesn't get too sticky

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.320 
doesn't get too sticky
it<00:02:43.290> just<00:02:43.500> it's<00:02:43.680> very<00:02:43.739> light<00:02:44.160> so<00:02:44.730> I<00:02:44.790> definitely

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
it just it's very light so I definitely

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.559 
it just it's very light so I definitely
recommend<00:02:45.810> this<00:02:46.080> for<00:02:46.830> people<00:02:46.890> who<00:02:47.580> like<00:02:48.150> more
