spring water all the way across hydro

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.479 
spring water all the way across hydro
field<00:03:06.200> but<00:03:07.200> I<00:03:07.380> think<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.739> best<00:03:07.920> method<00:03:08.340> is<00:03:08.430> to

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
field but I think the best method is to

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.900 
field but I think the best method is to
stick<00:03:09.060> close<00:03:09.300> to<00:03:09.599> the<00:03:10.010> edge<00:03:11.010> of<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.310> cliff<00:03:11.610> and

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
stick close to the edge of the cliff and

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.850 
stick close to the edge of the cliff and
the<00:03:11.940> enemies<00:03:12.780> attend<00:03:13.170> to<00:03:13.290> leave<00:03:13.470> you<00:03:13.590> pretty

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
the enemies attend to leave you pretty

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.790 
the enemies attend to leave you pretty
much<00:03:13.920> alone<00:03:17.420> so<00:03:18.420> just<00:03:19.140> do<00:03:19.260> that<00:03:19.410> and<00:03:19.650> when<00:03:19.770> you

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
much alone so just do that and when you

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.070 
much alone so just do that and when you
get<00:03:20.040> to<00:03:20.220> them<00:03:20.480> throughout<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:21.600> spring<00:03:21.810> water

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
get to them throughout the spring water

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.980 
get to them throughout the spring water
and<00:03:22.319> you'll<00:03:22.530> be<00:03:22.650> happy
