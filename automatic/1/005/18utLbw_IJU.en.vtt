 Well then, the first day of Golden Week 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.160
 Last time I left 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.130

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:19.940
 It is part of this side 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:22.370
 The binding agent in this part 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:26.450
 I want to paste 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:32.669
 I It is that this is that Bash 9 patterns do 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:38.000

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:45.660
 Open hole next to that is not in this kind of wind eh in 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:51.220
 It was going to be a field from there 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:55.320
 It seems that the line in the temple was cut off 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:01:00.150
 The upper part is good 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.020
 I ca n't get a finger, but this is soldered and attached to the wire and soldered and recovered 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:07.360
 I guess I do 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:12.560
 Is I'd noted so well is to cut this kind of accident work 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:15.700
 After all how many Lamban's wearing is good not to vomit something that doesn't fall too much 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.789
 After all you 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:23.560
 Well shin This is binding water d its good 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:24.980
 To say that the teacher recruitment scrub with sandpaper to say 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.620
 It looks like 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:33.520

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.460
 To open the place 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:42.149
 I Hippagasu you after you really saying, I'm good with padding 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.670
 It takes nice 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.890
 In there 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.320
 yeah 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:53.040
 It is to build-up going to put something adhesive tax of resin 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:02:01.340
 In and backer Toka painted after 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:01.340
 It is Well and juniper lacquer in-white and then painted lacquer from now 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.280
 Another technique that I think is quite good work 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.970
 Conspicuous crack and Kawaa 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.970
 I have not come out 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:23.040
 Well if this 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:29.390
 I wonder if there was something worth doing 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.390
 Well I think sweat Come on with it 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:37.060
 Kim saw the guitar complete with this 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:43.590
 Already 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:51.220
 I think that there is no more than this 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:57.519
 8 Actually, the guitar I ordered for the direct cause of import of the line Giza has arrived 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:59.120
 I well sound great but I thought try kana and remodeling the guitar is loose this 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:05.440
 so 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.440
 Tears were stopped Kayosou to have a Tsu good man about leaving 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.850
 Day it 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:15.270
 I thought I'd do this say why in such 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:18.430
 I'm a telecaster of the Li morning fleet 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.260
 It is from looking at the mud 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.250
 How 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.250
 It is a custom shop 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:34.850
 That's why you think that such a guitar remodeling car is not good 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:38.220
 I already stopped remodeling and this is an acrylic body, but this is actually that 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.230
 It also seems to be an aluminum body 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:44.819
 The day 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:49.170
 I was told that I came back with one set of two bottles , so I came back with one set of two bottles 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:52.920
 Also I quit remodeling but I was supposed to remodel the person of another one 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:57.450
 It has not been opened , but it has been sent as it is 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:04:01.290

 By the way, the sender is a Texas best brother 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:17.230
 It seems that I have an electronic construction, but I do not know well whether it is possible there or not 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:20.519
 Is it completely from another company? 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:24.800
