00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
yeah I'm saying because studies have

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.230 
yeah I'm saying because studies have
shown<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.799> then<00:01:47.130> studies<00:01:47.729> don't<00:01:47.880> need<00:01:48.119> the

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
shown and then studies don't need the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.139 
shown and then studies don't need the
show<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.720> prove<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.079> point<00:01:49.259> but<00:01:50.009> studies<00:01:51.000> have

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
show to prove the point but studies have

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.700 
show to prove the point but studies have
shown<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.570> can<00:01:51.659> read<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.229> I'm<00:01:52.350> not<00:01:52.560> going

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
shown that you can read it I'm not going

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.300 
shown that you can read it I'm not going
to<00:01:53.000> cite<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.210> studies<00:01:54.570> right<00:01:55.350> here<00:01:55.649> but<00:01:55.890> that

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
to cite the studies right here but that

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.569 
to cite the studies right here but that
there<00:01:56.579> is<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.930> 13%<00:01:57.930> increase<00:01:58.079> in<00:01:58.890> power<00:01:59.100> or

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
there is a 13% increase in power or

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.719 
there is a 13% increase in power or
strength<00:01:59.960> depending<00:02:00.960> on<00:02:01.049> what<00:02:01.229> study<00:02:01.439> you

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
strength depending on what study you

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.270 
strength depending on what study you
read<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:03.000> how<00:02:03.119> they<00:02:03.500> use<00:02:04.500> their<00:02:04.649> terminology

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
read and how they use their terminology

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.089 
read and how they use their terminology
but<00:02:05.610> there's<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.880> 13%<00:02:06.540> increase<00:02:07.079> in<00:02:07.799> strength

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
but there's a 13% increase in strength

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.949 
but there's a 13% increase in strength
or<00:02:08.310> power<00:02:08.569> when<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:10.229> vocalize<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.959> stress

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
or power when you vocalize the stress

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.940 
or power when you vocalize the stress
okay

okay

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.170 
okay

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
so basically you're getting some

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.600 
so basically you're getting some
adrenaline<00:02:15.540> from<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.710> grunts<00:02:17.100> you're

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
adrenaline from the grunts you're

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.059 
adrenaline from the grunts you're
increasing<00:02:17.940> your<00:02:18.150> aggression<00:02:19.069> increasing

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
increasing your aggression increasing

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.610

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
confidence which is a huge thing

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.850
