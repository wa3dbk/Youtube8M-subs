00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.120
 but a brastemp refrigerator I already have 

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:07.430
 a video showing what the defect is 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.010
 so you do not have to change the part nor 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:13.160
 too much ice information in the air duct 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.380
 It is between the refrigerator and freezer oo 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.910
 stop the circulation, I've already put it in 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.980
 the screws here where I put the 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.180
 freezer advisors filled the four 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.180
 by afonso is stronger 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.760
 the product looks only at the different training 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:31.460
 normal of that gaucho 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.890
 then you this ethanol formation this 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.749
 shape even with time 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.819
 when they entered they directed the resistance 

00:00:35.749 --> 00:00:40.129
 will ice and then always 

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:41.749
 when someone asks for a refrigerator defect 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.489
 which is not revealing I ask for April 

00:00:41.749 --> 00:00:45.649
 highlight and see how the training is 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.089
 directed this normal that such information 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.620
 is wrong here 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:51.709
 I do not know if you'll get there. 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:55.699
 below but look inside the fault of the 

00:00:51.709 --> 00:01:00.109
 zaga has the same huge say in the background 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:02.539
 I do not know is visible and managed 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:05.270
 I do not know how you 're going to stay in the flu. 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:09.050
 in the bottom of the gutter has a block of ice 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:13.900
 maybe even give you a feeling about 10 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.900
 descending and this block of ice passes 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.410
 a time in the refrigerator department and 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.300
 here inside 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.950
 I need air rate reaches inside 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.620
 of the ice rate 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.410
 and look at the training feature 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:33.410
 ice within that world situation 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.090
 creating on time in the refrigerator either 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.240
 say the refugee is hot here 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.090
 inside the favela, nothing else is hot and 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.740
 inside of the full ice that happens 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.220
 you get a glass of ice water and 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.290
 places a warm environment one second 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.000
 The outside of the body is full of 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.560
 water droplet formation 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.050
 molecules of hydrogen and oxygen that 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.960
 was joined there and forms the same case 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.990
 refrigerator as the refrigerator is cheese 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.760
 Frozen ceiling and the inner part there are 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.260
 this formation of water droplets are 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.430
 here the instruction per client the same 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.749
 cool thing because they are br 47v happens 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.280
 much with this model 

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:11.770
 so what happens when you turn off the product 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.870
 is so human at least 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.050
 38 goal leaves both doors open not 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:20.230
 I recommend starting 72 hours and knowing to 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.820
 where the dtg inside will dry this 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.710
 waterlogged part and these 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.770
 droplets of water on the ceiling 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.060
 extension of the dodo and 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.450
 chilled are these drops filled 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.920
 They mediated the time all behavior 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.170
 full of water 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.440
 You will dry this water on the ceiling and 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.840
 leave the refrigerator open for 48 years 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.000
 you will still have been dried to 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.170
 so the water is because it has no magic 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.870
 in the duct 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.420
 there you can realize the product that he 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.100
 re-operates in all cases of 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.620
 refrigerator that stops already on the bottom 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:57.670
 it's going to be hard on the pib but on these models 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.670
 here it happens very well and me 47b it is 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.870
 master for this then change the piece 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.180
 charged by lincoln business will not 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.220
 not only works for the euro in the case 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.060
 of instruction for him time served 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.070
 turns off and on again after 72 hours 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.690
 has no internal majority and how the 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.280
 Do you know that by drying the 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.280
 new staff informatics
