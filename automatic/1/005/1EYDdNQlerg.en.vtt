00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
falling out and at first I didn't think

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.679 
falling out and at first I didn't think
too<00:00:29.160> much<00:00:29.189> about<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.699> because<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.150> just<00:00:30.300> thought

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
too much about it because I just thought

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.350 
too much about it because I just thought
to<00:00:30.750> myself<00:00:30.900> well<00:00:31.439> maybe<00:00:31.650> it's<00:00:31.920> just<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.550> phase

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
to myself well maybe it's just a phase

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.569 
to myself well maybe it's just a phase
my<00:00:33.719> hair's<00:00:33.960> going<00:00:34.230> through<00:00:34.559> until<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.280> went<00:00:35.489> to

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
my hair's going through until I went to

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.639 
my hair's going through until I went to
visit<00:00:35.790> my<00:00:35.969> parents<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.809> my<00:00:37.079> mom<00:00:37.350> actually

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
visit my parents and my mom actually

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.250 
visit my parents and my mom actually
commented<00:00:38.370> she<00:00:38.760> asked<00:00:38.940> me<00:00:39.120> if<00:00:39.360> my<00:00:39.989> hair<00:00:40.230> was

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
commented she asked me if my hair was

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.549 
commented she asked me if my hair was
thinner<00:00:40.770> or<00:00:41.160> if<00:00:41.610> my<00:00:42.510> hair<00:00:42.840> was<00:00:42.870> falling<00:00:43.290> out

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
thinner or if my hair was falling out

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.010 
thinner or if my hair was falling out
more<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.010> so<00:00:44.730> her<00:00:44.969> comment<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.480> definitely

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
more and so her comment is definitely

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.049 
more and so her comment is definitely
what<00:00:46.289> boosted<00:00:46.770> me<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.160> do<00:00:47.370> something<00:00:47.879> about

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
what boosted me to do something about

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.319 
what boosted me to do something about
this<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:49.710> thought<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.370> could<00:00:50.700> be<00:00:50.730> one<00:00:51.210> of

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
this and I thought it could be one of

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.569 
this and I thought it could be one of
two<00:00:51.360> things<00:00:51.590> at<00:00:52.590> first<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:53.070> thought<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.309> could

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
two things at first I thought it could

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.880 
two things at first I thought it could
be<00:00:53.610> because<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.480> only<00:00:54.660> wash<00:00:54.960> my<00:00:55.170> hair<00:00:55.350> every

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
be because I only wash my hair every

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.979 
be because I only wash my hair every
three<00:00:56.430> or<00:00:56.460> even<00:00:56.730> four<00:00:57.030> days<00:00:57.510> sometimes

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
three or even four days sometimes

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.610 
three or even four days sometimes
because<00:00:58.640> every<00:00:59.640> blog<00:01:00.090> every<00:01:00.660> Beauty<00:01:01.079> magazine

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
because every blog every Beauty magazine

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.709 
because every blog every Beauty magazine
you<00:01:02.070> know<00:01:02.280> people<00:01:02.640> on<00:01:02.730> YouTube<00:01:03.120> say<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.510> you

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
you know people on YouTube say that you

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.130

should wash your hair as little as
comfortably<00:01:07.680> possible<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.580> my<00:01:09.060> hair<00:01:09.299> doesn't

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
comfortably possible and my hair doesn't

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.230 
comfortably possible and my hair doesn't
really<00:01:09.750> get<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.110> oily<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.580> can<00:01:11.820> go<00:01:11.970> for

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
really get that oily so I can go for

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.550 
really get that oily so I can go for
days<00:01:12.270> just<00:01:12.689> fine<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.049> my<00:01:13.140> hair<00:01:13.290> looks<00:01:13.320> really

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
days just fine and my hair looks really

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.859 
days just fine and my hair looks really
pretty<00:01:13.920> until<00:01:14.340> like<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:14.760> n<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.570> fourth

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
pretty until like that n to the fourth

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.249 
pretty until like that n to the fourth
day<00:01:16.110> so<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.500> wash<00:01:16.740> my<00:01:16.950> hair<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.369> then<00:01:18.210> um<00:01:18.780> I

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
day so I wash my hair and then um I

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.590 
day so I wash my hair and then um I
thought<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.860> might<00:01:20.159> be<00:01:20.400> because<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:21.150> shampoos

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
thought it might be because the shampoos

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.330 
thought it might be because the shampoos
i'm<00:01:21.810> using<00:01:22.170> might<00:01:22.439> have<00:01:22.650> sulfites<00:01:23.130> in<00:01:23.280> them

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
i'm using might have sulfites in them

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.429 
i'm using might have sulfites in them
and<00:01:23.670> these<00:01:24.150> are<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.450> shampoos<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:24.900> i<00:01:25.140> was

wanted to try out a salon brand name so

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.590 
wanted to try out a salon brand name so
that's<00:01:44.040> why<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.250> ended<00:01:44.369> up<00:01:44.579> purchasing<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:45.270> at

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
that's why I ended up purchasing this at

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.420 
that's why I ended up purchasing this at
the<00:01:45.960> time<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.200> didn't<00:01:46.740> even<00:01:46.799> look<00:01:47.070> at<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.310> head

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
the time I didn't even look at the head

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.340 
the time I didn't even look at the head
sulfates<00:01:47.909> because<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.210> assumed<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.810> didn't<00:01:49.170> it

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
sulfates because I assumed it didn't it

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.499 
sulfates because I assumed it didn't it
most<00:01:49.829> definitely<00:01:49.950> does<00:01:50.549> have<00:01:50.759> sulfates<00:01:51.299> and

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
most definitely does have sulfates and

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.440 
most definitely does have sulfates and
so<00:01:52.320> what<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:52.829> decided<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.399> do<00:01:53.579> was<00:01:53.790> go<00:01:54.030> out<00:01:54.060> and

so what I decided to do was go out and

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.120 
so what I decided to do was go out and
try<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.689> find<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.170> Shampoo<00:01:55.470> without<00:01:55.560> sulfates
