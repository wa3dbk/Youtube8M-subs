00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:08.549
 [Music] 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.990
 so we start creating a greenhouse 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.760
 bioclimatic 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.410
 so in fact the principle of this greenhouse 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.449
 sceqe have made a hole of one meter in 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.919
 the earth which allows us to keep the 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.650
 temperature of the earth that is gradually 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:23.970
 close to 15 degrees continuously so in 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.189
 winter it will hold all who will 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.990
 the interior to the freeze is in is and will be 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.829
 tend to refresh a little bit at 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.829
 share john lasserre 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.989
 so here we put straw in the bottom 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.550
 of the greenhouse that will allow us to actually 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.890
 walk the days over the earth is 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.649
 wet on the waist rather lost the bou 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.570
 its nice lawn and there we see so 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:48.699
 the southern part to make a series 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.589
 very quickly - and that's right 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:51.610
 southern sun 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:01:15.929
 and so here we go up the walls in 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:01:15.929
 Straw at once face sonar have 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:23.429
 a true pure sun is a hostile 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.429
 and well push the tongue when he 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.220
 will allow the first details of his 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:37.080
 front logo paquita merz not that the 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.080
 land of the fund was not due 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:46.220
 [Music] 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.830
 so we put pegs in fact to 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.270
 hold the waist if ever big shots 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:02:03.289
 wind idea is that the straw does 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:02:05.270
 does not collapse what are we here we have 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.159
 made straw partitions so north 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.250
 to prevent the cold air from the winds 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.319
 cold m north in the greenhouse to note 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:16.370
 also the west wall is completely 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:18.769
 in straw the southern facade in green so that 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.540
 it's past the southern sun and we've 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.519
 ended with two entries to the east which will 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.130
 also in glass that will allow a small 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:46.130
 little in the morning sun to get into 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:48.620
 the earth and then here is the job 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:52.100
 we therefore define the bioclimatic greenhouse 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.870
 we made them the straw walls 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.260
 that cheaper material than we could have 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:01.400
 find easy to install we have recovered 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.590
 window dumpster village so 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.470
 it's all in recovery 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.730
 here we go we start on the sides this 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.120
 which does not seem to actually cultivate 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.799
 on purpose inside the greenhouse side 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.840
 south we put a little pond in front 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.370
 in fact what will allow the sun down 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.980
 will be treated in the pond and 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.540
 return more easily to the greenhouse and 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.690
 in the summer when the beautiful dresses to know 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.690
 made 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.729
 [Applause] 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:45.840
 easily 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:45.840
