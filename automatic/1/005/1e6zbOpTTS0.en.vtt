00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.540
 in the seasonal changes we have a 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.769
 the condition for which the body is 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.769
 must readjust to 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.040
 a condition is above all different 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:24.100
 of different light for which the axis 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:27.310
 hypothalamus pituitary and pineal gland 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.080
 melatonin production must register 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.450
 on these new changes that are 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.890
 to happen so often 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.550
 no symptoms such as 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.860
 fatigue nervousness insomnia and also 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:43.870
 a discount for which we can request 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:45.940
 help in the squares let's say that flat 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.620
 ideal with regard to insomnia 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.870
 season changes valerian la 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.790
 valerian that is often used in the 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.870
 complexes together with hawthorn 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:58.110
 Passiflora is important in reconciling 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:02.980
 sleep then in those dreams 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:06.610
 initial since it has a capacity of 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.800
 increase the number of receptors â‚¬ 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.229
 for a specific neurotransmitter that 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.850
 it is called galla present inside the 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.880
 then our central nervous system 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.560
 acts as another neuro sedative plant 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.350
 fundamental plant especially in the 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.860
 zone changes of season in scotland 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.350
 in this case, however, fundamentally us 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.810
 we have neither dream with awakenings therefore 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.659
 the central part of sleep that is a lot 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.240
 more suitable for a plant just like 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:37.420
 Scotland which always has a neuro action 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.460
 we have selective but also muscle relaxant 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.979
 spoken before the other hawthorn 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.020
 fundamental plants has an effect 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.700
 mostly I am heart 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.789
 but I do not find a cardiotonic positive 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.289
 but also an action regarding 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:51.210
 the central nervous system is therefore a 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:53.759
 anxiolytic and important in changes of 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.909
 season in the nervousness of change of 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.299
 season or we have plants that don't 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.829
 can be defined as 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:06.439
 antidepressants but which do not lead 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.439
 energy then reduce in a manner 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:12.390
 circumstantial depression because 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.420
 increase energy such as ginseng 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.090
 panax ginseng which is fundamental plant 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.120
 of coming from the east in this 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.200
 case from not only important to ours 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.880
 emotions but from a condition of 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.800
 recovery of stenia that together with 5 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.510
 biloba to fundamental transplantation 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.680
 especially in memory because in i 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.349
 seasonal changes can be abolished 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.200
 reduced is essential point together 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:42.680
 ginseng with 5 biloba to recover it e 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.129
 have a recovery condition 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.000
 or until you get plants 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:48.590
 antidepressants par excellence because 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.220
 are plants adopted gene such as the 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.819
 rhodiola or hypericum 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.680
 hypericum is important 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.390
 an important planted repression of 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.870
 which, however, must be taken into account 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:03.239
 ability to inhibit cytochrome p450 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:06.060
 so watch out for drugs that 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.950
 we use why use hypericum 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.409
 together with other drugs means ad 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.859
 expose yourself to the side effects of 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:15.859
 drugs because they do not come to be 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.859
 metabolized
