00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:13.490
 hello there is a so-called us 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.490
 one 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:19.960
 because aboard was not given and until 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:23.210
 so far if the wave over many talked 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.140
 what design is about 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.490
 closer to the topic 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.850
 going by itself was svapnut us 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.480
 quite a long time ago 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.789
 he's over a year ago 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:40.140
 put a v-eight stepfather was 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:43.680
 made a video which by the way scored 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:49.070
 a lot of views on y tube all 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.070
 Thank you all who looked here 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:55.580
 the machine is still in use 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.370
 owning some changes even he 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.410
 introduced there brakes changed exhaust 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.879
 I digested my make a quiet exhaust he 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:07.650
 pass digest on right exact 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:09.840
 now he came to the installation 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.640
 transparent transmission gives and 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.020
 grand hiace 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.370
 actually that was on 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.520
 made 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.530
 on her day off 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.760
 how much is she here is not the degree rowan of 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.970
 bridge automat 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.560
 separately 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.250
 and in the pond promval 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.910
 all made 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.910
 cargo 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.120
 third 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.270
 handing out fixed on 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:39.450
 and modernized stretcher 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.610
 on the basis of the regular subframe redone 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.160
 driveshafts they no longer have 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.170
 spline connection directly 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.510
 the middle of the cardan spline belt 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.070
 connection in the transfer box itself 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:55.820
 which is much more practical and convenient 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:59.330
 as you remember from the original video 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:02.400
 video review during acceleration 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.620
 was like a plane on some kind 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:09.679
 fighter of fighter sound 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:16.290
 It is from the handout from her shaft gives 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:17.569
 noisy gears so check the running 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.830
 qualities 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.730
 car to yourself 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.370
 now 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.860
 quietly ride around the city 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.670
 not even 5 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.580
 a machine 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.120
 what wave 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.120
 normal speakers 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:42.390
 powertrain before its owner is not 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.640
 heard since there was noise 4 6 what 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.610
 engine carburetor box 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.800
 it turned out that there is no noise 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.370
 We did not decide and have accordingly 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.710
 it's pretty quiet anyway now 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:00.180
 If the noise is preserved because 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:05.810
 big wheels on the car cost but from 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.810
 razdatki already sly we are not any places 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.040
 we are now 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.900
 my whistle 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.430
 quite 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.700
 cooked 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.060
 I didnâ€™t like the owner 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.360
 improve what managed 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.360
 we don't 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.659
 well plus and sit down on your own understand 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.470
 sable and remains the front axle of all 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:45.190
 anchor 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.650
 archaic construction do not forget what 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.130
 him Kazan 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.090
 knock there 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.090
 made crosses 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.069
 turn up 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.489
 on yourself know what to put in a good way 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:02.950
 front axle from a foreign car. there 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:05.349
 gives about what he is there that 5 kruzak to take 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.740
 continuous bridge but in order to 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:10.800
 put need to hold 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:12.690
 big enough engineering work like 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.730
 and installation and steering 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.340
 management is likely to principle and 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:21.000
 make a bipod 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:24.090
 you understand it just cut it out 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.330
 the tree does not work that is just 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.950
 weld from there world more metals it 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.969
 still quite responsibly and 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:36.829
 so the whole task 

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:36.829
 left to owners 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.740
 those who are not indifferent, that is, many 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.740
 wrote when we put 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.640
 asked to make a video 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.130
 for work 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.190
 from the delight of the pirates 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.190
 the medicine
