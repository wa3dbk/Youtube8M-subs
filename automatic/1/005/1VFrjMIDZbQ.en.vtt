here is the state that it's currently at
so<00:01:24.439> it's<00:01:25.439> not<00:01:25.619> finished<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:26.280> doesn't<00:01:26.700> mean

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
so it's not finished it doesn't mean

the character and this time we might
even<00:01:56.070> go<00:01:56.250> further<00:01:56.520> or<00:01:57.030> at<00:01:57.659> least<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.930> was<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.110> plan

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
even go further or at least I was a plan

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.120 
even go further or at least I was a plan
the<00:01:59.040> origin<00:01:59.340> plan<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.670> this<00:01:59.820> tutorial<00:02:00.329> series

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
the origin plan of this tutorial series

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.649 
the origin plan of this tutorial series
to<00:02:02.130> not<00:02:02.280> only<00:02:02.490> make<00:02:02.820> an<00:02:02.969> amazing<00:02:03.420> character

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
to not only make an amazing character

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.080 
to not only make an amazing character
way<00:02:04.020> better<00:02:04.229> than<00:02:04.560> last<00:02:04.799> time<00:02:04.950> but<00:02:05.670> also<00:02:05.880> to

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
way better than last time but also to

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.199 
way better than last time but also to
you<00:02:06.780> know<00:02:06.869> really<00:02:07.079> make<00:02:07.200> it

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
you know really make it

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.500 
you know really make it
animate<00:02:09.209> like<00:02:10.200> an<00:02:10.470> email<00:02:10.770> table<00:02:11.310> so<00:02:12.239> that<00:02:12.270> you

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
animate like an email table so that you

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.940 
animate like an email table so that you
can<00:02:12.780> really<00:02:12.959> make<00:02:13.020> a<00:02:13.170> movie<00:02:13.470> out<00:02:13.560> of<00:02:13.590> it

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
can really make a movie out of it

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.640 
can really make a movie out of it
I<00:02:13.980> want<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.030> take<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.300> through<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:16.110> whole

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
I want to take you through the whole

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.750 
I want to take you through the whole
process<00:02:16.709> of<00:02:17.640> doing<00:02:17.910> it<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:19.220> so<00:02:20.220> texturing<00:02:20.640> is

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
process of doing it and so texturing is

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.850 
process of doing it and so texturing is
also<00:02:21.030> part<00:02:21.270> of<00:02:21.390> it<00:02:21.569> you<00:02:22.110> know<00:02:22.170> I<00:02:22.290> have<00:02:22.319> here<00:02:22.680> a

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
also part of it you know I have here a

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.510 
also part of it you know I have here a
bit<00:02:23.220> of<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.459> demonstration<00:02:24.050> ignore<00:02:25.050> those<00:02:25.520> a

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
bit of a demonstration ignore those a

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.640 
bit of a demonstration ignore those a
couple<00:02:27.480> of<00:02:29.330> flat<00:02:30.330> shaded<00:02:30.720> materials<00:02:31.200> here<00:02:31.470> I

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
couple of flat shaded materials here I

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.500 
couple of flat shaded materials here I
just<00:02:33.950> that<00:02:34.950> was<00:02:35.069> the<00:02:35.190> wrong<00:02:35.310> material<00:02:35.730> anyways

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
just that was the wrong material anyways

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.300 
just that was the wrong material anyways
I<00:02:36.540> just<00:02:36.840> changed<00:02:37.680> that<00:02:37.830> because<00:02:38.010> it<00:02:38.280> looks

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
I just changed that because it looks

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.720 
I just changed that because it looks
cool<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:38.959> I'm<00:02:39.959> shaded<00:02:40.350> mode<00:02:40.500> no<00:02:41.069> it's<00:02:41.340> kind<00:02:41.640> of

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
cool and I'm shaded mode no it's kind of

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.350 
cool and I'm shaded mode no it's kind of
gray<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.209> you<00:02:42.360> have<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:42.660> chase<00:02:43.459> never<00:02:44.459> mind

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
gray and you have to chase never mind

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.020 
gray and you have to chase never mind
so<00:02:46.350> we're<00:02:46.560> also<00:02:46.739> doing<00:02:47.010> texturing<00:02:47.610> and<00:02:47.819> that's

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
so we're also doing texturing and that's

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.890 
so we're also doing texturing and that's
the<00:02:48.180> point<00:02:48.360> that<00:02:48.590> rigging<00:02:49.590> hopefully<00:02:50.310> and<00:02:50.900> see

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
the point that rigging hopefully and see

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.550 
the point that rigging hopefully and see
what<00:02:52.110> else<00:02:52.319> we<00:02:52.440> can<00:02:52.680> do<00:02:52.830> now<00:02:53.480> last<00:02:54.480> kind<00:02:55.290> of<00:02:55.410> the

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
what else we can do now last kind of the

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.229 
what else we can do now last kind of the
only<00:02:55.890> thing<00:02:56.190> that<00:02:56.340> I<00:02:56.370> want<00:02:56.549> to<00:02:56.670> prepare<00:02:57.060> you

already recorded six hours of video and
it's<00:03:05.580> it<00:03:06.120> reached<00:03:06.390> almost<00:03:06.630> 30<00:03:07.080> parts<00:03:08.120> it's

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
it's it reached almost 30 parts it's

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.740 
it's it reached almost 30 parts it's
really<00:03:11.480> without<00:03:12.480> any<00:03:12.540> time<00:03:14.750> acceleration
