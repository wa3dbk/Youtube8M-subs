the previous video so make sure to check
that<00:00:23.310> idea<00:00:23.640> isn't<00:00:23.730> hiding<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.119> knife<00:00:24.240> lunge<00:00:24.420> but

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
that idea isn't hiding a knife lunge but

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.450 
that idea isn't hiding a knife lunge but
I<00:00:25.230> just<00:00:25.470> want<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:25.710> on<00:00:25.830> top<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:26.039> this<00:00:26.189> railing

I just want you on top of this railing

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.849 
I just want you on top of this railing
and<00:00:26.670> go<00:00:26.789> prone<00:00:27.199> you<00:00:28.199> can<00:00:28.380> also<00:00:28.529> go<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.740> the

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
and go prone you can also go to the

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.220 
and go prone you can also go to the
railing<00:00:29.099> on<00:00:29.369> that's<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.660> left<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:31.109> me<00:00:31.170> but

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
railing on that's to the left of me but

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.420 
railing on that's to the left of me but
that's<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.590> lot<00:00:31.710> harder<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:32.070> don't<00:00:32.219> do<00:00:32.340> without

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
that's a lot harder you don't do without

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.850 
that's a lot harder you don't do without
dying<00:00:32.759> so<00:00:33.120> this<00:00:33.660> was<00:00:33.840> just<00:00:33.870> an<00:00:34.079> easier<00:00:34.350> way<00:00:34.469> but

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
dying so this was just an easier way but

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.139 
dying so this was just an easier way but
then<00:00:34.950> eventually<00:00:35.070> just<00:00:35.399> want<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.670> once<00:00:36.000> you're

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
then eventually just want to once you're

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.639 
then eventually just want to once you're
on<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.570> you'll<00:00:36.660> prone<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.440> want<00:00:37.590> to

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
on this and you'll prone you want to

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.220 
on this and you'll prone you want to
keep<00:00:37.710> edging<00:00:38.040> your<00:00:38.160> way<00:00:38.219> back<00:00:38.460> so<00:00:39.090> um<00:00:39.270> because

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
keep edging your way back so um because

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.690 
keep edging your way back so um because
like<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.530> can't<00:00:40.860> stand<00:00:41.010> up<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.250> do<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:41.520> or

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
like you can't stand up to do this or

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.740 
like you can't stand up to do this or
you'll<00:00:41.820> die<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.239> have<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.390> just<00:00:42.510> keep<00:00:42.629> you

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
you'll die so you have to just keep you

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.360 
you'll die so you have to just keep you

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
out of edging way over to this railing

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.490 
out of edging way over to this railing
right<00:00:44.610> here<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.030> once<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:45.989> get<00:00:46.140> writing

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
right here and once you get writing

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.660 
right here and once you get writing
about<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.770> spot<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.100> just<00:00:47.219> wanna<00:00:47.340> stand<00:00:47.520> up

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.189 
quickly and go back to prawns you don't
die<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.620> then<00:00:50.219> we<00:00:51.030> want<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.239> hold<00:00:51.420> sprint<00:00:51.780> jump

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
die and then we want to hold sprint jump

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.779 
die and then we want to hold sprint jump
and<00:00:52.469> run<00:00:52.680> across<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.129> bar<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.309> do<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.520> strafe

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
and run across that bar and do a strafe

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.310

jump<00:00:53.820> onto<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.270> top<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.719> speed<00:00:54.930> cold<00:00:55.140> roof

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
jump onto the top of the speed cold roof

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.750 
jump onto the top of the speed cold roof
now<00:00:55.890> there's<00:00:56.070> no<00:00:56.160> death<00:00:56.370> bearing<00:00:56.610> on<00:00:56.670> this

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
now there's no death bearing on this

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.490 
now there's no death bearing on this
roof<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.600> will<00:00:57.719> be<00:00:57.809> ok<00:00:58.079> if<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.230> stay<00:00:58.469> right

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
I've done correctly you'll hit the edge

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.780 
I've done correctly you'll hit the edge
of<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.860> building<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.310> you'll<00:01:14.430> be<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:14.670> this

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
of the building and you'll be in this

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.539 
of the building and you'll be in this
like<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:16.200> bill<00:01:16.380> boxing<00:01:16.950> right<00:01:17.070> here<00:01:17.220> now

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
like this bill boxing right here now

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.130 
like this bill boxing right here now
you're<00:01:17.850> inside<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:18.479> zombies<00:01:18.810> can't<00:01:19.020> hit

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
you're inside of it so zombies can't hit

the railing right where Andrew is or
where<00:01:24.689> Bob<00:01:24.990> Korea's<00:01:25.409> but<00:01:26.100> it's<00:01:26.490> pretty<00:01:26.670> good

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
where Bob Korea's but it's pretty good

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.520 
where Bob Korea's but it's pretty good
glitch<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.270> there's<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.659> lot<00:01:27.750> more<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:28.110> explore

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
glitch and there's a lot more to explore

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.429 
glitch and there's a lot more to explore
from<00:01:28.950> here<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.280> can<00:01:29.310> jump<00:01:29.670> over<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.180> side

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
from here you can jump over to the side

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:33.140 
from here you can jump over to the side
I'll<00:01:31.439> show<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:31.680> in<00:01:31.920> about<00:01:32.430> 20<00:01:32.850> seconds

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
I'll show that in about 20 seconds

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.520 
I'll show that in about 20 seconds
there's<00:01:33.329> like<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.479> little<00:01:33.570> edging<00:01:33.960> on<00:01:34.140> top<00:01:34.350> of

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
there's like a little edging on top of

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.929 
there's like a little edging on top of
and<00:01:34.770> then<00:01:35.189> from<00:01:35.340> here<00:01:35.400> pretty<00:01:35.670> much<00:01:35.729> the

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
and then from here pretty much the

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.240 
and then from here pretty much the
opportunities<00:01:36.930> are<00:01:37.020> endless<00:01:37.079> for<00:01:37.619> new<00:01:37.950> spots

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
opportunities are endless for new spots

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.580 
opportunities are endless for new spots
and<00:01:38.430> barriers<00:01:38.729> you<00:01:38.850> going<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.090> top<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.420> as<00:01:39.590> on

was<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:01.979> weird<00:02:02.369> design<00:02:02.700> map<00:02:02.939> but<00:02:03.719> they<00:02:03.810> actually

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
was a weird design map but they actually

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.249 
was a weird design map but they actually
attracted<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.070> pretty<00:02:05.700> good<00:02:05.969> they<00:02:06.659> did<00:02:06.719> how<00:02:07.200> to
