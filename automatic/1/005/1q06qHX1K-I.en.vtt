00:00:04.312 --> 00:00:06.855
 Let's say that the heart failure of the patient reaches a moment, 

00:00:06.855 --> 00:00:09.292
 when medicines and lifestyle changes help, 

00:00:09.292 --> 00:00:10.980
 but they are simply not enough. 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.548
 And the patient is symptomatic almost all the time. 

00:00:14.018 --> 00:00:15.201
 Then we begin to think about 

00:00:15.201 --> 00:00:17.704
 implantation of a medical device or surgery. 

00:00:18.394 --> 00:00:20.128
 There are several types of medical devices, 

00:00:20.128 --> 00:00:21.376
 which can be used. 

00:00:21.603 --> 00:00:24.836
 The first we call a heart- 

00:00:24.842 --> 00:00:27.611
 or just VAD, VAD. 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.517
 This device assists the ventricles 

00:00:31.517 --> 00:00:32.986
 of the patient. 

00:00:33.282 --> 00:00:34.896
 Once in heart failure one or both ventricles 

00:00:34.896 --> 00:00:36.608
 do not pump very well, 

00:00:36.637 --> 00:00:38.589
 these devices help with that 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:41.589
 and replace the ventricle by pumping. 

00:00:42.163 --> 00:00:43.162
 They have a small hose, 

00:00:43.162 --> 00:00:45.124
 which is attached to the ventricle, 

00:00:45.124 --> 00:00:47.830
 who needs help. 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:48.757
 Let's say that in this case 

00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:50.493
 the left ventricle needs help. 

00:00:50.615 --> 00:00:53.446
 The blood comes from the lower part of the ventricle, here. 

00:00:53.738 --> 00:00:55.259
 At this point, 

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:56.838
 instead of coming out of the artery, 

00:00:56.838 --> 00:01:00.965
 as it is normally expected to do, it's kind of redirected. 

00:01:03.385 --> 00:01:06.747
 It goes through this hose to this separate pump. 

00:01:07.202 --> 00:01:09.422
 VAD then pumps it through the next tube, 

00:01:09.422 --> 00:01:12.551
 which connects it to the artery, and then goes out of the heart. 

00:01:13.602 --> 00:01:15.348
 We kind of circumvent this whole area 

00:01:15.948 --> 00:01:18.547
 and let VAD do all the pumping work. 

00:01:19.353 --> 00:01:22.151
 VAD devices are usually associated with a small control device, 

00:01:22.151 --> 00:01:24.101
 which is actually outside the body. 

00:01:24.101 --> 00:01:26.951
 One is connected to VAD and comes out of the interior 

00:01:27.073 --> 00:01:29.061
 through a small hole in the abdomen 

00:01:29.061 --> 00:01:31.007
 to a control device which is outside, 

00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:33.209
 and is connected to several batteries. 

00:01:33.412 --> 00:01:35.095
 Both of these are usually worn 

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:37.284
 with straps across the body. 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.040
 I drew this for the left ventricle 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.588
 and we usually call this left VAD or LVAD. 

00:01:44.035 --> 00:01:46.943
 But there may well be a device for the right ventricle, 

00:01:47.192 --> 00:01:49.868
 as we call it RVAD, or right VAD. 

00:01:50.791 --> 00:01:53.015
 They are usually connected to the right atrium, 

00:01:53.015 --> 00:01:54.487
 Bring blood to the pump 

00:01:54.487 --> 00:01:56.807
 and return it to the right side of the artery, 

00:01:56.807 --> 00:01:58.680
 which is directed to the lungs. 

00:01:59.615 --> 00:02:00.857
 We can even have BIVAD, 

00:02:00.857 --> 00:02:03.405
 which means there is a pump for each ventricle. 

00:02:04.757 --> 00:02:06.754
 Depending on the VAD device, it can pump blood, 

00:02:06.754 --> 00:02:09.767
 just as the heart does, rhythmically. 

00:02:09.854 --> 00:02:12.880
 But it may be a constant flow of blood. 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.188
 In this case there is no pumping pumping 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.913
 and may not have a normal pulse, 

00:02:16.913 --> 00:02:19.821
 but the body gets the blood it needs. 

00:02:20.453 --> 00:02:23.019
 VAD implants are usually reserved either for people who 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:24.888
 waiting for heart transplantation, 

00:02:24.888 --> 00:02:26.653
 or as a long-term solution 

00:02:26.653 --> 00:02:29.747
 for those who can not receive the heart transplant. 

00:02:33.618 --> 00:02:35.475
 The other type of medical implant 

00:02:35.475 --> 00:02:38.501
 is called Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy. 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.543
 This can only be a pacemaker 

00:02:40.543 --> 00:02:44.503
 or it may be a special double pacemaker and defibrillator. 

00:02:44.694 --> 00:02:46.888
 In the pacemaker a small device 

00:02:46.888 --> 00:02:48.577
 is implanted in the chest. 

00:02:48.815 --> 00:02:50.255
 These electric wires, 

00:02:50.255 --> 00:02:52.867
 sometimes we call it drives, go from the device 

00:02:52.867 --> 00:02:55.787
 and to the left and right ventricles. 

00:02:56.094 --> 00:02:57.011
 But notice that 

00:02:57.011 --> 00:03:00.169
 to reach the left ventricle, 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:02.316
 they must pass through the coronary veins 

00:03:02.316 --> 00:03:04.526
 and pass by the heart 

00:03:04.526 --> 00:03:07.199
 to the outside of the left ventricle. 

00:03:07.494 --> 00:03:09.190
 That's why I drew this with broken lines, 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.657
 as it passes from behind. 

00:03:12.173 --> 00:03:13.787
 We know that in heart failure the right one 

00:03:13.787 --> 00:03:16.175
 and the left ventricle can be damaged differently. 

00:03:16.818 --> 00:03:19.854
 And, ultimately, beat at different times 

00:03:19.854 --> 00:03:22.640
 and this greatly reduces the efficiency of pumping the heart. 

00:03:23.168 --> 00:03:26.476
 The pacemaker sends signals down these wires or leads, 

00:03:26.476 --> 00:03:28.554
 at the same time to tell the two ventricles 

00:03:28.554 --> 00:03:30.337
 to beat at the same time, 

00:03:30.551 --> 00:03:34.023
 which leads to more normal and efficient pumping. 

00:03:34.951 --> 00:03:36.255
 This device may also come with this, 

00:03:36.255 --> 00:03:38.138
 called defibrillator. 

00:03:38.446 --> 00:03:39.472
 If the patient's heart failure 

00:03:39.472 --> 00:03:41.642
 leads to life-threatening accelerated heart rhythm, 

00:03:41.642 --> 00:03:44.741
 which is uncontrollably quick, 

00:03:44.741 --> 00:03:46.410
 the device may be shocked, 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.422
 which, one kind, restarts the heart to normal rhythm. 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.212
 But besides medical implants, 

00:03:53.212 --> 00:03:55.923
 surgery can also be performed. 

00:03:56.688 --> 00:03:59.493
 In coronary-arterial disease, stents may be placed which 

00:03:59.493 --> 00:04:01.438
 to help the bloodstream. 

00:04:02.187 --> 00:04:04.091
 They are placed in the areas of the arteries, 

00:04:04.091 --> 00:04:05.658
 who have plaque buildup, 

00:04:05.867 --> 00:04:08.363
 which helps to enlarge the arteries and makes it easier 

00:04:08.363 --> 00:04:09.982
 the flow of blood through them. 

00:04:10.186 --> 00:04:13.094
 And then, his heart is easier to pump through them. 

00:04:14.342 --> 00:04:17.796
 Another operation is called coronary-arterial bypass surgery. 

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:20.344
 This surgical technique 

00:04:20.344 --> 00:04:22.526
 redirects blood circulation 

00:04:22.526 --> 00:04:24.741
 around the blocked artery. 

00:04:25.101 --> 00:04:27.276
 Again, as with a stent, it becomes much easier 

00:04:27.276 --> 00:04:28.911
 to be pumped through this artery, 

00:04:28.911 --> 00:04:30.474
 which is no longer blocked. 

00:04:31.025 --> 00:04:34.229
 Typically, the doctor connects, or sometimes says, a graft, 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:35.912
 a healthy artery from another place on the body, 

00:04:35.912 --> 00:04:39.378
 where its lack is not a big problem. 

00:04:40.544 --> 00:04:41.485
 Finally, the last one 

00:04:41.485 --> 00:04:43.563
 Surgical Intervention is 

00:04:43.563 --> 00:04:45.717
 complete heart transplantation. 

00:04:46.258 --> 00:04:48.837
 With her, the whole heart of the patient is removed 

00:04:48.847 --> 00:04:51.341
 and replaced with a healthy donor heart. 

00:04:51.521 --> 00:04:54.142
 This procedure is reserved for patients, 

00:04:54.142 --> 00:04:56.791
 who are in the last stage of heart failure 

00:04:56.791 --> 00:05:00.466
 or when other surgical treatments have failed.
