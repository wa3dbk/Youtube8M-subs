00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
what it originally looked like it has a

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.840 
what it originally looked like it has a
little<00:01:26.610> bit<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:26.970> discoloring<00:01:28.310> but<00:01:29.310> then<00:01:29.610> on

more<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:03.370> tighter<00:03:03.700> your<00:03:04.060> lines<00:03:04.450> will<00:03:04.750> be<00:03:04.780> so<00:03:05.260> I

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
more the tighter your lines will be so I

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.250 
more the tighter your lines will be so I
I<00:03:05.530> prefer<00:03:06.099> a<00:03:06.129> q-tip<00:03:06.700> tried<00:03:07.540> it<00:03:07.689> several<00:03:07.870> times

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
I prefer a q-tip tried it several times

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.020 
I prefer a q-tip tried it several times
on<00:03:08.439> different<00:03:08.500> knives<00:03:09.189> and<00:03:09.400> that<00:03:09.519> seems<00:03:09.760> to<00:03:09.879> be

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
on different knives and that seems to be

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.690 
on different knives and that seems to be
the<00:03:10.150> best<00:03:10.470> and<00:03:11.470> then<00:03:12.010> you<00:03:12.099> want<00:03:12.280> to<00:03:12.340> let<00:03:12.519> that

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
the best and then you want to let that

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.259 
the best and then you want to let that
sit<00:03:13.209> for<00:03:13.859> really<00:03:14.859> however<00:03:15.250> long<00:03:15.519> you<00:03:15.730> want<00:03:15.760> I

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
sit for really however long you want I

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.420 
sit for really however long you want I
let<00:03:16.720> this<00:03:16.900> sit<00:03:17.139> for<00:03:17.169> another<00:03:17.409> 40<00:03:17.979> minutes<00:03:18.310> and

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
let this sit for another 40 minutes and

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.360 
let this sit for another 40 minutes and
it<00:03:18.519> turned<00:03:18.729> out<00:03:18.849> like<00:03:19.000> this<00:03:19.409> but<00:03:20.409> just<00:03:21.159> so<00:03:21.250> you

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
it turned out like this but just so you

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.550 
it turned out like this but just so you
know<00:03:21.400> when<00:03:21.669> we<00:03:22.000> look<00:03:22.709> darker<00:03:23.790> then<00:03:25.560> it

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
know when we look darker then it

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.449 
know when we look darker then it
actually<00:03:26.829> is<00:03:27.430> when<00:03:27.879> you<00:03:28.030> wash<00:03:28.419> everything<00:03:28.659> off

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
actually is when you wash everything off

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.140 
actually is when you wash everything off
so<00:03:30.459> if<00:03:31.359> you<00:03:31.659> want<00:03:32.049> it<00:03:32.229> really<00:03:32.470> dark<00:03:33.280> make<00:03:33.879> sure

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
so if you want it really dark make sure

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.830 
so if you want it really dark make sure
it<00:03:34.510> looks<00:03:34.889> really<00:03:35.889> dark<00:03:36.299> before<00:03:37.299> you<00:03:37.419> wash<00:03:37.629> it

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
it looks really dark before you wash it

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.420 
it looks really dark before you wash it
off<00:03:37.959> and<00:03:38.199> then<00:03:38.319> I<00:03:38.349> just<00:03:38.620> took<00:03:38.829> it<00:03:38.889> into<00:03:39.129> the

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
off and then I just took it into the

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.559 
off and then I just took it into the
kitchen<00:03:40.290> ran<00:03:41.290> it<00:03:41.500> under<00:03:41.739> hot<00:03:41.919> water<00:03:41.979> and<00:03:42.569> wiped

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
kitchen ran it under hot water and wiped

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:47.640 
kitchen ran it under hot water and wiped
it<00:03:43.780> off<00:03:44.049> with<00:03:44.500> a<00:03:44.709> very<00:03:45.220> soft<00:03:45.699> sponge<00:03:46.239> and<00:03:46.810> so

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
it off with a very soft sponge and so

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.780 
it off with a very soft sponge and so
and<00:03:47.949> this<00:03:48.790> was<00:03:49.239> the<00:03:49.659> product<00:03:49.900> so<00:03:50.319> I<00:03:50.349> went<00:03:50.790> from

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
and this was the product so I went from

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:58.830 
and this was the product so I went from
this<00:03:52.440> to<00:03:54.810> this<00:03:56.159> in<00:03:57.159> roughly<00:03:57.970> two<00:03:58.150> hours<00:03:58.569> and

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
this to this in roughly two hours and

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.770 
this to this in roughly two hours and
it's<00:03:59.379> great<00:03:59.650> I<00:03:59.919> mean<00:04:00.459> not<00:04:00.729> only<00:04:00.760> is<00:04:01.120> it

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
it's great I mean not only is it

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.890 
it's great I mean not only is it
aesthetically<00:04:02.620> appealing<00:04:03.329> appealing<00:04:04.329> but<00:04:04.599> it

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
aesthetically appealing appealing but it

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.990 
aesthetically appealing appealing but it
will<00:04:05.699> it<00:04:06.699> will<00:04:06.849> protect<00:04:07.090> the<00:04:07.569> blade<00:04:07.930> and

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
will it will protect the blade and

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.399 
will it will protect the blade and
that's<00:04:10.000> really<00:04:10.359> what<00:04:10.509> I<00:04:10.540> wanted<00:04:10.930> I<00:04:11.079> wanted

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:11.409 
that's really what I wanted I wanted

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:13.229 
that's really what I wanted I wanted
something<00:04:11.590> that<00:04:11.889> I<00:04:11.919> didn't<00:04:12.250> have<00:04:12.549> to<00:04:12.879> worry

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
something that I didn't have to worry

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.960 
something that I didn't have to worry
about<00:04:13.329> oiling<00:04:14.079> all<00:04:14.259> the<00:04:14.439> time<00:04:14.650> although<00:04:15.489> I<00:04:15.819> do

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
about oiling all the time although I do

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.409 
about oiling all the time although I do
keep<00:04:16.449> it<00:04:16.570> oiled<00:04:17.639> but<00:04:18.639> something<00:04:19.000> that<00:04:19.030> I<00:04:19.239> could

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
keep it oiled but something that I could

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:20.150 
keep it oiled but something that I could
let

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
let

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.920
