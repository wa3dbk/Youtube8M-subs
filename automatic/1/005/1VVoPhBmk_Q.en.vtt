00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.119 

I<00:04:33.699> always<00:04:34.449> say<00:04:34.870> that's<00:04:35.199> probably<00:04:35.530> part<00:04:36.039> of<00:04:36.069> the

00:04:36.119 --> 00:04:36.129 
I always say that's probably part of the

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:41.159 
I always say that's probably part of the
braking<00:04:36.430> system<00:04:36.789> there<00:04:39.479> maybe<00:04:40.479> that<00:04:40.810> power

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
braking system there maybe that power

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:51.900 
braking system there maybe that power
brake<00:04:41.530> booster

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.380 

and<00:04:52.450> the<00:04:53.380> hood<00:04:53.680> has<00:04:53.950> a<00:04:53.980> really<00:04:54.580> nice<00:04:54.730> under

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390 
and the hood has a really nice under

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:18.600 
and the hood has a really nice under
hood<00:04:55.570> pad<00:04:56.400> which<00:04:57.400> we'll<00:04:57.640> see<00:04:57.880> in<00:04:57.910> a<00:04:58.060> minute

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.939 

there<00:05:19.240> you<00:05:19.419> can<00:05:19.479> see<00:05:19.599> it's<00:05:19.900> kept<00:05:20.259> in<00:05:20.379> place<00:05:20.680> by

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:20.949 
there you can see it's kept in place by

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:26.959 
there you can see it's kept in place by
those<00:05:21.159> rods<00:05:21.629> extending<00:05:22.650> along<00:05:23.650> each<00:05:24.129> side

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:26.969 

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:34.050 

helps<00:05:27.969> keep<00:05:28.419> the<00:05:30.330> car<00:05:31.330> very<00:05:31.599> quiet
