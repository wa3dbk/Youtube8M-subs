00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.389
 pop 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:12.099
 Melville's knee 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:13.040
 so to say 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.289
 this is considered a stronghold on the scales 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.960
 we are a sworn community of extreme sports amateurs who are not 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.960
 so send a quirk cool down 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.530
 end up 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.530
 500 points had climbed 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.540
 preliminary climax of the group of Prof 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.340
 Mark Walder 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.400
 the consequences 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.859
 what has been set down on it 

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:43.260
 and developed among other things have fun 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.670
 "We also significantly lower well over 30 but also people to Central 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.500
 Market and 13 14 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.040
 yes, everybody likes to come in her mouth 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.610
 This applies only if I stop in things and 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.570
 one understands each other very well as well as with a good cohesion 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.160
 us 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.400
 Unfortunately we do not give in Germany but do not last sunshine 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.720
 but we will definitely see you 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.890
 that the pot is pretty much Marcel Philipp 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.750
 even in the simple shelter 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.159
 Brüggemann wants to be put under the ravens 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.050
 It is also not important enough protected 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.660
 Ratan Tata Steel theme by »had Brawn start says Joachim Herrmann there 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.660
 then I can not say more 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.110
 we have stop 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.290
 Project days allowed 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.680
 yes, at this time, you have everything that you planned and we have 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.220
 made different designs 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.950
 subsequently were distributed well over the day 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.690
 advised and coordinated 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.690
 it will certainly be narrower 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.400
 27 iMac be made 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.160
 be active of the right Said Fred 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.260
 the adults 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.970
 the EMO's appearances in business intelligence and not against 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:58.280
 you 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.510
 Mr only way become serious and are and for the environment in the 17 and that they 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.510
 personally I always think so easily 

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:21.519
 Giving space also to AZ to feel comfortable giving the teens 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.949
 I think that is completely exaggerated the concern support their one-third 

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:27.069
 on 1 4 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.069
 that will improve 

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:35.539
 So on the first day had to stop 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:38.919
 Florian Feichtner 

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:40.179
 unloaded 

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:41.249
 and then 

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:46.279
 First, everything from bow all the earth foundation cast concrete mistakes were 

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:50.930
 the main job was basically building that in during the one and a half 

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:53.159
 Weeks but really every day here 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:56.159
 he works but has bad luck because the progress seen 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:57.759
 yes at that time already 

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:59.579
 relatively many buyers 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.369
 make you happier than planned 

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:03.989
 Fischer said 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.399
 to do so 

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:08.769
 everything in individual work 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.769
 Concrete slabs used Porsche needs 

00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:15.779
 So I'm right that hearing help yourself 

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:19.759
 Apollon that other people would do it because they do not and we appreciate 

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:22.759
 that users even more if we did that ourselves 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:26.469
 he needs to be kind to fellowship to take care of everything 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:28.069
 welds 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.149
 What would you rather be up to that on other people that is no use 

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:33.329
 hold 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.740
 I find it particularly important that the young people were involved 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.130
 Both have realized that their own work is what they do 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.790
 have built and I assume that I also very well 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.699
 in the future for this 

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:51.119
 that we notice that the city of Hannover fixed back and made me important 

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:53.569
 that one time he finally sees something changed
