00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
here it should be straight forward from

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.289 
here it should be straight forward from
now<00:01:31.039> the<00:01:31.520> whole<00:01:31.640> procedure<00:01:32.000> should<00:01:32.240> take

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
now the whole procedure should take

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.809 
now the whole procedure should take
under<00:01:32.840> two<00:01:33.049> minutes<00:01:33.399> go<00:01:34.399> ahead<00:01:34.610> and<00:01:34.700> proceed
