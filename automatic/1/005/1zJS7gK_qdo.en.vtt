00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:11.920
 I'm sorry I want to talk about the cloud a little this time 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:13.630
 Even if it is called cloud, it's a little game so it's a bit of a game so it 's a useful retrospective of the cloud 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.170
 I think I want to tell 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:18.270
 I think that you are familiar with the recent games, but especially for smartphones 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.560
 It's a game 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:27.780
 It is Brave frontier that there is a puzzle 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.650
 the fact that the cloud is and also twitter smartphone game Aiu of of of easy to say 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:35.010
 that 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:37.050
 It's a service company , and it 's a player's ally to the server of the company that provided it. 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.260
 The word has been reprinted 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.390
 What if to do so 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.199
 It is place that it is convenient, but this is screen of desktop computer of Uzu 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.240
 is not it 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:47.850
 Here in the open now 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.260
 Steam's 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.030
 It is an app 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:58.769
 So there are a couple of places here and there, but the game is different 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.879
 Has been installed in the personal computer First, the people of the PC out to such Fu softening 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:06.330
 If there is a plastic bull 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:09.250
 When it is broken or you suddenly have to go with it or a PC or something, when you buy a new PC 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:14.080
 If you also have government data have been saved game data to 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:18.940
 Must have a memory chip or card in the current radish pack up 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:24.370
 All the play data will disappear but the recent game 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:25.210
 Putin's Teamman's Team Saver saves the player's saved data. 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.110
 Because it is 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.620
 No matter if you buy another PC or something different 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:35.409
 I can take over with the play content 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:40.899
 Even if the PC breaks into a hit ball, it is delicious 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:45.579
 It will be the brother-in-law to leave the save data in the great cloud of that is also Film otherwise 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:50.320
 I like drugs now I'm doing diablo Diablo 3 is also very convenient 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:55.180
 Of software that this company offers in addition to Diablo 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.530
 It is an application that can not be totally managed day by day, but put this in the game 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.460
 If you install it 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:04.620
 For example, Ue-san, here in the window of the guy here 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:08.530
 I'm always doing diablo iii and sync my account etc. 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:10.220
 There is a mechanism that you can play the game 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:15.020
 Here is the screen of mac 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:19.040
 There is Diablo in the black too . This is the gear in this application. 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:24.680
 Application Tteyuu earlier and with the bad Runetto 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:30.210
 Select the play Then here also in this account Edo size is as in play 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:35.319
 It is also the clay you were macbook the same screen is hey Eko a while ago 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:40.540
 It becomes a specification that says that it is a state that data is taken over without change 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:45.819
 If you put government data in the cloud like game software 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:52.450
 You do not have to worry about government data type Chau Once you have installed on your PC or Mac 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:55.310
 Speaking in terms of comfort, I'm on the go with a little high-performance machine 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:03:00.990
 When you say business trip and want to kill time 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:06.600
 A and Rutteyuu that the continuation of the game play, you can now with a laptop 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:10.320
 It is a system like a dream really for people who really like riffs . 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:15.870
 It's time to see the movie in real life 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:17.870
 After Toka playing in your outside a school and not a good TV back to home game 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.100
 I can not do it 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.540
 Now 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:26.720
 Jaiko also has a game with 3ds ds and I am doing pico pico pico pico 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.370
 I think I understand the old world of Uz-san 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.569
 NES generation of people 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.810
 Pretty game gathered everyone went to the house of riding NES it is between friends in Surutto 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.790
 Say 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.630
 I miss you 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:44.190
 It will shift to talk a little with me not I, but 3 of the tea now 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:47.730
 Is very merit of Tteyuu to manage the save data in the cloud today in the fact that 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:51.390
 I was kindly informed that it was expensive and the current game was 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:55.080
 It is also a story that it becomes such a specification 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:59.620
 It really says cloud and external the case for dropbox Toka Sky Drive 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:01.680
 It is a service that stores the data, but lie this game over 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.700
 I was told in the story of 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:11.549
 If there is an opportunity, such as evernote tokan pro box 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:16.859
 Similar dad generation and especially hit's in the very useful in the cloud service 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:21.269
 I think that people in the photo say something but I use this cloud service and with my daughter 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.670
 Because the photograph of the son is very efficient and can be stored, the story is also 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.040
 of 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:29.850
 Today I felt like I wanted to do something about 1 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:36.450
 But it's just a side note to another video 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:38.150
 The cloud service is pretty much like showing it to others and sharing it with others 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.500
 Than 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.800
 Do a little suspicious photos Take care 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.800
 Ssu
