00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 in this opportunity we have reached an 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.680
 4 min and you do not want to turn on anymore 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.400
 we check the battery has a voltage 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:13.459
 Stable higher than 3.7 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.219
 when we analyze in the source of 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:17.680
 food we can notice that it has a 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.610
 short between the ends as already 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.160
 customarily we have said it in the 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:25.340
 channel that means that between the track 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.789
 positive and negative there is continuity what 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.529
 which will never turn on the phone the 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.239
 phone we will connect to the source 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.600
 and not just let us upload a 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.640
 1.6 to a volt voltage which is 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.190
 very little to know what area is going to 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.830
 heat one of the methods that we can 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.540
 use is to connect the charger though 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.869
 there is not much that will show us 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.780
 but if we can connect the charger and 

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:52.489
 analyze what area is already heated with 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.100
 this the charger this area on this side 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.930
 the one that gets hotter and that's why when 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.500
 we uncover it 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.600
 we concentrated to review that area but 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.699
 is that also as we explained in 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.590
 the channel we disconnect all the 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.080
 peripherals so that if any of them 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.910
 it's so short, we can know how we do 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.700
 the same measurement and disconnect everything 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:19.119
 sensor cameras leds and still short 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:23.900
 between the positive and the negative then 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:26.810
 when we uncover the guard we analyze 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.450
 and in more detail here I can 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.880
 analyze something quickly the phone to 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.970
 suffer moisture from the phone brings us a 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:39.670
 colleague because he was installing it the 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:43.850
 software did not finish well and the phone 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.830
 after watching the phone and in 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.500
 short between the negative positive this is 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.200
 it must to that as when installing the software 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.540
 and having the battery had high voltage 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.160
 which some capacitors will 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.170
 burned by this humidity that is here 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.090
 here and humidity there we see how is your 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.880
 missed and on the phone we can 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:06.010
 analyze or in the voice for this sector 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.870
 we also see sulphate and for this also 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.600
 this capacitor to have here has 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:13.000
 continuity to ground 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.010
 continue lands that on both sides we 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.860
 gives continuity to the negative part only 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.620
 It should be one but this one already removed it and 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.230
 It's still short but when I arrived here it's 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.450
 that another capacitor that is here in 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.580
 this part of above that is also 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.910
 land on both sides 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:34.300
 then that yes will give us solution 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.520
 because it is the one that is generating the short 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.610
 to all the work remember what they 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.470
 I explained in the course of c3 and c4 by 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.900
 example these capacitors that are in 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.930
 the line once battery of the line 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.740
 positive direct battery that 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.240
 They can be 26-28 circuits or components 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.860
 that can make the water that in 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:59.590
 short here we can quickly analyze 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.300
 she the short one left no longer has short and 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:06.390
 the phone should no longer turn on 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.390
 let's see if yes yes it is correct 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.680
 besides the phone turning on already gives us 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:24.020
 an error there of being warrant invites 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.630
 kernel that is already a software error 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.750
 so it did not end well in his 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:32.090
 deflation process of hoisting the the rom 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.940
 then here it is only to go back to throwing 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.720
 to the software and already the phone on 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.640
