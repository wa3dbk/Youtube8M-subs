 [Music] 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.970
 Monday you go with the range of the but 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.470
 what do you expect from it 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.340
 I know I'm expecting now too 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.120
 expect a very heavy one 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.830
 training camp 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.540
 I'm going to do my best I'm going to show myself 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.840
 and I also tried the trainer 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.130
 convince of my qualities and yes 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.900
 it is a far more difficult to hull 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.950
 had to be a frame to enjoy too 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.860
 how they all want to play 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.120
 Well describe a player that you like 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.600
 know his job is 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:05.090
 defender who always once a 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.410
 task that is very concentrated 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.640
 so I just told that to you 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.260
 myself he you 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.210
 he is the one from minute 1 to minute 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.130
 93 concentrated in itself between god and 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.950
 never caught one 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.930
 at a moment of from sagging 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.610
 and besides that, tasks are what I already have 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.890
 say performs technically tactically well 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.390
 physically grounded is still a huge must 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.830
 his steps into it are still growing 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.750
 must make but that won't be to him 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.459
 looks he wo n't wash his own top 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.720
 he will always get it 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.310
 later way you go home is a 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.380
