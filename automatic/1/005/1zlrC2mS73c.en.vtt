it<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:27.289> absolutely<00:01:28.289> essential<00:01:28.470> well<00:01:29.310> knowing

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
it is absolutely essential well knowing

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.419 
it is absolutely essential well knowing
that<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:30.450> lot<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.200> 3d<00:01:31.590> production<00:01:31.830> now<00:01:32.130> is<00:01:32.280> going

00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:32.429 
that a lot of 3d production now is going

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:34.300 
that a lot of 3d production now is going
to<00:01:32.549> be<00:01:32.610> going<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.450> stereoscopic<00:01:33.899> route

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
to be going the stereoscopic route

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.260 
to be going the stereoscopic route
having<00:01:35.840> the<00:01:36.840> new<00:01:36.960> stereoscopic<00:01:37.679> camera<00:01:37.950> rig

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
having the new stereoscopic camera rig

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.559 
having the new stereoscopic camera rig
right<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.539> built<00:01:40.470> in<00:01:40.649> natively<00:01:41.240> is<00:01:42.240> really

00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:42.569 
right and built in natively is really

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:44.899 
right and built in natively is really
exciting<00:01:43.039> that<00:01:44.039> you<00:01:44.159> can<00:01:44.310> adjust<00:01:44.399> inter

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
exciting that you can adjust inter

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.109 
exciting that you can adjust inter
ocular<00:01:45.060> distance<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.080> a<00:01:46.950> convergence<00:01:47.789> point

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
ocular distance and a convergence point

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.760 
ocular distance and a convergence point
all<00:01:48.929> dynamically<00:01:50.240> it's<00:01:51.240> gonna<00:01:51.990> speed<00:01:52.289> up<00:01:52.319> that

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
all dynamically it's gonna speed up that

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.600 
all dynamically it's gonna speed up that
preview<00:01:53.190> process<00:01:53.670> as<00:01:53.880> well

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.090 

well<00:01:58.180> I<00:01:58.210> think<00:01:58.480> all<00:01:58.570> these<00:01:58.720> improvements<00:01:59.100> let

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
well I think all these improvements let

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.920 
well I think all these improvements let
a<00:02:00.130> small<00:02:00.550> house<00:02:00.730> dream<00:02:01.060> big<00:02:01.330> and<00:02:01.630> we<00:02:01.750> don't

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
a small house dream big and we don't

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.680 
a small house dream big and we don't
have<00:02:02.200> to<00:02:02.380> say<00:02:02.530> no<00:02:02.740> to<00:02:02.800> certain<00:02:03.100> things<00:02:03.400> anymore

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
have to say no to certain things anymore

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.450 
have to say no to certain things anymore
in<00:02:04.900> fact<00:02:05.170> we<00:02:05.320> could<00:02:05.470> surpass<00:02:05.890> them<00:02:06.160> in<00:02:06.250> some

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
in fact we could surpass them in some

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.060 
in fact we could surpass them in some
ways<00:02:06.700> again<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.390> linear<00:02:07.660> color<00:02:08.259> workspace<00:02:08.830> is

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
ways again the linear color workspace is

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.160 
ways again the linear color workspace is
one<00:02:09.310> way<00:02:09.490> where<00:02:09.759> we<00:02:10.030> can<00:02:10.180> really<00:02:10.750> sweeten<00:02:11.020> our

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
one way where we can really sweeten our

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.910 
one way where we can really sweeten our
images<00:02:11.620> to<00:02:11.920> a<00:02:12.130> super-high-end<00:02:13.060> level<00:02:13.570> I<00:02:13.630> think

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
images to a super-high-end level I think

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.130 
images to a super-high-end level I think
the<00:02:14.920> data<00:02:15.100> interchange<00:02:15.430> is<00:02:16.060> already<00:02:16.750> part<00:02:17.020> of

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
the data interchange is already part of

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.750 
the data interchange is already part of
our<00:02:17.230> workflow<00:02:17.620> and<00:02:17.950> is<00:02:18.070> only<00:02:18.310> going<00:02:18.400> to<00:02:18.640> be

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
our workflow and is only going to be

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.170 
our workflow and is only going to be
more<00:02:18.940> so<00:02:19.240> and<00:02:19.510> again<00:02:20.470> lets<00:02:21.160> us<00:02:21.310> not<00:02:21.850> have<00:02:22.060> to

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
more so and again lets us not have to

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.360 
more so and again lets us not have to
turn<00:02:22.330> down<00:02:22.390> anything<00:02:22.960> if<00:02:23.800> it<00:02:23.950> wasn't<00:02:24.250> for

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
turn down anything if it wasn't for

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.850 
turn down anything if it wasn't for
light<00:02:24.520> wave<00:02:24.730> I<00:02:25.060> think<00:02:25.330> my<00:02:26.110> career<00:02:26.410> path<00:02:26.680> would

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
light wave I think my career path would

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.730 
light wave I think my career path would
be<00:02:26.920> very<00:02:27.520> different<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:28.600> fact<00:02:28.870> that<00:02:28.960> a<00:02:29.110> lot<00:02:29.590> of

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
be very different the fact that a lot of

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.620 
be very different the fact that a lot of
these<00:02:29.830> things<00:02:30.100> are<00:02:30.280> accessible<00:02:30.790> to<00:02:30.820> someone

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
these things are accessible to someone
