00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:09.000
 hello my name is 5 c 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.059
 Today 's tip is a quick tip but 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.089
 very important is about metadata and it 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.570
 is part of the article metadados no light 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.859
 15 posted there in the photo tips 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.930
 brasil.com.br for those who do not 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.240
 accompanied this is the third video of the 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.160
 series about lighting the first over 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.590
 catalogs the second is about importing 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.109
 photos and now about the metadata that are 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.809
 very important things in haiti 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.219
 so here's an explanation why 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.160
 serves the metadata or the metadata 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.180
 to serve you put information 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.920
 your photo 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.920
 if you, for example, do a job for 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.870
 a person for a customer delivers these 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.850
 photos for her to publish on the 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.180
 facebook on instagram in several places 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.350
 and not necessarily give you the credits 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.270
 and when we work with the customer 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.949
 We can not put a watermark on you. 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.270
 It's very good to think so, but if I 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.350
 to redial water then is not 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.789
 subject to it 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.469
 in fact you are always subject to 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.280
 this but from the moment you 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.930
 places the data within the required photo 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.350
 Do not you rather decrease that 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.369
 risk because because google indexes and 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.979
 it requires end 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.170
 so if you, for example, put yourselves 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.840
 within its metadata the copyright of the 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.610
 your photo your client publishes and you 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.520
 do a google search this photo will go 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.979
 appear to be yours then I think a 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.030
 extremely important and very important 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.799
 simple to use 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.530
 so come on, I can create it 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.490
 preserve yourself with these methods 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.259
 huh 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.979
 I actually create a basic crib 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.540
 here with my name is my body right 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.950
 Simple things that I will leave ready 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.509
 for every time I gave input 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.310
 My Photos in Haiti in every time 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.310
 I was able to import photos into Haiti I can 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.259
 apply this preset and all photos 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.229
 automatically assemble with this data 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.820
 that's when I want them to have it clear that 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.409
 can change you can create several 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.009
 different processes for reasons 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.560
 many different 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.820
 you can have more of the kind of work and 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.490
 things like that 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.909
 but I'll create a basics here and you 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.369
 You can also apply photo by photo 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:10.379
 I prefer to apply in the entrance but you 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.510
 You can also apply here a 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.930
 example is how you import your 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.269
 photos on light on 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.969
 faith is the visualization you will have and 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:21.430
 here you will get it here 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:23.650
 metadata here then 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.090
 it shows you know the 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.109
 metadata of this photo here that is 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.590
 selected 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:31.359
 This photo is pictures of exercises done. 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.250
 in the same photo shop you are 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:37.389
 photos were taken by an Ana student 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:41.340
 paula tatiana that already brings the dimension of 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:44.319
 photo is not saying she was guilty 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:48.569
 which is a guilty machine that she is 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:54.010
 using the time that happens on the radio 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:56.560
 the exposure is seeing the aperture iso no 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.599
 use the flash is a canoe 40 channel of either 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.659
 say the formal data I wish you too 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.500
 has an article on the site there is really cool 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:05.859
 you can see there 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.629
 so here what I'm going to do here I 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:11.439
 can i just bookmark this photo? 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:13.060
 create here for example the creator of the photo 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:15.219
 is not that in the case of ana paula to vote 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.650
 here is copyright as if it were mine 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:19.180
 but it's just to exemplify I like 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:24.430
 much use this shortcut key that the 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:29.109
 alt 0cm 12pt o haiti 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:31.659
 come back here yes be well in having and this 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:35.169
 photo here is going to have it in there 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:37.229
 exhibits her as her creator 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:41.079
 if you click on the side you will not have 

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:44.709
 people have to do this once and can 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:49.470
 bookmark all and create select all I 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.470
 I'll put the breeder here. 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:59.349
 09 50 's enter and it will complicate and it will 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.629
 ask if he wants you to apply this 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:04.290
 goal of this market in all the photos 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:04.290
 I'll say yes 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:13.000
 and here it is just move from one to the other 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:15.819
 The stage that is down here is already 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.070
 a creator and which metadata are the most 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:21.870
 important for you to put so let's go 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:25.690
 create a gift here and come the date 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:27.639
 to edit the gifts in this case I will 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.440
 create one 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:32.600
 and here is the basic information that 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:38.419
 you can put and what are the most 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:39.580
 important that I consider copyright and 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:43.940
 creator 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:48.470
 so I'm going to create a copyright here 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:51.770
 I'll put the 1 069 on the button 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:56.630
 was the copyright symbol 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:58.850
 to vote yes that being here can say that 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.470
 she is in the public domain she is 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.600
 Copyright and watched as I already voted 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:07.400
 here's this symbol here so i 'll say 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:08.270
 that she is with 4 to whom are the 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.889
 terms 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.990
 I will not put it here but there you can 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:14.360
 place here until the address of the laws 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:21.050
 Brazilian copyright and the terms right 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:23.180
 Here creator, yes, that being you can 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.220
 put the address is I always put 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.949
 I did not vote on the internet address. 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.240
 there are obvious reasons but it can be 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:33.789
 address of your studio you have 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:38.210
 interest that has rio de janeiro rj 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:40.240
 Brazil phone, I think this is 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.240
 important 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:50.120
 I will not put the rest and half 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:51.710
 This is really cool because even on the flick and 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.820
 then you can see if these 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.190
 information 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:57.380
 and then someone suddenly liked your 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:59.030
 work is going on there exists information and 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:02.870
 has all the information on how to get there 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:05.360
 even you a website 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.889
 I have my personal website but I have 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.720
 photo tips 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:10.720
 I'm going to put photogenics here. 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.900
 brasil.com.br 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.680
 here you can put who did the 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:24.540
 work is if I even then 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.120
 these data here are the ones I think most 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:29.400
 important than leaving a preset 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.990
 to put in all your photos right? 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:34.800
 here you can see that there are other 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:36.360
 more information but I think more 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.610
 interesting to leave only those two in the 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.740
 This entry already saved 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:44.610
 you can create a multitude of things 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:47.220
 here then done all this already put 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:49.620
 your name your data right there 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:51.180
 I will apply for damages and he will 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:56.390
 ask if I want to save and I'll go 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:56.390
 save common and bias and I'll put here 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:04.110
 who already feel that they are the 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:08.280
 my basic information 

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:14.700
 in my building ready and here I can 

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:19.890
 put check all control and here in 

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:22.440
 37 put copyright 50 and it goes 

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:24.330
 ask if I want to apply all the 

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:28.260
 photos selected I say yes 

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:31.200
 and you come here and welcome 

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.490

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:36.630
 is committed to all information 

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:39.120
 I put it and this is what I hope 

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:42.300
 I hope you use them because 

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:45.840
 really important and accompanies a 

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:48.290
 site photo of 2 brasil.com.br until 

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.290
 next
