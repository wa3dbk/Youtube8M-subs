most<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.369> time<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.820> there's<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.450> little

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
most of the time and there's a little

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.760 
most of the time and there's a little
bit<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.780> work<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.140> need<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.409> do<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.619> make

bit of work that I need to do to make
these<00:01:07.890> work<00:01:08.070> more<00:01:08.369> reliably<00:01:08.990> but<00:01:09.990> yeah<00:01:10.110> here

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
these work more reliably but yeah here

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.140 
these work more reliably but yeah here
it<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:10.740> it's<00:01:11.070> like<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.220> flappy<00:01:11.520> bird<00:01:11.670> and

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
it is so it's like a flappy bird and

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.240 
it is so it's like a flappy bird and

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
clone so you press up to flap up and

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.039 
clone so you press up to flap up and
dive<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.640> dive<00:01:14.790> down<00:01:14.970> I've<00:01:15.540> got<00:01:15.750> two<00:01:15.930> different

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
miraculous thing for me was about that

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.130

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
I can't took a better game I mean my

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.440 
I can't took a better game I mean my
high<00:01:49.170> scores<00:01:49.439> about<00:01:49.590> 12<00:01:50.000> I'm<00:01:51.000> not<00:01:51.180> currently

high scores about 12 I'm not currently
storing<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.810> high<00:01:51.869> scores<00:01:52.229> that's<00:01:52.470> a

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
storing the high scores that's a

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.580 
storing the high scores that's a
something<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.430> add<00:01:53.549> in<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.790> later<00:01:53.970> versions

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
something to add in the later versions

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.870 
something to add in the later versions
so<00:01:55.590> there's<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.159> few<00:01:56.310> problems<00:01:56.369> obviously<00:01:56.640> that

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
so there's a few problems obviously that

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.760 
so there's a few problems obviously that
I<00:01:56.909> need<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.119> solve<00:01:57.299> with<00:01:58.079> this<00:01:58.290> there's<00:01:58.680> lots

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
I need to solve with this there's lots

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.830 
I need to solve with this there's lots
of<00:01:58.920> changes<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.460> need<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.640> make<00:01:59.729> this<00:02:00.450> horrible

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
of changes I need to make this horrible

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.510 
of changes I need to make this horrible
flickering<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.710> there<00:02:01.920> columns<00:02:02.250> moving

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
flickering is there columns moving

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
across that definitely needs to get

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.899 
across that definitely needs to get
sorted<00:02:04.710> out<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.009> haven't<00:02:05.310> found<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.640> solution

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
sorted out and haven't found a solution

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.320 
sorted out and haven't found a solution
to<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.630> yet<00:02:07.429> yeah<00:02:08.429> there's<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:09.030> high-res

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330

low-res mode sorry if you didn't like
the<00:02:14.760> high-res<00:02:15.120> mode<00:02:15.150> you're<00:02:15.390> not<00:02:15.480> gonna<00:02:15.569> like

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
the high-res mode you're not gonna like

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.970 
the high-res mode you're not gonna like
the<00:02:15.840> low-res<00:02:16.110> mode<00:02:16.260> very<00:02:16.440> much<00:02:16.590> at<00:02:16.709> all

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
the low-res mode very much at all

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.240 
the low-res mode very much at all
it<00:02:17.730> looks<00:02:18.000> some<00:02:18.690> worse<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:19.739> uses<00:02:20.069> about<00:02:20.190> half

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
it looks some worse to uses about half

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.220 
it looks some worse to uses about half
the<00:02:20.730> number<00:02:20.940> of<00:02:20.970> cells<00:02:21.269> that<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.900> high-res

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
the number of cells that the high-res

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.160 
the number of cells that the high-res
mode<00:02:22.260> does<00:02:22.849> now<00:02:23.849> because<00:02:24.480> it<00:02:24.569> runs<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:25.019> lot

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
mode does now because it runs a lot

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.050 
mode does now because it runs a lot
quicker<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:26.069> can<00:02:26.099> see<00:02:26.370> hopefully<00:02:26.670> it's<00:02:26.910> a<00:02:26.940> lot

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
quicker you can see hopefully it's a lot

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.559 
quicker you can see hopefully it's a lot
smoother

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
smoother

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.530 
smoother
I<00:02:27.599> still<00:02:28.290> got<00:02:28.379> that<00:02:28.470> horrible<00:02:28.800> flickering<00:02:29.540> but

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
I still got that horrible flickering but

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.869 
I still got that horrible flickering but
obviously<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:30.840> looks<00:02:30.930> a<00:02:31.110> lot<00:02:31.230> worse<00:02:31.260> and

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:31.879 
obviously it looks a lot worse and

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:33.710 
obviously it looks a lot worse and
performance<00:02:32.879> wise<00:02:32.970> I'm<00:02:33.180> not<00:02:33.269> running<00:02:33.480> this<00:02:33.569> on

is<00:02:59.420> ok<00:03:00.420> so<00:03:00.480> that's<00:03:01.019> the<00:03:01.079> game<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.530> reason<00:03:01.709> I

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
is ok so that's the game the reason I

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.460 
is ok so that's the game the reason I
started<00:03:01.980> doing<00:03:02.220> this<00:03:02.310> by<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.790> way<00:03:02.940> is<00:03:03.660> because

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
started doing this by the way is because

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.809

afterwards and I thought well that'd be
a<00:04:11.489> pretty<00:04:11.700> cool<00:04:11.940> idea<00:04:12.030> I<00:04:12.150> wonder<00:04:12.299> if<00:04:12.359> I<00:04:12.389> can

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
a pretty cool idea I wonder if I can

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.509 
a pretty cool idea I wonder if I can
make<00:04:12.660> that<00:04:12.810> work<00:04:13.109> in<00:04:13.319> Excel<00:04:13.799> so<00:04:14.040> I<00:04:14.250> kind<00:04:14.459> of

make that work in Excel so I kind of

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.159 
make that work in Excel so I kind of
teach<00:04:14.639> excel<00:04:15.000> for<00:04:15.150> a<00:04:15.180> living<00:04:15.450> and<00:04:15.690> I<00:04:16.019> thought

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
teach excel for a living and I thought

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.909 
teach excel for a living and I thought
well<00:04:16.470> I<00:04:16.919> wonder<00:04:17.430> if<00:04:17.789> I<00:04:18.030> can<00:04:18.590> torture<00:04:19.590> Excel

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:36.800 
the background as well there's nothing
locked<00:04:36.090> down<00:04:36.180> there's<00:04:36.330> no<00:04:36.390> password

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
locked down there's no password

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:37.850 
locked down there's no password
protection<00:04:37.140> or<00:04:37.230> anything<00:04:37.380> on<00:04:37.500> this<00:04:37.620> workbook

protection or anything on this workbook

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.350 
protection or anything on this workbook
so<00:04:38.310> there's<00:04:38.430> a<00:04:38.460> bunch<00:04:38.610> of<00:04:38.700> hidden<00:04:38.820> worksheets

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
so there's a bunch of hidden worksheets

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.360 
so there's a bunch of hidden worksheets
which<00:04:39.690> you<00:04:39.810> can<00:04:39.900> happily<00:04:40.200> unhide<00:04:40.980> yourself

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
which you can happily unhide yourself

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.240 
which you can happily unhide yourself
like<00:04:42.030> so<00:04:42.210> and<00:04:42.530> for<00:04:43.530> instance<00:04:43.860> you<00:04:43.980> could<00:04:44.100> see

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
like so and for instance you could see

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.220 
like so and for instance you could see
the<00:04:44.370> sprite<00:04:44.700> sheet<00:04:44.730> and<00:04:45.450> look<00:04:46.020> at<00:04:46.140> my

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
the sprite sheet and look at my

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.470 
the sprite sheet and look at my
beautiful<00:04:47.190> artwork<00:04:47.490> if<00:04:48.060> you<00:04:48.150> think<00:04:48.330> you<00:04:48.390> can

beautiful artwork if you think you can

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.970 
beautiful artwork if you think you can
improve<00:04:48.690> on<00:04:48.810> that<00:04:48.990> and<00:04:49.140> let's<00:04:49.560> face<00:04:49.710> it<00:04:49.770> who

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980 
improve on that and let's face it who

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.100 
improve on that and let's face it who

sound effects if you wanted to you could
look<00:05:21.660> at<00:05:21.810> the<00:05:21.870> code<00:05:21.990> I've<00:05:22.110> written<00:05:22.260> like<00:05:22.620> the

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890 
look at the code I've written like the

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.500 
look at the code I've written like the
class<00:05:23.100> modules<00:05:23.520> and<00:05:23.820> the<00:05:23.880> standard<00:05:24.150> modules

class modules and the standard modules

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.330 
class modules and the standard modules
look<00:05:25.200> at<00:05:25.320> some<00:05:25.440> of<00:05:25.530> the<00:05:25.590> windows<00:05:26.250> API

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
look at some of the windows API

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.400 
look at some of the windows API
functions<00:05:26.910> that<00:05:27.000> I've<00:05:27.120> referenced<00:05:27.270> to<00:05:28.110> some

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
functions that I've referenced to some

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.820 
functions that I've referenced to some
quite<00:05:28.620> nice<00:05:29.070> more<00:05:29.880> advanced<00:05:30.390> ideas<00:05:30.960> and<00:05:31.230> that

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
quite nice more advanced ideas and that

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.020 
quite nice more advanced ideas and that
i've<00:05:31.950> used<00:05:32.130> or<00:05:32.250> advanced<00:05:32.550> techniques<00:05:32.850> i've

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
i've used or advanced techniques i've

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.840 
i've used or advanced techniques i've
used<00:05:33.210> in<00:05:33.390> developing<00:05:33.900> this<00:05:34.080> i<00:05:34.610> kind<00:05:35.610> of<00:05:35.640> got<00:05:35.730> to

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 
used in developing this i kind of got to

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.670 
used in developing this i kind of got to
thinking<00:05:36.150> at<00:05:36.270> that<00:05:36.300> point<00:05:36.390> that<00:05:36.960> this<00:05:37.410> might

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
thinking at that point that this might

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.590 
thinking at that point that this might
be<00:05:37.710> a<00:05:37.920> really<00:05:38.310> good<00:05:38.430> way<00:05:38.610> to<00:05:38.670> teach<00:05:38.940> about<00:05:39.180> some

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
be a really good way to teach about some

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.060 
be a really good way to teach about some
of<00:05:39.900> those<00:05:40.050> more<00:05:40.290> advanced<00:05:40.530> techniques<00:05:40.890> and

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
of those more advanced techniques and

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.740 
of those more advanced techniques and
how<00:05:41.130> they<00:05:41.280> work<00:05:41.430> in<00:05:41.610> excel<00:05:41.850> vba<00:05:41.880> so<00:05:42.690> i've

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
how they work in excel vba so i've

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.390 
how they work in excel vba so i've
created<00:05:42.990> video<00:05:43.440> series<00:05:43.890> and<00:05:44.100> written

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
created video series and written

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.550 
created video series and written
tutorials<00:05:44.940> about<00:05:45.030> how<00:05:45.120> to<00:05:45.270> use<00:05:45.480> excel<00:05:45.780> vba<00:05:45.810> but

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
tutorials about how to use excel vba but

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.650 
tutorials about how to use excel vba but
for<00:05:46.680> more<00:05:46.830> versi<00:05:47.150> tedious<00:05:48.150> business

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
for more versi tedious business

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.020 
for more versi tedious business
perspective<00:05:49.440> i<00:05:50.250> thought<00:05:50.700> this<00:05:50.820> would<00:05:50.910> be<00:05:50.970> a

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 
perspective i thought this would be a

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.310 
perspective i thought this would be a
nice<00:05:51.210> way<00:05:51.420> to<00:05:51.450> teach<00:05:51.810> about<00:05:51.930> some<00:05:52.110> of<00:05:52.170> the<00:05:52.230> more

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
nice way to teach about some of the more

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.840 
nice way to teach about some of the more
advanced<00:05:52.590> features<00:05:52.710> like<00:05:53.010> class<00:05:53.340> modules<00:05:53.700> and

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:53.850 
advanced features like class modules and

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.460 
advanced features like class modules and
so<00:05:53.940> on<00:05:54.090> something<00:05:54.750> like<00:05:54.900> the<00:05:54.990> writing<00:05:55.260> a

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
so on something like the writing a

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.650 
so on something like the writing a
tutorial<00:05:55.980> series<00:05:56.190> which<00:05:57.150> can<00:05:57.300> see<00:05:57.450> from<00:05:57.600> the

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 
tutorial series which can see from the

so<00:06:38.610> look<00:06:38.790> at<00:06:38.880> the<00:06:38.940> code<00:06:39.150> have<00:06:39.750> a<00:06:39.780> fiddle<00:06:40.080> around

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:40.170 
so look at the code have a fiddle around

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:41.900 
so look at the code have a fiddle around
here<00:06:40.560> it<00:06:40.650> works<00:06:40.800> maybe<00:06:41.160> change<00:06:41.460> a<00:06:41.550> few<00:06:41.670> things
