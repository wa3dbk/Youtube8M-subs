00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.319
 hello to everyone all with you evil x and and 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:09.389
 Welcome to maynkravt 1.8.1 no 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.120
 Of course the full release is not ready yet 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:16.619
 but today literally today came out 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:21.150
 minecraft 1.8.1 prerelease emn graph. 8.1 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:23.490
 prerelease 2 which means that the game 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.760
 pause continues to be improved 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.960
 small outlet snapshot of 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.539
 dimmer bomon himself on twitter was 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.489
 explained as nothing terrible just 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.300
 the release was very big and we needed 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.600
 time to deal with 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.730
 so welcome game continues 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.800
 evolve hooray hooray hooray 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.750
 and today i'm here to 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.840
 illustrate a small bug 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.969
 fixes that were set figuratively speaking 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.280
 innovations new snapshot and in 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:54.000
 first of all first as you know in 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.510
 maykravt 1.8 rabbits could be reasonable 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.039
 wives 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.500
 using a dandelion but if the player kept 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.750
 two chick in the hands of rabbits did not go after him 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.960
 now it has been changed and as you can see 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.000
 don't take a dandelion in your hands like this 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.830
 the rabbit happily jumps after me in 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.700
 hope that i will feed him of course 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.100
 my milaha was further corrected one of 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.200
 most probably the old gods who 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:25.110
 only was in the game this is a bug with portals 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.730
 because in the lower world now they 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.580
 redirect the player to daytona 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:33.490
 I think as you can see if I enter the face 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:38.770
 forward then in hell I must also appear 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:41.980
 facing forward but I think it is not done 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.170
 we will try to go portal sideways and if 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.330
 Now we will not run into the tank because 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.420
 in this version there is also a do tank 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.940
 am es wagons we leave here please 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.400
 quarters now no longer redirects the player 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.350
 This means that to navigate the hellish 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:00.340
 hubs will become significantly 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:03.760
 easier one more baht which was all the same 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.250
 fixed it as it turned out that the tank because 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.790
 that earlier it seemed so easy that 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.110
 conceived as you see we have a potion here 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.840
 jumping ability 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.210
 i'm using an untranslated game and 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.810
 now you can finally add them 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.830
 roadstone 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:25.090
 and make sure they give 8 minutes 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:27.430
 effect instead of three 86 now we are with you 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.990
 make sure just give it all 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.520
 to prepare to prepare to 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:37.620
 get ready before getting ready and said 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:40.170
 and bring the minutes of jumping now to us 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.060
 provided one more bug which to me 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.880
 personally it was very order to his 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.880
 corrected connected to the heads of the players like 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.890
 see if you click the button on the stage 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.710
 any block in the creative probably know 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:56.970
 you can get this block but it's not 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:59.100
 works very well with blocks that 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.560
 are heads of players and because 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.480
 if you get used to the middle button of how 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.040
 see you get the usual head and i 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.840
 I want exactly the head with this texture 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.240
 so what exactly to get 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.310
 this person's head i press control 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.100
 and the middle button that is the wheel and 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.520
 getting this head block and can it 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:20.760
 they say I can put it as you see no one 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.440
 for me it will not say anything everything works 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.930
 everything works great 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.270
 to the rest of this update itself 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.420
 The creeper relates to me now 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.040
 will try to attack the iron 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.910
 golems because the iron golem and not 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.490
 try to attack 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.930
 creeper and so they 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.160
 for them are dangerous creeper 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.000
 will no longer perceive iron 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.940
 golems as a threat another important baxik 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.540
 in my opinion this is what hut is now 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:52.680
 witches will have a slightly larger area 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:55.140
 spawn that is, if in fact itself at the hut 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.810
 We here such figuratively measuring the 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:01.470
 spawn zone height of the spawn zone at this 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.750
 huts now here is of course i'm here 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.270
 too figuratively figuring out but I was lucky 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.840
 today find the real wife of the witches 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.430
 so 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.319
 You have to attach so but 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.209
 on this is not really all because 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.909
 I would advise you to refer to the full 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.560
 In bug fix, I was very upset that 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:20.519
 the bug was not fixed 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:23.590
 as you can see for a second when you delete 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:28.470
 remove the bottom block from the high grass 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:31.900
 the flower block of this flower flashes 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:34.150
 peony but I think it's just marginal 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.300
 so we decided to leave it until I think 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:40.030
 that this bug is left to live long and 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:42.910
 of course they fixed the bug with the lighthouses earlier 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.289
 if you did not look at the lighthouse in 1.8 then you 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.330
 not seen and the beam from the lighthouse 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:48.639
 now it's fixed washing lora t-shirts 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.910
 work as before the beam is all the same 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:54.759
 displayed and now I think covered 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.410
 all necessary all important changes in 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:58.570
 nose on the bill thank you very much for your attention 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.400
 with you was evil speed 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.550
 I hope this week will please us 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:07.389
 Full update to Minecraft 1.8.1 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:10.349
