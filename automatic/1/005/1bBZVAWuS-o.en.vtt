me<00:00:30.119> just<00:00:30.150> first<00:00:30.510> ask<00:00:30.810> how<00:00:31.320> do<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.560> think<00:00:31.920> that

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
me just first ask how do you think that

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.000 
me just first ask how do you think that
your<00:00:32.940> players<00:00:33.270> will<00:00:33.600> attack<00:00:34.200> using<00:00:34.890> this

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
your players will attack using this

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.110 
your players will attack using this
formation<00:00:36.860> well<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.980> obvious<00:00:38.070> choice<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:39.090> to

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
formation well the obvious choice is to

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.020 
formation well the obvious choice is to
use<00:00:39.390> your<00:00:39.540> two<00:00:39.719> strikers<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.440> know<00:00:41.030> interfere

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
use your two strikers to know interfere

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.110 
use your two strikers to know interfere
with<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.420> defense's<00:00:43.610> but<00:00:44.610> how<00:00:44.820> are<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.000> going

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
with the defense's but how are you going

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.100 
with the defense's but how are you going
to<00:00:45.210> supply<00:00:45.480> balls<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.170> strikers<00:00:48.110> probably

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
to supply balls to the strikers probably

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.410 
to supply balls to the strikers probably
you<00:00:50.070> want<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.430> do<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.670> long<00:00:50.940> pass<00:00:51.180> through

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420

back<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.920> runner<00:00:56.870> or<00:00:59.239> you<00:01:00.239> could<00:01:00.449> ask<00:01:00.690> your

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
back to runner or you could ask your

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.889 
back to runner or you could ask your
midfielders<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.859> run<00:01:02.039> up<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.489> support<00:01:02.899> the

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
midfielders to run up to support the

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.580 
midfielders to run up to support the
attack<00:01:04.880> but<00:01:05.880> there<00:01:06.810> are<00:01:06.840> strengths<00:01:07.470> and

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
attack but there are strengths and

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.289 
attack but there are strengths and
weaknesses<00:01:07.920> for<00:01:08.070> formations<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.030> let<00:01:09.180> me

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
weaknesses for formations and let me

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.270 
weaknesses for formations and let me
just<00:01:09.510> discuss<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.320> right<00:01:10.500> now<00:01:10.530> what<00:01:11.130> are

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
just discuss to you right now what are

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.200 
just discuss to you right now what are
some<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.939> complications<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:13.020> using<00:01:13.320> this

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
some of the complications of using this

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.560 
some of the complications of using this
tactic<00:01:16.009> now<00:01:17.009> one<00:01:17.159> number<00:01:17.759> one<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:18.060> if<00:01:18.270> your

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
tactic now one number one is if your

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.350 
tactic now one number one is if your
players<00:01:19.140> are<00:01:19.290> not<00:01:19.439> going<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.710> run<00:01:19.830> up<00:01:20.360> they

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
players are not going to run up they

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.700 
players are not going to run up they
have<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.600> call<00:01:21.780> me<00:01:21.900> two<00:01:22.020> long<00:01:22.229> passes<00:01:22.409> or

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
have to call me two long passes or

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.370 
have to call me two long passes or
crosses<00:01:23.189> through<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.520> midfield<00:01:23.729> or<00:01:24.350> from<00:01:25.350> the

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
crosses through the midfield or from the

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.880 
crosses through the midfield or from the
site<00:01:25.710> from<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.520> from<00:01:27.150> your<00:01:27.270> defense<00:01:27.689> line<00:01:27.990> and

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
site from the from your defense line and

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.330 
site from the from your defense line and
this<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.850> not<00:01:30.030> very<00:01:30.229> good<00:01:31.229> if<00:01:31.439> your<00:01:31.979> players

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
this is not very good if your players

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.219 
this is not very good if your players
are<00:01:32.610> not<00:01:32.820> having<00:01:33.000> high<00:01:33.329> attributes<00:01:33.900> for<00:01:34.020> your

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
are not having high attributes for your

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.570 
are not having high attributes for your
for<00:01:34.920> long<00:01:35.130> passes<00:01:35.610> or<00:01:35.869> four<00:01:36.869> crosses<00:01:37.140> and

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
for long passes or four crosses and

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.390 
for long passes or four crosses and
and<00:01:39.530> I'm<00:01:40.530> playing<00:01:40.860> in<00:01:41.010> the<00:01:41.100> coca-cola

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
and I'm playing in the coca-cola

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.910 
and I'm playing in the coca-cola
championship<00:01:42.090> link<00:01:42.330> so<00:01:43.170> most<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.620> clubs

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
championship link so most of the clubs

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.800 
championship link so most of the clubs
they<00:01:44.220> have<00:01:44.670> players<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.120> do<00:01:45.390> not<00:01:45.510> really

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
they have players that do not really

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.400 
they have players that do not really
have<00:01:46.110> good<00:01:46.590> technical<00:01:47.190> attributes<00:01:47.360> and<00:01:48.410> so

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
have good technical attributes and so

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.860 
have good technical attributes and so
usually<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.490> mean<00:01:50.820> unless<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.330> are<00:01:51.420> playing<00:01:51.750> a

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
usually I mean unless you are playing a

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.670 
usually I mean unless you are playing a
top-tier<00:01:52.260> League<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.740> so<00:01:54.380> this<00:01:55.380> kind<00:01:55.620> of

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
top-tier League and so this kind of

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.680 
top-tier League and so this kind of
tactics<00:01:55.980> is<00:01:56.130> not<00:01:56.400> really<00:01:56.670> preferred<00:01:57.210> for

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
tactics is not really preferred for

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.280 
tactics is not really preferred for
coca-cola<00:01:58.200> championship<00:01:58.800> league<00:01:58.980> and<00:01:59.160> low

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
coca-cola championship league and low

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.080 
coca-cola championship league and low
for<00:02:01.290> our<00:02:01.440> ethical<00:02:01.830> attacking<00:02:02.460> options<00:02:02.880> of

for our ethical attacking options of

for our ethical attacking options of
course<00:02:03.650> defensively<00:02:04.650> this<00:02:05.580> is<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.730> very<00:02:06.120> very

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
course defensively this is a very very

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.499 
course defensively this is a very very
strong<00:02:07.040> team<00:02:08.040> simply<00:02:08.729> because<00:02:08.850> we<00:02:09.060> have<00:02:09.300> five

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509

no five defenders protecting the defense

example<00:02:51.630> in<00:02:52.110> Newcastle's<00:02:52.920> case<00:02:53.750> my<00:02:54.750> players

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
example in Newcastle's case my players

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.840 
example in Newcastle's case my players
are<00:02:55.230> very<00:02:55.440> physical<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.100> therefore<00:02:56.640> they

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
are very physical and therefore they

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.100 
are very physical and therefore they
prefer<00:02:57.300> to<00:02:57.330> write<00:02:57.720> they<00:02:58.110> can<00:02:58.290> run<00:02:58.500> and<00:02:58.769> outrun

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
prefer to write they can run and outrun

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.130 
prefer to write they can run and outrun
the<00:03:01.110> opposition<00:03:01.620> very<00:03:01.830> fast<00:03:02.209> so<00:03:03.209> I<00:03:03.480> usually

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
the opposition very fast so I usually

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.259 
the opposition very fast so I usually
capitalize<00:03:04.650> it<00:03:04.680> and<00:03:05.070> by<00:03:05.400> using<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:05.850> photo

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
capitalize it and by using the photo

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.330
