00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:30.379 
matches and we I think we all of us just

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.920 
matches and we I think we all of us just
saying<00:02:30.650> that<00:02:31.000> it's<00:02:32.000> too<00:02:32.209> hot<00:02:32.420> and<00:02:33.910> and

saying that it's too hot and and

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.490

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
sometimes you know you're playing

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.680 
sometimes you know you're playing
because<00:02:36.920> automatic<00:02:37.790> thing<00:02:38.000> is<00:02:38.239> that<00:02:38.360> i'm<00:02:38.480> not

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
because automatic thing is that i'm not

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.259 
because automatic thing is that i'm not
thinking<00:02:38.870> because<00:02:39.440> it's<00:02:39.739> just<00:02:40.160> it's<00:02:40.849> just<00:02:40.970> so

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.150 

a<00:05:07.930> lot<00:05:08.410> of<00:05:08.440> matches

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
a lot of matches

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.110 
a lot of matches
or<00:05:10.520> you<00:05:10.670> so<00:05:10.850> confident

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
or you so confident

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.930 
or you so confident
it<00:05:12.210> doesn't<00:05:12.870> matter

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
it doesn't matter

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.530 
it doesn't matter
I<00:05:15.000> mean<00:05:15.660> so<00:05:15.900> far<00:05:16.080> I<00:05:16.140> feel<00:05:16.470> fine<00:05:16.680> so<00:05:17.220> I<00:05:17.790> don't

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
I mean so far I feel fine so I don't

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.870 
I mean so far I feel fine so I don't
having<00:05:18.750> problems<00:05:19.170> and<00:05:20.130> this<00:05:20.250> is<00:05:20.370> beginning<00:05:20.760> of

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
having problems and this is beginning of

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.260 
having problems and this is beginning of
the<00:05:21.060> year<00:05:21.300> so<00:05:22.100> it's<00:05:23.100> not<00:05:23.250> like<00:05:23.460> in<00:05:23.670> the<00:05:23.700> end<00:05:24.000> of

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
the year so it's not like in the end of

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.120 
the year so it's not like in the end of
the<00:05:24.480> year<00:05:24.600> that<00:05:24.780> we<00:05:25.500> played<00:05:25.740> so<00:05:25.950> many

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
the year that we played so many

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.400 
the year that we played so many
tournaments<00:05:26.490> so<00:05:26.790> many<00:05:26.940> matches<00:05:27.360> and<00:05:27.660> we<00:05:28.230> can

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
tournaments so many matches and we can

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.230 
tournaments so many matches and we can
think<00:05:28.620> it's<00:05:29.010> sometimes<00:05:29.400> it's<00:05:29.490> too<00:05:29.700> much<00:05:29.850> and

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
think it's sometimes it's too much and

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.330 
think it's sometimes it's too much and
it's<00:05:30.780> better<00:05:31.410> not<00:05:31.650> to<00:05:31.710> play<00:05:32.010> everything

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
it's better not to play everything

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.660 
it's better not to play everything
before<00:05:32.910> the<00:05:33.120> grand<00:05:33.330> slam<00:05:33.600> but<00:05:33.930> so<00:05:34.830> far<00:05:35.070> it's

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:35.670 
before the grand slam but so far it's

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.480 
before the grand slam but so far it's
I'm<00:05:35.940> feeling<00:05:36.300> good<00:05:36.480> so<00:05:36.840> I<00:05:37.170> think<00:05:38.100> it's<00:05:38.370> still

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
I'm feeling good so I think it's still

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:45.400 
I'm feeling good so I think it's still
good<00:05:38.880> preparation<00:05:39.510> before<00:05:39.900> show<00:05:40.200> you<00:05:40.260> open<00:05:42.620> oh

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.410 
good preparation before show you open oh

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.760 
good preparation before show you open oh
well<00:05:47.090> for<00:05:48.090> sure<00:05:48.270> I<00:05:48.510> think<00:05:48.810> it<00:05:49.200> was<00:05:49.350> made<00:05:49.620> the

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
well for sure I think it was made the

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.940 
well for sure I think it was made the
best<00:05:49.950> tennis<00:05:50.370> does<00:05:50.790> for<00:05:51.000> sure<00:05:51.560> well<00:05:52.560> but

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:52.950 
best tennis does for sure well but

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.400 
best tennis does for sure well but
especially<00:05:53.700> in<00:05:54.090> the<00:05:54.180> first<00:05:54.360> set<00:05:54.630> was<00:05:54.810> was<00:05:55.170> kind

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.410 
especially in the first set was was kind

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.570 
especially in the first set was was kind
of<00:05:55.470> weird<00:05:55.740> a<00:05:55.980> lot<00:05:56.100> of<00:05:56.250> breaks<00:05:56.520> and<00:05:58.370> in<00:05:59.370> the

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
of weird a lot of breaks and in the

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.080 
of weird a lot of breaks and in the
second<00:05:59.970> set<00:06:00.180> I<00:06:00.570> felt<00:06:01.200> a<00:06:01.320> bit<00:06:01.560> better<00:06:02.090> we're

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
second set I felt a bit better we're

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:04.340 
second set I felt a bit better we're
just<00:06:03.270> going<00:06:03.450> to<00:06:03.480> shun<00:06:03.660> I<00:06:03.690> think<00:06:03.930> I<00:06:04.080> kind<00:06:04.320> of

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 
just going to shun I think I kind of

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:09.800 
just going to shun I think I kind of
used<00:06:04.590> to<00:06:04.680> it<00:06:06.350> but<00:06:07.350> it<00:06:08.070> was<00:06:08.250> still<00:06:08.630> I'm<00:06:09.630> still
