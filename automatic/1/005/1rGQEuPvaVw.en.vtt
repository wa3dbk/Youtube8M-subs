80 in in the ad map and there are five
nodes<00:00:53.900> in<00:00:54.520> both<00:00:55.520> of<00:00:55.700> those<00:00:55.760> maps<00:00:56.060> so<00:00:56.720> 10<00:00:57.260> nodes

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:57.560 
nodes in both of those maps so 10 nodes

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.700 
nodes in both of those maps so 10 nodes
in<00:00:57.920> total<00:00:58.370> there<00:00:58.790> is<00:00:58.970> some<00:00:59.180> some<00:00:59.989> two<00:01:00.350> of<00:01:00.500> them

in<00:01:00.920> frost<00:01:01.850> Gorge<00:01:02.210> but<00:01:02.570> I'm<00:01:02.780> just<00:01:03.140> so<00:01:03.920> lazy<00:01:04.250> to

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
in frost Gorge but I'm just so lazy to

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.399 
in frost Gorge but I'm just so lazy to
teleport<00:01:05.149> there<00:01:05.449> for<00:01:05.659> like<00:01:05.780> three<00:01:06.110> four

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
teleport there for like three four

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.040 
teleport there for like three four
silver<00:01:06.950> and<00:01:07.159> pick<00:01:08.090> two<00:01:08.360> nodes<00:01:08.600> and<00:01:08.780> trying<00:01:08.960> to

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
silver and pick two nodes and trying to

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.860 
silver and pick two nodes and trying to
find<00:01:09.260> it<00:01:09.470> in<00:01:09.590> the<00:01:09.710> humongous<00:01:10.700> map<00:01:11.000> that<00:01:11.300> is<00:01:11.630> so

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:11.870 
find it in the humongous map that is so

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.100 
find it in the humongous map that is so
I<00:01:12.110> stick<00:01:12.860> to<00:01:12.890> or<00:01:13.250> because<00:01:13.520> I<00:01:13.820> don't<00:01:14.330> see<00:01:14.659> that

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
I stick to or because I don't see that

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.960 
I stick to or because I don't see that
it's<00:01:15.320> worth<00:01:15.680> it<00:01:15.890> for<00:01:16.100> me<00:01:16.130> going<00:01:16.400> over<00:01:16.820> there

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
it's worth it for me going over there

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.610 
it's worth it for me going over there
unless<00:01:17.150> I'm<00:01:17.420> already<00:01:17.600> over<00:01:18.140> there<00:01:18.290> in<00:01:18.530> the

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620 
unless I'm already over there in the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.649 
unless I'm already over there in the
first<00:01:18.890> place<00:01:18.979> so<00:01:19.549> generally<00:01:19.970> in<00:01:20.150> the<00:01:20.240> or<00:01:20.390> run

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
first place so generally in the or run

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.140 
first place so generally in the or run
you<00:01:20.840> find<00:01:21.140> five<00:01:21.500> in<00:01:21.680> each<00:01:21.770> map<00:01:22.070> so<00:01:22.490> it'll<00:01:23.060> be

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
you find five in each map so it'll be

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.440 
you find five in each map so it'll be
ten<00:01:23.450> you're<00:01:24.290> going<00:01:24.409> to<00:01:24.470> get<00:01:24.530> about<00:01:24.740> 30

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
ten you're going to get about 30

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.149 
ten you're going to get about 30
orichalcum<00:01:26.450> oars<00:01:26.810> now<00:01:27.500> you<00:01:27.560> can<00:01:27.860> choose<00:01:28.130> to

sell<00:01:28.640> those<00:01:28.880> to<00:01:29.180> get<00:01:29.360> money<00:01:29.659> or<00:01:29.960> you<00:01:30.320> can<00:01:30.500> use

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
sell those to get money or you can use

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.980 
sell those to get money or you can use
them<00:01:30.890> to<00:01:31.040> correct<00:01:31.280> your<00:01:31.490> exotics<00:01:32.090> and<00:01:32.360> weapons

pretty hard to get 2 i'll show the
others<00:02:08.450> anyway<00:02:08.899> just<00:02:09.200> in<00:02:09.319> case<00:02:09.379> you<00:02:09.679> guys

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:09.799 
others anyway just in case you guys

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:12.159 
others anyway just in case you guys
actually<00:02:10.039> want<00:02:10.369> to<00:02:10.519> see<00:02:10.729> that<00:02:10.759> but<00:02:11.659> the<00:02:11.870> first

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:12.169 
actually want to see that but the first

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:14.920 
actually want to see that but the first
one<00:02:12.379> in<00:02:12.650> malkura<00:02:13.159> sleep<00:02:13.430> by<00:02:14.029> pegas<00:02:14.450> waypoint

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
one in malkura sleep by pegas waypoint

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.860 
one in malkura sleep by pegas waypoint
is<00:02:15.109> probably<00:02:15.950> one<00:02:16.790> of<00:02:16.819> the<00:02:16.939> hardest<00:02:17.299> not

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
is probably one of the hardest not

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.860 
is probably one of the hardest not
it<00:02:17.900> starts<00:02:18.260> with<00:02:18.349> a<00:02:18.409> jumping<00:02:18.980> puzzle<00:02:19.549> yeah<00:02:20.299> so

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
it starts with a jumping puzzle yeah so

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.320 
it starts with a jumping puzzle yeah so
I<00:02:20.900> don't<00:02:21.290> know<00:02:21.470> if<00:02:21.769> it<00:02:22.400> will<00:02:22.519> be<00:02:22.580> worth<00:02:22.940> it<00:02:23.150> to

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
I don't know if it will be worth it to

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.839 
I don't know if it will be worth it to
get<00:02:23.480> it<00:02:23.659> because<00:02:23.750> I<00:02:23.989> I<00:02:24.019> do<00:02:24.290> i<00:02:24.769> do<00:02:25.129> this<00:02:25.400> run<00:02:25.670> like

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
get it because I I do i do this run like

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.750 
get it because I I do i do this run like
three<00:02:26.120> times<00:02:26.500> so<00:02:27.500> it's<00:02:28.010> it's<00:02:28.370> a<00:02:28.519> little

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
three times so it's it's a little

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.130 
three times so it's it's a little
annoying<00:02:28.970> that<00:02:29.239> you<00:02:29.299> have<00:02:29.510> to<00:02:29.629> do<00:02:29.750> a<00:02:29.780> jumping

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
annoying that you have to do a jumping

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.839 
annoying that you have to do a jumping
puzzle<00:02:30.500> to<00:02:30.620> actually<00:02:31.010> get<00:02:31.220> there<00:02:31.430> I<00:02:31.459> guess<00:02:31.700> is

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
puzzle to actually get there I guess is

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.580 
puzzle to actually get there I guess is
a<00:02:31.879> good<00:02:31.970> way<00:02:32.239> to<00:02:32.269> start<00:02:32.690> off<00:02:32.900> with<00:02:33.379> that<00:02:33.530> a

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
a good way to start off with that a

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.949 
a good way to start off with that a
mocker<00:02:33.890> asleep<00:02:34.220> if<00:02:34.430> you<00:02:34.610> gonna<00:02:34.849> do<00:02:35.180> that<00:02:35.420> while

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
mocker asleep if you gonna do that while

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.440 
mocker asleep if you gonna do that while
I'm<00:02:36.170> in<00:02:36.319> or<00:02:36.530> of<00:02:36.920> anyone<00:02:37.579> noticed<00:02:38.060> that<00:02:38.269> they
