so<00:00:18.210> what<00:00:18.330> kind<00:00:18.540> of<00:00:18.630> species<00:00:18.840> leaves<00:00:19.290> their

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
so what kind of species leaves their

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.810 
so what kind of species leaves their
rhesus<00:00:20.580> macaques<00:00:21.000> of<00:00:21.960> Indian<00:00:22.350> origin<00:00:22.800> on<00:00:23.760> the

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
rhesus macaques of Indian origin on the

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.990 
rhesus macaques of Indian origin on the
Indian<00:00:24.150> subcontinent<00:00:24.770> and<00:00:25.770> why<00:00:26.370> is<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:26.610> these

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
Indian subcontinent and why is it these

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.220 
Indian subcontinent and why is it these
are<00:00:27.210> used<00:00:27.420> in<00:00:27.750> medical<00:00:28.080> research<00:00:29.150> well<00:00:30.230> they

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
are used in medical research well they

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.230 
are used in medical research well they
are<00:00:31.740> very<00:00:32.010> useful<00:00:32.369> for<00:00:32.400> certain<00:00:32.790> types<00:00:33.030> of

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:33.240 
are very useful for certain types of

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.020 
are very useful for certain types of
work<00:00:33.500> so<00:00:34.640> obviously<00:00:35.640> they're<00:00:35.820> closely

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
work so obviously they're closely

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.620 
work so obviously they're closely
related<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.660> humans<00:00:36.809> as<00:00:37.410> everyone<00:00:38.190> knows<00:00:38.630> so

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:39.630 
related to humans as everyone knows so

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.869 
related to humans as everyone knows so
they<00:00:39.720> have<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:40.290> lot<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:40.710> similar<00:00:41.400> pathways

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
they have a lot of similar pathways

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.820 
they have a lot of similar pathways
their<00:00:42.210> eyes<00:00:42.390> as<00:00:42.780> well<00:00:42.930> for<00:00:43.379> example<00:00:43.710> are<00:00:43.800> very

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:43.830 
their eyes as well for example are very

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.950 
their eyes as well for example are very
similar<00:00:44.220> as<00:00:44.370> one<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.550> their<00:00:44.790> brains

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
similar as one of their brains

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.530 
similar as one of their brains
they<00:00:46.950> have<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.220> what<00:00:47.730> they<00:00:47.790> call<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:48.030> central

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
they have a what they call a central

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.950 
they have a what they call a central
phobia<00:00:49.070> which<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:50.490> they<00:00:50.730> use<00:00:51.180> for<00:00:51.390> example<00:00:51.870> in

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
phobia which so they use for example in

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.620 
phobia which so they use for example in
studies<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.530> macular<00:00:53.250> degeneration<00:00:53.420> so<00:00:54.420> they

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:54.630 
studies of macular degeneration so they

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.020 
studies of macular degeneration so they
they<00:00:55.110> have<00:00:55.440> similar<00:00:55.980> pathways<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:56.700> terms<00:00:56.910> of

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
they have similar pathways in terms of

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.030 
they have similar pathways in terms of
hand<00:00:57.210> movements<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:57.930> things<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.860> people

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
hand movements and things so people

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.400 
hand movements and things so people
study<00:00:59.460> those<00:00:59.700> as<00:00:59.940> well<00:01:00.150> and<00:01:00.989> they<00:01:01.079> will<00:01:01.200> see

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
study those as well and they will see

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.520 
study those as well and they will see
used<00:01:01.620> for<00:01:01.890> things<00:01:02.070> like<00:01:02.190> vaccine<00:01:02.820> work<00:01:03.530> so

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
used for things like vaccine work so

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:15.500 
used for things like vaccine work so
aids<00:01:05.100> TV

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.330 

so<00:01:16.510> we<00:01:16.690> were<00:01:16.780> interested<00:01:16.930> in<00:01:17.380> the<00:01:17.800> the<00:01:18.100> brain

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
so we were interested in the the brain

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.010 
so we were interested in the the brain
and<00:01:18.730> the<00:01:18.880> spinal<00:01:19.150> cord<00:01:19.480> of<00:01:19.540> your<00:01:19.660> nervous

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
and the spinal cord of your nervous

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.340 
and the spinal cord of your nervous
system<00:01:20.140> and<00:01:20.800> things<00:01:21.790> that<00:01:21.940> we<00:01:22.000> can<00:01:22.180> do<00:01:22.390> to<00:01:23.140> help

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
system and things that we can do to help

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.860 
system and things that we can do to help
when<00:01:23.620> those<00:01:23.800> structures<00:01:24.370> go<00:01:24.550> wrong<00:01:24.870> primates

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
when those structures go wrong primates

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.930 
when those structures go wrong primates
including<00:01:26.140> humans<00:01:26.470> and<00:01:26.980> monkeys<00:01:27.190> have

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
including humans and monkeys have

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.080 
including humans and monkeys have
developed<00:01:28.420> a<00:01:28.570> unique<00:01:29.820> pathway<00:01:30.820> by<00:01:31.060> which

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
developed a unique pathway by which

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.090 
developed a unique pathway by which
signals<00:01:31.720> get<00:01:31.960> from<00:01:32.200> the<00:01:32.320> brain<00:01:32.560> to<00:01:32.830> the

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
signals get from the brain to the

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.800 
signals get from the brain to the
muscles<00:01:33.190> controlling<00:01:33.970> the<00:01:34.240> arm<00:01:34.390> in<00:01:34.540> the<00:01:34.600> hand

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
muscles controlling the arm in the hand

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.070 
muscles controlling the arm in the hand
now<00:01:35.380> that's<00:01:35.590> not<00:01:35.800> shared<00:01:36.130> with<00:01:36.510> mice<00:01:37.510> and<00:01:37.870> rats

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
now that's not shared with mice and rats

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.680 
now that's not shared with mice and rats
who<00:01:38.890> walk<00:01:39.250> on<00:01:39.430> all<00:01:39.580> fours<00:01:39.610> and<00:01:40.210> use<00:01:40.390> their

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
who walk on all fours and use their

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.230 
who walk on all fours and use their
their<00:01:41.140> four<00:01:41.440> limbs<00:01:41.680> for<00:01:41.950> locomotion<00:01:42.370> rather

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
their four limbs for locomotion rather

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.030 
their four limbs for locomotion rather
than<00:01:43.570> that<00:01:43.810> the<00:01:43.990> types<00:01:44.229> of<00:01:44.410> movements<00:01:44.830> that<00:01:44.860> we

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
than that the types of movements that we

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.770 
than that the types of movements that we
do<00:01:45.190> with<00:01:45.340> our<00:01:45.430> hands<00:01:45.880> like<00:01:46.270> reaching<00:01:46.540> for

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
do with our hands like reaching for

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.260 
do with our hands like reaching for
objects<00:01:47.440> grasping<00:01:47.950> them<00:01:48.119> manipulating<00:01:49.119> them

objects grasping them manipulating them

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.600 
objects grasping them manipulating them
so<00:01:49.810> to<00:01:49.900> study<00:01:50.259> the<00:01:50.440> pathways<00:01:50.890> that<00:01:51.160> that

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
so to study the pathways that that

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.580 
so to study the pathways that that
control<00:01:51.970> these<00:01:52.180> behaviors<00:01:52.690> and<00:01:53.050> ultimately

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
control these behaviors and ultimately

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.410 
control these behaviors and ultimately
to<00:01:53.830> work<00:01:54.250> out<00:01:54.430> ways<00:01:54.640> to<00:01:54.670> restore<00:01:55.210> these

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
to work out ways to restore these

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.600 
to work out ways to restore these
behaviors<00:01:55.869> in<00:01:56.050> humans<00:01:56.440> we<00:01:57.009> need<00:01:57.190> to<00:01:57.250> use<00:01:57.580> a

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
behaviors in humans we need to use a

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.960 
behaviors in humans we need to use a
species<00:01:58.150> that<00:01:58.390> has<00:01:58.690> a<00:01:58.869> similar<00:01:59.580> similar<00:02:00.580> arm

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
species that has a similar similar arm

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.240 
species that has a similar similar arm
and<00:02:01.180> hand<00:02:01.330> function<00:02:01.810> to<00:02:02.020> humans<00:02:02.590> so<00:02:02.830> an

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
and hand function to humans so an

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.749 
and hand function to humans so an
important<00:02:03.550> point<00:02:03.640> to<00:02:03.790> realize<00:02:04.119> is<00:02:04.360> that<00:02:05.759> when

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
important point to realize is that when

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:08.460 
important point to realize is that when
you're<00:02:06.910> if<00:02:07.240> you're<00:02:07.390> if<00:02:07.570> you're<00:02:07.600> paralyzed<00:02:08.170> by

you're if you're if you're paralyzed by
an<00:02:08.560> injury<00:02:08.860> to<00:02:08.950> the<00:02:09.100> spinal<00:02:09.429> cord<00:02:09.580> all<00:02:10.509> of<00:02:10.720> this

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
an injury to the spinal cord all of this

to<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.290> arm<00:02:26.440> and<00:02:26.880> therefore<00:02:27.880> that<00:02:28.000> the

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
to the arm and therefore that the

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.210 
to the arm and therefore that the
muscles<00:02:28.510> aren't<00:02:28.750> able<00:02:28.900> to<00:02:29.080> contract<00:02:29.440> but<00:02:30.100> the

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
muscles aren't able to contract but the

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.410 
muscles aren't able to contract but the
signals<00:02:30.610> are<00:02:30.700> still<00:02:30.910> there<00:02:31.090> in<00:02:31.120> your<00:02:31.269> brain

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
signals are still there in your brain

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.479 
signals are still there in your brain
and<00:02:31.810> we<00:02:32.140> can<00:02:32.290> use<00:02:32.500> these<00:02:32.680> techniques<00:02:33.040> to<00:02:33.190> read

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
and we can use these techniques to read

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.670 
and we can use these techniques to read
those<00:02:33.700> signals<00:02:34.090> out<00:02:34.299> and<00:02:34.870> either<00:02:35.140> send<00:02:35.530> them

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
those signals out and either send them

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.410 
those signals out and either send them
to<00:02:35.860> an<00:02:35.950> external<00:02:36.220> device<00:02:36.640> send<00:02:37.150> them<00:02:37.299> to<00:02:37.390> a

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
to an external device send them to a

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.990 
to an external device send them to a
computer<00:02:37.780> or<00:02:38.440> send<00:02:38.650> them<00:02:38.769> to<00:02:38.890> a<00:02:38.920> wheelchair<00:02:39.190> so

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
computer or send them to a wheelchair so

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.220 
computer or send them to a wheelchair so
that<00:02:40.150> you<00:02:40.209> can<00:02:40.360> communicate<00:02:40.900> with<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.200> world

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
that you can communicate with the world

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.350 
that you can communicate with the world
you<00:02:41.620> can<00:02:41.769> move<00:02:41.950> around<00:02:42.070> in<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.519> world<00:02:42.640> so<00:02:43.330> a

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
you can move around in the world so a

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.449 
you can move around in the world so a
lot<00:02:43.510> of<00:02:43.540> my<00:02:43.690> work<00:02:43.989> involves<00:02:44.230> training<00:02:44.980> animals

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
lot of my work involves training animals

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.720 
lot of my work involves training animals
to<00:02:45.610> perform<00:02:45.730> particular<00:02:46.590> movements<00:02:47.590> and<00:02:48.519> then

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
to perform particular movements and then

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.280 
to perform particular movements and then
listening<00:02:49.390> to<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:49.630> activity<00:02:50.080> in<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:50.260> brain

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
listening to the activity in the brain

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.020 
listening to the activity in the brain
at<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.769> same<00:02:50.980> time<00:02:51.280> as<00:02:51.519> the<00:02:51.640> monkey<00:02:51.910> is

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
at the same time as the monkey is

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.600 
at the same time as the monkey is
performing<00:02:52.510> these<00:02:52.900> movements<00:02:53.440> so<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.400> first

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
performing these movements so the first

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.310 
performing these movements so the first
question<00:02:54.910> we're<00:02:55.239> interested<00:02:55.660> in<00:02:55.720> is<00:02:55.870> how<00:02:56.080> is

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
question we're interested in is how is

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.460 
question we're interested in is how is
information<00:02:56.470> represented<00:02:57.070> in<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.150> brain

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
information represented in the brain

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.720 
information represented in the brain
before<00:02:59.470> it's<00:02:59.620> sent<00:02:59.830> down<00:03:00.070> to<00:03:00.310> the<00:03:00.430> to<00:03:00.640> the

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
before it's sent down to the to the

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.180 
before it's sent down to the to the
limbs<00:03:00.940> to<00:03:01.090> to<00:03:01.510> produce<00:03:01.690> a<00:03:01.930> movement<00:03:02.350> so<00:03:03.070> in

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
limbs to to produce a movement so in

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.430 
limbs to to produce a movement so in
order<00:03:03.430> to<00:03:03.519> do<00:03:03.640> this<00:03:03.790> we<00:03:03.940> use<00:03:04.120> very<00:03:04.360> fine

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
order to do this we use very fine

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.979 
order to do this we use very fine
metal<00:03:06.100> electrodes<00:03:06.700> fine<00:03:07.450> metal<00:03:07.780> wires

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
metal electrodes fine metal wires

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.039 
metal electrodes fine metal wires
inserted<00:03:08.830> into<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:09.310> brain<00:03:09.790> to<00:03:10.060> listen<00:03:10.750> to<00:03:10.930> the

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
inserted into the brain to listen to the

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.920 
inserted into the brain to listen to the
the<00:03:11.860> activity<00:03:12.400> within<00:03:12.910> the<00:03:13.060> brain<00:03:13.360> so<00:03:13.780> this

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
the activity within the brain so this

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.000 
the activity within the brain so this
shows<00:03:14.140> some<00:03:14.320> footage<00:03:14.650> of<00:03:14.769> an<00:03:14.860> actual

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
shows some footage of an actual

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.090 
shows some footage of an actual
experiment<00:03:15.489> and<00:03:16.329> here<00:03:16.690> what<00:03:17.260> the<00:03:17.470> monkey<00:03:18.010> is

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
experiment and here what the monkey is

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.220 
experiment and here what the monkey is
doing<00:03:18.400> is<00:03:18.579> controlling<00:03:19.030> this<00:03:19.390> yellow<00:03:19.660> cursor

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
doing is controlling this yellow cursor

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.790 
doing is controlling this yellow cursor
and<00:03:20.440> moving<00:03:21.100> it<00:03:21.220> to<00:03:21.250> various<00:03:22.260> red<00:03:23.260> targets

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
and moving it to various red targets

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.740 
and moving it to various red targets
that<00:03:23.950> appear<00:03:24.250> on<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.430> screen<00:03:24.690> now<00:03:25.690> the

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
that appear on the screen now the

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.320 
that appear on the screen now the
interesting<00:03:26.050> thing<00:03:26.319> about<00:03:26.380> this<00:03:26.680> is

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
interesting thing about this is

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.200 
interesting thing about this is
he<00:03:27.540> isn't<00:03:27.810> controlling<00:03:28.170> this<00:03:28.790> using<00:03:29.790> using

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
he isn't controlling this using using

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.630 
he isn't controlling this using using
her<00:03:30.900> hand<00:03:31.170> she's<00:03:31.800> actually<00:03:31.950> controlling<00:03:32.550> this

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
her hand she's actually controlling this

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.030 
her hand she's actually controlling this
cursor<00:03:33.090> using<00:03:33.510> signals<00:03:34.050> from<00:03:34.140> the<00:03:34.290> brain<00:03:34.410> and

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
cursor using signals from the brain and

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.380 
cursor using signals from the brain and
what<00:03:35.220> you<00:03:35.310> can<00:03:35.430> hear<00:03:35.610> in<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:35.820> background<00:03:36.000> is

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
what you can hear in the background is

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.060 
what you can hear in the background is
clicking<00:03:36.780> sound<00:03:37.080> these<00:03:37.590> are<00:03:37.710> actually<00:03:37.950> the

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
clicking sound these are actually the

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.680 
clicking sound these are actually the
electrical<00:03:38.520> signals<00:03:38.910> from<00:03:39.090> a<00:03:39.150> single<00:03:39.480> neuron

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
electrical signals from a single neuron

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.930 
electrical signals from a single neuron
in<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:39.930> brain<00:03:40.020> which<00:03:40.920> is<00:03:41.100> driving<00:03:41.340> this<00:03:41.640> this

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
in the brain which is driving this this

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.900 
in the brain which is driving this this
cursor<00:03:42.330> around<00:03:42.570> on<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:42.840> screen<00:03:43.220> so<00:03:44.220> what's

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
cursor around on the screen so what's

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.280 
cursor around on the screen so what's
very<00:03:45.000> exciting<00:03:45.120> is<00:03:45.660> that<00:03:45.690> we're<00:03:46.050> just

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
very exciting is that we're just

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.870 
very exciting is that we're just
starting<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:46.710> see<00:03:46.980> some<00:03:47.190> human<00:03:47.490> trials<00:03:47.790> of

in<00:06:21.879> their<00:06:22.030> in<00:06:22.240> their<00:06:22.360> spinal<00:06:22.719> cord<00:06:22.930> so<00:06:23.680> at<00:06:23.830> this

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:23.949 
in their in their spinal cord so at this

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:25.740 
in their in their spinal cord so at this
stage<00:06:24.190> being<00:06:24.699> able<00:06:24.849> to<00:06:25.030> use<00:06:25.210> monkeys<00:06:25.569> is

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:25.750 
stage being able to use monkeys is

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.809 
stage being able to use monkeys is
essential<00:06:26.229> for<00:06:26.259> us<00:06:26.469> to<00:06:26.530> be<00:06:27.009> able<00:06:27.219> to<00:06:27.340> develop

00:06:27.809 --> 00:06:27.819 
essential for us to be able to develop

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:29.760 
essential for us to be able to develop
the<00:06:27.940> techniques<00:06:28.389> once<00:06:29.110> we<00:06:29.289> have<00:06:29.469> them<00:06:29.620> to<00:06:29.710> a

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:29.770 
the techniques once we have them to a

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:31.559 
the techniques once we have them to a
stage<00:06:30.039> where<00:06:30.310> where<00:06:30.639> it's<00:06:30.759> working<00:06:30.940> well<00:06:31.330> and

00:06:31.559 --> 00:06:31.569 
stage where where it's working well and

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:33.689 
stage where where it's working well and
and<00:06:32.379> we've<00:06:32.680> demonstrated<00:06:32.919> that<00:06:33.550> the

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:33.699 
and we've demonstrated that the

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:35.640 
and we've demonstrated that the
techniques<00:06:34.120> are<00:06:34.300> safe<00:06:34.509> then<00:06:35.110> we<00:06:35.139> can<00:06:35.379> start

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.650 
techniques are safe then we can start

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.379 
techniques are safe then we can start
thinking<00:06:35.830> using<00:06:36.219> thinking<00:06:36.879> of<00:06:36.969> using<00:06:37.150> these

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:37.389 
thinking using thinking of using these

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:39.659 
thinking using thinking of using these
techniques<00:06:37.779> in<00:06:38.050> in<00:06:38.560> patients<00:06:39.099> to<00:06:39.250> actually<00:06:39.520> be

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:39.669 
techniques in in patients to actually be

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:44.039 
techniques in in patients to actually be
able<00:06:39.789> to<00:06:39.939> to<00:06:40.599> restore<00:06:41.259> movements<00:06:41.740> to<00:06:41.889> them
