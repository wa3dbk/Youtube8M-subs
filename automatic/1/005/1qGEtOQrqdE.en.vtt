00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.630 
time one two three come on stone my son
so<00:04:13.110> that's<00:04:13.260> about<00:04:13.470> one<00:04:13.800> second<00:04:14.190> difference<00:04:14.459> I

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
so that's about one second difference I

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.009 
so that's about one second difference I
mean<00:04:15.120> they<00:04:15.209> should<00:04:15.360> be<00:04:15.420> pretty<00:04:15.540> close<00:04:15.750> since

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
mean they should be pretty close since

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.380 
mean they should be pretty close since
they<00:04:16.140> have<00:04:16.260> some<00:04:16.950> more<00:04:17.100> smoke<00:04:17.340> my<00:04:17.700> stupid

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
they have some more smoke my stupid

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.250 
they have some more smoke my stupid
things<00:04:18.510> trying<00:04:18.690> to<00:04:18.780> load<00:04:18.900> again<00:04:19.079> that's

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
things trying to load again that's

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.750 
things trying to load again that's
probably<00:04:19.470> what<00:04:19.620> but<00:04:19.890> I<00:04:20.100> mean<00:04:20.579> they<00:04:20.670> were

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
probably what but I mean they were

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.310 
probably what but I mean they were
pretty<00:04:20.910> close<00:04:21.150> they<00:04:21.480> have<00:04:21.510> some<00:04:21.780> respects

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
pretty close they have some respects

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.690 
pretty close they have some respects
they<00:04:22.440> both<00:04:22.590> have<00:04:22.740> the<00:04:22.830> four<00:04:23.010> gigabytes<00:04:23.370> of<00:04:23.490> RAM

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
they both have the four gigabytes of RAM

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.640 
they both have the four gigabytes of RAM
so<00:04:24.420> I<00:04:24.450> mean<00:04:24.720> that's<00:04:24.840> pretty<00:04:24.990> definitely

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
so I mean that's pretty definitely

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.640 
so I mean that's pretty definitely
faster<00:04:25.800> than<00:04:26.040> my<00:04:26.100> old<00:04:27.110> desktop<00:04:28.110> it<00:04:28.320> took<00:04:28.500> like

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
faster than my old desktop it took like

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.500 
faster than my old desktop it took like
10<00:04:29.010> minutes<00:04:29.220> and<00:04:29.520> then<00:04:29.580> not<00:04:30.000> really<00:04:30.240> but<00:04:30.390> it

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
10 minutes and then not really but it

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.820 
10 minutes and then not really but it
took<00:04:30.600> a<00:04:30.660> long<00:04:30.870> time<00:04:30.990> to<00:04:31.200> open<00:04:31.919> itunes<00:04:33.020> so<00:04:34.020> we'll

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
skype hasn't locked me in because I

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.440 
skype hasn't locked me in because I
didn't<00:04:58.530> put<00:04:58.680> any<00:04:58.830> my<00:04:58.980> information<00:04:59.490> in<00:04:59.610> so<00:05:00.419> that

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
didn't put any my information in so that

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.110 
didn't put any my information in so that
was<00:05:00.660> about<00:05:00.810> one<00:05:01.050> second<00:05:01.380> faster<00:05:01.500> too<00:05:01.860> so<00:05:02.850> far

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
was about one second faster too so far

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.460 
was about one second faster too so far
the<00:05:03.300> maximum<00:05:03.720> loading<00:05:03.870> or<00:05:04.050> payment<00:05:04.320> one

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
the maximum loading or payment one

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.870 
the maximum loading or payment one
second<00:05:04.800> faster<00:05:04.919> which<00:05:05.280> is<00:05:05.400> really<00:05:05.580> a<00:05:05.669> big<00:05:05.850> deal

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
second faster which is really a big deal

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.120 
second faster which is really a big deal
so<00:05:06.600> it<00:05:06.750> got<00:05:06.900> more<00:05:07.140> stuff<00:05:07.290> or<00:05:07.470> onion<00:05:07.770> I<00:05:07.919> think

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
so it got more stuff or onion I think

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.100 
so it got more stuff or onion I think
this<00:05:08.220> you<00:05:08.790> know<00:05:08.910> all<00:05:09.180> the<00:05:09.270> stuff<00:05:09.450> that<00:05:09.510> Windows

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
this you know all the stuff that Windows

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.710 
this you know all the stuff that Windows
Vista<00:05:10.229> runs<00:05:10.590> makes<00:05:11.460> it<00:05:11.640> up<00:05:11.760> a<00:05:11.940> little<00:05:12.150> slower<00:05:12.479> I

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
Vista runs makes it up a little slower I

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.300 
Vista runs makes it up a little slower I
think<00:05:12.960> if<00:05:13.050> you<00:05:13.140> know<00:05:13.260> I<00:05:13.410> quit<00:05:13.890> all<00:05:13.979> that<00:05:14.010> stuff

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
think if you know I quit all that stuff

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.520 
think if you know I quit all that stuff
which<00:05:14.550> i'm<00:05:14.669> not<00:05:14.790> going<00:05:15.030> to<00:05:15.060> this<00:05:15.360> helpful<00:05:15.600> but

Brandon was my life out still shut down
faster<00:06:00.479> I<00:06:00.950> would<00:06:01.950> say<00:06:02.040> I<00:06:02.070> was<00:06:02.250> pretty<00:06:02.340> close<00:06:02.580> so

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
faster I would say I was pretty close so

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.190 
faster I would say I was pretty close so
since<00:06:03.030> I<00:06:03.240> mean<00:06:03.479> he<00:06:03.570> started<00:06:03.870> about<00:06:03.990> two

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.200 
since I mean he started about two

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.930 
since I mean he started about two
seconds<00:06:04.500> after<00:06:04.650> me<00:06:04.890> and<00:06:05.100> finished<00:06:05.789> about

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
seconds after me and finished about

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.520 
seconds after me and finished about
three<00:06:06.510> or<00:06:06.539> four<00:06:06.630> before<00:06:07.020> so<00:06:07.229> i<00:06:07.289> would<00:06:07.380> say

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:07.530 
three or four before so i would say

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.020 
three or four before so i would say
about<00:06:07.650> seven<00:06:08.460> to<00:06:08.520> ten

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030 
about seven to ten

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:10.040 
about seven to ten
